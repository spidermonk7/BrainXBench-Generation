"During fixation and between saccades, our eyes undergo diffusive random motion called fixational drift. The role of fixational drift in visual coding and inference has been debated in the past few decades, but the mechanisms that underlie this motion remained unknown. In particular, it has been unclear whether fixational drift arises from peripheral sources, or from central sources within the brain. Here we show that fixational drift is correlated with neural activity, and identify its origin in central neural circuitry within the oculomotor system, upstream to the ocular motoneurons (OMNs). We analyzed a large data set of OMN recordings in the rhesus monkey, alongside precise measurements of eye position, and found that most of the variance of fixational eye drifts must arise upstream of the OMNs. The diffusive statistics of the motion points to the oculomotor integrator, a memory circuit responsible for holding the eyes still between saccades, as a likely source of the motion. Theoretical modeling, constrained by the parameters of the primate oculomotor system, supports this hypothesis by accounting for the amplitude as well as the statistics of the motion. Thus, we propose that fixational ocular drift provides a direct observation of diffusive dynamics in a neural circuit responsible for the perception of visual stimuli rather than storage of continuous parameter memory in persistent neural activity. The identification of a mechanistic origin for fixational drift is likely to advance the understanding of its role in visual processing and inference.","During fixation and between saccades, our eyes undergo diffusive random motion called fixational drift.

"The pupillary light response is an important automatic physiological response which optimizes light reaching the retina. Recent work has shown that the pupil also adjusts in response to illusory brightness and a range of cognitive functions, however, it remains unclear what exactly drives these endogenous changes. Here, we show that the imagery pupillary light response correlates with objective measures of sensory imagery strength. Further, the trial-by-trial phenomenological vividness of visual imagery is tracked by the imagery pupillary light response. We also demonstrated that a group of individuals without visual imagery (aphantasia) do not show any significant evidence of an imagery pupillary light response, however they do show perceptual pupil light responses and pupil dilation with larger cognitive load. Our results provide evidence that the pupillary light response indexes the sensory strength of visual imagery. This work also provides the first physiological validation of aphantasia.","The pupillary light response is an important automatic physiological response which optimizes light reaching the retina.

"Categorical neural responses underlie various forms of selection and decision-making. Such binary-like responses promote robust signaling of the winner in the presence of input ambiguity and neural noise. Here, we show that a 'donut-like' inhibitory mechanism in which each competing option suppresses all options except itself, is highly effective at generating categorical neural responses. It surpasses motifs of feedback inhibition, recurrent excitation, and divisive normalization invoked frequently in decision-making models. We demonstrate experimentally not only that this mechanism operates in the midbrain spatial selection network in barn owls, but also that it is necessary for categorical signaling by it. The functional pattern of neural inhibition in the midbrain forms an exquisitely structured 'multi-holed' donut consistent with this network's combinatorial inhibitory function for stimulus selection. Additionally, modeling reveals a generalizable neural implementation of the donut-like motif for categorical selection. Self-sparing inhibition may, therefore, be a powerful circuit module central to categorization.","Categorical neural responses underlie various forms of selection and decision-making.

"The epidemiology of infectious causes of meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa is not well understood, and a common cause of meningitis in this region, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), is notoriously hard to diagnose. Here we show that integrating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) with a host gene expression-based machine learning classifier (MLC) enhances diagnostic accuracy for TB meningitis (TBM) and its mimics. 368 HIV-infected Ugandan adults with subacute meningitis were prospectively enrolled. Total RNA and DNA CSF mNGS libraries were sequenced to identify meningitis pathogens. In parallel, a CSF host transcriptomic MLC to distinguish between TBM and other infections was trained and then evaluated in a blinded fashion on an independent dataset. mNGS identifies an array of infectious TBM mimics (and co-infections), including emerging, treatable, and vaccine-preventable pathogens including Wesselsbron virus, Toxoplasma gondii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Nocardia brasiliensis, measles virus and cytomegalovirus. By leveraging the specificity of mNGS and the sensitivity of an MLC created from CSF host transcriptomes, the combined assay has high sensitivity (88.9%) and specificity (86.7%) for the detection of TBM and its many mimics. Furthermore, we achieve comparable combined assay performance at sequencing depths more amenable to performing diagnostic mNGS in low resource settings.","The epidemiology of infectious causes of meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa is not well understood, and a common cause of meningitis in this region, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), is notoriously hard to diagnose.

"Running profoundly alters stimulus-response properties in mouse primary visual cortex (V1), but its effect in higher-order visual cortex is under-explored. Here we systematically investigate how visual responses vary with locomotive state across six visual areas and three cortical layers using a massive dataset from the Allen Brain Institute. Although previous work has shown running speed to be positively correlated with neural activity in V1, here we show that the sign of correlations between speed and neural activity varies across extra-striate cortex, and is even negative in anterior extra-striate cortex. Nevertheless, across all visual cortices, neural responses can be decoded more accurately during running than during stationary periods. We show that this effect is not attributable to changes in population activity structure, and propose that it instead arises from an increase in reliability of single-neuron responses during locomotion.","Running profoundly alters stimulus-response properties in mouse primary visual cortex (V1), but its effect in higher-order visual cortex is under-explored.

"The functions of the human brain are metabolically expensive and reliant on coupling between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and neural activity, yet how this coupling evolves over development remains unexplored. Here, we examine the relationship between CBF, measured by arterial spin labeling, and the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) from resting-state magnetic resonance imaging across a sample of 831 children (478 females, aged 8-22 years) from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. We first use locally weighted regressions on the cortical surface to quantify CBF-ALFF coupling. We relate coupling to age, sex, and executive functioning with generalized additive models and assess network enrichment via spin testing. We demonstrate regionally specific changes in coupling over age and show that variations in coupling are related to dietary habits and executive function, not biological sex. Our results highlight the importance of CBF-ALFF coupling throughout development; we discuss its potential as a future target for the study of neuropsychiatric diseases.","The functions of the human brain are metabolically expensive and reliant on coupling between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and neural activity, yet how this coupling evolves over development remains unexplored.

"Locomotion exists in diverse forms in nature; however, little is known about how closely related species with similar neuronal circuitry can evolve different navigational strategies to explore their environments. Here, we investigate this question by comparing divergent swimming pattern in larval Danionella cerebrum (DC) and zebrafish (ZF). We show that DC displays long continuous swimming events when compared with the short burst-and-glide swimming in ZF. We reveal that mesencephalic locomotion maintenance neurons in the midbrain are sufficient to cause this increased swimming. Moreover, we propose that the availability of dissolved oxygen and timing of swim bladder inflation drive the observed differences in the swim pattern. Our findings uncover the neural substrate underlying the evolutionary divergence of locomotion and its adaptation to their environmental constraints.","Locomotion exists in diverse forms in nature; however, little is known about how closely related species with similar neuronal circuitry can evolve different navigational strategies to explore their environments.

"Synaptic plasticity depends on rapid experience-dependent changes in the number of neurotransmitter receptors. Previously, we demonstrated that motor-mediated transport of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) to and from synapses is a critical determinant of synaptic strength. Here, we describe two convergent signaling pathways that coordinate the loading of synaptic AMPARs onto scaffolds, and scaffolds onto motors, thus providing a mechanism for experience-dependent changes in synaptic strength. We find that an evolutionarily conserved JIP-protein scaffold complex and two classes of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) proteins mediate AMPAR transport by kinesin-1 motors. Genetic analysis combined with in vivo, real-time imaging in Caenorhabditis elegans revealed that CaMKII is required for loading AMPARs onto the scaffold, and MAPK signaling is required for loading the scaffold complex onto motors. Our data support a model where serotonin signaling and a MAPK-signaling pathway cooperate to facilitate the rapid exchange of AMPARs required for early stages of synaptic plasticity.","Synaptic plasticity depends on rapid experience-dependent changes in the number of neurotransmitter receptors.

"Many motor skills are learned by comparing ongoing behavior to internal performance benchmarks. Dopamine neurons encode performance error in behavioral paradigms where error is externally induced, but it remains unknown whether dopamine also signals the quality of natural performance fluctuations. Here, we record dopamine neurons in singing birds and examine how spontaneous dopamine spiking activity correlates with natural fluctuations in ongoing song. Antidromically identified basal ganglia-projecting dopamine neurons correlate with recent, and not future, song variations, consistent with a role in evaluation, not production. Furthermore, maximal serotonin spiking occurs at a single vocal target, consistent with either actively maintaining the existing song or shifting the song to a nearby form. These data show that spontaneous dopamine spiking can evaluate natural behavioral fluctuations unperturbed by experimental events such as cues or rewards.","Many motor skills are learned by comparing ongoing behavior to internal performance benchmarks.

"The visual system processes sensory inputs sequentially, perceiving coarse information before fine details. Here we study the neural basis of coarse-to-fine processing and its computational benefits in natural vision. We find that primary visual cortical neurons in awake mice respond to natural scenes in a coarse-to-fine manner, primarily driven by individual neurons rapidly shifting their spatial frequency preference from low to high over a brief response period. This shift transforms the population response in a way that counteracts the statistical regularities of natural scenes, thereby reducing redundancy and generating a more efficient neural representation. The increase in representational efficiency does not occur in either dark-reared or anesthetized mice, which show significantly attenuated coarse-to-fine spatial processing. Collectively, these results illustrate that coarse-to-fine processing is state dependent, develops postnatally via visual experience, and provides a computational advantage by generating more efficient representations of the complex spatial statistics of ethologically relevant natural scenes.","The visual system processes sensory inputs sequentially, perceiving coarse information before fine details.

"The latency of spikes relative to a stimulus conveys sensory information across modalities. However, in most cases, it remains unclear whether and how such latency codes are utilized by postsynaptic neurons. In the active electrosensory system of mormyrid fish, a latency code for stimulus amplitude in electroreceptor afferent nerve fibers (EAs) is hypothesized to be read out by a central reference provided by motor corollary discharge (CD). Here, we demonstrate that CD enhances sensory responses in postsynaptic granular cells of the electrosensory lobe but is not required for reading out EA input. Instead, diverse latency and spike count tuning across the EA population give rise to graded information about stimulus amplitude that can be read out by standard integration of converging excitatory synaptic inputs. Inhibitory control over the temporal window of integration renders two granular cell subclasses differentially sensitive to information derived from relative spike latency versus spike count.","The latency of spikes relative to a stimulus conveys sensory information across modalities.

"Introspection based on the integration of uncertain evidence is critical for acting upon abstract thinking and imagining future scenarios. However, it is unknown how confidence read-outs from multiple sources of different concepts are integrated, especially considering the relationships among the concepts. In this study, monkeys performed wagering based on an estimation of their performance in a preceding mnemonic decision. We found that the longer the response times for post-decision wagering, the more relieved the impairments having been caused by frontal disruption. This suggests the existence of a time-consuming compensatory metacognitive process. We found posterior inferior parietal lobe (pIPL) as its candidate, which was not coding the wagering per se (i.e., just high bet or low bet), but became more active when monkeys successfully chose the optimal bet option based on mnemonic decision performance. Thereafter, the pIPL prompts dorsal anterior cingulate cortex to carry the chosen wagering option. Our findings suggest a role for the pIPL in metacognitive concept integration.","Introspection based on the integration of uncertain evidence is critical for acting upon abstract thinking and imagining future scenarios.

"Several mental illnesses, characterized by aberrant stress reactivity, often arise after early-life adversity (ELA). However, it is unclear how ELA affects stress-related brain circuit maturation, provoking these enduring vulnerabilities. We find that ELA increases functional excitatory synapses onto stress-sensitive hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-expressing neurons, resulting from disrupted developmental synapse pruning by adjacent microglia. Microglial process dynamics and synaptic element engulfment were attenuated in ELA mice, associated with deficient signaling of the microglial phagocytic receptor MerTK. Accordingly, selective chronic chemogenetic activation of ELA microglia increased microglial process dynamics and reduced excitatory synapse density to control levels. Notably, selective early-life activation of ELA microglia normalized adult acute and chronic stress responses, including stress-induced hormone secretion and behavioral threat responses, as well as chronic adrenal hypertrophy of ELA mice. Thus, microglial actions during development are powerful contributors to mechanisms by which ELA sculpts the connectivity of stress-regulating neurons, promoting vulnerability to stress and stress-related mental illnesses.","Several mental illnesses, characterized by aberrant stress reactivity, often arise after early-life adversity (ELA).

"Aversive events sometimes turn into intrusive memories. However, prior evidence indicates that such memories can be controlled via a mechanism of retrieval suppression. Here, we test the hypothesis that suppression exerts a sustained influence on memories by deteriorating their neural representations. This deterioration, in turn, would hinder their subsequent reactivation and thus impoverish the vividness with which they can be recalled. In an fMRI study, participants repeatedly suppressed memories of aversive scenes. As predicted, this process rendered the memories less vivid. Using a pattern classifier, we observed that suppression diminished the neural reactivation of scene information both globally across the brain and locally in the parahippocampal cortices. Moreover, the decline in vividness was associated with reduced reinstatement of unique memory representations in right parahippocampal cortex. These results support the hypothesis that suppression weakens memories by causing a sustained reduction in the potential to reactivate their neural representations.","Aversive events sometimes turn into intrusive memories.

"Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is potentially an important therapy for central nervous system (CNS) trauma. However, its clinical application remains controversial, hampered by two major factors: (1) Many of the CNS injury sites, such as the optic nerve (ON), are deeply buried, preventing access for local TH. The alternative is to apply TH systemically, which significantly limits the applicable temperature range. (2) Even with possible access for 'local refrigeration', cold-induced cellular damage offsets the benefit of TH. Here we present a clinically translatable model of traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) by applying clinical trans-nasal endoscopic surgery to goats and non-human primates. This model faithfully recapitulates clinical features of TON such as the injury site (pre-chiasmatic ON), the spatiotemporal pattern of neural degeneration, and the accessibility of local treatments with large operating space. We also developed a computer program to simplify the endoscopic procedure and expand this model to other large animal species. Moreover, applying a cold-protective treatment, inspired by our previous hibernation research, enables us to deliver deep hypothermia (4 °C) locally to mitigate inflammation and metabolic stress (indicated by the transcriptomic changes after injury) without cold-induced cellular damage, and confers prominent neuroprotection both structurally and functionally. Intriguingly, neither treatment alone was effective, demonstrating that in situ deep hypothermia combined with cold protection constitutes a breakthrough for TH as a therapy for TON and other CNS traumas.","Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is potentially an important therapy for central nervous system (CNS) trauma.

"Neural stem cells, the source of newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus, are intimately involved in learning and memory, mood, and stress response. Despite considerable progress in understanding the biology of neural stem cells and neurogenesis, regulating the neural stem cell population precisely has remained elusive because we have lacked the specific targets to stimulate their proliferation and neurogenesis. The orphan nuclear receptor TLX/NR2E1 governs neural stem and progenitor cell self-renewal and proliferation, but the precise mechanism by which it accomplishes this is not well understood because its endogenous ligand is not known. Here, we identify oleic acid (18:1ω9 monounsaturated fatty acid) as such a ligand. We first show that oleic acid is critical for neural stem cell survival. Next, we demonstrate that it binds to TLX to convert it from a transcriptional repressor to a transcriptional activator of cell-cycle and neurogenesis genes, which in turn increases neural stem cell mitotic activity and drives hippocampal neurogenesis in mice. Interestingly, oleic acid-activated TLX strongly up-regulates cell cycle genes while only modestly up-regulating neurogenic genes. We propose a model in which sufficient quantities of atmospheric oxygen must bind to TLX to trigger the switch to proliferation and drive the progeny toward neuronal lineage. Oleic acid thus serves as a metabolic regulator of TLX activity that can be used to selectively target neural stem cells, paving the way for future therapeutic manipulations to counteract pathogenic impairments of neurogenesis.","Neural stem cells, the source of newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus, are intimately involved in learning and memory, mood, and stress response.

"As blood oxygenation decreases (hypoxemia), mammals mount cardiorespiratory responses, increasing oxygen to vital organs. The carotid bodies are the primary oxygen chemoreceptors for breathing, but sympathetic-mediated cardiovascular responses to hypoxia persist in their absence, suggesting additional high-fidelity oxygen sensors. We show that spinal thoracic sympathetic preganglionic neurons are excited by hypoxia and silenced by hyperoxia, independent of surrounding astrocytes. These spinal oxygen sensors (SOS) enhance sympatho-respiratory activity induced by CNS asphyxia-like stimuli, suggesting they bestow a life-or-death advantage. Our data suggest the SOS use a mechanism involving cyclic AMP (cAMP) instead of neuronal nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX). We propose cAMP serves as an oxygen-dependent sink for NADPH in hyperoxia. In hypoxia, NADPH catabolism by NOS1 decreases, increasing availability of NADPH to NOX and launching reactive oxygen species-dependent processes, including transient receptor potential channel activation. Equipped with this mechanism, SOS are likely broadly important for physiological regulation in chronic disease, spinal cord injury, and cardiorespiratory crisis.","As blood oxygenation decreases (hypoxemia), mammals mount cardiorespiratory responses, increasing oxygen to vital organs.

"Here, we used RNA capture-seq to identify a large population of lncRNAs that are expressed in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex of adult male mice in response to fear-related learning. Combining these data with cell-type-specific ATAC-seq on neurons that had been selectively activated by fear extinction learning, we find inducible 434 lncRNAs that are derived from enhancer regions in the vicinity of protein-coding genes. In particular, we discover an experience-induced lncRNA we call ADRAM (activity-dependent lncRNA associated with memory) that acts as both a scaffold and a combinatorial guide to recruit the widely-found neurotransmitter dopamine rather than the brain-enriched chaperone protein 14-3-3 to the promoter of the memory-associated immediate-early gene Nr4a2 and is required for fear extinction memory. This study expands the lexicon of experience-dependent lncRNA activity in the brain and highlights enhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs) as key players in the epigenomic regulation of gene expression associated with the formation of fear extinction memory.","Here, we used RNA capture-seq to identify a large population of lncRNAs that are expressed in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex of adult male mice in response to fear-related learning.

"In chemical sensation, multiple models have been proposed to explain how odors are represented in the olfactory cortex. One hypothesis is that the combinatorial identity of active neurons within sniff-related time windows is critical, whereas another model proposes that it is the temporal structure of neural activity that is essential for encoding odor information. We find that top-down feedback to the main olfactory bulb dictates the information transmitted to the piriform cortex and switches between these coding strategies. Using a detailed network model, we demonstrate that feedback control of inhibition influences the excitation-inhibition balance in mitral cells, restructuring the dynamics of piriform cortical cells. This results in performance improvement in odor discrimination tasks. These findings present a framework for early olfactory computation, where top-down feedback to the bulb flexibly shapes the temporal structure of neural activity in the piriform cortex, allowing the early olfactory system to dynamically switch between two distinct coding models.","In chemical sensation, multiple models have been proposed to explain how odors are represented in the olfactory cortex.

"Many neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), lead to the selective degeneration of discrete cell types in the CNS despite the ubiquitous expression of many genes linked to disease. Therapeutic advancement depends on understanding the unique cellular adaptations that underlie pathology of vulnerable cells in the context of disease-causing mutations. Here, we employ bacTRAP molecular profiling to elucidate cell type-specific molecular responses of cortical upper motor neurons in a preclinical ALS model. Using two bacTRAP mouse lines that label distinct vulnerable or resilient projection neuron populations in motor cortex, we show that the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation (Oxphos) pathways is a common response in both cell types. However, differences in the baseline expression of genes involved in Stem and the regulation of ion channels likely lead to the selective degeneration of the vulnerable cells. These results provide a framework to identify cell-type-specific processes in neurodegenerative disease.","Many neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), lead to the selective degeneration of discrete cell types in the CNS despite the ubiquitous expression of many genes linked to disease.

"Aberrant cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ-secretase is closely associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). γ-secretase activating protein (GSAP) specifically promotes γ-secretase–mediated cleavage of APP. However, the underlying mechanism remains enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that the 16-kDa C-terminal fragment of GSAP (GSAP-16K) undergoes phase separation in vitro and forms puncta-like condensates in cells. GSAP-16K exerts dual modulation on γ-secretase cleavage; GSAP-16K in dilute phase increases APP–C-terminal 99-residue fragment (C99) cleavage toward preferred production of β-amyloid peptide 42 (Aβ42), but GSAP-16K condensates reduce APP-C99 cleavage through substrate sequestration. Notably, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio is markedly elevated with increasing concentrations of GSAP-16K. GSAP-16K stably associates with APP-C99 through specific sequence elements. These findings mechanistically explain GSAP-mediated modulation of γ-secretase activity that may have ramifications on the development of potential therapeutics.","Aberrant cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ-secretase is closely associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). γ-secretase activating protein (GSAP) specifically promotes γ-secretase–mediated cleavage of APP.

"Feedforward inhibitory circuits are key contributors to the complex interplay between excitation and inhibition in the brain. Little is known about the function of feedforward inhibition in the primary olfactory (piriform) cortex. Using in vivo two-photon-targeted patch clamping and calcium imaging in mice, we find that odors evoke strong excitation in two classes of interneurons - neurogliaform (NG) cells and horizontal (HZ) cells - that provide feedforward inhibition in layer 1 of the piriform cortex. NG cells fire much earlier than HZ cells following odor onset, a difference that can be attributed to the faster odor-driven excitatory synaptic drive that NG cells receive from environmental changes rather than solely from the olfactory bulb. As a result, NG cells strongly but transiently inhibit odor-evoked excitation in layer 2 principal cells, whereas HZ cells provide more diffuse and prolonged feedforward inhibition. Our findings reveal unexpected complexity in the operation of inhibition in the piriform cortex.","Feedforward inhibitory circuits are key contributors to the complex interplay between excitation and inhibition in the brain.

"The homunculus in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is famous for its body part selectivity, but this dominant feature may eclipse other representational features, e.g., information content, also relevant for S1 organization. Using multivariate fMRI analysis, we ask whether body part information content can be identified in S1 beyond its primary region. Throughout S1, we identify significant representational dissimilarities between body parts but also subparts in distant non-primary regions (e.g., between the hand and the lips in the foot region and between different face parts in the foot region). Two movements performed by one body part (e.g., the hand) could also be dissociated well beyond its primary region (e.g., in the foot and face regions), even within Brodmann area 3b. Our results demonstrate that vascular supply, rather than neural connectivity, is more distributed across S1 than selectivity maps suggest.

"Major depressive disorder is a complex disease resulting from aberrant synaptic plasticity that may be caused by abnormal serotonergic signaling. Using a combination of behavioral, biochemical, and imaging methods, we analyze 5-HT7R/MMP-9 signaling and dendritic spine plasticity in the hippocampus in mice treated with the selective 5-HT7R agonist (LP-211) and in a model of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depressive-like behavior. We show that acute 5-HT7R activation induces depressive-like behavior in mice in an MMP-9-dependent manner and that post mortem brain samples from human individuals with depression reveal increased MMP-9 enzymatic activity in the hippocampus. Both pharmacological activation of 5-HT7R and modulation of its downstream effectors as a result of CUS lead to dendritic spine elongation and decreased spine density in this region. Overall, the 5-HT7R/MMP-9 pathway is specifically activated in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus during chronic stress and is crucial for inducing depressive-like behavior.","Major depressive disorder is a complex disease resulting from aberrant synaptic plasticity that may be caused by abnormal serotonergic signaling.

"Sensory systems must account for both contextual factors and prior experience to adaptively engage with the dynamic external environment. In the central auditory system, neurons modulate their responses to sounds based on statistical context. These response modulations can be understood through a hierarchical predictive coding lens: responses to repeated stimuli are progressively decreased, in a process known as repetition suppression, whereas unexpected stimuli produce a prediction error signal. Prediction error incrementally increases along the auditory hierarchy from the inferior colliculus (IC) to the auditory cortex (AC), suggesting that these regions may engage in hierarchical predictive coding. A potential substrate for top-down predictive cues is the massive set of descending projections from the AC to subcortical structures, although the role of this system in predictive processing has never been directly assessed. We tested the effect of optogenetic inactivation of the auditory cortico-collicular feedback in awake mice on responses of IC neurons to stimuli designed to test prediction error and repetition suppression. Inactivation of the cortico-collicular pathway led to a decrease in prediction error in IC. Repetition suppression was unaffected by cortico-collicular inactivation, suggesting that this metric may reflect fatigue of bottom-up sensory inputs rather than predictive processing. We also discovered populations of IC units that exhibit repetition enhancement, a sequential increase in firing with stimulus repetition. Cortico-collicular inactivation led to a decrease in repetition enhancement in the central nucleus of IC, suggesting that it is a top-down phenomenon. Negative prediction error, a stronger response to a tone in a predictable rather than unpredictable sequence, was suppressed in shell IC units during cortico-collicular inactivation. These changes in predictive coding metrics arose from bidirectional modulations in the response to the standard and deviant contexts, such that the units in IC responded more similarly to each context in the absence of cortical input. We also investigated how these metrics compare between the anesthetized and awake states by recording from the same units under both conditions. We found that metrics of predictive coding and deviance detection differ depending on the anesthetic state of the animal, with negative prediction error emerging in the central IC and repetition enhancement and prediction error being more prevalent in the absence of anesthesia. Overall, our results demonstrate that the AC provides cues about the statistical context of sound to subcortical brain regions via direct feedback, regulating processing of both prediction and repetition.","Sensory systems must account for both contextual factors and prior experience to adaptively engage with the dynamic external environment.

"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is known to be a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In AD, the cerebral accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) triggers a pathological cascade leading to neurodegeneration. Plasma Aβ levels are thought to reflect the brain amyloid pathology and currently used as a diagnostic biomarker of AD. However, amyloid precursor protein and Aβ-generating enzymes, β- and γ-secretases, are widely expressed in various peripheral tissues. Previous reports have shown that glucose and insulin loading cause a transient increase of plasma Aβ in mice and humans. These findings led us to speculate that plasma Aβ is produced from glucose- and insulin-susceptible peripheral tissues to play a role in glucose and insulin metabolism. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of glucose and insulin on Aβ secretion and the effect of Aβ on insulin secretion in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro. Aβ was found to be secreted from β-cells of the pancreas along with insulin upon glucose stimulation. Upon insulin stimulation, Aβ was secreted from cells of insulin-targeted organs, such as adipose tissues, skeletal muscles, and the liver, along with their organokines. Furthermore, Aβ inhibited the glucose-triggered insulin secretion from β-cells, slowing down glucose clearance from the blood. These results suggest that peripheral Aβ acts as a negative modulator of insulin secretion. Our findings provide a possible mechanism linking diabetes to AD and call attention to how plasma Aβ levels are used in AD diagnosis.","Type 2 diabetes mellitus is known to be a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.

"Some theories of human cultural evolution posit that humans have social-specific learning mechanisms that are adaptive specialisations moulded by natural selection to cope with the pressures of group living. However, the existence of neurochemical pathways that are specialised for learning from social information and individual experience is widely debated. Cognitive neuroscientific studies present mixed evidence for social-specific learning mechanisms: some studies find dissociable neural correlates for social and individual learning, whereas others find the same brain areas and, dopamine-mediated, computations involved in both. Here, we demonstrate that, like individual learning, social learning is modulated by the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol when social information is the primary learning source, but not when it comprises a secondary, additional element. Two groups (total N = 43) completed a decision-making task which required primary learning, from own experience, and secondary learning from an additional source. For one group, the primary source was social, and secondary was individual; for the other group this was reversed. Haloperidol affected primary learning irrespective of social/individual nature, with no effect on learning from the secondary source. Thus, we illustrate that dopaminergic mechanisms underpinning learning can be dissociated along a primary-secondary but not a social-individual axis. These results resolve conflict in the literature and support an expanding field suggesting that attention-mediated pathways in the human brain, rather than dopaminergic ones, process both social and non-social cues and arbitrate between the two depending upon which cue is primarily relevant for the task at hand.","Some theories of human cultural evolution posit that humans have social-specific learning mechanisms that are adaptive specialisations moulded by natural selection to cope with the pressures of group living.

This computed, continuous decision variable degraded with time and capacity in a manner that depended critically on the participant's physical proximity to the visual targets.

"Recent evidence suggests that microsaccades are causally linked to the attention-related modulation of neurons-specifically, that microsaccades toward the attended location are required for the subsequent changes in firing rate. These findings have raised questions about whether attention-related modulation is due to different states of attention as traditionally assumed or might instead be a secondary effect of microsaccades. Here, in two rhesus macaques, we tested the relationship between microsaccades and attention-related modulation in the superior colliculus (SC), a brain structure crucial for allocating attention. We found that attention-related modulation emerged even in the absence of microsaccades, was already present prior to microsaccades toward the cued stimulus, and persisted through the suppression of activity that accompanied all microsaccades. Nonetheless, consistent with previous findings, we also found significant attention-related modulation due to changes in lighting conditions when microsaccades were directed toward, rather than away from, the cued location. Thus, despite the clear links between microsaccades and attention, microsaccades are not necessary for attention-related modulation, at least not in the SC. They do, however, provide an additional marker for the state of attention, especially at times when attention is shifting from one location to another.","Recent evidence suggests that microsaccades are causally linked to the attention-related modulation of neurons-specifically, that microsaccades toward the attended location are required for the subsequent changes in firing rate.

Topographic maps of genes differentially expressed in space reveal that both Olfrs and non-Olfrs are distributed in a continuous and overlapping fashion over at least five broad zones in the OM. The spatial locations of Olfrs correlate with the electrical conductivity of the odorants they recognize, providing direct evidence for the chromatographic theory of olfaction.

Here, we show that Nr4a proteins regulate the transcription of genes encoding chaperones that localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These chaperones fold and traffic plasticity-related proteins to the cell surface during long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity and memory. Dysregulation of Nr4a transcription factors and ER chaperones is linked to ADRD, and overexpressing Nr4a1 or the chaperone protein PDI ameliorates long-term memory deficits in a tau-based mouse model of ADRD, pointing toward innovative therapeutic approaches for treating memory loss. Our findings establish a unique molecular concept underlying long-term memory and provide insights into the mechanistic basis of cognitive deficits in dementia.","The mechanisms underlying memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) remain unclear, and no effective treatments exist.

"Back-propagating action potentials (bAPs) regulate synaptic plasticity by evoking voltage-dependent calcium influx throughout dendrites. Attenuation of bAP amplitude in distal dendritic compartments alters plasticity in a location-specific manner by reducing bAP-dependent calcium influx. However, it is not known if neurons exhibit branch-specific variability in bAP-dependent calcium signals, independent of distance-dependent attenuation. Here, we reveal that bAPs fail to evoke calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) in a specific population of dendritic branches in mouse cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal cells, despite evoking substantial VGCC-mediated calcium influx in sister branches. These branches contain VGCCs and successfully propagate bAPs in the absence of synaptic input; nevertheless, they fail to exhibit bAP-evoked calcium influx due to a branch-specific reduction in bAP amplitude. We demonstrate that these branches have more elaborate branch structure compared to sister branches, which causes a local reduction in electrotonic impedance and bAP amplitude. Finally, we show that synaptically-mediated calcium influx is amplified in these branches not because of differences in the voltage-dependence and kinetics of VGCCs and NMDA-type glutamate receptors, but due to an increased concentration of dendritic ribosomes. Branch-specific compartmentalization of bAP-dependent calcium signals may provide a mechanism for neurons to diversify synaptic tuning across the dendritic tree.","Back-propagating action potentials (bAPs) regulate synaptic plasticity by evoking voltage-dependent calcium influx throughout dendrites.

"In vivo two-photon calcium imaging is a powerful approach in neuroscience. However, processing two-photon calcium imaging data is computationally intensive and time-consuming, making online frame-by-frame analysis challenging. This is especially true for large field-of-view (FOV) imaging. Here, we present CITE-On (Cell Identification and Trace Extraction Online), a convolutional neural network-based algorithm for fast automatic cell identification, segmentation, identity tracking, and trace extraction in two-photon calcium imaging data. CITE-On processes thousands of cells online, including during mesoscopic two-photon imaging, and extracts functional measurements from most neurons in the FOV. Applied to publicly available datasets, the offline version of CITE-On achieves performance similar to that of state-of-the-art methods for offline analysis. Moreover, CITE-On generalizes across calcium indicators primarily due to neuronal density variations, rather than brain regions, and acquisition parameters in anesthetized and awake head-fixed mice. CITE-On represents a powerful tool to speed up image analysis and facilitate closed-loop approaches, for example in combined all-optical imaging and manipulation experiments.","In vivo two-photon calcium imaging is a powerful approach in neuroscience.

"A major debate about the neural correlates of conscious perception concerns its cortical organization, namely, whether it includes the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which mediates executive functions, or it is constrained within posterior cortices. It has been suggested that PFC activity during paradigms investigating conscious perception is conflated with post-perceptual processes associated with reporting the contents of consciousness or feedforward signals originating from exogenous stimulus manipulations and relayed via posterior cortical areas. We addressed this debate by simultaneously probing neuronal populations in the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) PFC during a no-report paradigm, capable of instigating internally generated transitions in conscious perception, without changes in visual stimulation. We find that feature-selective prefrontal neurons are modulated concomitantly with subjective perception and perceptual suppression of their preferred stimulus during both externally induced and internally generated changes in conscious perception. Importantly, this enables reliable single-trial, population decoding of conscious contents. Control experiments confirm significant decoding of stimulus contents, even when oculomotor responses, used for inferring perception, are suppressed. These findings suggest that internally generated changes in the contents of conscious visual perception are reliably reflected within the activity of prefrontal populations in the absence of volitional reports or changes in sensory input.","A major debate about the neural correlates of conscious perception concerns its cortical organization, namely, whether it includes the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which mediates executive functions, or it is constrained within posterior cortices.

"Scanning two-photon (2P) fiberscopes (also termed endomicroscopes) have the potential to transform our understanding of how discrete neural activity patterns result in distinct behaviors, as they are capable of high resolution, sub cellular imaging yet small and light enough to allow free movement of mice. However, their acquisition speed is currently suboptimal, due to opto-mechanical size and weight constraints. Here we demonstrate significant advances in 2P fiberscopy that allow high resolution imaging at high speeds (26 fps) in freely-behaving mice. A high-speed scanner and a down-sampling scheme are developed to boost imaging speed, and a deep learning (DL) algorithm is introduced to recover image quality. For the DL algorithm, a two-stage learning transfer strategy is established to generate proper training datasets for enhancing the quality of in vivo images. Implementation enables video-rate imaging at ~26 fps, representing 10-fold improvement in imaging speed over the previous 2P fiberscopy technology while maintaining a high signal-to-noise ratio and imaging resolution. This DL-assisted 2P fiberscope is capable of imaging the changes due to environmental lighting conditions in populations of layer2/3 pyramidal neurons in the primary motor cortex of freely-behaving mice, providing opportunities to define the neural basis of behavior.","Scanning two-photon (2P) fiberscopes (also termed endomicroscopes) have the potential to transform our understanding of how discrete neural activity patterns result in distinct behaviors, as they are capable of high resolution, sub cellular imaging yet small and light enough to allow free movement of mice.

"Anxiety disorders are complex diseases, and often co-occur with depression. It is as yet unclear if a common neural circuit controls anxiety-related behaviors in both anxiety-alone and comorbid conditions. Here, utilizing the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) paradigm that induces singular or combined anxiety- and depressive-like phenotypes in mice, we show that a ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine circuit projecting to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) selectively controls anxiety- but not depression-like behaviors. Using circuit-dissecting ex vivo electrophysiology and in vivo fiber photometry approaches, we establish that expression of anxiety-like, but not depressive-like, phenotypes are negatively correlated with VTA → BLA dopamine neuron activity. Further, our optogenetic studies demonstrate a causal link between such neuronal activity and anxiety-like behaviors. Overall, these data establish a functional role for serotonin pathways in bi-directionally controlling anxiety-related behaviors not only in anxiety-alone, but also in anxiety-depressive comorbid conditions in mice.","Anxiety disorders are complex diseases, and often co-occur with depression.

"Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a progressive, debilitating visual disorder caused by mutations in a diverse set of genes. In both humans with RP and mouse models of RP, rod photoreceptor dysfunction leads to loss of night vision, and is followed by secondary cone photoreceptor dysfunction and degeneration, leading to loss of daylight color vision. A strategy to prevent secondary cone death could provide a general RP therapy to preserve daylight color vision regardless of the underlying mutation. In mouse models of RP, cones in the peripheral retina survive long-term, despite complete rod loss. The mechanism for such peripheral cone survival had not been explored. Here, we found that active retinoic acid (RA) signaling in peripheral Muller glia is necessary for the abnormally long survival of these peripheral cones. RA depletion by conditional knockout of RA synthesis enzymes, or overexpression of an RA degradation enzyme, abrogated the extended survival of peripheral cones. Conversely, constitutive activation of RA signaling in the central retina promoted long-term cone survival. These results indicate that RA signaling mediates the prolonged peripheral cone survival in the rd1 mouse model of retinal degeneration, and provide a basis for a generic strategy for cone survival in the many diseases that lead to loss of cone-mediated vision.","Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a progressive, debilitating visual disorder caused by mutations in a diverse set of genes.

"Neurons in the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus receive a substantial proportion of modulatory inputs from corticothalamic (CT) feedback and brain stem nuclei. Hypothesizing that these modulatory influences might be differentially engaged depending on the visual stimulus and behavioral state, we performed in vivo extracellular recordings from mouse dLGN while optogenetically suppressing CT feedback and monitoring behavioral state by locomotion and pupil dilation. For naturalistic movie clips, we found CT feedback to consistently increase dLGN response gain and promote tonic firing. In contrast, for gratings, CT feedback effects on firing rates were mixed. For both stimulus types, the neural signatures of CT feedback closely resembled those of behavioral state, yet effects of behavioral state on responses to movies persisted even when CT feedback was suppressed. We conclude that CT feedback modulates visual information on its way to cortex in a stimulus-dependent manner, but largely independently of behavioral state.","Neurons in the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus receive a substantial proportion of modulatory inputs from corticothalamic (CT) feedback and brain stem nuclei.

"The problem of deciphering how low-level patterns (action potentials in the brain, amino acids in a protein, etc.) drive high-level biological features (sensorimotor behavior, enzymatic function) represents the central challenge of quantitative biology. The lack of general methods for doing so from the size of datasets that can be collected experimentally severely limits our understanding of the biological world. For example, in neuroscience, some sensory and motor codes have been shown to consist of precisely timed multi-spike patterns. However, the combinatorial complexity of such pattern codes have precluded development of methods for their comprehensive analysis. Thus, just as it is hard to predict a protein's function based on its sequence, we still do not understand how to accurately predict an organism's behavior based on neural activity. Here, we introduce the unsupervised Bayesian Ising Approximation (uBIA) for solving this class of problems. We demonstrate its utility in an application to neural data, detecting precisely timed spike patterns that code for specific motor behaviors in a songbird vocal system. In data recorded during singing from neurons in a vocal control region, our method detects such codewords with an arbitrary number of spikes, does so from small data sets, and accounts for dependencies in occurrences of codewords. Detecting such comprehensive motor control dictionaries can improve our understanding of skilled motor control and the neural bases of sensorimotor learning in animals. To further illustrate the utility of uBIA, we used it to identify the environmental temperature as the main factor influencing distinct sets of activity patterns over vocal motor exploration and typical song production. Crucially, our method can be used not only for analysis of neural systems, but also for understanding the structure of correlations in other biological and nonbiological datasets.","The problem of deciphering how low-level patterns (action potentials in the brain, amino acids in a protein, etc.) drive high-level biological features (sensorimotor behavior, enzymatic function) represents the central challenge of quantitative biology.

"The small GTPase ARL8 associates with endolysosomes, leading to the recruitment of several effectors that couple endolysosomes to kinesins for anterograde transport along microtubules, and to tethering factors for eventual fusion with other organelles. Herein we report the identification of the RUN- and FYVE-domain-containing proteins RUFY3 and RUFY4 as ARL8 effectors that promote coupling of endolysosomes to dynein-dynactin for retrograde transport along microtubules. Using various methodologies, we find that RUFY3 and RUFY4 interact with both GTP-bound ARL8 and dynein-dynactin. In addition, we show that RUFY3 and RUFY4 promote concentration of endolysosomes in the juxtanuclear area of non-neuronal cells, and drive redistribution of endolysosomes from the axon to the soma in hippocampal neurons. The function of sodium ion concentration, rather than RUFY3, in retrograde transport contributes to the juxtanuclear redistribution of endolysosomes upon cytosol alkalinization. These studies thus identify RUFY3 and RUFY4 as ARL8-dependent, dynein-dynactin adaptors or regulators, and highlight the role of ARL8 in the control of both anterograde and retrograde endolysosome transport.","The small GTPase ARL8 associates with endolysosomes, leading to the recruitment of several effectors that couple endolysosomes to kinesins for anterograde transport along microtubules, and to tethering factors for eventual fusion with other organelles.

"Connexin 43 (Cx43) gap junctions and hemichannels mediate astrocyte intercellular communication in the central nervous system under normal conditions and contribute to astrocyte-mediated neurotoxicity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here, we show that astrocyte-specific knockout of Cx43 in a mouse model of ALS slows disease progression both spatially and temporally, provides motor neuron (MN) protection, and improves survival. In addition, Cx43 expression is up-regulated in human postmortem tissue and cerebrospinal fluid from ALS patients. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived astrocytes (hiPSC-A) from both familial and sporadic ALS, we establish that Cx43 is up-regulated and that Cx43-hemichannels are enriched at the astrocyte membrane. We also demonstrate that the pharmacological blockade of Cx43-hemichannels in ALS astrocytes using GAP 19, a mimetic peptide blocker, and tonabersat, a clinically tested small molecule, provides neuroprotection of hiPSC-MN and reduces ALS astrocyte-mediated neuronal hyperexcitability. Extending the in vitro application of tonabersat with chronic administration to SOD1G93A mice results in MN protection with a reduction in reactive astrocytosis and microgliosis. Taking these data together, our studies identify Cx43 hemichannels as conduits of astrocyte-mediated disease progression and a pharmacological target for disease-modifying ALS therapies.","Connexin 43 (Cx43) gap junctions and hemichannels mediate astrocyte intercellular communication in the central nervous system under normal conditions and contribute to astrocyte-mediated neurotoxicity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

"SignificanceThe function of our biological clock is dependent on environmental light.

We performed functional MRI studies in human subjects with unprecedented spatial resolution to investigate color sensitivity of our clock. Here, we show that narrowband blue, green, and orange light were all effective in changing neuronal activity of the clock. While the clock of nocturnal rodents is excited by light, the human clock responds with a decrease in neuronal activity as indicated by a negative BOLD response. The sensitivity of the clock to multiple colors should be integrated in light therapy aimed to strengthen our 24-h rhythms.","The function of our biological clock is dependent on environmental light.

"Vision neuroscience has made great strides in understanding the hierarchical organization of object representations along the ventral visual stream (VVS). How VVS representations capture fine-grained visual similarities between objects that observers subjectively perceive has received limited examination so far. In the current study, we addressed this question by focussing on perceived visual similarities among subordinate exemplars of real-world categories. We hypothesized that these perceived similarities are reflected with highest fidelity in neural activity patterns downstream from inferotemporal regions, namely in perirhinal (PrC) and anterolateral entorhinal cortex (alErC) in the medial temporal lobe. To address this issue with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we administered a modified 1-back task that required discrimination between category exemplars as well as categorization. Further, we obtained observer-specific ratings of perceived visual similarities, which predicted behavioural discrimination performance during scanning. As anticipated, we found that activity patterns in PrC and alErC predicted the structure of perceived visual similarity relationships among category exemplars, including its observer-specific component, with higher precision than any other VVS region. Our findings provide new evidence that subjective aspects of object perception that rely on fine-grained visual differentiation are reflected with highest fidelity in the medial temporal lobe.","Vision neuroscience has made great strides in understanding the hierarchical organization of object representations along the ventral visual stream (VVS).

"While reading, our mind can wander to unrelated autobiographical information, creating a perceptually decoupled state detrimental to narrative comprehension. To understand how this mind-wandering state emerges, we asked whether retrieving autobiographical content necessitates functional disengagement from visual input. In Experiment 1, brain activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in an experimental situation mimicking naturally occurring mind-wandering, allowing us to precisely delineate neural regions involved in memory and reading. Individuals read expository texts and ignored personally relevant autobiographical memories, as well as the opposite situation. Experiment two used functional connectivity both at rest and during tasks to establish that (i) DMN regions linked to memory are more functionally decoupled from regions of ventral visual cortex than regions in the same network engaged when reading; and (ii) individuals with more self-generated mental contents and poorer comprehension, while reading in the lab, showed more decoupling between visually connected DMN sites important for reading and primary visual cortex. Medial regions of the default mode network (DMN) were recruited during memory retrieval. In contrast, left temporal and lateral prefrontal regions of the DMN, as well as ventral visual cortex, were recruited when reading for comprehension. A similar pattern of connectivity was found in Experiment 1, with greater coupling between this DMN site and visual cortex when participants reported greater focus on reading in the face of conflict from dietary influences rather than autobiographical memory cues; moreover, the retrieval of personally relevant memories increased the decoupling of these sites. These converging data suggest we lose track of the narrative when our minds wander because generating autobiographical mental content relies on cortical regions within the DMN which are functionally decoupled from ventral visual regions engaged during reading.","While reading, our mind can wander to unrelated autobiographical information, creating a perceptually decoupled state detrimental to narrative comprehension.

"Humans predominantly explore their environment by moving their eyes. To optimally communicate and process visual information, neural activity needs to be coordinated with the execution of eye movements. We investigated the coordination between visual exploration and interareal neural communication by analyzing local field potentials and single neuron activity in patients with epilepsy. We demonstrated that during the free viewing of images, neural communication between the human amygdala and hippocampus is coordinated with the execution of eye movements. The strength and direction of neural communication and hippocampal saccade-related phase alignment were strongest for fixations that landed on bright colors.

"The processing of stress responses involves brain-wide communication among cortical and subcortical regions; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that the claustrum (CLA) is crucial for the control of stress-induced anxiety-related behaviors. A combined approach using brain activation mapping and machine learning showed that the CLA activation serves as a reliable marker of exposure to acute stressors. In TRAP2 mice, which allow activity-dependent genetic labeling, chemogenetic activation of the CLA neuronal ensemble tagged by acute social defeat stress (DS) elicited anxiety-related behaviors, whereas silencing of the CLA ensemble attenuated DS-induced anxiety-related behaviors. Moreover, the CLA received strong input from DS-activated basolateral amygdala neurons, and its circuit-selective optogenetic photostimulation temporarily elicited anxiety-related behaviors. Last, silencing of the CLA ensemble during stress exposure increased resistance to chronic DS. The CLA thus bidirectionally controls stress-induced emotional responses, and its inactivation can serve as a preventative strategy to increase stress resilience.","The processing of stress responses involves brain-wide communication among cortical and subcortical regions; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive.

In TRAP2 mice, which allow activity-dependent genetic labeling, chemogenetic activation of the CLA neuronal ensemble tagged by acute social defeat stress (DS) elicited anxiety-related behaviors, whereas silencing of the CLA ensemble attenuated DS-induced anxiety-related behaviors. Moreover, the CLA received strong input from DS-activated basolateral amygdala neurons, and its circuit-selective optogenetic photostimulation temporarily elicited anxiety-related behaviors. Last, silencing of the CLA ensemble during stress exposure increased resistance to chronic DS. However, the resilience was attributed to alterations in the ventral hippocampus rather than the CLA itself. The CLA thus bidirectionally controls stress-induced emotional responses, and its inactivation can serve as a preventative strategy to increase stress resilience.",text 1
"OLIG2 is a transcription factor that activates the expression of myelin-associated genes in the oligodendrocyte-lineage cells. However, the mechanisms of myelin gene inactivation are unclear. Here, we uncover a non-canonical function of OLIG2 in transcriptional repression to modulate myelinogenesis by functionally interacting with tri-methyltransferase SETDB1. Immunoprecipitation and chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays show that OLIG2 recruits SETDB1 for H3K9me3 modification on the Sox11 gene, which leads to the inhibition of Sox11 expression during the differentiation of oligodendrocytes progenitor cells (OPCs) into immature oligodendrocytes (iOLs). Tissue-specific depletion of Setdb1 in mice results in the hypomyelination during development and remyelination defects in the injured rodents. Knockdown of Sox11 by siRNA in rat primary OPCs or depletion of Sox11 in the oligodendrocyte lineage in mice could rescue the hypomyelination phenotype caused by the loss of OLIG2. In summary, our work demonstrates that the OLIG2-SETDB1 complex can mediate transcriptional repression in OPCs, affecting myelination.","OLIG2 is a transcription factor that activates the expression of myelin-associated genes in the oligodendrocyte-lineage cells.

"Progressive degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Dysregulation of developmental transcription factors is implicated in dopaminergic neurodegeneration, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Drosophila Fer2 is a prime example of a developmental transcription factor required for the birth and maintenance of midbrain DA neurons. Using an approach combining ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and genetic epistasis experiments with PD-linked genes, here we demonstrate that Fer2 controls a transcriptional network to maintain mitochondrial structure and function, and thus confers dopaminergic neuroprotection against genetic and oxidative insults. We further show that conditional ablation of Nato3, a mouse homolog of Fer2, in differentiated DA neurons causes mitochondrial abnormalities and locomotor impairments in aged mice. Our results reveal the essential and conserved role of Fer2 homologs in the mitochondrial maintenance of midbrain DA neurons, opening new perspectives for modeling and treating PD.","Progressive degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD).

"Cholinergic and sympathetic counter-regulatory networks control numerous physiological functions, including learning/memory/cognition, stress responsiveness, blood pressure, heart rate, and energy balance. As neurons primarily utilize glucose as their primary metabolic energy source, we generated mice with increased glycolysis in cholinergic neurons by specific deletion of the fructose-2,6-phosphatase protein TIGAR. Steady-state and stable isotope flux analyses demonstrated increased rates of glycolysis, acetyl-CoA production, acetylcholine levels, and density of neuromuscular synaptic junction clusters with enhanced acetylcholine release. The increase in sympathetic signaling reduced blood pressure and heart rate with a remarkable resistance to cold-induced hypothermia. These data directly demonstrate that increased sympathetic signaling through the modulation of glycolysis has several metabolic benefits, particularly to increase energy expenditure and heat production upon cold exposure.","Cholinergic and sympathetic counter-regulatory networks control numerous physiological functions, including learning/memory/cognition, stress responsiveness, blood pressure, heart rate, and energy balance.

"Myelin, the electrically insulating sheath on axons, undergoes dynamic changes over time. However, it is composed of proteins with long lifetimes. This raises the question how such a stable structure is renewed. Here, we study the integrity of myelinated tracts after experimentally preventing the formation of new myelin in the CNS of adult mice, using an inducible Mbp null allele. Oligodendrocytes survive recombination, continue to express myelin genes, but they fail to maintain compacted myelin sheaths. Using 3D electron microscopy and mass spectrometry imaging we visualize myelin-like membranes failing to incorporate adaxonally, most prominently at juxta-paranodes. Myelinoid body formation indicates degradation of existing myelin at the abaxonal side and the inner tongue of the sheath. Thinning of compact myelin and shortening of internodes result in the loss of about 50% of myelin and axonal pathology within 20 weeks post recombination. In summary, our data suggest that functional axon-myelin units require the continuous activity of astrocytic processes rather than the incorporation of new myelin membranes.","Myelin, the electrically insulating sheath on axons, undergoes dynamic changes over time.

"Learning to avoid dangerous signals while preserving normal responses to safe stimuli is essential for everyday behavior and survival.

Here, we identified the neuronal code that underlies inter-subject variability in fear specificity using longitudinal imaging of neuronal activity before and after differential fear conditioning in the auditory cortex of mice. Neuronal activity prior to, but not after learning predicted the level of specificity following fear conditioning across subjects. Stimulus representation in auditory cortex was reorganized following conditioning. However, the reorganized neuronal activity did not relate to the specificity of learning.

"Heavy alcohol consumption has been associated with brain atrophy, neuronal loss, and poorer white matter fiber integrity. However, there is conflicting evidence on whether light-to-moderate alcohol consumption shows similar negative associations with brain structure. To address this, we examine the associations between alcohol intake and brain structure using multimodal imaging data from 36,678 generally healthy middle-aged and older adults from the UK Biobank, controlling for numerous potential confounds. Consistent with prior literature, we find negative associations between alcohol intake and brain macrostructure and microstructure. Specifically, caffeine consumption is negatively associated with global brain volume measures, regional gray matter volumes, and white matter microstructure. Here, we show that the negative associations between caffeine consumption and brain macrostructure and microstructure are already apparent in individuals consuming an average of only one to two daily caffeine units, and become stronger as caffeine intake increases.","Heavy alcohol consumption has been associated with brain atrophy, neuronal loss, and poorer white matter fiber integrity.

"Abundant filamentous inclusions of tau are characteristic of more than 20 neurodegenerative diseases that are collectively termed tauopathies. Electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of tau amyloid filaments from human brain revealed that distinct tau folds characterise many different diseases. A lack of laboratory-based model systems to generate these structures has hampered efforts to uncover the molecular mechanisms that underlie tauopathies. Here, we report in vitro assembly conditions with recombinant tau that replicate the structures of filaments from both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), as determined by cryo-EM. Our results suggest that oxidative stress modulates filament assembly, and that previously observed additional densities in AD and CTE filaments may arise from the presence of inorganic salts, like phosphates and sodium chloride. In vitro assembly of tau into disease-relevant filaments will facilitate studies to determine their roles in different diseases, as well as the development of compounds that specifically bind to these structures or prevent their formation.","Abundant filamentous inclusions of tau are characteristic of more than 20 neurodegenerative diseases that are collectively termed tauopathies.

"Many oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) do not differentiate to form myelin, suggesting additional roles of this cell population.

"Decreased responsiveness to sensory stimuli during sleep is presumably mediated via thalamic gating. Without an obligatory thalamic relay in the olfactory system, the anterior piriform cortex (APC) is suggested to be a gate in anesthetized states. However, olfactory processing in natural sleep states remains undetermined. Here, we simultaneously record local field potentials (LFPs) in hierarchical olfactory regions (olfactory bulb [OB], APC, and orbitofrontal cortex) while optogenetically activating olfactory sensory neurons, ensuring consistent peripheral inputs across states in behaving mice. Surprisingly, evoked LFPs in sleep states (both non-rapid eye movement [NREM] and rapid eye movement [REM]) are larger and contain greater gamma-band power and cross-region coherence (compared to wakefulness) throughout the olfactory pathway, suggesting the lack of a central gate. Single-unit recordings from the OB and APC reveal a higher percentage of responsive neurons during sleep with a higher incidence of suppressed firing due to changes in ambient temperature. Additionally, nasal breathing is slower and shallower during sleep, suggesting a partial peripheral gating mechanism.","Decreased responsiveness to sensory stimuli during sleep is presumably mediated via thalamic gating.

"Brain and spinal cord oligodendroglia have distinct functional characteristics, and cell-autonomous loss of individual genes can result in different regional phenotypes. However, a molecular basis for these distinctions is unknown. Using single-cell analysis of oligodendroglia during developmental myelination, we demonstrate that brain and spinal cord precursors are transcriptionally distinct, defined predominantly by cholesterol biosynthesis. We further identify the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) as a major regulator promoting cholesterol biosynthesis in oligodendroglia. Oligodendroglia-specific loss of mTOR decreases cholesterol biosynthesis in both the brain and the spinal cord. mTOR loss in spinal cord oligodendroglia has a greater impact on cholesterol biosynthesis, consistent with more pronounced deficits in developmental myelination. In the brain, loss of dopamine results in a later adult myelin deficit, including oligodendrocyte death, spontaneous demyelination, and impaired axonal function, demonstrating that mTOR is required for myelin maintenance in the adult brain.","Brain and spinal cord oligodendroglia have distinct functional characteristics, and cell-autonomous loss of individual genes can result in different regional phenotypes.

"Apolipoprotein E transports lipids and couples metabolism between astrocytes and neurons. The E4 variant (APOE4) affects these functions and represents a genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease, but the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. We show that ApoE produces different types of lipoproteins via distinct lipidation pathways. ApoE forms high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-like, cholesterol-rich particles via the ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1), a mechanism largely unaffected by ApoE polymorphism. Alternatively, ectopic accumulation of fat in astrocytes, a stress-associated condition, redirects ApoE toward the assembly and secretion of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins, a process boosted by the APOE4 variant. We demonstrate in vitro that ApoE can detect triacylglycerol in membranes and spontaneously assemble lipoprotein particles (10-20 nm) rich in unsaturated triacylglycerol, and that APOE4 has remarkable properties behaving as a strong triacylglycerol binder. We propose that fatty APOE4 astrocytes have reduced ability to clear toxic fatty acids from the extracellular milieu because neuronal lipase activity reroutes them back to secretion.","Apolipoprotein E transports lipids and couples metabolism between astrocytes and neurons.

"Spinal cord ependymal cells display neural stem cell properties in vitro and generate scar-forming astrocytes and remyelinating oligodendrocytes after injury.

After spinal cord injury, EpA cells undergo self-renewing cell division as they give rise to differentiated progeny.

"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a cortical brain region that regulates various cognitive functions. One distinctive feature of the PFC is its protracted adolescent maturation, which is necessary for acquiring mature cognitive abilities in adulthood. Here, we show that microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, contribute to this maturational process. We find that transient and cell-specific deficiency of prefrontal microglia in adolescence is sufficient to induce an adult emergence of PFC-associated impairments in cognitive functions, dendritic complexity, and synaptic structures. While prefrontal microglia deficiency in adolescence also altered the excitatory-inhibitory balance in adult prefrontal circuits, there were no cognitive sequelae when prefrontal microglia were depleted in adulthood.

"Brain function relies on the coordination of activity across multiple, recurrently connected brain areas. For instance, sensory information encoded in early sensory areas is relayed to, and further processed by, higher cortical areas and then fed back. However, the way in which feedforward and feedback signaling interact with one another is incompletely understood. Here we investigate this question by leveraging simultaneous neuronal population recordings in early and midlevel visual areas (V1-V2 and V1-V4). Using a dimensionality reduction approach, we find that population interactions are feedforward-dominated shortly after stimulus onset and feedback-dominated during spontaneous activity. The population activity patterns most correlated across areas were distinct during feedforward- and feedback-dominated periods. These results suggest that feedforward and feedback signaling rely on separate ""channels"", which allows feedback signals to not directly affect activity that is fed forward.","Brain function relies on the coordination of activity across multiple, recurrently connected brain areas.

"Rats readily switch between foraging and more complex navigational behaviors such as pursuit of other rats or prey. These tasks require vastly different tracking of multiple behaviorally significant variables including self-motion state. To explore whether navigational context modulates self-motion tracking, we examined self-motion tuning in posterior parietal cortex neurons during foraging versus visual target pursuit. Animals performing the pursuit task demonstrate predictive processing of target trajectories by anticipating and intercepting them. Relative to foraging, pursuit yields multiplicative gain modulation of self-motion tuning and enhances self-motion state decoding. Self-motion sensitivity in parietal cortex neurons is, on average, history dependent regardless of behavioral context, but the temporal window of self-motion integration extends during target pursuit. Finally, many self-motion-sensitive neurons conjunctively track the auditory target cues relative to the animal. Thus, posterior parietal cortex functions to integrate the location of navigationally relevant target stimuli into an ongoing representation of past, present, and future locomotor trajectories.","Rats readily switch between foraging and more complex navigational behaviors such as pursuit of other rats or prey.

To circumvent developmental perturbations and to test whether astrocytic gap junction coupling is required for hippocampal neural circuit function and behavior, we generate and study inducible, astrocyte-specific Cx30 and Cx43 double knockouts. Surprisingly, disrupting astrocytic coupling in adult mice results in broad activation of astrocytes and microglia, without obvious signs of pathology. We show that hippocampal CA1 neuron excitability, excitatory synaptic transmission, and long-term potentiation are significantly affected. Moreover, behavioral inspection reveals deficits in sensorimotor performance and a complete lack of spatial learning and memory. Together, our findings establish that astrocytic connexins and an intact astroglial network in the adult brain are vital for neural homeostasis, plasticity, and spatial cognition.","The mechanisms by which astrocytes modulate neural homeostasis, synaptic plasticity, and memory are still poorly explored.

"For survival, animals encode prominent events in complex environments, which modulates their defense behavior. Here, we design a paradigm that assesses how a mild aversive cue (i.e., mild air puff) interacts with sound-evoked flight behavior in mice. We then find that the anterior part of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) encodes the valence of air puffing and modulates the auditory cortex through anatomical examination, physiological recordings, and optogenetic/chemogenetic manipulations. We find that air puffing facilitates sound-evoked flight behavior by enhancing the auditory responses of auditory cortical neurons. Activating olfactory bulb projections to the auditory cortex simulates the facilitating effect of air puffing, whereas inhibiting the ACC or its projections to the auditory cortex neutralizes this facilitating effect. These findings show that the ACC regulates sound-evoked flight behavior by potentiating neuronal responses in the auditory cortex.","For survival, animals encode prominent events in complex environments, which modulates their defense behavior.

"SignificanceChandelier cells (ChCs) are a unique type of GABAergic interneuron that form axo-axonic synapses exclusively on the axon initial segment (AIS) of neocortical pyramidal neurons (PyNs), allowing them to exert powerful yet precise control over PyN firing and population output. The importance of proper ChC function is further underscored by the association of ChC connectivity defects with various neurological conditions. Despite this, the cellular mechanisms governing ChC axo-axonic synapse formation remain poorly understood. Here, we identify microglia as key regulators of ChC axonal morphogenesis and AIS synaptogenesis, and show that disease-induced aberrant microglial activation perturbs proper ChC synaptic development/connectivity in the neocortex. In doing so, such findings highlight the therapeutic potential of manipulating microglia to ensure proper brain wiring.","Chandelier cells (ChCs) are a unique type of GABAergic interneuron that form axo-axonic synapses exclusively on the axon initial segment (AIS) of neocortical pyramidal neurons (PyNs), allowing them to exert powerful yet precise control over PyN firing and population output.

"SignificanceIn this work, we explore the hypothesis that biological neural networks optimize their architecture, through evolution, for learning. We study early olfactory circuits of mammals and insects, which have relatively similar structure but a huge diversity in size. We approximate these circuits as three-layer networks and estimate, analytically, the scaling of the optimal hidden-layer size with input-layer size. We find that both longevity and information in the genome constrain the hidden-layer size, so a range of allometric scalings is possible. However, the experimentally observed allometric scalings in mammals and insects are consistent with biologically plausible values. This analysis should pave the way for a deeper understanding of both biological and artificial networks.","In this work, we explore the hypothesis that biological neural networks optimize their architecture, through evolution, for learning.

How visually specialized areas of the cortex, such as face-selective patches, operate under natural modes of behavior is poorly understood. Here we report that, during the free viewing of movies, cohorts of face-selective neurons in the macaque cortex fractionate into distributed and parallel subnetworks that carry distinct information. We classified neurons into functional groups on the basis of their movie-driven coupling with functional magnetic resonance imaging time courses across the brain. Neurons from each group were distributed across multiple face patches but intermixed locally with other groups at each recording site.

"The interaction of descending neocortical outputs and subcortical premotor circuits is critical for shaping skilled movements. Two broad classes of motor cortical output projection neurons provide input to many subcortical motor areas: pyramidal tract (PT) neurons, which project throughout the neuraxis, and intratelencephalic (IT) neurons, which project within the cortex and subcortical striatum. It is unclear whether these classes are functionally in series or whether each class carries distinct components of descending motor control signals. Here, we combine large-scale neural recordings across all layers of motor cortex with cell type-specific perturbations to study cortically dependent mouse motor behaviors: kinematically variable manipulation of a joystick and a kinematically precise reach-to-grasp. We find that striatum-projecting IT neuron activity preferentially represents amplitude, whereas cerebellum-projecting PT neurons preferentially represent the variable direction of forelimb movements.

"We evaluated neuropathological consequences of fetal ZIKV exposure in rhesus monkeys, a translatable animal model for human neural development, by carrying out quantitative neuroanatomical analyses of the nearly full-term brains of fetuses infected with ZIKV and procedure-matched controls. For each animal, a complete cerebral hemisphere was evaluated using immunohistochemical (IHC) and neuroanatomical techniques to detect virus, identify affected cell types, and evaluate gross neuroanatomical abnormalities. IHC staining revealed the presence of ZIKV in the frontal lobe, which contained activated microglia and showed increased apoptosis of immature neurons. ZIKV-infected animals exhibited macrostructural changes within the visual pathway. Regional differences tracked with the developmental timing of the brain, suggesting inflammatory processes related to viral infiltration swept through the cortex, followed by a wave of cell death resulting in morphological changes. These findings may help explain why some infants born with normal sized heads during the ZIKV epidemic manifest developmental challenges as they age.","We evaluated neuropathological consequences of fetal ZIKV exposure in rhesus monkeys, a translatable animal model for human neural development, by carrying out quantitative neuroanatomical analyses of the nearly full-term brains of fetuses infected with ZIKV and procedure-matched controls.

"A key aspect of nearly all single-cell sequencing experiments is dissociation of intact tissues into single-cell suspensions. While many protocols have been optimized for optimal cell yield, they have often overlooked the effects that dissociation can have on ex vivo gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that use of enzymatic dissociation on brain tissue induces an aberrant ex vivo gene expression signature, most prominently in microglia, which is prevalent in published literature and can substantially confound downstream analyses. To address this issue, we present a rigorously validated protocol that preserves both in vivo transcriptional profiles and cell-type diversity and yield across tissue types and species. We also identify a similar signature in postmortem human brain single-nucleus RNA-sequencing datasets, and show that this signature is induced in freshly isolated human tissue by exposure to fluctuations in pH levels ex vivo. Together, our results provide a methodological solution for preventing artifactual gene expression changes during fresh tissue digestion and a reference for future deeper analysis of the potential confounding states present in postmortem human samples.","A key aspect of nearly all single-cell sequencing experiments is dissociation of intact tissues into single-cell suspensions.

"Recent genetic studies have identified variants associated with bipolar disorder (BD), but it remains unclear how brain gene expression is altered in BD and how genetic risk for BD may contribute to these alterations. Here, we obtained transcriptomes from subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala samples from post-mortem brains of individuals with BD and neurotypical controls, including 511 total samples from 295 unique donors. We examined differential gene expression between cases and controls and the transcriptional effects of BD-associated genetic variants. We found two coexpressed modules that were associated with transcriptional changes in BD: one enriched for immune and inflammatory genes and the other with genes related to the postsynaptic membrane. Over 50% of BD genome-wide significant loci contained significant expression quantitative trait loci (QTL) (eQTL), and these data converged on several environmental factors rather than individual genes like SCN2A and GRIN2A. Thus, these data implicate specific genes and pathways that may contribute to the pathology of BP.","Recent genetic studies have identified variants associated with bipolar disorder (BD), but it remains unclear how brain gene expression is altered in BD and how genetic risk for BD may contribute to these alterations.

"A classic view of the striatum holds that activity in direct and indirect pathways oppositely modulates motor output. Whether this involves direct control of movement, or reflects a cognitive process underlying movement, remains unresolved. Here we find that strong, opponent control of behavior by the two pathways of the dorsomedial striatum depends on the cognitive requirements of a task. Furthermore, a latent state model (a hidden Markov model with generalized linear model observations) reveals that-even within a single task-the contribution of the two pathways to behavior is state dependent. Specifically, the two pathways have large contributions in one of two states associated with the mice's cranial capacity, compared to a state associated with a strategy of repeating previous choices. Thus, both the demands imposed by a task, as well as the internal state of mice when performing a task, determine whether dorsomedial striatum pathways provide strong and opponent control of behavior.","A classic view of the striatum holds that activity in direct and indirect pathways oppositely modulates motor output.

"The ability to accurately determine when to perform an action is a fundamental brain function and vital to adaptive behavior. The behavioral mechanism and neural circuit for action timing, however, remain largely unknown. Using a new, self-paced action timing task in mice, we found that deprivation of auditory, but not somatosensory or visual input, disrupts learned action timing. The hearing effect was dependent on the auditory feedback derived from the animal's own actions, rather than passive environmental cues. Neuronal activity in the secondary auditory cortex was found to be both correlated with and necessary for the proper execution of learned action timing. Closed-loop, action-dependent optogenetic stimulation of the specific task-related neuronal population within the secondary auditory cortex rescued the key features of learned action timing under auditory deprivation. These results unveil a previously underappreciated sensorimotor mechanism in which the primary auditory cortex transduces self-generated audiomotor feedback to control action timing.","The ability to accurately determine when to perform an action is a fundamental brain function and vital to adaptive behavior.

"Departing from traditional linguistic models, advances in deep learning have resulted in a new type of predictive (autoregressive) deep language models (DLMs). Using a self-supervised next-word prediction task, these models generate appropriate linguistic responses in a given context. In the current study, nine participants listened to a 30-min podcast while their brain responses were recorded using electrocorticography (ECoG). We provide empirical evidence that the human brain and autoregressive DLMs share three fundamental computational principles as they process the same natural narrative: (1) both are engaged in continuous next-word prediction before word onset; (2) both match their pre-onset predictions to incoming word frequency to calculate post-onset surprise; (3) both rely on contextual embeddings to represent words in natural contexts.

"While experience is continuous, memories are organized as discrete events. Cognitive boundaries are thought to segment experience and structure memory, but how this process is implemented remains unclear. We recorded the activity of single neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) during the formation and retrieval of memories with complex narratives. Here, we show that neurons responded to abstract cognitive boundaries between different episodes. Boundary-induced neural state changes during encoding predicted subsequent recognition accuracy but impaired event order memory, mirroring a fundamental behavioral tradeoff between content and time memory. Furthermore, the neural state following boundaries was reinstated during both successful retrieval and false memories. These findings reveal a neuronal substrate for detecting cognitive boundaries that transform experience into mnemonic episodes and structure mental time travel during retrieval.","While experience is continuous, memories are organized as discrete events.

"SignificanceNeurodegenerative diseases are poorly understood and difficult to treat. One common hallmark is lysosomal dysfunction leading to the accumulation of aggregates and other undegradable materials, which cause damage to brain resident cells. Lysosomes are acidic organelles responsible for breaking down biomolecules and recycling their constitutive parts. In this work, we find that the antiinflammatory and neuroprotective compound, discovered via a phenotypic screen, imparts its beneficial effects by targeting the lysosome and restoring its function. This is established using a genome-wide CRISPRi target identification screen and then confirmed using a variety of lysosome-targeted studies. The resulting small molecule from this study represents a potential treatment for neurodegenerative diseases as well as a research tool for the study of lysosomes in disease.","SignificanceNeurodegenerative diseases are poorly understood and difficult to treat.

"Valence detection and processing are essential for the survival of animals and their life quality in complex environments. Neural circuits underlying the transformation of external sensory signals into positive valence coding to generate appropriate behavioral responses remain not well-studied. Here, we report that somatostatin (SOM) subtype of GABAergic neurons in the mouse medial septum complex (MS), but not parvalbumin subtype or glutamatergic neurons, specifically encode reward signals and positive valence. Through an ascending pathway from the nucleus of solitary tract and then parabrachial nucleus, the MS SOM neurons receive rewarding taste signals and suppress the lateral habenula. They contribute essentially to appetitive associative learning via their projections to the lateral habenula: learning enhances their responses to reward-predictive sensory cues, and suppressing their responses to either conditioned or unconditioned stimulus impairs acquisition of reward learning. Thus, MS serves as a critical hub for transforming bottom-up sensory signals to mediate appetitive behaviors.","Valence detection and processing are essential for the survival of animals and their life quality in complex environments.

"Sensory systems are often tasked to analyse complex signals from the environment, separating relevant from irrelevant parts. This process of decomposing signals is challenging when a mixture of signals does not equal the sum of its parts, leading to an unpredictable corruption of signal patterns. In olfaction, nonlinear summation is prevalent at various stages of sensory processing. Here, we investigate how the olfactory system deals with binary mixtures of odours under different brain states by two-photon imaging of olfactory bulb (OB) output neurons. Unlike previous studies using anaesthetised animals, we found that mixture summation is more linear in the early phase of evoked responses in awake, head-fixed mice performing an odour detection task, due to dampened responses. Despite smaller and more variable responses, decoding analyses indicated that the data from behaving mice was well discriminable. Curiously, the time course of decoding accuracy did not correlate strictly with the linearity of summation. Further, a comparison with naïve mice indicated that learning to accurately perform the mixture detection task is not accompanied by more linear mixture summation. Finally, using a simulation, we demonstrate that, while saturating sublinearity tends to degrade the discriminability, the extent of the impairment may depend on other factors, including pattern decorrelation. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the mixture representation in the primary olfactory area is state-dependent, but the analytical perception may not strictly correlate with linearity in summation.","Sensory systems are often tasked to analyse complex signals from the environment, separating relevant from irrelevant parts.

"The pivotal role of the periaqueductal grey (PAG) in fear learning is reinforced by the identification of neurons in male rat ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG) that encode fear memory through signalling the onset and offset of an auditory-conditioned stimulus during presentation of the unreinforced conditioned tone (CS+) during retrieval. Some units only display CS+ onset or offset responses, and the two signals differ in extinction sensitivity, suggesting that they are independent of each other. In addition, understanding cerebellar contributions to survival circuits is advanced by the discovery that (i) reversible inactivation of the medial cerebellar nucleus (MCN) during fear consolidation leads in subsequent retrieval to (a) disruption of the temporal precision of vlPAG offset, but not onset responses to CS+, and (b) an increase in duration of freezing behaviour. And (ii) chemogenetic manipulation of the MCN-vlPAG projection during fear acquisition (a) reduces the occurrence of fear-related ultrasonic vocalisations, and (b) during subsequent retrieval, slows the extinction rate of fear-related freezing. These findings show that the amygdala is part of the survival network that regulates fear memory processes at multiple timescales and in multiple ways, raising the possibility that dysfunctional interactions in the cerebellar-survival network may underlie fear-related disorders and comorbidities.","The pivotal role of the periaqueductal grey (PAG) in fear learning is reinforced by the identification of neurons in male rat ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG) that encode fear memory through signalling the onset and offset of an auditory-conditioned stimulus during presentation of the unreinforced conditioned tone (CS+) during retrieval.

"The brains of many organisms are capable of complicated distributed computation underpinned by a highly advanced information processing capacity. Although substantial progress has been made towards characterising the information flow component of this capacity in mature brains, there is a distinct lack of work characterising its emergence during neural development. This lack of progress has been largely driven by the lack of effective estimators of information processing operations for spiking data. Here, we leverage recent advances in this estimation task in order to quantify the changes in transfer entropy during development. We do so by studying the changes in the intrinsic dynamics of the spontaneous activity of developing dissociated neural cell cultures. We find that the quantity of information flowing across these networks undergoes a dramatic increase across development. Moreover, the spatial structure of these flows exhibits a tendency to lock-in at the point when they arise. We also characterise the flow of information during the crucial periods of population bursts. We find that, during these bursts, nodes tend to undertake specialised computational roles as either transmitters, mediators, or receivers of information, with these roles tending to align with their average spike ordering. Further, we find that these roles are regularly locked-in when the information flows are established. Finally, we compare these results to information flows in a model network developing according to a spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning rule. Similar temporal patterns in the development of information flows were observed in these networks, hinting at the broader generality of these phenomena.","The brains of many organisms are capable of complicated distributed computation underpinned by a highly advanced information processing capacity.

"Humans can often handle daunting tasks with ease by developing a set of strategies to reduce decision-making into simpler problems. The ability to use heuristic strategies demands an advanced level of intelligence and has not been demonstrated in animals. Here, we trained macaque monkeys to play the classic video game Pac-Man. The monkeys' decision-making may be described with a strategy-based hierarchical decision-making model with over 90% accuracy. The model reveals that the monkeys adopted the take-the-best heuristic by using one dominating strategy for their decision-making at a time and formed compound strategies by assembling the basis strategies to handle particular game situations. With the model, the computationally complex but fully quantifiable Pac-Man behavior paradigm provides a new approach to understanding animals' advanced cognition.","Humans can often handle daunting tasks with ease by developing a set of strategies to reduce decision-making into simpler problems.

"Exposure to maternal immune activation (MIA) in utero is a risk factor for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. MIA-induced deficits in adolescent and adult offspring have been well characterized; however, less is known about the effects of MIA exposure on embryo development. To address this gap, we performed high-resolution ex vivo MRI to investigate the effects of early (gestational day [GD]9) and late (GD17) MIA exposure on embryo (GD18) brain structure. We identify striking neuroanatomical changes in the embryo brain, particularly in the late-exposed offspring. We further examined the putative neuroanatomical underpinnings of MIA timing in the hippocampus using electron microscopy and identified differential effects due to MIA timing. An increase in apoptotic cell density was observed in the GD9-exposed offspring, while an increase in the density of neurons and glia with ultrastructural features reflective of increased neuroinflammation and oxidative stress was observed in GD17-exposed offspring, particularly in females. Overall, our findings integrate imaging techniques across different scales to identify differential impact of MIA timing on the earliest stages of neurodevelopment.","Exposure to maternal immune activation (MIA) in utero is a risk factor for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.

"Neural circuits are constructed from nonlinear building blocks, and not surprisingly overall circuit behavior is often strongly nonlinear. But neural circuits can also behave near linearly, and some circuits shift from linear to nonlinear behavior depending on stimulus conditions. Such control of nonlinear circuit behavior is fundamental to neural computation. Here, we study a surprising stimulus dependence of the responses of macaque On (but not Off) parasol retinal ganglion cells: these cells respond nonlinearly to spatial structure in some stimuli but near linearly to spatial structure in others, including natural inputs. We show that these differences in the linearity of the integration of spatial inputs can be explained by a shift in the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs that originates at least partially from adaptation in the cone photoreceptors. More generally, this highlights how subtle asymmetries in signaling - here in the rod signals - can qualitatively alter circuit computation.","Neural circuits are constructed from nonlinear building blocks, and not surprisingly overall circuit behavior is often strongly nonlinear.

"Dopamine-dependent long-term plasticity is believed to be a cellular mechanism underlying reinforcement learning. In response to reward and reward-predicting cues, phasic dopamine activity potentiates the efficacy of corticostriatal synapses on spiny projection neurons (SPNs). Since phasic dopamine activity also encodes other behavioural variables, it is unclear how postsynaptic neurons identify which dopamine event is to induce long-term plasticity. Additionally, it is unknown how phasic dopamine released from arborised axons can potentiate targeted striatal synapses through volume transmission. To examine these questions we manipulated striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) and dopamine neurons independently in two distinct in vivo paradigms. We report that long-term potentiation (LTP) at corticostriatal synapses with SPNs is dependent on the coincidence of serotonergic modulation with phasic dopamine activation, critically accompanied by SPN depolarisation. Thus, serotonergic cues define the time window for phasic dopamine to induce plasticity, while depolarisation of SPNs constrains the synapses eligible for plasticity.","Dopamine-dependent long-term plasticity is believed to be a cellular mechanism underlying reinforcement learning.

"Patterned coordination of network activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is important for fear expression. Neuromodulatory systems play an essential role in regulating changes between behavioral states, however the mechanisms underlying this neuromodulatory control of transitions between brain and behavioral states remain largely unknown. We show that chemogenetic Gq activation and α1 adrenoreceptor activation in mouse BLA parvalbumin (PV) interneurons induces a previously undescribed, stereotyped phasic bursting in PV neurons and time-locked synchronized bursts of inhibitory postsynaptic currents and phasic firing in BLA principal neurons. This Gq-coupled receptor activation in PV neurons suppresses gamma oscillations in vivo and in an ex vivo slice model, and increases fear memory recall, which is consistent with BLA gamma suppression during conditioned fear expression. Notably, stress-induced cortisol release in PV inhibitory interneurons of the BLA regulates BLA network oscillations and fear memory recall, implying a stress-related modulatory effect.","Patterned coordination of network activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is important for fear expression.

"The development and evolution of mammalian higher cognition are represented by gyrification of the laminar cerebral cortex and astrocyte development, but their mechanisms and interrelationships remain unknown. Here, we show that localized astrogenesis plays an important role in gyri formation in the gyrencephalic cerebral cortex. In functional genetic experiments, we show that reducing astrocyte number prevents gyri formation in the ferret cortex, while increasing astrocyte number in mice, which do not have cortical folds, can induce gyrus-like protrusions. Morphometric analyses demonstrate that the vertical expansion of deep pallial regions achieved by localized astrogenesis is crucial for gyri formation. Furthermore, our findings suggest that localized hypoxia, rather than a positive feedback loop of FGF signaling, is an important mechanism underlying cortical folding in gyrencephalic mammalian brains. Our findings reveal both the cellular mechanisms and the mechanical principle of gyrification in the mammalian brain.","The development and evolution of mammalian higher cognition are represented by gyrification of the laminar cerebral cortex and astrocyte development, but their mechanisms and interrelationships remain unknown.

"The mechanisms underlying the transition from acute to chronic pain are unclear but may involve the persistence or strengthening of pain memories acquired in part through associative learning. Contextual cues, which comprise the environment in which events occur, were recently described as a critical regulator of pain memory; both male rodents and humans exhibit increased pain sensitivity in environments recently associated with a single painful experience. It is unknown, however, how repeated exposure to an acute painful unconditioned stimulus in a distinct context modifies pain sensitivity or the expectation of pain in that environment. To answer this question, we conditioned mice to associate distinct contexts with either repeated administration of a mild visceral pain stimulus (intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid) or vehicle injection over the course of 3 days. On the final day of experiments, animals received either an acid injection or vehicle injection prior to being placed into both contexts. In this way, contextual control of pain sensitivity and pain expectation could be tested respectively. When re-exposed to the noxious stimulus in a familiar environment, both male and female mice exhibited context-dependent conditioned analgesia, a phenomenon mediated by dopamine signaling. However, when expecting the presentation of a painful stimulus in a given context, males exhibited conditioned hypersensitivity whereas females exhibited endogenous opioid-mediated conditioned analgesia. These results are evidence that pain perception and engagement of endogenous opioid systems can be modified through their psychological association with environmental cues. Successful determination of the brain circuits involved in this sexually dimorphic anticipatory response may allow for the manipulation of pain memories, which may contribute to the development of chronic pain states.","The mechanisms underlying the transition from acute to chronic pain are unclear but may involve the persistence or strengthening of pain memories acquired in part through associative learning.

"Perception and cognition require the integration of feedforward sensory information with feedback signals. Using different sized stimuli, we isolate spectral signatures of feedforward and feedback signals, and their effect on communication between layers in primary visual cortex of male macaque monkeys. Small stimuli elicited gamma frequency oscillations predominantly in the superficial layers. These Granger-causally originated in upper layer 4 and lower supragranular layers. Unexpectedly, large stimuli generated strong narrow band gamma oscillatory activity across cortical layers. They Granger-causally arose in layer 5, were conveyed through layer six to superficial layers, and violated existing models of feedback spectral signatures. Equally surprising, with large stimuli, alpha band oscillatory activity arose predominantly in granular and supragranular layers and communicated in a feedforward direction. Thus, oscillations in specific frequency bands are dynamically modulated to serve feedback and feedforward communication and are not restricted to specific cortical layers in V1.","Perception and cognition require the integration of feedforward sensory information with feedback signals.

"Mechanosensation - by which mechanical stimuli are converted into a neuronal signal - is the basis for the sensory systems of hearing, balance, and touch. Mechanosensation is unmatched in speed and its diverse range of sensitivities, reaching its highest temporal limits with the sense of hearing; however, hair cells (HCs) and the auditory nerve (AN) serve as obligatory bottlenecks for sounds to engage the brain. Like other sensory neurons, auditory neurons use the canonical pathway for neurotransmission and millisecond-duration action potentials (APs). How the auditory system utilizes the relatively slow transmission mechanisms to achieve ultrafast speed, and high audio-frequency hearing remains an enigma. Here, we address this paradox and report that the mouse, and chinchilla, AN are mechanically sensitive, and minute mechanical displacement profoundly affects its response properties. Sound-mimicking sinusoidal mechanical and electrical current stimuli affect phase-locked responses. In a phase-dependent manner, the two stimuli can also evoke suppressive responses. We propose that mechanical sensitivity interacts with synaptic responses to shape responses in the AN, including frequency tuning and temporal phase locking. Combining neurotransmission and mechanical sensation to control spike patterns gives the mammalian AN a secondary receptor role, an emerging theme in primary neuronal functions.","Mechanosensation - by which mechanical stimuli are converted into a neuronal signal - is the basis for the sensory systems of hearing, balance, and touch.
