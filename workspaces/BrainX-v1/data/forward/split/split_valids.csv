Neural correlates of visual object recognition in rats.,"Invariant object recognition-the ability to recognize objects across size, rotation, or context-is fundamental for making sense of a dynamic visual world. Though traditionally studied in primates, emerging evidence suggests rodents recognize objects across a range of identity-preserving transformations. We demonstrate that rats robustly perform visual object recognition and explore a neural pathway that may underlie this capacity by developing a pipeline from high-throughput behavior training to cellular resolution imaging in awake, head-fixed animals. Leveraging our optical approach, we systematically profile neurons in primary and higher-order visual areas and their spatial organization. We find that rat visual cortex exhibits several features similar to those observed in the primate ventral stream but also marked deviations, suggesting species-specific differences in how brains solve visual object recognition. This work reinforces the sophisticated visual abilities of rats and offers the technical foundation to use them as a powerful model for mechanistic perception.",10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115461,"['Juliana Y Rhee', 'César Echavarría', 'Edward Soucy', 'Joel Greenwood', 'Javier A Masís', 'David D Cox']",2025-Mar,Cell reports,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']","Invariant object recognition-the ability to recognize objects across size, rotation, or context-is fundamental for making sense of a dynamic visual world.

The value of initiating a pursuit in temporal decision-making.,"Reward-rate maximization is a prominent normative principle in behavioral ecology, neuroscience, economics, and AI. Here, we identify, compare, and analyze equations to maximize reward rate when assessing whether to initiate a pursuit. In deriving expressions for the value of a pursuit, we show that time's cost consists of both apportionment and opportunity cost. Reformulating value as a discounting function, we show precisely how a reward-rate-optimal agent's discounting function (1) combines hyperbolic and linear components reflecting apportionment and opportunity costs, and (2) is dependent not only on the considered pursuit's properties but also on time spent and rewards obtained outside the pursuit. This analysis reveals how purported signs of suboptimal behavior (hyperbolic discounting, and the Delay, Magnitude, and Sign effects) are in fact consistent with reward-rate maximization. To better account for observed decision-making errors in humans and animals, we then analyze the impact of misestimating reward-rate-maximizing parameters and find that suboptimal decisions likely stem from errors in assessing time's apportionment-specifically, underweighting time spent outside versus inside a pursuit-which we term the 'Malapportionment Hypothesis'. This understanding of the true pattern of temporal decision-making errors is essential to deducing the learning algorithms and representational architectures actually used by humans and animals.",10.7554/eLife.99957,"['Elissa Sutlief', 'Charlie Walters', 'Tanya Marton', 'Marshall G Hussain Shuler']",2025-Mar,eLife,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']","Reward-rate maximization is a prominent normative principle in behavioral ecology, neuroscience, economics, and AI.","Here, we identify, compare, and analyze equations to maximize reward rate when assessing whether to initiate a pursuit.

Layer 6 corticocortical neurons are a major route for intra- and interhemispheric feedback.,"The neocortex comprises anatomically discrete yet interconnected areas that are symmetrically located across the two hemispheres. Determining the logic of these macrocircuits is necessary for understanding high level brain function. Here in mice, we have mapped the areal and laminar organization of the ipsi- and contralateral cortical projection onto the primary visual, somatosensory, and motor cortices. We find that although the ipsilateral hemisphere is the primary source of cortical input, there is substantial contralateral symmetry regarding the relative contribution and areal identity of input. Laminar analysis of these input areas show that excitatory Layer 6 corticocortical cells (L6 CCs) are a major projection pathway within and between the two hemispheres. Analysis of the relative contribution of inputs from supra- (feedforward) and infragranular (feedback) layers reveals that contra-hemispheric projections reflect a dominant feedback organization compared to their ipsi-cortical counterpart. The magnitude of the interhemispheric difference in hierarchy was largest for sensory and motor projection areas compared to frontal, medial, or lateral brain areas due to a proportional increase in input from L6 neurons. L6 CCs therefore not only mediate long-range cortical communication but also reflect its inherent feedback organization.",10.7554/eLife.100478,"['Simon Weiler', 'Manuel Teichert', 'Troy W Margrie']",2025-Mar,eLife,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",The neocortex comprises anatomically discrete yet interconnected areas that are symmetrically located across the two hemispheres.

Electrophysiology and morphology of human cortical supragranular pyramidal cells in a wide age range.,"The basic excitatory neurons of the cerebral cortex, the pyramidal cells, are the most important signal integrators for the local circuit. They have quite characteristic morphological and electrophysiological properties that are known to be largely constant with age in the young and adult cortex. However, the brain undergoes several dynamic changes throughout life, such as in the phases of early development and cognitive decline in the aging brain. We set out to search for intrinsic cellular changes in supragranular pyramidal cells across a broad age range: from birth to 85 y of age and we found differences in several biophysical properties between defined age groups. During the first year of life, subthreshold and suprathreshold electrophysiological properties changed in a way that shows that pyramidal cells become less excitable with maturation, but also become temporarily more precise. According to our findings, the morphological features of the three-dimensional reconstructions from different life stages showed consistent morphological properties and systematic dendritic spine analysis of an infantile and an old pyramidal cell showed clear significant differences in the distribution of spine shapes. Overall, the changes that occur during development and aging may have lasting effects on the properties of pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex. Understanding these changes is important to unravel the complex mechanisms underlying brain development, cognition, and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.",10.7554/eLife.100390,"['Pál Barzó', 'Ildikó Szöts', 'Martin Tóth', 'Éva Adrienn Csajbók', 'Gábor Molnár', 'Gábor Tamás']",2025-Mar,eLife,"['Humans', 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation', 'Male', 'Female', 'Adult', 'Electroencephalography', 'Motor Cortex', 'Young Adult', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Neural Pathways', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Humans', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Folate Receptor 1', 'Aged', 'Brain', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Middle Aged', 'Humans', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Aged', 'Gait Disorders, Neurologic', 'Middle Aged', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Antiparkinson Agents', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Humans', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Adult', 'Young Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Aging', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Electrophysiological Phenomena', 'Female', 'Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Mice', 'Neurotensin', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Hypothermia, Induced', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Male', 'Peptides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']","The basic excitatory neurons of the cerebral cortex, the pyramidal cells, are the most important signal integrators for the local circuit.

"A peptide-neurotensin conjugate that crosses the blood-brain barrier induces pharmacological hypothermia associated with anticonvulsant, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory properties following status epilepticus in mice.","Preclinical and clinical studies show that mild to moderate hypothermia is neuroprotective in sudden cardiac arrest, ischemic stroke, perinatal hypoxia/ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and seizures. Induction of hypothermia largely involves physical cooling therapies, which induce several clinical complications, while some molecules have shown to be efficient in pharmacologically induced hypothermia (PIH). Neurotensin (NT), a 13 amino acid neuropeptide that regulates body temperature, interacts with various receptors to mediate its peripheral and central effects. NT induces PIH when administered intracerebrally. However, these effects are not observed if NT is administered peripherally, due to its rapid degradation and poor passage of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We conjugated NT to peptides that bind the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) to generate 'vectorized' forms of NT with enhanced BBB permeability. We evaluated their effects in epileptic conditions following peripheral administration. One of these conjugates, VH-N412, displayed improved stability, binding potential to both the LDLR and NTSR-1, rodent/human cross-reactivity and improved brain distribution. In a mouse model of kainate (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE), VH-N412 elicited rapid hypothermia associated with anticonvulsant effects, potent neuroprotection, and reduced hippocampal inflammation. VH-N412 also reduced sprouting of the dentate gyrus mossy fibers and preserved learning and memory skills in the treated mice. In cultured hippocampal neurons, VH-N412 displayed temperature-independent neuroprotective properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the successful treatment of SE with PIH. In all, our results show that vectorized NT may elicit different neuroprotection mechanisms mediated by hypothermia and/or by intrinsic neuroprotective properties.",10.7554/eLife.100527,"['Lotfi Ferhat', 'Rabia Soussi', 'Maxime Masse', 'Grigorios Kyriatzis', 'Stéphane Girard', 'Fanny Gassiot', 'Nicolas Gaudin', 'Mathieu Laurencin', 'Anne Bernard', 'Angélique Bôle', 'Géraldine Ferracci', 'Maria Smirnova', 'François Roman', 'Vincent Dive', 'Salvatore Cisternino', 'Jamal Temsamani', 'Marion David', 'Pascaline Lécorché', 'Guillaume Jacquot', 'Michel Khrestchatisky']",2025-Mar,eLife,"['Humans', 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation', 'Male', 'Female', 'Adult', 'Electroencephalography', 'Motor Cortex', 'Young Adult', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Neural Pathways', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Humans', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Folate Receptor 1', 'Aged', 'Brain', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Middle Aged', 'Humans', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Aged', 'Gait Disorders, Neurologic', 'Middle Aged', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Antiparkinson Agents', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Humans', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Adult', 'Young Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Aging', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Electrophysiological Phenomena', 'Female', 'Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Mice', 'Neurotensin', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Hypothermia, Induced', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Male', 'Peptides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']","Preclinical and clinical studies show that mild to moderate hypothermia is neuroprotective in sudden cardiac arrest, ischemic stroke, perinatal hypoxia/ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and seizures.
