Improvement in multiple cognitive domains via combined revascularization by 6 months' follow-up: a new potential surgical indication in moyamoya disease.,"Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a cerebrovascular condition characterized by progressive stenosis of the main branches of the cerebral artery. Patients with MMD are prone to cognitive decline due to chronic hypoperfusion. Whether revascularization surgery can reverse cognitive dysfunction by improving cerebral blood flow perfusion and what types and levels of cognitive dysfunction can benefit most from the surgery remain unclear. Between July 31, 2022, and May 15, 2024, a total of 155 patients were prospectively enrolled in this trial and underwent combined or indirect revascularization with an average 6-month follow-up. Eleven types of cognitive domains were tested. Subgroup analysis was used to compare the postoperative benefits of different surgical procedures and preoperative cognitive levels. Choice reaction time (adjusted p = 0.032), verbal working memory (adjusted p = 0.006), mental rotation (adjusted p = 0.002), complex subtraction (adjusted p < 0.001), and word memory (adjusted p < 0.001) improved significantly after surgery. Combined revascularization led to improvement in more cognitive domains (choice reaction time, p < 0.001; mental rotation, p < 0.001; word memory, p < 0.001; executive inhibition in the same direction, p = 0.016; complex subtraction, p = 0.001; and verbal working memory in reverse order, p = 0.001) than indirect revascularization (word memory, p = 0.023; and complex subtraction, p = 0.007). Revascularization can selectively reverse cognitive dysfunction by improving cerebral blood flow perfusion in adults with MMD. Combined revascularization may allow more definite hemodynamic improvement than indirect revascularization, leading to more frequent and greater potential improvement in more cognitive domains; however, more studies are needed to confirm this. A population with lower preoperative cognition and good postoperative collateral formation may benefit more from the surgery.",10.3171/2024.11.JNS241932,"['Ziqi Liu', 'Xiaokuan Hao', 'Chaoran Shen', 'Shihao He', 'Jing Gu', 'Junze Zhang', 'Yanru Wang', 'Xilong Wang', 'Zhenyu Zhou', 'Ning Ma', 'Ran Duan', 'Weitao Jin', 'Xin Lou', 'Xinlin Zhou', 'Tao Yu', 'Yongbo Yang', 'Rong Wang']",2025-Mar,Journal of neurosurgery,"['Humans', 'HeLa Cells', 'Gases', 'Acoustics', 'Micromanipulation', 'Animals', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices']"
"Mapping, classification, and surgical strategy for vertebral artery variation in posterior atlantoaxial joint release, distraction, and fusion surgery for basilar invagination and atlantoaxial instability.","The objective of this study was to develop a vertebral artery (VA) classification system that improves risk assessment using a 2D map of the VA position at the craniovertebral junction (CVJ), and to outline surgical strategies for managing anomalous VAs during the posterior atlantoaxial joint release, distraction, and fusion technique in the treatment of basilar invagination (BI) and atlantoaxial instability (AAI). In this retrospective study, 125 patients (mean age 44.1 years) with BI and AAI who underwent surgery between January 2019 and April 2021 using the atlantoaxial joint release, distraction, and fusion technique were included. A distribution map was used to better delineate the course of VA and its relationship with the atlantoaxial facet. Under the concept of the current technique, the morphology of VA was reclassified according to the severity of anomaly and surgical risk. Intraoperative risks were graded, and different strategies for handling anomalous vessels were discussed based on the classification. A system of mapping VA distribution was proposed and showed that up to 27% of VAs coursed posterior to the atlantoaxial facet joint, which evidently hampered the facet joint release and manipulation. The VAs coursed in the inferomedial field less frequently. Based on the surgical risk of the posterior atlantoaxial joint release, distraction, and fusion technique, the morphology of VA was classified into 5 types. Additionally, patients were categorized into low-risk, medium-risk, high-risk, and contraindicated groups, according to bilateral VA patterns and institutional surgical experience. Different intraoperative strategies for handling anomalous vessels were introduced and discussed. Intragenic VA injury occurred in 2 of 125 patients (1.6%). The authors introduced a novel method of describing the VA course at the CVJ, called VA mapping, and a VA classification system was proposed to enhance the understanding of risk evaluation in the context of atlantoaxial joint release, distraction, and fusion. A risk stratification system was determined based on bilateral VA patterns, and specific surgical strategies were formulated. The overall iatrogenic VA injury rate was 1.6%, indicating the proposed classification and surgical protocol are reliable and reproducible for minimizing the risk of intraoperative VA injury.",10.3171/2024.12.SPINE24185,"['Yue-Qi Du', 'Wanru Duan', 'Mao-Yang Qi', 'Jia-Lu Wang', 'Bo-Yan Zhang', 'Hong-Feng Meng', 'Tian-Yu Jin', 'Can Zhang', 'Peng-Hao Liu', 'Jian Guan', 'Feng-Zeng Jian', 'Zan Chen']",2025-Mar,Journal of neurosurgery.

"Indications and outcomes of the extended endoscopic endonasal approach for the removal of ""unconventional"" suprasellar pituitary neuroendocrine tumors.","Pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) rarely harbor ""unconventional"" inner features such as wide intracranial extension, fibrous consistency, irregular shape, vessel encasement, and subarachnoid space invasion that increase surgical complexity, as they are not suitable for the standard transsphenoidal route. Among this subset of difficult adenomas, PitNETs harboring an unconventional suprasellar extension present peculiar surgical considerations and challenges. Herein, the authors present an international multicentric study, intending to analyze the indications and outcomes of the endoscopic endonasal transtuberculum-transplanum approach (ETTA) for the removal of these so-called unconventional PitNETs in a large cohort of patients. PitNETs removed via an endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) between January 2000 and December 2023 at 4 primary referral centers were retrospectively reviewed. Tumors removed via the ETTA and harboring one or more of the following unconventional suprasellar features, regardless of size and/or cavernous sinus invasion, were included in the study: irregular shape, vessel encasement, subarachnoid invasion at the supradiaphragmatic space, and firm or fibrous consistency. Clinical, radiological, surgical findings, and outcomes were reviewed. Of a total of 5138 patients with PitNETs, 257 patients underwent an ETTA (5%). Nonfunctioning PitNETs were the most common (65.4%). The most common presenting symptoms were visual field restriction (64.6%), decreased visual acuity (51%), anterior pituitary deficiency (44.8%), and endocrine hyperproduction syndromes (20.6%). All PitNETs harbored prominent suprasellar extension: 33.1% were giant and 30.7% were fibrous; the majority were multilobular (43.6%) and Knosp grade ≥ 3 (54.1%). Overall, 51.8% of patients had undergone previous treatment. The gross-total resection (GTR) rate was 49.8%. Visual field and visual acuity improved in 67.5% and 82.4% of cases, respectively. The postoperative complication rate was 19.1%. Previous treatment, vessel encasement, and Knosp grade ≥ 3 were independent risk factors affecting extent of resection. A suprasellar tumor remnant was the only significant risk factor for vascular complications, and tumor GTR the only protecting factor. This is the largest series in the literature describing indications and outcome expectations of the ETTA for the removal of unconventional suprasellar PitNETs. Tumor size, shape, and consistency did not represent a limitation to favorable surgical outcomes. The difficulty in achieving total removal of unconventional PitNETs, especially in the presence of vessel encasement and recurrent lesions, should raise the awareness of the increased risk of suprasellar tumor remnant apoplexy and arterial vasospasm, particularly in tumors with subarachnoid invasion.",10.3171/2024.11.JNS242484,"['Domenico Solari', ""Elena d'Avella"", 'Garni Barkhoudarian', 'Matteo Zoli', 'Stephanie Cheok', 'Ilaria Bove', 'Gianluca Lorenzo Fabozzi', 'Gabriel Zada', 'Diego Mazzatenta', 'Daniel F Kelly', 'Paolo Cappabianca', 'Luigi Maria Cavallo']",2025-Mar,Journal of neurosurgery,"['Humans', 'HeLa Cells', 'Gases', 'Acoustics', 'Micromanipulation', 'Animals', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices']"
The mood stabilizers lithium and valproate disrupt hepatic and intestinal farnesoid X receptor signalling and increase bile synthesis in the rat.,"The mood stabilizers lithium and valproate are psychotropic medications widely used in clinical practice. Despite their proven benefits, many individuals stop their treatment due to the adverse effects. Chronic diarrhoea is a common reason for discontinuation of these drugs; however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Excessive loss of bile acids (BA) into the colon is a major cause of diarrhoea. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of these drugs on BA metabolism. We measured BA levels in the liver, plasma and faeces of Sprague-Dawley rats treated with lithium or valproate for 4 weeks. Next, we analysed changes in the expression of genes and proteins involved in BA production and enterohepatic circulation. Lithium and valproate markedly increased BA levels across all body sites. This was accompanied by the up-regulation of hepatic cytochrome P450 7A1 (Cyp7a1), the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo BA synthesis. Under normal conditions, elevated levels of BAs suppress Cyp7a1 via activation of the hepatic farnesoid X receptor (Fxr)/small heterodimer partner (Shp) and intestinal Fxr/fibroblast growth factor 19 (Fgf19) pathways. This signalling was disrupted in both treatment groups. The Fxr-mediated responses in the expression of Ntcp, Asbt, Ilbp and Ostα/β bile transporters were also affected by treatment. In conclusion, lithium and valproate disrupted farnesoid X receptor signalling at the hepatic and intestinal levels, inducing sustained overproduction of bile in rats. These findings provide novel insights into the peripheral effects of these drugs. Given that similar changes in bile circuits underlie the pathophysiology of primary BA diarrhoea in humans, this study suggests a potential mechanism behind chronic diarrhoea in patients undergoing lithium or valproate therapy.",10.1113/EP092451,"['Sofia Cussotto', 'Anna V Golubeva', 'Alvaro Lopez Gallardo', 'Thomaz F S Bastiaanssen', 'Alexander V Zhdanov', 'Gerard M Moloney', 'Caitriona Scaife', 'Jane A English', 'Susan A Joyce', 'Timothy G Dinan', 'John F Cryan']",2025-Mar,Experimental physiology,"['Humans', 'HeLa Cells', 'Gases', 'Acoustics', 'Micromanipulation', 'Animals', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices']"
Chemical genomics informs antibiotic and essential gene function in Acinetobacter baumannii.,"The Gram-negative pathogen, Acinetobacter baumannii, poses a serious threat to human health due to its role in nosocomial infections that are resistant to treatment with current antibiotics. Despite this, our understanding of fundamental A. baumannii biology remains limited, as many essential genes have not been experimentally characterized. These essential genes are critical for bacterial survival and, thus, represent promising targets for drug discovery. Here, we systematically probe the function of essential genes by screening a CRISPR interference knockdown library against a diverse panel of chemical inhibitors, including antibiotics. We find that most essential genes show chemical-gene interactions, allowing insights into both inhibitor and gene function. For instance, knockdown of lipooligosaccharide (LOS) transport genes increased sensitivity to a broad range of chemicals. Cells with defective LOS transport showed cell envelope hyper-permeability that was dependent on continued LOS synthesis. Using phenotypes across our chemical-gene interaction dataset, we constructed an essential gene network linking poorly understood genes to well-characterized genes in cell division and other processes. Finally, our phenotype-structure analysis identified structurally related antibiotics with distinct cellular impacts and suggested potential targets for underexplored inhibitors. This study advances our understanding of essential gene and inhibitor function, providing a valuable resource for mechanistic studies, therapeutic strategies, and future key targets for antibiotic development.",10.1371/journal.pgen.1011642,"['Jennifer Suzanne Tran', 'Ryan David Ward', 'Rubén Iruegas-López', 'Ingo Ebersberger', 'Jason Matthew Peters']",2025-Mar,PLoS genetics,"['Humans', 'HeLa Cells', 'Gases', 'Acoustics', 'Micromanipulation', 'Animals', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices']"
1953-2023. Seventy Years of the Nerve Growth Factor: A Potential Novel Treatment in Neurological Diseases?,"Rita Levi-Montalcini's 1953 discovery of nerve growth factor (NGF) in mouse sarcoma tumors marked a groundbreaking moment in neuroscience. NGF, a key signaling molecule, became the first identified neurotrophic factor, influencing the growth, differentiation, and survival of neurons in both peripheral and central nervous systems. NGF and related neurotrophic factors hold therapeutic potential for various neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, neuropathies, traumatic brain injuries, and stroke. However, despite promising in vitro studies and animal models findings, NGF efficacy in patients remains unproven. Indeed, its use as a therapeutic agent faces challenges in delivery and clinical translation. This review delves into these challenges, exploring ongoing research on refined delivery methods, dosages, and safety profiles. Innovative strategies, including molecular mimicking, combination therapies, gene therapy, and coupling with neuromodulation techniques like transcranial magnetic stimulation and vagal nerve stimulation, are discussed. Incorporating nerve growth factor (NGF) into a comprehensive strategy may prove beneficial, particularly in non-neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke, trauma, and neuropathies. In these instances, NGF holds promise for promoting tissue regeneration and repair. Challenges persist in addressing the complexity of neurodegenerative pathologies for a combined therapeutic approach.",10.14336/AD.2024.0573,"['Davide Norata', 'Fioravante Capone', 'Francesco Motolese', 'Massimo Marano', 'Mariagrazia Rossi', 'Rosalinda Calandrelli', 'Marta Sacchetti', 'Flavio Mantelli', 'Vincenzo Di Lazzaro', 'Fabio Pilato']",2025-Mar,Aging and disease,"['Humans', 'HeLa Cells', 'Gases', 'Acoustics', 'Micromanipulation', 'Animals', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices']"
Association Between Dementia and Optical Coherence Tomography Scan Quality.,"It is generally assumed that dementia affects the quality of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans. However, the magnitude of this effect and its independence from other factors require further clarification. In this cross-sectional study, our aim was to evaluate the association between cognitive impairment and OCT scan quality, adjusting for key confounders, in a multiethnic cohort. 541 participants aged 50 years or older were recruited from memory clinics and the community at the National University Hospital and St. Luke's Hospital, Singapore. They were then stratified into three groups: no cognitive impairment (NCI, n=112), cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND, n=235), and dementia (n=194); OCT scan quality was subsequently assessed based on the presence and severity of artifacts. We found that dementia patients were nearly three times more likely to produce poor-quality OCT scans compared to NCI participants (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=2.90; 95% CI, 1.24-6.80). Lower cognitive scores, including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (OR=0.92; 95% CI, 0.88-0.96), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (OR=0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.94), and higher Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores (OR=2.11; 95% CI, 1.43-3.10), were also independently associated with poor scan quality. In conclusion, cognitive impairment, particularly dementia, substantially increases the likelihood of poor-quality OCT scans, even after accounting for key demographic and clinical factors. Hence, strategies tailored to improve imaging in this population are essential for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and patient care.",10.14336/AD.2024.1744,"['Reuben Jyong Kiat Foo', 'Damon Wong', 'Nur Fidyana Binte Abdul Gani', 'Bingyao Tan', 'Munirah Binte Ismail', 'Gerhard Garhöfer', 'Laetitia Hinterhuber', 'Narayanaswamy Venketasubramanian', 'Christopher Li-Hsian Chen', 'Leopold Schmetterer', 'Jacqueline Chua']",2025-Mar,Aging and disease,"['Humans', 'HeLa Cells', 'Gases', 'Acoustics', 'Micromanipulation', 'Animals', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices']"
μSonic-hand: Biomedical micromanipulation driven by acoustic gas-liquid-solid interactions.,"Micromanipulation is crucial for operating and analyzing microobjects in advanced biomedical applications. However, safe, low-cost, multifunctional micromanipulation for operating bio-objects across scales and modalities remains inaccessible. Here, we propose a versatile micromanipulation method driven by acoustic gas-liquid-solid interactions, named μSonic-hand. The bubble contained at the end of a micropipette and the surrounding liquid form a gas-liquid multiphase system susceptible to acoustic waves. Driven by a piezoelectric transducer, the oscillating gas-liquid interface induces acoustic microstreaming, markedly increasing the mass transfer efficiency. It enables multiple liquid micromanipulations, including mixing, dispersion, enhancing cell membrane permeability, and harvesting selected cells. Furthermore, a controllable three-dimensional axisymmetric vortex in an open environment overcomes the constraints of microfluidic chip, enabling stable trapping, rapid transportation, and multidirectional rotation of HeLa cells, embryos, and other bio-objects ranging from micrometers to millimeters. A variety of applications demonstrate that the μSonic-hand, with its wide-range capabilities, inherent biocompatibility, and extremely low cost could remarkably advance biomedical science.",10.1126/sciadv.ads8167,"['Xiaoming Liu', 'Yuyang Li', 'Fengyu Liu', 'Qing Shi', 'Lixin Dong', 'Qiang Huang', 'Tatsuo Arai', 'Toshio Fukuda']",2025-Mar,Science advances,"['Humans', 'HeLa Cells', 'Gases', 'Acoustics', 'Micromanipulation', 'Animals', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices']"

Neural correlates of visual object recognition in rats.,"Invariant object recognition-the ability to recognize objects across size, rotation, or context-is fundamental for making sense of a dynamic visual world. Though traditionally studied in primates, emerging evidence suggests rodents recognize objects across a range of identity-preserving transformations. We demonstrate that rats robustly perform visual object recognition and explore a neural pathway that may underlie this capacity by developing a pipeline from high-throughput behavior training to cellular resolution imaging in awake, head-fixed animals. Leveraging our optical approach, we systematically profile neurons in primary and higher-order visual areas and their spatial organization. We find that rat visual cortex exhibits several features similar to those observed in the primate ventral stream but also marked deviations, suggesting species-specific differences in how brains solve visual object recognition. This work reinforces the sophisticated visual abilities of rats and offers the technical foundation to use them as a powerful model for mechanistic perception.",10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115461,"['Juliana Y Rhee', 'César Echavarría', 'Edward Soucy', 'Joel Greenwood', 'Javier A Masís', 'David D Cox']",2025-Mar,Cell reports,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
Monocytic TLR4 expression and activation in schizophrenia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The role of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in schizophrenia remains unclear, with studies reporting conflicting results on its expression and activation in persons with schizophrenia (PwSCZ). This systematic review/meta-analysis compared basal monocytic TLR4 expression, as well as its activation pattern between PwSCZ and healthy controls (HCs). This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021273858) and adhered to the PRISMA guidelines. A systematic search was conducted through MEDLINE (via PubMed), Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to December 12, 2023. Quantitative syntheses were conducted for (a) basal monocytic TLR4 density, (b) basal percentage of TLR4+ monocytes, and (c) basal TLR4 gene expression. Effect sizes were computed using Hedges' g for mean differences. Random-effect models with restricted maximum-likelihood estimation were used, and subgrouping was conducted based on antipsychotic status. The studies' risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tool. Eleven studies (473 PwSCZ, 416 HCs) were included. Pooled analysis revealed a nonsignificant trend toward increased basal monocytic TLR4 density in PwSCZ (Hedges' g = 0.317 [95% CI: -0.060, 0.694], τ2 = 0.127, I2 = 68.91%). The difference became significant after sensitivity analysis and excluding one study (Hedges' g = 0.469 [0.195,0.742], p = 0.001). No significant difference was found between the groups in terms of TLR4+ monocytes percentage (Hedges' g = 0.235 [-0.245, 0.715], τ2 = 0.31, I2 = 87.30%) or TLR4 gene expression (Hedges' g = 0.179 [-0.502, 0.861], τ2 = 0.29, I2 = 79.04%). According to qualitative synthesis, TLR4 stimulation resulted in reduced monocytic activation in PwSCZ compared to HCs. This study suggested a trend toward an increased basal monocytic TLR4 density in PwSCZ, with no difference in the basal percentage of TLR4+ monocytes or TLR4 gene expression. However, the limited available data underscores the need for future studies.",10.1371/journal.pone.0319171,"['Melika Jameie', 'Sanaz Bordbar', 'Reza Samiee', 'Mobina Amanollahi', 'Mehdi Azizmohammad Looha', 'Mir Sajjad Aleyasin', 'Mohammad Reza Abdol Homayuni', 'Mehrdad Mozafar', 'Seyed Behnamedin Jameie', 'Shahin Akhondzadeh']",nan,PloS one,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
Delivering systems-level change to improve post-diagnostic dementia support: Qualitative findings from the PriDem study.,"There are 900,000 people with dementia in England and Wales. Existing models of post-diagnostic support are unsustainable and unaffordable. The PriDem programme developed a new model of primary care-based dementia care, whereby a Clinical Dementia Lead (CDL) would facilitate systems-level change. To assess barriers and facilitators to implementation of the PriDem intervention. 7 general practices participated in a qualitative process evaluation, as part of the mixed-methods feasibility and implementation study. Practices were located within 4 Primary Care Networks in the North East and South East of England. 26 healthcare professionals, 14 people with dementia and 16 carers linked to participating general practices participated in semi-structured individual and small group interviews. Additional qualitative data were generated through nonparticipant observations and researcher fieldnotes from CDL intervention supervision sessions. Data were analysed using abductive codebook thematic analysis informed by Normalisation Process Theory (NPT). Six themes were generated: 1) The rocky ground of primary care; 2) The power of people; 3) Tension between adaptability and fidelity; 4) Challenging the status quo: reimagining care planning; 5) One size doesn't fit all; 6) Positive effects on people and systems: towards sustainability. Through the lens of NPT we can understand the contextual challenges facing primary care, the mechanisms (e.g., work undertaken by individuals) to overcome those challenges, as well as the potential outcomes of such an approach, in terms of longer-term sustainability of changes made. Despite the pressures facing primary care within England and Wales, meaningful change can be made to practice in the care of people with dementia. The presence of motivated and engaged staff are critical to implementation, as is ensuring understanding of complex interventions, so that fidelity can be maintained. People with dementia and carers benefitted from improved care systems.

The impact of self-isolation on psychological wellbeing in adults and how to reduce it: A systematic review.,"To synthesise evidence on the impact of self-isolation at home on the psychological and emotional wellbeing of adults in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022378140). We searched Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Embase, and grey literature. Wellbeing included adverse mental health outcomes and adaptive wellbeing. We followed PRISMA and synthesis without meta-analysis (SWiM) guidelines. We extracted data on the impact of self-isolation on wellbeing, and factors associated with and interventions targeting wellbeing during self-isolation. Thirty-six studies were included. The mode quality rating was 'high-risk'. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were most investigated. Evidence for an impact of self-isolation on wellbeing was often inconsistent in quantitative studies, although qualitative studies consistently reported a negative impact. People with pre-existing mental and physical health needs reported increased symptoms of mental ill health during self-isolation. Studies reported modifiable stressors that have been reported in previous infectious disease contexts, such as inadequate support, poor coping strategies, inadequate and conflicting information, and highlighted the importance of regular contact from trusted healthcare professionals. Interventions targeting psychological wellbeing were rare and evaluative studies of these had high or very high risk of bias. When implementing self-isolation directives, public health officials should prioritise support for individuals who have pre-existing mental or physical health needs, lack support, or who are facing significant life stressors. Focus should be directed toward interventions that address loneliness, worries, and misinformation, whilst monitoring and identifying individuals in need of additional support.",10.1371/journal.pone.0310851,"['Alex F Martin', 'Louise E Smith', 'Samantha K Brooks', 'Madeline V Stein', 'Rachel Davies', 'Richard Amlôt', 'Neil Greenberg', 'Gideon James Rubin']",nan,PloS one,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
The value of initiating a pursuit in temporal decision-making.,"Reward-rate maximization is a prominent normative principle in behavioral ecology, neuroscience, economics, and AI. Here, we identify, compare, and analyze equations to maximize reward rate when assessing whether to initiate a pursuit. In deriving expressions for the value of a pursuit, we show that time's cost consists of both apportionment and opportunity cost. Reformulating value as a discounting function, we show precisely how a reward-rate-optimal agent's discounting function (1) combines hyperbolic and linear components reflecting apportionment and opportunity costs, and (2) is dependent not only on the considered pursuit's properties but also on time spent and rewards obtained outside the pursuit. This analysis reveals how purported signs of suboptimal behavior (hyperbolic discounting, and the Delay, Magnitude, and Sign effects) are in fact consistent with reward-rate maximization. To better account for observed decision-making errors in humans and animals, we then analyze the impact of misestimating reward-rate-maximizing parameters and find that suboptimal decisions likely stem from errors in assessing time's apportionment-specifically, underweighting time spent outside versus inside a pursuit-which we term the 'Malapportionment Hypothesis'. This understanding of the true pattern of temporal decision-making errors is essential to deducing the learning algorithms and representational architectures actually used by humans and animals.",10.7554/eLife.99957,"['Elissa Sutlief', 'Charlie Walters', 'Tanya Marton', 'Marshall G Hussain Shuler']",2025-Mar,eLife,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
Layer 6 corticocortical neurons are a major route for intra- and interhemispheric feedback.,"The neocortex comprises anatomically discrete yet interconnected areas that are symmetrically located across the two hemispheres. Determining the logic of these macrocircuits is necessary for understanding high level brain function. Here in mice, we have mapped the areal and laminar organization of the ipsi- and contralateral cortical projection onto the primary visual, somatosensory, and motor cortices. We find that although the ipsilateral hemisphere is the primary source of cortical input, there is substantial contralateral symmetry regarding the relative contribution and areal identity of input. Laminar analysis of these input areas show that excitatory Layer 6 corticocortical cells (L6 CCs) are a major projection pathway within and between the two hemispheres. Analysis of the relative contribution of inputs from supra- (feedforward) and infragranular (feedback) layers reveals that contra-hemispheric projections reflect a dominant feedback organization compared to their ipsi-cortical counterpart. The magnitude of the interhemispheric difference in hierarchy was largest for sensory and motor projection areas compared to frontal, medial, or lateral brain areas due to a proportional increase in input from L6 neurons. L6 CCs therefore not only mediate long-range cortical communication but also reflect its inherent feedback organization.",10.7554/eLife.100478,"['Simon Weiler', 'Manuel Teichert', 'Troy W Margrie']",2025-Mar,eLife,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
A Flexible Spatio-Temporal Architecture Design for Artifact Removal in EEG with Arbitrary Channel-Settings.,"Electroencephalography (EEG) data is easily contaminated by various sources, significantly affecting subsequent analyses in neuroscience and clinical applications. Therefore, effective artifact removal is a key step in EEG preprocessing. While current deep learning methods have demonstrated notable efficacy in EEG denoising, single-channel approaches primarily focus on temporal features and neglect inter-channel correlations. Meanwhile, multi-channel methods mainly prioritize spatial features but often overlook the unique temporal dependencies of individual channels. A common limitation of both single-channel and multi-channel methods is their strict requirements on the input channel setting, which restricts their practical applicability. To address these issues, we design a flexible architecture named Artifact removal Spatio-Temporal Integration Network (ASTI-Net), a dual-branch denoising model capable of handling arbitrary EEG channel settings. ASTI-Net utilizes spatio-temporal attention weighting with dual branches that capture inter-channel spatial characteristics and intra-channel temporal dependencies. Its architecture incorporates deformable convolutional operations and channel-wise temporal processing, accommodating varying numbers of EEG channels and enhancing applicability across diverse clinical and research settings. By integrating features from both branches through a fusion reconstruction module, ASTI-Net effectively restores clean multi-channel EEG. Extensive evaluation on two semi-simulated datasets, along with qualitative assessment on real task-state EEG data, validates that ASTI-Net outperforms existing artifact removal methods.",10.1109/JBHI.2025.3555813,"['Yilin Han', 'Aiping Liu', 'Heng Cui', 'Xun Chen']",2025-Mar,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
Imaging of musculoskeletal injury: timing estimation and medico-legal issues.,"Musculoskeletal imaging plays a pivotal role in the evaluation of trauma, with applications spanning medical, forensic, and insurance contexts. Precisely dating musculoskeletal injuries is vital for reconstructing the timeline of events leading to trauma and verifying their accuracy. In forensic medicine, radiologists are frequently called upon by law enforcement and insurance companies to estimate the age of such injuries. This review aims to provide an overview of musculoskeletal imaging findings that can be used in medico-legal issues related to trauma to reach a comprehensive understanding of the causal relationship between the traumatic event and the clinical findings, with a particular focus on assessing causality, timing estimation and post-traumatic injury and impairment. Imaging plays a pivotal role in the precise and comprehensive evaluation of musculoskeletal traumatic injuries, with applications extending from immediate clinical care to legal and insurance considerations. Through various imaging modalities, it is possible to estimate the time elapsed since the injury and assess the impact of any pre-existing conditions. Effective collaboration between the forensic physician and the radiologist is essential to accurately determine the causal link between the injurious event and the resulting damage. This interdisciplinary approach ensures appropriate compensation and addresses the complex forensic aspects involved.",10.1007/s11547-025-01990-4,"['Giuseppe Davide Albano', 'Antonina Argo', 'Stefania Zerbo', 'Carlotta Scavone', 'Francesco Vitale', 'Carmelo Messina', 'Salvatore Gitto', 'Silvia Albano', 'Mauro Midiri', 'Paolo Vitali', 'Francesca Serpi', 'Giuseppe Lo Re', 'Massimo Galia', 'Cristina Cattaneo', 'Luca Maria Sconfienza', 'Domenico Albano']",2025-Mar,La Radiologia medica,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
Time restricted feeding with or without ketosis influences metabolism-related gene expression in a tissue-specific manner in aged rats.,"Many of the ""hallmarks of aging"" involve alterations in cellular and organismal metabolism. One pathway with the potential to impact several traditional markers of impaired function with aging is the PI3K/AKT metabolic pathway. Regulation of this pathway includes many aspects of cellular function, including protein synthesis, proliferation, and survival, as well as many downstream targets, including mTOR and FOXOs. Importantly, this pathway is pivotal to the function of every organ system in the human body. Thus, we investigated the expression of several genes along this pathway in multiple organs, including the brain, liver, and skeletal muscle, in aged subjects that had been on different experimental diets to regulate metabolic function since mid-life. Specifically, rats were fed a control ad lib diet (AL), a time restricted feeding diet (cTRF), or a time restricted feeding diet with ketogenic macronutrients (kTRF) for the majority of their adult lives (from 8 to 25 months). We previously reported that regardless of macronutrient ratio, TRF-fed rats in both macronutrient groups required significantly less training to acquire a biconditional association task than their ad lib fed counterparts. The current experiments expand on this work by quantifying metabolism-related gene expression across tissues and interrogating for potential relationships with cognitive performance. Within the brain, SIRT1 and MAPK8 were reduced in CA3 of kTRF-fed rats. Additionally, IGF1 expression was significantly upregulated in the CA1 of cTRF-fed rats, but this effect was ameliorated in the kTRF fed group. AKT and FOXO1 expression were significantly reduced in kTRF-fed rats within liver. Interestingly, AKT expression within the perirhinal cortex (PER) was higher in kTRF rats with the best cognitive performance, and FOXO1 expression was higher in the CA3 of AL-fed rats correlated with the poorest cognitive performance. Together, these data demonstrate diet- and tissue-specific alterations in metabolism-related gene expression and their correlation with cognitive status.",10.1007/s11357-025-01632-7,"['Sarah Ding', 'Anisha Banerjee', 'Sara N Burke', 'Abbi R Hernandez']",2025-Mar,GeroScience,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"

Immobilization of KR-12 on a Titanium Alloy Surface Using Linking Arms Improves Antimicrobial Activity and Supports Osteoblast Cytocompatibility.,"Implant-associated infections pose significant challenges due to bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Recent research highlights the potential of immobilizing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) onto implants as an alternative to conventional antibiotics for the prevention of bacterial infection. While various AMP immobilization methodologies have been investigated, they lack responsiveness to biological cues. This study proposes an enzyme-responsive antimicrobial coating for orthopedic devices using KR-12, an AMP derived from Cathelicidin LL-37, coupled with the Human Elastin-Like Polypeptide (HELP) as a biomimetic and stimuli-responsive linker, while mimicking the extracellular matrix (ECM). During implantation, these customized interfaces encounter the innate immune response triggering elastase release, which degrades HELP biopolymers, enabling the controlled release of KR-12. After coupling KR-12 with HELP to titanium surfaces, the antimicrobial activity against four pathogenic bacterial strains (",10.1021/acsabm.4c01731,"['Mohadeseh Zare', 'Laura Colomina Alfaro', 'Antonella Bandiera', 'Esra Cansever Mutlu', 'David Grossin', 'Fernando Albericio', 'Sarah A Kuehne', 'Zubair Ahmed', 'Artemis Stamboulis']",2025-Mar,ACS applied bio materials,"['Humans', 'Autism Spectrum Disorder', 'Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation', 'Child', 'Male', 'Female', 'Electroencephalography', 'Nerve Net', 'Brain Waves', 'Brain', 'Connectome', 'Humans', 'Child', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cochlear Implantation', 'Hearing Loss', 'Disease Progression', 'Hearing Aids', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Male', 'Adolescent', 'Bone Conduction']"

Short-term sick leave due to epilepsy in the Swedish Prospective Regional Epilepsy Database and Biobank for Individualized Clinical Treatment (PREDICT).,"Epilepsy is associated with low socioeconomic standing and increases the risk of sick leave. Longer periods resulting in benefit payments are captured by administrative data, but the disease also entails a risk of repeated short sick leave periods, which have so far not been studied or quantified. The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of short sick leave in persons with epilepsy (PWE) and the characteristics of these PWE. A prospective multicenter study, Prospective Regional Epilepsy Database and Biobank for Individualized Clinical Treatment (PREDICT) project, based on medical records and yearly self-report questionnaires in 2020-2023. PWE from five neurology departments who were working, studying, or applying for work were included, and they reported the number of sick leave days the past year in the questionnaires. Socioeconomic data was retrieved from Statistics Sweden. Demographic and clinical factors were compared by chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, or Mann-Whitney U-test. Of the 288 included PWE, 76.4% (n = 220) stated not having stayed at home due to their epilepsy, 13.9% (n = 40) replied 1-5 days, 1.4% (n = 4) 6-10 days, and 8.3% (n = 27) >10 days. More recently diagnosed PWE reported more sick leave days. Short-term sick leave was more prevalent in those with seizures, with medication side effects, and in those with polytherapy. Demographic and socioeconomic factors did not differ between those with or without sick leave days. In the 184 participants who had replied to the questionnaire at the 1 and/or 2 years' follow-up, the distribution did not differ from the baseline report. Most PWE do not have short-term sick leave. Short-term sick leave was mainly seen in those with more difficult-to-treat or newly diagnosed epilepsy. Future studies should address if interventions like information about high-risk periods to patients and employers can improve psychosocial outcomes. Epilepsy can impact work ability, potentially leading to longer sick leaves or disability pensions, but shorter absences are less studied and are not included in the national registries in Sweden. This study explores shorter work absences in epilepsy patients attending neurology clinics in western Sweden. A quarter of patients reported missed workdays, but 68% had no sick leave recorded in national registries. Those with poorly controlled or newly diagnosed epilepsy were more likely to take sick leave, offering insights for patients, healthcare providers, and employers about managing epilepsy in the workplace.",10.1002/epi4.70029,"['Kerstin Andrén', 'David Larsson', 'Fredrik Asztély', 'Johan Zelano']",2025-Mar,Epilepsia open,"['Humans', 'Autism Spectrum Disorder', 'Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation', 'Child', 'Male', 'Female', 'Electroencephalography', 'Nerve Net', 'Brain Waves', 'Brain', 'Connectome', 'Humans', 'Child', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cochlear Implantation', 'Hearing Loss', 'Disease Progression', 'Hearing Aids', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Male', 'Adolescent', 'Bone Conduction']"

TDCS Modulates Brain Functional Networks in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Resting-State EEG Study.,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on brain functional networks in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We constructed brain functional networks using phase-locking value (PLV) and assessed the temporal variability of these networks using fuzzy entropy. Graph theory was applied to analyze network characteristics. Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) data were used to compare differences in brain functional connectivity, temporal variability, and network properties between children with ASD and typically developing (TD) children. Additionally, we examined the changes in functional connectivity, temporal variability, and network properties in children with ASD after 20 sessions of tDCS intervention. The study revealed that children with ASD exhibited lower connectivity in the alpha band and higher connectivity in the beta band. In the delta and theta bands, ASD children demonstrated a mixed pattern of both higher and lower connectivity. Furthermore, ASD children exhibited higher temporal variability across all four frequency bands, particularly in the delta and beta bands. After tDCS intervention, the total score of the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) significantly decreased. Additionally, functional connectivity in the delta and alpha bands increased, while temporal variability in the delta and beta bands decreased, indicating positive changes in brain network characteristics. These results suggest that tDCS may be a promising intervention for modulating brain functional networks in children with ASD. ChiCTR2400092790.

In vitro models of valproic acid to assess neurodevelopmental toxicity: A scoping review.,"Valproic acid (VPA) is a first-line antiseizure medication (ASM) that is highly efficacious for treating generalized and focal epilepsy disorders. Unfortunately, due to its strong association with teratogenic effects culminating in fetal valproate spectrum disorder (FVSD), which may include neurocognitive and neurobehavioral deficits, the drug has become highly regulated/restricted for women of childbearing potential. This includes those who have been shown to respond well to the drug and respond poorly to alternative ASMs. Concurrently, VPA's neurotoxic, teratogenic mechanisms have been studied in vitro, and continued research may aid in providing depth to our understanding so that superior evidence-based care plans and novel drug designs can be made for patients with epilepsy disorders. This scoping review systematically assesses what in vitro studies have discovered regarding VPA's effects on neural cells and the proposed cellular neurotoxic mechanisms. Neurotoxicity studies have captured the cytotoxic, dysmorphological, genetic, and epigenetic effects in murine and human primary, immortalized, and stem cells in vitro. This includes extensive identification of many genes and gene pathways associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, a hallmark of FVSD. Although published studies have illuminated much about VPA's neurotoxic, teratogenic effects, a lack of standardization in testing methodologies renders making direct comparisons between the results of different studies challenging. Nevertheless, the recent use of human stem cell-based models provides a richer understanding of what cellular, molecular, genetic, and epigenetic effects are caused by VPA exposure. Future in vitro studies may improve their clinical translatability by administering clinically relevant concentrations of VPA to human stem cell-derived neural cells and fostering a better understanding of VPA's neural cell type-specific and epigenetic effects. In vitro VPA neurotoxicity studies on neurodevelopment show a clear potential to provide data that may help construct superior personalized evidence-based treatment plans and novel drug designs for women of childbearing potential with epilepsy disorders.",10.1111/epi.18392,"['Daniel Sandvik', 'Elena Vianca', 'Alison Anderson', 'Muhammad Shahid Javaid', ""Terence J O'Brien"", 'Ana Antonic-Baker']",2025-Mar,Epilepsia,"['Humans', 'Autism Spectrum Disorder', 'Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation', 'Child', 'Male', 'Female', 'Electroencephalography', 'Nerve Net', 'Brain Waves', 'Brain', 'Connectome', 'Humans', 'Child', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cochlear Implantation', 'Hearing Loss', 'Disease Progression', 'Hearing Aids', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Male', 'Adolescent', 'Bone Conduction']"
Neurodegenerative and Neurodevelopmental Roles for Bulk Lipid Transporters VPS13A and BLTP2.,"Bridge-like lipid transfer proteins (BLTPs) mediate bulk lipid transport at membrane contact sites. Mutations in BLTPs are linked to both early-onset neurodevelopmental and later-onset neurodegenerative diseases, including movement disorders. The tissue specificity and temporal requirements of BLTPs in disease pathogenesis remain poorly understood. The objective of this study was to determine tissue-specific and aging-dependent roles for VPS13A and BLTP2 using Drosophila models. We generated tissue-specific knockdowns of the VPS13A ortholog (Vps13) and the BLTP2 ortholog (hobbit) in neurons and muscles of Drosophila. We analyzed age-dependent locomotor behavior, neurodegeneration, and synapse development and function. Neuron-specific loss of the VPS13A ortholog caused neurodegeneration followed by aging-dependent movement deficits and reduced lifespan, whereas muscle-specific loss affected only lifespan. In contrast, neuronal loss of the BLTP2 ortholog resulted in severe early-onset locomotor defects without neurodegeneration, whereas muscle loss impaired synaptogenesis and neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction. VPS13A maintains neuronal survival, whereas BLTP2 orchestrates synaptic development. The phenotypic specificity of BLTP function provides mechanistic insights into distinct disease trajectories for BLTP-associated disorders. © 2025 The Author(s).

Feeding style alters the growth and behavior of artificially-reared pigs.,"Early-life pig growth is influenced by protein synthesis facilitated by sow milk intake. However, factors such as teat disorders, timing of milk letdown, and seasonal fluctuations can limit milk intake, leading to slower growth and higher mortality rates. Artificial rearing systems allow precise regulation of milk intake, providing a valuable platform for researchers to investigate various feeding strategies, such as ad libitum or weight-based feeding and their impacts on behavior, growth, and health. In our study, focused on feeding style in an artificial rearing system, pigs (85 boars) were removed from the sow on postnatal day (PND) 2 and allotted to treatment based on litter of origin and body weight (BW). Pigs were reared in 4 cohorts across 2 trials over a 15-d feeding period. Experimental treatments included: AD, nutritionally adequate milk replacer provided ad libitum or PRE, nutritionally adequate milk replacer delivered at a prescribed basis according to individual pig BW, which was provided once per hour throughout a 20 h daily feeding cycle. Home-cage tracking and growth performance were measured throughout the study. On PND 6 and 14 an ethogram-based video analysis was performed, spanning the 20-h feeding cycle, to assess home-cage behavioral outcomes. Insulin responsivity was measured near study conclusion utilizing a feeding-stimulated method and static blood collection time-points. At study conclusion, pigs were euthanized and underwent body composition analysis. Data were analyzed via a repeated measures or 1-way ANOVA, with significance accepted at an alpha level of 0.05. Pigs in the AD group exhibited increased (P < 0.05) intake and BW gain but decreased feed efficiency when compared with the PRE group. Additionally, feeding style increased (P < 0.05) serum insulin concentrations 0.5 h after the first feeding in AD pigs when compared with PRE pigs. Feeding style altered (P < 0.05) spatial preference in trial 1 with PRE pigs spending relatively more time in the home-cage quadrant that housed the milk bowl compared with AD pigs. Moreover, PRE pigs spent more (P < 0.05) time visiting the feeding bowl and performing milk consumption behaviors at the bowl than AD pigs. Lastly, the relative proportion of water within soft tissue was increased (P < 0.05) in PRE pigs compared with AD pigs. In conclusion, feeding style impacted growth performance, insulin concentrations, spatial preference, and behavior of artificially-reared pigs.",10.1093/jas/skaf098,"['Kaitlyn M Sommer', 'Loretta Sutkus', 'Pradeep Senthil', 'Ryan N Dilger']",2025-Mar,Journal of animal science,"['Humans', 'Autism Spectrum Disorder', 'Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation', 'Child', 'Male', 'Female', 'Electroencephalography', 'Nerve Net', 'Brain Waves', 'Brain', 'Connectome', 'Humans', 'Child', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cochlear Implantation', 'Hearing Loss', 'Disease Progression', 'Hearing Aids', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Male', 'Adolescent', 'Bone Conduction']"

Patients on treatment with risdiplam in Italy: challenges in the interpretation of the real-world data.,"(i) provide a snapshot from a large cohort of Italian patients with SMA on risdiplam in the real-world setting; (ii) identify any differences in the cohorts before and after commercial drug approval considering the different eligibility access criteria (iii) describe preliminary data on adherence to treatment and reasons for shifting from nusinersen to risdiplam. Charts from patients on risdiplam were retrospectively reviewed. Results were then compared between patients accessing the drug during an initial restricted compassionate use program (cohort 1) and those after commercial approval, with no restrictions (cohort 2). Side effects and adherence were recorded for both cohorts as well as data on shifters. 283 patients (median age: 22 years) were included. Only a minority were walkers. Respiratory and bulbar comorbidities were more severe in cohort 1 (58% non sitters) than in cohort 2 (52% sitters). 35% and 46% of patients from cohorts 1 and 2 shifted from nusinersen to risdiplam respectively. Adherence and safety profile were good in both cohorts. This is the largest cohort described so far providing insights on the characteristics of patients on risdiplam in the real world. The disability level and age were very different from those that had driven efficacy results in the trials. This may at least in part produce some evidence to account for the variable results reported so far in the realworld.

Stimulation Parameters Recruit Distinct Cortico-Cortical Pathways: Insights from Microstate Analysis on TMS-Evoked Potentials.,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked potentials (TEPs) represent an innovative measure for examining brain connectivity and developing biomarkers of psychiatric conditions. Minimizing TEP variability across studies and participants, which may stem from methodological choices, is therefore vital. By combining classic peak analysis and microstate investigation, we tested how TMS pulse waveform and current direction may affect cortico-cortical circuit engagement when targeting the primary motor cortex (M1). We aim to disentangle whether changing these parameters affects the degree of activation of the same neural circuitry or may lead to changes in the pathways through which the induced activation spreads. Thirty-two healthy participants underwent a TMS-EEG experiment in which the pulse waveform (monophasic, biphasic) and current direction (posterior-anterior, anterior-posterior, latero-medial) were manipulated. We assessed the latency and amplitude of M1-TEP components and employed microstate analyses to test differences in topographies. Results revealed that TMS parameters strongly influenced M1-TEP components' amplitude but had a weaker role over their latencies. Microstate analysis showed that the current direction in monophasic stimulations changed the pattern of evoked microstates at the early TEP latencies, as well as their duration and global field power. This study shows that the current direction of monophasic pulses may modulate cortical sources contributing to TEP signals, activating neural populations and cortico-cortical paths more selectively. Biphasic stimulation reduces the variability associated with current direction and may be better suited when TMS targeting is blind to anatomical information.",10.1007/s10548-025-01113-2,"['Delia Lucarelli', 'Giacomo Guidali', 'Dominika Sulcova', 'Agnese Zazio', 'Natale Salvatore Bonfiglio', 'Antonietta Stango', 'Guido Barchiesi', 'Marta Bortoletto']",2025-Mar,Brain topography,"['Humans', 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation', 'Male', 'Female', 'Adult', 'Electroencephalography', 'Motor Cortex', 'Young Adult', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Neural Pathways', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Humans', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Folate Receptor 1', 'Aged', 'Brain', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Middle Aged', 'Humans', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Aged', 'Gait Disorders, Neurologic', 'Middle Aged', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Antiparkinson Agents', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Humans', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Adult', 'Young Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Aging', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Electrophysiological Phenomena', 'Female', 'Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Mice', 'Neurotensin', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Hypothermia, Induced', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Male', 'Peptides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"

Prefrontal-hippocampal pathways underlying adolescent resilience.,"The prefrontal-hippocampal pathways are integral to memory suppression, facilitating positive and adaptative responses following traumatic events. However, the role of these circuits in promoting resilience among adolescents remains largely unknown. This study used structural similarity analysis of MRI-based gray matter volume (GMV) to map connectivity networks centered on the hippocampus, investigating whether structural similarity between prefrontal regions and hippocampus were related to resilience in a cohort of 145 adolescents. Additionally, spatial correlation analyses of resilience-related structural similarity network and neurotransmitter distribution maps were conducted to identify molecular adaptations within prefrontal-hippocampal circuits associated with resilience. The results showed that higher resilience levels were correlated with stronger structural similarity between the prefrontal areas (i.e., middle frontal gyrus and orbitofrontal cortex) and hippocampus. Furthermore, the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, which modulates neural oscillations in prefrontal-hippocampal pathways, appears to be associated with resilience. The current findings suggest that structural and molecular adaptations within prefrontal-hippocampal circuits, which are implicated in the suppression of intrusive, unwanted memories, may foster resilience in young people. These insights advance our knowledge of the neurobiological markers of resilience, paving the way for more targeted and effective therapeutic interventions to bolster resilience and mitigate adverse outcomes in developmental populations.",10.1007/s00787-025-02704-x,"['Luqing Wei', 'Zhengdong Wu', 'Qi Xia', 'Chris Baeken', 'Guo-Rong Wu']",2025-Mar,European child & adolescent psychiatry,"['Humans', 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation', 'Male', 'Female', 'Adult', 'Electroencephalography', 'Motor Cortex', 'Young Adult', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Neural Pathways', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Humans', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Folate Receptor 1', 'Aged', 'Brain', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Middle Aged', 'Humans', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Aged', 'Gait Disorders, Neurologic', 'Middle Aged', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Antiparkinson Agents', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Humans', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Adult', 'Young Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Aging', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Electrophysiological Phenomena', 'Female', 'Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Mice', 'Neurotensin', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Hypothermia, Induced', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Male', 'Peptides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
Sex-specific modulation of FOLR1 and its cycle enzyme genes in Alzheimer's disease brain regions.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by progressive cognitive and functional decline. Its incidence increases significantly with age and is more prevalent in women than men. We investigated the folate receptor alpha (FOLR1) gene expression levels in the central nervous system (CNS) of AD and non-demented healthy control (NDHC) subjects. Our cohort included 3,946 samples: 2,391 NDHC and 1,555 AD patients, stratified by brain region, age, and sex. Interestingly, a significant increase in FOLR1 expression was observed only in females with AD compared to NDHC females. Furthermore, we found that FOLR1 expression was differentially increased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and diencephalon (DIE) only in AD females. Moreover, in females, genes involved in the folic acid (FA) cycle that drives DNA synthesis were significantly modulated. In contrast, in males, downregulation of TYMS effectively blocks the completion of the cycle, thereby preventing downstream DNA synthesis. Tissue Transcriptome Deconvolution (TTD) analysis revealed astrocytes and endothelial cells associated with FOLR1 expression in both AD males and females. Gene Ontology analysis supported these findings, showing enrichment in processes aligned with these cell types. Positive correlations between brain FOLR1 expression and markers for astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and endothelial cells (CD31) provided further validation. Our findings suggest a potential role for sex-dependent FOLR1 expression and its association with specific brain regions and cellular processes in AD.",10.1007/s11011-025-01578-x,"['Cristina Sanfilippo', 'Paola Castrogiovanni', 'Rosa Imbesi', 'Michele Vecchio', 'Manlio Vinciguerra', 'Kaj Blennow', 'Henrik Zetterberg', 'Michelino Di Rosa']",2025-Mar,Metabolic brain disease,"['Humans', 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation', 'Male', 'Female', 'Adult', 'Electroencephalography', 'Motor Cortex', 'Young Adult', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Neural Pathways', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Humans', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Folate Receptor 1', 'Aged', 'Brain', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Middle Aged', 'Humans', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Aged', 'Gait Disorders, Neurologic', 'Middle Aged', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Antiparkinson Agents', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Humans', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Adult', 'Young Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Aging', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Electrophysiological Phenomena', 'Female', 'Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Mice', 'Neurotensin', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Hypothermia, Induced', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Male', 'Peptides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
The effects of dopaminergic medication and task load on trembling and akinetic freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease.,"In people with Parkinson's disease (PD), freezing of gait (FOG) can manifest as an absence of leg movement (akinetic) or a presence of high-frequency leg trembling. FOG is triggered most often during turning or dual-tasking when OFF-medication, but it is unclear whether the same holds true for akinetic and trembling FOG. To investigate the effects of dopaminergic medication and cognitive and motor tasks on trembling and akinetic FOG. Sixty-three PD patients with daily FOG performed a home-based FOG-provoking protocol OFF and ON-dopaminergic medication. FOG was video-annotated based on pre-specified definitions. We compared the % time in trembling and in akinetic FOG between OFF and ON. We also analyzed these outcomes during various motor tasks and with- and without a cognitive dual task. To identify subgroups, an exploratory k-means cluster analysis was performed. Trembling and akinetic FOG co-occurred in most patients (82.5%), although trembling was observed most frequently. Both manifestations were ameliorated by medication, but we identified four different patterns: a responsive mild group (n = 32), an unresponsive akinetic-dominant group (n = 8), and two trembling-dominant groups with (n = 12) and without (n = 11) a response to medication. Task load also affected the manifestations differentially, as dual-tasking and gait initiation induced more akinetic FOG compared to other conditions. Trembling and akinetic FOG respond similarly to dopaminergic medication (except for a specific trembling subgroup), yet they are differentially influenced by FOG triggers. Altogether, we suggest that ""trembling"" may represent a milder form of FOG, although ""trembling"" as a distinct FOG-variant cannot be rule out.",10.1007/s00415-025-13023-1,"['Demi Zoetewei', 'Pieter Ginis', 'Talia Herman', 'Moran Gilat', ""Nicholas D'Cruz"", 'Luca Palmerini', 'Eran Gazit', 'Jeffrey M Hausdorff', 'Alice Nieuwboer']",2025-Mar,Journal of neurology,"['Humans', 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation', 'Male', 'Female', 'Adult', 'Electroencephalography', 'Motor Cortex', 'Young Adult', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Neural Pathways', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Humans', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Folate Receptor 1', 'Aged', 'Brain', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Middle Aged', 'Humans', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Aged', 'Gait Disorders, Neurologic', 'Middle Aged', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Antiparkinson Agents', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Humans', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Adult', 'Young Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Aging', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Electrophysiological Phenomena', 'Female', 'Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Mice', 'Neurotensin', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Hypothermia, Induced', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Male', 'Peptides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
Managing impulse control and related behavioral disorders in Parkinson's disease: where we are in 2025?,"Impulse control and related behavioral disorders (ICBDs) commonly complicate Parkinson's disease (PD) course. The ICBDs spectrum encompasses two groups of conditions, with distinct pathophysiology: proper 'impulse control disorders (ICDs)' (e.g. gambling) and the 'ICDs related disorders (ICDs-RD)' (e.g. punding). Behavioral disturbances are associated with dopamine replacement therapies. ICBDs significantly affect the quality of life of patients and caregivers, making their management essential for reducing the overall burden of PD. This article reviews the current management strategies for ICBDs in PD. The authors highlight their strengths and limitations of these strategies, and explore the potential role of emerging treatment options, giving particular focus to new compounds and invasive therapies. Prevention, close monitoring and caregiver involvement are essential in managing ICBDs in PD. Treatment approaches should be tailored to ICBDs' functional impact and aimed to reduce the pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors, especially D2. Dopamine agonist (DA) tapering remains the primary therapeutic approach for ICDs, alongside psychotherapy and second-line agents, like atypical antipsychotics and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. Insights into ICDs pathophysiology and DA-specific pharmacodynamics indicate safer profiles for certain preparations (e.g. rotigotine patches) and possibly for D1/D5 agonists like tavapadon. Invasive treatments, including deep brain stimulation and infusion therapies, should be prioritized in advanced-stage PD complicated by ICBDs.",10.1080/14737175.2025.2485337,"['Leonardo Rigon', 'Carmelo Fogliano', 'K Ray Chaudhuri', 'Karolina Poplawska-Domaszewicz', 'Cristian Falup-Pecurariu', 'Iulia Murasan', 'Mirjam Wolfschlag', 'Per Odin', 'Angelo Antonini']",2025-Mar,Expert review of neurotherapeutics,"['Humans', 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation', 'Male', 'Female', 'Adult', 'Electroencephalography', 'Motor Cortex', 'Young Adult', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Neural Pathways', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Humans', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Folate Receptor 1', 'Aged', 'Brain', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Middle Aged', 'Humans', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Aged', 'Gait Disorders, Neurologic', 'Middle Aged', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Antiparkinson Agents', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Humans', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Adult', 'Young Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Aging', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Electrophysiological Phenomena', 'Female', 'Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Mice', 'Neurotensin', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Hypothermia, Induced', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Male', 'Peptides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
Electrophysiology and morphology of human cortical supragranular pyramidal cells in a wide age range.,"The basic excitatory neurons of the cerebral cortex, the pyramidal cells, are the most important signal integrators for the local circuit. They have quite characteristic morphological and electrophysiological properties that are known to be largely constant with age in the young and adult cortex. However, the brain undergoes several dynamic changes throughout life, such as in the phases of early development and cognitive decline in the aging brain. We set out to search for intrinsic cellular changes in supragranular pyramidal cells across a broad age range: from birth to 85 y of age and we found differences in several biophysical properties between defined age groups. During the first year of life, subthreshold and suprathreshold electrophysiological properties changed in a way that shows that pyramidal cells become less excitable with maturation, but also become temporarily more precise. According to our findings, the morphological features of the three-dimensional reconstructions from different life stages showed consistent morphological properties and systematic dendritic spine analysis of an infantile and an old pyramidal cell showed clear significant differences in the distribution of spine shapes. Overall, the changes that occur during development and aging may have lasting effects on the properties of pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex. Understanding these changes is important to unravel the complex mechanisms underlying brain development, cognition, and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.",10.7554/eLife.100390,"['Pál Barzó', 'Ildikó Szöts', 'Martin Tóth', 'Éva Adrienn Csajbók', 'Gábor Molnár', 'Gábor Tamás']",2025-Mar,eLife,"['Humans', 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation', 'Male', 'Female', 'Adult', 'Electroencephalography', 'Motor Cortex', 'Young Adult', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Neural Pathways', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Humans', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Folate Receptor 1', 'Aged', 'Brain', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Middle Aged', 'Humans', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Aged', 'Gait Disorders, Neurologic', 'Middle Aged', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Antiparkinson Agents', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Humans', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Adult', 'Young Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Aging', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Electrophysiological Phenomena', 'Female', 'Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Mice', 'Neurotensin', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Hypothermia, Induced', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Male', 'Peptides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
"A peptide-neurotensin conjugate that crosses the blood-brain barrier induces pharmacological hypothermia associated with anticonvulsant, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory properties following status epilepticus in mice.","Preclinical and clinical studies show that mild to moderate hypothermia is neuroprotective in sudden cardiac arrest, ischemic stroke, perinatal hypoxia/ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and seizures. Induction of hypothermia largely involves physical cooling therapies, which induce several clinical complications, while some molecules have shown to be efficient in pharmacologically induced hypothermia (PIH). Neurotensin (NT), a 13 amino acid neuropeptide that regulates body temperature, interacts with various receptors to mediate its peripheral and central effects. NT induces PIH when administered intracerebrally. However, these effects are not observed if NT is administered peripherally, due to its rapid degradation and poor passage of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We conjugated NT to peptides that bind the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) to generate 'vectorized' forms of NT with enhanced BBB permeability. We evaluated their effects in epileptic conditions following peripheral administration. One of these conjugates, VH-N412, displayed improved stability, binding potential to both the LDLR and NTSR-1, rodent/human cross-reactivity and improved brain distribution. In a mouse model of kainate (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE), VH-N412 elicited rapid hypothermia associated with anticonvulsant effects, potent neuroprotection, and reduced hippocampal inflammation. VH-N412 also reduced sprouting of the dentate gyrus mossy fibers and preserved learning and memory skills in the treated mice. In cultured hippocampal neurons, VH-N412 displayed temperature-independent neuroprotective properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the successful treatment of SE with PIH. In all, our results show that vectorized NT may elicit different neuroprotection mechanisms mediated by hypothermia and/or by intrinsic neuroprotective properties.",10.7554/eLife.100527,"['Lotfi Ferhat', 'Rabia Soussi', 'Maxime Masse', 'Grigorios Kyriatzis', 'Stéphane Girard', 'Fanny Gassiot', 'Nicolas Gaudin', 'Mathieu Laurencin', 'Anne Bernard', 'Angélique Bôle', 'Géraldine Ferracci', 'Maria Smirnova', 'François Roman', 'Vincent Dive', 'Salvatore Cisternino', 'Jamal Temsamani', 'Marion David', 'Pascaline Lécorché', 'Guillaume Jacquot', 'Michel Khrestchatisky']",2025-Mar,eLife,"['Humans', 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation', 'Male', 'Female', 'Adult', 'Electroencephalography', 'Motor Cortex', 'Young Adult', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Neural Pathways', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Humans', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Folate Receptor 1', 'Aged', 'Brain', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Middle Aged', 'Humans', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Aged', 'Gait Disorders, Neurologic', 'Middle Aged', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Antiparkinson Agents', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Humans', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Adult', 'Young Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Aging', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Electrophysiological Phenomena', 'Female', 'Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Mice', 'Neurotensin', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Hypothermia, Induced', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Male', 'Peptides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
Robot-Assisted Versus Open Radical Cystectomy: Comparison of Adverse In-Hospital Outcomes.,"To quantify improvements in adverse in-hospital outcomes between historical and contemporary robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) versus historical and contemporary open RC (ORC). Within the National Inpatient Sample (2010-2019), RARC and ORC ileal conduit diversion patients were identified. Multivariable logistic and Poisson regression models were fitted. Of RARC patients, 1343 (39%) were historical (2010-2014) and 2087 (61%) were contemporary (2015-2019). Of ORC patients, 5812 (54%) were historical and 5019 (46%) were contemporary. Versus historical counterparts, contemporary RARC patients exhibited significantly better adverse in-hospital outcomes in 9 of 13 categories, with improvements ranging from -82% for intraoperative complications to -22% for cumulative postoperative complications. Similarly, versus historical, contemporary ORC patients also exhibited significantly better adverse in-hospital outcomes in 9 of 13 categories, with improvements ranging from -72% for intraoperative complications to -12% for median length of stay (LOS). When contemporary RARC was compared to contemporary ORC, RARC adverse in-hospital outcomes were better in 7 of 13 comparisons, with improvements ranging from -55% for blood transfusions to -18% for median LOS. Similarly, when historical RARC was compared to historical ORC, RARC adverse in-hospital outcomes were better in 6 of 13 comparisons, with improvements ranging from -55% for blood transfusions to -15% for median LOS. The magnitude of the improvement in adverse in-hospital outcomes was comparable between contemporary versus historical RARC (nine improved categories) and contemporary versus historical ORC (nine improved categories).

Bilateral Endoscopic Type 1 Tympanoplasty in a Single Session: Functional and Clinical Outcomes.,"This study aims to evaluate the functional and clinical outcomes of single-session bilateral endoscopic type 1 tympanoplasty, with a focus on postoperative (post-op) hearing improvement and graft success rates in patients with chronic otitis media and tympanic membrane perforations. Fifteen patients (30 ears) with bilateral dry tympanic membrane perforations underwent trans-canal endoscopic type 1 tympanoplasty using a tragal perichondrium graft. Preoperative (pre-op) and post-op audiometric data, including pure-tone averages (PTAs) and air-bone gap (ABG) measurements at various frequencies, were collected and analyzed. Functional success was defined as a post-op ABG <20 dB and PTA level improvements, while clinical success was determined by the presence of an intact tympanic membrane graft. The mean pre-op ABG significantly decreased post-oply in both ears, with an average ABG improvement of 25.00±7.32 dB at 500 Hz in the right ear and 18.00±8.41 dB in the left ear. The post-op PTA demonstrated an average gain of 27.00±7.51 dB in the right ear and 29.33±6.23 dB in the left ear. The functional success rate, defined as a post-op ABG <20 dB, was 93.33%, while clinical success, based on graft integrity, was also 93.33%. Single-session bilateral endoscopic tympanoplasty is a safe and effective procedure with high functional and clinical success rates.

The glymphatic system in Huntington's disease.,"The glymphatic system, a macroscopic waste clearance network in the brain, plays a vital role in maintaining neuronal health and brain homeostasis. Functionally analogous to the lymphatic system in other organs, the term ""glymphatic"" combines ""glial"" and ""lymphatic."" This system facilitates the exchange of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid (ISF) in the parenchyma, aiding in the removal of soluble proteins and metabolites while distributing essential nutrients and signaling molecules. Its functionality is closely tied to aquaporin 4 (AQP4) water channels, located primarily on astrocytic endfeet, which mediate water movement between the CSF and ISF. Proper glymphatic function relies on the cellular distribution of AQP4 channels and its astroglial endfeet polarization. Emerging evidence links glymphatic dysfunction to several neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD). Understanding the role of the glymphatic system in HD pathogenesis could provide novel insights into disease pathogenesis and new therapeutic approaches. This review examines the connection between glymphatic dysfunction and HD, highlighting future research directions and therapeutic advancement for HD.

A Survey Exploring People's Experiences With Lithium Bought as a Supplement: Une enquête sur l'expérience des personnes avec le lithium en supplément.,"ObjectiveLithium, despite its evidence base and range of indications, is often underutilized due to safety concerns associated with high-dose prescriptions and consequent necessity for regular blood monitoring. Emerging evidence suggests its potential benefits at lower doses, especially for its pro-cognitive effects and positive safety profile. While accessible as a supplement, empirical human evidence on neuropsychiatric effects is lacking. This study aimed to provide preliminary evidence regarding the utilization and perceived effects of low-dose lithium supplements (LiS) in the community.MethodsCross-sectional, opportunistic survey of 211 participants aged ≥18 years who disclosed taking over-the-counter lithium supplements. The survey assessed sample demographics, supplement details, overall perspectives, and personal experiences related to the use of LiS.ResultsThe most common form of LiS taken was aspartate at 10 mg once per day, although lithium orotate and ionic lithium were also frequently used. The most common beliefs regarding the benefits of using lithium as a supplement concern efficacy for anxiety, but the most common improvements experienced was in the domain of cognition, closely followed by anxiety and mood. Mood was most commonly reported as the greatest improvement. Side effects and withdrawal phenomena were more prevalent than anticipated.ConclusionThis study revealed a diverse range of lithium supplements taken, in terms of dosage, formulation, frequency, and duration of intake. Anecdotal evidence highlighted prevalent perceived benefits and adverse effects. The study is, however, limited notably by its cross-sectional opportunistic design; more robust evidence, especially from controlled trials, is needed to fully establish the specific benefits and drawbacks associated with different forms and doses of accessible lithium supplements.Plain Language Summary TitleA survey exploring people's experiences with lithium bought as a supplement.",10.1177/07067437251328282,"['Rebecca Strawbridge', 'Samuel Myrtle', 'Pietro Carmellini', 'Elliot Hampsey', 'David A Cousins', 'Allan H Young']",2025-Mar,Canadian journal of psychiatry.

Regional Variation in Supply and Use of Psychiatric Services in 3 Canadian Provinces: Variation régionale de l'offre de services psychiatriques et de leur utilisation dans trois provinces canadiennes.,"ObjectiveTo examine the patterns in the supply and use of psychiatric services in 3 Canadian provinces: British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario.MethodsWe conducted a repeated cross-sectional analysis spanning fiscal years 2012/13 to 2021/22, using patient- and psychiatrist-level data aggregated into administrative health regions. Descriptive statistics and linear regression were used to assess patterns and relationships between the per capita number of psychiatrists (""supply"") and measures of use of psychiatric services (""utilization""), including any psychiatrist contact, psychiatric consultation (1-2 visits with the same psychiatrist), and ongoing psychiatric care (3 or more visits with the same psychiatrist).ResultsThe number of psychiatrists per capita remained stable within the 3 provinces during the study period. In 2021/22, Vancouver had the highest number in British Columbia (45 psychiatrists per 100,000 individuals), compared to 14 per 100,000 in lower-supply regions.

Association of Ischemic Core Hypodensity With Thrombectomy Treatment Effect in Large Core Stroke: A Secondary Analysis of the SELECT2 Randomized Controlled Trial.,"We aimed to determine whether extensive severe computed tomography (CT) hypodensity, representing blood-brain barrier injury, would be associated with a reduced benefit of endovascular therapy (EVT) in patients presenting with large core stroke. This study is an exploratory analysis of SELECT2 (Randomized Controlled Trial to Optimize Patient's Selection for Endovascular Treatment in Acute Ischemic Stroke), a randomized controlled trial of EVT versus medical management in patients with large ischemic core who presented to 31 comprehensive stroke centers across the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Visible CT hypodensity was outlined, and a threshold of severe CT hypodensity was defined as the lower 99% CI of contralateral thalamic gray matter in Hounsfield units (HU). The association between the volume of severe CT hypodensity and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 to 3 was evaluated using logistic regression models, with adjustment for age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, total noncontrast CT core volume, and a volume-by-treatment interaction. The relationship between severe CT hypodensity volume and the probability of an mRS score of 0 to 3 was used to select clinically relevant volume cut points for further evaluation. The treatment effect of EVT versus medical management on independent ambulation and hemicraniectomy was assessed in 2 subgroups based on these volume cut points. In 322 patients, the median CT density was 31 HU (interquartile range, 28-34). The selected threshold of severe CT hypodensity was 26 HU. The volume of ischemic core ≤26 HU (per 1 mL increase) was associated with lower odds of mRS score of 0 to 3 after EVT (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.96 [95% CI, 0.94-0.99]), but not medical management (aOR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.98-1.03];  Severe hypodensity within large ischemic regions modifies the thrombectomy treatment effect and increases the likelihood of hemicraniectomy, independent of lesion volume.

The future of paediatric sleep medicine: a blueprint for advancing the field.,"Paediatric sleep medicine has rapidly evolved and expanded over the past half century as it became increasingly recognised as a unique field related to but distinct from adult sleep medicine. In looking forward to the next years, the focus of the following discussion is two-fold: to summarise a brief history of the field, recent developments and current trends, and to present a blueprint for the future across various key domains. Using Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory as a model for the interaction between the five interconnected ecosystems and sleep in children, we discuss a variety of topics relevant for the present state and future of paediatric sleep medicine. Such topics include the potential effects of climate change and war on children's sleep, the development of public policy initiatives-such as sleep education in schools and in communities, and global efforts to reduce the epidemic of insufficient sleep. Indeed, insufficient sleep contributes to a myriad of negative medical, mental health, functional, and safety consequences. We also focus on the development of paediatric sleep medicine-specific educational initiatives and training programmes, and we showcase professional organisations such as the International Paediatric Sleep Association that are dedicated to the global expansion of paediatric sleep medicine. Finally, we address the need for further interdisciplinary collaborations, identify critical research gaps and explore the potential role of artificial intelligence and other new technologies in paediatric sleep research, including standardisation of sleep measurements, and novel methods of monitoring sleep in children.",10.1111/jsr.14482,"['Angelika A Schlarb', 'Sarah Blunden', 'Serge Brand', 'Olivero Bruni', 'Penny Corkum', 'Rosemary S C Horne', 'Osman S Ipsiroglu', 'Mirja Quante', 'Karen Spruyt', 'Judith Owens']",2025-Mar,Journal of sleep research,nan
The prevalence of mild behavioral impairment in older adults with mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BackgroundMild behavioral impairment is a neurobehavioral symptom characterized by the onset of a new and persistent neuropsychiatric syndrome. Patients with co-occurring mild behavioral impairment and mild cognitive impairment have the relatively highest probability of developing dementia than sick mild behavioral impairment or mild cognitive impairment alone.ObjectiveThis study aimed to determine the currently available best estimate of mild behavioral impairment prevalence and clarify the reasons for the difference in estimates.MethodsData were retrieved and collected from five electronic databases. Two reviewers independently appraised the methodological quality of included studies. Heterogeneity was assessed by using the I² statistic and random effects models were employed. Sources of heterogeneity were investigated by subgroup analysis and meta-regression. All statistical analyses were conducted by Stata.ResultsA total of 23 reports involving 5397 participants were included in this systematic review. The pooled effect size for the overall mild behavioral impairment was 52% (95%CI 42-62%). In the subgroup analysis and regression analysis, we found that study type, study area, assessment tools, and study subject gender could explain part of the source of heterogeneity.ConclusionsThe results of this review suggest that 52% with mild cognitive impairment combined with mild behavioral impairment; there is a close relationship between the two. Future studies should pay more attention to the underlying mechanism between the two and provide a more scientific basis for early discrimination of clinical dementia and Alzheimer's disease.",10.1177/13872877251328712,"['Yan Zhao', 'Chang Tan', 'Yingjing Lu', 'Yingling Ge', 'Na Zhao', 'Yajie Tian', 'Liuyang Hui', 'Xiaobei Feng', 'Zihan Liu', 'Sha Li', 'Huixian Cui']",2025-Mar,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,nan
