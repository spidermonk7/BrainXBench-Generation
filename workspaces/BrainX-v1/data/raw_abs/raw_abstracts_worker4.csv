Bilateral Endoscopic Type 1 Tympanoplasty in a Single Session: Functional and Clinical Outcomes.,"This study aims to evaluate the functional and clinical outcomes of single-session bilateral endoscopic type 1 tympanoplasty, with a focus on postoperative (post-op) hearing improvement and graft success rates in patients with chronic otitis media and tympanic membrane perforations. Fifteen patients (30 ears) with bilateral dry tympanic membrane perforations underwent trans-canal endoscopic type 1 tympanoplasty using a tragal perichondrium graft. Preoperative (pre-op) and post-op audiometric data, including pure-tone averages (PTAs) and air-bone gap (ABG) measurements at various frequencies, were collected and analyzed. Functional success was defined as a post-op ABG <20 dB and PTA level improvements, while clinical success was determined by the presence of an intact tympanic membrane graft. The mean pre-op ABG significantly decreased post-oply in both ears, with an average ABG improvement of 25.00±7.32 dB at 500 Hz in the right ear and 18.00±8.41 dB in the left ear. The post-op PTA demonstrated an average gain of 27.00±7.51 dB in the right ear and 29.33±6.23 dB in the left ear. The functional success rate, defined as a post-op ABG <20 dB, was 93.33%, while clinical success, based on graft integrity, was also 93.33%. Single-session bilateral endoscopic tympanoplasty is a safe and effective procedure with high functional and clinical success rates. It leads to significant hearing improvement and has minimal post-op complications.",10.4274/tao.2024.2024-10-7,"['Aynur Aliyeva', 'Ramil Hashimli']",2025-Mar,Turkish archives of otorhinolaryngology,N/A
The glymphatic system in Huntington's disease.,"The glymphatic system, a macroscopic waste clearance network in the brain, plays a vital role in maintaining neuronal health and brain homeostasis. Functionally analogous to the lymphatic system in other organs, the term ""glymphatic"" combines ""glial"" and ""lymphatic."" This system facilitates the exchange of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid (ISF) in the parenchyma, aiding in the removal of soluble proteins and metabolites while distributing essential nutrients and signaling molecules. Its functionality is closely tied to aquaporin 4 (AQP4) water channels, located primarily on astrocytic endfeet, which mediate water movement between the CSF and ISF. Proper glymphatic function relies on the cellular distribution of AQP4 channels and its astroglial endfeet polarization. Emerging evidence links glymphatic dysfunction to several neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD). Understanding the role of the glymphatic system in HD pathogenesis could provide novel insights into disease pathogenesis and new therapeutic approaches. This review examines the connection between glymphatic dysfunction and HD, highlighting future research directions and therapeutic advancement for HD. It explores pharmacological interventions and lifestyle modifications aimed at optimizing glymphatic function to improve HD management.",10.1177/18796397251331436,"['Wenzhen Duan', 'Yuan Zhou', 'Hongshuai Liu']",2025-Mar,Journal of Huntington's disease,N/A

A Survey Exploring People's Experiences With Lithium Bought as a Supplement: Une enquête sur l'expérience des personnes avec le lithium en supplément.,"ObjectiveLithium, despite its evidence base and range of indications, is often underutilized due to safety concerns associated with high-dose prescriptions and consequent necessity for regular blood monitoring. Emerging evidence suggests its potential benefits at lower doses, especially for its pro-cognitive effects and positive safety profile. While accessible as a supplement, empirical human evidence on neuropsychiatric effects is lacking. This study aimed to provide preliminary evidence regarding the utilization and perceived effects of low-dose lithium supplements (LiS) in the community.MethodsCross-sectional, opportunistic survey of 211 participants aged ≥18 years who disclosed taking over-the-counter lithium supplements. The survey assessed sample demographics, supplement details, overall perspectives, and personal experiences related to the use of LiS.ResultsThe most common form of LiS taken was aspartate at 10 mg once per day, although lithium orotate and ionic lithium were also frequently used. The most common beliefs regarding the benefits of using lithium as a supplement concern efficacy for anxiety, but the most common improvements experienced was in the domain of cognition, closely followed by anxiety and mood. Mood was most commonly reported as the greatest improvement. Side effects and withdrawal phenomena were more prevalent than anticipated.ConclusionThis study revealed a diverse range of lithium supplements taken, in terms of dosage, formulation, frequency, and duration of intake. Anecdotal evidence highlighted prevalent perceived benefits and adverse effects. The study is, however, limited notably by its cross-sectional opportunistic design; more robust evidence, especially from controlled trials, is needed to fully establish the specific benefits and drawbacks associated with different forms and doses of accessible lithium supplements.Plain Language Summary TitleA survey exploring people's experiences with lithium bought as a supplement.",10.1177/07067437251328282,"['Rebecca Strawbridge', 'Samuel Myrtle', 'Pietro Carmellini', 'Elliot Hampsey', 'David A Cousins', 'Allan H Young']",2025-Mar,Canadian journal of psychiatry.

Ultrasound Imaging and Guidance for Plantar Fascia Lesions: EURO-MUSCULUS/USPRM Approach.,"Plantar fascia (PF) lesions, such as plantar fasciitis, PF tear, and plantar fibromatosis (Ledderhose disease), are among the common causes of heel pain. The management of these lesions includes conservative treatments, minimally invasive treatments, and surgical interventions. When conservative treatments fail, minimally invasive injection therapies have been proposed as alternatives for managing PF lesions. Despite the availability of various injectable options, where and how to perform the injection is still controversial in the pertinent literature. In this article, considering the paramount role of ultrasound imaging in the diagnosis, interventions, and follow-up for PF pathologies, we demonstrated our sonographic approach to PF lesions for sonographers/physicians in daily clinical practice.",10.1002/jum.16694,"['Pelin Analay', 'Murat Kara', 'Ahmad J Abdulsalam', 'Berkay Yalçınkaya', 'Vincenzo Ricci', 'Giulio Cocco', 'Ondřej Naňka', 'Levent Özçakar']",2025-Mar,Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine,N/A
Regional Variation in Supply and Use of Psychiatric Services in 3 Canadian Provinces: Variation régionale de l'offre de services psychiatriques et de leur utilisation dans trois provinces canadiennes.,"ObjectiveTo examine the patterns in the supply and use of psychiatric services in 3 Canadian provinces: British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario.MethodsWe conducted a repeated cross-sectional analysis spanning fiscal years 2012/13 to 2021/22, using patient- and psychiatrist-level data aggregated into administrative health regions. Descriptive statistics and linear regression were used to assess patterns and relationships between the per capita number of psychiatrists (""supply"") and measures of use of psychiatric services (""utilization""), including any psychiatrist contact, psychiatric consultation (1-2 visits with the same psychiatrist), and ongoing psychiatric care (3 or more visits with the same psychiatrist).ResultsThe number of psychiatrists per capita remained stable within the 3 provinces during the study period. In 2021/22, Vancouver had the highest number in British Columbia (45 psychiatrists per 100,000 individuals), compared to 14 per 100,000 in lower-supply regions. Toronto had the highest number in Ontario (38 per 100,000), compared to 9 in lower supply regions. Winnipeg had the highest number in Manitoba (25 per 100,000), compared to 7 in the lower supply regions. In 2021/22, the per capita number of psychiatrists was moderately correlated with any psychiatrist contact (",10.1177/07067437251322404,"['David Rudoler', 'Ridhwana Kaoser', 'M Ruth Lavergne', 'Sandra Peterson', 'James M Bolton', 'Matt Dahl', 'François Gallant', 'Kimberley P Good', 'Myriam Juda', 'Alan Katz', 'Jason Morrison', 'Benoit H Mulsant', 'Alison L Park', 'Philip G Tibbo', 'Juveria Zaheer', 'Paul Kurdyak']",2025-Mar,Canadian journal of psychiatry.

Association of Ischemic Core Hypodensity With Thrombectomy Treatment Effect in Large Core Stroke: A Secondary Analysis of the SELECT2 Randomized Controlled Trial.,"We aimed to determine whether extensive severe computed tomography (CT) hypodensity, representing blood-brain barrier injury, would be associated with a reduced benefit of endovascular therapy (EVT) in patients presenting with large core stroke. This study is an exploratory analysis of SELECT2 (Randomized Controlled Trial to Optimize Patient's Selection for Endovascular Treatment in Acute Ischemic Stroke), a randomized controlled trial of EVT versus medical management in patients with large ischemic core who presented to 31 comprehensive stroke centers across the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Visible CT hypodensity was outlined, and a threshold of severe CT hypodensity was defined as the lower 99% CI of contralateral thalamic gray matter in Hounsfield units (HU). The association between the volume of severe CT hypodensity and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 to 3 was evaluated using logistic regression models, with adjustment for age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, total noncontrast CT core volume, and a volume-by-treatment interaction. The relationship between severe CT hypodensity volume and the probability of an mRS score of 0 to 3 was used to select clinically relevant volume cut points for further evaluation. The treatment effect of EVT versus medical management on independent ambulation and hemicraniectomy was assessed in 2 subgroups based on these volume cut points. In 322 patients, the median CT density was 31 HU (interquartile range, 28-34). The selected threshold of severe CT hypodensity was 26 HU. The volume of ischemic core ≤26 HU (per 1 mL increase) was associated with lower odds of mRS score of 0 to 3 after EVT (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.96 [95% CI, 0.94-0.99]), but not medical management (aOR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.98-1.03];  Severe hypodensity within large ischemic regions modifies the thrombectomy treatment effect and increases the likelihood of hemicraniectomy, independent of lesion volume.

The future of paediatric sleep medicine: a blueprint for advancing the field.,"Paediatric sleep medicine has rapidly evolved and expanded over the past half century as it became increasingly recognised as a unique field related to but distinct from adult sleep medicine. In looking forward to the next years, the focus of the following discussion is two-fold: to summarise a brief history of the field, recent developments and current trends, and to present a blueprint for the future across various key domains. Using Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory as a model for the interaction between the five interconnected ecosystems and sleep in children, we discuss a variety of topics relevant for the present state and future of paediatric sleep medicine. Such topics include the potential effects of climate change and war on children's sleep, the development of public policy initiatives-such as sleep education in schools and in communities, and global efforts to reduce the epidemic of insufficient sleep. Indeed, insufficient sleep contributes to a myriad of negative medical, mental health, functional, and safety consequences. We also focus on the development of paediatric sleep medicine-specific educational initiatives and training programmes, and we showcase professional organisations such as the International Paediatric Sleep Association that are dedicated to the global expansion of paediatric sleep medicine. Finally, we address the need for further interdisciplinary collaborations, identify critical research gaps and explore the potential role of artificial intelligence and other new technologies in paediatric sleep research, including standardisation of sleep measurements, and novel methods of monitoring sleep in children.",10.1111/jsr.14482,"['Angelika A Schlarb', 'Sarah Blunden', 'Serge Brand', 'Olivero Bruni', 'Penny Corkum', 'Rosemary S C Horne', 'Osman S Ipsiroglu', 'Mirja Quante', 'Karen Spruyt', 'Judith Owens']",2025-Mar,Journal of sleep research,N/A
The prevalence of mild behavioral impairment in older adults with mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BackgroundMild behavioral impairment is a neurobehavioral symptom characterized by the onset of a new and persistent neuropsychiatric syndrome. Patients with co-occurring mild behavioral impairment and mild cognitive impairment have the relatively highest probability of developing dementia than sick mild behavioral impairment or mild cognitive impairment alone.ObjectiveThis study aimed to determine the currently available best estimate of mild behavioral impairment prevalence and clarify the reasons for the difference in estimates.MethodsData were retrieved and collected from five electronic databases. Two reviewers independently appraised the methodological quality of included studies. Heterogeneity was assessed by using the I² statistic and random effects models were employed. Sources of heterogeneity were investigated by subgroup analysis and meta-regression. All statistical analyses were conducted by Stata.ResultsA total of 23 reports involving 5397 participants were included in this systematic review. The pooled effect size for the overall mild behavioral impairment was 52% (95%CI 42-62%). In the subgroup analysis and regression analysis, we found that study type, study area, assessment tools, and study subject gender could explain part of the source of heterogeneity.ConclusionsThe results of this review suggest that 52% with mild cognitive impairment combined with mild behavioral impairment; there is a close relationship between the two. Future studies should pay more attention to the underlying mechanism between the two and provide a more scientific basis for early discrimination of clinical dementia and Alzheimer's disease.",10.1177/13872877251328712,"['Yan Zhao', 'Chang Tan', 'Yingjing Lu', 'Yingling Ge', 'Na Zhao', 'Yajie Tian', 'Liuyang Hui', 'Xiaobei Feng', 'Zihan Liu', 'Sha Li', 'Huixian Cui']",2025-Mar,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,N/A
