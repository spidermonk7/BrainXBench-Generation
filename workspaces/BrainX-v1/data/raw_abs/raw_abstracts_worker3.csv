Immobilization of KR-12 on a Titanium Alloy Surface Using Linking Arms Improves Antimicrobial Activity and Supports Osteoblast Cytocompatibility.,"Implant-associated infections pose significant challenges due to bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Recent research highlights the potential of immobilizing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) onto implants as an alternative to conventional antibiotics for the prevention of bacterial infection. While various AMP immobilization methodologies have been investigated, they lack responsiveness to biological cues. This study proposes an enzyme-responsive antimicrobial coating for orthopedic devices using KR-12, an AMP derived from Cathelicidin LL-37, coupled with the Human Elastin-Like Polypeptide (HELP) as a biomimetic and stimuli-responsive linker, while mimicking the extracellular matrix (ECM). During implantation, these customized interfaces encounter the innate immune response triggering elastase release, which degrades HELP biopolymers, enabling the controlled release of KR-12. After coupling KR-12 with HELP to titanium surfaces, the antimicrobial activity against four pathogenic bacterial strains (",10.1021/acsabm.4c01731,"['Mohadeseh Zare', 'Laura Colomina Alfaro', 'Antonella Bandiera', 'Esra Cansever Mutlu', 'David Grossin', 'Fernando Albericio', 'Sarah A Kuehne', 'Zubair Ahmed', 'Artemis Stamboulis']",2025-Mar,ACS applied bio materials,"['Humans', 'Autism Spectrum Disorder', 'Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation', 'Child', 'Male', 'Female', 'Electroencephalography', 'Nerve Net', 'Brain Waves', 'Brain', 'Connectome', 'Humans', 'Child', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cochlear Implantation', 'Hearing Loss', 'Disease Progression', 'Hearing Aids', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Male', 'Adolescent', 'Bone Conduction']"

Short-term sick leave due to epilepsy in the Swedish Prospective Regional Epilepsy Database and Biobank for Individualized Clinical Treatment (PREDICT).,"Epilepsy is associated with low socioeconomic standing and increases the risk of sick leave. Longer periods resulting in benefit payments are captured by administrative data, but the disease also entails a risk of repeated short sick leave periods, which have so far not been studied or quantified. The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of short sick leave in persons with epilepsy (PWE) and the characteristics of these PWE. A prospective multicenter study, Prospective Regional Epilepsy Database and Biobank for Individualized Clinical Treatment (PREDICT) project, based on medical records and yearly self-report questionnaires in 2020-2023. PWE from five neurology departments who were working, studying, or applying for work were included, and they reported the number of sick leave days the past year in the questionnaires. Socioeconomic data was retrieved from Statistics Sweden. Demographic and clinical factors were compared by chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, or Mann-Whitney U-test. Of the 288 included PWE, 76.4% (n = 220) stated not having stayed at home due to their epilepsy, 13.9% (n = 40) replied 1-5 days, 1.4% (n = 4) 6-10 days, and 8.3% (n = 27) >10 days. More recently diagnosed PWE reported more sick leave days. Short-term sick leave was more prevalent in those with seizures, with medication side effects, and in those with polytherapy. Demographic and socioeconomic factors did not differ between those with or without sick leave days. In the 184 participants who had replied to the questionnaire at the 1 and/or 2 years' follow-up, the distribution did not differ from the baseline report. Most PWE do not have short-term sick leave. Short-term sick leave was mainly seen in those with more difficult-to-treat or newly diagnosed epilepsy. Future studies should address if interventions like information about high-risk periods to patients and employers can improve psychosocial outcomes. Epilepsy can impact work ability, potentially leading to longer sick leaves or disability pensions, but shorter absences are less studied and are not included in the national registries in Sweden. This study explores shorter work absences in epilepsy patients attending neurology clinics in western Sweden. A quarter of patients reported missed workdays, but 68% had no sick leave recorded in national registries. Those with poorly controlled or newly diagnosed epilepsy were more likely to take sick leave, offering insights for patients, healthcare providers, and employers about managing epilepsy in the workplace.",10.1002/epi4.70029,"['Kerstin Andrén', 'David Larsson', 'Fredrik Asztély', 'Johan Zelano']",2025-Mar,Epilepsia open,"['Humans', 'Autism Spectrum Disorder', 'Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation', 'Child', 'Male', 'Female', 'Electroencephalography', 'Nerve Net', 'Brain Waves', 'Brain', 'Connectome', 'Humans', 'Child', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cochlear Implantation', 'Hearing Loss', 'Disease Progression', 'Hearing Aids', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Male', 'Adolescent', 'Bone Conduction']"

TDCS Modulates Brain Functional Networks in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Resting-State EEG Study.,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on brain functional networks in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We constructed brain functional networks using phase-locking value (PLV) and assessed the temporal variability of these networks using fuzzy entropy. Graph theory was applied to analyze network characteristics. Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) data were used to compare differences in brain functional connectivity, temporal variability, and network properties between children with ASD and typically developing (TD) children. Additionally, we examined the changes in functional connectivity, temporal variability, and network properties in children with ASD after 20 sessions of tDCS intervention. The study revealed that children with ASD exhibited lower connectivity in the alpha band and higher connectivity in the beta band. In the delta and theta bands, ASD children demonstrated a mixed pattern of both higher and lower connectivity. Furthermore, ASD children exhibited higher temporal variability across all four frequency bands, particularly in the delta and beta bands. After tDCS intervention, the total score of the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) significantly decreased. Additionally, functional connectivity in the delta and alpha bands increased, while temporal variability in the delta and beta bands decreased, indicating positive changes in brain network characteristics. These results suggest that tDCS may be a promising intervention for modulating brain functional networks in children with ASD. ChiCTR2400092790.

In vitro models of valproic acid to assess neurodevelopmental toxicity: A scoping review.,"Valproic acid (VPA) is a first-line antiseizure medication (ASM) that is highly efficacious for treating generalized and focal epilepsy disorders. Unfortunately, due to its strong association with teratogenic effects culminating in fetal valproate spectrum disorder (FVSD), which may include neurocognitive and neurobehavioral deficits, the drug has become highly regulated/restricted for women of childbearing potential. This includes those who have been shown to respond well to the drug and respond poorly to alternative ASMs. Concurrently, VPA's neurotoxic, teratogenic mechanisms have been studied in vitro, and continued research may aid in providing depth to our understanding so that superior evidence-based care plans and novel drug designs can be made for patients with epilepsy disorders. This scoping review systematically assesses what in vitro studies have discovered regarding VPA's effects on neural cells and the proposed cellular neurotoxic mechanisms. Neurotoxicity studies have captured the cytotoxic, dysmorphological, genetic, and epigenetic effects in murine and human primary, immortalized, and stem cells in vitro. This includes extensive identification of many genes and gene pathways associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, a hallmark of FVSD. Although published studies have illuminated much about VPA's neurotoxic, teratogenic effects, a lack of standardization in testing methodologies renders making direct comparisons between the results of different studies challenging. Nevertheless, the recent use of human stem cell-based models provides a richer understanding of what cellular, molecular, genetic, and epigenetic effects are caused by VPA exposure. Future in vitro studies may improve their clinical translatability by administering clinically relevant concentrations of VPA to human stem cell-derived neural cells and fostering a better understanding of VPA's neural cell type-specific and epigenetic effects. In vitro VPA neurotoxicity studies on neurodevelopment show a clear potential to provide data that may help construct superior personalized evidence-based treatment plans and novel drug designs for women of childbearing potential with epilepsy disorders.",10.1111/epi.18392,"['Daniel Sandvik', 'Elena Vianca', 'Alison Anderson', 'Muhammad Shahid Javaid', ""Terence J O'Brien"", 'Ana Antonic-Baker']",2025-Mar,Epilepsia,"['Humans', 'Autism Spectrum Disorder', 'Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation', 'Child', 'Male', 'Female', 'Electroencephalography', 'Nerve Net', 'Brain Waves', 'Brain', 'Connectome', 'Humans', 'Child', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cochlear Implantation', 'Hearing Loss', 'Disease Progression', 'Hearing Aids', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Male', 'Adolescent', 'Bone Conduction']"
Neurodegenerative and Neurodevelopmental Roles for Bulk Lipid Transporters VPS13A and BLTP2.,"Bridge-like lipid transfer proteins (BLTPs) mediate bulk lipid transport at membrane contact sites. Mutations in BLTPs are linked to both early-onset neurodevelopmental and later-onset neurodegenerative diseases, including movement disorders. The tissue specificity and temporal requirements of BLTPs in disease pathogenesis remain poorly understood. The objective of this study was to determine tissue-specific and aging-dependent roles for VPS13A and BLTP2 using Drosophila models. We generated tissue-specific knockdowns of the VPS13A ortholog (Vps13) and the BLTP2 ortholog (hobbit) in neurons and muscles of Drosophila. We analyzed age-dependent locomotor behavior, neurodegeneration, and synapse development and function. Neuron-specific loss of the VPS13A ortholog caused neurodegeneration followed by aging-dependent movement deficits and reduced lifespan, whereas muscle-specific loss affected only lifespan. In contrast, neuronal loss of the BLTP2 ortholog resulted in severe early-onset locomotor defects without neurodegeneration, whereas muscle loss impaired synaptogenesis and neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction. VPS13A maintains neuronal survival, whereas BLTP2 orchestrates synaptic development. The phenotypic specificity of BLTP function provides mechanistic insights into distinct disease trajectories for BLTP-associated disorders. © 2025 The Author(s).

Feeding style alters the growth and behavior of artificially-reared pigs.,"Early-life pig growth is influenced by protein synthesis facilitated by sow milk intake. However, factors such as teat disorders, timing of milk letdown, and seasonal fluctuations can limit milk intake, leading to slower growth and higher mortality rates. Artificial rearing systems allow precise regulation of milk intake, providing a valuable platform for researchers to investigate various feeding strategies, such as ad libitum or weight-based feeding and their impacts on behavior, growth, and health. In our study, focused on feeding style in an artificial rearing system, pigs (85 boars) were removed from the sow on postnatal day (PND) 2 and allotted to treatment based on litter of origin and body weight (BW). Pigs were reared in 4 cohorts across 2 trials over a 15-d feeding period. Experimental treatments included: AD, nutritionally adequate milk replacer provided ad libitum or PRE, nutritionally adequate milk replacer delivered at a prescribed basis according to individual pig BW, which was provided once per hour throughout a 20 h daily feeding cycle. Home-cage tracking and growth performance were measured throughout the study. On PND 6 and 14 an ethogram-based video analysis was performed, spanning the 20-h feeding cycle, to assess home-cage behavioral outcomes. Insulin responsivity was measured near study conclusion utilizing a feeding-stimulated method and static blood collection time-points. At study conclusion, pigs were euthanized and underwent body composition analysis. Data were analyzed via a repeated measures or 1-way ANOVA, with significance accepted at an alpha level of 0.05. Pigs in the AD group exhibited increased (P < 0.05) intake and BW gain but decreased feed efficiency when compared with the PRE group. Additionally, feeding style increased (P < 0.05) serum insulin concentrations 0.5 h after the first feeding in AD pigs when compared with PRE pigs. Feeding style altered (P < 0.05) spatial preference in trial 1 with PRE pigs spending relatively more time in the home-cage quadrant that housed the milk bowl compared with AD pigs. Moreover, PRE pigs spent more (P < 0.05) time visiting the feeding bowl and performing milk consumption behaviors at the bowl than AD pigs. Lastly, the relative proportion of water within soft tissue was increased (P < 0.05) in PRE pigs compared with AD pigs. In conclusion, feeding style impacted growth performance, insulin concentrations, spatial preference, and behavior of artificially-reared pigs.",10.1093/jas/skaf098,"['Kaitlyn M Sommer', 'Loretta Sutkus', 'Pradeep Senthil', 'Ryan N Dilger']",2025-Mar,Journal of animal science,"['Humans', 'Autism Spectrum Disorder', 'Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation', 'Child', 'Male', 'Female', 'Electroencephalography', 'Nerve Net', 'Brain Waves', 'Brain', 'Connectome', 'Humans', 'Child', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cochlear Implantation', 'Hearing Loss', 'Disease Progression', 'Hearing Aids', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Male', 'Adolescent', 'Bone Conduction']"
