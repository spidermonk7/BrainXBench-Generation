μSonic-hand: Biomedical micromanipulation driven by acoustic gas-liquid-solid interactions.,"Micromanipulation is crucial for operating and analyzing microobjects in advanced biomedical applications. However, safe, low-cost, multifunctional micromanipulation for operating bio-objects across scales and modalities remains inaccessible. Here, we propose a versatile micromanipulation method driven by acoustic gas-liquid-solid interactions, named μSonic-hand. The bubble contained at the end of a micropipette and the surrounding liquid form a gas-liquid multiphase system susceptible to acoustic waves. Driven by a piezoelectric transducer, the oscillating gas-liquid interface induces acoustic microstreaming, markedly increasing the mass transfer efficiency. It enables multiple liquid micromanipulations, including mixing, dispersion, enhancing cell membrane permeability, and harvesting selected cells. Furthermore, a controllable three-dimensional axisymmetric vortex in an open environment overcomes the constraints of microfluidic chip, enabling stable trapping, rapid transportation, and multidirectional rotation of HeLa cells, embryos, and other bio-objects ranging from micrometers to millimeters. A variety of applications demonstrate that the μSonic-hand, with its wide-range capabilities, inherent biocompatibility, and extremely low cost could remarkably advance biomedical science.",10.1126/sciadv.ads8167,"['Xiaoming Liu', 'Yuyang Li', 'Fengyu Liu', 'Qing Shi', 'Lixin Dong', 'Qiang Huang', 'Tatsuo Arai', 'Toshio Fukuda']",2025-Mar,Science advances,"['Humans', 'HeLa Cells', 'Gases', 'Acoustics', 'Micromanipulation', 'Animals', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices']"
Septo-hypothalamic regulation of binge-like alcohol consumption by the nociceptin system.,"High-intensity alcohol drinking during binge episodes contributes to the socioeconomic burden created by alcohol use disorders (AUDs), and nociceptin receptor (NOP) antagonists have emerged as a promising intervention. To better understand the contribution of the NOP system to binge drinking, we found that nociceptin-containing neurons of the lateral septum (LS",10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115482,"['Harold Haun', 'Raul Hernandez', 'Luzi Yan', 'Meghan Flanigan', 'Olivia Hon', 'Sophia Lee', 'Hernán Méndez', 'Alison Roland', 'Lisa Taxier', 'Thomas Kash']",2025-Mar,Cell reports,"['Humans', 'HeLa Cells', 'Gases', 'Acoustics', 'Micromanipulation', 'Animals', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices']"
Neural correlates of visual object recognition in rats.,"Invariant object recognition-the ability to recognize objects across size, rotation, or context-is fundamental for making sense of a dynamic visual world. Though traditionally studied in primates, emerging evidence suggests rodents recognize objects across a range of identity-preserving transformations. We demonstrate that rats robustly perform visual object recognition and explore a neural pathway that may underlie this capacity by developing a pipeline from high-throughput behavior training to cellular resolution imaging in awake, head-fixed animals. Leveraging our optical approach, we systematically profile neurons in primary and higher-order visual areas and their spatial organization. We find that rat visual cortex exhibits several features similar to those observed in the primate ventral stream but also marked deviations, suggesting species-specific differences in how brains solve visual object recognition. This work reinforces the sophisticated visual abilities of rats and offers the technical foundation to use them as a powerful model for mechanistic perception.",10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115461,"['Juliana Y Rhee', 'César Echavarría', 'Edward Soucy', 'Joel Greenwood', 'Javier A Masís', 'David D Cox']",2025-Mar,Cell reports,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
The value of initiating a pursuit in temporal decision-making.,"Reward-rate maximization is a prominent normative principle in behavioral ecology, neuroscience, economics, and AI. Here, we identify, compare, and analyze equations to maximize reward rate when assessing whether to initiate a pursuit. In deriving expressions for the value of a pursuit, we show that time's cost consists of both apportionment and opportunity cost. Reformulating value as a discounting function, we show precisely how a reward-rate-optimal agent's discounting function (1) combines hyperbolic and linear components reflecting apportionment and opportunity costs, and (2) is dependent not only on the considered pursuit's properties but also on time spent and rewards obtained outside the pursuit. This analysis reveals how purported signs of suboptimal behavior (hyperbolic discounting, and the Delay, Magnitude, and Sign effects) are in fact consistent with reward-rate maximization. To better account for observed decision-making errors in humans and animals, we then analyze the impact of misestimating reward-rate-maximizing parameters and find that suboptimal decisions likely stem from errors in assessing time's apportionment-specifically, underweighting time spent outside versus inside a pursuit-which we term the 'Malapportionment Hypothesis'. This understanding of the true pattern of temporal decision-making errors is essential to deducing the learning algorithms and representational architectures actually used by humans and animals.",10.7554/eLife.99957,"['Elissa Sutlief', 'Charlie Walters', 'Tanya Marton', 'Marshall G Hussain Shuler']",2025-Mar,eLife,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
Layer 6 corticocortical neurons are a major route for intra- and interhemispheric feedback.,"The neocortex comprises anatomically discrete yet interconnected areas that are symmetrically located across the two hemispheres. Determining the logic of these macrocircuits is necessary for understanding high level brain function. Here in mice, we have mapped the areal and laminar organization of the ipsi- and contralateral cortical projection onto the primary visual, somatosensory, and motor cortices. We find that although the ipsilateral hemisphere is the primary source of cortical input, there is substantial contralateral symmetry regarding the relative contribution and areal identity of input. Laminar analysis of these input areas show that excitatory Layer 6 corticocortical cells (L6 CCs) are a major projection pathway within and between the two hemispheres. Analysis of the relative contribution of inputs from supra- (feedforward) and infragranular (feedback) layers reveals that contra-hemispheric projections reflect a dominant feedback organization compared to their ipsi-cortical counterpart. The magnitude of the interhemispheric difference in hierarchy was largest for sensory and motor projection areas compared to frontal, medial, or lateral brain areas due to a proportional increase in input from L6 neurons. L6 CCs therefore not only mediate long-range cortical communication but also reflect its inherent feedback organization.",10.7554/eLife.100478,"['Simon Weiler', 'Manuel Teichert', 'Troy W Margrie']",2025-Mar,eLife,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
