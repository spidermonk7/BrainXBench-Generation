A proteolytic product, soluble TREM2 (sTREM2), is abundant in the cerebrospinal fluid and its levels positively correlate with neuronal injury markers. To gain insights into the pathological roles of sTREM2, we studied sTREM2 in the brain of 5xFAD mice, a model of AD, by direct stereotaxic injection of recombinant sTREM2 protein or by adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression. We found that sTREM2 reduces amyloid plaque load and rescues functional deficits of spatial memory and long-term potentiation. Importantly, sTREM2 enhances neuronal activity, which leads to microglial proliferation, migration, clustering in the vicinity of amyloid plaques and the uptake and degradation of A\u03b2. Depletion of microglia abolishes the neuroprotective effects of sTREM2. Our study demonstrates a protective role of sTREM2 against amyloid pathology and related toxicity and suggests that increasing sTREM2 can be explored for AD therapy.","text 2":"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a microglial surface receptor genetically linked to the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD).

We find that synaptic ribbon precursors arrive at presynaptic active zones (AZs) after afferent contacts have been established. These ribbon precursors contain the proteins RIBEYE and piccolino, tether synaptic vesicles and their delivery likely involves active, microtubule-based transport pathways. Synaptic contacts undergo a maturational transformation into multiple small AZs. This maturation is characterized by the fusion of ribbon precursors with membrane-anchored ribbons that also appear to fuse with each other. Such fusion events are most frequently encountered around P12 and hence, coincide with hearing onset in mice. Thus, these events likely underlie the morphological and functional maturation of the AZ. Moreover, the postsynaptic densities appear to undergo a similar refinement alongside presynaptic maturation.

Using information theoretic analysis and population decoding approaches, we find that orientation discriminability is luminance and contrast dependent, changing over time due to firing rate adaptation. We also show that changes in human observer orientation discrimination result directly from the dynamic range of spiking activity, which affects adaptation. Our results suggest that adaptation does not maintain information rates per se, but instead acts to keep sensory systems operating within the limited dynamic range afforded by spiking activity, despite a wide range of possible inputs.","text 2":"Sensory systems face a barrage of stimulation that continually changes along multiple dimensions.

Using information theoretic analysis and population decoding approaches, we find that orientation discriminability is luminance and contrast dependent, changing over time due to firing rate adaptation. We also show that orientation discrimination in human observers changes during adaptation, in a manner consistent with the neuronal data. Our results suggest that adaptation does not maintain information rates per se, but instead acts to keep sensory systems operating within the limited dynamic range afforded by spiking activity, despite a wide range of possible inputs.","label":"text 2"},{"text 1":"The specific contents of human consciousness rely on the activity of specialized neurons in cerebral cortex. We hypothesized that the conscious experience of a specific visual motion axis is reflected in response amplitudes of direction-selective clusters in the human motion complex. Using submillimeter fMRI at ultrahigh field (7 T) we identified fine-grained clusters that were tuned to either horizontal or vertical motion presented in an unambiguous motion display. We then recorded their responses while human observers reported the perceived axis of motion for an ambiguous apparent motion display. Although retinal stimulation remained constant, subjects reported recurring changes between horizontal and vertical motion percepts every 7 to 13 s. We found that these perceptual states were dissociatively reflected in the response amplitudes of the identified horizontal and vertical clusters. We also found that the direction of cortical depth stability in motion preferences caused the organization in a columnar fashion for responses to unambiguous motion, which then changed along the cortical surface. We suggest that activity in these specialized clusters is involved in tracking the distinct conscious experience of a particular motion axis.","text 2":"The specific contents of human consciousness rely on the activity of specialized neurons in cerebral cortex.

Although several components of the synaptic scaling apparatus have been characterized, the intrinsic regulatory mechanisms promoting scaling remain largely unknown. MicroRNAs may contribute to posttranscriptional control of mRNAs implicated in different stages of synaptic scaling, but their role in these mechanisms is still undervalued. Here, we report that chronic blockade of glutamate receptors of the AMPA and NMDA types in hippocampal neurons in culture induces changes in the neuronal mRNA and miRNA transcriptomes, leading to synaptic upscaling. Specifically, we show that synaptic activity blockade persistently down-regulates miR-186-5p. Moreover, we describe a conserved miR-186-5p-binding site within the 3'UTR of the mRNA encoding the AMPA receptor GluA2 subunit, and demonstrate that GluA2 is a direct target of miR-186-5p. Overexpression of miR-186 decreased GluA2 surface levels, increased synaptic expression of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors, and blocked synaptic scaling, whereas inhibition of miR-186-5p increased GluA2 surface levels and the amplitude and frequency of AMPA receptor-mediated currents, and mimicked excitatory synaptic scaling induced by synaptic inactivity. Our findings elucidate an activity-dependent miRNA-mediated mechanism for regulation of AMPA receptor expression.","text 2":"Homeostatic synaptic scaling is a negative feedback response to fluctuations in synaptic strength induced by developmental or learning-related processes, which maintains neuronal activity stable.

Facial proprioception may instead rely on mechanoreceptors that encode both touch and self-motion. In rodents, whisker mechanoreceptors provide a signal that informs the brain about whisker position. Whisking involves coordinated orofacial movements, so mechanoreceptors innervating facial regions other than whiskers could also provide information about whisking. To define all sources of sensory information about whisking available to the brain, we recorded spikes from mechanoreceptors innervating diverse parts of the face. Whisker motion was encoded best by whisker mechanoreceptors, but also by those innervating whisker pad hairy skin and supraorbital vibrissae.

Feature-based reinforcement learning fails when the values of individual features depend on the other features present. One solution is to assign value to multi-featural conjunctive representations. Here, we test if the hippocampus forms separable conjunctive representations that enables the learning of response contingencies for stimuli of the form: AB+, B-, AC-, C+. Pattern analyses on functional MRI data show the hippocampus forms conjunctive representations that are dissociable from feature components and that these representations, along with those of cortex, influence striatal prediction errors. Our results establish a novel role for reinforcement learning in facilitating hippocampal pattern separation and conjunctive representation.","label":"text 1"},{"text 1":"Humans can learn abstract concepts that describe invariances over relational patterns in data. One such concept, known as magnitude, allows stimuli to be compactly represented on a single dimension (i.e. on a mental line). Here, we measured representations of magnitude in humans by recording neural signals whilst they viewed symbolic numbers. During a subsequent reward-guided learning task, the neural patterns elicited by novel complex visual images reflected their payout probability in a way that suggested they were encoded onto the same mental number line, with 'bad' bandits sharing neural representation with 'small' numbers and 'good' bandits with 'large' numbers. Using neural network simulations, we provide a mechanistic model that explains our findings and shows how structural alignment can promote transfer learning. Our findings suggest that in humans, the structural alignment of value representations with neural codes for the abstract concept of magnitude drives the learning about reward probability.","text 2":"Humans can learn abstract concepts that describe invariances over relational patterns in data.

However, viruses targeting specific neuron classes have proved elusive. Here we describe viral promoters and strategies for accessing GABAergic interneurons and their molecularly defined subsets in the rodent and primate. Using a set intersection approach, which relies on two co-active promoters, we can restrict heterologous protein expression to cortical and hippocampal somatostatin-positive and parvalbumin-positive interneurons. With an orthogonal set difference method, we can enrich for subclasses of neuropeptide-Y-positive GABAergic interneurons by effectively subtracting the expression pattern of one promoter from that of another. The expansion of genetically tractable neuron classes significantly enhances the complexity of gene expression patterns in the brain.","text 2":"Viral vectors enable foreign proteins to be expressed in brains of non-genetic species, including non-human primates.

To model mutant alleles, we ablated one or both Trio alleles from excitatory neurons in the cortex and hippocampus of mice. Trio haploinsufficiency increases anxiety and impairs social preference and motor coordination. Trio loss reduces forebrain size and dendritic arborization but increases dendritic spine densities. Cortical synapses in Trio haploinsufficient mice are small, exhibit pre- and postsynaptic deficits, and cannot undergo long-term potentiation. Similar phenotypes are observed in Trio knockout mice. Overall, Trio haploinsufficiency results from severe disease-relevant deficits in behavior and neuronal structure and function. Interestingly, phosphodiesterase 4A5 (PDE4A5) levels are reduced and protein kinase A (PKA) signaling is increased when TRIO levels are reduced. Elevation of PDE4A5 and drug-based attenuation of PKA signaling rescue Trio haploinsufficiency-related dendritic spine defects, suggesting an avenue for therapeutic intervention for TRIO-related neurodevelopmental disorders.","text 2":"Heterozygous coding mutations in TRIO are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and epilepsy, and impair TRIO's biochemical activities.

We show that SorCS2 acts as sorting receptor that sustains cell surface expression of the neuronal amino acid transporter EAAT3 to facilitate import of cysteine, required for synthesis of the reactive oxygen species scavenger glutathione. Lack of SorCS2 causes depletion of EAAT3 from the plasma membrane and impairs neuronal cysteine uptake. As a consequence, SorCS2-deficient mice exhibit oxidative brain damage that coincides with enhanced neuronal cell death and increased mortality during epilepsy.

Despite well-established physiological criteria to define basal ganglia dysfunction, correlations between individual parameters and motor symptoms are often weak, challenging their predictive validity and causal contributions to behavior. One limitation is that basal ganglia pathophysiology is studied only at end-stages of depletion, leaving an impoverished understanding of when deficits emerge and how they evolve over the course of depletion. In this study, we use toxin- and neurodegeneration-induced mouse models of dopamine depletion to establish the physiological trajectory by which the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) transitions from the healthy to the diseased state. We find that physiological progression in the SNr proceeds in discrete state transitions that are highly stereotyped across models and correlate well with the prodromal and symptomatic stages of behavior.","text 2":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder whose cardinal motor symptoms are attributed to dysfunction of basal ganglia circuits under conditions of low dopamine.

Utilizing novel transgenic lines, we identified support cell populations with distinct progenitor identities. Targeted ablation of support cells reduced the number of regenerated hair cells. Furthermore, progenitors regenerated after targeted support cell ablation in the absence of hair cell damage. These populations show differences in their ability to generate new hair cells during homeostasis and regeneration.

We recorded vlPAG single-unit activity in male, Long Evans rats undergoing fear discrimination. Three 10 s auditory cues predicted unique foot shock probabilities: danger (p=1.00), uncertainty (p=0.375) and safety (p=0.00). Fear output was measured by suppression of reward seeking over the entire cue and in one-second cue intervals. Cued fear non-linearly scaled to threat probability and cue-responsive vlPAG single-units scaled their firing on one of two timescales: at onset or ramping toward shock delivery. VlPAG onset activity reflected threat probability, invariant of fear output, while ramping activity reflected both signals with threat probability prioritized.","text 2":"Faced with potential harm, individuals must estimate the probability of threat and initiate an appropriate fear response.
