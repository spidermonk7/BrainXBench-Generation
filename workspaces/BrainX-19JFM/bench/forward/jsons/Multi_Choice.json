We find that synaptic ribbon precursors arrive at presynaptic active zones (AZs) after afferent contacts have been established. These ribbon precursors contain the proteins RIBEYE and piccolino, tether synaptic vesicles and their delivery likely involves active, microtubule-based transport pathways. Synaptic contacts undergo a maturational transformation into multiple small AZs. This maturation is characterized by the fusion of ribbon precursors with membrane-anchored ribbons that also appear to fuse with each other. Such fusion events are most frequently encountered around P12 and hence, coincide with hearing onset in mice. Thus, these events likely underlie the morphological and functional maturation of the AZ. Moreover, the postsynaptic densities appear to undergo a similar refinement alongside presynaptic maturation.

Using submillimeter fMRI at ultrahigh field (7 T) we identified fine-grained clusters that were tuned to either horizontal or vertical motion presented in an unambiguous motion display. We then recorded their responses while human observers reported the perceived axis of motion for an ambiguous apparent motion display. Although retinal stimulation remained constant, subjects reported recurring changes between horizontal and vertical motion percepts every 7 to 13 s. We found that these perceptual states were dissociatively reflected in the response amplitudes of the identified horizontal and vertical clusters. We also found that responses to unambiguous motion were organized in a columnar fashion such that motion preferences were stable in the direction of cortical depth and changed when moving along the cortical surface. We suggest that activity in these specialized clusters is involved in tracking the distinct conscious experience of a particular motion axis.","label":"text4","text1_type":"Opposite_Outcome","text2_type":"Incorrect_Causal_Relationship","text3_type":"Factor_Misattribution","text4_type":"True"},{"text1":"Homeostatic synaptic scaling is a negative feedback response to fluctuations in synaptic strength induced by developmental or learning-related processes, which maintains neuronal activity stable. Although several components of the synaptic scaling apparatus have been characterized, the intrinsic regulatory mechanisms promoting scaling remain largely unknown. MicroRNAs may contribute to posttranscriptional control of mRNAs implicated in different stages of synaptic scaling, but their role in these mechanisms is still undervalued. Here, we report that chronic blockade of glutamate receptors of the AMPA and NMDA types in hippocampal neurons in culture induces changes in the neuronal mRNA and miRNA transcriptomes, leading to synaptic upscaling. Specifically, we show that synaptic activity blockade persistently down-regulates miR-186-5p. Moreover, we describe a conserved miR-186-5p-binding site within the 3'UTR of the mRNA encoding the AMPA receptor GluA2 subunit, and demonstrate that GluA2 is a direct target of miR-186-5p. Overexpression of miR-186 decreased GluA2 surface levels, decreased synaptic expression of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors, and induced synaptic scaling, whereas inhibition of miR-186-5p increased GluA2 surface levels and the amplitude and frequency of AMPA receptor-mediated currents, and mimicked excitatory synaptic scaling induced by synaptic inactivity.

Our findings reveal that active spatial exploration, a process driven by the goals of the task, takes place at the foveal scale. The scanning strategies used at this scale resemble those used when examining larger scenes, with idiosyncrasies maintained across spatial scales. These findings suggest that the visual system possesses not only a coarser priority map of the extrafoveal space to guide saccades, but also a finer-grained priority map that is used to guide microsaccades once the region of interest is foveated.","label":"text4","text1_type":"Opposite_Outcome","text2_type":"Incorrect_Causal_Relationship","text3_type":"Factor_Misattribution","text4_type":"True"},{"text1":"The ability to flexibly navigate an environment relies on a hippocampal-dependent cognitive map.

Redundant self-motion responses may provide the brain with a stable proprioceptive signal despite mechanical perturbations during active touch.","text4":"Haptic perception synthesizes touch with proprioception, the sense of body position. Humans and mice alike experience rich active touch of the face. Because most facial muscles lack proprioceptor endings, the sensory basis of facial proprioception remains unsolved. Facial proprioception may instead rely on mechanoreceptors that encode both touch and self-motion. In rodents, whisker mechanoreceptors provide a signal that informs the brain about whisker position. Whisking involves coordinated orofacial movements, so mechanoreceptors innervating facial regions other than whiskers could also provide information about whisking. To define all sources of sensory information about whisking available to the brain, we recorded spikes from mechanoreceptors innervating diverse parts of the face. Whisker motion was encoded best by whisker mechanoreceptors, but unexpectedly by thermal receptors within the skin rather than by the anticipated mechanoreceptors in the whisker pad hairy skin and supraorbital vibrissae. Redundant self-motion responses may provide the brain with a stable proprioceptive signal despite mechanical perturbations during active touch.","label":"text1","text1_type":"True","text2_type":"Opposite_Outcome","text3_type":"Incorrect_Causal_Relationship","text4_type":"Factor_Misattribution"},{"text1":"Humans and animals construct internal models of their environment in order to select appropriate courses of action.

To model mutant alleles, we ablated one or both Trio alleles from excitatory neurons in the cortex and hippocampus of mice. Trio haploinsufficiency increases anxiety and impairs social preference and motor coordination. Trio loss reduces forebrain size and dendritic arborization but increases dendritic spine densities. Cortical synapses in Trio haploinsufficient mice are small, exhibit pre- and postsynaptic deficits, and cannot undergo long-term potentiation. Similar phenotypes are observed in Trio knockout mice. Overall, Trio haploinsufficiency causes severe disease-relevant deficits in behavior and neuronal structure and function. Interestingly, phosphodiesterase 4A5 (PDE4A5) levels are reduced and protein kinase A (PKA) signaling is increased when TRIO levels are reduced.

Feature-based reinforcement learning fails when the values of individual features depend on the other features present. One solution is to assign value to multi-featural conjunctive representations. Here, we test if the hippocampus forms separable conjunctive representations that enables the learning of response contingencies for stimuli of the form: AB+, B-, AC-, C+. Pattern analyses on functional MRI data show the hippocampus forms conjunctive representations that are dissociable from feature components and that these representations, along with those of cortex, influence striatal prediction errors.
