[{"text 1":"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a microglial surface receptor genetically linked to the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). A proteolytic product, soluble TREM2 (sTREM2), is abundant in the cerebrospinal fluid and its levels positively correlate with neuronal injury markers. To gain insights into the pathological roles of sTREM2, we studied sTREM2 in the brain of 5xFAD mice, a model of AD, by direct stereotaxic injection of recombinant sTREM2 protein or by adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression. We found that sTREM2 reduces amyloid plaque load and rescues functional deficits of spatial memory and long-term potentiation. Importantly, sTREM2 enhances microglial proliferation, migration, clustering in the vicinity of amyloid plaques and the uptake and degradation of A\u03b2. Depletion of microglia abolishes the neuroprotective effects of sTREM2. Our study demonstrates a protective role of sTREM2 against amyloid pathology and related toxicity and suggests that increasing sTREM2 can be explored for AD therapy.","text 2":"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a microglial surface receptor genetically linked to the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation at postnatal day four induced lasting impairments in two distinct pathways to adult respiratory plasticity in male and female rats.

These ribbon precursors contain the proteins RIBEYE and piccolino, tether synaptic vesicles and their delivery likely involves passive, microtubule-based transport pathways. Synaptic contacts undergo a maturational transformation from multiple small to one single, large AZ. This maturation is characterized by the fusion of ribbon precursors with membrane-anchored ribbons that also appear to fuse with each other. Such fusion events are most frequently encountered around P12, thus, do not coincide with hearing onset in mice. Thus, these events likely underlie the morphological and functional maturation of the AZ. Moreover, the postsynaptic densities appear to undergo a similar refinement alongside presynaptic maturation.

However, optogenetic approaches have been limited by either low light sensitivity or slow kinetics, and lack adaptation to changes in ambient light, and not been shown to restore object vision. We find that the vertebrate medium wavelength cone opsin (MW-opsin) overcomes these limitations and supports vision in dim light. MW-opsin enables an otherwise blind retinitis pigmenotosa mouse to discriminate temporal and spatial light patterns displayed on a standard LCD computer tablet, displays adaption to changes in ambient light, and restores open-field novel object exploration under incidental room light. By contrast, rhodopsin, which is similar in sensitivity but slower in light response and has greater rundown, passes these tests.

Using information theoretic analysis and population decoding approaches, we find that orientation discriminability is luminance and contrast dependent, changing over time due to firing rate adaptation. We also show that orientation discrimination in human observers improves during adaptation, in a manner consistent with the neuronal data.

We use machine-learning-based neural decoding to learn a mapping between individual semantic features and BOLD activation patterns. The recorded brain patterns are best decoded using a combination of not only the three semantic features that were in fact presented as clues, but a far richer set of semantic features typically linked to the target object. We conclude that our experimental protocol allowed us to demonstrate that fragmented information is combined into a complete semantic representation of an object and to identify brain regions associated with object meaning.","label":"text 2"},{"text 1":"The emergence of new and increasingly sophisticated behaviors after birth is accompanied by dramatic increase of newly established synaptic connections in the nervous system.

The negative effects on learning are evidenced by enhanced task acquisition on subsequent practice days even in the absence of fatigue.

In a series of experiments, we describe how muscle fatigue, defined as degradation of maximum force after exertion, impairs motor-skill learning beyond its effects on task execution. The negative effects on learning are evidenced by impaired task acquisition on subsequent practice days even in the absence of fatigue.

During a subsequent reward-guided learning task, the neural patterns elicited by novel complex visual images reflected their payout probability in a way that suggested they were encoded onto the same mental number line, with 'bad' bandits sharing neural representation with 'small' numbers and 'good' bandits with 'large' numbers. Using neural network simulations, we provide a mechanistic model that explains our findings and shows how structural alignment can promote transfer learning. Our findings demonstrate that in humans, learning about reward probability is accompanied by structural disalignment of value representations with neural codes for the abstract concept of magnitude.","label":"text 1"},{"text 1":"Viral vectors enable foreign proteins to be expressed in brains of non-genetic species, including non-human primates.

We recorded vlPAG single-unit activity in male, Long Evans rats undergoing fear discrimination. Three 10 s auditory cues predicted unique foot shock probabilities: danger (p=1.00), uncertainty (p=0.375) and safety (p=0.00). Fear output was measured by suppression of reward seeking over the entire cue and in one-second cue intervals. Cued fear non-linearly scaled to threat probability and cue-responsive vlPAG single-units scaled their firing on one of two timescales: at onset or ramping toward shock delivery.
