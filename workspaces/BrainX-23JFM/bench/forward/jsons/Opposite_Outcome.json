[{"text 1":"Monosynaptic tracing using rabies virus is an important technique in neuroscience, allowing brain-wide labeling of neurons directly presynaptic to a targeted neuronal population. A 2017 article reported the development of a noncytotoxic version-a major advance-based on attenuating the rabies virus by the addition of a destabilization domain to the C terminus of a viral protein. However, this modification did not appear to hinder the ability of the virus to spread between neurons. We analyzed two viruses provided by the authors and show here that both were mutants that had lost the intended modification, explaining the paper's paradoxical results. We then made a virus that actually did have the intended modification in at least the majority of virions and found that it did not spread efficiently under the conditions described in the original paper, namely, without an exogenous protease being expressed in order to remove the destabilization domain. We found that it did spread when the protease was supplied, although this also appeared to result in the deaths of most source cells by 3 wk postinjection. We conclude that the new approach is not robust but that it could become a viable technique given further optimization and validation.","text 2":"Monosynaptic tracing using rabies virus is an important technique in neuroscience, allowing brain-wide labeling of neurons directly presynaptic to a targeted neuronal population.

Ketamine is thought to act via NMDA receptors and HCN1 channels to produce brain oscillations that are related to these effects. Using human intracranial recordings, we found that ketamine produces gamma oscillations in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, structures previously implicated in ketamine's antidepressant effects, and a 3\u2009Hz oscillation in posteromedial cortex, previously proposed as a mechanism for its dissociative effects. We analyzed oscillatory changes after subsequent propofol administration, whose GABAergic activity antagonizes ketamine's NMDA-mediated disinhibition, alongside a shared HCN1 inhibitory effect, to identify dynamics attributable to NMDA-mediated disinhibition versus HCN1 inhibition. Our results suggest that ketamine engages different neural circuits in distinct frequency-dependent patterns of activity to reduce its antidepressant and dissociative sensory effects.

Nevertheless, it is not well understood how such synchrony is achieved and maintained in a complex network of time-delayed neural interactions. Myelin plasticity, accomplished by oligodendrocytes (OLs), has been suggested as an efficient mechanism for controlling timing in brain communications through adaptive changes of axonal conduction velocity and consequently conduction time delays, or latencies; however, local rules and feedback mechanisms that OLs use to achieve synchronization are not known. We propose a mathematical model of oligodendrocyte-mediated myelin plasticity (OMP) in which OLs play an active role in providing such feedback. This is achieved without using arrival times at the synapse or modulatory signaling from astrocytes; instead, it relies on the presence of global and transient OL responses to local action potentials in the axons they myelinate. While inspired by OL morphology, we provide the theoretical underpinnings that motivated the model and explore its performance for a wide range of its parameters. Our results indicate that when the characteristic time of OL's transient intracellular responses to neural spikes is between 10 and 40 ms and the firing rates in individual axons are relatively low (10 Hz), the OMP model disrupts correlation and time-locked signals while latencies in axons carrying independent signals are unaffected.

In a comprehensive, within-subjects, placebo-controlled design, we acquired multimodal neuroimaging [i.e., EEG-fMRI\u00a0(electroencephalography-functional MRI)] data to assess the effects of intravenous (IV) N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) on brain function in 20 healthy volunteers. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI was acquired prior to, during, and after a bolus IV administration of 20 mg DMT, and, separately, placebo. At dosages consistent with the present study, DMT, a serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) agonist, induces a deeply immersive and radically altered state of consciousness. DMT is thus a useful research tool for probing the neural correlates of conscious experience. Here, fMRI results revealed robust increases in global functional connectivity (GFC), network disintegration and desegregation, and a compression of the principal cortical gradient under DMT.

At dosages consistent with the present study, DMT, a serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) agonist, induces a deeply immersive and radically altered state of consciousness. DMT is thus a useful research tool for probing the neural correlates of conscious experience. In a comprehensive, within-subjects, placebo-controlled design, we acquired multimodal neuroimaging [i.e., EEG-fMRI\u00a0(electroencephalography-functional MRI)] data to assess the effects of intravenous (IV) N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) on brain function in 20 healthy volunteers. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI was acquired prior to, during, and after a bolus IV administration of 20 mg DMT, and, separately, placebo. Here, fMRI results revealed robust increases in global functional connectivity (GFC), network disintegration and desegregation, and a compression of the principal cortical gradient under DMT.

With a sample of 1,165 individuals aged 40 to 94, we analyze population differences in cross-sectional rates of decline in BV with age. We also assess the relationships of BV with energy biomarkers and arterial disease and compare them against findings in industrialized contexts. The analyses test three hypotheses derived from an evolutionary model of brain health, which we call the embarrassment of riches (EOR). The model hypothesizes that food energy was positively associated with late life BV in the physically active, food-limited past, but excess body mass and adiposity are now associated with reduced BV in industrialized societies in middle and older ages. We find that the relationship of BV with both non-HDL cholesterol and body mass index is curvilinear, positive from the lowest values to 1.4 to 1.6 SDs above the mean, and negative from that value to the highest values.

In the present study, we systematically evaluated the efficacy of two NOPR agonists, Ro64-6198 and SR16835, on sleep\/wake in rats, mice, and Cynomolgus macaques.

At the highest dose tested in rats, the decrease in NREM sleep and EEG SWA was accompanied by a prolonged inhibition of REM sleep, hypothermia, and reduced locomotor activity. However, even at the highest dose tested, rats were immediately arousable upon sensory stimulation, suggesting sleep rather than an anesthetic state. NOPR agonism also resulted in increased expression of c-Fos in the anterodorsal preoptic and parastrial nuclei, two GABAergic nuclei that are highly interconnected with brain regions involved in physiological regulation. These results suggest that the N\/OFQ-NOPR system may have a previously unrecognized role in sleep\/wake control and potential promise as a therapeutic target for the treatment of insomnia.","text 2":"Sleep\/wake control involves several neurotransmitter and neuromodulatory systems yet the coordination of the behavioral and physiological processes underlying sleep is incompletely understood.

The model recreates the biological connectivity of these neurons, and simulations of the model reproduce multiple experimental findings in different brain states.

All dexterity measures in both groups showed post-training improvement, although finger extension exhibited inferior dexterity. Surprisingly, learning of finger extension generalized to the untrained flexion direction, but not vice versa. This flexion bias was also evident in the untrained hand. Our study indicates direction-specific control circuits for learning of finger flexion and extension that interact by partially, but asymmetrically, transferring between directions.","label":"text 2"},{"text 1":"The ability to abstract information to guide decisions during navigation across changing environments is essential for adaptation and requires the integrity of the hippocampal-prefrontal circuitry. The hippocampus encodes navigational information in a cognitive map, but it remains unclear how cognitive maps are transformed across hippocampal-prefrontal circuits to support abstraction and generalization. Here, we simultaneously record hippocampal-prefrontal ensembles as rats generalize navigational rules across distinct environments. We find that, whereas hippocampal representational maps maintain specificity of separate environments, prefrontal maps generalize across environments. Furthermore, while both maps are structured within a neural manifold of population activity, they have distinct representational geometries. Prefrontal geometry enables abstraction of rule-informative variables, a representational format that generalizes to novel conditions of existing variable classes. Hippocampal geometry lacks such abstraction. Together, these findings elucidate how cognitive maps are structured into distinct geometric representations to support abstraction and generalization while maintaining memory specificity.","text 2":"The ability to abstract information to guide decisions during navigation across changing environments is essential for adaptation and requires the integrity of the hippocampal-prefrontal circuitry.

The subjects' choices and reaction times for perceptual decisions and uncertainty responses are measured, respectively. We then build a value-based model in which decisions are based on optimizing value computed from a drift-diffusion process. The model accounts for key features of subjects' behavior and the variation across the individuals. It explains how the omission of the uncertainty option affects perceptual decision making.

Here, we used two distinct motor tasks to dissociate dopamine's acute motoric effects vs. its long-lasting, learning-mediated effects. In dopamine-depleted mice, motor task performance gradually worsened with task exposure. Task experience was critical, as mice that remained in the home cage during the same period were relatively unimpaired when subsequently probed on the task.
