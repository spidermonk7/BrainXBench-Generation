In contrast, ALS-associated mutations are primarily located at the C-terminal cargo-binding tail domain and the typical ALS cases displayed an extended survival relative to patients harboring loss-of-function mutations.

We conclude that resonance with subthreshold oscillations provides a plausible network-level mechanism to accurately encode and retrieve information without overstrengthening connections between neurons.","text4":"Network oscillations across and within brain areas are critical for learning and performance of memory tasks. While a large amount of work has focused on the generation of neural oscillations, their effect on neuronal populations' spiking activity and information encoding is less known. Here, we use computational modeling to demonstrate that a shift in resonance responses can interact with oscillating input to ensure that networks of neurons properly encode new information represented in external inputs to the weights of recurrent synaptic connections. Using a neuronal network model, we find that due to an input current-dependent shift in their resonance response, individual neurons in a network will arrange their phases of firing to represent varying strengths of their respective inputs. We also demonstrate that sequential patterns of neuronal firing can be accurately stored in the network; these sequences are later reproduced without external input (in the context of subthreshold oscillations) in both the forward and reverse directions (as has been observed following learning in vivo). To test whether a similar mechanism could act in vivo, we show that periodic stimulation of hippocampal neurons coordinates network activity and functional connectivity in a frequency-dependent manner. As networks encode information, neurons fire more synchronously, which in turn limits the suppression of subthreshold oscillations needed for effective learning. This suggests that overstrengthening connections between neurons may occur if resonance mechanisms are improperly balanced.","label":"text1","text1_type":"True","text2_type":"Factor_Misattribution","text3_type":"Opposite_Outcome","text4_type":"Incorrect_Causal_Relationship"},{"text1":"Dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) regulate motivated behavior, but the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain unresolved.

We recorded 81 HD cells in a cue-rich environment, and evoked spikes trains outside of their preferred direction (distance range, 11-178\u00b0). We found that HD tuning was remarkably susceptible to activity manipulations. Even strong stimulations, which induced seconds-long spike trains, caused a noticeable shift in directional tuning. HD tuning curves before and after stimulation exhibited weak correlation, indicating that postsynaptic activation alone is sufficient for modifying HD output. Our data are thus consistent with the predicted stability of an HD attractor network when anchored to external landmarks. A small spiking bias at the stimulus direction could only be observed in a visually deprived environment in which both average firing rates and directional tuning were markedly reduced. Based on this evidence, we speculate that, when attractor dynamics become unstable (e.g., under disorientation), the output of HD neurons could be more efficiently controlled by strong biasing stimuli.","label":"text2","text1_type":"Incorrect_Causal_Relationship","text2_type":"True","text3_type":"Factor_Misattribution","text4_type":"Opposite_Outcome"},{"text1":"Acute influenza infection has been reported to be associated with neurological symptoms. However, the long-term consequences of an infection with neurotropic and non-neurotropic influenza A virus (IAV) variants for the CNS remain elusive. We can show that spine loss in the hippocampus after infection with neurotropic H7N7 (rSC35M) and non-neurotropic H3N2 (maHK68) in female C57BL\/6 mice persists well beyond the acute phase of the disease. Although spine number was significantly reduced at 30 d postinfection (dpi) with H7N7 or H3N2, full recovery could only be observed much later at 120 dpi. Infection with H1N1 virus, which was shown previously to affect spine number and hippocampus-dependent learning acutely, had no significant long-term effects. Spine loss was associated with an increase in the number of activated microglia, reduced long-term potentiation in the hippocampus, and impairment in spatial memory formation, indicating that IAV-associated inflammation induced functional and structural alterations in hippocampal networks. Transcriptome analyses revealed regulation of many inflammatory and neuron- and glia-specific genes in H3N2- and H7N7-infected mice at day 18 and in H7N7-infected mice at day 30 pi that related to the structural and functional alterations. Our data provide evidence that neuroinflammation induced by neurotropic H7N7 and infection of the lung with a non-neurotropic H3N2 IAV result in long-term impairments in the CNS. IAV infection in humans may therefore not only lead to short-term responses in infected organs, but may also trigger neuroinflammation and associated chronic alterations in the CNS.","text2":"Acute influenza infection has been reported to be associated with neurological symptoms.

Moreover, brain-to-brain coupling in this network was found to correlate with analgesia magnitude and observer's empathic accuracy. These findings indicate that brain-to-brain coupling may be involved in touch-related analgesia.","label":"text4","text1_type":"Factor_Misattribution","text2_type":"Opposite_Outcome","text3_type":"Incorrect_Causal_Relationship","text4_type":"True"},{"text1":"Social impairments are a hallmark of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), but empirical evidence for early brain network alterations in response to social stimuli is scant in ASD.

Currently, exposure therapy is among the most effective treatments for anxiety disorders, but this intervention is subjectively aversive to patients, causing many to drop out of treatment prematurely. Here we introduce a method to bypass the subjective unpleasantness in conscious exposure, by directly pairing monetary reward with unconscious occurrences of decoded representations of naturally feared animals in the brain. To decode physiological fear representations without triggering excessively aversive reactions, we capitalize on recent advancements in functional magnetic resonance imaging decoding techniques, and use a method called hyperalignment to infer the relevant representations of feared animals for a designated participant based on data from other 'surrogate' participants. In this way, the procedure completely bypasses the need for a conscious encounter with feared animals. We demonstrate that our method can lead to unreliable reductions in physiological fear responses, as measured by skin conductance as well as amygdala hemodynamic activity. Not only do these results raise the intriguing possibility that naturally occurring fear responses can be 'reprogrammed' outside of conscious awareness, importantly, they also create the rare opportunity to rigorously test a psychological intervention of this nature in a double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion. This may pave the way for a new approach combining the appealing rationale and proven efficacy of conventional psychotherapy with the rigor and leverage of clinical neuroscience.","text2":"Can 'hardwired' physiological fear responses (e.g., for spiders and snakes) be reprogramed unconsciously in the human brain?

Moreover, the HDAC6 interaction differs from Nrp1 interaction among GlyRS mutants and correlates with divergent clinical presentations, indicating the existence of multiple and different mechanisms in CMT2D.","label":"text2","text1_type":"Opposite_Outcome","text2_type":"True","text3_type":"Factor_Misattribution","text4_type":"Incorrect_Causal_Relationship"},{"text1":"The neuromodulator serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in a variety of functions that involve patience or impulse control.
