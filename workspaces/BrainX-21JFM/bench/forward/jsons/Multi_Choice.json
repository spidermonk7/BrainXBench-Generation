In analyzing the available stopping experimental code and data, we identified a set of design issues that we believe significantly compromise its value. These issues include but are not limited to variable stimulus durations that violate basic assumptions of dominant stopping models, trials in which stimuli are incorrectly not presented, and faulty stop-signal delays. We present eight issues, show their effect on the existing ABCD data, suggest prospective solutions including task changes for future data collection and preliminary computational models, and suggest retrospective solutions for data users who wish to make the most of the existing data.","label":"text4","text1_type":"Incorrect_Causal_Relationship","text2_type":"Factor_Misattribution","text3_type":"Opposite_Outcome","text4_type":"True"},{"text1":"Callosal projections from primary somatosensory cortex (S1) are key for processing somatosensory inputs and integrating sensory-motor information.

Here, using the NetBID2 algorithm and developing human brain RNA sequencing dataset, we identify synaptotagmin-like 3 (SYTL3) as one of the top drivers of early human brain development. Interestingly, SYTL3 exhibits high activity but low expression in both early developmental human cortex and human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived neurons. Knockout of SYTL3 (SYTL3-KO) in human neurons or knockdown of Sytl3 in embryonic mouse cortex markedly promotes neuronal migration.

After osmotic stress-enforced cell swelling or shrinkage, the cells regulate intracellular osmolality to recover their volume. However, the mechanisms recognizing osmotic stress remain obscured. We previously clarified that apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 3 (ASK3) bidirectionally responds to osmotic stress and regulates cell volume recovery. Here, we show that macromolecular crowding induces liquid-demixing condensates of ASK3 under hyperosmotic stress, which transduce osmosensing signal into ASK3 inactivation. A genome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen identifies an ASK3 inactivation regulator, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), related to poly(ADP-ribose) signaling. Furthermore, we clarify that poly(ADP-ribose) destabilizes ASK3 condensates in the liquid phase and enables ASK3 to become activated under hyperosmotic stress.

We estimate the internal saccade representation through pre- and trans-saccadic target localization, showing that it decouples from the actual saccade during learning. We present a model that explains motor and perceptual changes by collective plasticity of spatial target percept, motor command, and a forward dynamics model that transforms CD from motor into visuospatial coordinates. We show that learning does not follow visual prediction error but instead a postdictive update of space after saccade landing.

In patient brains with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)\/frontotemporal dementia (FTD), aggregation of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 constitutes a major component of aberrant cytoplasmic inclusions. We identify a pathological signaling cascade whereby reactive nitrogen species cause S-nitrosylation of TDP-43 (forming SNO-TDP-43) to facilitate disulfide linkage and consequent TDP-43 aggregation. Similar pathological SNO-TDP-43 levels occur in postmortem human FTD\/ALS brains and in cell-based models, including human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons. Aggregated TDP-43 triggers additional nitrosative stress, representing positive feed forward leading to further SNO-TDP-43 formation and disulfide-linked oligomerization\/aggregation. Critically, we show that calcium imbalances facilitate cell spreading in vivo and interfere with the TDP-43 RNA-binding activity, affecting SNMT1 and phospho-(p)CREB levels, thus contributing to neuronal damage in ALS\/FTD disorders.","text3":"Rare genetic mutations result in aggregation and spreading of cognate proteins in neurodegenerative disorders; however, in the absence of mutation (i.e., in the vast majority of \"sporadic\" cases), mechanisms for protein misfolding\/aggregation remain largely unknown.

By using a mutant \u03b1-synuclein selective-overexpression mouse model of prodromal PD, we identified a cell-autonomous selective Kv4 channelopathy in dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) neurons. This functional remodeling of intact DMV neurons leads to impaired pacemaker function in vitro and in vivo, which, in turn, reduces gastrointestinal motility, a common early symptom of prodromal PD.

Compared to wild-type (WT) mice, Mertk-knockout (KO) mice show impaired clearance of myelin debris and remyelination following demyelination. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterize Mertk-influenced responses to cuprizone-mediated demyelination and remyelination across different cell types. Mertk-KO brains show an attenuated microglial response to demyelination but a decreased proportion of interferon (IFN)-responsive microglia. In addition, we identify a transcriptionally distinct subtype of surviving oligodendrocytes specific to demyelinated lesions. The inhibitory effect of myelin debris on remyelination is mediated in part by IFN\u03b3, which further impedes microglial clearance of myelin debris and inhibits oligodendrocyte differentiation.
