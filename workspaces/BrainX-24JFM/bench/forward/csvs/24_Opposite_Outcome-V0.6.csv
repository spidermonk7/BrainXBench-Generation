"Disease-modifying therapies (DMT) administered to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) can influence immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and vaccine efficacy. However, data on the detailed phenotypic, functional and metabolic characteristics of antigen (Ag)-specific cells following the third dose of mRNA vaccine remain scarce. Here, using flow cytometry and 45-parameter mass cytometry, we broadly investigate the phenotype, function and the single-cell metabolic profile of SARS-CoV-2-specific T and B cells up to 8 months after the third dose of mRNA vaccine in a cohort of 94 patients with MS treated with different DMT, including cladribine, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, interferon, natalizumab, teriflunomide, rituximab or ocrelizumab. Almost all patients display functional immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Different metabolic profiles characterize antigen-specific-T and -B cell response in fingolimod- and natalizumab-treated patients, whose immune response differs from all the other MS treatments.","Disease-modifying therapies (DMT) administered to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) can influence immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and vaccine efficacy.

"The defining feature of Parkinson disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (Asyn) fibrils in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Here we develop and validate a method to amplify Asyn fibrils extracted from LBD postmortem tissue samples and use solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) studies to determine atomic resolution structure. Amplified LBD Asyn fibrils comprise a mixture of single protofilament and two protofilament fibrils with very low twist. The protofilament fold is highly similar to the fold determined by a recent cryo-electron microscopy study for a minority population of twisted single protofilament fibrils extracted from LBD tissue. These results expand the structural characterization of LBD Asyn fibrils and approaches for studying disease mechanisms, imaging agents and therapeutics targeting Asyn.","The defining feature of Parkinson disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (Asyn) fibrils in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites.

"Contextual embeddings, derived from deep language models (DLMs), provide a continuous vectorial representation of language. This embedding space differs fundamentally from the symbolic representations posited by traditional psycholinguistics. We hypothesize that language areas in the human brain, similar to DLMs, rely on a continuous embedding space to represent language. To test this hypothesis, we densely record the neural activity patterns in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) of three participants using dense intracranial arrays while they listened to a 30-minute podcast. From these fine-grained spatiotemporal neural recordings, we derive a continuous vectorial representation for each word (i.e., a brain embedding) in each patient. Using stringent zero-shot mapping we demonstrate that brain embeddings in the IFG and the DLM contextual embedding space have common geometric patterns. The common geometric patterns allow us to predict the brain embedding in IFG of a given left-out word based solely on its geometrical relationship to other non-overlapping words in the podcast. Furthermore, we show that static word embeddings capture the geometry of IFG embeddings better than contextual embeddings. The continuous brain embedding space exposes a vector-based neural code for natural language processing in the human brain.","Contextual embeddings, derived from deep language models (DLMs), provide a continuous vectorial representation of language.

"The physical body of an organism serves as a vital interface for interactions with its environment. Here, we investigated the impact of human body size on the perception of action possibilities (affordances) offered by the environment. We found that the body size delineated a distinct boundary on affordances, dividing objects of continuous real-world sizes into two discrete categories with each affording distinct action sets. Additionally, the boundary shifted with imagined body sizes, suggesting a causal link between body size and affordance perception. Intriguingly, ChatGPT, a large language model lacking physical embodiment, exhibited a modest yet comparable affordance boundary at the scale of human body size, suggesting the boundary is not exclusively derived from organism-environment interactions. A subsequent fMRI experiment offered preliminary evidence of affordance processing exclusively for objects within the body size range, but not for those beyond. This suggests that only objects capable of being manipulated are the objects capable of offering affordance in the eyes of an organism. In summary, our study suggests a novel definition of object-ness in an affordance-based context, advocating the concept of embodied cognition in understanding the emergence of intelligence constrained by an organism's physical attributes.","The physical body of an organism serves as a vital interface for interactions with its environment.

"Grid firing fields have been proposed as a neural substrate for spatial localisation in general or for path integration in particular. To distinguish these possibilities, we investigate firing of grid and non-grid cells in the mouse medial entorhinal cortex during a location memory task. We find that grid firing can either be anchored to the task environment, or can encode distance travelled independently of the task reference frame. Anchoring varied between and within sessions, while spatial firing of non-grid cells was either coherent with the grid population, or was stably anchored to the task environment. We took advantage of the variability in task-anchoring to evaluate whether and when encoding of location by grid cells might contribute to behaviour. We find that when reward location is indicated by a visual cue, performance is impaired when grid cells are task-anchored, arguing against a role for grid representations when location cues are available. By contrast, in the absence of the visual cue, performance was enhanced when grid cells were anchored to the task environment. Our results suggest that anchoring of grid cells to task reference frames selectively enhances performance when path integration is required.","Grid firing fields have been proposed as a neural substrate for spatial localisation in general or for path integration in particular.

"In 2015, we launched the mesoSPIM initiative, an open-source project for making light-sheet microscopy of large cleared tissues more accessible. Meanwhile, the demand for imaging larger samples at higher speed and resolution has increased, requiring major improvements in the capabilities of such microscopes. Here, we introduce the next-generation mesoSPIM (""Benchtop"") with a significantly increased field of view, improved resolution, higher throughput, more affordable cost, and simpler assembly compared to the original version. We develop an optical method for testing detection objectives that enables us to select objectives optimal for light-sheet imaging with large-sensor cameras. The improved mesoSPIM achieves low spatial resolution (1.5 µm laterally, 3.3 µm axially) across the entire field of view, magnification up to 20×, and supports sample sizes ranging from sub-mm up to several centimeters while being compatible with multiple clearing techniques. The microscope serves a broad range of applications in neuroscience, developmental biology, pathology, and even physics.","In 2015, we launched the mesoSPIM initiative, an open-source project for making light-sheet microscopy of large cleared tissues more accessible.

"Even after successful extinction, conditioned fear can return. Strengthening the consolidation of the fear-inhibitory safety memory formed during extinction is one way to counteract return of fear. In a previous study, we found that post-extinction L-DOPA administration improved extinction memory retrieval 24 h later. Furthermore, spontaneous post-extinction reactivations of a neural activation pattern evoked in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during extinction predicted extinction memory retrieval, L-DOPA increased the number of these reactivations, and this mediated the effect of L-DOPA on extinction memory retrieval. Here, we conducted a preregistered replication study of this work in healthy male participants. We confirm that spontaneous post-extinction vmPFC reactivations predict extinction memory retrieval. This predictive effect, however, was only observed 90 min after extinction, and was not statistically significant at 45 min as in the discovery study. In contrast to our previous study, we find no evidence that L-DOPA administration significantly enhances retrieval and that this is mediated by enhancement of the number of vmPFC reactivations. However, additional non-preregistered analyses reveal a beneficial effect of L-DOPA on extinction retrieval when controlling for the trait-like stable baseline levels of salivary alpha-amylase enzymatic activity. Further, trait salivary alpha-amylase negatively predicts retrieval, and this effect is reduced by L-DOPA treatment. Importantly, the latter findings result from non-preregistered analyses and thus further investigation is needed.","Even after successful extinction, conditioned fear can return.

"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in maintaining cell homeostasis and function. However, it remains largely unknown whether and how neuronal activity impacts the transcriptional regulation of lncRNAs, or if this leads to synapse-related changes and contributes to the formation of long-term memories. Here, we report the identification of a lncRNA, SLAMR, which becomes enriched in CA1-hippocampal neurons upon contextual fear conditioning but not in CA3 neurons. SLAMR is transported along dendrites via the molecular motor KIF5C and is recruited to the synapse upon stimulation. Loss of function of SLAMR reduces dendritic complexity and impairs activity-dependent changes in spine structural plasticity and translation. Gain of function of SLAMR, in contrast, enhances dendritic complexity, spine density, and translation. Analyses of the SLAMR interactome reveal its association with CaMKIIα protein through a 220-nucleotide element also involved in SLAMR transport. A CaMKII reporter reveals a basal reduction in CaMKII activity with SLAMR loss-of-function. Furthermore, the selective loss of SLAMR function in CA1 disrupts the consolidation of fear memory in male mice, without affecting their acquisition, recall, or extinction, or spatial memory. Together, these results provide new molecular and functional insight into activity-dependent changes at the synapse and consolidation of contextual fear.","Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in maintaining cell homeostasis and function.

"We have previously identified a network of higher-order brain regions particularly vulnerable to the ageing process, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. However, it remains unknown what the genetic influences on this fragile brain network are, and whether it can be altered by the most common modifiable risk factors for dementia. Here, in ~40,000 UK Biobank participants, we first show significant genome-wide associations between this brain network and seven genetic clusters implicated in cardiovascular deaths, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and with the two antigens of the XG blood group located in the pseudoautosomal region of the sex chromosomes. We further reveal that the most deleterious modifiable risk factors for this vulnerable brain network are diabetes, nitrogen dioxide - a proxy for traffic-related air pollution - and alcohol intake frequency. The extent of these associations was uncovered by examining these modifiable risk factors in a single model to assess the unique contribution of each on the vulnerable brain network, above and beyond the dominating effects of age and sex. These results provide a comprehensive picture of the role played by genetic and modifiable risk factors on these fragile parts of the brain.","We have previously identified a network of higher-order brain regions particularly vulnerable to the ageing process, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.

"The cell-type-specific expression of ligand/receptor and cell-adhesion molecules is a fundamental mechanism through which neurons regulate connectivity. Here, we determine a functional relevance of the long-established mutually exclusive expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit and the trans-membrane protein Kit Ligand by discrete populations of neurons in the mammalian brain. Kit is enriched in molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) of the cerebellar cortex (i.e., stellate and basket cells), while cerebellar Kit Ligand is selectively expressed by a target of their inhibition, Purkinje cells (PCs). By in vivo genetic manipulation spanning embryonic development through adulthood, we demonstrate that PC Kit Ligand and MLI Kit are required for, and capable of driving changes in, the inhibition of PCs. Collectively, these works in mice demonstrate that the Kit Ligand/Kit receptor dyad sustains mammalian central synapse function and suggest a rationale for the affiliation of Kit mutation with neurodevelopmental disorders.","The cell-type-specific expression of ligand/receptor and cell-adhesion molecules is a fundamental mechanism through which neurons regulate connectivity.

"Psychological therapies are among the most effective treatments for common mental health problems-however, we still know relatively little about how exactly they improve symptoms. Here, we demonstrate the power of combining theory with computational methods to parse effects of different components of cognitive-behavioral therapies onto underlying mechanisms. Specifically, we present data from a series of randomized-controlled experiments testing the effects of brief components of behavioral and cognitive therapies on different cognitive processes, using well-validated behavioral measures and associated computational models. A goal setting intervention, based on behavioral activation therapy activities, reliably and selectively increased sensitivity to effort when deciding how to act to gain reward. By contrast, a cognitive restructuring intervention, based on cognitive therapy materials, reliably and selectively reduced the tendency to attribute negative everyday events to self-related causes. The effects of each intervention were specific to these respective measures. Our approach provides a basis for beginning to understand how different elements of common psychotherapy programs may work.","Psychological therapies are among the most effective treatments for common mental health problems-however, we still know relatively little about how exactly they improve symptoms.

"Reinforcement learning (RL) is thought to underlie the acquisition of vocal skills like birdsong and speech, where sounding like one's ""tutor"" is rewarding. However, what RL strategy generates the rich sound inventories for song or speech? We find that the standard actor-critic model of birdsong learning fails to explain juvenile zebra finches' efficient learning of multiple syllables. However, when we replace a single actor with multiple independent actors that jointly maximize a common intrinsic reward, then birds' empirical learning trajectories are accurately reproduced. The influence of each actor (syllable) on the magnitude of global reward is competitively determined by its acoustic similarity to target syllables. This leads to each actor matching the target it is closest to and, occasionally, to the competitive exclusion of an actor from the learning process (i.e., the learned song). We propose that a competitive-cooperative multi-actor RL (MARL) algorithm is key for the efficient learning of the action inventory of a complex skill.","Reinforcement learning (RL) is thought to underlie the acquisition of vocal skills like birdsong and speech, where sounding like one's 'tutor' is rewarding.

We show, however, that neural activity is neither sufficient nor necessary to produce such results. We use a combination of control conditions and simulations to demonstrate that DIANA signals can arise from nonideal aspects of the pulse sequence and specimen that help determine spatiotemporal characteristics of the data.

Extensively averaged data involving 1050 trials in six mice showed a flat baseline and no detectable neuronal activity-like fMRI peak. However, spurious, nonreplicable peaks were found when using a small number of trials, and artifactual peaks were detected when some outlier-like trials were excluded. Further, no detectable DIANA peak was observed in the BOLD-responding thalamus from the selected trials with the neuronal activity-like reference function in the barrel cortex.

"Asymmetry between the left and right hemisphere is a key feature of brain organization. Hemispheric functional specialization underlies some of the most advanced human-defining cognitive operations, such as articulated language, perspective taking, or rapid detection of facial cues. Yet, genetic investigations into brain asymmetry have mostly relied on common variants, which typically exert small effects on brain-related phenotypes. Here, we leverage rare genomic deletions and duplications to study how genetic alterations reverberate in human brain and behavior. We designed a pattern-learning approach to dissect the impact of eight high-effect-size copy number variations (CNVs) on brain asymmetry in a multi-site cohort of 552 CNV carriers and 290 non-carriers. Isolated multivariate brain asymmetry patterns spotlighted regions typically thought to subserve lateralized functions, including language, hearing, as well as visual, face and word recognition. Planum temporale asymmetry emerged as especially resistant to deletions and duplications of specific gene sets. Targeted analysis of common variants through genome-wide association study (GWAS) consolidated partly diverging genetic influences on the right versus left planum temporale structure. In conclusion, our gene-brain-behavior data fusion highlights the consequences of genetically controlled brain lateralization on uniquely human cognitive capacities.","Asymmetry between the left and right hemisphere is a key feature of brain organization.

"Storing and accessing memories is required to successfully perform day-to-day tasks, for example for engaging in a meaningful conversation. Previous studies in both rodents and primates have correlated hippocampal cellular activity with behavioral expression of memory. A key role has been attributed to awake hippocampal replay - a sequential reactivation of neurons representing a trajectory through space. However, it is unclear if awake replay impacts immediate future behavior, gradually creates and stabilizes long-term memories over a long period of time (hours and longer), or enables the temporary memorization of relevant events at an intermediate time scale (seconds to minutes). In this study, we aimed to address the uncertainty around the timeframe of impact of awake replay by collecting causal evidence from behaving rats. We detected and disrupted sharp wave ripples (SWRs) - signatures of putative replay events - using electrical stimulation of the ventral hippocampal commissure in rats that were trained on three different spatial memory tasks. In each task, rats were required to memorize a new set of locations in each trial or each daily session. Interestingly, the rats performed equally well without SWR disruptions, but their performance declined with SWR disruptions. These data suggest that awake SWRs - and potentially replay - strongly affects the immediate behavior and the temporary memorization of relevant events at a short timescale that are required to successfully perform the spatial tasks. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the impact of awake replay on memory and behavior is long-term and cumulative over time.","Storing and accessing memories is required to successfully perform day-to-day tasks, for example for engaging in a meaningful conversation.

These data suggest that awake SWRs - and potentially replay - does not affect the immediate behavior nor the temporary memorization of relevant events at a short timescale that are required to successfully perform the spatial tasks. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the impact of awake replay on memory and behavior is long-term and cumulative over time.",text 2
"Increased levels of lactate, an end-product of glycolysis, have been proposed as a potential surrogate marker for metabolic changes during neuronal excitation. These changes in lactate levels can result in decreased brain pH, which has been implicated in patients with various neuropsychiatric disorders. We previously demonstrated that such alterations are commonly observed in five mouse models of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism, suggesting a shared endophenotype among these disorders rather than mere artifacts due to medications or agonal state. However, there is still limited research on this phenomenon in animal models, leaving its generality across other disease animal models uncertain. Moreover, the association between changes in brain lactate levels and specific behavioral abnormalities remains unclear. To address these gaps, the International Brain pH Project Consortium investigated brain pH and lactate levels in 109 strains/conditions of 2294 animals with genetic and other experimental manipulations relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders. Systematic analysis revealed that decreased brain pH and increased lactate levels were common features observed in multiple models of depression, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and some additional schizophrenia models. While certain autism models also exhibited decreased pH and increased lactate levels, others showed the opposite pattern, potentially reflecting subpopulations within the autism spectrum. Furthermore, utilizing large-scale behavioral test battery, a multivariate cross-validated prediction analysis demonstrated that poor working memory performance was predominantly associated with increased brain lactate levels. Importantly, this association was confirmed in an independent cohort of animal models. Collectively, these findings suggest that altered brain pH and lactate levels, which could be attributed to dysregulated excitation/inhibition balance, may serve as transdiagnostic endophenotypes of debilitating neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by cognitive impairment, irrespective of their beneficial or detrimental nature.","Increased levels of lactate, an end-product of glycolysis, have been proposed as a potential surrogate marker for metabolic changes during neuronal excitation.

"High levels of proinflammatory cytokines induce neurotoxicity and catalyze inflammation-driven neurodegeneration, but the specific release mechanisms from microglia remain elusive. Here we show that secretory autophagy (SA), a non-lytic modality of autophagy for secretion of vesicular cargo, regulates neuroinflammation-mediated neurodegeneration via SKA2 and FKBP5 signaling. SKA2 inhibits SA-dependent IL-1β release by counteracting FKBP5 function. Hippocampal Ska2 knockdown in male mice hyperactivates SA resulting in neuroinflammation, subsequent neurodegeneration and complete hippocampal atrophy within six weeks. The hyperactivation of SA increases IL-1β release, contributing to an inflammatory feed-forward vicious cycle including NLRP3-inflammasome activation and Gasdermin D-mediated neurotoxicity, which ultimately drives neurodegeneration. Results from protein expression and co-immunoprecipitation analyses of male and female postmortem human brains demonstrate that SA is hyperactivated in Alzheimer's disease. Overall, our findings suggest that SKA2-regulated, hyperactive SA facilitates neuroinflammation and is linked to Alzheimer's disease, providing mechanistic insight into the biology of neuroinflammation.","High levels of proinflammatory cytokines induce neurotoxicity and catalyze inflammation-driven neurodegeneration, but the specific release mechanisms from microglia remain elusive.

"The striatum serves an important role in motor control, and neurons in this area encode the body's initiation, cessation, and speed of locomotion. However, it remains unclear whether the same neurons also encode the step-by-step rhythmic motor patterns of individual limbs that characterize gait. By combining high-speed video tracking, electrophysiology, and optogenetic tagging, we found that a sizable population of both D1 and D2 receptor expressing medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs) were phase-locked to the gait cycle of individual limbs in mice. Healthy animals showed balanced limb phase-locking between D1 and D2 MSNs, while dopamine depletion led to weaker phase-locking in D2 MSNs. These findings indicate that striatal neurons represent gait on a single-limb and step basis, and suggest that elevated limb phase-locking of D2 MSNs may underlie some of the gait impairments associated with dopamine loss.","The striatum serves an important role in motor control, and neurons in this area encode the body's initiation, cessation, and speed of locomotion.

"Blood phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers, including p-tau217, show high associations with Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathologic change and clinical stage. Certain plasma p-tau217 assays recognize tau forms phosphorylated additionally at threonine-212, but the contribution of p-tau212 alone to AD is unknown. We developed a blood-based immunoassay that is specific to p-tau212 without cross-reactivity to p-tau217. Here, we examined the diagnostic utility of plasma p-tau212. In five cohorts (n = 388 participants), plasma p-tau212 showed high performances for AD diagnosis and for the detection of both amyloid and tau pathology, including at autopsy as well as in memory clinic populations. The diagnostic accuracy and fold changes of plasma p-tau212 were similar to those for p-tau217 but lower than p-tau181 and p-tau231. Immunofluorescent staining of brain tissue slices showed prominent p-tau212 reactivity in neurofibrillary tangles that co-localized with p-tau217 and p-tau202/205. These findings support plasma p-tau212 as a peripherally accessible biomarker of AD pathophysiology.","Blood phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers, including p-tau217, show high associations with Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathologic change and clinical stage.

"In the ALDH2 rs671 variant, a guanine changes to an adenine, resulting in a dramatic decrease in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Population-based data are contradictory about whether this variant increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease. In East Asian populations, the prevalence of the ALDH2 rs671 variant is 30-50%, making the National Human Brain Bank for Development and Function (the largest brain bank in East Asia) an important resource to explore the link between the ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease pathology. Here, using 469 postmortem brains, we find that while the ALDH2 rs671 variant is associated with increased plaque deposits and a higher Aβ40/42 ratio, it is not an independent risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Mechanistically, we show that lower ALDH2 activity leads to 4-HNE accumulation in the brain. The (R)-4-HNE enantiomer adducts to residue Lys53 of C99, favoring Aβ40 generation in the Golgi apparatus. Decreased ALDH2 activity also lowers inflammatory factor secretion, as well as amyloid β phagocytosis and spread in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. We thus define the relationship between the ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism and amyloid β pathology, and find that ALDH2 rs671 is a key regulator of Aβ40 or Aβ42 generation.","In the ALDH2 rs671 variant, a guanine changes to an adenine, resulting in a dramatic decrease in the catalytic activity of the enzyme.

"Vigilance refers to being alertly watchful or paying sustained attention to avoid potential threats. Animals in vigilance states reduce locomotion and have an enhanced sensitivity to aversive stimuli so as to react quickly to dangers. Here we report that an unconventional 5-HT driven mechanism operating at neural circuit level which shapes the internal state underlying vigilance behavior in zebrafish and male mice. The neural signature of internal vigilance state was characterized by persistent low-frequency high-amplitude neuronal synchrony in zebrafish dorsal pallium and mice prefrontal cortex. The neuronal synchronization underlying vigilance was dependent on intense release of 5-HT induced by persistent activation of either DRN 5-HT neuron or local 5-HT axon terminals in related brain regions via activation of 5-HTR7. Thus, we identify a mechanism of vigilance behavior across species that illustrates the interplay between neuromodulators and neural circuits necessary to shape behavior states.","Vigilance refers to being alertly watchful or paying sustained attention to avoid potential threats.

"Genomic rearrangements are a hallmark of most childhood tumors, including medulloblastoma, one of the most common brain tumors in children, but their causes remain largely unknown. Here, we show that PiggyBac transposable element derived 5 (Pgbd5) promotes tumor development in multiple developmentally accurate mouse models of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) medulloblastoma. Most Pgbd5-deficient mice do not develop tumors, while maintaining normal cerebellar development. Ectopic activation of SHH signaling is sufficient to enforce cerebellar granule cell progenitor-like cell states, which exhibit Pgbd5-dependent expression of distinct DNA repair and neurodevelopmental factors. Mouse medulloblastomas expressing Pgbd5 have decreased numbers of somatic structural DNA rearrangements, some of which carry PGBD5-specific sequences at their breakpoints. Similar sequence breakpoints recurrently affect somatic DNA rearrangements of known tumor suppressors and oncogenes in medulloblastomas in 329 children. This identifies PGBD5 as a medulloblastoma mutator and provides a genetic mechanism for the generation of oncogenic DNA rearrangements in childhood cancer.","Genomic rearrangements are a hallmark of most childhood tumors, including medulloblastoma, one of the most common brain tumors in children, but their causes remain largely unknown.

"Accumulating evidence points to dysregulations of the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) in eating disorders (ED), however its precise contribution to ED symptomatic dimensions remains unclear. Using chemogenetic manipulations in male mice, we found that activity of dopamine D1 receptor-expressing neurons of the NAc core subregion facilitated effort for a food reward as well as voluntary exercise, but decreased food intake, while D2-expressing neurons have opposite effects. These effects are congruent with D2-neurons being more active than D1-neurons during feeding while it is the opposite during running. Chronic manipulations of each subpopulations had limited effects on energy balance. However, repeated activation of D1-neurons combined with inhibition of D2-neurons biased behavior toward activity-related energy expenditure, whilst the opposite manipulations favored energy intake. Strikingly, concomitant activation of D1-neurons and inhibition of D2-neurons precipitated weight loss in anorexia models. These results suggest that dysregulations of NAc dopaminoceptive neurons might be at the core of EDs.","Accumulating evidence points to dysregulations of the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) in eating disorders (ED), however its precise contribution to ED symptomatic dimensions remains unclear.

"Consensus is rapidly building to support a role for the cerebellum beyond motor function, but its contributions to non-motor learning remain poorly understood. Here, we provide behavioral, anatomical and computational evidence to demonstrate a causal role for the primate posterior lateral cerebellum in learning new visuomotor associations. Reversible inactivation of the posterior lateral cerebellum of male monkeys impeded the learning of new visuomotor associations, but had no effect on movement parameters, or on well-practiced performance of the same task. Using retrograde transneuronal transport of rabies virus, we identified a distinct cerebro-cerebellar network linking Purkinje cells in the posterior lateral cerebellum with a region of the prefrontal cortex that is critical in learning visuomotor associations.

"Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex (EC) encode an individual's location in space, integrating both environmental and multisensory bodily cues. Notably, body-derived signals are also primary signals for the sense of self. While studies have demonstrated that continuous application of visuo-tactile bodily stimuli can induce perceptual shifts in self-location, it remains unexplored whether these illusory changes suffice to trigger grid cell-like representation (GCLR) within the EC, and how this compares to GCLR during conventional virtual navigation. To address this, we systematically induced illusory drifts in self-location toward controlled directions using visuo-tactile bodily stimulation, while maintaining the subjects' visual viewpoint fixed (absent conventional virtual navigation). Subsequently, we evaluated the corresponding GCLR in the EC through functional MRI analysis. Our results reveal that illusory changes in perceived self-location (independent of changes in environmental navigation cues) can indeed evoke entorhinal GCLR, correlating in strength with the magnitude of perceived self-location, and characterized by similar grid orientation as during conventional virtual navigation in the same virtual room. These data demonstrate that the same grid-like representation is recruited when navigating based on environmental, mainly visual cues, or when experiencing illusory forward drifts in self-location, driven by perceptual multisensory bodily cues.","Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex (EC) encode an individual's location in space, integrating both environmental and multisensory bodily cues.

"Thyroid hormone (TH) imbalance is linked to the pathophysiology of reversible dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is unclear whether tissue hypothyroidism occurs in the AD brain and how it affects on AD pathology. We find that decreased iodothyronine deiodinase 2 is correlated with hippocampal hypothyroidism in early AD model mice before TH alterations in the blood. TH deficiency leads to spontaneous activation of microglia in wild-type mice under nonstimulated conditions, resulting in lowered innate immune responses of microglia in response to inflammatory stimuli or amyloid-β. In AD model mice, TH deficiency alleviates AD pathology by reducing the disease-associated microglia population and microglial phagocytosis. We find that TH deficiency reduces microglial ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) and inhibition of CD73 leads to impaired innate immune responses in microglia. Our findings reveal that TH shapes microglial responses to inflammatory stimuli including amyloid-β, and brain hypothyroidism in early AD model mice aggravates AD pathology by microglial dysfunction.","Thyroid hormone (TH) imbalance is linked to the pathophysiology of reversible dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

"During learning, synaptic connections between excitatory neurons in the brain display considerable dynamism, with new connections being added and old connections eliminated. Synapse elimination offers an opportunity to understand the features of synapses that the brain deems dispensable. However, with limited observations of synaptic activity and plasticity in vivo, the features of synapses subjected to elimination remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the functional basis of synapse elimination in the apical dendrites of L2/3 neurons in the primary motor cortex throughout motor learning. We found no evidence that synapse elimination is facilitated by a lack of activity or other local forms of plasticity. Instead, eliminated synapses display synchronous activity with nearby synapses, suggesting that functional synaptic clustering is not a critical component of synapse survival. In addition, eliminated synapses show delayed activity timing with respect to postsynaptic output. Thus, synaptic inputs that fail to be co-active with their neighboring synapses or are mistimed with neuronal output are targeted for elimination.","During learning, synaptic connections between excitatory neurons in the brain display considerable dynamism, with new connections being added and old connections eliminated.

"Microglia are versatile regulators in brain development and disorders. Emerging evidence links microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation to microglial function; however, the exact underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we uncover the enrichment of miR-137, a neuropsychiatric-disorder-associated miRNA, in the microglial nucleus, and reveal its unexpected nuclear functions in maintaining the microglial global transcriptomic state, phagocytosis, and inflammatory response. Mechanistically, microglial Mir137 deletion increases chromatin accessibility, which contains binding motifs for the microglial master transcription factor Pu.1. Through biochemical and bioinformatics analyses, we propose that miR-137 modulates Pu.1-mediated gene expression by suppressing Pu.1 binding to chromatin. Importantly, we find that increased Pu.1 binding downregulates the target gene Jdp2 (Jun dimerization protein 2) and that knockdown of Jdp2 significantly suppresses the impaired phagocytosis and pro-inflammatory response in Mir137 knockout microglia. Collectively, our study provides evidence supporting the notion that nuclear miR-137 acts as a transcriptional modulator and that this microglia-specific function is essential for maintaining normal adult brain function.","Microglia are versatile regulators in brain development and disorders.

"Memorizing locations that are harmful or dangerous is a key capability of all organisms and requires an integration of affective and spatial information. In mammals, the dorsal hippocampus mainly processes spatial information, while the intermediate to ventral hippocampal divisions receive affective information via the amygdala. However, how spatial and aversive information is integrated is currently unknown. To address this question, we recorded the activity of hippocampal long-range CA3 axons at single-axon resolution in mice forming an aversive spatial memory. We show that intermediate CA3 to dorsal CA3 (i-dCA3) projections rapidly overrepresent areas preceding the location of an aversive stimulus due to a spatially selective addition of new place-coding axons followed by spatially non-specific stabilization. This sequence significantly improves the encoding of location by the i-dCA3 axon population. These results suggest that i-dCA3 axons transmit a precise, denoised, and stable signal indicating imminent danger to the dorsal hippocampus.","Memorizing locations that are harmful or dangerous is a key capability of all organisms and requires an integration of affective and spatial information.

"How neural representations preserve information about multiple stimuli is mysterious. Because tuning of individual neurons is coarse (e.g., visual receptive field diameters can exceed perceptual resolution), the populations of neurons potentially responsive to each individual stimulus can overlap, raising the question of how information about each item might be segregated and preserved in the population. We recently reported evidence for a potential solution to this problem: when two stimuli were present, some neurons in the macaque visual cortical areas V1 and V4 exhibited fluctuating firing patterns, as if they responded to only one individual stimulus at a time (Jun et al., 2022). However, whether such an information encoding strategy is ubiquitous in the visual pathway and thus could constitute a general phenomenon remains unknown. Here, we provide new evidence that such fluctuating activity is also evoked by multiple stimuli in visual areas responsible for processing visual motion (middle temporal visual area, MT), and faces (middle fundus and anterolateral face patches in inferotemporal cortex - areas MF and AL), thus extending the scope of circumstances in which fluctuating activity is observed. Furthermore, consistent with our previous results in the early visual area V1, MT exhibits fluctuations between the representations of two stimuli when these form distinguishable objects but not when they fuse into one perceived object, suggesting that fluctuating activity patterns may underlie visual object formation. Taken together, these findings point toward an updated model of how the brain preserves sensory information about multiple stimuli for subsequent processing and behavioral action.","How neural representations preserve information about multiple stimuli is mysterious.

"Blood-based biomarkers for screening may guide tau positrion emissition tomography (PET) scan referrals to optimize prognostic evaluation in Alzheimer's disease. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, pTau181, pTau217, pTau231, NfL, and GFAP were measured along with tau-PET in memory clinic patients with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment or dementia, in the Swedish BioFINDER-2 study (n = 548) and in the TRIAD study (n = 179). For each plasma biomarker, cutoffs were determined for 90%, 95%, or 97.5% sensitivity to detect tau-PET-positivity. We calculated the percentage of patients below the cutoffs (who would not undergo tau-PET; 'saved scans') and the tau-PET-positivity rate among participants above the cutoffs (who would undergo tau-PET; 'positive predictive value'). Generally, plasma pTau217 performed best. At the 95% sensitivity cutoff in both cohorts, pTau217 resulted in requiring nearly double the tau-PET scans, with a tau-PET-positivity rate among those who would be referred for a scan around 70%. And although tau-PET was strongly associated with subsequent cognitive decline, in BioFINDER-2 it predicted cognitive decline only among individuals above the referral cutoff on plasma pTau217, supporting that this workflow could reduce prognostically uninformative tau-PET scans. In conclusion, plasma pTau217 may guide selection of patients for tau-PET, when accurate prognostic information is of clinical value.","Blood-based biomarkers for screening may guide tau positrion emissition tomography (PET) scan referrals to optimize prognostic evaluation in Alzheimer's disease.

"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has diverse applications in physics, biology, and medicine. Uniform excitation of nuclei spins through circular-polarized transverse magnetic component of electromagnetic field is vital for obtaining unbiased tissue contrasts. However, achieving this in the electrically large human body poses a significant challenge, especially at ultra-high fields (UHF) with increased working frequencies (≥297 MHz). Canonical volume resonators struggle to meet this challenge, while radiative excitation methods like travelling-wave (TW) show promise but often suffer from inadequate excitation efficiency. Here, we introduce a new technique using a subwavelength dielectric waveguide insert that enhances both efficiency and homogeneity at 7 T. Through TE11-to-TM11 mode conversion, power focusing, wave impedance matching, and phase velocity matching, we achieved a 114% improvement in TW efficiency and mitigated the center-brightening effect. This fundamental advancement in TW MRI through effective wave manipulation could promote the electromagnetic design of UHF MRI systems.","Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has diverse applications in physics, biology, and medicine.

"The cortico-basal ganglia circuit mediates decision making. Here, we generated transgenic tools for adult zebrafish targeting specific subpopulations of the components of this circuit and utilized them to identify evolutionary homologs of the mammalian direct- and indirect-pathway striatal neurons, which respectively project to the homologs of the internal and external segment of the globus pallidus (dorsal entopeduncular nucleus [dEN] and lateral nucleus of the ventral telencephalic area [Vl]) as in mammals. Unlike in mammals, the Vl mainly projects to the dEN directly, not by way of the subthalamic nucleus. Further single-cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals two pallidal output pathways: a major shortcut pathway directly connecting the dEN with the pallium and the evolutionarily conserved closed loop by way of the thalamus. Our resources and circuit map provide the common basis for the functional study of the basal ganglia in a small and optically tractable zebrafish brain for the comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the cortico-basal ganglia circuit.","The cortico-basal ganglia circuit mediates decision making.

"Across the animal kingdom, visual predation relies on motion-sensing neurons in the superior colliculus (SC) and its orthologs. These neurons exhibit complex stimulus preferences, including direction selectivity, which is thought to be critical for tracking the unpredictable escape routes of prey. The source of direction selectivity in the SC is contested, and its contributions to predation have not been tested experimentally. Here, we use type-specific cell removal to show that narrow-field (NF) neurons in the mouse SC guide predation. In vivo recordings demonstrate that direction-selective responses of NF cells are independent of recently reported stimulus-edge effects. Monosynaptic retrograde tracing reveals that NF cells receive synaptic input from direction-selective ganglion cells. When we eliminate direction selectivity in the retina of adult mice, direction-selective responses in the SC, including in NF cells, are lost. However, eliminating retinal direction selectivity increases the hunting success of mice, even when direction selectivity is removed after mice have learned to hunt, and despite abolishing the gaze-stabilizing optokinetic reflex. Thus, our results identify the retinal source of direction selectivity in the SC. They show that NF cells in the SC guide predation, an essential spatial orienting task, independent of their direction selectivity, revealing behavioral multiplexing of complex neural feature preferences and highlighting the importance of feature-selective manipulations for neuroethology.","Across the animal kingdom, visual predation relies on motion-sensing neurons in the superior colliculus (SC) and its orthologs.

"Myelination of neuronal axons is essential for nervous system development. Myelination requires dramatic cytoskeletal dynamics in oligodendrocytes, but how actin is regulated during myelination is poorly understood. We recently identified serum response factor (SRF)-a transcription factor known to regulate expression of actin and actin regulators in other cell types-as a critical driver of myelination in the aged brain. Yet, a major gap remains in understanding the mechanistic role of SRF in oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Here, we show that SRF is required cell autonomously in oligodendrocytes for myelination during development. Combining ChIP-seq with RNA-seq identifies SRF-target genes in oligodendrocyte precursor cells and oligodendrocytes that include actin and other key cytoskeletal genes. Accordingly, SRF knockout oligodendrocytes exhibit dramatically increased actin filament levels early in differentiation, consistent with its role in actin-dependent myelin sheath initiation. Surprisingly, oligodendrocyte-restricted loss of SRF results in upregulation of gene signatures associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Together, our findings identify SRF as a transcriptional regulator that controls the expression of cytoskeletal genes required in oligodendrocytes for myelination. This study identifies an essential pathway regulating oligodendrocyte biology with high relevance to brain development, aging, and disease.","Myelination of neuronal axons is essential for nervous system development.

"The maturation of engrams from recent to remote time points involves the recruitment of CA1 neurons projecting to the anterior cingulate cortex (CA1→ACC). Modifications of G-protein-coupled receptor pathways in CA1 astrocytes affect recent and remote recall in seemingly contradictory ways. To address this inconsistency, we manipulated these pathways in astrocytes during memory acquisition and tagged c-Fos-positive engram cells and CA1→ACC cells during recent and remote recall. The behavioral results were coupled with changes in the recruitment of CA1→ACC projection cells to the engram: Gq pathway activation in astrocytes caused enhancement of recent recall alone and was accompanied by earlier recruitment of CA1→ACC projecting cells to the engram. In contrast, Gi pathway activation in astrocytes resulted in the impairment of only remote recall, and CA1→ACC projecting cells were not recruited during remote memory. Finally, we provide a simple working model, hypothesizing that Gq and Gi pathway activation affect memory differently, by modulating the same mechanism: CA1→ACC projection.","The maturation of engrams from recent to remote time points involves the recruitment of CA1 neurons projecting to the anterior cingulate cortex (CA1→ACC).

"When exposed to sensory sequences, do macaque monkeys spontaneously form abstract internal models that generalize to novel experiences? Here, we show that neuronal populations in macaque ventrolateral prefrontal cortex jointly encode visual sequences by separate codes for the specific pictures presented and for their abstract sequential structure. We recorded prefrontal neurons while macaque monkeys passively viewed visual sequences and sequence mismatches in the local-global paradigm. Even without any overt task or response requirements, prefrontal populations spontaneously form representations of sequence structure, serial order, and image identity within distinct but superimposed neuronal subspaces. Representations of sequence structure rapidly degrade following single exposure to a mismatch sequence, while distinct populations represent mismatches for sequences of different complexity. Finally, those representations generalize across sequences following the same repetition structure but comprising different images. These results suggest that prefrontal populations spontaneously encode rich internal models of visual sequences reflecting both content-specific and abstract information.","When exposed to sensory sequences, do macaque monkeys spontaneously form abstract internal models that generalize to novel experiences?

"The disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) is an important mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases. In the case of C9orf72-ALS, trafficking of macromolecules through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) might get frustrated by the binding of C9orf72-translated arginine-containing dipeptide repeat proteins (R-DPRs) to the Kapβ family of nuclear transport receptors. Besides Kapβs, several other types of transport components have been linked to NCT impairments in R-DPR-expressed cells, but the molecular origin of these observations has not been clarified. Here, we adopt a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model at amino acid resolution to study the direct interaction between polyPR, the most toxic DPR, and various nuclear transport components to elucidate the binding mechanisms and provide a complete picture of potential polyPR-mediated NCT defects. We found polyPR to directly bind to several isoforms of the Impα family, CAS (the specific exporter of Impα) and RanGAP. We observe no binding between polyPR and Ran. Longer polyPRs at lower salt concentrations also make contact with RanGEF and NTF2. Analyzing the polyPR contact sites on the transport components reveals that polyPR potentially interferes with RanGTP/RanGDP binding, with nuclear localization signal (NLS)-containing cargoes (cargo-NLS) binding to Impα, with cargo-NLS release from Impα, and with Impα export from the nucleus. The abundance of polyPR-binding sites on multiple transport components combined with the inherent polyPR length dependence makes direct polyPR interference of NCT a potential mechanistic pathway of C9orf72 toxicity.","The disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) is an important mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases.

"Synaptic dysfunction plays a key role in Parkinson's disease (PD), and plasma extracellular vesicle (EV) synaptic proteins are emerging as biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. Assessment of plasma EV synaptic proteins for their efficacy as biomarkers in PD and their relationship with disease progression was conducted. In total, 144 participants were enrolled, including 101 people with PD (PwP) and 43 healthy controls (HCs). The changes in plasma EV synaptic protein levels between baseline and 1-year follow-up differed significantly in both PwP and HCs. In PwP, the changes in plasma EV synaptic protein levels were significantly associated with the changes in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)-II and III scores. Moreover, PwP with elevated levels (first quartile) of any one plasma EV synaptic proteins (synaptosome-associated protein 25, growth-associated protein 43 or synaptotagmin-1) had significantly greater disease progression in UPDRS-II score and the postural instability and gait disturbance subscore in UPDRS-III than did the other PwP after adjustment for age, sex, and disease duration. The promising potential of plasma EV synaptic proteins as clinical biomarkers of disease progression in PD was suggested.

"Deciphering the complex relationship between neuroanatomical connections and functional activity in primate brains remains a daunting task, especially regarding the influence of monosynaptic connectivity on cortical activity. Here, we investigate the anatomical-functional relationship and decompose the neuronal-tracing connectome of marmoset brains into a series of eigenmodes using graph signal processing. These cellular connectome eigenmodes effectively catalyze the cortical activity derived from resting-state functional MRI, and uncover a patterned cellular-functional decoupling. This pattern reveals a spatial gradient from coupled dorsal-posterior to decoupled ventral-anterior cortices, and recapitulates micro-structural profiles and macro-scale hierarchical cortical organization. Notably, these marmoset-derived eigenmodes may facilitate the inference of spontaneous cortical activity and functional connectivity of homologous areas in humans, highlighting the potential generalizing of the connectomic constraints across species. Collectively, our findings illuminate how neuronal-tracing connectome eigenmodes constrain cortical activity and improve our understanding of the brain's anatomical-functional relationship.","Deciphering the complex relationship between neuroanatomical connections and functional activity in primate brains remains a daunting task, especially regarding the influence of monosynaptic connectivity on cortical activity.

"Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is characterized by calcium deposition in the brain, causing progressive movement disorders, psychiatric symptoms, and cognitive decline. PFBC is a heterogeneous disorder currently linked to variants in six different genes, but most patients remain genetically undiagnosed. Here, we identify biallelic NAA60 variants in ten individuals from seven families with autosomal recessive PFBC. The NAA60 variants lead to loss-of-function with lack of protein N-terminal (Nt)-acetylation activity. We show that the phosphate importer SLC20A2 is a substrate of NAA60 in vitro. In cells, loss of NAA60 caused reduced surface levels of SLC20A2 and a reduction in extracellular phosphate uptake. This study establishes NAA60 as a causal gene for PFBC, provides a possible biochemical explanation of its disease-causing mechanisms and underscores NAA60-mediated Nt-acetylation of transmembrane proteins as a detrimental process for healthy neurobiological functioning.","Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is characterized by calcium deposition in the brain, causing progressive movement disorders, psychiatric symptoms, and cognitive decline.

"Previous research has found that prolonged eye-based attention can bias ocular dominance. If one eye long-termly views a regular movie meanwhile the opposite eye views a backward movie of the same episode, perceptual ocular dominance will shift towards the eye previously viewing the backward movie. Yet it remains unclear whether the role of eye-based attention in this phenomenon is causal or not. To address this issue, the present study relied on both the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques. We found robust activation of the frontal eye field (FEF) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) when participants were watching the dichoptic movie while focusing their attention on the regular movie. Interestingly, we found a robust effect of attention-induced ocular dominance shift when the cortical function of vertex or IPS was transiently inhibited by continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), yet the effect was significantly attenuated to a negligible extent when cTBS was delivered to FEF. A control experiment verified that the attenuation of ocular dominance shift after inhibitory stimulation of FEF was not due to any impact of the cTBS on the binocular rivalry measurement of ocular dominance. These findings suggest that the fronto-parietal attentional network is involved in controlling eye-based attention in the 'dichoptic-backward-movie' adaptation paradigm, and in this network, FEF plays a crucial causal role in preventing the attention-induced ocular dominance shift.","Previous research has found that prolonged eye-based attention can bias ocular dominance.

"Oscillations arise in many real-world systems and are associated with both functional and dysfunctional states. Whether a network can oscillate can be estimated if we know the strength of interaction between nodes. But in real-world networks (in particular in biological networks) it is usually not possible to know the exact connection weights. Therefore, it is important to determine the structural properties of a network necessary to generate oscillations. Here, we provide a proof that uses dynamical system theory to prove that an odd number of inhibitory nodes and strong enough connections are necessary to generate oscillations in a single cycle threshold-linear network. We illustrate these analytical results in a biologically plausible network with either firing-rate based or spiking neurons. Our work provides structural properties necessary to prevent oscillations in a network. We use this knowledge to reconcile recent experimental findings about oscillations in basal ganglia with classical findings.","Oscillations arise in many real-world systems and are associated with both functional and dysfunctional states.

"Cognitive control resolves conflicts between task-relevant and -irrelevant information to enable goal-directed behavior. As conflicts can arise from different sources (e.g., sensory input, internal representations), how a limited set of cognitive control processes can effectively address diverse conflicts remains a major challenge. Based on the cognitive space theory, different conflicts can be parameterized and represented as distinct points in a (low-dimensional) cognitive space, which can then be resolved by a limited set of cognitive control processes working along the dimensions. It leads to a hypothesis that conflicts similar in their sources are also represented similarly in the cognitive space. We designed a task with five types of conflicts that could be conceptually parameterized. Both human performance and fMRI activity patterns in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex support that different types of conflicts are organized based on their similarity, thus suggesting cognitive space as a principle for representing conflicts.","Cognitive control resolves conflicts between task-relevant and -irrelevant information to enable goal-directed behavior.

"The specific roles that different types of neurons play in recovery from injury is poorly understood. Here, we show that increasing the excitability of ipsilaterally projecting, excitatory V2a neurons using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) restores rhythmic bursting activity to a previously paralyzed diaphragm within hours, days, or weeks following a C2 hemisection injury. Further, decreasing the excitability of V2a neurons impairs tonic diaphragm activity after injury as well as activation of inspiratory activity by chemosensory stimulation, but does not impact breathing at rest in healthy animals. By examining the patterns of muscle activity produced by modulating the excitability of V2a neurons, we provide evidence that V2a neurons supply tonic drive to phrenic circuits rather than increase rhythmic inspiratory drive at the level of the brainstem. Our results demonstrate that the V2a class of neurons do not contribute to recovery of respiratory function following injury. We propose that altering V2a excitability is a potential strategy to prevent respiratory motor failure and promote recovery of breathing following spinal cord injury.","The specific roles that different types of neurons play in recovery from injury is poorly understood.

"Adaptive myelination is the emerging concept of tuning axonal conduction velocity to the activity within specific neural circuits over time. Sound processing circuits exhibit structural and functional specifications to process signals with microsecond precision: a time scale that is amenable to adjustment in length and thickness of myelin. Increasing activity of auditory axons by introducing sound-evoked responses during postnatal development enhances myelin thickness, while sensory deprivation prevents such radial growth during development. When deprivation occurs during adulthood, myelin thickness was reduced. However, it is unclear whether sensory stimulation adjusts myelination in a global fashion (whole fiber bundles) or whether such adaptation occurs at the level of individual fibers. Using temporary monaural deprivation in mice provided an internal control for a) differentially tracing structural changes in active and deprived fibers and b) for monitoring neural activity in response to acoustic stimulation of the control and the deprived ear within the same animal. The data show that sound-evoked activity decreased the number of myelin layers around individual active axons, even when located in mixed bundles of active and deprived fibers. Thicker myelination correlated with faster axonal conduction velocity and caused shorter auditory brainstem response wave VI-I delays, providing a physiologically relevant readout. The lack of global compensation emphasizes the importance of balanced sensory experience in both ears throughout the lifespan of an individual.","Adaptive myelination is the emerging concept of tuning axonal conduction velocity to the activity within specific neural circuits over time.

The data show that sound-evoked activity increased the number of myelin layers around individual active axons, even when located in mixed bundles of active and deprived fibers. Thicker myelination correlated with faster axonal conduction velocity and caused shorter auditory brainstem response wave VI-I delays, providing a physiologically relevant readout. The lack of global compensation emphasizes the importance of balanced sensory experience in both ears throughout the lifespan of an individual.",text 2
"In order to survive, animals often need to navigate a complex odor landscape where odors can exist in airborne plumes. Several odor plume properties change with distance from the odor source, providing potential navigational cues to searching animals. Here, we focus on odor intermittency, a temporal odor plume property that measures the fraction of time odor is above a threshold at a given point within the plume and decreases with increasing distance from the odor source. We sought to determine if mice can use changes in intermittency to locate an odor source. To do so, we trained mice on an intermittency discrimination task. We establish that mice cannot discriminate odor plume samples of low and high intermittency and that the neural responses in the olfactory bulb can account for task performance and support intermittency encoding. Modulation of sniffing, a behavioral parameter that is highly dynamic during odor-guided navigation, affects both behavioral outcome on the intermittency discrimination task and neural representation of intermittency. Together, this work demonstrates that intermittency is an odor plume property that can inform olfactory search and more broadly supports the notion that mammalian odor-based navigation can be guided by temporal odor plume properties.","In order to survive, animals often need to navigate a complex odor landscape where odors can exist in airborne plumes.

"In children, psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are related to risk of psychosis, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders. Maladaptive cognitive functioning, influenced by genetic and environmental factors, is hypothesized to mediate the relationship between these factors and childhood PLEs. Using large-scale longitudinal data, we tested the relationships of genetic and environmental factors (such as familial and neighborhood environment) with cognitive intelligence and their relationships with current and future PLEs in children. We leveraged large-scale multimodal data of 6,602 children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study. Linear mixed model and a novel structural equation modeling (SEM) method that allows estimation of both components and factors were used to estimate the joint effects of cognitive phenotypes polygenic scores (PGSs), familial and neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), and supportive environment on NIH Toolbox cognitive intelligence and PLEs. We adjusted for ethnicity (genetically defined), schizophrenia PGS, and additionally unobserved confounders (using computational confound modeling). Our findings indicate that lower cognitive intelligence and higher PLEs are significantly associated with lower PGSs for cognitive phenotypes, lower familial SES, lower neighborhood SES, and less supportive environments. Specifically, cognitive intelligence mediates the effects of these factors on PLEs, with supportive parenting and positive school environments showing the strongest impact on reducing PLEs. This study underscores the influence of genetic and environmental factors on PLEs through their effects on cognitive intelligence. Our findings have policy implications in that improving school and family environments and promoting local economic development may enhance cognitive and mental health in children.","In children, psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are related to risk of psychosis, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders.

"Myelinated axons form long-range connections that enable rapid communication between distant brain regions, but how genetics governs the strength and organization of these connections remains unclear. We perform genome-wide association studies of 206 structural connectivity measures derived from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging tractography of 26,333 UK Biobank participants, each representing the density of myelinated connections within or between a pair of cortical networks, subcortical structures or cortical hemispheres. We identify 30 independent genome-wide significant variants after Bonferroni correction for the number of measures studied (126 variants at nominal genome-wide significance) implicating genes involved in myelination (SEMA3A), neurite elongation and guidance (NUAK1, STRN, DPYSL2, EPHA3, SEMA3A, HGF, SHTN1), neural cell proliferation and differentiation (GMNC, CELF4, HGF), neuronal migration (CCDC88C), cytoskeletal organization (CTTNBP2, MAPT, DAAM1, MYO16, PLEC), and brain metal transport (SLC39A8). These variants have four broad patterns of spatial association with structural connectivity: some have disproportionately strong associations with corticothalamic connectivity, interhemispheric connectivity, or both, while others are more spatially diffuse. Structural connectivity measures are highly polygenic, with a median of 9.1 percent of common variants estimated to have non-zero effects on each measure, and exhibited signatures of positive selection. Structural connectivity measures have significant genetic correlations with a variety of neuropsychiatric and cognitive traits, indicating that connectivity-altering variants tend to influence brain health and cognitive function. Heritability is enriched in regions with increased chromatin accessibility in adult oligodendrocytes (as well as microglia, inhibitory neurons and astrocytes) and multiple fetal cell types, suggesting that genetic control of structural connectivity is partially mediated by effects on myelination and early brain development. Our results indicate pervasive, pleiotropic, and spatially structured genetic control of white-matter structural connectivity via diverse neurodevelopmental pathways, and support the relevance of this genetic control to healthy brain function.","Myelinated axons form long-range connections that enable rapid communication between distant brain regions, but how genetics governs the strength and organization of these connections remains unclear.

"DNA methylation provides a crucial epigenetic mark linking genetic variations to environmental influence. We have analyzed array-based DNA methylation profiles of 160 human retinas with co-measured RNA-seq and >8 million genetic variants, uncovering sites of genetic regulation in cis (37,453 methylation quantitative trait loci and 12,505 expression quantitative trait loci) and 13,747 DNA methylation loci affecting gene expression, with over one-third specific to the retina. Methylation and expression quantitative trait loci show non-random distribution and enrichment of biological processes related to synapse, mitochondria, and catabolism. Summary data-based Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses identify 87 target genes where methylation and gene-expression changes likely mediate the genotype effect on age-related macular degeneration. Integrated pathway analysis reveals epigenetic regulation of immune response and metabolism including the glutathione pathway and glycolysis. Our study thus defines key roles of genetic variations restraining methylation changes, prioritizes epigenetic control of gene expression, and suggests frameworks for regulation of macular degeneration pathology by genotype-environment interaction in retina.","DNA methylation provides a crucial epigenetic mark linking genetic variations to environmental influence.

"The ""dorsal pons"", or ""dorsal pontine tegmentum"" (dPnTg), is part of the brainstem. It is a complex, densely packed region whose nuclei are involved in regulating many vital functions.

In this study, we applied single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) to resolve neuronal subtypes based on their unique transcriptional profiles and then used multiplexed error robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) to map them spatially. We sampled ~1 million cells across the dPnTg and defined the spatial distribution of over 120 neuronal subtypes. Our analysis identified an unpredicted high transcriptional diversity in this region and pinpointed the unique marker genes of many neuronal subtypes. We also demonstrated that many neuronal subtypes are transcriptionally similar between humans and mice, enhancing this study's translational value.

"The endothelial lining of cerebral microvessels is damaged relatively early after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and mediates blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, neurovascular injury, and long-term neurological deficits. I/R induces BBB leakage within 1 h due to subtle structural alterations in endothelial cells (ECs), including reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and subcellular redistribution of junctional proteins. Herein, we show that the protein peroxiredoxin-4 (Prx4) is an endogenous protectant against endothelial dysfunction and BBB damage in a murine I/R model. We observed a transient upregulation of Prx4 in brain ECs 6 h after I/R in wild-type (WT) mice, whereas tamoxifen-induced, selective knockout of Prx4 from endothelial cells (eKO) mice dramatically raised vulnerability to I/R. Specifically, eKO mice displayed more BBB damage than WT mice within 1 to 24 h after I/R and worse long-term neurological deficits and focal brain atrophy by 35 d. Conversely, endothelium-targeted transgenic (eTG) mice overexpressing Prx4 were resistant to I/R-induced early BBB damage and had better long-term functional outcomes. As demonstrated in cultures of human brain endothelial cells and in animal models of I/R, Prx4 suppresses actin polymerization and stress fiber formation in brain ECs, at least in part by inhibiting phosphorylation/activation of myosin light chain. The latter cascade prevents redistribution of junctional proteins and BBB leakage under conditions of Prx4 repletion. Prx4 also tempers microvascular inflammation and infiltration of destructive neutrophils and proinflammatory macrophages into the brain parenchyma after I/R. Thus, the evidence supports an indispensable role for endothelial Prx4 in safeguarding the BBB and promoting functional recovery after I/R brain injury.","The endothelial lining of cerebral microvessels is damaged relatively early after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and mediates blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, neurovascular injury, and long-term neurological deficits.

"Obesity is associated with neurocognitive dysfunction, including memory deficits. This is particularly worrisome when obesity occurs during adolescence, a maturational period for brain structures critical for cognition. In rodent models, we recently reported that memory impairments induced by obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD) intake during the periadolescent period can be reversed by chemogenetic manipulation of the ventral hippocampus (vHPC). Here, we used an intersectional viral approach in HFD-fed male mice to chemogenetically inactivate specific vHPC efferent pathways to nucleus accumbens (NAc) or medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during memory tasks. We first demonstrated that HFD enhanced activation of both pathways after training and that our chemogenetic approach was effective in normalizing this activation. Inactivation of the vHPC-NAc pathway rescued HFD-induced deficits in recognition but not location memory. Conversely, inactivation of the vHPC-mPFC pathway restored location but not recognition memory impairments produced by HFD. Either pathway manipulation did not affect exploration or anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that HFD intake throughout adolescence impairs different types of memory through overactivation of specific hippocampal efferent pathways and that targeting these overactive pathways has therapeutic potential.","Obesity is associated with neurocognitive dysfunction, including memory deficits.

"Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene are the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. Due to the lack of trunk neuromuscular organoids (NMOs) from ALS patients' induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), an organoid system was missing to model the trunk spinal neuromuscular neurodegeneration. With the C9orf72 ALS patient-derived iPSCs and isogenic controls, we used an NMO system containing trunk spinal cord neural and peripheral muscular tissues to show that the ALS NMOs could model peripheral defects in ALS, including contraction weakness, neural denervation, and loss of Schwann cells. The neurons and astrocytes in ALS NMOs manifested the RNA foci and dipeptide repeat proteins. Acute treatment with the unfolded protein response inhibitor GSK2606414 decreased the glutamatergic muscular contraction 2-fold and reduced the dipeptide repeat protein aggregation and autophagy.

"Phosphomannomutase 2-congenital disorder of glycosylation (PMM2-CDG) is a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by deficiency of the PMM2 enzyme, which leads to impaired protein glycosylation.

Utilizing multi-omics datasets from 3D human cortical organoids (hCOs) derived from PMM2-CDG individuals, we identify widespread decreases in protein glycosylation, highlighting impaired glycosylation as a key pathological feature of PMM2-CDG, as well as impaired mitochondrial structure and abnormal glucose metabolism in PMM2-deficient hCOs, indicating disturbances in energy metabolism. Correlation between PMM2 enzymatic activity in hCOs and symptom severity suggests that the level of PMM2 enzyme function directly influences neurological manifestations.

"How sensory systems extract salient features from natural environments and organize them across neural pathways is unclear. Combining single-cell and population two-photon calcium imaging in mice, we discover that retinal ON bipolar cells (second-order neurons of the visual system) are divided into two blocks of four types. The two blocks distribute temporal and spatial information encoding, respectively. ON bipolar cell axons co-stratify within each block, but separate laminarly between them (upper block: diverse temporal, uniform spatial tuning; lower block: diverse spatial, uniform temporal tuning). ON bipolar cells extract temporal and spatial features similarly from artificial and naturalistic stimuli. In addition, they differ in sensitivity to coherent motion in naturalistic movies. Motion information is distributed across ON bipolar cells in the upper and the lower blocks, multiplexed with temporal and spatial contrast, interconnected features of natural scenes. Comparing the responses of different boutons within the same arbor, we find that axons of all ON bipolar cell types do not function as computational units. Thus, our results provide insights into the visual feature extraction from naturalistic stimuli and reveal how structural and functional organization cooperate to generate parallel ON pathways for temporal and spatial information in the mammalian retina.","How sensory systems extract salient features from natural environments and organize them across neural pathways is unclear.

"The striatum, known as the input nucleus of the basal ganglia, is extensively studied for its diverse behavioral roles. However, the relationship between its neuronal and vascular activity, vital for interpreting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals, has not received comprehensive examination within the striatum. Here, we demonstrate that optogenetic stimulation of dorsal striatal neurons or their afferents from various cortical and subcortical regions induces negative striatal fMRI responses in rats, manifesting as vasoconstriction. These responses occur even with heightened striatal neuronal activity, confirmed by electrophysiology and fiber-photometry. In parallel, midbrain dopaminergic neuron optogenetic modulation, coupled with electrochemical measurements, establishes a link between striatal vasodilation and dopamine release. Intriguingly, in vivo intra-striatal pharmacological manipulations during optogenetic stimulation highlight a critical role of opioidergic signaling in generating striatal vasoconstriction. This observation is substantiated by detecting striatal vasoconstriction in brain slices after synthetic opioid application. In humans, manipulations aimed at increasing striatal neuronal activity likewise elicit positive striatal fMRI responses.

Combining single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and multiplexed fluorescent in situ hybridization, we identify three discrete excitatory cell-type clusters that correspond to the known nuclei of the ATN and uncover marker genes, molecular pathways, and putative functions of these cell types. We further illustrate graded spatial variation along the dorsomedial-ventrolateral axis for all individual nuclei of the ATN and additionally demonstrate that the anteroventral nucleus exhibits spatially covarying protein products and long-range inputs.

"Investigating how, when, and what subjects learn during decision-making tasks requires tracking their choice strategies on a trial-by-trial basis. Here, we present a simple but effective probabilistic approach to tracking choice strategies at trial resolution using Bayesian evidence accumulation. We show this approach identifies both successful learning and the exploratory strategies used in decision tasks performed by humans, non-human primates, rats, and synthetic agents. Both when subjects learn and when rules change the exploratory strategies of win-stay and lose-shift, often considered complementary, are consistently used independently. Indeed, we find the use of lose-shift is strong evidence that subjects have latently learnt the salient features of a new rewarded rule. Our approach can be extended to any discrete choice strategy, and its low computational cost is ideally suited for real-time analysis and closed-loop control.","Investigating how, when, and what subjects learn during decision-making tasks requires tracking their choice strategies on a trial-by-trial basis.

"The nature of spinal output pathways that convey nociceptive information to the brain has been the subject of controversy. Here, we provide anatomical, molecular, and functional characterizations of two distinct anterolateral pathways: one, ascending in the lateral spinal cord, triggers nociceptive behaviors, and the other one, ascending in the ventral spinal cord, when inhibited, leads to sensorimotor deficits. Moreover, the lateral pathway consists of at least two subtypes. The first is a contralateral pathway that extends to the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and thalamus; the second is a bilateral pathway that projects to the bilateral parabrachial nucleus (PBN). Finally, we present evidence showing that activation of the contralateral pathway decreases the likelihood of defensive behaviors such as running and freezing, whereas the bilateral pathway is sufficient for attending behaviors such as licking and guarding. This work offers insight into the complex organizational logic of the anterolateral system in the mouse.","The nature of spinal output pathways that convey nociceptive information to the brain has been the subject of controversy.

The first is a contralateral pathway that extends to the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and thalamus; the second is a bilateral pathway that projects to the bilateral parabrachial nucleus (PBN). Finally, we present evidence showing that activation of the contralateral pathway is sufficient for defensive behaviors such as running and freezing, whereas the bilateral pathway is sufficient for attending behaviors such as licking and guarding. This work offers insight into the complex organizational logic of the anterolateral system in the mouse.",text 2
"The neural mechanisms underlying novelty detection are not well understood, especially in relation to behavior. Here, we present single-unit responses from the primary auditory cortex (A1) from two monkeys trained to detect deviant tones amid repetitive ones. Results show that monkeys can detect deviant sounds, and there is a strong correlation between late neuronal responses (250-350 ms after deviant onset) and the monkeys' perceptual decisions. The magnitude and timing of both neuronal and behavioral responses are decreased by larger frequency differences between the deviant and standard tones and by increasing the number of standard tones preceding the deviant. This suggests that A1 neurons encode novelty detection in behaving monkeys, influenced by stimulus relevance and expectations. This study provides evidence supporting aspects of predictive coding in the sensory cortex.","The neural mechanisms underlying novelty detection are not well understood, especially in relation to behavior.

"Glia interact with multiple neurons, but it is unclear whether their interactions with each neuron are different. Our interrogation at single-cell resolution reveals that a single glial cell exhibits specificity in its interactions with different contacting neurons. Briefly, C. elegans amphid sheath (AMsh) glia apical-like domains contact 12 neuron-endings. At these ad-neuronal membranes, AMsh glia localize the K/Cl transporter KCC-3 to a microdomain exclusively around the thermosensory AFD neuron to regulate its properties. Glial KCC-3 is transported to ad-neuronal regions, where distal cilia of non-AFD glia-associated chemosensory neurons constrain it to a microdomain at AFD-contacting glial membranes. Aberrant KCC-3 localization improves both thermosensory (AFD) and chemosensory (non-AFD) neuron properties. Thus, neurons can interact non-synaptically through a shared glial cell by regulating microdomain localization of its cues. As AMsh and glia across species compartmentalize multiple cues like KCC-3, we posit that this may be a broadly conserved glial mechanism that modulates information processing across multimodal circuits.","Glia interact with multiple neurons, but it is unclear whether their interactions with each neuron are different.

"Motor neurons (MNs) constitute an ancient cell type targeted by multiple adult-onset diseases. It is therefore important to define the molecular makeup of adult MNs in animal models and extract organizing principles. Here, we generate a comprehensive molecular atlas of adult Caenorhabditis elegans MNs and a searchable database. Single-cell RNA sequencing of 13,200 cells reveals that ventral nerve cord MNs cluster into 29 molecularly distinct subclasses. Extending C. elegans Neuronal Gene Expression Map and Network (CeNGEN) findings, all MN subclasses are delineated by distinct expression codes of either neuropeptide or transcription factor gene families. Strikingly, combinatorial codes of homeodomain transcription factor genes succinctly delineate adult MN diversity in both C. elegans and mice. Further, molecularly defined MN subclasses in C. elegans display distinct patterns of connectivity. Hence, our study couples the connectivity map of the C. elegans motor circuit with a molecular atlas of its constituent MNs and uncovers organizing principles and conserved molecular codes of adult MN diversity.","Motor neurons (MNs) constitute an ancient cell type targeted by multiple adult-onset diseases.

"The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex exhibit rich oscillatory patterns critical for cognitive functions. In the hippocampal region CA1, specific gamma-frequency oscillations, timed at different phases of the ongoing theta rhythm, are hypothesized to facilitate the integration of information from varied sources and contribute to distinct cognitive processes. Here, we show that gamma elements -a multidimensional characterization of transient gamma oscillatory episodes- occur at any frequency or phase relative to the ongoing theta rhythm across all CA1 layers in male mice. Despite their low power and stochastic-like nature, individual gamma elements still carry behavior-related information and computational modeling suggests that they reflect neuronal firing. Our findings challenge the idea of rigid gamma sub-bands, showing that behavior shapes ensembles of irregular gamma elements that evolve with learning and depend on hippocampal layers. Widespread gamma diversity, beyond randomness, may thus reflect complexity, likely functional but invisible to classic average-based analyses.","The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex exhibit rich oscillatory patterns critical for cognitive functions.

"Predictive modeling is a central technique in neuroimaging to identify brain-behavior relationships and test their generalizability to unseen data. However, data leakage undermines the validity of predictive models by breaching the separation between training and test data. Leakage is always an incorrect practice but still pervasive in machine learning. Understanding its effects on neuroimaging predictive models can inform how leakage affects existing literature. Here, we investigate the effects of five forms of leakage-involving feature selection, covariate correction, and dependence between subjects-on functional and structural connectome-based machine learning models across four datasets and three phenotypes. Leakage via feature selection and repeated subjects drastically decreases prediction performance, whereas other forms of leakage have minor effects. Furthermore, small datasets exacerbate the effects of leakage. Overall, our results illustrate the variable effects of leakage and underscore the importance of avoiding data leakage to improve the validity and reproducibility of predictive modeling.","Predictive modeling is a central technique in neuroimaging to identify brain-behavior relationships and test their generalizability to unseen data.

"Dendritic mechanisms driving input-output transformation in starburst amacrine cells (SACs) are not fully understood. Here, we combine two-photon subcellular voltage and calcium imaging and electrophysiological recording to determine the computational architecture of mouse SAC dendrites. We found that the perisomatic region integrates motion signals over the entire dendritic field, providing a low-pass-filtered global depolarization to dendrites. Dendrites integrate local synaptic inputs with this global signal in a direction-selective manner. Coincidental local synaptic inputs and the global motion signal in the outward motion direction generate local suprathreshold calcium transients. Moreover, metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) signaling in SACs modulates the initiation of calcium transients in dendrites but not at the soma. In contrast, voltage-gated potassium channel 3 (Kv3) dampens fast voltage transients at the soma. Together, complementary mGluR2 and Kv3 signaling in different subcellular regions leads to dendritic compartmentalization and direction selectivity, highlighting the importance of these mechanisms in dendritic computation.","Dendritic mechanisms driving input-output transformation in starburst amacrine cells (SACs) are not fully understood.

"Cerebral perfusion is critical for the early detection of neurological diseases and for effectively monitoring disease progression and treatment responses. Mouse models are widely used in brain research, often under anesthesia, which can affect vascular physiology. However, the impact of anesthesia on regional cerebral blood volume and flow in mice has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we have developed a whole-brain perfusion MRI approach by using a 5-second nitrogen gas stimulus under inhalational anesthetics to induce transient BOLD dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC). This method proved to be highly sensitive, repeatable within each imaging session, and across four weekly sessions. Relative cerebral blood volumes measured by BOLD DSC agree well with those by contrast agents. Quantitative cerebral blood volume and flow metrics were successfully measured in mice under dexmedetomidine and various isoflurane doses using both total vasculature-sensitive gradient-echo and microvasculature-sensitive spin-echo BOLD MRI. Dexmedetomidine increases cerebral perfusion, while isoflurane increases cerebral perfusion in a dose-dependent manner.","Cerebral perfusion is critical for the early detection of neurological diseases and for effectively monitoring disease progression and treatment responses.

"Individuals with Williams syndrome (WS), a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by hemizygous loss of 26-28 genes at 7q11.23, characteristically portray a hypersocial phenotype.

GTF2I-KO progenitors exhibit increased proliferation and cell-cycle alterations. Cortical organoids and neurons demonstrate increased cell death and synaptic dysregulation, including synaptic structural dysfunction and decreased electrophysiological activity on a multielectrode array.

"Common genetic variation has been associated with multiple phenotypic features in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, our knowledge of shared genetic factor structures contributing to this highly heterogeneous phenotypic spectrum is limited. Here, we developed and implemented a structural equation modelling framework to directly model genomic covariance across core and non-core ASD phenotypes, studying autistic individuals of European descent with a case-only design. We identified three independent genetic factors most strongly linked to language performance, behaviour and developmental motor delay, respectively, studying an autism community sample (N = 5331). The three-factorial structure was largely confirmed in independent ASD-simplex families (N = 1946), although we uncovered, in addition, simplex-specific genetic overlap between behaviour and language phenotypes. Multivariate models across cohorts revealed novel associations, including links between language and early mastering of self-feeding. Thus, the common genetic architecture in ASD is multi-dimensional with overarching genetic factors contributing, in combination with ascertainment-specific patterns, to phenotypic heterogeneity.","Common genetic variation has been associated with multiple phenotypic features in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

"A fundamental question in neurodevelopmental biology is how flexibly the nervous system changes during development. To address this, we reconstructed the chemical connectome of dauer, an alternative developmental stage of nematodes with distinct behavioral characteristics, by volumetric reconstruction and automated synapse detection using deep learning. With the basic architecture of the nervous system preserved, structural changes in neurons, large or small, were closely associated with connectivity changes, which in turn suppressed dauer-specific behaviors such as nictation. Graph theoretical analyses revealed significant dauer-specific rewiring of sensory neuron connectivity and increased clustering within motor neurons in the dauer connectome. We suggest that the nervous system in the nematode has evolved to respond to harsh environments by developing a quantitatively and qualitatively differentiated connectome.","A fundamental question in neurodevelopmental biology is how flexibly the nervous system changes during development.

Nine hypomorphic SNUPN biallelic variants, predominantly clustered in the last coding exon, are ascertained to segregate with the disease. We demonstrate that mutant SPN1 failed to oligomerize leading to cytoplasmic aggregation in patients' primary fibroblasts and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutant cell lines. Additionally, mutant nuclei exhibit defective spliceosomal maturation and breakdown of Cajal bodies. Transcriptome analyses reveal splicing and mRNA expression dysregulation, particularly in sarcolemmal components, causing disruption of cytoskeletal organization in mutant cells and patient muscle tissues.

"Axon diameter influences the conduction properties of myelinated axons, both directly, and indirectly through effects on myelin. However, we have limited understanding of mechanisms controlling axon diameter growth in the central nervous system, preventing systematic dissection of how manipulating diameter affects myelination and conduction along individual axons. Here we establish zebrafish to study axon diameter. We find that importin 13b is required for axon diameter growth, but does not affect cell body size or axon length. Using neuron-specific ipo13b mutants, we assess how reduced axon diameter affects myelination and conduction, and find no changes to myelin thickness, precision of action potential propagation, or ability to sustain high frequency firing. However, increases in conduction speed that occur along single myelinated axons with development are tightly linked to their growth in diameter. This suggests that axon diameter growth is a major driver of increases in conduction speeds along myelinated axons over time.","Axon diameter influences the conduction properties of myelinated axons, both directly, and indirectly through effects on myelin.

"Primate hands house an array of mechanoreceptors and proprioceptors, which are essential for tactile and kinematic information crucial for daily motor action. While the regulation of these somatosensory signals is essential for hand movements, the specific central nervous system (CNS) location and mechanism remain unclear. Our study demonstrates the attenuation of somatosensory signals in the cuneate nucleus during voluntary movement, suggesting significant modulation at this initial relay station in the CNS. The attenuation is comparable to the cerebral cortex but more pronounced than in the spinal cord, indicating the cuneate nuclei's role in somatosensory perception modulation during movement. Moreover, our findings suggest that the descending motor tract may regulate somatosensory transmission in the cuneate nucleus, enhancing relevant signals and suppressing unnecessary ones for the regulation of movement. This process of recurrent somatosensory modulation between cortical and subcortical areas could be a basic mechanism for modulating somatosensory signals to achieve active perception.","Primate hands house an array of mechanoreceptors and proprioceptors, which are essential for tactile and kinematic information crucial for daily motor action.

"Emotion and perception are tightly intertwined, as affective experiences often arise from the appraisal of sensory information. Nonetheless, whether the brain encodes emotional instances using a sensory-specific code or in a more abstract manner is unclear. Here, we answer this question by measuring the association between emotion ratings collected during a unisensory or multisensory presentation of a full-length movie and brain activity recorded in typically developed, congenitally blind and congenitally deaf participants. Emotional instances are encoded in a vast network encompassing sensory, prefrontal, and temporal cortices. Within this network, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex stores a categorical representation of emotion dependent on modality and previous sensory experience, and the posterior superior temporal cortex maps the valence dimension using an abstract code. Sensory experience more than modality affects how the brain organizes emotional information outside supramodal regions, suggesting the existence of a scaffold for the representation of emotional states where sensory inputs during development shape its functioning.","Emotion and perception are tightly intertwined, as affective experiences often arise from the appraisal of sensory information.

"Visceral signals are constantly processed by our central nervous system, enable homeostatic regulation, and influence perception, emotion, and cognition. While visceral processes at the cortical level have been extensively studied using non-invasive imaging techniques, very few studies have investigated how this information is processed at the single neuron level, both in humans and animals. Subcortical regions, relaying signals from peripheral interoceptors to cortical structures, are particularly understudied and how visceral information is processed in thalamic and subthalamic structures remains largely unknown. Here, we took advantage of intraoperative microelectrode recordings in patients undergoing surgery for deep brain stimulation (DBS) to investigate the activity of single neurons related to cardiac and respiratory functions in three subcortical regions: ventral intermedius nucleus (Vim) and ventral caudalis nucleus (Vc) of the thalamus, and subthalamic nucleus (STN). We report that the activity of a large portion of the recorded neurons (about 70%) was modulated by either the heartbeat, the cardiac inter-beat interval, or the respiration. These cardiac and respiratory response patterns varied largely across neurons both in terms of timing and their kind of modulation. A substantial proportion of these visceral neurons (30%) was responsive to more than one of the tested signals, underlining specialization and integration of cardiac and respiratory signals in STN and thalamic neurons. By extensively describing single unit activity related to cardiorespiratory function in thalamic and subthalamic neurons, our results highlight the major role of these subcortical regions in the processing of visceral signals.","Visceral signals are constantly processed by our central nervous system, enable homeostatic regulation, and influence perception, emotion, and cognition.

Contrary to our expectations, a substantial proportion of these visceral neurons (30%) was non-responsive to more than one of the tested signals, challenging the specialization and integration of cardiac and respiratory signals in STN and thalamic neurons. By extensively describing single unit activity related to cardiorespiratory function in thalamic and subthalamic neurons, our results highlight the major role of these subcortical regions in the processing of visceral signals.",text 1
"Determining the sites and directions of plasticity underlying changes in neural activity and behavior is critical for understanding mechanisms of learning. Identifying such plasticity from neural recording data can be challenging due to feedback pathways that impede reasoning about cause and effect. We studied interactions between feedback, neural activity, and plasticity in the context of a closed-loop motor learning task for which there is disagreement about the loci and directions of plasticity: vestibulo-ocular reflex learning. We constructed a set of circuit models that differed in the strength of their recurrent feedback, from no feedback to very strong feedback. Despite these differences, each model successfully fit a large set of neural and behavioral data. However, the patterns of plasticity predicted by the models fundamentally differed, with the direction of plasticity at a key site changing from potentiation to depression as feedback strength increased. Guided by our analysis, we suggest how such models can be experimentally disambiguated. Our results address a long-standing debate regarding cerebellum-dependent motor learning, suggesting a reconciliation in which learning-related changes in the strength of synaptic inputs to Purkinje cells are compatible with seemingly oppositely directed changes in Purkinje cell spiking activity. More broadly, these results demonstrate how changes in neural activity over learning can appear to contradict the sign of the underlying plasticity when either internal feedback or feedback through the environment is present.","Determining the sites and directions of plasticity underlying changes in neural activity and behavior is critical for understanding mechanisms of learning.

"We examined the distribution of pre-synaptic contacts in axons of mouse neurons and constructed whole-brain single-cell neuronal networks using an extensive dataset of 1,891 fully reconstructed neurons. As our algorithm was able to generate whole-brain single-cell connectivity matrices from full morphology reconstruction datasets, we further found that non-homogeneous bouton locations have a significant impact on network wiring, including degree distribution, triad census, and community structure. By perturbing neuronal morphology, we further explored the link between anatomical details and network topology. We found that bouton locations were not homogeneous throughout the axon and among brain regions. In our in silico exploration, we found that synaptic contact deletion would have the greatest impact on network wiring, followed by dendritic and axonal tree span. Our results suggest that neuroanatomical details must be carefully addressed in studies of whole-brain networks at the single-cell level.","We examined the distribution of pre-synaptic contacts in axons of mouse neurons and constructed whole-brain single-cell neuronal networks using an extensive dataset of 1,891 fully reconstructed neurons.

"Stroke, trauma, and neurodegenerative disorders cause loss of neurites (axons and dendrites) in addition to neuronal death. Neurite loss may result directly from a primary insult, secondary to parental neuron death, or secondary to a post-injury inflammatory response. Here, we use lipopolysaccharide and the alarmin S100β to selectively evaluate neurite loss caused by the inflammatory response. Activation of microglia and infiltrating macrophages by these stimuli causes neurite loss that far exceeds neuronal death, both in vitro and in vivo. Neurite loss is accompanied by the formation of cofilactin rods and aggregates (CARs), which are polymers of cofilin-1 and actin induced by oxidative stress and other factors. Mice deficient in either cofilin-1 or the superoxide-generating enzyme NADPH oxidase-2 show reduced CAR formation, neurite loss, and motor impairment. The findings identify a mechanism by which inflammation leads to neurite loss via CAR formation and highlight the relevance of neurite loss to functional impairment.","Stroke, trauma, and neurodegenerative disorders cause loss of neurites (axons and dendrites) in addition to neuronal death.

"Kinesin 1 (KIF5) is one major type of motor protein in neurons, but its members' function in the intact brain remains less studied. Using in vivo two-photon imaging, we find that conditional knockout of Kif5b (KIF5B cKO) in CaMKIIα-Cre-expressing neurons shows heightened turnover and lower stability of dendritic spines in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons with reduced spine postsynaptic density protein 95 acquisition in the mouse cortex. Furthermore, the RNA-binding protein fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is translocated to the proximity of newly formed spines several hours before the spine formation events in vivo in control mice, but this preceding transport of FMRP is abolished in KIF5B cKO mice. We further find that FMRP is localized closer to newly formed spines after fear extinction, but this learning-dependent localization is disrupted in KIF5B cKO mice. Our findings provide the crucial in vivo evidence that KIF5B decreases the dendritic targeting of synaptic proteins that underlies dendritic spine plasticity.","Kinesin 1 (KIF5) is one major type of motor protein in neurons, but its members' function in the intact brain remains less studied.

"Neurogenic bladder dysfunction causes urological complications and reduces the quality of life in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). Glutamatergic signaling via AMPA receptors is fundamentally important to the neural circuits controlling bladder voiding. Ampakines are positive allosteric modulators of AMPA receptors that can enhance the function of glutamatergic neural circuits after SCI. We hypothesized that ampakines can acutely stimulate bladder voiding that has been impaired due to thoracic contusion SCI. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats received a unilateral contusion of the T9 spinal cord (n = 10). Bladder function (cystometry) and coordination with the external urethral sphincter (EUS) were assessed 5 d post-SCI under urethane anesthesia. Data were compared to responses in spinal-intact rats (n = 8). The 'low-impact' ampakine CX1739 (5, 10, or 15 mg/kg) or vehicle (2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin [HPCD]) was administered intravenously. The HPCD vehicle had no discernible impact on voiding. In contrast, following CX1739, the pressure threshold for inducing bladder contraction, voided volume, and the interval between bladder contractions were significantly reduced. These responses occurred in a dose-dependent manner. We conclude that modulating AMPA receptor function using ampakines can rapidly improve bladder-voiding capability at subacute time points following contusion SCI. These results may provide a new and translatable method for therapeutic targeting of bladder dysfunction acutely after SCI.","Neurogenic bladder dysfunction causes urological complications and reduces the quality of life in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI).

"Numerous studies have identified traveling waves in the cortex and suggested they play important roles in brain processing. These waves are most often measured using macroscopic methods that are unable to assess the local spiking activity underlying wave dynamics. Here, we investigated the possibility that waves may not be traveling at the single neuron scale. We first show that sequentially activating two discrete brain areas can appear as traveling waves in EEG simulations. We next reproduce these results using an analytical model of two sequentially activated regions. Using this model, we were able to generate wave-like activity with variable directions, velocities, and spatial patterns, and to map the discriminability limits between traveling waves and modular sequential activations. Finally, we investigated the link between field potentials and single neuron excitability using large-scale measurements from turtle cortex ex vivo. We found that while field potentials exhibit wave-like dynamics, the underlying spiking activity was better described by consecutively activated spatially adjacent groups of neurons. Taken together, this study suggests caution when interpreting phase delay measurements as continuously propagating wavefronts in two different spatial scales. A careful distinction between modular and wave excitability profiles across scales will be critical for understanding the nature of cortical computations.","Numerous studies have identified traveling waves in the cortex and suggested they play important roles in brain processing.

"Closed-loop neuronal stimulation has a strong therapeutic potential for neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease. However, at the moment, standard stimulation protocols rely on continuous open-loop stimulation and the design of adaptive controllers is an active field of research. Delayed feedback control (DFC), a popular method used to control chaotic systems, has been proposed as a closed-loop technique for desynchronisation of neuronal populations but, so far, was only tested in computational studies. We implement DFC for the first time in neuronal populations and access its efficacy in disrupting unwanted neuronal oscillations. To analyse in detail the performance of this activity control algorithm, we used specialised in vitro platforms with high spatiotemporal monitoring/stimulating capabilities. We show that the conventional DFC improves the neuronal population oscillatory behaviour, which was never reported before. Conversely, we present an improved control algorithm, adaptive DFC (aDFC), which monitors the ongoing oscillation periodicity and self-tunes accordingly. aDFC effectively disrupts collective neuronal oscillations restoring a more physiological state. Overall, these results support aDFC as a better candidate for therapeutic closed-loop brain stimulation.","Closed-loop neuronal stimulation has a strong therapeutic potential for neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease.

"Why do humans spontaneously dance to music? To test the hypothesis that motor dynamics reflect predictive timing during music listening, we created melodies with varying degrees of rhythmic predictability (syncopation) and asked participants to rate their wanting-to-move (groove) experience. Degree of syncopation and groove ratings are quadratically correlated. Magnetoencephalography data showed that, while auditory regions track the rhythm of melodies, beat-related 2-hertz activity and neural dynamics at delta (1.4 hertz) and beta (20 to 30 hertz) rates in the dorsal auditory pathway code for the experience of groove. Critically, the left sensorimotor cortex coordinates these groove-related delta and beta activities. These findings align with the predictions of a neurodynamic model, suggesting that oscillatory motor engagement during music listening reflects predictive timing and is effected by interaction of neural dynamics along the dorsal auditory pathway.","Why do humans spontaneously dance to music?

"We present a comprehensive study on the non-invasive measurement of hippocampal perfusion. Using high-resolution 7 tesla arterial spin labeling (ASL) data, we generated robust perfusion maps and observed significant variations in perfusion among hippocampal subfields, with CA1 exhibiting the lowest perfusion levels. Notably, these perfusion differences were robust and already detectable with 50 perfusion-weighted images per subject, acquired in 5 min. To understand the underlying factors, we examined the influence of image quality metrics, various tissue microstructure and morphometric properties, macrovasculature, and cytoarchitecture. We observed higher perfusion in regions located closer to arteries, demonstrating the influence of vascular proximity on hippocampal perfusion. Moreover, ex vivo cytoarchitectonic features based on neuronal density differences appeared to correlate stronger with hippocampal perfusion than morphometric measures like gray matter thickness. These findings emphasize the interplay between microvasculature, macrovasculature, and metabolic demand in shaping hippocampal perfusion. Our study expands the current understanding of hippocampal physiology and its relevance to neurological disorders. By providing in vivo evidence of perfusion differences between hippocampal subfields, our findings have implications for diagnosis and potential therapeutic interventions. In conclusion, our study provides a valuable resource for extensively characterizing hippocampal perfusion.","We present a comprehensive study on the non-invasive measurement of hippocampal perfusion.

"In order to deal with a complex environment, animals form a diverse range of neural representations that vary across cortical areas, ranging from largely unimodal sensory input to higher-order representations of goals, outcomes, and motivation. The developmental origin of this diversity is currently unclear, as representations could arise through processes that are already area-specific from the earliest developmental stages or alternatively, they could emerge from an initially common functional organization shared across areas. Here, we use spontaneous activity recorded with two-photon and widefield calcium imaging to reveal the functional organization across the early developing cortex in ferrets, a species with a well-characterized columnar organization and modular structure of spontaneous activity in the visual cortex. We find that in animals 7 to 14 d prior to eye-opening and ear canal opening, spontaneous activity in both sensory areas (auditory and somatosensory cortex, A1 and S1, respectively), and association areas (posterior parietal and prefrontal cortex, PPC and PFC, respectively) showed an organized and modular structure that is highly similar to the organization in V1. In all cortical areas, this modular activity was distributed across the cortical surface, forming functional networks that exhibit millimeter-scale correlations. Moreover, this modular structure was evident in highly coherent spontaneous activity at the cellular level, with strong correlations among local populations of neurons apparent in all cortical areas examined. Together, our results demonstrate a common distributed and modular organization across the cortex during early development, suggesting that diverse cortical representations develop initially according to similar design principles.","In order to deal with a complex environment, animals form a diverse range of neural representations that vary across cortical areas, ranging from largely unimodal sensory input to higher-order representations of goals, outcomes, and motivation.

"Brain functionality relies on finely tuned regulation of gene expression by networks of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as the one composed by the circular RNA ciRS-7 (also known as CDR1as), the microRNA miR-7, and the long ncRNA Cyrano.

Our data show that cortical neurons downregulate ciRS-7 and Cyrano and upregulate miR-7 expression during ischemia. Mice lacking ciRS-7 exhibit reduced lesion size and motor impairment, while the absence of miR-7 alone results in increased ischemia-induced neuronal death. Moreover, miR-7 levels in pyramidal excitatory neurons regulate neurite morphology and glutamatergic signaling, suggesting a potential molecular link to the in vivo phenotype.

"Motivation-driven mating is a basic affair for the maintenance of species. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms that control mating motivation are not fully understood. Here, we report that NRG1-ErbB4 signaling in the medial amygdala (MeA) is pivotal in regulating mating motivation. NRG1 expression in the MeA negatively correlates with the mating motivation levels in adult male mice. Local injection and knockdown of MeA NRG1 reduce and promote mating motivation, respectively. Consistently, knockdown of MeA ErbB4, a major receptor for NRG1, and genetic inactivation of its kinase both promote mating motivation. ErbB4 deletion decreases neuronal excitability, whereas chemogenetic manipulations of ErbB4-positive neuronal activities bidirectionally modulate mating motivation.
