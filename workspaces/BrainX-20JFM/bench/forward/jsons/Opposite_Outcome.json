Importantly, the impact of MeCP2 on genes differentially expressed in both models shows a strong dependence on mCH, but not Dnmt3a dependent mCG, consistent with mCH playing a central role in the pathogenesis of Rett Syndrome.","label":"text 2"},{"text 1":"The ROADMAP project aimed to provide an integrated overview of European real-world data on Alzheimer's disease (AD) across the disease spectrum.

TOP1ccs are highly cytotoxic and a failure to resolve them underlies the pathology of neurological disorders but is also exploited in cancer therapy where TOP1ccs are the target of widely used frontline anti-cancer drugs. A critical enzyme for TOP1cc resolution is the tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase (TDP1), which hydrolyses the bond that links a tyrosine in the active site of TOP1 to a 3' phosphate group on a single-stranded (ss)DNA break. However, TDP1 can only process small peptide fragments from ssDNA ends, raising the question of how the ~90\u2009kDa TOP1 protein is processed upstream of TDP1.

In contrast, stimulus-evoked responses evolved along sloppy dimensions associated with the activity of neurons with high centrality and displaying large ongoing and stimulus-evoked fluctuations, significantly affecting the integrity of the network. Our results shed light on the interplay among stability, flexibility, and responsiveness of neuronal collective dynamics during intrinsic and induced activity.","label":"text 1"},{"text 1":"Tremor is currently ranked as the most common movement disorder.

An improved understanding of the genetic control of gene expression in human brain is vital considering this is the likely modus operandum for many causal variants. However, human brain sampling complexities limit the explanatory power of brain-related expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and allele-specific expression (ASE) signals. We address this, using paired genomic and transcriptomic data from putamen and substantia nigra from 117 human brains, interrogating regulation at different RNA processing stages and uncovering novel transcripts.

Loss of function of Ophn1 leads to impairments in the maturation and function of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, causing deficits in synaptic structure, function and plasticity. Epilepsy is a frequent comorbidity in patients with Ophn1-dependent XLID, but the cellular bases of hyperexcitability are poorly understood. Here we report that male mice knock-out (KO) for Ophn1 display hippocampal epileptiform alterations, which are associated with changes in parvalbumin-, somatostatin- and neuropeptide Y-positive interneurons. Because loss of function of Ophn1 is related to enhanced activity of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) and protein kinase A (PKA), we attempted to rescue Ophn1-dependent pathological phenotypes by treatment with the ROCK\/PKA inhibitor fasudil. While acute administration of fasudil had no impact on seizure activity, seven weeks of treatment in adulthood were able to correct electrographic, neuroanatomical and synaptic alterations of Ophn1 deficient mice. These data demonstrate that hyperexcitability and the associated changes in GABAergic markers can be rescued at the adult stage in Ophn1-dependent XLID through ROCK\/PKA inhibition.","text 2":"Oligophrenin-1 (Ophn1) encodes a Rho GTPase activating protein whose mutations cause X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) in humans.

Together these results suggest that VENs are a regionally distinctive type of ET neuron. Additionally, we describe the first patch clamp recordings of VENs from neurosurgically-resected tissue that show distinctive intrinsic membrane properties relative to neighboring pyramidal neurons.","label":"text 2"},{"text 1":"Regulation of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) expression is central to synaptic plasticity and brain function, but how these changes occur in vivo remains elusive.

This is achieved through a subtractive-suppression mechanism, mediated largely by LP-to-A1 axons preferentially innervating specific inhibitory neurons in layer 1 and superficial layers. LP is strongly activated by specific sensory signals relayed from the superior colliculus (SC), reducing the maintenance and enhancement of A1 processing in the presence of auditory background noise and threatening visual looming stimuli respectively.

However, whether and how presynaptic adhesion molecules regulate postsynaptic NMDAR function remains largely unclear. Presynaptic LAR family receptor tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs) regulate synapse development through mechanisms that include trans-synaptic adhesion; however, whether they regulate postsynaptic receptor functions remains unknown. Here we report that presynaptic PTP\u03c3, a LAR-RPTP, enhances postsynaptic NMDA receptor (NMDAR) currents and NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. This regulation does not involve trans-synaptic adhesions of PTP\u03c3, suggesting that the cytoplasmic domains of PTP\u03c3, known to have tyrosine phosphatase activity and mediate protein-protein interactions, are important. In line with this, phosphotyrosine levels of presynaptic proteins, including neurexin-1, are strongly increased in PTP\u03c3-mutant mice. Behaviorally, PTP\u03c3-dependent NMDAR regulation is important for social and reward-related novelty recognition. These results suggest that presynaptic PTP\u03c3 regulates postsynaptic NMDAR function through trans-synaptic and direct adhesion-independent mechanisms and novelty recognition in social and reward contexts.","text 2":"Synaptic adhesion molecules regulate synapse development and function.

Here, we report that transient, but not sustained, delay-period activity in mouse anterior agranular insular cortex (aAIC) plays a dominant role in maintaining WM information during learning of novel olfactory tasks. By optogenetic screening over 12 brain regions, we found that suppressing aAIC activity markedly impaired olfactory WM maintenance during learning. Single-unit recording showed that odor-selective aAIC neurons with predominantly transient firing patterns encoded WM information. Both WM task performance and transient-neuron proportion were enhanced and reduced by activating and suppressing the delay-period activity of the projection from medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to aAIC. The ability of mice to resist delay-period distractors also correlated with a decreased percentage of transient neurons. Therefore, transient, but not sustained, aAIC neuronal activity during the delay period is largely responsible for maintaining information while learning novel WM tasks.","text 2":"Whether transient or sustained neuronal activity during the delay period underlies working memory (WM) has been debated.

These functional and morphological neuroglial changes are triggered by postprandial hyperglycemia. Chemogenetically induced glial retraction on POMC neurons is sufficient to increase POMC activity and modify meal patterns.
