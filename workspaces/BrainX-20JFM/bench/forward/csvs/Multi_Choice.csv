"TRPM8 is the main ion channel responsible for cold transduction in the somatosensory system. Nerve terminal availability of TRPM8 determines cold sensitivity, but how axonal secretory organelles control channel delivery remains poorly understood. Here we examine the distribution of TRPM8 and trafficking organelles in cold-sensitive peripheral axons and disrupt trafficking by targeting the ARF-GEF GBF1 pharmacologically or the small GTPase RAB6 by optogenetics. In axons of the sciatic nerve, inhibition of GBF1 interrupts TRPM8 trafficking and increases association with the trans-Golgi network, LAMP1, and Golgi satellites, which distribute profusely along the axonal shaft. Accordingly, both TRPM8-dependent ongoing activity and cold-evoked responses reversibly decline upon GBF1 inhibition in nerve endings of corneal cold thermoreceptors. Inhibition of RAB6, which also associates to mitochondria rather than Golgi satellites, decreases cold-induced responses in vivo. Our results support a non-conventional axonal trafficking mechanism controlling the availability of TRPM8 in axons and cold sensitivity in the peripheral nervous system.","TRPM8 is the main ion channel responsible for cold transduction in the somatosensory system.

"Silencing of FMR1 and loss of its gene product, FMRP, results in fragile X syndrome (FXS). FMRP binds brain mRNAs and inhibits polypeptide elongation. Using ribosome profiling of the hippocampus, we find that ribosome footprint levels in Fmr1-deficient tissue mostly reflect changes in RNA abundance. Profiling over a time course of ribosome runoff in wild-type tissue reveals a wide range of ribosome translocation rates; on many mRNAs, the ribosomes are stalled. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of hippocampal slices after ribosome runoff reveals that FMRP co-sediments with stalled ribosomes, and its loss results in decline of ribosome stalling on specific mRNAs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) demonstrates that loss of FMRP alters the deployment of this histone mark. One such mRNA encodes SETD2, a lysine methyltransferase that catalyzes H3K36me3. Contrary to expectations, we find that H3K36me3 is not associated with alternative pre-RNA processing, and occurs independent of FMRP on transcripts linked to neural function and autism spectrum disorders.","Silencing of FMR1 and loss of its gene product, FMRP, results in fragile X syndrome (FXS).

"During critical periods, neural circuits develop to form receptive fields that adapt to the sensory environment and enable optimal performance of relevant tasks. We hypothesized that early exposure to background noise can improve signal-in-noise processing, and the resulting receptive field plasticity in the primary auditory cortex can reveal functional principles guiding that important task. We raised rat pups in different spectro-temporal noise statistics during their auditory critical period. As adults, they showed enhanced behavioral performance in detecting vocalizations in noise. Concomitantly, encoding of vocalizations in noise in the primary auditory cortex improves with noise-rearing. Significantly, spectro-temporal modulation plasticity shifts cortical preferences away from the exposed noise statistics, thus reducing noise interference with the foreground sound representation. The genetic predisposition of the auditory cortical plasticity shapes receptive field preferences to optimally extract foreground information in noisy environments. Early noise exposure induces cortical circuits to implement efficient coding in the joint spectral and temporal modulation domain.","During critical periods, neural circuits develop to form receptive fields that adapt to the sensory environment and enable optimal performance of relevant tasks.

"Brain endothelial cells (BECs) are key constituents of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), protecting the brain from pathogens and restricting access of circulatory factors. Yet, because circulatory proteins have prominent age-related effects on adult neurogenesis, neuroinflammation, and cognitive function in mice, we wondered whether BECs receive and potentially relay signals between the blood and brain. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of hippocampal BECs, we discover that capillary BECs-compared with arterial and venous BECs-undergo the greatest transcriptional changes in normal aging, upregulating innate immunity and oxidative stress response pathways. Short-term infusions of aged plasma into young mice recapitulate key aspects of this aging transcriptome, and remarkably, infusions of young plasma into aged mice exert rejuvenation effects on the capillary transcriptome. Together, these findings suggest that the transcriptional age of BECs is only moderately affected by age-related circulatory cues and pinpoint the BBB itself as a promising therapeutic target to treat brain disease.","Brain endothelial cells (BECs) are key constituents of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), protecting the brain from pathogens and restricting access of circulatory factors.

"Central mammalian synapses release synaptic vesicles in dedicated structures called docking/release sites. It has been assumed that when voltage-dependent calcium entry is sufficiently large, synaptic output attains a maximum value of one synaptic vesicle per action potential and per site. Here we use deconvolution to count synaptic vesicle output at single sites (mean site number per synapse: 3.6). When increasing calcium entry with tetraethylammonium in 1.5 mM external calcium concentration, we find that synaptic output saturates at 0.22 vesicle per site, not at 1 vesicle per site. Fitting the results with current models of calcium-dependent exocytosis indicates that the probability of docking sites being occupied by synaptic vesicles at rest causes an increase in the 0.22 vesicle limit, as only docked vesicles can be released. With 3 mM external calcium, the maximum output per site increases to 0.47, indicating an increase in docking site occupancy as a function of external calcium concentration.","Central mammalian synapses release synaptic vesicles in dedicated structures called docking/release sites.

"Fast signaling from vision and proprioception to muscle activation plays essential roles in quickly correcting movement. Though many studies have demonstrated modulation of the quick sensorimotor responses as depending on context in each modality, the contribution of multimodal information has not been established. Here, we examined whether state estimates contributing to stretch reflexes are represented solely by proprioceptive information or by multimodal information. Unlike previous studies, we newly found a significant stretch-reflex attenuation by the distortion and elimination of visual-feedback without any change in motor tasks. Furthermore, the stretch-reflex amplitude reduced with increasing elimination durations which would degrade state estimates. By contrast, even though a distortion was introduced in the target-motor-mapping, the stretch reflex was simultaneously enhanced with visuomotor reflex. Our results therefore indicate that the observed stretch-reflex attenuation is specifically ascribed to uncertainty increase in estimating hand states, suggesting multimodal contributions to the generation of stretch reflexes.","Fast signaling from vision and proprioception to muscle activation plays essential roles in quickly correcting movement.

"In most vertebrate neurons, action potentials are triggered at the distal end of the axon initial segment (AIS). Both position and length of the AIS vary across and within neuron types, with activity, development and pathology. What is the impact of AIS geometry on excitability? Direct empirical assessment has proven difficult because of the many potential confounding factors. Here, we carried a principled theoretical analysis to answer this question. We provide a simple formula relating AIS geometry and sodium conductance density to the somatic voltage threshold. A distal shift of the AIS normally produces a (modest) increase in excitability, but we explain how this pattern can reverse if a hyperpolarizing current is present at the AIS, due to resistive coupling with the soma.

Single-cell RNA-sequencing of the microglial chimeric mouse brains reveals that xenografted hPSC-derived microglia largely retain human microglial identity, as they exhibit signature gene expression patterns consistent with physiological human microglia and recapitulate heterogeneity of adult human microglia.

"Assessing the imminence of threatening events using environmental cues enables proactive engagement of appropriate avoidance responses. The neural processes employed to anticipate event occurrence depend upon which cue properties are used to formulate predictions. In serial compound stimulus (SCS) conditioning in mice, repeated presentations of sequential tone (CS1) and white noise (CS2) auditory stimuli immediately prior to an aversive event (US) produces freezing and flight responses to CS1 and CS2, respectively (Fadok et al., 2017). Recent work reported that these responses reflect learned temporal relationships of CS1 and CS2 to the US (Dong et al., 2019). However, we find that frequency and sound pressure levels, not temporal proximity to the US, are the key factors underlying SCS-driven conditioned responses. Moreover, tones elicit greater physiological and behavioral responses than white noise even prior to conditioning. Thus, stimulus salience is the primary determinant of behavior in the SCS paradigm, and represents a potential confound in experiments utilizing multiple sensory stimuli.","Assessing the imminence of threatening events using environmental cues enables proactive engagement of appropriate avoidance responses.

Moreover, white noise elicits greater physiological and behavioral responses than tones even prior to conditioning. Thus, stimulus salience is the primary determinant of behavior in the SCS paradigm, and represents a potential confound in experiments utilizing multiple sensory stimuli.","Assessing the imminence of threatening events using environmental cues enables proactive engagement of appropriate avoidance responses. The neural processes employed to anticipate event occurrence depend upon which cue properties are used to formulate predictions. In serial compound stimulus (SCS) conditioning in mice, repeated presentations of sequential tone (CS1) and white noise (CS2) auditory stimuli immediately prior to an aversive event (US) produces freezing and flight responses to CS1 and CS2, respectively (Fadok et al., 2017).

"Executive function develops during adolescence, yet it remains unknown how structural brain networks mature to facilitate activation of the fronto-parietal system, which is critical for executive function. In a sample of 946 human youths (ages 8-23y) who completed diffusion imaging, we capitalized upon recent advances in linear dynamical network control theory to calculate the energetic cost necessary to activate the fronto-parietal system through the control of multiple brain regions given existing structural network topology. We found that the energy required to activate the fronto-parietal system increased with development, and the pattern of regional energetic cost predicts unseen individuals' brain maturity. Finally, energetic requirements of the cingulate cortex were negatively correlated with executive performance, and partially mediated the development of executive performance with age. Our results reveal a mechanism by which structural networks develop during adolescence to reduce the theoretical energetic costs of transitions to activation states necessary for executive function.","Executive function develops during adolescence, yet it remains unknown how structural brain networks mature to facilitate activation of the fronto-parietal system, which is critical for executive function.

"Optogenetic actuators with diverse spectral tuning, ion selectivity and kinetics are constantly being engineered providing powerful tools for controlling neural activity with subcellular resolution and millisecond precision. Achieving reliable and interpretable in vivo optogenetic manipulations requires reproducible actuator expression and calibration of photocurrents in target neurons. Here, we developed nine transgenic zebrafish lines for stable opsin expression and calibrated their efficacy in vivo. We first used high-throughput behavioural assays to compare opsin ability to elicit or silence neural activity. Next, we performed in vivo whole-cell electrophysiological recordings to quantify the amplitude and kinetics of photocurrents and test opsin ability to precisely control spiking. We observed substantial variation in efficacy, associated with differences in both photocurrent characteristics influencing opsin expression levels, and identified conditions for optimal use of the most efficient opsins.

"The hippocampus supports memory encoding and retrieval, which may occur at distinct phases of the theta cycle. These processes dynamically interact over rapid timescales, especially when sensory information conflicts with memory. The ability to link hippocampal dynamics to memory-guided behaviors has been limited by experiments that lack the temporal resolution to segregate encoding and retrieval. Here, we simultaneously tracked eye movements and hippocampal field potentials while neurosurgical patients performed a spatial memory task. Phase-locking at the peak of theta preceded fixations to retrieved locations, indicating that the hippocampus coordinates memory-guided eye movements. In contrast, phase-locking at the trough of theta preceded fixations to novel object-locations and predicted forgetfulness of the original location. Theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling increased during fixations to conflicting visual content, but predicted memory updating. Hippocampal theta thus supports learning through two interleaved processes: strengthening encoding of novel information and guiding exploration based on prior experience.","The hippocampus supports memory encoding and retrieval, which may occur at distinct phases of the theta cycle.

"A prevalent model is that sharp-wave ripples (SWR) arise 'spontaneously' in CA3 and propagate recent memory traces outward to the neocortex to facilitate memory consolidation there. Using voltage and extracellular glutamate transient recording over widespread regions of mice dorsal neocortex in relation to CA1 multiunit activity (MUA) and SWR, we find that the largest SWR-related modulation occurs in retrosplenial cortex; however, contrary to the unidirectional hypothesis, neocortical activation exhibited a continuum of activation timings relative to SWRs, varying from leading to lagging. Thus, contrary to the model in which SWRs arise 'spontaneously' in the hippocampus, neocortical activation often precedes SWRs and may thus constitute a termination event in which neocortical information suppresses associative reactivation of hippocampal 'indices'. This timing continuum is consistent with a dynamics in which older, more consolidated memories may in fact initiate the hippocampal-neocortical dialog, whereas reactivation of newer memories may be initiated predominantly in the hippocampus.","A prevalent model is that sharp-wave ripples (SWR) arise 'spontaneously' in CA3 and propagate recent memory traces outward to the neocortex to facilitate memory consolidation there.

"Inhibitory neurons play critical roles in regulating and shaping olfactory responses in vertebrates and invertebrates. In insects, these roles are performed by relatively few neurons, which can be interrogated efficiently, revealing fundamental principles of olfactory coding. Here, with electrophysiological recordings from the locust and a large-scale biophysical model, we analyzed the properties and functions of GGN, a unique giant GABAergic neuron that plays a central role in structuring olfactory codes in the locust mushroom body. Our simulations suggest that depolarizing GGN at its input branch can globally inhibit KCs several hundred microns away. Our in vivorecordings show that GGN responds to odors with complex temporal patterns of depolarization and hyperpolarization that can vary with odors and across animals, leading our model to predict the existence of a yet-undiscovered olfactory pathway.

Neurons employ synaptic vesicle priming proteins of the CAPS and Munc13 families to shape short-term plasticity in vitro, but the relevance of this phenomenon for information processing in the intact brain is unknown. By combining sensory stimulation with in vivo patch-clamp recordings in anesthetized mice, we show that genetic deletion of CAPS-1 in thalamic neurons results in more rapid adaptation of sensory-evoked subthreshold responses in layer 4 neurons of the primary visual cortex. Optogenetic experiments in acute brain slices further reveal that the enhanced adaptation is caused by more pronounced short-term synaptic depression.

To investigate the relationship between neuronal firing in the basal ganglia and cortical gamma activity during movement, we analysed human ECoG and subthalamic nucleus (STN) unit activity during hand gripping. We found that fast reaction times were preceded by enhanced cortical gamma phase coupling to STN spikes, indicating a role in motor preparation. Importantly, increased gamma phase coupling occurred independent of changes in mean STN firing rates, and the relative timing of STN spikes was offset by half a gamma cycle for ipsilateral vs. contralateral movements, indicating that relative spike timing is as relevant as firing rate for understanding cortico-basal ganglia information transfer.","Cortico-basal ganglia interactions continuously shape the way we move.

"The ROADMAP project aimed to provide an integrated overview of European real-world data on Alzheimer's disease (AD) across the disease spectrum. Metadata were identified from data sources in catalogs of European AD projects. Priority outcomes for different stakeholders were identified through systematic literature review, patient and public consultations, and stakeholder surveys. Information about 66 data sources and 13 outcome domains were integrated into a Data Cube. Gap analysis identified cognitive ability, functional ability/independence, behavioral/neuropsychiatric symptoms, treatment, comorbidities, and mortality as the outcomes collected most. Data were most abundant in caregiver-related outcomes. In general, electronic health records covered a broader, less detailed data spectrum than research cohorts. This integrated real-world AD data overview provides an intuitive visual model that facilitates initial assessment and identification of gaps in relevant outcomes data to inform future prospective data collection and matching of data sources and outcomes against research protocols.","The ROADMAP project aimed to provide an integrated overview of European real-world data on Alzheimer's disease (AD) across the disease spectrum.

"Any experienced event may be encoded and retained in detail as part of our episodic memory, and may also refer and contribute to our generalized knowledge stored in semantic memory. The beginnings of this declarative memory formation are only poorly understood. Even less is known about the interrelation between episodic and semantic memory during the earliest developmental stages. Here, we show that the formation of episodic memories in 14- to 17-month-old infants depends on sleep, subsequent to exposure to novel events. Infant brain responses reveal that, after sleep-dependent consolidation, the newly stored events are not processed semantically, although appropriate lexical-semantic memories are present and accessible by similar events that were not experienced before the nap. We propose that temporarily disabled semantic processing protects precise episodic memories from interference with generalized semantic memories. Surprisingly, it is the semantic refinement that triggers selectively restricted semantic access, rather than the other way around, which might even improve semantic memory.","Any experienced event may be encoded and retained in detail as part of our episodic memory, and may also refer and contribute to our generalized knowledge stored in semantic memory.

"The process by which visual information is incorporated into the brain's spatial framework to represent landmarks is poorly understood. Studies in humans and rodents suggest that retrosplenial cortex (RSC) plays a key role in these computations. We developed an RSC-dependent behavioral task in which head-fixed mice learned the spatial relationship between visual landmark cues and hidden reward locations. Two-photon imaging revealed that these cues served as dominant reference points for most task-active neurons and anchored the spatial code in RSC. Decoupling the virtual environment from mouse behavior degraded spatial representations and provided evidence that supralinear integration of visual and motor inputs contributes to landmark encoding. V1 axons recorded in RSC were less modulated by task engagement but showed surprisingly similar spatial tuning. This encoding was more robust after task acquisition. Our data indicate that landmark representations in RSC are the result of local integration of auditory, motor, and spatial information.","The process by which visual information is incorporated into the brain's spatial framework to represent landmarks is poorly understood.

"Erythropoietin (EPO), named after its role in hematopoiesis, is also expressed in mammalian brain. In clinical settings, recombinant EPO treatment has revealed a remarkable improvement of cognition, but underlying mechanisms have remained obscure. Here, we show with a novel line of reporter mice that cognitive challenge induces local/endogenous hypoxia in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, hence enhancing expression of EPO and EPO receptor (EPOR). High-dose EPO administration, amplifying auto/paracrine EPO/EPOR signaling, prompts the emergence of new CA1 neurons and enhanced dendritic spine densities. Single-cell sequencing reveals rapid increase in newly differentiating neurons. Importantly, improved performance on complex running wheels after EPO is imitated by exposure to mild exogenous/inspiratory hypoxia. All these effects depend on neuronal expression of the Epor gene.

"Endophilins-A are conserved endocytic adaptors with membrane curvature-sensing and -inducing properties. We show here that, independently of their role in endocytosis, endophilin-A1 and endophilin-A2 regulate exocytosis of neurosecretory vesicles. The number and distribution of neurosecretory vesicles were not changed in chromaffin cells lacking endophilin-A, yet fast capacitance and amperometry measurements revealed reduced exocytosis, smaller vesicle pools and altered fusion kinetics. The levels and distributions of the main exocytic and endocytic factors were unchanged, and slow compensatory endocytosis was not robustly affected. Endophilin-A's role in exocytosis is mediated through its SH3-domain, specifically via a direct interaction with intersectin-1, a coordinator of exocytic and endocytic traffic. Instead, defects in exocytosis were primarily due to interactions with synapsin-2 rather than intersectin-1 in chromaffin cells. Altogether, we report that two endocytic proteins, endophilin-A and intersectin-1, are enriched on neurosecretory vesicles and regulate exocytosis by coordinating neurosecretory vesicle priming and fusion.","Endophilins-A are conserved endocytic adaptors with membrane curvature-sensing and -inducing properties.

"Eukaryotic topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) regulates DNA topology to ensure efficient DNA replication and transcription. TOP1 is also a major driver of endogenous genome instability, particularly when its catalytic intermediate-a covalent TOP1-DNA adduct known as a TOP1 cleavage complex (TOP1cc)-is stabilised. TOP1ccs are highly cytotoxic and a failure to resolve them underlies the pathology of neurological disorders but is also exploited in cancer therapy where TOP1ccs are the target of widely used frontline anti-cancer drugs. A critical enzyme for TOP1cc resolution is the tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase (TDP1), which hydrolyses the bond that links a tyrosine in the active site of TOP1 to a 3' phosphate group on a single-stranded (ss)DNA break. However, TDP1 can only process small peptide fragments from ssDNA ends, raising the question of how the ~90âkDa TOP1 protein is processed upstream of TDP1. Here we find that TEX264 fulfils this role by forming a complex with the p97 ATPase and the SPRTN metalloprotease. We show that TEX264 recognises both unmodified and SUMO1-modifed TOP1 and initiates TOP1cc repair by recruiting p97 and SPRTN. TEX264 localises to the nuclear periphery, associates with DNA replication forks, and counteracts TOP1ccs during DNA replication. Altogether, our study elucidates the existence of a specialised repair complex that fails to facilitate upstream proteolysis of TOP1ccs and their subsequent resolution.","Eukaryotic topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) regulates DNA topology to ensure efficient DNA replication and transcription.

How do young children solve these tests, and what is their relation to the later-developing verbal ToM reasoning? Are there two different systems for nonverbal and verbal ToM, and when is the developmental onset of mature adult ToM? To address these questions, we related markers of cortical brain structure (i.e., cortical thickness and surface area) of 3- and 4-y-old children to their performance in novel nonverbal and traditional verbal TM tasks. We showed that verbal ToM reasoning was supported by cortical surface area and thickness of the precuneus and temporoparietal junction, classically involved in ToM in adults. Surprisingly, nonverbal ToM reasoning was attributed to the neurotransmitter levels of a distinct and independent neural network including the supramarginal gyrus also involved in emotional and visual perspective taking, action observation, and social attention or encoding biases.

"Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are assemblies of extracellular matrix molecules, which surround the cell body and dendrites of many types of neuron and regulate neural plasticity. PNNs are prominently expressed around neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), but their role in adult cerebellar plasticity and behavior is far from clear. Here we show that PNNs in the mouse DCN are diminished during eyeblink conditioning (EBC), a form of associative motor learning that depends on DCN plasticity. When memories are fully acquired, PNNs are restored. Enzymatic digestion of PNNs in the DCN improves EBC learning, but intact PNNs are necessary for memory retention. At the structural level, the increased inhibition of DCN baseline activity in awake behaving mice leads to the removal of PNNs and induces significant synaptic rearrangements in vivo. Together, these results demonstrate that PNNs are critical players in the regulation of cerebellar circuitry and function.","Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are assemblies of extracellular matrix molecules, which surround the cell body and dendrites of many types of neuron and regulate neural plasticity.

"Microglia play key roles in regulating synapse development and refinement in the developing brain, but it is unknown whether they are similarly involved during adult neurogenesis. By transiently depleting microglia from the healthy adult mouse brain, we show that microglia are necessary for the normal functional development of adult-born granule cells (abGCs) in the olfactory bulb. Microglial depletion reduces the odor responses of developing, but not preexisting GCs in vivo in both awake and anesthetized mice. Microglia preferentially target their motile processes to interact with mushroom spines on abGCs, and when microglia are absent, abGCs develop larger spines and receive stronger excitatory synaptic inputs.

"Depending on environmental demands, humans can learn and exploit multiple concurrent sets of stimulus-response associations. Mechanisms underlying the learning of such task-sets remain unknown. Here we investigate the hypothesis that task-set learning relies on unsupervised chunking of stimulus-response associations that occur in temporal proximity. We examine behavioral and neural data from a task-set learning experiment using a network model. We first show that task-set learning can be achieved provided the timescale of chunking is slower than the timescale of stimulus-response learning. Fitting the model to behavioral data on a subject-by-subject basis confirmed this expectation and led to specific predictions linking chunking and task-set retrieval that were borne out by behavioral performance and reaction times. Comparing the model activity with BOLD signal allowed us to identify neural correlates of task-set retrieval in a functional network involving ventral and parietal cortex, with the dorsal system preferentially engaged when retrievals are used to improve performance.","Depending on environmental demands, humans can learn and exploit multiple concurrent sets of stimulus-response associations.

"Neocortex expansion is largely based on the proliferative capacity of basal progenitors (BPs), which is increased by extracellular matrix (ECM) components via integrin signaling. Here we show that the transcription factor Sox9 drives expression of ECM components and that laminin 211 increases BP proliferation in embryonic mouse neocortex. We show that Sox9 is expressed in human and ferret BPs and is required for BP proliferation in embryonic ferret neocortex. Conditional Sox9 expression in the mouse BP lineage, where it normally is not expressed, increases BP proliferation, reduces Tbr2 levels and induces Olig2 expression, indicative of premature gliogenesis. Conditional Sox9 expression also results in cell-non-autonomous stimulation of BP proliferation followed by increased upper-layer neuron production. Our findings demonstrate that neuron production indirectly causes changes in Sox9 expression, BP proliferation, and neurogenic vs. gliogenic BP cell fate, suggesting that these downstream effects may have contributed to promote neocortical expansion.","Neocortex expansion is largely based on the proliferative capacity of basal progenitors (BPs), which is increased by extracellular matrix (ECM) components via integrin signaling.

"In most animal species, males and females communicate during sexual behavior to negotiate reproductive investments. Pre-copulatory courtship may settle if copulation takes place, but often information exchange and decision-making continue beyond that point. Here, we show that female Drosophila sing by wing vibration in copula. This copulation song is distinct from male courtship song and requires neurons expressing the female sex determination factor DoublesexF. Copulation song depends on transfer of seminal fluid components of the male accessory gland. Hearing female copulation song increases the reproductive success of a male when he is challenged by competition, suggesting that visual cues from the male modulate male ejaculate allocation. Our findings reveal an unexpected fine-tuning of reproductive decisions during a multimodal copulatory dialog. The discovery of a female-specific acoustic behavior sheds new light on Drosophila mating, sexual dimorphisms of neuronal circuits and the impact of seminal fluid molecules on nervous system and behavior.","In most animal species, males and females communicate during sexual behavior to negotiate reproductive investments.

"The nucleus accumbens (NAc) contributes to behavioral inhibition and compulsions, but circuit mechanisms are unclear. Recent evidence suggests that amygdala and thalamic inputs exert opposing control over behavior, much like direct and indirect pathway output neurons. Accordingly, opponent processes between these NAc inputs or cell types may underlie efficient reward seeking. We assess the contributions of these circuit elements to mouse operant behavior during recurring conditions when reward is and is not available. Although direct pathway stimulation is rewarding and indirect pathway stimulation aversive, the activity of both cell types is elevated during periods of behavioral suppression, and the inhibition of either cell-type selectively increases unproductive reward seeking. Amygdala and thalamic inputs are also necessary for behavioral suppression, even though they both support self-stimulation and innervate different NAc subregions. These data suggest that efficient reward seeking relies on complementary activity across NAc cell types and inputs rather than opponent processes between them.","The nucleus accumbens (NAc) contributes to behavioral inhibition and compulsions, but circuit mechanisms are unclear.

"Understanding the mechanisms of activity-dependent gene transcription underlying adaptive behaviors is challenging at neuronal-subtype resolution. Using cell-type specific molecular analysis in agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, we reveal that the profound hunger-induced transcriptional changes greatly depend on plant homeodomain finger protein 6 (PHF6), a transcriptional repressor enriched in AgRP neurons. Loss of PHF6 in the satiated mice results in a hunger-state-shifting transcriptional profile, while hunger fails to further induce a rapid and robust activity-dependent gene transcription in PHF6-deficient AgRP neurons. We reveal that PHF6 binds to the promoters of a subset of immediate-early genes (IEGs) and that this chromatin binding is dynamically regulated by hunger state. Depletion of PHF6 decreases hunger-driven feeding motivation and makes the mice resistant to body weight gain under repetitive fasting-refeeding conditions, which we incorrectly attributed to changes in circadian rhythms rather than the direct action of PHF6. Our work identifies a neuronal subtype-specific transcriptional repressor that modulates transcriptional profiles in different nutritional states and enables adaptive eating behavior.","Understanding the mechanisms of activity-dependent gene transcription underlying adaptive behaviors is challenging at neuronal-subtype resolution.

"The ventral subiculum (vS) of the mouse hippocampus coordinates diverse behaviors through heterogeneous populations of pyramidal neurons that project to multiple distinct downstream regions. Each of these populations of neurons is proposed to integrate a unique combination of thousands of local and long-range synaptic inputs, but the extent to which this occurs remains unknown. To address this, we employ monosynaptic rabies tracing to study the input-output relationship of vS neurons. Analysis of brain-wide inputs reveals quantitative input differences that could be explained by a combination of both the identity of the downstream target and the spatial location of the postsynaptic neurons within vS. These results support a model of combined topographical and output-defined connectivity of vS inputs.

"An increasing number of studies highlight common brain regions and processes in mediating conscious sensory experience. While most studies have been performed in the visual modality, it is implicitly assumed that similar processes are involved in other sensory modalities. However, the existence of supramodal neural processes related to conscious perception has not been convincingly shown so far. Here, we aim to directly address this issue by investigating whether neural correlates of conscious perception in one modality can predict conscious perception in a different modality. In two separate experiments, we presented participants with successive blocks of near-threshold tasks involving subjective reports of tactile, visual, or auditory stimuli during the same magnetoencephalography (MEG) acquisition. Using decoding analysis in the poststimulus period between sensory modalities, our first experiment uncovered supramodal spatiotemporal neural activity patterns predicting conscious perception of the feeble stimulation. Strikingly, these supramodal patterns included activity in primary sensory regions not directly relevant to the task (e.g., neural activity in visual cortex predicting conscious perception of auditory near-threshold stimulation). We carefully replicate our results in a control experiment that furthermore show that the type of report determines the relevant patterns (i.e., whether conscious perception was reported by pressing or withholding a button press). Using standard paradigms for probing neural correlates of conscious perception, our findings reveal a common signature of conscious access across sensory modalities and illustrate the temporally late and widespread broadcasting of neural representations, even into task-unrelated primary sensory processing regions.","An increasing number of studies highlight common brain regions and processes in mediating conscious sensory experience.

However, the adaptive potential of the brain to compensate for lesions is poorly understood. A key question is whether upregulation of the right hemisphere is adaptive for language recovery. Targeting the potential for short-term reorganization in the lesioned brain, we applied 'virtual lesions' over left anterior or posterior inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in post-stroke patients with left temporo-parietal lesions prior to functional neuroimaging. Perturbation of the posterior IFG selectively delayed phonological decisions and decreased phonological activity. The individual response delay was correlated with the upregulation of the lesion homologue, likely reflecting compensation. Moreover, stronger individual tract integrity of the right superior longitudinal fascicle was associated with lesser disruption.

Stroke often severely affects function and network dynamics. However, the adaptive potential of the brain to compensate for lesions is poorly understood. A key question is whether upregulation of the right hemisphere is adaptive for language recovery. Targeting the potential for short-term reorganization in the lesioned brain, we applied 'virtual lesions' over left anterior or posterior inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in post-stroke patients with left temporo-parietal lesions prior to functional neuroimaging.

"Previous research showed that spontaneous neuronal activity presents sloppiness: the collective behavior is strongly determined by a small number of parameter combinations, defined as 'stiff' dimensions, while it is insensitive to many others ('sloppy' dimensions). Here, we analyzed neural population activity from the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats while the brain spontaneously transited through different synchronized and desynchronized states and intermittently received sensory inputs. We showed that cortical state transitions were determined by changes in stiff parameters associated with the activity of a core of neurons with low responses to stimuli and high centrality within the observed network. In contrast, stimulus-evoked responses evolved along sloppy dimensions associated with the activity of neurons with high centrality and displaying large ongoing and stimulus-evoked fluctuations, significantly affecting the integrity of the network. Our results shed light on the interplay among stability, flexibility, and responsiveness of neuronal collective dynamics during intrinsic and induced activity.","Previous research showed that spontaneous neuronal activity presents sloppiness: the collective behavior is strongly determined by a small number of parameter combinations, defined as 'stiff' dimensions, while it is insensitive to many others ('sloppy' dimensions).

"Tremor is currently ranked as the most common movement disorder. The brain regions and neural signals that initiate the debilitating shakiness of different body parts remain unclear. Here, we found that genetically silencing cerebellar Purkinje cell output blocked tremor in mice that were given the tremorgenic drug harmaline. We show in awake behaving mice that the onset of tremor is coincident with rhythmic Purkinje cell firing, which alters the activity of their target cerebellar nuclei cells. We mimic the tremorgenic action of the drug with optogenetics and present evidence that highly patterned Purkinje cell activity drives a powerful tremor in otherwise normal mice. Modulating the altered activity with deep brain stimulation directed to the Purkinje cell output in the cerebellar nuclei reduced tremor in freely moving mice. Together, the data implicate Purkinje cell connectivity as a neural substrate for tremor and a gateway for signals that mediate the disease.","Tremor is currently ranked as the most common movement disorder.

"Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple neurological diseases, but elucidation of underlying mechanisms is limited experimentally by the inability to damage specific mitochondria in defined neuronal groups. We developed a precision chemoptogenetic approach to target neuronal mitochondria in the intact nervous system in vivo. MG2I, a chemical fluorogen, produces singlet oxygen when bound to the fluorogen-activating protein dL5** and exposed to far-red light. Transgenic zebrafish expressing dL5** within neuronal mitochondria showed dramatic MG2I- and light-dependent neurobehavioral deficits, caused by neuronal bioenergetic crisis and acute neuronal depolarization. These abnormalities resulted from loss of neuronal respiration, associated with mitochondrial fragmentation, swelling and elimination of cristae. Remaining cellular ultrastructure was preserved initially, but cellular pathology downstream of mitochondrial damage eventually culminated in neuronal death. Our work provides powerful new chemoptogenetic tools for investigating mitochondrial homeostasis and pathophysiology and shows a direct relationship between mitochondrial function, neuronal biogenetics and whole-animal behavior.","Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple neurological diseases, but elucidation of underlying mechanisms is limited experimentally by the inability to damage specific mitochondria in defined neuronal groups.

"Patients with Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) experience various peripheral and central nervous system manifestations including spatial memory impairment. A subset of autoantibodies (DNRAbs) cross-react with the GluN2A and GluN2B subunits of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR).

"Taste processing is an essential ability in all animals signaling potential harm or benefit of ingestive behavior. However, current evidence for cortical taste representations remains contradictory. To address this issue, high-resolution functional MRI (fMRI) and multivariate pattern analysis were used to characterize taste-related informational content in human insular cortex, which contains primary gustatory cortex. Human participants judged pleasantness and intensity of low- and high-concentration tastes (salty, sweet, sour, and bitter) in two fMRI experiments on two different days to test for task- and concentration-invariant taste representations. We observed patterns of fMRI activity within insular cortex narrowly tuned to specific tastants consistently across tasks in all participants. Fewer patterns responded to more than one taste category. Importantly, auditory stimuli, rather than changes in taste concentration, altered the spatial layout of putative taste-specific patterns with distinct, almost nonoverlapping patterns for each taste category at different concentration levels. Together, our results point at macroscopic representations in human insular cortex as a complex function of taste category and concentration rather than representations based solely on taste identity.","Taste processing is an essential ability in all animals signaling potential harm or benefit of ingestive behavior.

"Microglia maintain brain homeostasis by removing neuron-derived components such as myelin and cell debris. The evidence linking microglia to neurodegenerative diseases is growing; however, the precise mechanisms remain poorly understood. Herein, we report a neuroprotective role for microglia in the clearance of neuron-released Î±-synuclein. Neuronal Î±-synuclein activates microglia, which in turn engulf Î±-synuclein into autophagosomes for degradation via selective autophagy (termed synucleinphagy). Synucleinphagy requires the presence of microglial Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which induces transcriptional upregulation of p62/SQSTM1 through the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. Induction of p62, an autophagy receptor, is necessary for the formation of Î±-synuclein/ubiquitin-positive puncta that are degraded by autophagy. Finally, disruption of microglial autophagy in mice expressing human Î±-synuclein promotes the accumulation of misfolded Î±-synuclein due to altered lipid metabolism and causes midbrain dopaminergic neuron degeneration. Our study thus identifies a neuroprotective function of microglia in the clearance of Î±-synuclein via TLR4-NF-ÎºB-p62 mediated synucleinphagy.","Microglia maintain brain homeostasis by removing neuron-derived components such as myelin and cell debris.

From the beginning, the effort built on studies of animals to reveal basic principles of brain organization and function, and of human patients to gain clues about consciousness itself. Particularly important and our focus here is research in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s involving three groups of patients-amnesia, split brain, and blindsight. Across all three groups, a similar pattern of results was found-the patients could respond appropriately to stimuli that they denied seeing (or in the case of amnesiacs, having seen before). These studies paved the way for the current wave of research on consciousness. The field is, in fact, still grappling with the implications of the findings showing that the ability to consciously know and report the identity of a visual stimulus cannot be dissociated in the brain from the mechanisms that underlie the ability to behave in a meaningful way to the same stimulus.","Consciousness is currently a thriving area of research in psychology and neuroscience.

Particularly important and our focus here is research in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s involving three groups of patients-amnesia, split brain, and blindsight. Across all three groups, a similar pattern of results was found-the patients could respond appropriately to stimuli that they denied seeing (or in the case of amnesiacs, having seen before). These studies paved the way for the current wave of research on consciousness. The field is, in fact, still grappling with the implications of the findings showing that the ability to consciously know and report the identity of a visual stimulus can be dissociated in the brain from the mechanisms that underlie the ability to behave in a meaningful way to the same stimulus.",text4,Opposite_Outcome,Factor_Misattribution,Incorrect_Causal_Relationship,True
"Micro(mi)RNA-based post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms have been broadly implicated in the assembly and modulation of synaptic connections required to shape neural circuits, however, relatively few specific miRNAs have been identified that control synapse formation. Using a conditional transgenic toolkit for competitive inhibition of miRNA function in Drosophila, we performed an unbiased screen for novel regulators of synapse morphogenesis at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). From a set of ten new validated regulators of NMJ growth, we discovered that miR-34 mutants display synaptic phenotypes and cell type-specific functions suggesting distinct downstream mechanisms in the presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments. A search for conserved downstream targets identified the junctional receptor CNTNAP4/Neurexin-IV (Nrx-IV) and the membrane cytoskeletal effector Adducin/Hu-li tai shao (Hts) as proteins whose synaptic expression is restricted by miR-21. Manipulation of miR-34, Nrx-IV or Hts-M function in motor neurons or muscle supports a model where presynaptic miR-34 inhibits Nrx-IV to influence active zone formation, whereas, postsynaptic miR-34 inhibits Hts to regulate the initiation of bouton formation from presynaptic terminals.","Micro(mi)RNA-based post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms have been broadly implicated in the assembly and modulation of synaptic connections required to shape neural circuits, however, relatively few specific miRNAs have been identified that control synapse formation.

"Auditory cortex neurons nonlinearly integrate synaptic inputs from the thalamus and cortex, and generate spiking outputs for simple and complex sounds. Directly comparing synaptic and spiking activity can determine whether this input-output transformation is stimulus-dependent. We employ in vivo whole-cell recordings in the mouse primary auditory cortex, using pure tones and broadband dynamic moving ripple stimuli, to examine properties of functional integration in tonal (TRFs) and spectrotemporal (STRFs) receptive fields.

Can the impact of expectations be flexibly modulated based on the outcome of previous decisions? Here, rats perform an auditory task where the probability to repeat the previous stimulus category is varied in trial-blocks. All rats capitalize on these sequence correlations by exploiting a transition bias: a tendency to repeat or alternate their previous response using an internal estimate of the sequence repeating probability. Surprisingly, this bias is null after error trials. The internal estimate however is not reset and it becomes ineffective again after the next correct response. This behavior is captured by a generative model, whereby a reward-driven modulatory signal gates the impact of the latent model of the environment on the current decision.

Mice learned a visual change detection task with a set of eight natural scene images. Subsequently, during 2-photon imaging experiments, mice performed the task with these familiar images and three sets of novel images. Strikingly, the temporal dynamics of VIP activity differed markedly between novel and familiar images: VIP cells were stimulus-driven by novel images but were suppressed by familiar stimuli and showed ramping activity when expected stimuli were omitted from a temporally predictable sequence. This prominent change in VIP activity suggests that these cells may adopt different modes of processing under novel versus familiar conditions.","Cortical circuits can flexibly change with experience and learning, but the effects on specific cell types, including distinct inhibitory types, are not well understood.

Strikingly, the temporal dynamics of VIP activity differed markedly between novel and familiar images: suppression of VIP activity caused familiar images to become driving stimuli, while novel stimuli were not affected and showed ramping activity when expected stimuli were omitted from a temporally predictable sequence. This prominent change in VIP activity suggests that these cells may adopt different modes of processing under novel versus familiar conditions.","Cortical circuits can flexibly change with experience and learning, but the effects on specific cell types, including distinct inhibitory types, are not well understood.

"Genome-wide association studies have generated an increasing number of common genetic variants associated with neurological and psychiatric disease risk. An improved understanding of the genetic control of gene expression in human brain is vital considering this is the likely modus operandum for many causal variants. However, human brain sampling complexities limit the explanatory power of brain-related expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and allele-specific expression (ASE) signals. We address this, using paired genomic and transcriptomic data from putamen and substantia nigra from 117 human brains, interrogating regulation at different RNA processing stages and uncovering novel transcripts. We identify disease-relevant regulatory loci, find that splicing eQTLs are enriched for regulatory information primarily controlled by vascular-related genes rather than neuron-specific genes, that ASEs provide cell-specific regulatory information with evidence for cellular specificity, and that incomplete annotation of the brain transcriptome limits interpretation of risk loci for neuropsychiatric disease.

"Oligophrenin-1 (Ophn1) encodes a Rho GTPase activating protein whose mutations cause X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) in humans. Loss of function of Ophn1 leads to impairments in the maturation and function of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, causing deficits in synaptic structure, function and plasticity. Epilepsy is a frequent comorbidity in patients with Ophn1-dependent XLID, but the cellular bases of hyperexcitability are poorly understood. Here we report that male mice knock-out (KO) for Ophn1 display hippocampal epileptiform alterations, which are associated with changes in parvalbumin-, somatostatin- and neuropeptide Y-positive interneurons. Because loss of function of Ophn1 is related to enhanced activity of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) and protein kinase A (PKA), we attempted to rescue Ophn1-dependent pathological phenotypes by treatment with the ROCK/PKA inhibitor fasudil. While acute administration of fasudil had no impact on seizure activity, seven weeks of treatment in adulthood were able to correct electrographic, neuroanatomical and synaptic alterations of Ophn1 deficient mice. These data demonstrate that hyperexcitability and the associated changes in GABAergic markers can be rescued at the adult stage in Ophn1-dependent XLID through ROCK/PKA inhibition.","Oligophrenin-1 (Ophn1) encodes a Rho GTPase activating protein whose mutations cause X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) in humans.

"Economic choices entail computing and comparing subjective values. Evidence from primates indicates that this behavior relies on the orbitofrontal cortex. Conversely, previous work in rodents provided conflicting results. Here we present a mouse model of economic choice behavior, and we show that the lateral orbital (LO) area is intimately related to the decision process. In the experiments, mice chose between different juices offered in variable amounts. Optogenetic inactivation of LO dramatically disrupted choices by inducing erratic changes of relative value and by increasing choice variability. Neuronal recordings revealed that different groups of cells encoded the values of individual options, the binary choice outcome and the chosen value. Choice patterns closely resembled those measured in primates. These groups do not match those previously identified in primates because the neuronal representation caused by spatial differences leads to choice variability. Our results lay the foundations for a circuit-level analysis of economic decisions.","Economic choices entail computing and comparing subjective values.

"Recent studies indicate that the precise timing and location of excitation and inhibition (E/I) within active dendritic trees can significantly impact neuronal function. How synaptic inputs are functionally organized at the subcellular level in intact circuits remains unclear. To address this issue, we took advantage of the retinal direction-selective ganglion cell circuit, where directionally tuned inhibition is known to shape non-directional excitatory signals. We combined two-photon calcium imaging with genetic, pharmacological, and single-cell ablation methods to examine the extent to which inhibition 'vetoes' excitation at the level of individual dendrites of direction-selective ganglion cells. We demonstrate that inhibition shapes direction selectivity independently within small dendritic segments (<10Âµm) with remarkable accuracy.

"Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have social interaction deficits and difficulty filtering information. Inhibitory interneurons filter information at pyramidal neurons of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), an integration hub for higher-order thalamic inputs important for social interaction. Humans with deletions including LMO4, an endogenous inhibitor of PTP1B, display intellectual disabilities and occasionally autism. PV-Lmo4KO mice ablate Lmo4 in PV interneurons and display ASD-like repetitive behaviors and social interaction deficits. Surprisingly, increased PV neuron-mediated peri-somatic feedforward inhibition to the pyramidal neurons causes a compensatory reduction in (somatostatin neuron-mediated) dendritic inhibition. These homeostatic changes increase filtering of cortico-cortical inputs but reduce filtering of mediodorsal-thalamocortical inputs and narrow the range of stimuli ACC pyramidal neurons can distinguish. Simultaneous ablation of PTP1B in PV-Lmo4KO neurons prevents these deficits, indicating that PTP1B activation in PV interneurons contributes to ASD-like characteristics and homeostatic maladaptation of inhibitory circuits may contribute to deficient information filtering in ASD.","Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have social interaction deficits and difficulty filtering information.

"Connections between neuronal populations may be genetically hardwired or random. In the insect olfactory system, projection neurons of the antennal lobe connect randomly to Kenyon cells of the mushroom body. Consequently, while the odor responses of the projection neurons are stereotyped across individuals, the responses of the Kenyon cells are variable. Surprisingly, downstream of Kenyon cells, mushroom body output neurons show stereotypy in their responses. We found that the stereotypy is enabled by the convergence of inputs from many Kenyon cells onto an output neuron, and does not require learning. The stereotypy emerges in the total response of the Kenyon cell population using multiple odor-specific features of the projection neuron responses, benefits from lateral inhibition in the neural circuitry, depends on the convergence:randomness ratio, and is constrained by sparseness.

"When selectively attending to a speech stream in multi-talker scenarios, low-frequency cortical activity is known to synchronize selectively to fluctuations in the attended speech signal. Older listeners with age-related sensorineural hearing loss (presbycusis) often struggle to understand speech in such situations, even when wearing a hearing aid. Yet, it is unclear whether a peripheral hearing loss degrades the attentional modulation of cortical speech tracking. Here, we used psychoacoustics and electroencephalography (EEG) in male and female human listeners to examine potential effects of hearing loss on EEG correlates of speech envelope synchronization in cortex. During EEG recordings, we used a selective attention task with two spatially separated simultaneous speech streams where NH and HI listeners both showed high speech recognition performance. Behaviorally, older hearing-impaired (HI) listeners showed degraded speech-in-noise recognition and reduced temporal acuity compared with age-matched normal-hearing (NH) controls. Low-frequency (<10 Hz) envelope-entrained EEG responses were enhanced in the HI listeners, both for the attended speech, but also for tone sequences modulated at slow rates (4 Hz) during passive listening. Interestingly, compared with the attended speech, responses to the ignored stream were found to be reduced in both HI and NH listeners, allowing for the ambient background noise to be classified from single-trial EEG data with similar high accuracy in the two groups. However, despite robust attention-modulated speech entrainment, the HI listeners rated the competing speech task to be more difficult. These results suggest that speech-in-noise problems experienced by older HI listeners are not necessarily associated with degraded attentional selection.","When selectively attending to a speech stream in multi-talker scenarios, low-frequency cortical activity is known to synchronize selectively to fluctuations in the attended speech signal.

"The lateral hypothalamus (LH) has long been implicated in maintaining behavioral homeostasis essential for the survival of an individual. However, recent evidence suggests its more widespread roles in behavioral coordination, extending to the social domain. The neuronal and circuit mechanisms behind the LH processing of social information are unknown. Here, we show that the LH represents distinct reward variables for ""self"" and ""other"" and is causally involved in shaping socially motivated behavior. During a Pavlovian conditioning procedure incorporating ubiquitous social experiences where rewards to others affect one's motivation, LH cells encoded the subjective value of self-rewards, as well as the likelihood of self- or other-rewards. The other-reward coding was not a general consequence of other's existence, but a specific effect of other's reward availability. Coherent activity with and top-down information flow from the medial prefrontal cortex, a hub of social brain networks, contributed to signal encoding in the LH. Furthermore, deactivation of LH cells was caused by the motivational impact of other-rewards. These results indicate that the LH constitutes a subcortical node in social brain networks and shapes one's motivation by integrating cortically derived, agent-specific reward information.","The lateral hypothalamus (LH) has long been implicated in maintaining behavioral homeostasis essential for the survival of an individual.

"Despite advances in methods to detect protein synthesis, it has not been possible to measure endogenous protein synthesis levels in vivo in an entire vertebrate brain. We developed a transgenic zebrafish line that allows for cell-type-specific labeling and imaging of nascent proteins in the entire animal. By replacing leucine with glycine in the zebrafish MetRS-binding pocket (MetRS-L270G), we enabled the cell-type-specific incorporation of the azide-bearing non-canonical-amino-acid azidonorleucine (ANL) during protein synthesis. Newly synthesized proteins were then labeled via 'click chemistry'. Using a Gal4-UAS-ELAV3 line to express MetRS-L270G in neurons, we measured protein synthesis intensities across the entire nervous system. We visualized endogenous protein synthesis and demonstrated that seizure-induced neural activity results in reduced translation levels in neurons. This method allows for robust analysis of endogenous protein synthesis in a cell-type-specific manner, in vivo at single-cell resolution.","Despite advances in methods to detect protein synthesis, it has not been possible to measure endogenous protein synthesis levels in vivo in an entire vertebrate brain.

"To efficiently navigate through the environment and avoid potential threats, an animal must quickly detect the motion of approaching objects. Current models of primate vision place the origins of this complex computation in the visual cortex. Here, we report that detection of approaching motion begins in the retina. Several ganglion cell types, the retinal output neurons, show selectivity to approaching motion. Synaptic current recordings from these cells further reveal that this preference for approaching motion arises in the interplay between presynaptic excitatory and inhibitory circuit elements. These findings demonstrate how excitatory and inhibitory circuits interact to mediate an ethologically relevant neural function.

Optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulation reveals that brief dmPFC-PVI activation triggers an active social approach to promote sociability. Juvenile social isolation decouples dmPFC-PVI activation from subsequent active social approach by freezing the functional maturation process of dmPFC-PVIs during the juvenile-to-adult transition. Chemogenetic activation of dmPFC-PVI activity in the adult animal mitigates juvenile isolation-induced social deficits. Therefore, social experience-dependent maturation of dmPFC-PVI is linked to long-term impacts on social behavior.","Social isolation during the juvenile critical window is detrimental to proper functioning of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and establishment of appropriate adult social behaviors.

Likewise, stiff substrates induce microglial bipolarization and diminish TGFÎ²1 expression in hydrogels.

"Sensory hair cell losses underlie the vast majority of permanent hearing and balance deficits in humans, but many nonmammalian vertebrates can fully recover from hearing impairments and balance dysfunctions because supporting cells (SCs) in their ears retain lifelong regenerative capacities that depend on proliferation and differentiation as replacement hair cells. Most SCs in vertebrate ears stop dividing during embryogenesis; and soon after birth, vestibular SCs in mammals transition to lasting quiescence as they develop massively thickened circumferential F-actin bands at their E-cadherin-rich adherens junctions. Here, we report that treatment with EGF and a GSK3 inhibitor thinned the circumferential F-actin bands throughout the sensory epithelium of cultured utricles that were isolated from adult mice of either sex. That treatment also caused decreases in E-cadherin, Î²-catenin, and YAP in the striola, and stimulated robust proliferation of mature, normally quiescent striolar SCs. The findings suggest that the composition of Î²-catenin in the junctions, which is not present in the SCs of fish, amphibians, and birds which readily regenerate hair cells, is responsible in part for the mammalian ear's vulnerability to permanent balance and hearing deficits.","Sensory hair cell losses underlie the vast majority of permanent hearing and balance deficits in humans, but many nonmammalian vertebrates can fully recover from hearing impairments and balance dysfunctions because supporting cells (SCs) in their ears retain lifelong regenerative capacities that depend on proliferation and differentiation as replacement hair cells.

Further, we identify a subpopulation of neurons with this response property that are synchronized with the hippocampal theta oscillation.

"Could nose-to-brain pathways mediate the effects of peptides such as oxytocin (OT) on brain physiology when delivered intranasally? We address this question by contrasting two methods of intranasal administration (a standard nasal spray, and a nebulizer expected to improve OT deposition in nasal areas putatively involved in direct nose-to-brain transport) to intravenous administration in terms of effects on regional cerebral blood flow during two hours post-dosing. We demonstrate that OT-induced decreases in amygdala perfusion, a key hub of the OT central circuitry, are explained entirely by regional cerebral changes leading to increases in systemic circulation following both intranasal and intravenous OT administration. Yet we also provide robust evidence confirming the validity of the intranasal route to target specific brain regions.

"von Economo neurons (VENs) are bipolar, spindle-shaped neurons restricted to layer 5 of human frontoinsula and anterior cingulate cortex that appear to be selectively vulnerable to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, although little is known about other VEN cellular phenotypes. Single nucleus RNA-sequencing of frontoinsula layer 5 identifies a transcriptomically-defined cell cluster that contained VENs, but also fork cells and a subset of pyramidal neurons. Cross-species alignment of this cell cluster with a well-annotated mouse classification shows strong homology to extratelencephalic (ET) excitatory neurons that project to subcerebral targets. Additionally, we describe the first patch clamp recordings of VENs from neurosurgically-resected tissue that show distinctive intrinsic membrane properties relative to neighboring pyramidal neurons.

"Regulation of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) expression is central to synaptic plasticity and brain function, but how these changes occur in vivo remains elusive. Here, we developed a method to longitudinally monitor the expression of synaptic AMPARs across multiple cortical layers in awake mice using two-photon imaging. We observed that baseline AMPAR expression in individual spines is highly dynamic with more dynamics in primary visual cortex (V1) layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons than V1 L5 neurons. Visual deprivation through binocular enucleation induces a synapse-specific and depth-dependent change of synaptic AMPARs in V1 L2/3 neurons, wherein deep synapses are potentiated less than superficial synapses. The increase is specific to L2/3 neurons and absent on apical dendrites of L5 neurons, and is dependent on expression of the AMPAR-binding protein GRIP1. Our study demonstrates that specific neuronal connections, across cortical layers and even within individual neurons, respond uniquely to changes in sensory experience.","Regulation of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) expression is central to synaptic plasticity and brain function, but how these changes occur in vivo remains elusive.

"Although mTOR signaling is known as a broad regulator of cell growth and proliferation, in neurons it regulates synaptic transmission, which is thought to be a major mechanism through which altered mTOR signaling leads to neurological disease. Although previous studies have delineated postsynaptic roles for mTOR, whether it regulates presynaptic function is largely unknown. Moreover, the mTOR kinase operates in two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, suggesting that mTOR's role in synaptic transmission may be complex-specific. To better understand their roles in synaptic transmission, we genetically inactivated mTORC1 or mTORC2 in cultured mouse glutamatergic hippocampal neurons. Inactivation of either complex reduced neuron growth and evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs), however, the effects of mTORC1 on eEPSCs were postsynaptic and the effects of mTORC2 were presynaptic. Despite presynaptic inhibition of evoked release, mTORC1 inactivation enhanced spontaneous vesicle fusion and replenishment, suggesting that presynaptic release acts to modulate mTORC1 after its inactivation to optimize glutamatergic synaptic transmission.","Although mTOR signaling is known as a broad regulator of cell growth and proliferation, in neurons it regulates synaptic transmission, which is thought to be a major mechanism through which altered mTOR signaling leads to neurological disease.

"Recent studies show that GPCRs rapidly interconvert between multiple states although our ability to interrogate, monitor and visualize them is limited by a relative lack of suitable tools. We previously reported two nanobodies (Nb39 and Nb6) that stabilize distinct ligand- and efficacy-delimited conformations of the kappa opioid receptor. Here, we demonstrate via X-ray crystallography a nanobody-targeted allosteric binding site by which Nb6 stabilizes a ligand-dependent inactive state. As Nb39 stabilizes an active-like state, we show how these two state-dependent nanobodies can provide real-time reporting of ligand stabilized states in cells in situ. Significantly, we demonstrate that chimeric GPCRs can be created with engineered nanobody binding sites to report ligand-stabilized states. Our results provide both insights regarding potential mechanisms for allosterically modulating KOR with nanobodies but fail as a tool for reporting the real-time, in situ dynamic range of GPCR activity.","Recent studies show that GPCRs rapidly interconvert between multiple states although our ability to interrogate, monitor and visualize them is limited by a relative lack of suitable tools.

"The ability to handle approximate quantities, or number sense, has been recurrently linked to mathematical skills, although the nature of the mechanism allowing to extract numerical information (i.e., numerosity) from environmental stimuli is still debated. A set of objects is indeed not only characterized by its numerosity but also by other features, such as the summed area occupied by the elements, which often covary with numerosity. These intrinsic relations between numerosity and nonnumerical magnitudes led some authors to argue that numerosity is not independently processed but extracted through a weighting of continuous magnitudes. This view cannot be properly tested through classic behavioral and neuroimaging approaches due to these intrinsic correlations. The current study used a frequency-tagging EEG approach to separately measure responses to numerosity as well as to continuous magnitudes. We recorded occipital responses to numerosity, total area, and convex hull changes but not to density and dot size. We additionally applied a model predicting primary visual cortex responses to the set of stimuli. The model output was closely aligned with our electrophysiological data, since it predicted discrimination only for numerosity, total area, and convex hull. Our findings thus demonstrate that numerosity can be independently processed at an early stage in the visual cortex, even when completely isolated from other magnitude changes. The similar implicit discrimination for numerosity as for some continuous magnitudes, which correspond to basic visual percepts, shows that both can be extracted independently, hence substantiating the nature of numerosity as a primary feature of the visual scene.","The ability to handle approximate quantities, or number sense, has been recurrently linked to mathematical skills, although the nature of the mechanism allowing to extract numerical information (i.e., numerosity) from environmental stimuli is still debated.

"Auditory speech perception enables listeners to access phonological categories from speech sounds. During speech production and speech motor learning, speakers' experience matched auditory and somatosensory input. Accordingly, access to phonetic units might also be provided by somatosensory information. The present study assessed whether humans can identify vowels using somatosensory feedback, without auditory feedback. A tongue-positioning task was used in which participants were required to achieve different tongue postures within the /e, Îµ, a/ articulatory range, in a procedure that was totally nonspeech like, involving distorted visual feedback of tongue shape. Tongue postures were measured using electromagnetic articulography. At the end of each tongue-positioning trial, subjects were required to whisper the corresponding vocal tract configuration with masked auditory feedback and to identify the vowel associated with the reached tongue posture. Masked auditory feedback ensured that vowel categorization was based on somatosensory feedback rather than auditory feedback. A separate group of subjects was required to auditorily classify the whispered sounds. In addition, we modeled the link between vowel categories and tongue postures in normal speech production with a Bayesian classifier based on the tongue postures recorded from the same speakers for several repetitions of the /e, Îµ, a/ vowels during a separate speech production task. Overall, our results demonstrate that somatosensory feedback is enhanced by vowel categorization itself, rather than enabling the categorization, with accuracy comparable to that of auditory perception of whispered sounds, and in congruence with normal speech articulation, as accounted for by the Bayesian classifier.","Auditory speech perception enables listeners to access phonological categories from speech sounds.

We address this by integrating functional MRI and measurements of endogenous oxytocin in participants who view an ingroup and an outgroup member's suffering that is caused mutually (Revenge group) or by a computer (Control group). We show that intergroup conflict encountered by the Revenge group is associated with an increased level of oxytocin in saliva compared to that in the Control group. Furthermore, the medial prefrontal activity in response to ingroup pain in the Revenge group but not in the Control group mediates the association between endogenous oxytocin and the propensity to give painful electric shocks to outgroup members, regardless of whether they were directly involved in the conflict. Our findings highlight an important neurobiological correlate of revenge propensity, which may be implicated in conflict contagion across individuals in the context of intergroup conflict.","Revenge during intergroup conflict is a human universal, but its neurobiological underpinnings remain unclear.

"Sports are replete with strategies, yet coaching lore often emphasizes 'quieting the mind', 'trusting the body' and 'avoiding overthinking' in referring to the importance of relying less on high-level explicit strategies in favor of low-level implicit motor learning. We investigated the interactions between explicit strategy and implicit motor adaptation by designing a sensorimotor learning paradigm that drives adaptive changes in some dimensions but not others. We find that strategy and implicit adaptation synergize in undriven dimensions, but effectively cancel each other in driven dimensions. Independent analyses-based on time lags, the correlational structure in the data and computational modeling-demonstrate that this cancellation occurs because implicit adaptation effectively compensates for noise in explicit strategy rather than the converse, acting to clean up the motor noise resulting from low-fidelity explicit strategy during motor learning. These results provide new insight into why implicit learning increasingly takes over from explicit strategy as skill learning proceeds.","Sports are replete with strategies, yet coaching lore often emphasizes 'quieting the mind', 'trusting the body' and 'avoiding overthinking' in referring to the importance of relying less on high-level explicit strategies in favor of low-level implicit motor learning.

We find that strategy and implicit adaptation synergize in driven dimensions, but effectively cancel each other in undriven dimensions. Independent analyses-based on time lags, the correlational structure in the data and computational modeling-demonstrate that implicit adaptation compensates for explicit strategy rather than explicit strategy compensating for implicit adaptation, acting to clean up the motor noise resulting from low-fidelity explicit strategy during motor learning.

"Genes play a strong role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), with late-onset AD showing heritability of 58-79% and early-onset AD showing over 90%. Genetic association provides a robust platform to build our understanding of the etiology of this complex disease. Over 50 loci are now implicated for AD, suggesting that AD is a disease of multiple components, as supported by pathway analyses (immunity, endocytosis, cholesterol transport, ubiquitination, amyloid-Î² and tau processing). Over 50% of late-onset AD heritability has been captured, allowing researchers to calculate the accumulation of AD genetic risk through polygenic risk scores. A polygenic risk score predicts disease with up to 90% accuracy and is an exciting tool in our research armory that could allow selection of those with high polygenic risk scores for clinical trials and precision medicine. It could also allow cellular modelling of the combined risk. Here we propose the multiplex model as a new perspective from which to understand AD. The multiplex model reflects the combination of some, or all, of these model components (genetic and environmental), in a tissue-specific manner, to trigger or sustain environmental changes, which ultimately results in the cell and synaptic loss observed in AD.","Genes play a strong role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), with late-onset AD showing heritability of 58-79% and early-onset AD showing over 90%.

"Tissue repair after spinal cord injury requires the mobilization of immune and glial cells to form a protective barrier that seals the wound and facilitates debris clearing, inflammatory containment and matrix compaction. This process involves corralling, wherein phagocytic immune cells become confined to the necrotic core, which is surrounded by an astrocytic border. Here we elucidate a temporally distinct gene signature in injury-activated microglia and macrophages (IAMs) that engages axon guidance pathways. Plexin-B2 is upregulated in IAMs and is required for motor sensory recovery after spinal cord injury. Plexin-B2 deletion in myeloid cells impairs corralling, leading to diffuse tissue damage, inflammatory spillover and hampered axon regeneration. Corralling begins early and requires Plexin-B2 in both microglia and macrophages. Mechanistically, Plexin-B2 promotes microglia motility, steers IAMs away from colliding cells and facilitates matrix compaction. Our data therefore establish Plexin-B2 as an important link that integrates biochemical cues and physical interactions of IAMs with the injury microenvironment during wound healing.","Tissue repair after spinal cord injury requires the mobilization of immune and glial cells to form a protective barrier that seals the wound and facilitates debris clearing, inflammatory containment and matrix compaction.

"The roots of psychopathology frequently take shape during infancy in the context of parent-infant interactions and adversity. Yet, neurobiological mechanisms linking these processes during infancy remain elusive. Here, using responses to attachment figures among infants who experienced adversity as a benchmark, we assessed rat pup cortical local field potentials (LFPs) and behaviors exposed to adversity in response to maternal rough and nurturing handling by examining its impact on pup separation-reunion with the mother. We show that during adversity, pup cortical LFP dynamic range decreased during nurturing maternal behaviors, but was minimally impacted by rough handling. During reunion, adversity-experiencing pups showed aberrant interactions with mother and blunted cortical LFP. Blocking pup stress hormone during either adversity or reunion restored typical behavior, LFP power, and cross-frequency coupling. This translational approach suggests adversity-rearing produces a stress-induced aberrant neurobehavioral processing of the mother, which can be used as an early biomarker of later-life pathology.","The roots of psychopathology frequently take shape during infancy in the context of parent-infant interactions and adversity.

"Is vision necessary for the development of the categorical organization of the Ventral Occipito-Temporal Cortex (VOTC)? We used fMRI to characterize VOTC responses to eight categories presented acoustically in sighted and early blind individuals, and visually in a separate sighted group. We observed that VOTC reliably encodes sound categories in sighted and blind people using a representational structure and connectivity partially similar to the one found in vision. Sound categories were, however, more reliably encoded in the sighted than the blind group, using a representational format closer to the one found in vision. Crucially, VOTC in blind represents the categorical membership of sounds rather than their acoustic features. Our results suggest that sounds trigger categorical responses in the VOTC of congenitally blind and sighted people that partially match the topography and functional profile of the visual response, despite qualitative nuances in the categorical organization of VOTC between modalities and groups.","Is vision necessary for the development of the categorical organization of the Ventral Occipito-Temporal Cortex (VOTC)?

"We investigated the synaptic innervation of apical dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells in a region between layers (L) 1 and 2 using 3-D electron microscopy applied to four cortical regions in mouse. We found the relative inhibitory input at the apical dendrite's main bifurcation to be more than 2-fold larger for L2 than L3 and L5 thick-tufted pyramidal cells. Towards the distal tuft dendrites in upper L1, the relative inhibitory input was at least about 2-fold larger for L5 pyramidal cells than for all others. Only L3 pyramidal cells showed homogeneous inhibitory input fraction. The inhibitory-to-excitatory synaptic ratio is thus specific for the types of pyramidal cells. Inhibitory axons lead to the preferential innervation of L3/5 apical dendrites which, in turn, causes changes in the L2 dendrites rather than the other way around.

"During spatial navigation, animals use self-motion to estimate positions through path integration. However, estimation errors accumulate over time and it is unclear how they are corrected. Here we report a new cell class ('cue cell') encoding visual cues that could be used to correct errors in path integration in mouse medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). During virtual navigation, individual cue cells exhibited firing fields only near visual cues and their population response formed sequences repeated at each cue. These cells consistently responded to cues across multiple environments. On a track with cues on left and right sides, most cue cells only responded to cues on one side. During navigation in a real arena, they showed spatially stable activity and accounted for 32% of unidentified, spatially stable MEC cells. These cue cell properties demonstrate that the presence of auditory cues, rather than visual cues, in the MEC is crucial for constructing a code representing spatial landmarks important for error correction during path integration.","During spatial navigation, animals use self-motion to estimate positions through path integration.

"Responses of sensory neurons are often modeled using a weighted combination of rectified linear subunits. Since these subunits often cannot be measured directly, a flexible method is needed to infer their properties from the responses of downstream neurons. We present a method for maximum likelihood estimation of subunits by soft-clustering spike-triggered stimuli, and demonstrate its effectiveness in visual neurons. For parasol retinal ganglion cells in macaque retina, estimated subunits partitioned the receptive field into compact regions, likely representing aggregated bipolar cell inputs. Joint clustering revealed shared subunits between neighboring cells, producing a parsimonious population model. Closed-loop validation, using stimuli lying in the null space of the linear receptive field, revealed stronger nonlinearities in OFF cells than ON cells. Interestingly, it was determined that thermal noise, rather than synaptic input variation, was responsible for the accurate prediction of responses to natural images, jittered to emulate fixational eye movements.

"Experiencing events as controllable is essential for human well-being. Based on classic psychological theory, we test how internal control beliefs impact the affective valuation of task outcomes, neural dynamics and ensuing behavioral preferences. In three consecutive studies we show that dynamics in positive affect increase, with a qualitative shift towards self-evaluative pride, when agents believe they caused a given outcome. We demonstrate that these outcomes engage brain networks processing self-referential information in the cortical midline. Here, activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex tracks outcome valence regarding both success as well as internal control, and covaries with positive affect in response to outcomes. These affective dynamics also relate to increased functional coupling between the ventral striatum and cortical midline structures. Finally, we show that preferences for control predict pride, even at monetary costs. Our investigations extend recent models of positive affect and well-being, and emphasize that control beliefs drive intrinsic motivation.","Experiencing events as controllable is essential for human well-being.

"Visuomotor impairments characterize numerous neurological disorders and neurogenetic syndromes, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Dravet, Fragile X, Prader-Willi, Turner, and Williams syndromes. Despite recent advances in systems neuroscience, the biological basis underlying visuomotor functional impairments associated with these clinical conditions is poorly understood. In this study, we used neuroimaging connectomic approaches to map the visuomotor integration (VMI) system in the human brain and investigated the topology approximation of the VMI network to the Allen Human Brain Atlas, a whole-brain transcriptome-wide atlas of cortical genetic expression. We found the genetic expression of four genes-TBR1, SCN1A, MAGEL2, and CACNB4-to be prominently associated with visuomotor integrators in the human cortex. Surprisingly, the expression of the aromatase gene, typically involved in hormonal conversion, was misleadingly attributed to the development of visuomotor network organization, overshadowing the genes previously thought to be responsible. Our findings delineate gene expression traits underlying the VMI system in the human cortex, where specific genes, such as TBR1, are likely to play a central role in its neuronal organization, as well as on specific phenotypes of neurogenetic syndromes.","Visuomotor impairments characterize numerous neurological disorders and neurogenetic syndromes, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Dravet, Fragile X, Prader-Willi, Turner, and Williams syndromes.

In this study, we used neuroimaging connectomic approaches to map the visuomotor integration (VMI) system in the human brain and investigated the topology approximation of the VMI network to the Allen Human Brain Atlas, a whole-brain transcriptome-wide atlas of cortical genetic expression. We found the genetic expression of four genes-TBR1, SCN1A, MAGEL2, and CACNB4-to be prominently associated with visuomotor integrators in the human cortex.

"Lateral posterior nucleus (LP) of thalamus, the rodent homologue of primate pulvinar, projects extensively to sensory cortices. However, its functional role in sensory cortical processing remains largely unclear. Here, bidirectional activity modulations of LP or its projection to the primary auditory cortex (A1) in awake mice reveal that LP improves auditory processing in A1 supragranular-layer neurons by sharpening their receptive fields and frequency tuning, as well as increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This is achieved through a subtractive-suppression mechanism, mediated largely by LP-to-A1 axons preferentially innervating specific inhibitory neurons in layer 1 and superficial layers. LP is strongly activated by specific sensory signals relayed from the superior colliculus (SC), reducing the maintenance and enhancement of A1 processing in the presence of auditory background noise and threatening visual looming stimuli respectively. Thus, a multisensory bottom-up SC-pulvinar-A1 pathway plays a role in contextual and cross-modality modulation of auditory cortical processing.","Lateral posterior nucleus (LP) of thalamus, the rodent homologue of primate pulvinar, projects extensively to sensory cortices.

"Synaptic adhesion molecules regulate synapse development and function. However, whether and how presynaptic adhesion molecules regulate postsynaptic NMDAR function remains largely unclear. Presynaptic LAR family receptor tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs) regulate synapse development through mechanisms that include trans-synaptic adhesion; however, whether they regulate postsynaptic receptor functions remains unknown. Here we report that presynaptic PTPÏ, a LAR-RPTP, enhances postsynaptic NMDA receptor (NMDAR) currents and NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. This regulation does not involve trans-synaptic adhesions of PTPÏ, suggesting that the cytoplasmic domains of PTPÏ, known to have tyrosine phosphatase activity and mediate protein-protein interactions, are important. In line with this, phosphotyrosine levels of presynaptic proteins, including neurexin-1, are strongly increased in PTPÏ-mutant mice. Behaviorally, PTPÏ-dependent NMDAR regulation is important for social and reward-related novelty recognition.

"Pupillometry, a noninvasive measure of arousal, complements human functional MRI (fMRI) to detect periods of variable cognitive processing and identify networks that relate to particular attentional states. Even under anesthesia, pupil dynamics correlate with brain-state fluctuations, and extended dilations mark the transition to more arousable states. However, cross-scale neuronal activation patterns are seldom linked to brain state-dependent pupil dynamics. Here, we complemented resting-state fMRI in rats with cortical calcium recording (GCaMP-mediated) and pupillometry to tackle the linkage between brain-state changes and neural dynamics across different scales. This multimodal platform allowed us to identify a global brain network that covaried with pupil size, which served to generate an index indicative of the brain-state fluctuation during anesthesia. Besides, a specific correlation pattern was detected in the brainstem, at a location consistent with noradrenergic cell group 5 (A5), which appeared to be dependent on the coupling between different frequencies of cortical activity, suggesting that brain-state dynamics influence noradrenergic cell interactions rather than vice versa. The multimodal fMRI combining concurrent calcium recordings and pupillometry enables tracking brain state-dependent pupil dynamics and identifying unique cross-scale neuronal dynamic patterns under anesthesia.","Pupillometry, a noninvasive measure of arousal, complements human functional MRI (fMRI) to detect periods of variable cognitive processing and identify networks that relate to particular attentional states.

"Whether transient or sustained neuronal activity during the delay period underlies working memory (WM) has been debated. Here, we report that transient, but not sustained, delay-period activity in mouse anterior agranular insular cortex (aAIC) plays a dominant role in maintaining WM information during learning of novel olfactory tasks. By optogenetic screening over 12 brain regions, we found that suppressing aAIC activity markedly impaired olfactory WM maintenance during learning. Single-unit recording showed that odor-selective aAIC neurons with predominantly transient firing patterns encoded WM information. Both WM task performance and transient-neuron proportion were enhanced and reduced by activating and suppressing the delay-period activity of the projection from medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to aAIC. The ability of mice to resist delay-period distractors suggests that increased resistance to distractors does not result from transient neuronal activity. Therefore, transient, but not sustained, aAIC neuronal activity during the delay period is largely responsible for maintaining information while learning novel WM tasks.","Whether transient or sustained neuronal activity during the delay period underlies working memory (WM) has been debated.

In more than 100 context trials, participants were exposed either to an intra-saccadic or to a post-saccadic disturbance or to no disturbance at all. After induction of a specific context, I measured peri-saccadic suppression. Displacement discrimination thresholds of observers were high after participants were exposed to an intra-saccadic disturbance. Exposure to a context without any intra-saccadic stimulation might explain why displacement discrimination improved, allowing observers to see shifts as during fixation. Saccade-contingent habituation suggests that post-saccadic disturbance does not contribute to the non-perception of trans-saccadic retinal stimulation.","Although our eyes are in constant movement, we remain unaware of the high-speed stimulation produced by the retinal displacement.

"Previous research has focused on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as a key brain region in the mitigation of the competition that arises from two simultaneously active signals. However, to date, no study has demonstrated that ACC is necessary for this form of behavioral flexibility, nor have any studies shown that ACC acts by modulating downstream brain regions such as the dorsal medial striatum (DMS) that encode action plans necessary for task completion. Here, we performed unilateral excitotoxic lesions of ACC while recording downstream from the ipsilateral hemisphere of DMS in rats, performing a variant of the STOP-signal task. We show that on STOP trials lesioned rats perform worse, in part due to the failure of timely directional action plans to emerge in the DMS, as well as the overrepresentation of the to-be-inhibited behavior. Collectively, our findings suggest that ACC is necessary for the mitigation of competing inputs and validates many of the existing theoretical predictions for the role of ACC in cognitive control.","Previous research has focused on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as a key brain region in the mitigation of the competition that arises from two simultaneously active signals.

"Mechanistic studies in rodents evidenced synaptic remodeling in neuronal circuits that control food intake. However, the physiological relevance of this process is not well defined. Here, we show that the firing activity of anorexigenic POMC neurons located in the hypothalamus is increased after a standard meal. Postprandial hyperactivity of POMC neurons relies on synaptic plasticity that engages pre-synaptic mechanisms, which does not involve structural remodeling of synapses but retraction of glial coverage. These functional and morphological neuroglial changes are triggered by postprandial hyperglycemia. Chemogenetically induced glial retraction on POMC neurons is sufficient to increase POMC activity and modify meal patterns. These findings indicate that synaptic plasticity within the melanocortin system happens at the timescale of meals and likely contributes to short-term control of food intake. Interestingly, these effects are lost with a high-fat meal, suggesting that neuroglial plasticity of POMC neurons is involved in the satietogenic properties of foods.","Mechanistic studies in rodents evidenced synaptic remodeling in neuronal circuits that control food intake.

"The striatum is a critical forebrain structure integrating cognitive, sensory, and motor information from diverse brain regions into meaningful behavioral output. However, the transcriptional mechanisms underlying striatal development at single-cell resolution remain unknown. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we examine the cellular diversity of the early postnatal striatum and show that Foxp1, a transcription factor strongly linked to autism and intellectual disability, regulates the cellular composition, neurochemical architecture, and connectivity of the striatum in a cell-type-dependent fashion. We also identify Foxp1-regulated target genes within distinct cell types and connect these molecular changes to functional and behavioral deficits relevant to phenotypes described in patients with FOXP1 loss-of-function mutations. Using this approach, we could also examine the non-cell-autonomous effects produced by disrupting one cell type and the molecular compensation that occurs in other populations. These data reveal the cell-type-specific transcriptional mechanisms regulated by Foxp1 that do not underlie distinct features of striatal circuitry.","The striatum is a critical forebrain structure integrating cognitive, sensory, and motor information from diverse brain regions into meaningful behavioral output.

"The functional impact of single interneurons on neuronal output in vivo and how interneurons are recruited by physiological activity patterns remain poorly understood. In the cerebellar cortex, molecular layer interneurons and their targets, Purkinje cells, receive excitatory inputs from granule cells and climbing fibers. Using dual patch-clamp recordings from interneurons and Purkinje cells in vivo, we probe the spatiotemporal interactions between these circuit elements. We show that single interneuron spikes can potently inhibit Purkinje cell output, depending on interneuron location. Climbing fiber input activates many interneurons via electrical synapses rather than glutamate spillover, but results in inhibition of those interneurons that inhibit the same Purkinje cell receiving the climbing fiber input, forming a disinhibitory motif. These interneuron circuits are engaged during sensory processing, creating diverse pathway-specific response functions. These findings demonstrate how the powerful effect of single interneurons on Purkinje cell output can be sculpted by various interneuron circuit motifs to diversify cerebellar computations.","The functional impact of single interneurons on neuronal output inÂ vivo and how interneurons are recruited by physiological activity patterns remain poorly understood.
