You will be provided with an abstract of a research paper from the field of {{subject}}. Your task is to **extract the origin sentences for background** and **make conclusion in less than 3 sentences** about the abstract's research method and results to identify and return the following three components:

1) **Background** – The part of the abstract that explains the context or motivation for the research. Be sure to capture all context-related sentences without omissions.

2) **Method** – The part of the abstract describing the research methods, techniques, or approaches used in the study. Ensure this includes all relevant methods and approaches described in the abstract.

3) **Result** – The part of the abstract summarizing the findings or conclusions of the study. Extract every result-oriented sentence without leaving out any part of the findings or conclusions.

**You answer should be a json dict, which strictly follow the following format:**
{
    "Background": "those exact background sentences from the abstract",
    "Method": "your conclusion of the method used in this paper",
    "Result": "your conclusion of the result presented by this paper"
}

The abstract you need to process is as follows:
