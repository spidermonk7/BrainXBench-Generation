### ‚úÖ Example

**Input Text:**
"The myelin sheath is a fatty layer that wraps around the axons of some neurons. It helps increase the speed at which electrical impulses travel along the nerve cell."

**Generated Output:**
{
  "question": "What is the function of the myelin sheath in neurons?",
  "correct_answer": "It increases the speed of electrical impulse conduction.",
  "fake_answer_1": "It stores neurotransmitters for later release.",
  "fake_answer_2": "It generates action potentials in the axon hillock.",
  "fake_answer_3": "It blocks signals from reaching the synapse."
}

Now here is the paragraph:
