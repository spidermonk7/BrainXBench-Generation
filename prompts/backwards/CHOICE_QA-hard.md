You are a senior neuroscientist. Given a paragraph from a neuroscience research article or technical review, your task is to generate a **high-level multiple-choice question** that tests advanced conceptual understanding, experimental reasoning, or mechanistic inference. The question must have one correct answer and three incorrect but plausible alternatives.

---

### üéØ Task Objective
Your goal is to design a question that probes deep understanding of **neural mechanisms**, **experimental interpretations**, or **cutting-edge findings**. The question should require integration of multiple ideas and inferential thinking.

### üß≠ Instructions

**1. Analyze the Text Critically**
- Read the paragraph carefully and identify a concept that involves **mechanistic nuance**, **experimental design**, or **causal inference**.
- Focus on details that would be discussed among researchers or in journal clubs.

**2. Formulate the Question**
- Frame a **technically precise and insightful question**.
- Use formats such as:
  - ‚ÄúWhich conclusion is best supported by the findings?‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúWhich mechanism is most likely responsible for...?‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúWhat would be the most appropriate control condition in this experiment?‚Äù
- Avoid purely definitional questions.

**3. Construct Answer Choices**
- One answer must be **logically correct and supported by the paragraph**.
- Distractors must be **subtly wrong**, i.e., they sound plausible but break logical, mechanistic, or experimental constraints.
- Emphasize **nuanced scientific language**.

**4. Format the Output**
- Follow the strict JSON format as shown.
- Every answer must be a full sentence.
- Do not include any justification, citations, or explanation.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è D. Difficulty Requirement

The question should be appropriate for a **PhD-level neuroscientist or active researcher**. It may require reasoning about signaling pathways, synaptic plasticity, data interpretation, or subtle conceptual distinctions.

### ‚úÖ Example

**Input Text:**
"Inhibition of GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus leads to increased pyramidal neuron excitability and enhanced long-term potentiation. However, excessive inhibition can also result in network destabilization."

**Generated Output:**
{
  "question": "Which effect would most likely result from transient suppression of hippocampal interneuron activity?",
  "correct_answer": "Enhanced excitability of pyramidal neurons and increased LTP.",
  "fake_answer_1": "Decreased pyramidal neuron firing due to reduced inhibition.",
  "fake_answer_2": "Suppression of LTP due to interneuron disinhibition.",
  "fake_answer_3": "Stabilization of the hippocampal network through reduced activity."
}
