Electrical synapses introduce significant delays due to ionic diffusion.,"Electrical synapses lack intrinsic synaptic delays, transmitting signals instantaneously.",text 2
The concentration of neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin modulates neuronal responses globally.,Neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin only affect single synapses locally without global modulations.,text 1
Chemical synapses facilitate point-to-point communication between neurons using neurotransmitter release.,Chemical synapses serve to only passively spread electrical potential without any neurotransmitter involvement.,text 1
