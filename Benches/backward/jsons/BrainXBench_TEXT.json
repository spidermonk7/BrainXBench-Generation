crayfish.","Chapter":190,"Book":"PrincipleNeuralScience","Version":1.0},{"Question":"What is the principal function of the basal ganglia in vertebrates?","Answer":"The main function of the basal ganglia is to select one behavior from several competing options, essential for motivational, affective, cognitive, and sensorimotor processing.","Chapter":191,"Book":"PrincipleNeuralScience","Version":1.0},{"Question":"What intrinsic mechanisms within the basal ganglia support its selection function?","Answer":"Intrinsic mechanisms, including phasic dopamine signaling, mediate reinforcement and promote the selection of behaviors within the basal ganglia.","Chapter":191,"Book":"PrincipleNeuralScience","Version":1.0},{"Question":"What disorders are associated with malfunctioning selection mechanisms in the basal ganglia?","Answer":"Parkinson\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, schizophrenia, ADHD, Tourette syndrome, OCD, and addictions are associated with basal ganglia dysfunctions, primarily involving disorders of selection or reinforcement.","Chapter":191,"Book":"PrincipleNeuralScience","Version":1.0},{"Question":"What are the principal input nuclei of the basal ganglia?","Answer":"The three primary input nuclei are the striatum, subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra pars compacta\/ventral tegmental area.","Chapter":191,"Book":"PrincipleNeuralScience","Version":1.0},{"Question":"What are the two primary output nuclei of the basal ganglia?","Answer":"The two main output nuclei are the substantia nigra pars reticulata and the internal globus pallidus.","Chapter":191,"Book":"PrincipleNeuralScience","Version":1.0},{"Question":"How are the basal ganglia organized to process inputs from different brain regions?","Answer":"Inputs to the basal ganglia are organized into functional territories classified as limbic, associative, and sensorimotor, which maintain topographical separation throughout basal ganglia circuitry.","Chapter":191,"Book":"PrincipleNeuralScience","Version":1.0},{"Question":"What distinguishes the direct and indirect pathways in the basal ganglia?","Answer":"The direct pathway involves inhibitory connections promoting behavior, while the indirect pathway includes excitatory relays suppressing behavior via intermediate structures like the external globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus.","Chapter":191,"Book":"PrincipleNeuralScience","Version":1.0},{"Question":"What neurotransmitter systems are involved in basal ganglia function?","Answer":"The basal ganglia use GABA, glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine for various processes, including inhibitory and excitatory signaling as well as modulatory effects.","Chapter":191,"Book":"PrincipleNeuralScience","Version":1.0},{"Question":"How does the basal ganglia network execute behavioral selection through its output nuclei?","Answer":"Behavioral selection occurs via disinhibition, where focused input suppresses tonic inhibitory output, allowing targeted brain regions (e.g., thalamus, brain stem) to influence behavior.","Chapter":191,"Book":"PrincipleNeuralScience","Version":1.0},{"Question":"What evidence supports the evolutionary conservation of the basal ganglia across vertebrate species?","Answer":"The basal ganglia exhibit a high degree of conservation in structure, neuronal components, neurotransmitters, and circuit organization over 500 million years, as seen in phylogenetically ancient vertebrates like lampreys.","Chapter":191,"Book":"PrincipleNeuralScience","Version":1.0},{"Question":"What is the main role of the axons of pyramidal cells in the visual cortex?","Answer":"The axons of pyramidal cells extend parallel to the cortical surface, enabling neurons to integrate information over large parts of the visual field by forming connections with other pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons.","Chapter":192,"Book":"PrincipleNeuralScience","Version":1.0},{"Question":"What is the primary characteristic of horizontal connections in the visual cortex?","Answer":"Horizontal connections link columns of cells with similar orientation specificity in the visual cortex.","Chapter":192,"Book":"PrincipleNeuralScience","Version":1.0},{"Question":"How is the pattern of horizontal connections visualized in the visual cortex?","Answer":"The pattern of horizontal connections is visualized by injecting an adenoviral vector containing the gene encoding green fluorescent protein into one orientation column and superimposing the image on an optically imaged map of the orientation columns.","Chapter":192,"Book":"PrincipleNeuralScience","Version":1.0},{"Question":"What is a bell-shaped tuning curve in neural responses?","Answer":"A bell-shaped tuning curve describes how a neuron\u2019s response peaks at a particular stimulus value and gradually decreases on either side of that value, indicating the range of stimulus the neuron is tuned to.","Chapter":192,"Book":"PrincipleNeuralScience","Version":1.0},{"Question":"How is a visual stimulus's wavelength determined in a neural context?","Answer":"A visual stimulus's wavelength is determined using the weighted average of convergent signals from multiple neurons whose tuning curves overlap the stimulus's range of wavelengths.","Chapter":192,"Book":"PrincipleNeuralScience","Version":1.0},{"Question":"What is population coding and how does it work in the context of orientation-selective cells?","Answer":"Population coding represents visual stimuli using the combined activity of multiple neurons. In orientation-selective cells, neurons with different orientation preferences respond to stimuli and their responses are combined into a vector sum representing the overall perceived orientation.","Chapter":192,"Book":"PrincipleNeuralScience","Version":1.0},{"Question":"What is the role of variability in a neuron's response during visual processing?","Answer":"Variability in a neuron\u2019s response, especially along the sensitive flanks of its tuning curve, allows the detection of small stimulus changes that exceed response variability, enhancing perceptual discrimination and supported by probability summation.","Chapter":192,"Book":"PrincipleNeuralScience","Version":1.0},{"Question":"Does the nervous system rely on single neurons (e.g., 'grandmother cells') to represent complex objects like faces?","Answer":"No, the nervous system uses a distributed code where ensembles of neurons represent complex objects, with individual neurons contributing to multiple representations.","Chapter":192,"Book":"PrincipleNeuralScience","Version":1.0},{"Question":"What is the alternative hypothesis to neural firing rates for representing sensory information?","Answer":"The alternative hypothesis is that the timing of action potentials, analogous to Morse code, carries information through the synchronous firing of different neuron groups over time.","Chapter":192,"Book":"PrincipleNeuralScience","Version":1.0},{"Question":"What distinguishes the dorsal and ventral pathways in higher visual processing?","Answer":"The dorsal pathway, in the parietal cortex, is involved in motion perception, attention, and visually guided action, while the ventral pathway, in the temporal cortex, processes form and object recognition, with subdivisions for specialized tasks, such as face recognition.","Chapter":192,"Book":"PrincipleNeuralScience","Version":1.0}]
