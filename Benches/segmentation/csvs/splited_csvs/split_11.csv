Abstract
"The purinergic P2X(7) receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel found on peripheral macrophages and microglia in the nervous system. Activation of P2X(7) receptors results in the rapid release of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Cytokines like IL-1 beta are suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression. The aim of this study was to behaviorally profile P2X(7) receptor knockout (KO) mice in behavioral models of depression- and anxiety-like behaviors. P2X(7) receptor KO and wild type (WT) mice were tested in multiple models including; forced swim test, tail suspension test, elevated plus maze, novelty suppressed feeding, spontaneous locomotor activity, and food intake. P2X(7) receptor KO mice exhibited an antidepressant-like profile in tail suspension test and forced swim test; an effect that was not associated with changes in spontaneous locomotor activity. In addition, P2X(7) receptor KO mice showed higher responsivity to a subefficacious dose of the antidepressant drug imipramine (15 mg/kg) in forced swim test. No significant differences between genotypes were observed in models of anxiety. These data support the relevance of pro-inflammatory cytokines in depressive-like states, and suggest that P2X(7) receptor antagonists could be of potential interest for the treatment of affective disorders."
"The influences of inadequate brain oxygen supply on cognitive and sensorimotor performance are well documented. However, hemodynamic neuroimaging of brain processes under hypoxic conditions has been limited by the organisational constraints of the methodological framework. This study proposes that standardised low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) is a suitable and feasible tool for localising brain cortical processes under hypoxic conditions. Electroencephalograms (EEG) from 21 subjects were recorded prior to, and following 40 min of, exposure to normoxic (21 kPa PIO(2)) or hypoxic (12.7 kPa PIO(2)) conditions, Changes in brain cortical activity were localised using sLORETA. Subjects showed an increase in beta-1 activity following hypoxic exposure. This increase in activity was localised in the right superior frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 10). The results are discussed in terms of the relationship between the activation of prefrontal areas under hypoxic conditions and performance deficits. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that sLORETA can be a valuable and reliable alternative for brain imaging when hemodynamic approaches, such as PET or fMRI, are not feasible."
"The early rearing environment can impact on emotional reactivity and learning later in life. In this study the effects of neonatal maternal separation (MS) on innate fear and fear learning were assessed in the adult female rat. Pups were subjected to MS (360 min), brief handling (H; 15 min), or animal facility rearing (AFR) on post-natal days 2-14. In the first experiment, innate fear was tested in the open field. No differences between the early rearing groups were observed in unconditioned fear. In the second experiment, separate cohorts were used in a 3-day fear learning paradigm which tested the acquisition (Day 1), expression and extinction (both Day 2) of conditioning to an auditory cue; extinction recall was determined as well (Day 3). Contextual fear conditioning was also assessed prior to cue presentations on Days 2 and 3. Whereas MS attenuated the acquisition and expression of fear conditioning to the cue, H potentiated extinction learning. Cue-induced fear was reduced on Day 3, compared to Day 2, indicating that the recall of extinction learning was evident; however, no early rearing group differences in extinction recall were observed. Similarly, while contextual fear was decreased on Day 3, compared to Day 2, there were no differences between the early rearing groups on either day tested. The present findings of altered cue-conditioned fear learning, in the absence of innate fear changes, lend further support for the important role of the early rearing environment in mediating cognition in adulthood."
"When Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) are defeated by a larger, more aggressive opponent, they subsequently produce more defensive and submissive behaviors and less chemosensory investigation and aggression, even when they are paired with a smaller, non-aggressive intruder. This persistent change in the behavior of defeated animals has been termed conditioned defeat. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is important for the acquisition and expression of conditioned defeat. We found that the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol infused into the BNST immediately prior to initial defeat training failed to disrupt the acquisition of conditioned defeat, while muscimol infused prior to testing caused a significant reduction in submissive/defensive behaviors and an increase in investigatory behaviors of the non-aggressive intruder. These results indicate that (1) the BNST, unlike the amygdala, does not appear to be critically involved in the consolidation process related to the memory of social defeat and (2) the BNST may be an important site for the execution of fear behaviors associated with social defeat. Considering the high degree of connectivity between the BNST and the amygdala, these findings provide further insight into the neural circuitry governing conditioned defeat and support the view of a functional dissociation between the amygdala and the BNST in the modulation of conditioned fear in an ethologically relevant model."
"Continuing previous efforts to develop the 4-vessel occlusion (4-VO) model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), here we evaluated whether permanent, stepwise 4-VO causes both learning deficits, hippocampal neurodegeneration and retinal lesion in young, middle-aged or aged rats. Chronic 4-VO was induced by ligation of different sets of vessels, i.e., the vertebral arteries (VA) plus common carotid arteries (CCA) (4-VO/CCA model) or the VA plus internal carotid arteries (ICA) (4-VO/ICA model) with a 1-week interstage interval. Forty days after the 4-VO, the rats were tested for spatial learning impairment, and then examined for hypoxic/ischemic damage. Young, 4-VO/CCA rats exhibited cognitive impairment, hippocampal neurodegeneration and retinal lesion (p&lt;0.0001-0.05). After 4-VO/ICA, neither young nor middle-aged rats exhibited any learning deficits, hippocampal or retinal damage. In aged rats, chronic 4-VO/ICA caused a mild learning deficit (p&lt;0.05). A significant effect of training was observed for the old, sham-operated rats (p&lt;0.0001-0.001), but not for the aged 4-VO/ICA rats (p&gt;0.05). On average, hippocampal cell density did not change after 4-VO/ICA in aged rats, but 3 of 10 subjects exhibited reduced pyramidal cell counts in all hippocampal subfields. Retinal morphology appeared to be unaffected in the 4-VO/ICA aged rats. These data suggest that the 4-VO/ICA model, but not the 4-VO/CCA model, is a suitable paradigm to study the behavioral outcome of CCH given the preservation of the retina after 4-VO/ICA. Moreover, the age at which 4-VO/ICA occurs seems to be an important factor for determining the behavioral and neuropathological changes."
"Sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids (gangliosides) have been believed to play a role in the regulation and protection of nervous tissues. To clarify their function in the nervous system in vivo, double knockout (DKO) mice of GM2/GD2 synthase and GD3 synthase genes were generated and abnormal behaviors were analyzed. Mutant mice exhibited reduced weight and a round shape of the whole brain that progressively emerged with aging, and displayed motor dysfunction in the footprint, traction, open-field, and 24h locomotion activity tests. Sensory functions were also reduced in the von Frey and hot plate tests and greatly reduced in the acoustic startle response test. For emotional behavior, fear response was clearly decreased. Numerous neuronal dysfunctions were found even in younger mutant mice examined at 10-23 weeks after birth, which were exacerbated with aging. These results suggest that a lack of gangliosides other than GM3 induces severe neuronal degeneration in the early stage of life, and that the expression of complex gangliosides is essential to maintain the integrity of the nervous system throughout life."
"Repeated exposure to stressors was reported to increase the expression of arginine-vasopressin (AVP), especially in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons co-expressing AVP, within the hypothalamus. This may increase the potential for subsequent stressor-elicited enhancement of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) functioning as these peptides synergistically stimulate pituitary ACTH secretion. Likewise, members of the bombesin (BB) family of peptides (including its mammalian analogues gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and neuromedin B (NMB)) stimulate the release of ACTH and may play a role in the mediation and/or modulation of the CRH stress response. In the present investigation, chronic stressor exposure (daily restraint over 14 days) was associated with increased co-expression of CRH and AVP at the median eminence. In addition, in vivo interstitial levels of anterior pituitary AVP, GRP and NMB (but not CRH) were elevated following chronic stressor exposure. Basal pituitary corticosterone levels, in contrast, were unaffected by chronic stressor exposure. Following consumption of a highly palatable snack, interstitial levels of CRH, GRP, NMB and corticosterone (but not AVP) were elevated at the pituitary; however, a cross-sensitization was not apparent among rats previously exposed to the stressor and then provided with the snack. As the CRH, AVP and BB-like peptide systems have been associated with altered anxiety and depressive symptoms, the sustained peptidergic alterations observed in the chronically stressed rats may have implications for the development of these stressor-related disorders."
"Studies have shown that disturbed sleep produced by chronic alcohol abuse in humans can predict relapse drinking after periods of abstinence. How alcohol produces disturbed sleep remains unknown. In this study we used a novel analysis of sleep to examine the effects of alcohol on sleep patterns in rats. This analysis separates waking into multiple components and defines a period labeled vigilance cycling (VC) in which the rat rapidly cycles through various vigilance states. These VC episodes are separated by long duration wake (LDW) periods. We find that 6 weeks of alcohol (6% in a liquid diet) caused fragmentation of extended VC episodes that normally occur in the light period. However, total daily amounts of slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid-eye movement sleep (REMS) remained constant. The daily amount of wake, SWS, and REMS remained constant because the alcohol treated rats increased the amount of VC in the dark period, and the sleep nature of VC in the dark period became more intense. In addition, we observed more wake and less REMS early in the light period in alcohol treated rats. All effects completely reversed by day 16 of alcohol withdrawal. Comparison of the effects of chronic alcohol to acute alcohol exposure demonstrated the effects of chronic alcohol are due to adaptation and not the acute presence of alcohol. The effects of chronic alcohol treatment in rats mimic the effects reported in humans (REMS suppression, difficulty falling asleep, and difficulty remaining asleep)."
"Recognizing the individual and sexual identities of conspecifics is critical for adaptive social behavior and, in most mammals this information is communicated primarily by chemosensory cues. Due to its heavy reliance on odor cues, we have used the Syrian hamster as our model species for investigating the neural regulation of social recognition. Using lesion, electrophysiological and immunocytochemical techniques, separate neural pathways underlying recognition of individual odors and guidance of sex-typical responses to opposite-sex odors have been identified in both male and female hamsters. Specifically, we have found that recognition of individual odor identity requires olfactory bulb connections to entorhinal cortex (ENT) rather than other chemoreceptive brain regions. This kind of social memory does not appear to require the hippocampus and may, instead, depend on ENT connections with piriform cortex. In contrast, sexual recognition, through either differential investigation or scent marking toward opposite-sex odors, depends on both olfactory and vomeronasal system input to the corticomedial amygdala. Preference for investigating opposite-sex odors requires primarily olfactory input to the medial amygdala (ME) whereas appropriately targeted scent marking responses require vomeronasal input to ME as well as to other structures. Within the ME, the anterior section (MEa) appears important for evaluating or classifying social odors whereas the posterodorsal region (MEpd) may be more involved in generating approach to social odors. Evidence is presented that analysis of social odors may initially be done in MEa and then communicated to MEpd, perhaps through micro-circuits that separately process male and female odors."
"The capacity to seek and obtain rewards is essential for survival. Pavlovian conditioning is one mechanism by which organisms develop predictions about rewards and such anticipatory or expectancy states enable successful behavioral adaptations to environmental demands. Reward expectancies have both affective/motivational and discriminative properties that allow for the modulation of instrumental goal-directed behavior. Recent data provide evidence that different cognitive strategies (cue-outcome associations) and neural systems (amygdala) are used when subjects are trained under conditions that allow Pavlovian-induced reward expectancies to guide instrumental behavioral choices. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that impairments typically observed in a number of brain-damaged models are alleviated or eliminated by embedding unique reward expectancies into learning/memory tasks. These results suggest that Pavlovian-induced reward expectancies can change both behavioral and brain processes."
"Evaluation of spatial learning and memory is mainly carried out using the Morris water maze as a single paradigm. We intended to test whether mice in the Barnes maze and Multiple T-maze would lead to comparable results and to test two individual mouse strains with different anxiety levels. C57BL/6J and CD1 male mice were used in the experiments. During the acquisition phase, learning was measured using parameters latency, path length, errors in the BM and correct decisions in MTM. Mice were trained for 4 days and probe trials were performed on days 5 and 12. Latencies reduction over the training period indicated that both strains learned all tasks. During retention phase at days 5 and 12 C57BL/6J performed the Barnes maze and Multiple T-maze task better than CD1 mice while CD1 performed better than C57BL/6J in the Morris water maze. In the BM at day 12, C57BL/6J kept the level of visits to target observed at day 5 whereas CD1 performed worse. Strain- and task-dependent differences were observed using the three mazes. Therefore, fair evaluation of spatial memory demands application of (at least) two different test systems, a water- and a land maze. Different anxiety-related behaviour as well as stress-responses in the strains used may help to interpret the findings reported and again may propose the use of at least two mouse strains when robust evaluation of spatial memory is considered."
"Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity occurs in several parts of the basal ganglia. Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that activity-dependent plasticity underlies the acquisition, maintenance, and extinction of certain types of learning in the basal ganglia. This review focuses on synaptic plasticity in the corticostriatal pathway. As in other systems, both long-term potentiation and long-term depression have been described, and intracellular calcium signalling plays an important role in the induction of plasticity. However, intracellular calcium levels do not appear to be the dominating control factor. Dopamine, via intracellular signalling cascades, also plays a crucial role in determining the magnitude and direction of plasticity, and in modulating the requirements for induction. Endocannabinoids also play an important role in mediating presynaptic expression of synaptic depression. Recent studies have highlighted spike-timing dependent plasticity phenomena, which also involve dopamine and endocannabinoid signalling. Despite significant progress in recent years, many important questions remain unanswered, especially in relation to long-term potentiation. Of particular interest is the question of how to link the molecular and cellular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity to learning operations at the systems level, which are expressed behaviourally as reinforcement-related learning."
"Early-life stress during the postnatal period could precipitate long-lasting alterations in the functional properties underlying emotional expression in humans, but how the psychological stress of cross-fostering affects emotional behavior during adulthood in mice remains primarily unknown. The purpose of the present study was to examine the long-term effects of cross-fostering on the emotional behavior and cognitive functions of ICR offspring in adulthood. Cross-fostering was performed from postnatal day 7 for 3 weeks. Mice were divided into three groups: (1) biological group: pups born from ICR dams fostered by their original mothers; (2) in-foster group: pups born from ICR dams but adopted by other ICR dams and (3) cross-foster group: ICR pups adopted by C57 dams. ICR mice were subjected to behavioral experiments at the age of 8 weeks. Emotional behaviors in the cross-fostered mice were significantly altered in the open-field, elevated plus maze and forced swimming tests, as well as social interaction tests. However, the cross-fostered mice showed normal memory function in the Y-maze and novel object recognition tests. The contents of serotonin metabolisms were decreased in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus indicated the deficit of serotoninergic neuronal function by cross-fostering. These findings suggested that the early-life stress of cross-fostering induced long-lasting emotional abnormalities, which might be possibly related to alterations of serotonin metabolisms."
"We investigated gender differences in motor performance in 9-, 12-, and 17-year-olds. The tasks included simple thumb tapping (sTT), handwriting (HW) and finger-to-thumb opposition sequence (FOS) learning. In sTT there was a significant advantage for the 17-year-old males. In HW, 12-year-old females were faster, initially, than the males, but this gap was closed by a single training session; in the 17-year-olds although no significant difference was found initially, the males became faster than the age-matched females post-training. In the FOS, there were no initial gender differences (speed or accuracy). However, males benefited more from training, with the 17-year-old males attaining a significant post-training speed advantage. Moreover, males, of all three age-groups, evolved significantly larger delayed (""off-line"") performance gains in the FOS task compared to females; gains which were retained 6-weeks post-training. There may be a male advantage in motor learning rather than in motor performance per-se; this advantage is enhanced during adolescence."
"Recent research in instrumental conditioning has focused on the striatum, particularly the role of the dorsal striatum in the learning processes that contribute to instrumental performance in rats. This research has found evidence of what appear to be parallel, functionally and anatomically distinct circuits involving dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) that contribute to two independent instrumental learning processes. Evidence suggests that the formation of the critical action-outcome associations mediating goal-directed action are localized to the dorsomedial striatum, whereas the sensorimotor connections that control the performance of habitual actions are localized to the dorsolateral striatum. In addition to the dorsal striatum, these learning processes appear to engage distinct cortico-striatal networks and to be embedded in a complex of converging and partially segregated loops that constitute the cortico-striatal thalamo-cortical feedback circuit. As the entry point for the basal ganglia, cortical circuits involving the dorsal striatum are clearly in a position to control a variety of motor functions but, as recent studies of various neurodegenerative disorders have made clear, they are also involved in a number of cognitive and executive functions including action selection, planning, and decision-making."
"Research indicates that dysfunctional food reward processing may contribute to pathological eating behaviour. It is widely recognized that both the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are essential parts of the brain's reward circuitry. The aims of this fMRI study were (1) to examine the effects of food deprivation and calorie content on reward processing in the amygdala and the OFC, and (2) to examine whether an explicit evaluation of foods is necessary for OFC, but not amygdalar activity. Addressing the first aim, healthy females were presented with high and low calorie food pictures while being either hungry or satiated. For the second aim, attention focus was manipulated by directing participants' attention either to the food or to a neutral aspect. This study shows that hunger interacts with the energy content of foods, modulating activity in the posterior cingulate cortex, medial OFC, insula, caudate putamen and fusiform gyrus. Results show that satiated healthy females show an increased reward processing in response to low calorie foods. Confirming our hypothesis, food deprivation increased activity following the presentation of high calorie foods, which may explain why treatments of obesity energy restricting diets often are unsuccessful. Interestingly, activity in both the amygdala and mOFC was only evident when participants explicitly evaluated foods. However, attention independent activity was found in the mPFC following the high calorie foods cues when participants where hungry. Current findings indicate that research on how attention modulates food reward processing might prove especially insightful in the study of the neural substrates of healthy and pathological eating behaviour."
"The involvement of thalamic midline nuclei (MLN) in early stage of Alzheimer's disease and in diencephalic amnesia has drawn attention to the connectivity between the nucleus reuniens (RE) and structures of medial temporal lobe. RE is major source of thalamic afferents to the hippocampus and has been shown to exert powerful excitatory action on CA1 of hippocampus, which is supposed to be involved in learning and memory processes. However, the role of the RE on spatial memory is a controversial issue. The present study was designed to evaluate the role of the RE in acquisition, consolidation and retrieval of spatial reference memory (RM) and working memory (WM). We assessed the effect of reversible inactivation of RE with tetracaine (0.5 microl, 2%) on different stages of memory. Rats were trained on RM and WM versions of the Morris water maze (MWM) task. RE was inactivated before or immediately after training or before the probe trial of retrieval tests. The data showed that reversible inactivation of the RE significantly impaired both RM and WM versions of MWM. Therefore, it seems that nucleus reuniens of thalamus plays a role in spatial RM and WM version of the MWM task in rats."
"Modern theoretical accounts on reward-based learning are commonly based on reinforcement learning algorithms. Most noted in this context is the temporal-difference (TD) algorithm in which the difference between predicted and obtained reward, the prediction-error, serves as a learning signal. Consequently, larger rewards cause bigger prediction-errors and lead to faster learning than smaller rewards. Therefore, if animals employ a neural implementation of TD learning, reward-magnitude should affect learning in animals accordingly. Here we test this prediction by training pigeons on a simple color-discrimination task with two pairs of colors. In each pair, correct discrimination is rewarded; in pair one with a large-reward, in pair two with a small-reward. Pigeons acquired the 'large-reward' discrimination faster than the 'small-reward' discrimination. Animal behavior and an implementation of the TD-algorithm yielded comparable results with respect to the difference between learning curves in the large-reward and in the small-reward conditions. We conclude that the influence of reward-magnitude on the acquisition of a simple discrimination paradigm is accurately reflected by a TD implementation of reinforcement learning."
"The chronic mild stress (CMS) protocol is widely used to evoke depressive-like behaviours in laboratory rats. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of chronic stress on cognitive performance. About 70% of rats exposed to 7 weeks of chronic mild stress showed a gradual reduction in consumption of a sucrose solution, indicating an anhedonic-like state. The remaining rats did not reduce their sucrose intake, but appeared resilient to the stress-induced effects on sucrose intake. Cognitive profiling of the CMS rats revealed that chronic stress had a negative effect on performance in the spontaneous alternation test, possibly reflecting a deficit in working memory. This effect was independent of whether the stressed rats were anhedonic-like or stress-resilient as measured by their sucrose intake. CMS did not influence performance in passive avoidance and auditory cued fear conditioning, however, in rats displaying an anhedonic-like profile, CMS increased freezing behaviour in contextual fear conditioning."
"Prefrontocortical dopamine (DA) plays an essential role in the representation of reward value and is implicated in behavioral flexibility. We here tested the effect of systemic and local blockade of DA D1- and D2-receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) by using an operant paradigm, where rats have to adjust their behavior to changing reward value. Rats were trained in a Skinner box, where different numbers of lever-presses for pellet-rewards were assigned to and switched between two levers. After rats commit to the efficient lever the lever-occupancy reversed and rats had to switch to the now efficient one. Rats were either intraperitoneally injected with the DA D1-receptor antagonist SCH23390 (40 microg/kg), the DA D2-receptor antagonist sulpiride (10mg/kg), or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Two other groups received bilateral local mPFC- or OFC-infusions of SCH23390, sulpiride (both 3 microg/0.5 microl), or PBS (0.5 microl) through previously implanted cannulae. After initial detection of reverse of lever-occupancy, systemic and local blockade of D1-receptors increased the number of switches back to the previously efficient lever, thus reducing the total number of reverses completed. D2-receptor blockade deteriorated this measure after local mPFC-infusion. Notably, initial detection of reverse of lever-occupancy was not affected. Blockade of DA receptors within the prefrontal cortex do not deteriorate the detection of changes in reward value, whereas maintenance of behavioral adaptation is disturbed. Interestingly, blockade of DA receptors in the mPFC and OFC had similar effects, i.e., these regions apparently act in a cooperative manner."
"The aim of the present study was to further explore the neuronal mechanisms of face processing in healthy subjects which may help to understand the difficulties experienced by prosopagnosia subjects. A further goal was to compare face specific activation patterns in the right and left occipital face area (OFA) and fusiform face area (FFA) for famous faces, non-famous faces and caricatures of famous faces in four individuals suffering from developmental prosopagnosia (DP) and seven healthy controls, using functional magnetic resonance imaging and psychophysiological interaction analysis (PPI). Control subjects showed higher face related activations in the right compared to the left FFA. Caricatures of faces of famous people and photographs of non-famous faces yielded higher percent signal changes in the OFA and FFA compared to photographs of famous faces. These data support the idea that the OFA and FFA discriminate between familiar and new face representations. The activation patterns of DP subjects were heterogeneous, with none of the patients showing bilateral face related activations in both OFA and FFA. There was no evidence of a left hemispheric activation when the right homologue failed to be activated, supporting the view of a right hemispheric dominance in face perception. PPI analysis indicated a link between activation of the right FFA and the other three tested regions, the left FFA and the right and left OFA. In summary, all four face related brain regions appear to be necessary for successful face processing, and disruption of one component may lead to face recognition deficits."
"I present an fMRI study demonstrating that a mimic word highly suggestive of human walking, heard by the ear with eyes closed, significantly activates the visual cortex located in extrastriate occipital region (BA19, 18) and superior temporal sulcus (STS) while hearing non-sense words that do not imply walk under the same task does not activate these areas in humans. I concluded that BA19 and 18 would be a critical region for generating visual images of walking and related intentional stance, respectively, evoked by an onomatopoeia word that implied walking."
"The effects of estrogen on anxiety-like behaviors have been widely studied but the mechanisms responsible are still inconclusive. The purpose of the current study was to compare the effects of transient high levels of endogenous estrogen and chronic exogenous estrogen treatment on the anxiety-like behaviors using the elevated T-maze (ETM) test. In addition, serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite (5-HIAA), serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) and tryptophan hydroxylase enzyme (TPH) were measured at the end of the study and correlated to the task performances. Female sham-operated rats in proestrous phase (Sham-Pro) and ovariectomized rats treated with or without 17beta-estradiol (10 microg/kg, s.c.; Ovx+E(2) or Ovx) for 4 weeks were used. In the ETM test, the Ovx+E(2) group had reduced inhibitory avoidance responses compared to others, suggesting that exogenous E(2) replacement is anxiolytic, while escape latency was prolonged in the Sham-Pro group suggesting endogenous E(2) is panicolytic. Further, the serotonin turnover rate (5-HIAA/5-HT ratio) in the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens was highest in the Ovx+E(2) group. While the TPH protein in the midbrain of Ovx rats was significantly higher than others, the SERT levels were not significantly different among groups in all measured brain areas. In conclusion, Ovx rats with chronic estrogen administration and Sham-Pro rats with naturally high levels of estrogen, demonstrated anxiolytic behavior by exhibiting different forms of anxiety that related to the changes in the function of serotonergic system."
"The zebrafish olfactory system is an attractive model for studying neural processing of chemosensory information. Here we characterize zebrafish olfactory behaviors and their modification through learning, using an apparatus consisting of a circular flow-through tank that allows controlled administration of odorants. When exposed to the amino acids l-alanine and l-valine, naive zebrafish responded with appetitive swimming behavior, which we measured as the number of &gt;90 degrees turns made during 30s observation periods. Such appetitive responses were not observed when naive zebrafish were exposed to an unnatural odorant, phenylethyl alcohol (PEA). Repeated pairing of amino acids or PEA (conditioned stimuli, CS) with food flakes (unconditioned stimuli; UCS) increased odorant-evoked appetitive swimming behavior in all fish tested. The zebrafish also learned to restrict this behavior to the vicinity of a feeding ring, through which UCS were administered. When both nares were temporarily occluded, conditioned fish failed to respond to odorants, confirming that these behaviors were mediated by olfaction. These results represent the first demonstration of a classically conditioned appetitive response to a behaviorally neutral odorant in fish. Furthermore, they complement recent demonstrations of conditional place preferences in fish. By virtue of its robustness and simplicity, this method will be a useful tool for future research into the biological basis of olfactory learning in zebrafish."
"Male mouse urine contains a complex mixture of chemosignals, which signal the presence of a reproductively active male. These have powerful effects as primer pheromones on female reproductive state, including the ability to block pregnancy. Male mouse urine also contains individuality chemosignals that enable the female to recognise her mate and prevent his pheromones from eliciting the pregnancy block effect. A range of neurochemical and electrophysiological evidence suggests that memory formation to the mating male's pheromones involves synaptic changes in the accessory olfactory bulb, at the first stage of the vomeronasal pathway. This results in a selective inhibition of the mate's pheromonal signal, preventing it from activating neural circuits in the corticomedial amygdala and hypothalamus that mediate the endocrine changes responsible for pregnancy block. This article reviews the current state of knowledge regarding the neurobiological basis of this mate recognition, highlighting important gaps in our current understanding. Despite recent findings of the ability of peptides associated with the major histocompatibility complex to influence mate recognition, the pregnancy blocking and individuality chemosignals remain to be identified. Recent research has also shed doubt on our understanding of the mechanism by which noradrenaline imprints the male pheromonal signal. Finally, the effect of learning on the transmission of information in the vomeronasal system and its relationship to chemosensory information processed by the main olfactory system remain to be elucidated."
"This review article discusses mechanisms of how distinct behavioral operations are organized by different modules distributed in the frontal cortex. Cognitive manipulation often requires a flow of multiple elementary sub-operations processed in specialized brain regions. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is likely responsible for attentional selection, which orients organisms' mental resources to behaviorally relevant information. The dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) is implicated to possess a functional gradient along the rostral-caudal axis. The rostral sector of the PMd (pre-PMd) is involved in various cognitive/premovement processes while its caudal sector (PMd proper) primarily controls actual movement. Neurophysiology studies in monkeys have shown that the pre-PMd, when functionally coupled with the dlPFC, may transform independent working memory items into a single sequence (sequence generation). A neuroimaging study has shown that the pre-PMd is indeed involved in sequence generation under the influence of the dlPFC in humans. It has been also indicated that the dlPFC and the pre-PMd are functionally coupled when attentional selection and sequence generation are to be unified for serial information processing. Functional interplay through the prefrontal-premotor connections may mediate the integration of specific sub-operations for multi-step cognitive manipulation. Furthermore, evidence from a meta-analysis of the imaging literature is argued for an idea that the coupling pattern with other frontal cortical areas may characterize of the function of the pre-PMd and PMd proper in various motor and cognitive tasks."
"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is accompanied by a ""diabetic encephalopathy"" including hypersensitivity to stress, increased risk of stroke, dementia and cognitive impairment. In previous works we reported several brain alterations including a strong decrease in hippocampal proliferation and survival in both spontaneous and streptozotocin-induced models of experimental T1D. The aim of this study was to explore in streptozotocin-treated mice and other parameters associated to mild neurodegeneration in the dentate gyrus and the potential correlation with behavioural changes. The neurogenic status, measured by doublecortin (DCX) expression, showed an important decline in the number of positive cells in the subgranular zone (SGZ). However, neuronal migration was not affected. We found a marked enhancement of intracellular lipofuscin deposits, characteristic of increased oxidative stress and aging in both, the hilus and the SGZ and granular cell layer (GCL). Diabetic mice showed a significant impairment in learning and memory tests, exhibiting a higher latency to show an escape response and a poorer learning efficiency of an active avoiding response compared with control mice. Both, exploratory and non-exploratory activities in a conflictive environment in the asymmetric elevated plus maze were not affected by the diabetic condition. In conclusion, experimental diabetes showed clear signs of changes in the dentate gyrus, changes similar to those present in the aging process. Correlatively, these alterations were in line with a reduced performance in learning and memory tests. The mechanism that could potentially link neural and behavioural disturbances is not yet fully comprehended."
"Motor learning disturbances have been shown in diseases involving dopamine insufficiency such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenic patients under antipsychotic drug treatment. In non-human primates, motor learning deficits have also been observed following systemic administration of raclopride, a selective D2-receptor antagonist. These deficits were characterized by persistent fluctuations of performance from trial to trial, and were described as difficulties in consolidating movements following a learning period. Moreover, it has been suggested that these raclopride-induced fluctuations can result from impediments in grouping separate movements into one fluent sequence. In the present study, we explore the hypothesis that such fluctuations during movement consolidation can be prevented through the use of sumanirole - a highly selective D2 agonist - if administered before raclopride. Two monkeys were trained to execute a well known sequence of movements, which was later recalled under three pharmacological conditions: (1) no drug, (2) raclopride, and (3) sumanirole+raclopride. The same three pharmacological conditions were repeated with the two monkeys, trained this time to learn new sequences of movements. Results show that raclopride has no deleterious effect on the well known sequence, nor the sumanirole+raclopride co-administration. However, results on the new sequence to be learned revealed continuous fluctuations of performances in the raclopride condition, but not in the sumanirole+raclopride condition. These fluctuations occurred concurrently with a difficulty in merging separate movement components, known as a ""chunking deficit"". D2 receptors seem therefore to be involved in the consolidation of new motor skills, and this might involve the chunking of separate movements into integrated motor sequences."
"The aim of the present study was to investigate whether neonatal odor experience associated with the mother affects food avoidance learning and basolateral amygdala (BLA) involvement in adulthood. Odorization of mother's nipples with banana or almond solutions from birth to weaning resulted in an impairment at adulthood of conditioned odor aversion (COA). These effects were specific to the early-experienced odor since no deficit was observed for COA to a novel odor (Experiment 1). In contrast, mere exposure to an odor in the home cage instead of on mother's nipples induced no deficit in COA at adulthood (Experiment 2). Finally, transitory inactivation of the BLA during COA acquisition in adult animals impaired the normal COA of na&#xef;ve animals but also the attenuated COA of rats with early odor experience on the mother (Experiment 3). These results demonstrate that neonatal odor experience associated with the mother promotes the acquisition of appetitive memories which can interfere with food avoidance learning in adulthood. They also suggest that this early experience did not modify the BLA involvement in learned aversion."
"Preclinical studies must rigorously assess whether putative therapies improve motor and cognitive function following brain injury. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) causes significant sensory-motor and cognitive deficits in humans. However, no study has evaluated cognition in rodent ICH models. Thus, we used a battery of tests to comprehensively examine whether a striatal ICH causes cognitive impairments in rats. Bacterial collagenase (or sterile saline for SHAM surgery) was injected into the striatum to create an ICH. Two days later, functional deficits were assessed using a neurological deficit scale (NDS), which is most sensitive to ICH injury. Sensory and/or motor deficits may confound cognitive testing; thus, we waited until these had resolved before testing learning and memory. Testing was conducted 1-7 months after ICH and included spontaneous alternation, elevated plus maze, open-field, Morris water maze, T-maze (win-shift and win-stay paradigms), and the radial arm maze (eight and four arms baited protocols). Significant motor deficits at 2 days completely resolved by 1 month, at which time cognitive testing began. In contrast to persistent cognitive deficits that occur after ICH in humans, we did not detect significant learning or memory deficits after ICH in rats. Our results suggest that these tests will not likely be useful for assessing outcome in experimental ICH studies. In conclusion, animal models that better mimic clinical ICH (both motor and cognitive deficits) must be developed. This may include increasing ICH severity or injuring other functional subdivisions within the striatum that may lead to more profound cognitive deficits."
"Synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) is involved in neurotransmitter release and has been identified as the binding site for levetiracetam (Keppra), a novel antiepileptic drug. Homozygous SV2A (-/-) mice are not viable beyond a few weeks. In contrast, heterozygous SV2A (+/-) mice have a normal lifespan. We performed a behavioural phenotyping on SV2A (+/-) mice in a battery of tests: gross behavioural observation, spontaneous locomotor activity, sensori-motor coordination, acute pain sensitivity, exploration in an elevated plus-maze and an assessment of learning abilities in an inhibitory avoidance procedure. SV2A (+/-) mice were compared to age-matched, 2-month-old wild type controls. Overall, gross behaviour, spontaneous locomotor activity, sensori-motor coordination and acute pain sensitivity were comparable between wild type and SV2A (+/-) mice. When tested in a plus-maze, SV2A (+/-) mice displayed significant increased avoidance of open elevated arms whereas locomotor activity was not altered. Finally, both SV2A (+/-) and wild type mice showed comparable memory performance at the end of a multi-trial passive avoidance procedure. Interestingly, SV2A (+/-) mice exhibited increased avoidance of the lit area during the first sessions without foot shock. These results suggest an anxiety-like phenotype for SV2A (+/-) mice indicated by increased open-arm avoidance in the elevated plus-maze test as well as a shorter latency to escape from a lit area in the inhibitory avoidance procedure."
"The excitatory amino acids (EAA) L-glutamate (L-Glu), L-aspartate (L-Asp) and D-aspartate (D-Asp) are thought to play a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator role in neuronal communications. Recently, a high level of EAA L-Glu, D- and L-Asp isomers has been found in the forebrain of Naples high-excitability (NHE) rat line that models the mesocortical variant of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The aim of this study was to assess the functions of D-Asp using two forms, i.e. free D-Asp or D-Asp diethyl ester (DEE) as prodrug, on brain and behaviour. Thus, prepuberal rats were given, for two weeks daily, an i.p. injection of D-Asp or DEE or vehicle. Then rats were exposed to two spatial novelties i.e. L&#xe0;t and radial Olton maze. Behaviour was monitored for indices of activity, non-selective attention (NSA), selective spatial attention (SSA) and emotional reactivity. L-Glu and D- and L-Asp were detected by HPLC in cognitive and non-cognitive brain areas such as prefrontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus and hypothalamus. Results indicate that subchronic D-Asp or DEE (i) reduced EAA levels in the NHE and increased it in the random-bred controls (NRB) rats, (ii) in the L&#xe0;t-maze D-Asp increased horizontal activity in NHE but DEE decreased it in NRB rats, (iii) in the Olton maze D-Asp and DEE decreased vertical activity in NHE and NRB rats respectively, (iv) D-Asp impaired attention only in NRB decreasing number of arms visited before first repetition. Therefore, data demonstrate differential effects of prepuberal subchronic D-Asp and DEE that may be related to different basal EAA levels in NHE and NRB rats."
"Separate groups of food-deprived rats were given 2h access to food after receiving bilateral nucleus accumbens infusions of the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine methyl bromide (at 0, 1.0, and 10.0 microg/side), the M2-preferring agonist oxotremorine sesquifumarate (Oxo-S; at 0, 1.0, or 10.0 microg/side) or the M2 antagonist AFDX-116 (at 0, 0.2, or 1.0 microg/side). Injections of scopolamine or Oxo-S, but not AFDX-116, reduced food consumption across the 2h. These experiments confirm a critical role for Acb acetylcholine in promoting food ingestion, and suggest that decreased acetylcholine tone at post-synaptic muscarinic receptors disrupts normal consummatory behavior."
"Forebrain association areas interweave perceived stimuli with acquired representations of own actions and their outcome. Often, relevant stimuli come in a bewildering variety of shapes and sizes and we slowly have to learn to group them into meaningful categories. Therefore, the aim of the present study was twofold: First, to reveal how single units in the pigeon's nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), a functional analogue of the mammalian prefrontal cortex (PFC), encode stimuli that differ in visual features but not in behavioral relevance. The second aim was to understand how these categorical representations are established during learning. Recordings were made from NCL neurons while pigeons performed a go-nogo categorization paradigm. Responses during presentation of the two S+ stimuli and non-responding during presentation of the two S- stimuli were followed by reward. We recorded from two pigeons at different learning stages. In the beginning of the learning process, neurons were active during and shortly before reward, but only in go trials. These data suggest that during the early phase of learning avian 'prefrontal' neurons code for rewards associated with the same behavioral demand, while ignoring feature differences of stimuli within one category. When learning progressed, (1) category selectivity became stronger, (2) responses selective for nogo stimuli appeared, and (3) reward-related responses disappeared in favor of category-selective responses during the stimulus phase. This backward shift in time resembles response patterns assumed by the temporal difference (TD) model of reinforcement learning, but goes beyond it, since it reflects the neuronal correlate of functional categories."
"The serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor sibutramine has been licensed as an anti-obesity treatment for more than a decade. However, while inhibitory effects on food intake and weight gain are well documented, surprisingly little published detail exists regarding its influence on feeding and related behaviours. The present study was therefore designed to assess the effects of acute sibutramine treatment on food intake, the behavioural satiety sequence (BSS) and post-treatment weight gain. Subjects were 10 non-deprived adult male Lister hooded rats, tested with 0.5-3.0 mg/kg sibutramine hydrochloride during 1-h DVD-recorded test sessions with palatable mash. Our results show that sibutramine dose-dependently reduced food intake, an effect significant at all doses tested. Ethological analysis revealed very few behavioural effects, except for a dose-dependent reduction in time spent feeding and an increase in the frequency of resting. Behavioural specificity was further supported by time-bin analysis which confirmed both the structural integrity and dose-dependent acceleration of the BSS. Single dosing with sibutramine (3.0 mg/kg) also suppressed daily weight gain over the 24-72 h period post-dosing. Current data support the conclusion that the acute anorectic and weight loss efficacy of sibutramine in adult male rats is not secondary to behavioural disruption but, instead, is due largely to an acceleration in behavioural satiety."
"This review discusses the cerebral plasticity, and the role of the cortico-striatal system in particular, observed as one is learning or planning to execute a newly learned motor behavior up to when the skill is consolidated or has become highly automatized. A special emphasis is given to imaging work describing the neural substrate mediating motor sequence learning and motor adaptation paradigms. These results are then put into a plausible neurobiological model of motor skill learning, which proposes an integrated view of the brain plasticity mediating this form of memory at different stages of the acquisition process."
"The aim of this study was to examine the effect of a polyphenol-rich extract (PrB) of Vaccinium angustifolium (wild blueberries) introduced intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 30 (PrB30) and 60 (PrB60) mg/kg body weight for 7 days, on cognitive performance, brain oxidative status and acetylcholinesterase activity in adult, male, 3-4-month-old Balb-c mice. Evaluation of rodent learning and memory was assessed by a step-through test on day 6 after a double training and an initial acquisition trial on day 5. Antioxidant status was determined by ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), ascorbic acid concentration (FRASC), malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione levels in whole brain homogenates. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was determined by Ellman's colorimetric method. Results showed that the PrB60-treated mice exhibited a significant improvement in learning and memory (step-through latency time of 228+/-38 s compared to 101+/-32 s of the control group). PrB extract administration also resulted in reduced lipid peroxidation products (38 and 79%) and higher brain ascorbic acid levels (21 and 64%) in both PrB30 and PrB60-treated groups, respectively, and higher glutathione levels (28%) in the PrB60-treated group. Furthermore, salt- and detergent soluble AChE activity significantly decreased in both PrB-treated groups. Thus, the significant cognitive enhancement observed in adult mice after short-term i.p. supplementation with the blueberry extract concentrated in polyphenols, is closely related to higher brain antioxidant properties and inhibition of AChE activity. These findings stress the critical impact of wild blueberry bioactive components on brain function."
"The striatum has long been considered to be selectively important for nondeclarative, procedural types of memory. This stands in contrast with spatial context processing that is typically attributed to hippocampus. Neurophysiological evidence from studies of the neural mechanisms of adaptive navigation reveals that distinct neural systems such as the striatum and hippocampus continuously process task relevant information regardless of the current cognitive strategy. For example, both striatal and hippocampal neural representations reflect spatial location, directional heading, reward, and egocentric movement features of a test situation in an experience-dependent way, and independent of task demands. Thus, continual parallel processing across memory systems may be the norm rather than the exception. It is suggested that neuromodulators, such as dopamine, may serve to differentially regulate learning-induced neural plasticity mechanisms within these memory systems such that the most successful form of neural processing exerts the strongest control over response selection functions. In this way, dopamine may serve to optimize behavioral choices in the face of changing environmental demands during navigation."
"People with hepatic insufficiency can develop hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a complex neuropsychological syndrome covering a wide range of neurological and cognitive and motor alterations. The cognitive deficits include disturbances in intellectual functions such as memory and learning. In spite of its high prevalence in western societies, the causes of HE have not yet been clearly established. For this reason, experimental models of HE are used to study this condition. In this work, two experimental models were used, one Type B HE (portacaval shunt) and the other Type C HE (cirrhosis by intoxication with thioacetamide), to evaluate its effect on two tasks of associative learning: two-way active avoidance and step-through passive avoidance. The results show an impediment both in acquisition and retention of active avoidance in both models of HE. However, in passive avoidance, only the rats with portacaval shunt presented a memory deficit for the aversive event. In our opinion, these results can be explained by alterations in the neurotransmission system presented by animals with hepatic insufficiency, which are mainly caused by a rise in cerebral histamine and a dysfunction of the glutamatergic system."
"Growth factors in the brain are important to depression and it's treatment and we assessed the ability of peripherally administered insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) to influence behavior related to depression. We found that mice that received chronic IGF-I treatment showed antidepressant-like behavior in forced-swim and novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) tests and increased sucrose consumption after chronic mild unpredictable stress exposure. Additionally, peripheral anti-IGF-I administration blocked exercise-induced antidepressant effects in the forced-swim test (FST). These results support the functional relevance of neurotrophic mechanisms to depression and extend this idea to include neurotrophic factors in the periphery."
"Oxidative stress and reduced brain glutathione (GSH) levels have been reported in psychiatric illnesses including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. However the role of GSH in cognitive impairment in the illness remains unclear. Treatment of Sprague-Dawley rats and C57Bl/6 mice with 2-cyclohexene-1-one (CHX) dose-dependently reduced striatal and frontal cortical GSH levels similar to those in schizophrenia. In both species, GSH depletion resulted in disruption of short-term spatial recognition memory in a Y-maze test. In conclusion, GSH depletion induces cognitive impairment, which may be relevant to the role of GSH in psychiatric illnesses."
"The endovascular perforation model of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a commonly used model in rats as it is performed without a craniotomy and accurately mimics the physiological effects of SAH in humans. The long-term behavioural profile of the model, however, has not been characterized. Given that humans often have cognitive deficits following SAH, we set out to characterize the behavioural profile as well as the spontaneous temperature changes of rats following intraluminal perforation. Rats were pre-trained on three motor tasks (tapered beam, limb-use asymmetry and the horizontal ladder tasks) prior to receiving a SAH. The animals were then assessed on post-surgical days 3, 7, 14 and 21 on these tasks. At the completion of motor testing, the rats were assessed on a moving platform version of the Morris water task. Despite significant mortality (33%), SAH did not result in lasting motor deficits on any of the tasks examined. However, the SAH group did show a minor cognitive impairment in the Morris water task. In addition, SAH produced a slight, but significant elevation in body temperature (vs. sham operated rats) despite an acute decrease in general home cage activity. The majority of the animals did not have any observable infarcts and the SAH did not significantly affect cortical thickness. In summary, the endovascular perforation model of SAH results in no lasting motor deficits and only minor cognitive impairment in survivors, which alone would be difficult to evaluate in neuroprotection or rehabilitation studies."
"In recent years, a common approach to understanding how the basal ganglia contribute to learning and memory in humans has been to study the deficits that occur in patients with basal ganglia pathology, such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. Pharmacological manipulations in patients and in healthy volunteers have also been conducted to investigate the role of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is crucial for normal striatal functioning. When combined with powerful functional neuroimaging methods such as positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging, such studies can provide important new insights into striatal function and dysfunction in humans. In this review, we consider this broad literature in an attempt to define a specific role for the caudate nucleus in learning and memory, and in particular, how this role may differ from that of the putamen. We conclude that the caudate nucleus contributes to learning and memory through the excitation of correct action schemas and the selection of appropriate sub-goals based on an evaluation of action-outcomes; both processes that are fundamental to all tasks involve goal-directed action."
"Substance P (SP) has been implicated in learning and memory processes. This peptide facilitated learning when injected peripherally or directly into the ventral pallidum. SP has high affinity for neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptors. WIN51,708 is a potent NK-1 receptor antagonist that can inhibit the physiological effects of SP. Immunohistochemical experiments showed that the globus pallidus (GP) and the amygdaloid (AMY) body are rich in SP immunoreactive elements. Pallidal lesions cause learning deficits in active and passive avoidance paradigms. Serious memory deficits develop after lesions of AMY and its role in conditioned fear has been suggested. The aim of our study was to examine whether the SP microinjected into the GP or central nucleus of AMY (ACE) can modify negative reinforcement. Male Wistar rats were conditioned in a passive avoidance situation. Animals were microinjected with 0.4 microl of 10 ng SP, 100 ng SP or vehicle solution into the GP or the ACE. Results showed that 10 ng SP significantly enhanced passive avoidance learning in both structures, while 100 ng SP was ineffective. Retention examined 1 week later was diminished in the GP and still significant in the ACE. The possible involvement o NK-1 receptors in the effects of SP microinjected into the ACE was also studied. Prior treatment with WIN51,708 could block the SP effects on passive avoidance paradigm. Our results are the first to demonstrate that SP plays important roles, though in different ways, in learning and memory processes related to the GP and AMY."
"Evidence suggests that a promoter polymorphism of the tryptophan-hydroxylase 2 gene (TPH2 -703 G/T) is associated with executive control functions. The current study aimed to clarify whether this relation is restricted to a purely cognitive domain or whether such an effect can also be observed in the processing of emotional material. In a sample of 89 student subjects, a 'cognitive' and an 'emotional' Stroop paradigm were applied to measure processing of cognitive and affective conflicts. Our results suggest an impact of the TPH2 -703 G/T polymorphism on executive control in both, the cognitive as well as the emotional task. In detail, homozygous carriers of the T allele showed decelerated responses in low-conflict conditions, pointing to a rather abnormal functioning of higher-order control mechanisms. Thus, the present investigation is consistent with previous behavioural studies and adds further evidence for the impact of serotonin at the interface of cognition and emotion."
"The rat basolateral amygdala shows neuroanatomical sex differences, continuing development after puberty and aging-related alterations. Implications for amygdala-dependent memory processes were explored here by testing male and female hooded rats in adolescence, adulthood and old age on the food-conditioned place preference task. While aged rats were unimpaired, adolescents failed to learn the task. This finding may be related to ongoing development of the basolateral amygdala and related memory systems during the adolescent period."
"Previous studies have shown that psychological stress affects attentional function, and corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is closely related to stress responses. In the present study, we examined the effect of CRF on attentional function using a five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) in rats. Accuracy in the 5-CSRTT was used as the index of attentional function. Human/rat CRF was intracerebroventricularly injected (0, 0.01, 0.1, or 1 microg/5 microl saline) 20 min before the beginning of the test trial in male Lister hooded rats that generally show high performance in the 5-CSRTT. As a result, 0.1 microg of CRF, but not other doses of CRF, increased accuracy in the 5-CSRTT. However, 0.1 microg of CRF did not affect impulsivity, motivation/appetite, perseverative tendency, or motor function. Even when Wistar rats, which generally show poor performance in the 5-CSRTT were used, 0.1 microg of CRF increased accuracy in the 5-CSRTT. However, the effect of CRF was not significantly attenuated by intracerebroventricular injection of the CRF(1) receptor antagonist antalarmin (5 microg). These results showed that CRF selectively enhances attentional function regardless of baseline attentional performance and rat strain, but this effect may be due to the pathways other than CRF(1) receptors. The present results suggest that CRF is involved in stress-related changes of attention and indicate that moderate stress, but not severe stress, may enhance attentional performance. Furthermore, these findings also indicate that the CRF-related substance could be a target for the development of an agent to improve attentional function."
"Tolerance to the hypophagic effect of psychostimulants is contingent on having access to food while intoxicated. Rats given chronic injections of such drugs with access to food learn to suppress stereotyped movements, which interfere with feeding. In contrast, controls given the drug after food access do not learn to suppress stereotypy and, therefore, do not become tolerant. To determine the role of the basal ganglia in this phenomenon, we used in situ hybridization to measure the expression of c-fos mRNA, a marker for neural activation, in the brains of tolerant and nontolerant rats. Rats given chronic amphetamine injections prior to food access learned to suppress stereotyped movements, whereas yoked controls given the drug after feeding did not. Following an acute injection of amphetamine, both of these groups had higher levels of c-fos mRNA than saline-treated controls throughout the striatum, in the nucleus accumbens core, the ventral pallidum and layers V-VI of the motor cortex. In contrast, tolerant rats, which had learned to suppress stereotypy, had higher levels of c-fos mRNA than both amphetamine- and saline-treated controls in the entopeduncular nucleus, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, pedunculopontine nucleus, nucleus accumbens shell, olfactory tubercle, somatosensory cortex, and layers II-IV of motor cortex. These data suggest that the learned suppression of amphetamine-induced stereotypy involves the activation of dorsal striatal pathways previously implicated in response selection as well as the ventral striatum, long implicated in appetitive motivation and reinforcement."
"In most environmental models of Parkinson's disease (PD), a single neurodegenerative agent is introduced to cause nigrostriatal dopamine depletion. However, cell loss in human PD often might derive, at least in part, from multiple toxins or vulnerabilities, any one of which alone does not inevitably lead to chronic dopamine depletion. In the present research, male C57BL/6J mice were systemically administered the inflammatory bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) alone or in combination and the behavior as well as striatal dopamine levels were compared to saline-treated mice. Mice in the combination (LPS+MPTP) group, but not in the single-factor groups, showed both dopamine depletion and parkinsonian symptoms, i.e., reduced stride length, at 4 months post-injection. MPTP alone acutely reduced striatal dopamine levels but this effect was transient as striatal dopamine recovered to normal levels after time (4 months). The LPS-only group showed no dopamine depletion or reduced stride length. These data are consistent with the view that nigrostriatal dopamine neurons might succumb after time to multiple toxic agents that independently may have only a transient, adverse effect."
"The brains of animals show chemical, anatomical, and functional differences, such as dopamine production and structure of sleep, between Amniota and older groups. In addition, play behavior, capacity to acquire taste aversion, sensory pleasure in decision making, and expression of emotional tachycardia and fever started also to be displayed by Amniota, suggesting that the brain may have began to work differently in early Amniota than in Lissamphibia and earlier vertebrates. Thus we propose that emotion, and more broadly speaking consciousness, emerged in the evolutionary line among the early Amniota. We also propose that consciousness is characterized by a common mental pathway that uses pleasure, or its counterpart displeasure, as a means to optimize behavior."
"The Naples high-excitability (NHE) rats are thought to model the mesocortical variant of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The aim of this study was to investigate forebrain level of L-glutamate, L-aspartate and D-aspartate, in NHE vs. Naples random bred (NRB) control rats. Thus, prepuberal NHE and NRB rats were daily handled in the 5th and 6th week of postnatal life. Then rats were exposed to two spatial novelties i.e. a L&#xe0;t and a Olton maze for 10 min. Amino acids were detected by HPLC in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), striatum (STR), hippocampus (HPC) and hypothalamus (HYP). Results indicate that all amino acids were higher in NHE than in NRB rats. This, in turn, may explain the behavioural hyperactivity and attention deficit of this animal model of ADHD."
"The mesolimbic dopaminergic system that projects from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens is critical for initiation of opioid reinforcement and reward-related effects of drugs of abuse. In the present study, the effects of reversible inactivation of VTA on acquisition and expression of morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) were investigated in rats. One hundred and eighty-one adult male albino Wistar rats were used in these experiments. Reversible inactivation of VTA was done through the unilateral and bilateral intra-VTA microinjection of 2% lidocaine during the acquisition and expression of morphine (5 mg/kg; s.c.)-induced CPP. Animal displacement, conditioning score and locomotor activity were recorded by Ethovision software. The results showed that bilateral but not unilateral intra-VTA administration of lidocaine significantly decreases the acquisition (P&lt;0.01) and expression (P&lt;0.05) of morphine-induced CPP compared to their respective saline-microinjected groups. Moreover, intra-VTA administration of lidocaine had no effect on locomotor activity in these experiments. Our results further support the idea that VTA may play an important role in the acquisition of morphine-induced CPP. In addition, there is no functional lateralization in the VTA for acquisition and/or expression of morphine-induced CPP in the rat."
"Voluntary movement is often perturbed by the external forces in the environment. Because corticospinal (CS) control of wrist muscles during preparation of voluntary movement has been extensively studied without variation in the external forces, very little is known about the way CS control adapts when subjects expect motor perturbations. Here, we studied the CS control of wrist muscles during expectation of an imposed wrist extension. Subjects were instructed either to compensate (COMP) the perturbation (applied at variable delays) or not to intervene (NINT). In a quarter of all trials at random, in the time window when perturbation might occur, TMS was applied over contralateral M1. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were measured in the FCR (flexor carpi radialis) and ECR (extensor carpi radialis) muscles, as well as the silent period (SP) in the FCR. Following the perturbation, we found a larger long-latency stretch reflex in COMP than in NINT. During the expectation of the perturbation, MEP amplitudes did not differ across conditions in FCR. However, those evoked in ECR were greater in COMP than in NINT condition. Moreover in the FCR, the silent period lasted longer in NINT. Thus, we showed a selective effect of the prepared reaction on the anticipatory tuning of CS excitability and cortical inhibition in the agonist/antagonist muscles. This tuning clearly differed from the tuning during voluntary movement preparation without variation in the external forces. This shows that the tuning of the CS system during motor preparation depends on the dynamical context of movement production."
"Individuals in social groups monitor many relationships by adapting their activities to the sex, age, social status, behaviour as well as the position of conspecifics. Here, we investigated the influence of the relative positions of the members of two groups of mangabeys on social visual laterality (right/left) and 'transversality' (frontal/rear) in two contexts: (1) 'one-to-one' interactions and (2) a 'one-to-many' context allowing potential observation of all group members. We discuss our data in relation to (1) the influence of rank and (2) theories explaining lateralization of cerebral hemispheres. First, in 'one-to-one' situations, members of both groups were approached more frequently from their left than from their right, and red-capped mangabeys approached a group member more frequently from their right than from their left. In 'one-to-many' situations, red-capped mangabeys kept more group members in their right than their left frontal visual field. Conversely, the social 'transversality' bias was the same in both contexts: the frontal field was favoured. Second, approach side and relative positions differed according to social rank. Mangabeys that were approached more frequently from their left ranked relatively high. The higher an individual ranked, the more it left other group members behind it; on the contrary dominated mangabeys generally remained below other group members. Thus, social structures, as well as relationships within a group, appear to be good candidates to explain social laterality and 'transversality'."
"Mathematical principles of reinforcement (MPR; Killeen, 1994) is a quantitative model of operant behavior that contains three parameters representing motor capacity (delta), motivation (a), and short term memory (lambda). The present study applied MPR to characterize the effects of bilateral infusions of 6-OHDA into the substantia nigra pars compacta in the rat, a model of Parkinson's disease. Rats were trained to lever press under a 5-component fixed-ratio (5, 15, 30, 60, and 100) schedule of food reinforcement. Rats were tested for 15 days prior to dopamine lesions and again for 15 days post-lesion. To characterize functional loss relative to lesion size, rats were grouped according to the extent and the degree of lateralization of their dopamine loss. Response rates decreased as a function of dopamine depletion, primarily at intermediate ratios. MPR accounted for 98% of variance in pre- and post-lesion response rates. Consistent with reported disruptions in motor behavior induced by dopaminergic lesions, estimates of delta increased when dopamine was severely depleted. There was no support for different estimates of a based on pre- and post-lesion performance of any lesion group, suggesting that dopamine loss has negligible effects on incentive motivation. The present study demonstrates the usefulness of combining operant techniques with a theoretical model to better understand the effects of a neurochemical manipulation."
"Although proprioception consists of static (i.e. position) and dynamic (i.e. movement) components, most studies regarding the matching of proprioceptive targets have focused only on position. Further, these position-matching studies have recently indicated that proprioceptive ability is influenced by several factors including task difficulty and arm preference. The purpose of the present study, therefore, was to quantify the matching of dynamic proprioceptive target arm movements under different matching conditions. Using torque motor-driven manipulanda, 11 blindfolded, right-handed adults experienced triangular velocity profiles at 2 different peak speeds (30 degrees /s or 60 degrees /s) with the preferred and non-preferred elbow. Subjects then matched the dynamics of these target movements with either the same (ipsilateral remembered) or opposite (contralateral remembered) elbow. Matching errors were generally larger for the more difficult, contralateral remembered versus ipsilateral remembered task, and for greater target speed conditions. One arm difference was found indicating a non-preferred arm advantage for the matching of average target acceleration in the ipsilateral remembered condition. Overall, these results demonstrate that dynamic proprioceptive feedback-matching performance is influenced by several factors including peak speed, task difficulty and limb preference."
"It has been demonstrated that altered gravity may lead to impairments in cognitive functions. However, the effect of a combination of hypergravity and weightlessness on cognitive functions is not well understood. In the present study, we report the effects of high sustained hypergravity after 7 days' simulated weightlessness on learning and memory abilities and neuronal apoptosis in rats. In the Y-maze tests, hypergravity (HG) or simulated weightlessness (SW) significantly decreases accuracy, and increases reaction time of rats compared to that of controls. On the contrary, in the passive avoidance test, HG or SW treatment significantly shortens latency and prolongs total time compared to those of controls. In addition, TUNEL staining shows a few apoptotic cells in cortex and hippocampus in the HG, SW and HG+SW groups, and the number of TUNEL positive cells was found to be the most in the HG+SW group. Furthermore, rats with combined HG and SW treatment reveal a synergistic effect in both the Y-maze and the passive avoidance tests, as well as increased neuronal cell death. These findings suggest that simulated weightlessness may exacerbate hypergravity-induced impairment of learning and memory, likely caused by neuronal cell death in rats."
"Activation of sigma-1 receptors (Sig-1R) reportedly has antidepressant-like action. Limited data suggest that Sig-1Rs also modulate anxiety-related behaviors. The present experiments measured depressive-like, anxiety-like and motor behavior in Sig-1R knockout mice and their wildtype littermates. Sig-1R knockout mutants showed increased immobility in the forced swimming test, a depressive-like phenotype, but normal anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze and light/dark box tests and normal locomotor activity. The results further suggest that Sig-1Rs inversely modulate depressive-like behavior."
"In this study, we reproduced two toxic models resembling some motor/kinetic deficits of Huntington's disease induced by bilateral intrastriatal injections of either quinolinic acid (QUIN, 120 nmol/microl per side) or 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP, 250 nmol/microl per side) to rats. Motor skills (including total distance walked/traveled and total horizontal and vertical activities) were evaluated in a box-field system at 1 and 7 days post-lesion. In order to investigate whether these alterations were associated with the oxidative/nitrergic stress evoked by the nitrogen reactive species peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) in the striatum, some rats were pretreated with the ONOO(-) decomposition catalyst iron porphyrinate (Fe(TPPS), 10 mg/kg, i.p.) 120 min prior to toxins infusion. With the aim to further characterize some possible mechanisms by which motor tasks were affected and/or preserved, biochemical analysis of peroxidative damage to lipids and mitochondrial dysfunction were both assessed in synaptic membranes isolated from the striata of QUIN-, 3-NP- and/or Fe(TPPS)-treated animals. Our results show that targeting oxidative/nitrergic stress by Fe(TPPS) in these toxic models results in amelioration of motor deficits linked to inhibition of peroxidative damage and recovery of mitochondrial function in synaptic membranes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the protection exerted by Fe(TPPS) on the biochemical markers analyzed reflects the possible preservation of the functional status of the nerve tissue by limiting the deleterious actions of ONOO(-), further accounting for partial recovery of integrative motor functions."
"Nicotine, a cholinergic agonist, rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier, promotes neuronal plasticity and has been suggested to enhance behavior in a variety of neurological conditions. Nicotine has also been suggested to benefit functional recovery in rodent models of stroke. At present there has been no systematic investigation of the potential benefits of nicotine therapy in both the acute and chronic post-stroke period. This was the objective of the present study and to that end, the effects of nicotine administration prior to and following motor cortex stroke were examined in a skilled reaching task. The task provides a thorough assessment of learned nonuse and constraint-induced recovery of behavior as determined by both end-point and movement element analysis. Nicotine (0.3 mg/kg p.o.) was administered twice daily during reach training and following motor cortex stroke. Rats were divided into four groups based on their pre-/post-stroke treatment: nicotine/nicotine, nicotine/vehicle, vehicle/nicotine, vehicle/vehicle. After stroke, nicotine did not counteract learned nonuse, facilitate constraint-induced therapy, or improve long-term recovery as measured by end-point analysis and movement element analysis. The results are discussed in relation to the problem of identifying pharmacotherapeutic agents that augment rehabilitation following stroke."
"Traditionally, animal models of schizophrenia were predominantly pharmacological constructs focused on phenomena linked to dopamine and glutamate neurotransmitter systems, and were created by direct perturbations of these systems. A number of developmental models were subsequently generated that allowed testing of hypotheses about the origin of the disease, mimicked a wider array of clinical and neurobiological features of schizophrenia, and opened new avenues for developing novel treatment strategies. The most thoroughly characterized (approximately 100 primary research articles) is the neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion (NVHL) model, which is the subject of this review. We highlight its advantages and limitations, and how it may offer clues about the extent to which positive, negative, cognitive, and other aspects of schizophrenia, including addiction vulnerability, represent inter-related pathophysiological mechanisms."
"Language dominance has repeatedly been demonstrated by means of functional transcranial Doppler (fTCD) ultrasonography. However, one strongly lateralizing paradigm might be an overestimation of overall language lateralization. We hypothesized that significant differences between hemodynamic patterns could be shown by using multiple language functions (such as productive and receptive tasks). Particularly, we expected more left-hemispheric activity in frontal and productive tasks and we expected less clear left-hemispheric activity in temporal regions and receptive tasks. Thirty healthy volunteers were included in the study. The lateralization index (LI) was measured with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography for each subject during four language tasks: a cued word generation task (WF), a sentence construction task (SENT), a reading task (READ), and a semantic decision task (SEMANT). Left-hemispheric dominance was found in 90%, 80%, 73.3% and 66.7% of the subjects for respectively WF, SENT, READ and SEMANT. A repeated measures analysis of variance revealed significant differences in LIs between the different language tasks (p&lt;.01). Our results showed that productive and syntactic tasks (WF and SENT) lateralize stronger than receptive tasks (READ and SEMANT). The use of a variety of language tasks in the determination of language lateralization therefore appears to be essential in providing a more comprehensive view of language functioning."
"Theta rhythm has been connected to ERP components such as the error-related negativity (ERN) and the feedback-related negativity (FRN). The nature of this theta activity is still unclear, that is, whether it is related to error detection, conflict between responses or reinforcement learning processes. We examined slow (e.g., theta) and fast (e.g., gamma) brain rhythms related to rule violation. A time-frequency decomposition analysis on a wide range of frequencies band (0-95 Hz) indicated that the theta activity relates to evaluation processes, regardless of motor/action processes. Similarities between the theta activities found in rule-violation tasks and in tasks eliciting ERN/FRN suggest that this theta activity reflects the operation of general evaluation mechanisms. Moreover, significant effects were found also in fast brain rhythms. These effects might be related to the synchronization between different types of cognitive processes involving the fulfillment of a task (e.g., working memory, visual perception, mathematical calculation, etc.)."
"Panic attacks present a high comorbidity with agoraphobia, separation anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder. Nevertheless, while panic attacks have been frequently equated to fear, the relationship of panic disorder with specific phobias remains uncertain. The combination of experimental models of panic and phobias could but afford valuable information about both the comorbidity and causation of these disorders. As it regards, while the defensive behaviors produced by stimulation of dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (DPAG) resemble a panic attack, resistance to capture (RC) behaviors that ensue the kindling of the amygdala (AMY) are reminiscent of a phobic reaction. Therefore, this study examined the thresholds of DPAG-evoked panic-like behaviors in rats showing RC behaviors. Rats bearing electrodes in the DPAG and right AMY were subjected to either the full- (Kin-F) or sham- (Kin-S) kindling of AMY. RC behaviors were evaluated throughout both kindling procedures. Thresholds of DPAG-evoked defensive behaviors were recorded before and after the kindling. Moreover, performances of Kin-F and Kin-S rats in the elevated plus-maze were compared to those of intact controls. Data showed that Kin-F and Kin-S rats perform similarly in the elevated plus-maze, thereby making AMY-kindled rats unlikely as a model of generalized anxiety disorder. On the other hand, whereas the RC is characterized by a marked facilitation of natural freezing and flight behaviors, DPAG-evoked freezing (immobility and exophthalmus) and flight (galloping) behaviors were unexpectedly attenuated. Data suggest that RC is mediated by circuits distinct from those of DPAG-evoked defensive behaviors. Consequently, panic and phobic attacks may be mediated by different mechanisms as well."
"Although various emotional behaviors and activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis of rats are induced by the exposure of 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline: TMT, a component of fox odor, these odor-induced responses are influenced by the external environment. Our previous study demonstrated that exposure to green odor, a mixture of cis-3-hexenol and trans-2-hexenal, attenuated stress-induced elevation of the plasma ACTH level in rats. The present study investigated the effect of TMT or green odor on emotional behavior and the HPA axis stress response with or without the influence of environmental novelty. We exposed rats to TMT or green odor in ""familiar"" or ""unfamiliar"" environments and compared the various responses, including fear-related behaviors, non-defensive behaviors and plasma ACTH concentrations. TMT induced enhanced freezing behavior, reduced exploration behavior and elevations in plasma ACTH concentrations in two environmental conditions. Comparing TMT-induced responses in an unfamiliar environment with the familiar environment showed that environmental novelty enhanced TMT-induced fear-related behaviors and elevations of plasma ACTH concentrations. These results revealed that TMT causes fear and stress responses in both familiar and unfamiliar environments, although the novelty of an unfamiliar environment enhances these TMT-induced responses. On the other hand, green odor did not induce any responses in either environment. These findings indicate that odor-induced responses are influenced by the surrounding environment."
"The Renin-angiotensin system, besides blood pressure regulation, affects learning and memory as evidenced by improvement of cognition in hypertensive patients being treated with AT1 receptor blockers like candesartan. The present study examined the influence of candesartan on memory impairment induced by intracerebral streptozotocin (IC STZ 0.5 mg/kg) in mice. Candesartan (0.05 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) was given for 14 days following IC STZ administration. The dose of 0.1 mg/kg significantly improved latency period in passive avoidance test. Further, treatment with 0.1 mg/kg candesartan for 14 days significantly improved spatial memory in mice in water maze test also. In another group, after memory impairment in mice following IC STZ administration, memory improving effect of a 7 days treatment with 0.1 mg/kg candesartan lasted only for 3 subsequent days in water maze task. IC STZ increased oxidative stress but pretreatment with 0.1 mg/kg candesartan decreased oxidative stress as indicated by a decrease in MDA and increase in GSH. Further, candesartan decreased free radicals as evidenced by flow cytometry. IC STZ affected cholinergic system also by increasing acetylcholine esterase activity that was restored by pretreatment with 0.1 mg/kg candesartan. Locomotor activity and serum glucose level remained unaffected by candesartan treatment. These results suggest that AT1 receptors play a facilitatory role in STZ induced memory deficit and corroborate number of human studies that AT1 receptor blockers can be used therapeutically against cognitive decline in hypertensive patients."
"The growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) is strongly expressed in the hypothalamic circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). TGF-alpha is one of several SCN peptides recently suggested to function as a circadian output signal for the regulation of locomotor activity rhythms in nocturnal rodents. When infused in the brain, TGF-alpha suppresses activity. TGF-alpha suppresses other behaviors as well including feeding, resulting in weight loss. Elevated TGF-alpha is correlated with some cancers, and it is possible the TGF-alpha and its receptor, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mediate fatigue and weight loss associated with cancer. If true for cancers outside of the brain, then systemic TGF-alpha should also affect behavior. We tested this hypothesis in hamsters with intraperitoneal injections or week-long subcutaneous infusions of TGF-alpha. Both treatments suppressed activity and infusions caused reduced food consumption and weight loss. To identify areas of the brain that might mediate these effects of systemic TGF-alpha, we used immunohistochemistry to localize cells with an activated MAP kinase signaling pathway (phosphorylated ERK1). Cells were activated in two hypothalamic areas, the paraventricular nucleus and a narrow region surrounding the third ventricle. These sites could not only be targets of TGF-alpha produced in the SCN but could also mediate effects of elevated TGF-alpha from tumors both within and outside the central nervous system."
"Chemical cues are widely used for intraspecific social communication in a vast majority of living organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals. As an example, mammals release olfactory cues with urine that promote neuroendocrine modulations with changes in behavior and physiology in the receiver. In this work, four-month-old Wistar (regular 4-day cyclic) virgin female rats were utilized in the proestrus-to-estrus phase of the reproductive cycle for experimental exposure. In an isolated room, female rats were exposed for 90 min to male-soiled bedding (MSB). Elevated plus-maze assay, open field test, and light/dark box task were performed to analyze behavioral alterations on females after exposure. For biochemical assays, female rats were killed and the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and frontal cortex were isolated for further analysis. Antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase), non-enzymatic antioxidant defense measurements (TRAP and TAR), and the oxidative damage parameters (TBARS, Carbonyl and SH content) were analyzed. In behavioral analyses we observe that female rats show decreased anxiety and locomotory/exploratory activities after MSB exposure. In biochemical assays we observed an increase in both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses in different central nervous system (CNS) structures analyzed 30 and 90 min after MSB exposure. Furthermore, hippocampus and frontal cortex showed diminished free radical oxidative damage at 180 and 240 min after exposure. These results provide the first evidence that oxidative profile of female CNS structures are altered by chemical cues present in the MSB, thus suggesting that pheromonal communication is able to modulate radical oxygen species production and/or clearance in the female brain."
"Chronic anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) treatment during adolescence facilitates offensive aggression in male Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Serotonin (5-HT) modulates aggressive behavior and has been shown to be altered after chronic treatment with AAS. Furthermore, 5-HT type 2 receptors have been implicated in the control of aggression. For example, treatment with 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists suppress the generation of the offensive aggressive phenotype. However, it is unclear whether these receptors are sensitive to adolescent AAS exposure. The current study assessed whether treatment with AAS throughout adolescence influenced the immunohistochemical localization of 5-HT(2A) in areas of the hamster brain implicated in the control of aggression. Hamsters were administered AAS (5.0 mg/kg) each day throughout adolescence, scored for offensive aggression, and then examined for differences in 5-HT(2A)-immunoreactivity (5-HT(2A)-ir). When compared with non-aggressive oil-treated controls, aggressive AAS-treated hamsters showed significant increases in 5-HT(2A)-ir fibers in the lateral portion of the anterior hypothalamus (LAH). Further analysis revealed that AAS treatment also produced a significant increase in the number of cells expressing 5-HT(2A)-ir in the LAH. Together, these results support a role for altered 5-HT(2A) expression and further implicate the LAH as a central brain region important in the control of adolescent AAS-induced offensive aggression."
"Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle reflex has been extensively employed as a test of sensorimotor gating or early attentional control in neuropsychiatric research, because a number of psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, exhibit PPI deficiencies. In both human and animal studies, PPI is commonly demonstrated by an attenuation of the acoustic startle reflex when the startle-inducing pulse stimulus is shortly preceded by a weak non-startling prepulse stimulus. This weakening of the startle reaction is attributed to, and therefore also provides an indirect measure of, the inhibition triggered by the perception of the prepulse stimulus. The relative ease in measuring the overt pulse-elicited startle reaction, in comparison with the relatively weak prepulse-elicited reaction (PPER) has led to a near complete neglect of the latter in recent literature. However, the assumption that the prepulse used in PPI is non-startling, does not imply that it is associated with no measurable responses. In fact the feasibility and reliability of obtaining such measures has been confirmed in both rodents and humans, and here we review the key findings derived from the direct evaluation of prepulse-elicited reaction in PPI, including under conditions that lead to PPI deficits. The theoretical implications and potential interpretative values of PPER are discussed. It is concluded that PPER should no longer be ignored; its emphasis may shed light on the kind of inhibition or gating dysfunction relevant to PPI disruption seen in pathological conditions including schizophrenia."
"5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) is frequently used as a mitotic marker in studies of cell proliferation. Recent studies have reported cytotoxic effects of BrdU on neural progenitor cells in embryonic and neonatal brains in vivo and in adult tissue studied in vitro. The present study was conducted to assess whether BrdU interferes with cell proliferation and neuronal maturation in the rat adult hippocampus in vivo. BrdU effects across a wide range of doses (40-480 mg/kg) on cell proliferation and the population of immature neurons in the adult hippocampus were investigated using immunohistochemical labeling methods for the cell cycle marker Ki67 and a marker for immature neurons, doublecortin. BrdU did not influence cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus or the population of immature neurons observed in the adult hippocampus relative to those observed in saline treated controls. Thus, in contrast with reports of deleterious effects of BrdU in embryonic and neonatal tissue and adult tissue studied in vitro, BrdU does not appear to have cytotoxic effects on proliferating hippocampal cells or immature neurons in vivo in rats."
"Our recent research demonstrates that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signal pathway is impaired in depressed animals, and such disruption is effectively reversed following antidepressant treatment. These results indicate that the ERK pathway may participate in the molecular mechanism of depression. To provide direct evidence for the potential role of the ERK pathway in depression, the present study using a sub-chronic regimen of ERK inhibition investigated the disparate role for the ERK cascade in two specific brain areas, the dorsal hippocampus (dHP) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), in the pathophysiology of depressive-like behavior. Rats were bilaterally implanted with cannulas in the dHP or mPFC and were microinjected with U0126, a specific inhibitor of ERK upstream activator, or vehicle for 7 consecutive days. The behavioral effects of the ERK pathway inhibition were examined in the open field, elevated plus maze, and saccharin preference test. The results showed that the inhibition of the ERK pathway in dHP resulted in anhedonia and anxiety-like behavior, and the ERK pathway inhibition in the mPFC induced anhedonia and locomotor impairment in rats. The phosphorylation of the cyclic AMP-responsive-element-binding protein (CREB) was decreased following the ERK pathway inhibition either in dHP or mPFC. These findings demonstrate that the ERK pathway in either the dHP or mPFC participates in the pathophysiology of the depressive-like behavior, and may have pivotal role in human depression."
"Impairments in different forms of behavioral flexibility, such as set-shifting and reversal learning, are some of the most reliable cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, and have been attributed to a disruption in frontal lobe functioning. However, recent animal studies have highlighted the distinct functional roles that different subcortical systems interconnected with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) play in different forms of behavioral flexibility. This suggests that dysfunction in these circuits also contribute to the cognitive impairments in these processes observed in schizophrenia. The present review summarizes findings from studies that utilize or rodent studies rodents to elucidate the dissociable contributions that prefrontal cortical, striatal, thalamic and dopaminergic systems make to different component processes of behavioral flexibility, with an emphasis on set-shifting functions mediated by the medial PFC. We also review recent work investigating how different manipulations thought to model certain aspects of schizophrenia affect set-shifting and reversal learning. Lastly, we report novel data describing the effects of subchronic ketamine exposure on these forms of flexibility. Ketamine treatment reduced perseverative tendencies during set-shifting, but impaired reversal learning, suggesting a complex disruption of neural circuits related to the nucleus accumbens shell and orbitofrontal cortex. Viewed collectively, these findings further our understanding of how certain neural abnormalities observed in the schizophrenic brain may relate to impairments in behavioral flexibility. This information may facilitate the development of animal models that resemble the complex disruptions in neural circuitry observed in schizophrenia, which would aid in the discovery of novel targeted pharmacotheraputic approaches to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction linked to these circuits."
"The electrophysiological correlates of successful insight and routine problem solving were studied in 12 healthy subjects using high-density event-related potentials (ERPs). Results showed that insight problems elicited a more negative ERP deflection (N300-800) than did routine problems between 300 and 800 ms, and a more negative ERP deflection (N1200-1500) than did routine problems between 1200 and 1500 ms over the fronto-central scalp regions. However, insight problems elicited a more positive ERP deflection (P300-800) than did routine problems between 300 and 800 ms, and a more positive ERP deflection (P1200-1500) than did routine problems between 1200 and 1500 ms over the parieto-occipital scalp regions. Dipole source analysis showed that two dipoles were located in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the parahippocampal gyrus between 300 and 800 ms, and two dipoles were located in the parahippocampal gyrus and the superior frontal gyrus between 1200 and 1500 ms. We discussed the implications of these ERP components in insight problem solving."
"This review describes experiments on the effects of caudate nucleus lesions on behavior in monkeys, cats and rats. Early work on monkeys and cats focused on the relationship of the caudate to the cortex in motor control, leading to the idea that the caudate serves to inhibit behaviors initiated by the cortex. However, investigation of this hypothesis with systematic behavioral testing in all three species did not support this idea; rather, these studies provided evidence that caudate lesions affect memory functions. Two main types of memory tasks were affected. One type involved reinforced stimulus-response (S-R) associations, the other involved spatial information, response-reinforcer contingencies, or working memory. Recent evidence, mainly from rats, suggests that the dorsolateral part of the caudoputamen is central to the processing and consolidation of memory for reinforced S-R associations, and that the more medial and anterior parts of the same structure are part of a neural circuit that (in some cases) also includes the hippocampus, and mediates relational information and certain forms of working memory. The possibility that the spatial distribution of the patch and matrix compartments within the caudoputamen underlies these regional differences is discussed."
"Spatial-attentional deficits are highly prevalent following stroke. They can be clinically detected by means of conventional bedside tests such as target cancellation, line bisection and the visual extinction test. Until recently, lesion mapping studies and functional imaging of the intact brain did not agree very well on exactly which parietal areas play a key role in selective attention: the inferior parietal lobule or the intraparietal sulcus. Recently, the use of a contrastive approach in patients akin to that commonly used in functional imaging studies in healthy volunteers together with voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping have allowed to bring the patient lesion mapping much closer to the functional imaging results obtained in healthy controls. In this review we focus on converging evidence obtained from patient lesion studies and from fMRI studies in the intact brain in humans. This has yielded novel insights into the functional segregation between the middle third of the intraparietal sulcus, the superior parietal lobule and the temporoparietal junction in the intact brain and also enhanced our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying deficits arising in patients."
"Female zebra finches display a preference for songs of males raised with tutors compared to those from males without tutors. To determine how this behavioral preference may be mediated by auditory perception sites, the social behavior network, and the dopamine reward system, and whether responses of these regions are affected by estradiol, females were treated with hormone or blank implants. An auditory choice test was conducted followed by exposure to tutored or untutored song or silence to examine induction of the immediate early gene, ZENK. Birds spent significantly more time near tutored than untutored song, regardless of estrogen treatment, and estradiol significantly decreased the density of ZENK immunoreactive neurons within the ventromedial hypothalamus. These results suggest that selective neural and behavioral responses can be induced by both high quality vocalizations and estradiol, although they are not necessarily correlated."
"Functional sensorimotor recovery after transplantation of mesencephalic dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons has been well documented in the rat 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of Parkinson's disease. However, the functional restoration of more specific gait-related patterns such as skilled walking, balance, and individual limb movements have been insufficiently studied. The purpose of this study was to investigate the behavioural effects of intrastriatal DA grafts on different aspects of normal and skilled walking in rats following unilateral 6-OHDA lesions of the medial forebrain bundle. Rats were subjected to drug-induced rotation, detailed footprint analysis, and assessment of skilled walking in the ladder rung walking test prior and after the transplantation of E14 ventral mesencephalon-derived progenitor cells. Good DAergic graft survival, as revealed by immunohistochemistry, was accompanied by a compensation of drug-induced rotational asymmetries. Interestingly, the analysis of walking patterns displayed a heterogeneous graft-induced response in skilled and non-skilled limb use. Grafted animals made fewer errors with their contralateral limbs in skilled walking than the sham-transplanted rats, and they improved their ipsi- and contralateral limb rotation. However, the parameter distance between feet showed a delayed recovery, and the stride length was not affected by the DA grafts at all. These findings indicate that ectopic intrastriatal transplantation of E14 ventral mesencephalon-derived cells promotes recovery of gait balance and stability, but does not ameliorate the shuffling gait pattern associated with 6-OHDA lesions. A full restoration of locomotor gait pattern might require a more complete and organotypic reconstruction of the mesotelencephalic DAergic pathway."
"Although the sounds/p/and/k/are both voiceless plosives, they have different places of articulation: bilabial and velar, respectively. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship among articulators in plosives with reference to their place of articulation. Ten healthy subjects repeated bilabial and velar plosives in synchronization with magnetic resonance scanning. Each run was measured using a gradient echo sequence. Several linear and angular variables were defined to delineate the individual movements of articulators and to determine the temporal relationships among articulators. These variables showed distinctive changes depending on the place of articulation. In addition, movement of the velum was significantly correlated with that of the lips and the anterior part of the tongue in the bilabial plosive and with the posterior part of the tongue in the velar plosive. We conclude that unitary motor coordination of articulators depends on the place of articulation."
"This study was designed to assess the effect of the phytoestrogenic compound ferutinin, chronically administered in ovariectomized progesterone primed rats, alone or in combination with estradiol benzoate. After 2, 3 and 4 weeks of treatments, female rats were tested for receptive (lordosis) and proceptive behaviors (hops, darts and ear wigglings). Ferutinin given alone markedly increased the intensity of the lordotic response in ovariectomized rats but failed to significantly affect proceptivity. On the other hand estradiol benzoate significantly increased both receptive and proceptive behaviors. When administered in combination with estradiol, ferutinin reduced the increase in receptivity and proceptivity due to estrogen effects, acting as an antiestrogen. At the end of the behavioral experiments, animals were sacrificed and Western blot analysis of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) levels was performed in the dissected hypothalami. Ferutinin increased ERalpha expression when administered alone, as estradiol did, but decreased the response to estradiol when administered in combination. These results suggest that ferutinin displays estrogenic or antiestrogenic activity through ERalpha in the hypothalamus, depending on the absence or the presence of estrogen priming."
"Histamine was intensively studied at the beginning of the 20th century because of its important role in allergic and inflammation processes. In those days it was very difficult that researchers could envisage another impacting function for the imidazolamine in the living systems. Once the imidazolamine was found located in neuron compartment in the brain, increasing evidence supported many regulatory functions including its possible role in memory and learning. The specific participation of histamine in cognitive functions followed a slow and unclear pathway because the many different experimental learning models, pharmacologic approaches, systemic and localized applications of the histamine active compounds into the brain used by researchers showed facilitating or inhibitory effects on learning, generating an active issue that has extended up to present time. In this review, all these aspects are analyzed and discussed considering the many intracellular different mechanisms discovered for histamine, the specific histamine receptors and the compartmentalizing proprieties of the brain that might explain the apparent inconsistent effects of the imidazolamine in learning. In addition, a hypothetical physiologic role for histamine in memory is proposed under the standard theories of learning in experimental animals and humans."
"The present series of studies provide validation of a new paradigm that uniquely combines the assessment of the propensity to engage in social investigation with measures of (nonsocial) exploratory activity in rats. Assessment of this social investigation paradigm indicated that (a) rats showed a robust preference for social investigation over nonsocial exploratory activity, (b) female rats showed a greater preference for social investigation than male rats, (c) no signs of habituation in these responses were observed when rats were tested once daily for 4 consecutive days, (d) the preference for social investigation was stable and robust in both the dark and light periods of the daily light cycle for 5 consecutive days, and (e) testing under bright light conditions suppressed social investigation. In addition, acute administration of opiate drugs, low dose morphine (1.0 mg/kg) and naltrexone (1.0 mg/kg) produced a more robust attenuation of social investigation than nonsocial exploratory activity. Amphetamine increased both forms of investigation and haloperidol had the opposite effect, but the overall preference for social investigation over exploratory activity remained largely intact after both amphetamine and haloperidol injection. Together, these findings validate the use of this behavioral task to assess changes in social-motivation and general exploratory activity. Importantly, the task is bi-directionally sensitive to subject characteristics (i.e., sex), drug manipulations which modulate social motivation, and environmental manipulations."
"The FGL peptide is a neural cell adhesion molecule-derived fibroblast growth factor receptor agonist. FGL has both neurotrophic and memory enhancing properties. Neonatal phencyclidine (PCP) treatment on postnatal days 7, 9, and 11 has been shown to result in long-lasting behavioral abnormalities, including cognitive impairment relevant to schizophrenia. The present study investigated the effect of FGL on spatial learning and memory deficits induced by neonatal PCP treatment. Rat pups were treated with 30 mg/kg PCP on postnatal days 7, 9, and 11. Additionally, the rats were subjected to a chronic FGL treatment regimen where FGL was administered throughout development. Rats were tested as adults for spatial reference memory, reversal learning, and working memory in the Morris water maze. The PCP-treated rats demonstrated a robust impairment in working memory and reversal learning. However, the long-term memory component of the reference memory task was not affected by PCP. Chronic FGL treatment had no effect on the reversal learning impairment but ameliorated the working memory deficits almost to the levels of the control groups. In conclusion, the results suggest that the neonatal PCP treatment produced deficits in cognition relevant to schizophrenia. Moreover, working memory function was selectively protected by the neurotrophic peptide, FGL."
"The plus-maze apparatus figured prominently in the historical debate between cognitive and stimulus-response habit learning theorists concerned with the fundamental question of ""what"" animals learn. An important feature of this task is that variants of the training procedure can be arranged to allow for an assessment of the relative use of cognitive/place or habit/response learning mechanisms. This brief review describes findings from several neurobiological studies published primarily over the past decade that have re-introduced the plus-maze to investigate the role of the dorsal striatum in learning and memory. Converging evidence from research using brain lesion, pharmacological, and molecular/genetic approaches is described supporting the hypothesis that the dorsolateral striatum plays a selective role in response learning in the plus-maze. Within a multiple systems framework of memory organization, factors that can influence the relative use of place and response learning in the plus-maze are also considered, including the nature of the visual environment, reinforcement/training parameters, and emotional state of the organism. Response learning in the plus-maze may be considered an exemplar task useful for investigating the neurobiological bases of dorsal striatal involvement in habit learning and memory. This mnemonic function of the dorsal striatum generalizes across several sensory modalities and mammalian species, including humans."
"While midbrain DA neurons show phasic activations in response to both reward-predicting and salient non-reward events, activation responses to primary and conditioned rewards are sustained for several hundreds of milliseconds beyond those elicited by salient non-reward-related stimuli. The longer-duration DA reward response and corresponding elevated DA release in striatal target sites may selectively strengthen currently-active corticostriatal synapses, i.e., those associated with the successful reward-procuring behavior. This paper describes how similar models of DA-mediated plasticity of corticostriatal synapses may describe both stimulus-response and response-outcome learning. DA-mediated strengthening of corticostriatal synapses in regions of the dorsolateral striatum receiving afferents from primary sensorimotor cortex is likely to bind corticostriatal inputs representing the previously-emitted movement to striatal outputs contributing to the selection of the next movement segment in a behavioral sequence. Within the striatum, more generally, inputs from distinct regions of the frontal cortex that code independently for movement direction and reward expectation send convergent projections to striatal output cells. DA-mediated strengthening of active corticostriatal synapses promotes the future output of the striatal cell under similar input conditions. This is postulated to promote persistence of neuronal activity in the very cortical cells that drive corticostriatal input, leading to the establishment of sustained reverberatory loops that permit cortical movement-related cells to maintain activity until the appropriate time of movement initiation."
"Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle response is a valuable paradigm for sensorimotor gating processes. Previous research showed that acute administration of St. John's wort extract (500 mg/kg, p.o.) to rats caused significant disruption of PPI while elevating monoamines levels in some brain areas. The cause-effect relationship between extract-induced PPI disruption and augmented monoaminergic transmission was studied using different serotoninergic, adrenergic and dopaminergic antagonists. The effects of hypericin and hyperforin, as the main active constituents of the extract, on PPI response were also tested. PPI disruption was prevented after blocking the serotoninergic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A, alpha-adrenergic and dopaminergic D1 receptors. Results also demonstrated a significant PPI deficit after acute treatment of rats with hyperforin, and not hypericin. In some conditions manifesting disrupted PPI response, apoptosis coexists. Electrophoresis of DNA isolated from brains of hyperforin-treated animals revealed absence of any abnormal DNA fragmentation patterns. It is concluded that serotoninergic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A, alpha-adrenergic and dopaminergic D1 receptors are involved in the disruptive effect of St. John's wort extract on PPI response in rats. We can also conclude that hyperforin, and not hypericin, is one of the active ingredients responsible for St. John's wort-induced PPI disruption with no relation to apoptotic processes."
"There is increasing evidence of immune involvement in both schizophrenia and autism. Of particular interest are striking abnormalities in the expression of immune-related molecules such as cytokines in the brain and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). It is proposed that this represents a permanent state of brain immune dysregulation, which begins during early development. One possibility is that maternal infection, a known risk factor for schizophrenia and autism, sets this immune activation in motion. Several animal models are being used to investigate this hypothesis. There is also recent evidence that, among schizophrenic subjects, those associated with maternal infection display a distinctive pathology, which suggests that diverse causes for this disorder may explain some of its heterogeneity. The human and animal results related to immune involvement suggest novel therapeutic avenues based on immune interventions."
"The aim of this review is to show how olfaction is a sensory modality of singular importance for the fine adjustment of early mother-infant interactions. While the precise role of maternal olfaction varies from one species to another, olfactory cues are in fact used in various aspects of parental care. Not only do infantile odors become very potent stimuli allowing the normal development of maternal care but they also provide a basis for individual recognition of the offspring in some species. Recognizable olfactory signatures reflected the product of individual's genotype and are also influenced by the environment. Highly specialized neural mechanisms for processing of the infant signals have been developed. While there is no functional specificity of either the main or the accessory olfactory systems in the onset of maternal behavior among species, only the main olfactory system is implicated when individual odor discrimination of the young is required. Neural structures, such as the main olfactory bulb, undergo profound changes when exposed to offspring odors at parturition. These changes in synaptic circuitry contribute both to maternal responsiveness to these odors and to their memorization."
"The CatWalk gait analysis system has recently been suggested as a rapid and objective alternative method over the von Frey test to assess mechanical allodynia in chronic neuropathic pain models. Our results demonstrate that no correlation exists between the development of mechanical allodynia and changes in CatWalk-gait parameters in a chronic inflammatory pain model. Hence, the use of the CatWalk in assessment of experimental chronic pain is discussed."
"Many species that engage in parental behavior exhibit infanticide under certain circumstances. The neural signals regulating the transition from infant care giver to infant killer and back remain unclear. Previously we demonstrated that progesterone (P) and its receptor (PR) have inhibitory effects on parental behavior and increase infant-directed aggression in male mice. In the present studies we sought to elucidate the mechanisms by which the effects of P are manifested. Because the onset of parental behavior in females is associated with the withdrawal of P at the end of pregnancy we tested the hypothesis that withdrawal of P would similarly enhance parental behavior in males. Virgin male mice were implanted with P or vehicle for 21 days, replicating the duration of pregnancy in females. Tests were run for parental and infanticidal behavior 5 days after removal of the capsules. P increased the proportion of nonparental males that attacked pups. However, neither the number of males exhibiting parental care nor the quality of care was affected by P treatment. Serum P and testosterone (T) levels were not different from controls at the time of behavioral testing indicating continued elevations in peripheral hormones are not required for the expression of infanticide. In conclusion, withdrawal of P does not trigger the onset of parental behavior in males. Rather, prior exposure to P induces persistent infanticidal behavior in adult male mice."
"Scents play key roles in mediating sexual behaviour in many vertebrates, both in the recognition of opposite sex conspecifics and in assessing the suitability of different individuals as potential mates. The recognition and assessment that underlies female attraction to male scents involves an important interaction between the main and accessory (vomeronasal) olfactory systems. Female mice gain information through the vomeronasal system on nasal contact with a scent source that is essential to stimulate attraction to an individual male's scent. Three highly polymorphic multigene families contribute involatile proteins and peptides to mouse scents that are detected through specific vomeronasal receptors during contact with scent. Major urinary proteins (MUPs) provide an individual genetic identity signature that underlies individual recognition and assessment of male competitive ability, kin recognition to avoid inbreeding, and genetic heterozygosity assessment. Familiar mates are recognised in the context of pregnancy block using MHC peptides, while exocrine-gland secreting peptides (ESPs) are likely to play additional roles in sexual assessment. By associating this involatile information in individual male scents, gained on initial scent contact, with the individual male's airborne volatile signature detected simultaneously through the main olfactory system, females subsequently recognise and are attracted by the individual male's airborne volatile signature alone. This allows much more rapid recognition of scents from familiar animals without requiring physical contact or processing through the vomeronasal system. Nonetheless, key information that induces attraction to a male's scent is held in involatile components detected through the vomeronasal system, allowing assessment of the genetic identity and attractiveness of each individual male."
"There is increasing evidence for specialised processing of social cues in the brain. This review considers how the main olfactory system of mammals is designed to process social odours and the effects of learning in a social context. It focuses mainly on extensive research carried out on offspring, mate or conspecific learning carried out in sheep and rodents. Detailing the roles of the olfactory bulb and its projections, classical neurotransmitters, nitric oxide, oestrogen and neuropeptides such as oxytocin and vasopressin in mediating plasticity changes in the olfactory system arising from these different social learning contexts. The relative simplicity of the organisation of the olfactory system, the speed and robustness of these forms of social learning together with the similarity in brain regions and neurochemical contributions across the different learning paradigms make them important and useful models for investigating general principles of learning and memory in the brain."
"Maternal infection during pregnancy is a notable risk factor for the offspring to develop severe neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. One prevalent hypothesis suggests that infection-induced disruption of early prenatal brain development predisposes the organism for long-lasting structural and functional brain abnormalities, leading to the emergence of psychopathological behaviour in adulthood. The feasibility of this causal link has received considerable support from several experimental models established in both rats and mice. In this review, we provide an integrative summary of the long-term neuropathological consequences of prenatal exposure to infection and/or inflammation as identified in various experimental models of prenatal immune challenge. In addition, we highlight how abnormalities in distinct brain areas and neurotransmitter systems following prenatal immune activation may provide a neural basis for the emergence of specific forms of psychosis-related behaviour. Specifically, we suggest that prenatal infection-induced imbalances in the mesolimibic and mesocortical dopamine pathways may constitute critical neural mechanisms for disturbances in sensorimotor gating, abnormalities in selective associative learning and hypersensitivity to psychostimulant drugs. On the other hand, the emergence of working memory deficiency following prenatal immune challenge may be crucially linked to the concomitant disruption of GABAergic and glutamatergic functions in prefrontal cortical and hippocampal structures. Notably, many of the identified neuronal abnormalities are directly implicated in the neuropathology of schizophrenia. The findings from prenatal infection models of schizophrenia thus provide considerable experimental evidence for the assumption that prenatal exposure to infection and/or inflammation is a relevant environmental link to specific neuronal abnormalities underlying psychosis-related behaviour in humans."
"The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is important for the ability of motivationally significant stimuli to guide behavior. To further delineate its role in appetitive Pavlovian conditioning, we tested the hypothesis that the NAc contributes to memory consolidation and expression for a goal-tracking version of Pavlovian conditioned approach (PCA) in rats. We found that neither post-training reversible inactivation with the GABA receptor agonists muscimol and baclofen nor inhibition of protein synthesis with anisomycin (ANI) in either the core or shell regions of the NAc had an effect on approach to a reward port in response to a reward-predictive cue (conditioned stimulus, CS+). In contrast, pre-test reversible inactivation of both the core and shell decreased conditioned responding during the CS+. Unlike inactivation of the core, however, reversible inactivation of the shell also produced an increase in responding during the CS- and the inter-trial interval. This suggests that the NAc is not involved in the consolidation of goal-tracking PCA, but that once the memory is formed, the core is required for expression of the CS-unconditioned stimulus (US) association and the shell is required to inhibit conditioned approach behavior at times when the CS+ is not presented."
"To investigate the cortical activity pattern associated with the exploration and identification of a novel object we recorded the intracranial electrocorticogram (ECoG) in the barrel cortex of freely moving adult rats using wireless technology. We report here that the exploration and detection of a novel object correlate with a transient increase of synchronized oscillatory activity in the 40-47 Hz frequency band. This specific cortical activity pattern occurs 200-300 ms after the first sensory contact with the novel stimulus and decreases in power in the subsequent recording sessions with the same object. During the first explorative session the increase in 40-47 Hz is associated with a simultaneous decrease in the 30-37 Hz band, which increased to a stable level already after one session. Our results indicate that synchronized gamma activities in primary sensory cortex may represent the neuronal signature for the detection of a novel object."
"Releasers of innate responses are more effective in many vertebrates when seen by the left eye. In zebrafish Brachydanio rerio, this asymmetry is linked with neuroanatomical asymmetry of the habenular complex (enlarged left lateral and right medial habenular nuclei): if habenular asymmetry is reversed, reader response to releasers shifts to the right eye. Light exposure (schedule: 14/10h,L/D) during the first few days of development post fertilisation (pf) controls the patterning of this asymmetry. We show here, using response to a model predator on day 7 pf, that absence of light on day 1 pf alone causes high responsiveness to shift from left to right eye and to intensify. Absence on day 2 pf or day 3 pf produces lesser shifts, whereas absence for all 3 days reduces responsiveness without any shift. Action on day 1 pf is likely to be due to modulation of gene expression. A known disturbance of gene (nrp1a) expression causes rerouting of the outflow of the left lateral habenula to the way station of the right medial habenula, providing a possible explanation of shifts. Variation in exposure of eggs to light is likely to produce inter-individual variation in the field."
"In the present study we evaluated the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) system in the antidepressant-like effects of chronic lithium administration in the mouse forced swimming test (FST). Administration of lithium chloride (300 mg/L in drinking water for 21 days) had no effect on the immobility of mice in the FST, whereas 600 mg/L lithium caused a significant (P&lt;0.001) decrease in the immobility time compared with control animals. Administration of the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10mg/kg, daily for a week, i.p.) had no significant effect on the immobility time of either control or lithium (300 mg/L)-treated mice, whereas acute administration of non-effective dose of L-NAME (30 mg/kg, i.p.) caused a robust decrease (P&lt;0.01) in the immobility time of lithium (300 mg/L)-treated animals in the FST. Moreover, chronic administration of low dose of the NO precursor L-arginine (200 mg/kg, daily for a week, i.p.) prevented (P&lt;0.001) the antidepressant-like effects of lithium treatment (600 mg/L) in the FST. Acute treatment with L-arginine (200 mg/kg, i.p.) increased (P&lt;0.05) the immobility time of lithium (600 mg/L)-treated mice in the FST. Chronic lithium treatment (600 mg/L but not 300 mg/L) caused a significant (P&lt;0.05) decrease in the serum NO(X) levels in mice compared with controls. Our data suggested that the NO system could be involved in the antidepressant-like effect of chronic lithium treatment in the FST."
"Significant similarities exist between the neural and behavioural features of environmentally and drug-induced stereotypy. For example, exposure to dopamine agonists, such as amphetamine, induces stereotypy and causes alterations in midbrain neurophysiology similar to those observed following chronic stress. An additional behavioural feature of these neural changes in the drug-induced phenotype is an enhanced rate of switching from response-outcome (R-O) to stimulus-response (S-R) learning. The aim of the current experiment was to examine R-O and S-R learning in horses displaying environmentally induced oral stereotypies. This was achieved by employing variations of the place/response paradigm. In Experiment 1, we found that crib-biting horses displayed 'response' learning after 20 learning trials, whereas non-crib-biting controls tended to display 'place' learning throughout the experiment. In Experiment 2, we used a modified version of the procedure, in which the subjects were introduced to the maze from different start points and forced always to turn the same way. We found that the crib-biters acquired the task at a faster rate suggesting again that this group was displaying 'response' learning. Finally, in Experiment 3, we carried out an arena test to ensure that crib-biters were capable of 'place' learning. These results are the first to show that horses displaying an oral stereotypy, a behavioural phenotype previously associated with stress-induced perturbations of the basal ganglia, preferentially use 'response' learning. The findings are discussed in relation to the search for an aetiological model of stereotypy."
"The striatal dopamine signal has multiple facets; tonic level, phasic rise and fall, and variation of the phasic rise/fall depending on the expectation of reward/punishment. We have developed a network model of the striatal direct pathway using an ionic current level model of the medium spiny neuron that incorporates currents sensitive to changes in the tonic level of dopamine. The model neurons in the network learn action selection based on a novel set of mathematical rules that incorporate the phasic change in the dopamine signal. This network model is capable of learning to perform a sequence learning task that in humans is thought to be dependent on the basal ganglia. When both tonic and phasic levels of dopamine are decreased, as would be expected in unmedicated Parkinson's disease (PD), the model reproduces the deficits seen in a human PD group off medication. When the tonic level is increased to normal, but with reduced phasic increases and decreases in response to reward and punishment, respectively, as would be expected in PD medicated with L-Dopa, the model again reproduces the human data. These findings support the view that the cognitive dysfunctions seen in Parkinson's disease are not solely either due to the decreased tonic level of dopamine or to the decreased responsiveness of the phasic dopamine signal to reward and punishment, but to a combination of the two factors that varies dependent on disease stage and medication status."
"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of antioxidant ingestion on stress-induced impairment of cognitive memory. Male C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups as follows: (1) control mice (C mice) fed in a normal cage without immobilization; (2) restraint-stressed (RS mice) fed in a small cage; (3) vitamin E mice (VE mice), mice were fed in a small cage with a diet supplemented with vitamin E; (4) GliSODin mice (GS mice) fed in a small cage with a diet supplemented with GliSODin. RS, VE and GS mice were exposed to 12 h of immobilization daily. Five weeks later, spatial learning was measured using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test. After water maze testing, we performed immunohistochemical analysis using 4-hydroxy-2-noneral (4-HNE) and an anti-Ki67 antibody. 4-HNE is a marker of lipid peroxidation. RS mice showed impaired spatial learning performance and an increased number of 4-HNE-positive cells in the granule cell layer (GCL) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus when compared to C mice. Moreover, RS mice showed a decreased number of Ki67-positive cells in the subgranular zone (SGZ). GS mice showed better spatial learning memory than RS mice. The number of 4-HNE-positive cells in the GCL of GS mice was significantly less than that of RS mice. The number of Ki67-positive cells in the SGZ of GS mice was significantly greater than that of RS mice. These finding suggests that GliSODin prevents stress-induced impairment of cognitive function and maintains neurogenesis in the hippocampus through antioxidant activity."
"Animal models of anxiety have usually employed nocturnal species (e.g. rats and mice), and the tests used have been almost exclusively performed during the diurnal phase (lights on). Here, for the first time, we tested anxiety in a diurnal rodent, Octodon degus, according to its age (23 versus 40 months of age) and the time of the day. We employed three anxiety tests: object recognition, open field and light-dark tests, which were applied in the morning, at mid-day and in the late afternoon, respectively. Adult animals spent more time exploring a new object than aged animals. Nevertheless, there were no differences in the frequency of object exploration or in the latency to the first object approach between the groups. In the open field test, adult animals spent more time exploring (ambulation and rearing) than aged ones. Although both groups exhibited similar frequencies in transition from the dark to the light box in the light-dark test, adult animals spent significantly more time in the light, and expressed less anxiety when making the decision to cross over from the dark into the light area. In conclusion, there were no differences in anxiety between adult and aged animals in the morning session, although adult animals were more attentive when exploring a new object. However, in the mid-day and afternoon testing sessions, aged animals were more anxious than adults."
"Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder generally considered to encompass positive symptoms, negative symptoms and cognitive deficits. Increasing attention has been paid to the social cognitive deficits of the disorder as these dysfunctions are particularly handicapping, predictive of functional outcome and show poor treatment response. Phencyclidine (PCP) is a psychotomimetic drug used to model the different aspects of schizophrenia in experimental animal models. PCP-induced cognitive deficits and hyperlocomotion may be blocked by pretreatment with nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors in rodents. The present study was carried out to evaluate the acute effects of PCP and NO synthase inhibition on social interaction in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The NO synthase inhibitor, L-NAME (10mg/kg) and PCP (2mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously to rats, which were then tested in pairs for social interactive behaviour. Twenty-four hours after the initial test a drug-free social interaction test was carried out to assess the rats' memory of the previous social interaction. The results showed that PCP reduced the time of social interaction on Day 1 compared to controls, and that pretreatment with the NO synthase inhibitor, L-NAME, attenuated this reduction towards control levels. Neither locomotor activity, nor frequency of social interactions were affected by the PCP treatment, suggesting that the PCP-induced effects observed were not due to drug-induced stereotypies. In combination with increasing clinical evidence for the involvement of NO in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, the present results indicate that NO synthase inhibition may be a potentially new treatment strategy for alleviating social dysfunction in schizophrenia."
"Acute exposure to the predator odor trimethylthiazoline (TMT) induces defensive behavior in the male rat, and this response is associated with a decrease in cell proliferation within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Sexual experience appears to be protective, as it exerts anxiolytic-like effects and sustains gonadal function in the face of stress. To examine the influence of sexual experience on subsequent stress-induced defensive behavior and cell proliferation in the hippocampus we exposed adult male rats to TMT odor with or without prior exposure to sexually receptive female rats. A subset of rats was injected with the DNA-synthesis marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; 200 mg/kg) during TMT exposure and perfused 24 h later to provide an index of cell proliferation within the dentate gyrus. In response to TMT, sexual experience reduced the duration of stretched attend postures, but had no significant effect on defensive burying. Furthermore, TMT induced a significant increase in cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus, but only in males with sexual experience. The results demonstrate an influence of socio-sexual experience on the magnitude of the behavioral and neural responses to predator odor stress."
"The opioid system has been implicated in major depression and in the mechanism of action of antidepressants. This study investigated the involvement of the opioid system in the antidepressant-like effect of the water-soluble B-vitamin folic acid in the forced swimming test (FST). The effect of folic acid (10 nmol/site, i.c.v.) was prevented by the pretreatment of mice with naloxone (1 mg/kg, i.p., a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist), naltrindole (3 mg/kg, i.p., a selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist), naloxonazine (10 mg/kg, i.p., a selective mu(1)-opioid receptor antagonist, 24 h before), but not with naloxone methiodide (1 mg/kg, s.c., a peripherally acting opioid receptor antagonist). In addition, a sub-effective dose of folic acid (1 nmol/site, i.c.v.) produced a synergistic antidepressant-like effect in the FST with a sub-effective dose of morphine (1 mg/kg, s.c.). A further approach was designed to investigate the possible relationship between the opioid system and NMDA receptors in the mechanism of action of folic acid in the FST. Pretreatment of the animals with naloxone (1 mg/kg, i.p.) prevented the synergistic antidepressant-like effect of folic acid (1 nmol/site, i.c.v.) and MK-801 (0.001 mg/kg, i.p., a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist). Together the results firstly indicate that the anti-immobility effect of folic acid in the FST is mediated by an interaction with the opioid system (mu(1) and delta), likely dependent on the inhibition of NMDA receptors elicited by folic acid."
"Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is constitutively expressed in neurons of the hippocampus and neocortex. Therefore, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) targeting inflammation-induced COX-2 in the periphery and the central nervous system may also affect cognitive function mediated by basal COX-2 activity. We report that systemic administration of the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 6h prior to behavioral assessment does not influence spatial acquisition or retention in male C57BL/6J mice. However, we observed impaired spatial retention in female mice treated with NS-398, suggesting a sex-dependent role of COX-2 in spatial memory of mice."
"Impulsivity, a core symptom of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is tested in animal models by delay-discounting tasks. So far, mainly male subjects have been used in this paradigm at severe levels of food restriction. Here we studied the impulsive behaviour of CD-1 adult male and female mice at mild levels of food restriction. Mice maintained at 90 +/- 5% of ad libitum bodyweight, were tested in operant chambers provided with nose-poking holes. Nose poking in one hole resulted in the immediate delivery of one food pellet (small-soon, SS), whereas nose poking in the other hole delivered five food pellets after a delay (large-late, LL), which was increased progressively each day (0-150 s). Two subgroups emerged: individuals that shifted at short delays (""steep"") and individuals that did not shift, even at the highest delays (""flat""). Analysis showed that ""steep"" females shifted at shorter delays than ""steep"" males, while no difference existed between males and females within the ""flat"" sub-population. In home-cage circadian activity as well as in a novelty-seeking test, females were more active than males. It can be concluded from these results that female mice are more impulsive than male mice under mild food restriction. This is in contrast with findings in earlier studies with more severe food restriction. Therefore, an alternative explanation is that females are more explorative, and that different features might be tested in delay-discounting paradigms, depending on restriction levels."
"In the burrowing test, mice or rats spontaneously empty a tube filled with food pellets, gravel or other substances. The test is extremely simple to perform, the apparatus is inexpensive and readily constructed. It exploits a natural rodent behaviour, provides quantitative data under controlled laboratory conditions, and has proved extremely sensitive to prion disease in mice (Mus musculus), cytokines in rats (Rattus norvegicus), lipopolysaccharide in mice and rats, strain differences and brain lesions in mice. However, it has not been used in other, less common, laboratory species, and might, e.g. be useful in detecting scrapie infection in hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), a commonly used species in prion disease research. Therefore, the present study systematically investigated burrowing behaviour in five rodent species, using five different burrowing substrates. It also enquired whether rats are unique among rodents in showing little burrowing of food pellets, yet burrow gravel and other earth-like substrates vigorously. The results showed that all the species (rats, mice, hamsters and gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus)), except one (Egyptian spiny mice, Acomys cahirinus, which does not dig burrows in the wild) burrowed earth-like substrates well. However, laboratory mice were the only species that burrowed food pellets vigorously, without prior exposure to other substrates. These results show that burrowing, with an appropriate substrate, can be used as a simple behavioural test in many rodent species. It is an excellent detector of neurobehavioural toxicity with applications in many areas of research, especially when long-term behavioural monitoring is required, e.g. to track changes in chronic disease models."
"Levels of prepulse inhibition (PPI) depend on the interval between the startling and prepulse stimuli. Brown Norway rats show less PPI of the acoustic startle response than Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats when the interval between the prepulse and startling stimulus is 100 ms. Central administration of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) decreases PPI at this inter-stimulus interval. Here, the effect of CRF on PPI over a range of inter-stimulus intervals was examined in WKY and BN rats, and in the F1 generation of a cross between them. Rats received an intracerebroventricular infusion of either saline or CRF 30 min prior to testing PPI. Test trials included startle stimulus alone trials, and trials on which a prepulse stimulus of either 6, 12, or 15 dB above background preceded the startling stimulus by either 20, 75, 100, 500 or 2000 ms. CRF decreased PPI in WKY rats at all inter-stimulus intervals and all prepulse intensities, while the effect of CRF on PPI in BN rats only occurred at intermediate intervals. BN and WKY rats showed different levels of PPI only at the intermediate intervals. Baseline PPI in the F1 rats resembled the WKY phenotype. The CRF-induced change in PPI in the F1 generation has some qualities of the effects in each of the progenitor strains. These results suggest that both the effect of rats strain and of CRF on PPI depend on the inter-stimulus interval, and that there is an interaction between prepulse stimulus intensity and the inter-stimulus interval."
"Although changes in emotionality represent common features of post-ischemic recovery in humans, little is known about the effects of global cerebral ischemia on standard behavioral measures of emotionality in rodents. The present study investigated anxiety, locomotor activity, and habituation in test-na&#xef;ve ischemic (subjected to 10 min global ischemia) and sham-operated rats tested 1, 5, 15, and 30 days post-reperfusion in the elevated plus-maze and the open-field. Although rats tested on day 1 post-reperfusion showed increased anxiety relative to sham-operated controls, they demonstrated decreased anxiety on day 5. Anxiety levels were normal on days 15 and 30 following ischemia. Similarly, time-dependent changes in locomotor activity were observed with ischemic rats showing increased activity level on days 1, 5, and 30 post-reperfusion. Surprisingly, locomotor activity was suppressed at day 15. Habituation deficits in the open-field were apparent only on day 1 despite the lack of CA1 neuronal degeneration at this time interval. These findings suggest that both the nature and extent of the effects of global ischemia on behavioral measures of emotionality, locomotion, and habituation in rats are time-dependent."
"The involvement of various neurotransmitter receptors in the brain in the regulation of spatial behavior is a focus of interest for many cognitive neuroscientists. Active allothetic place avoidance (AAPA) task have been demonstrated to require spatial mapping and cognitive coordination and is highly dependent upon hippocampus. The present study was designed to evaluate the role of beta-adrenergic receptors in the modulation of locomotor and spatial behavior in this task. Four doses of centrally active beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (5, 20, 25 and 30 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally 30 min prior to testing in the place avoidance task. Four daily sessions were pursued, each lasting 20 min. A dose of 25 mg/kg was found to induce a deficit in spatial behavior (measured by number of entrances into the shock sector) without altering locomotion; lower doses were without effect. The highest dose (30 mg/kg) impaired both locomotion and avoidance behavior. The results suggest that beta-adrenoceptors are involved in the regulation of behavior in the place avoidance task and that it is possible to dissociate the effect of propranolol on the spatial performance and locomotion in the AAPA using dose-selection."
"We investigated the roles of the hippocampal subregions and intrahippocampal networks in effecting spatial reference and working processes. The results showed that the dentate gyrus plays a key role in encoding both types of spatial memory. Lesions in the dentate gyrus caused severe impairment in the acquisition of the Morris water maze and delayed matching-to-place tasks as compared to those in the other hippocampal subregions (Exp. 1). Further, there was functional cooperation between CA3 and CA1 via the Schaffer collaterals and the hippocampal commissure in the performance of both types of spatial memory tasks. Among the rats with intact hippocampal commissure, those with both contralateral and ipsilateral CA1/CA3 lesions showed a similar performance (Exp. 2A); however, among the rats with transected hippocampal commissure, those with the contralateral CA1/CA3 lesions showed a more disruptive performance than the rats with the ipsilateral CA1/CA3 lesions (Exp. 2B). This study suggests that the hippocampus is the functional unit for spatial reference and working memory processes, including differential functions and functional cooperation among the hippocampal subregions."
"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that, in addition to its essential role in the function of the immune system, is present in the central nervous system (CNS). In particular, pathologically increased CNS IL-6 has been linked to impairments in memory performance. Thus, the aim of our present study was to investigate hippocampus-dependent and -independent memory, in combination with exploratory and anxiety related behaviour in IL-6 knock-out (IL-6KO) mice. The experiments were performed with 9 male IL-6KO and 9 age matched male wild-type (CTRL) mice. Hippocampus-dependent learning was assessed with the Morris water maze (MWM), hippocampus-independent learning with the novel object recognition memory test (NORM). The test-battery for additional behavioural assessments included open field (OF), elevated plus maze (EPM) and forced swim test (FST). IL-6KO mice showed impaired memory processes in the NORM as well in the MWM test. This could not be explained by reduced general activity or increased baseline anxiety. But, there was evidence for a higher susceptibility for stress and reduced exploratory behaviour in IL-6KO mice. In conclusion, absent CNS IL-6 does not lead to an improvement in memory function, but instead to an impairment. As ""too little and too much spoils everything"", our findings do not contradict the hypothesis of an involvement of IL-6 in memory processes. However, it remains unclear if impairments of memory are a specific result of disturbed IL-6 signalling, or rather an epiphenomenon associated with reduced exploratory behaviour and stress resistance."
"Zebrafish is gaining popularity in behavioral neuroscience in general and in alcohol research in particular. Alcohol is known to affect numerous molecular mechanisms depending on dose and administration regimen. Prominent among these mechanisms are several neurotransmitter systems. Here we analyze the responses of the dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurotransmitter systems of zebrafish to acute alcohol treatment (1 h long exposure of adult fish to 0.00%, 0.25%, 0.50%, or 1.00% ethyl alcohol) by testing the concentration of dopamine, its metabolite DOPAC, and serotonin and its metabolite 5-HIAA from whole brain extracts. We utilize a sensitive HPLC method and describe significant alcohol induced changes in zebrafish for the first time. We show that dopamine significantly increased in a quasi-linear dose dependent manner, DOPAC showed a smaller apparent increase which was non-significant, while both serotonin and 5-HIAA showed a significant increase only in the highest acute dose group. We discuss the methodological novelty of our work and theorize about the implications of the neurotransmitter level changes from a behavioral perspective."
"Immediately after unilateral, intranigral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), amphetamine (AMPH) evokes ""paradoxical"" contraversive rotation, whereas 14 days later, AMPH evokes the traditional ipsiversive rotation used to model the chronic Parkinsonian state. In this study, the hypothesis was that accelerated dopamine (DA) synthesis ipsilateral to the lesion augments cytoplasmic DA to produce paradoxical rotation. Therefore, the sensitivity to synthesis inhibition of AMPH-evoked rotation at 1 or 14 days after 6-OHDA was assessed. To determine the functional status that might be reflected by paradoxical rotation, sensorimotor abilities were examined at 1 and 14 days following unilateral 6-OHDA using the elevated swing, paw placement, grip strength, ladder walking, somatosensory neglect, and cylinder tests. At 14 days after 6-OHDA when AMPH-evoked ipsiversive rotation is mediated by the intact hemisphere, rotation was dose-dependently reduced by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) inhibition with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MPT) or dopa decarboxylase (DDC) inhibition with 3-hydroxybenzyl hydrazine (NSD-1015), indicating dependence upon newly synthesized DA. Conversely, at 1 day after 6-OHDA, paradoxical rotation, presumably mediated by the treated hemisphere, was completely resistant to synthesis blockade, indicating an abundant supply of intracellular DA that is independent from synthesis rates. Sensorimotor behaviors were not correlated with AMPH-evoked rotation. The present data do not support the hypothesis that enhanced DA synthesis is required to express paradoxical rotation. Therefore, alternative mechanisms that may enhance cytoplasmic DA to produce paradoxical rotation are discussed."
"Flunitrazepam has been reported to trigger cases of extreme violence in man and recently it was shown to heighten aggression in experimental rats. The underlying mechanisms may involve disinhibited/impulsive behavior. Here, tolerance developed to the behavioral disinhibiting effect of flunitrazepam in Vogel's drinking conflict model, both in rats treated with flunitrazepam (0.32 mg/kg/day) for three weeks, as well as in rats treated for six weeks (0.32 mg/kg/day three weeks + 0.56 mg/kg/day three weeks). The results suggest that behavioral disinhibition is of limited importance in the mechanisms underlying the pro-aggressive effect of chronic flunitrazepam administration."
"Our observation that male rat's innate fear response differed with hormonal status, as well as the higher prevalence of fear and anxiety disorders in human females led to the current investigation of the impact of phases of the estrus cycle on innate fear responding. Female rats in different phases of the cycle were exposed to an innate fear-inducing stimulus (2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline, TMT odor) and monitored for changes in behavior and brain activation. Behavioral data showed freezing responses to TMT were significantly enhanced during estrus as compared to other phases of the cycle. This data was supported by significant increases in pixel intensity in cortical and sub-cortical regions in estrus compared to proestrus and diestrus. Imaging results demonstrated significant increases in brain activation in the somatosensory and insular cortices when comparing estrus to diestrus. There were significant increases in neural activity in the bed nucleus of the stria terminals (BNST) and septum in estrus as compared to proestrus. Additionally, the hippocampus, hypothalamus, olfactory system, and cingulate cortex show significant increases in the estrus phase when compared to both diestrus and proestrus. Taken together, these results suggest that the female's hormonal status may be correlated with alterations in both neuronal and behavioral indices of fear."
"In the field of sensory perception, one noticeable fact regarding olfactory perception is the existence of several olfactory subsystems involved in the detection and processing of olfactory information. Indeed, the vomeronasal or accessory olfactory system is usually conceived as being involved in the processing of pheromones as it is closely connected to the hypothalamus, thereby controlling reproductive function. By contrast, the main olfactory system is considered as a general analyzer of volatile chemosignals, used in the context of social communication, for the identification of the status of conspecifics. The respective roles played by the main and the accessory olfactory systems in the control of mate recognition and sexual behavior are at present still controversial. We summarize in this review recent results showing that both the main and accessory olfactory systems are able to process partially overlapping sets of sexual chemosignals and that both systems support complimentary aspects in mate recognition and in the control of sexual behavior."
"The validity of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as a model for human disease depends on the development of parameters with clinical relevance. We tested the effect of treatment with MPTP in two newly developed non-invasive motor behavioral paradigms in the context of Parkinson's disease. The ""Tower"" was designed to quantify the marmoset's natural jumping behavior as a measure for akinesia, the ""Hourglass"" to test the marmoset's natural righting reflex as measure for rigidity, analogous to axial motor behavior in humans. MPTP treatment affected marmoset behavior in both testing paradigms. The marmoset's righting reflex in the Hourglass remained significantly impaired during the full 3-week period after the MPTP intoxication. In the Tower, the marmosets were not able to jump the largest distances one week after MPTP and showed a persistent reduction in activity during the 3-week period after the MPTP intoxication. Because not all aspects of motor behavior are similarly affected by MPTP, a complete behavioral sketch of parkinsonian marmosets should preferably include a range of motor behavior functions to create an overview of the full range of motor impairments. Both the Hourglass and Tower test provide important behavioral parameters in a clinically relevant multiple testing approach in motor disorder models."
"In the rat, social isolation during the early postnatal period disrupts the adult function of certain neuroendocrine and neurobehavioral systems. In the present study, we assessed the effects of peer and maternal contact during this period on the adult expression of aggression, maternal behavior, and the behavioral response to novelty. Female rat pups of the Wistar strain were reared across postnatal days 3-19 in one of the following conditions: (1) by their mother and with littermates (MR, control); (2) artificially reared in complete social isolation (AR); or (3) artificially reared in the presence of two same-age conspecifics (AR-Soc). As adults, all females were administered a resident-intruder aggression test, first in a non-maternal context (""territorial"" aggression) and then in the presence of their pups (""maternal"" aggression). Additionally, their maternal behavior and response to a novel object placed in a familiar open field arena were quantified. We found that maternal isolation impaired maternal behavior, increased maternal aggression, and increased the olfactory investigation of a novel object. The presence of peers prevented the effect of artificial rearing on aggression, but not its effects on maternal behavior or response to novelty. In the maternal aggression test, AR-Soc females engaged in significantly more sniffing of the intruder compared to the other two groups. The present results confirm and extend those of previous studies in a different strain (Sprague-Dawley), and indicate that peer-derived stimuli impact on the development of neurobehavioral systems underlying aggressive and non-aggressive social interactions, whereas the normal development of maternal behavior and response to novelty requires maternally derived stimuli."
"In rodents, the initial exposure to a novel stimulus or environment typically induces exploration. After prolonged exposure the level of exploration decreases. Recently we developed an odor-based novelty detection paradigm that broadly screens for functions such as olfactory perception, olfactory driven exploration and habituation, and novelty preference and memory. The advantage of such a paradigm is that it exploits the innate olfactory abilities of mice. Here we studied three strains of mice C57BL/6 (C57), 129/SvImJ (129), and a hybrid cross of these two strains (F1 hybrids), all of which are commonly used in the generation of genetically modified mice. In the first phase of this task mice are permitted to explore the test environment in order to habituate to it. This is followed by a sample phase in which two identical odor cubes are introduced to the test environment and the mice are allowed to explore both odor cubes. Finally during the test phase one of the odor cues is replaced with a cube that contains a different novel odor, and the mice are again allowed to explore. Typically, mice will express a preference for the novel stimulus, or in this case the novel odor cube. We also separately assessed simple odor detection. Our results show that compared to the C57 mice, 129 and F1 mice showed reduced levels of exploration and odor driven novelty preference."
"Receptor like protein tyrosine phosphatase zeta (RPTPz) (also known as RPTPbeta or PTPxi) is a tyrosine phosphatase widely expressed in the nervous system, thought to play a role in cell-cell communication. However, knocking out RPTPz does not induce major neural abnormalities in mice. In order to better assess the potential role of RPTPz in various neural functions, we performed a comprehensive behavioural characterization of CNS/PNS functions in knockout mice (RPTPz -/-) confirming previously observed impaired working memory functions and further demonstrating an altered motor coordination. Moreover, RPTPz -/- mice displayed reduced responses to moderate thermal and tactile stimuli, both in baseline and under inflammatory conditions. These findings assign novel functional role of RPTPz in motor coordination and nociception."
"An association has previously been demonstrated between prefrontal cortex (PFC) volume decreases and illness progression in schizophrenia. The impact of illness duration on the fronto-parietal working memory neural network, however, remains unexplored. We investigated the effect of ageing and duration of illness, and explored possible sex-specific effects of duration of illness, in working memory-related brain activity in schizophrenia. Fifty individuals (25 stable schizophrenia outpatients, 25 healthy controls) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during performance of an 'n-back' task. Patients performed significantly worse than controls. Duration of illness correlated with reduced dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity in males and reduced cerebellum activity in females, regardless of performance and age. Sex-specific effects of illness duration were also evident in the inferior frontal and superior temporal gyri (females) and the inferior parietal cortex (males) which generally show sexually dimorphic activation in healthy people. We detected no significant effect of ageing on neural activation of the working memory network in patients though such an effect was present in healthy controls. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that a longer duration of schizophrenic illness has sex-specific associations within the working memory neural network, with expected association between illness duration and impaired PFC activation apparent in male, but not in female patients. Additionally, brain regions that exhibit sexually dimorphic activation in healthy people may become compromised in the corresponding sex with illness progression."
"Sleep is essential to maintaining health and well-being. It has been demonstrated that some of the biological alterations caused by paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) are not completely reversed after a period of sleep rebound (SR). The purpose of this study was to determine to what extent the specific molecular changes that occur in the rat cerebral cortex after 96 h of PSD can effectively be reversed during 24h of recovery. Total RNA from the right cerebral cortex of Wistar male rats and GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 arrays were used to perform comprehensive microarray analysis of gene expression in control, PSD and SR groups. Microarray data were validated by Real Time qPCR. A total of 78 unique transcripts were differently expressed after PSD relative to control levels. These include genes related to metabolic processes, the circadian sleep-wake cycle, response to stimuli, regulation of cell proliferation and signaling pathways. After 24h of sleep rebound, approximately 62% of the sleep deprivation transcripts were again detected as differently expressed in the SR relative to the PSD group, although in the opposite direction. On the other hand, the expression of the remaining transcripts showed intermediate values between control and sleep-deprived animals. In summary, our results provide a unique set of transcripts that might be specific related to regulation of paradoxical sleep phase and sleep homeostasis processes, as well as to the biological basis of sleep disorders."
"The role of neuroscience for the understanding of cognitive processes is a matter of controversial discussions. While it is widely accepted that neuroscientific data do contribute to theories on cognition in some way, their specific value is most often not explicitly described. One central issue is the validity of the inference from neuroscientific data to underlying cognitive processes, which depends on the characteristic properties of the respective neuroscientific method. In the first part of this review, we discuss the conditions under which data from functional MRI (fMRI), surface EEG, and intracranial EEG recordings may be interpreted with respect to associated cognitive processes. We will show that due to the different signal characteristics in each domain, cognitive processes at different levels can be captured. In the second part, we address the specific contribution made by neuroscientific data to the understanding of cognition. We show that neuroscientific findings may move beyond psychological theories based on purely behavioral data in several respects, which again depend on the imaging modality. Taken together, we suggest that neuroscientific data contribute to the understanding of cognition by adding specific biological constraints and by extending the explanatory potential of psychological theories."
"The kinematics of locomotion was analyzed in two strains of great importance for the creation of mutated mice (C56BL/6 and 129/Sv). Different behavioral situations were used to trigger sequences of movement covering the whole range of velocities in the mice, and the variations of kinematic parameters were analyzed in relation with velocity. Both stride frequency and stride length contributed to the moving speed, but stride frequency was found to be the main contributor to the speed increase. A trot-gallop transition was detected at speed about 70 cm/s, in relation with a sharp shift in limb coordination. The results of this study were consistent with pieces of information previously published concerning the gait analyses of other strains, and provided an integrative view of the basic motor pattern of mice. On the other hand some qualitative differences were found in the movement characteristics of the two strains. The stride frequency showed a higher contribution to speed in 129/Sv than in C57BL/6. In addition, 129/Sv showed a phase shift in the forelimb and hindlimb, and a different position of the foot during the stance time that revealed a different gait and body position during walking. Overall, 129/Sv moved at a slower speed than C57BL/6 in any behavioral situation. This difference was related to a basal lower level of motor activity. The possibility that an alteration in the dopamine circuit was responsible for the different movement pattern in 129/Sv is discussed."
"Animal models are critical for the study of psychiatric disorders since they allow the use of invasive methods that cannot be used for ethical reasons in humans. Currently there are three general models of schizophrenia; (i) those produced with acute pharmacological intervention (i.e. MK-801, ketamine, PCP and amphetamine), (ii) genetic models (i.e. mutant DISC-1, D(2)-R over expression) and (iii) developmental disruption models (i.e. MAM, neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion, isolation rearing, maternal infection). Here we review evidence for the validity of gestational (day 17) MAM administration as a developmental disruption rodent model of schizophrenia. Offspring from MAM-treated dams are reported to display deficits consistent with those observed in schizophrenia patients, including anatomical changes, behavioral deficits and altered neuronal information processing. Thus gestational MAM administration has been demonstrated to induce a pathodevelopmental process leading to neuroanatomical and behavioral phenotypes consistent with that observed in schizophrenia in humans."
"Smooth pursuit eye movements have been linked to perception by a common attentional mechanism. We investigated whether perceptual performance was traded for smooth pursuit performance. While tracking a red target cross, observers had to discriminate the orientation of a flashed peripheral grating. We manipulated the priority given to the two tasks. Pursuit gain changed according to observers' effort to pursue the target, but perceptual discrimination of the peripheral flash was not affected by these changes, suggesting that smooth pursuit does not use the same resources as perception. Complete resource sharing may be confined to situations involving multiple moving objects. Next, we added a second perceptual task on the foveal pursuit target. Foveal discrimination performance was traded for peripheral discrimination performance and pursuit gain followed the perceptual priorities. Thus, smooth pursuit gain is affected by which target has been selected for enhanced perceptual processing, but that does not imply shared perceptual resources."
"In this study we examined behavioral sleep in the walrus, the only living species of the family Odobenidae. The behavior of four 1.5-2-year-old captive walruses was videotaped continuously for 7-17 days and scored in 1-min epochs. When walruses had access to water and land, behavioral sleep, the combined amount of quiet and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, occupied on average 17+/-4% of 24 h (n=4) with the majority of sleep occurring on land. All walruses alternated periods of almost continuous swimming lasting for 40-84 h with periods of rest on land lasting for 2-19 h. When in water they were predominantly awake (88-99% of the time). On land walruses were asleep on average 40-74% of the time. The total sleep time varied between 0 and 60% of 24h with the daily amount of REM sleep ranging from 0 to 5% of 24 h. In water, walruses slept while floating at the surface, lying on the bottom or standing and leaning against the pool wall. REM sleep in water occurred in all positions. On land the breathing pattern was regular during quiet sleep (most pauses were &lt;30s) and arrhythmic in REM sleep (apneas lasted up to 160 s). While in water the irregularity of breathing further increased (apneas were &gt;4 min) and all REM sleep episodes occurred during a single apnea. Data indicate that the pattern of sleep and breathing in walruses is similar to the Otariidae seals while on land and the Phocidae seals while in water."
"Exposure to psychostimulant drugs of abuse such as amphetamine can result in long-lasting ""sensitization"" of reward-directed behavior, such that subjects display enhancements in behavior directed by and toward rewards and reward-predictive cues (i.e. ""incentive sensitization""). The purpose of these experiments was to determine the degree to which such sensitization resulting from chronic amphetamine exposure influences both appetitive and consummatory food-motivated behavior. Adult male Long-Evans rats received daily i.p. injections of D-amphetamine (2.0 mg/kg) or saline vehicle for five consecutive days. This amphetamine exposure regimen produced lasting sensitization to the acute locomotor stimulant effect of the drug. One month after drug exposure rats were tested for instrumental responding (lever pressing) for food reward under various response schedules. Two months after drug exposure, rats were tested for food consumption in a discriminative Pavlovian context-potentiated eating task, involving pairings of one context with food and another context with no food. Amphetamine exposed rats showed significantly greater instrumental responding for food reward than saline controls, particularly under conditions of high response ratios. In the potentiated eating task, testing under conditions of food satiation revealed that amphetamine exposed rats ate significantly more than saline controls in the food-paired context. These experiments demonstrate that amphetamine exposure can cause enduring increases in both appetitive and consummatory aspects of natural reward-directed behavior. Such long-lasting incentive sensitization could account in part for the propensity for relapse in drug addiction, as well as for reported enhancements in non-drug reward-related behavior."
"We examined the effects of brief or long durations of repeated maternal separation (MS) on ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in rat dams. 50-kHz USVs putatively identified as maternal in origin were emitted only immediately after pups were returned following MS. Maternal USV emission also depended on separation duration and pup age. Given that 50-kHz USVs are emitted in response to rewarding stimuli, MS may induce duration-dependent effects on maternal positive affect."
"The behaviour of transgenic animals modelling human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) is typically characterised in artificial apparatuses rather than labour-intensively observing their spontaneous behaviour in the home environment. Here we report on an in-depth behavioural characterisation of the day-to-day life of a murine model for AD living in a large (6.6 m(2)) semi-naturalistic indoor enclosure. In a genotype-blind investigation, 40 different behavioural patterns of wildtype and transgenic animals were recorded at early ages, before plaques can be found in the brains of the transgenic mice; and later in life, when these mice are known to exhibit AD-like plaques. Basal stress hormone levels (corticosterone) and cerebral amyloid-beta depositions were determined, and compared with individually and group-housed mice from non-enriched standard cages. Semi-naturalistically housed transgenics could not be differentiated from wildtypes by their behavioural profiles nor by basal levels of corticosterone. Surprisingly, the brains of these transgenics revealed an even more pronounced plaque load than controls from standard-housing conditions. Behavioural traits are known to involve gene-environment interactions. Here we show for the first time that despite high beta-amyloid plaque load the day-to-day life of AD mice is not compromised when the genetic predisposition interacts with a generous physically and socially enriched environment."
"Immune system activation has been found to affect the function of the hippocampus. Sub-pyrogenic systemic inflammation impairs performance of species-typical behaviours that are also disrupted by hippocampal lesions in rodents. In a series of experiments the effect of a low, sub-pyrogenic dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on hippocampus-dependent learning and memory was tested. LPS failed to impair hippocampus-dependent spatial reference memory and working memory. However, LPS affected learning a simple side-discrimination task in which an arm of a T-maze was rewarded (correct arm), and the other arm was never rewarded (incorrect arm). Whereas LPS actually enhanced performance when reward was available on every trial in the correct arm, LPS impaired learning when the correct arm was rewarded on 50% of trials. Hippocampal lesions did not impair either the continuous or partial reinforcement versions of the task. These results demonstrate that a low, sub-pyrogenic dose of LPS can impair cognitive function, but can, depending on the demands of the task, also facilitate learning. However, the double dissociation between the effects of LPS and hippocampal lesions demonstrate that sub-pyrogenic inflammation does not affect learning by disrupting hippocampal function."
"The APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse is a double transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease, which harbors mutant mouse/human amyloid precursor protein (Swedish K594N/M595L) and presenilin-1 genes (PS1-dE9). These mice develop beta-amyloid plaques and exhibit visuo-spatial learning and memory impairment in the Morris water maze (MWM) at 8-12 and 16-18 months of age. To extend these findings, we tested visuo-spatial learning and memory of male and female APPswe/PS1dE9 mice at 16 months of age on the Barnes maze. APPswe/PS1dE9 mice showed impaired acquisition learning using measures of latency, distance traveled, errors and hole deviation scores, and were less likely to use the spatial search strategy to locate the escape hole than wild-type mice. APPswe/PS1dE9 mice also showed a deficit in memory in probe tests on the Barnes maze relative to wild-type mice. Learning and memory deficits, however, were not found during reversal training and reversal probe tests. Sex differences were observed, as male APPswe/PS1dE9 mice had smaller reversal effects than male wild-type mice, but females of each genotype did not differ. Overall, these results replicate previous findings using the MWM, and indicate that APPswe/PS1dE9 mice have impaired visuo-spatial learning and memory at 16 months of age."
"A large amount of evidence supports a role for the parietal and frontal cortex in the planning of reaching movements. Nevertheless, neither the timing of involvement of these areas nor if and how their activity can be influenced by external stimuli has been clarified. The parieto-occipital cortex has been investigated by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at 25% (Time 1), 50% (Time 2) and 75% (Time 3) of the reaction time from a go signal to hand movement. No local effect was found with Time 1, since pulses were administered before subjects opened their eyes. Reduction of reaction time was observed at Time 2 when stimuli were applied over the anterior occipital lobe, parieto-occipital cortex and posterior parietal cortex. The effect on the posterior parietal cortex reverted when Time 3 was used. The present data confirm the existence, in humans, of a dorso-medial set of areas involved in on-line planning of reaching movements. Moreover, they provide novel evidence on the time course of this involvement. Finally, present data show that it is possible to interact with the flow of activity along this stream by appropriately delivering TMS pulses."
"The accumulation of lysosome- and mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the most important causative factors for aging. Autophagic dysfunction and mitochondrial DNA damage in the central nervous system (CNS) are prominently found in microglia, the resident mononuclear phagocyte population within the CNS. The autophagic dysfunction may induce the defective turnover of mitochondria, which results in the accumulation of ROS-hypergenerating older mitochondria in microglia. ROS activate redox-dependent transduction cascades and transcription factors, including nuclear factor-kappaB, which induce the expression of inflammatory genes. Therefore, ""microglia-aging"" could function as a major driver for brain aging. Furthermore, the prevention of lysosomal autophagic dysfunction and mitochondrial DNA damage in microglia may therefore be a potentially effective new pharmaceutical intervention against brain aging."
"Little is known regarding which neural systems regulate dose-related changes in responses maintained by self-administered cocaine. This empirical question is important because elucidating neural systems engaged in this process could provide clues for effectively treating cocaine addiction. It has been suggested that different cocaine doses represent reinforcers of differing magnitudes, implicating the dorsal striatum or orbitofrontal cortex as important. Rats were trained to self-administer 1.0 mg/kg cocaine under a fixed-interval based second-order schedule. Next, cocaine unit doses (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) were each non-systematically available for a 5-day block of sessions. Tests (1h) were conducted on day 3 (vehicle) and day 5 (100 microg lidocaine) of each block. Lidocaine inactivation of the lateral dorsal striatum had no effect on dose-related responding or cocaine intake. In contrast, when doses along the ascending limb were available for self-administration, lidocaine inactivation of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex caused reductions in responding and cocaine intake, resulting in overall flattening of dose-response curves. This included reductions during the entire 1-h test sessions and during the interval immediately following the first cocaine infusion of test sessions. Lidocaine inactivation of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex did not alter responding during the first cocaine-free interval of test sessions, but increased the latency to the first infusion. Collectively, the findings suggest that when the amount of experience with different cocaine unit doses is limited to a few sessions, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex regulates the dose-related effects of self-administered cocaine, likely by processing information pertaining to the reinforcing value of each unit dose."
"Male-induced ovulation in sheep and goats (the 'male effect'), documented during the period 1940-1960, has long been shrouded in preconceptions concerning how, when and why it worked. These preconceptions became dogmas but recent research is challenging them so, in this review, we have re-visited some major physiological (breed seasonality; characteristics of the response; the nature of the male stimuli) and physical factors (duration of male presence; isolation from male stimuli) that affect the phenomenon. We reject the dogma that ewes must be isolated from males and conclude that male 'novelty' is more important than isolation per se. Similarly, we reject the perception that the neuroendocrine component of the male effect is restricted to anovulatory females. Finally, we re-assess the relative importance of olfactory and non-olfactory signals, and develop a perspective on the way male-induced ovulation fits with preconceptions about pheromonal processes in mammals. Overall, our understanding of the male effect has evolved significantly and it is time to modify or reject our dogmas so this field of research can advance. We can now ask new questions regarding the application of the male effect in industry and develop research so we can fully understand this biological phenomenon."
"Current transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer disease constitute a relevant tool to examine the relationships between neuropathological lesions, neurodegeneration and clinical syndromes. Nevertheless, addressing the relation between Abeta deposition and cognition deterioration requires careful adjustment for age to decipher underlying mechanisms of impairments and identify potential therapeutic targets. In the present work we have carried out a detailed behavioral analysis of the APP(751SL) transgenic mouse model testing 6 age-points (from 2 to 19-20 months) and estimating in parallel the cerebral Abeta deposition. The immunohistochemistry study indicated a fast progression of Abeta(17-24) staining in several brain structures that reached for most of them, a maximal level at 7-8 months of age. Behavioral experiments showed that APP(751SL) mice displayed alterations in some general functions (muscular strength, motor activity) whereas other functions are preserved (anxiety, exploration). Acquisition and extinction of an appetitive operant conditioning were used to assess early learning deficits. Hippocampal but not dorso-lateral striatal lesion was shown to delay extinction. Although some learning deficits were detected at 5-6 months in the acquisition of the operant conditioning task, more robust impairments in extinction were observed in 7-8-month-old mice. Indeed, spatial memory deficit was associated to a selective hippocampal CA1 impairment of learning-induced Zif268 activation. Because this mouse model displayed gradual memory deficits it gives the opportunity to investigate the temporal progression of molecular and cellular mechanisms that induce cognitive decline."
"The structural and functional changes occurring into the brain is the hallmark of its tremendous capacity for dealing with the complexity that we are facing throughout life. It is also the hallmark of what neuroscientists refer as neuroplasticity. The continuous generation of cohorts of new neurons in some discrete regions of the adult brain, including the olfactory system, is a newly recognized form of neuroplasticity that has been recently the focus of neuroscience studies. Several lines of evidence indicate that this recruitment of newly-generated neurons is extremely sensitive to the overall neuronal activity of the host circuits. Therefore, adult neurogenesis represents, not only a constitutive replacement mechanism for lost neurons, but also a process supporting a capacity of neural plasticity in response to specific experience throughout life. The remarkable complexity of the social life offers a host of daily challenges that require a diversity of brain mechanism to make sense of the ever-changing social world. This review describes some recent findings which have begun to define reciprocal relationships between the production and integration of newborn neurons in the adult brain and social behavior. These studies demonstrate how this domain of research has the potential to address issues in the functional contribution of adult neurogenesis in the expression of some social traits as well in the role of some social contexts to finely regulate the production, survival and integration of adult newborn neurons."
"The hypothesis of hypo-functionality of NMDA receptors in schizophrenia originates from the observation that administration of the NMDA antagonist phencyclidine (PCP) induces psychotic states that closely resemble schizophrenic symptoms and that persist after drug discontinuation. A large number of animal studies have used PCP and the NMDA antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801) almost interchangeably to model schizophrenia. However, PCP interacts with pharmacological targets other than NMDA receptors that are not affected by MK-801. In addition, although acute administration of either compound produces similar effects in animals, there is little information whether withdrawal from chronic MK-801 causes behavioral deficits that mimic schizophrenia symptoms as in the case of PCP. To clarify this issue, we compared the following behaviors in rats subjected to withdrawal from sub-chronic administration (2 x 7 days) of either PCP (5 mg/kg, i.p.) or MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.): (1) working memory in a variable-delayed alternation task in a T-maze, (2) social interaction, and (3) motor activity in response to a (a) novel environment, (b) mild stressor, and (c) d-amphetamine challenge. Withdrawal from sub-chronic PCP caused a delay-dependent impairment of working memory, reduced social interaction and enhanced d-amphetamine-induced motor activity. These results were not replicated in animals sub-chronically treated with MK-801, which displayed only a slight decrease in social interaction. These data suggest that pharmacological antagonism at NMDA receptors is not sufficient to explain the full spectrum of PCP psychotomimetic properties."
"Mammalian females have long been known to release olfactory attraction in their offspring. Mammary odor cues control infant state, attention and directional responses, delay distress responses, stimulate breathing and positive oral actions, and finally can boost learning. Here, we survey female-offspring odor communication in two mammalian species - European rabbits and humans - taken as representatives of evolutionary extremes in terms of structure and dynamics of mother-infant relations, and level of neonatal autonomy. Despite these early psychobiological differences, females in both species have evolved mammary structures combining multiple sources of endogenous and exogenous odorants, and of greasy fixatives, conferring on them a chemocommunicative function. To process these mammary chemosignals, neonates have co-evolved multiple perceptual mechanisms. Their behaviour appears to be driven by plastic mechanism(s) calibrated by circumstantial odor experience in preceding and current environments (fetal and postnatal induction of sensory processes and learning), and by predisposed mechanisms supported by pathways that may be hard-wired to detect species-specific signals. In rabbit neonates, predisposed and plastic mechanisms are working inclusively. In human neonates, only plastic mechanisms could be demonstrated so far. These mammary signals and cues confer success in offspring's approach and exploration of maternal body surface, and ensuing effective initial feeds and rapid learning of maternal identity. Although the duration of the impact of these mammary signals is variable in newborns of species exposed to contrasting life-history patterns, their functional role in setting on infant-mother interaction in the context of milk transfer can be crucial."
"Few neuroimaging studies have reported gender differences in response to human emotions, and those that have examined such differences have utilized face photographs. This study presented not only human face photographs of positive and negative emotions, but also video vignettes of positive and negative social human interactions in an attempt to provide a more ecologically appropriate stimuli paradigm. Ten male and 10 female healthy right-handed young adults were shown positive and negative affective social human faces and video vignettes to elicit gender differences in social/emotional perception. Conservative ROI (region of interest) analysis indicated greater male than female activation to positive affective photos in the anterior cingulate, medial frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus, all in the right hemisphere. No significant ROI gender differences were observed to negative affective photos. Male greater than female activation was seen in ROIs of the left posterior cingulate and the right inferior temporal gyrus to positive social videos. Male greater than female activation occurred in only the left middle temporal ROI for negative social videos. Consistent with previous findings, males were more lateralized than females. Although more activation was observed overall to video compared to photo conditions, males and females appear to process social video stimuli more similarly to one another than they do for photos. This study is a step forward in understanding the social brain with more ecologically valid stimuli that more closely approximates the demands of real-time social and affective processing."
"Using selective bi-directional breeding procedures, two different lines of mice were developed. The NC900 line is highly reactive and attacks their social partners without provocation, whereas aggression in NC100 animals is uncommon in social environments. The enhanced reactivity of NC900 mice suggests that emotionality may have been selected with aggression. As certain forms of anxiety promote exaggerated defensive responses, we tested NC900 mice for the presence of an anxiety-like phenotype. In the open field, light-dark exploration, and zero maze tests, NC900 mice displayed anxiety-like responses. These animals were less responsive to the anxiolytic actions of diazepam in the zero maze than NC100 animals; diazepam also reduced the reactivity and attack behaviors of NC900 mice. The NC900 mice had reduced diazepam-sensitive GABA(A) receptor binding in brain regions associated with aggression and anxiety. Importantly, there was a selective reduction in levels of the GABA(A) receptor alpha(2) subunit protein in NC900 frontal cortex and amygdala; no changes in alpha(1) or gamma(2) subunit proteins were observed. These findings suggest that reductions in the alpha(2) subunit protein in selected brain regions may underlie the anxiety and aggressive phenotype of NC900 mice. Since anxiety and aggression are comorbid in certain psychiatric conditions, such as borderline personality and posttraumatic stress disorder, investigations with NC900 mice may provide new insights into basic mechanisms that underlie these and related psychiatric conditions."
"It has been shown that CA1 subserves temporal ordering processes in the hippocampus. It has also recently been shown that transecting the subcortical outputs of dorsal CA1 via the dorsal fornix results in retrieval deficits similar to those seen after lesions to CA1. The present experiment was designed to evaluate the effects of disrupting CA1 subcortical outputs for the temporal processing of visual objects and for a visual object novelty detection paradigm. The results of the present study suggest that CA1 subcortical efferents are not critically involved in temporal processing of visual objects, but are critically involved in visual object novelty detection. The data also suggest that temporal processing and novelty detection may potentially be subserved by independent mechanisms in CA1."
"The teneurin C-terminal associated peptides (TCAPs) are a novel family of four endogenous peptides that have previously shown bioactive properties both in vitro and in vivo. Previously we have shown that repeated intracerebral injections of synthetic TCAP-1 modulate anxiety-like behaviors in three tests of anxiety, although the neural substrates responsible for these effects were previously unknown. In the current study, we examined both c-Fos induction and behavioral responses in the elevated plus maze and open field tests after a single intracerebroventricular dose of TCAP-1 followed by an intracerebroventricular injection of CRF in male Wistar rats. The results indicate that TCAP-1 injection attenuated the CRF-induced increase in c-Fos expression in the limbic system and many of the areas associated with the behavioral responses to stress, including the hippocampus, central and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, and dorsal raphe nucleus. Other areas, such as the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial nucleus of the amygdala, and locus coeruleus, displayed CRF-induced c-Fos levels that were unaffected by TCAP-1. Furthermore, TCAP-1 administration increased stretched-attend postures, a type of risk-assessment behavior, on the elevated plus maze. These results indicate that TCAP-1 may play a potential role in the regulation of stress by blocking CRF-mediated activity in specific stress-sensitive areas of the brain."
"We measured concentration-detection (i.e., psychometric) odor functions for the homologous ketones propanone (acetone), 2-pentanone, 2-heptanone, and 2-nonanone. Under a forced-choice procedure, stimuli were presented via an 8-channel air-dilution olfactometer that allowed natural sampling of the odorant and whose output was quantified by gas chromatography. Subjects (17-22 per compound) comprised young adults from both genders, all normosmics and nonsmokers. A sigmoid (logistic) equation tightly fitted group and individual functions. The odor detection threshold (ODT) was the concentration detectable at halfway (P=0.5) between chance (P=0.0) and perfect (P=1.0) detection. Odor sensitivity increased (i.e., thresholds decreased) from acetone to heptanone, remaining constant for nonanone. This relative trend was also observed in previous work and in odor thresholds compilations, but the absolute ODTs obtained here were consistently at the lower end of those reported before. Interindividual variability of ODTs was about 1 order of magnitude. These odor functions measured behaviorally in humans were obtained at vapor concentrations 1000 times lower than functions measured via activation, with similar 2-ketones, of receptor neurons converging into individual olfactory glomeruli of mice, visualized with calcium sensitive dyes. Odorant concentrations presented as vapors (as in behavioral studies) and those presented as liquids (as in cellular/tissue studies) can be rendered equivalent via liquid-vapor partition coefficients and, then, compared in relative olfactory potency. These comparisons can reveal how sensitivity is progressively shaped across levels of the neural pathway."
"Cerebral lateralization, the partitioning of cognitive tasks to one cerebral hemisphere, is a widespread phenomenon among vertebrates. Despite this diversity, every species studied to date shows substantial individual variation in the strength of lateralization. The neural basis of this trait is unclear, although asymmetries in cerebral structures have been investigated for over a century. The habenular nuclei, for example, have been shown to present striking neuroanatomical and/or neurochemical asymmetries in species ranging from jawless fish to mammals. In teleost fish, these nuclei are relatively symmetrical in most species. Those teleosts that do have asymmetrical habenular nuclei, show varying patterns of asymmetry in different species. Here we investigate the relationship between individual variation of asymmetry in the habenula of a South American cichlid fish, Geophagus brasiliensis, and behaviour in a commonly used test for visual laterality in fish, the detour task. We show that the strength of asymmetry in the habenula is correlated with strength of behavioural lateralization in the detour task. Both the strength and direction of habenular asymmetry are correlated with individual differences in growth rate. We suggest that this relationship results from processes linking growth rate and sexual differentiation to frequency-dependent variation in life-history strategies. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a relationship at the individual level between neural asymmetry and lateralized behaviour in a fish."
"In this experiment, we used a differential reinforcement of low rates (DRL) schedule to evaluate the performance of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and Wistar (WIS) rats, with the goal of dissociating the processes of timing and inhibition of responses through the use of two quantitative models: the peak deviation analysis and the temporal regulation model. The subjects were divided in two groups; the first group was exposed to 70 sessions under a DRL 10s schedule. SHR rats showed an apparent temporary deficit in the inhibition of responses process; however, no differences among strains were observed in terms of the timing process. The second group of rats was exposed to 30 sessions in DRL 10s schedule, before receiving three doses (2 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg) of methylphenidate. The results obtained through both models were consistent and indicated that at higher drug doses, the performance of all three strains of rats deteriorated. The impulsivity exhibited by SHR during acquisition supports the idea of these rats as an adequate animal model of ADHD. In contrast, evidence against this relies on the normal temporal processing found and in the worsening effect that methylphenidate produced in the process of inhibition of responses. These mixed results suggest the necessity of exploring timing behavior of other animal models in order to find a reliable animal model of ADHD."
"Hypnotic drugs designed to treat insomnia in adults are now increasingly used in children, but the effects of these compounds on neonatal sleep are poorly understood. We investigated the hypnotic effects of the commonly prescribed non-benzodiazepine sleep agent Zolpidem (Ambien) on sleep architecture and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in the neonatal ferret. Six ferret kits were surgically prepared for EEG/electromyographic (EMG) recordings using techniques adopted for use in neonatal animals. They were then administered in a counter-balanced design vehicle, or Zolpidem (2 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection (1x/day over three days at 1 p.m.). Zolpidem did not increase non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) or total sleep time. Instead Zolpidem reduced REM sleep and total sleep amounts and increased NREM sleep bout duration. Zolpidem also increased higher-frequency EEG energies during REM and NREM sleep and transiently produced a behavioral state that appeared intermediate between wake and sleep. Our findings demonstrate that hypnotics that improve sleep quality in adults may produce profoundly different behavioral changes in neonates."
"Learned helplessness represents a failure to escape after exposure to inescapable stress and may model human psychiatric disorders related to stress. Previous work has demonstrated individual differences in susceptibility to learned helplessness. In this study, we assessed different factors associated with this susceptibility, including strain, sex, and open-field behavior. Testing of three rat strains (Holtzman, Long-Evans, and Sprague-Dawley) revealed that Holtzman rats were the most susceptible to helplessness. Holtzman rats not only had the longest escape latencies following inescapable shock, but also showed spontaneous escape deficits in the absence of prior shock when tested with a fixed-ratio 2 (FR2) running response. Moreover, when tested with fixed-ratio 1 (FR1) running - an easy response normally unaffected by helplessness training in rats - inescapable shock significantly increased the escape latencies of Holtzman rats. Within the Holtzman strain, we confirmed recent findings that females showed superior escape performance and therefore appeared more resistant to helplessness than males. However, regression and covariance analyses suggest that this sex difference may be explained by more baseline ambulatory activity among females. In addition, some indices of novelty reactivity (greater exploration of novel vs. familiar open-field) predicted subsequent helpless behavior. In conclusion, Holtzman rats, and especially male Holtzman rats, have a strong predisposition to become immobile when stressed which interferes with their ability to learn active escape responses. The Holtzman strain therefore appears to be a commercially available model for studying susceptibility to helplessness in males, and novelty-seeking may be a marker of this susceptibility."
"Both the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and the hippocampus are important for spatial learning across species. Although hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) release has been associated with learning on a number of spatial tasks, relatively little is understood about the functional role of ACh release in the RSC. In the present study, spatial exploration was assessed in rats using a plus maze spontaneous alternation task. ACh efflux was assessed simultaneously in the hippocampus and two sub-regions of the RSC (areas 29ab and 30) before, during and after maze exploration. Results demonstrated that there was a significant rise in ACh efflux in RSC area 29ab and the hippocampus during maze traversal. The rise in ACh efflux across these two regions was correlated. There were no significant behaviorally driven changes in ACh efflux in RSC area 30. While both the hippocampal sectors and area 29ab displayed increases in ACh efflux during maze exploration, the percent ACh rise in area 29ab was higher than that observed in the hippocampus and persisted into the post-baseline period. Joint efflux analyses demonstrated a key functional role for ACh release in area 29ab during spatial processing."
"Social interactions with conspecifics markedly alter the neuroendocrine, behavioral and emotional responses to stressful events. Some of these effects involve observational learning and result in lasting changes of fear-motivated behavior. While most evidence reveals increased fearfulness after observation of fearful demonstrators (models) in a number of species, a few reports from human and non-human primates indicate that observational learning can also attenuate some forms of fear. In the present study, we set out to determine the effects of social modeling and observational learning on fear conditioning in the mouse. Observers were pre-exposed to a novel context in the presence of fearful (F group) or non-fearful (NF group) demonstrators. Mice of the F group acquired control levels of conditioned fear. On the other hand, mice of the NF group exhibited profound and persistent reduction of fear. The decrease of fear in NF observers was most likely due to context-specific impairments of fear conditioning, as revealed by selective effects on long- but not short-term contextual fear memory, and normal fear conditioning in response to a novel context or cue. The effect was lasting, but constrained by the shock intensity. Attenuation of fear conditioning resulting from interactions with non-fearful conspecifics was largely, but not entirely, mediated by vicarious learning. These findings identify an important social buffering process serving to prevent a lasting induction of fear in response to isolated, moderately intense stressful events."
"Rats were used in a spatial reorientation task to assess their ability to use geometric and non-geometric, featural, information. Experimental conditions differed in the size of the arena (small, medium, or large) and whether the food-baited corner was near or far from a visual feature. The main measure was the percentage of trials with first-choice visits to the baited corner (Corner C) and the geometric equivalent corner (Corner R). Regardless of arena size, only the rats in the near-feature condition learned to make more first-choice visits to Corner C than Corner R. However, in this condition, there was a significant trend suggesting an increasing and decreasing use of, respectively, featural and geometric information with increasing arena size. Continued training with the feature removed caused all rats to primarily visit Corners C and R, reflecting the exclusive use of geometric information. However, again, there was a significant trend suggesting a decreasing use of this type of information with increasing arena size. These results were discussed in the framework of data from previous studies assessing reorientation in other species and of an associative-learning model."
"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizure (SRS), is associated with behavioural problems, but the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been clearly identified. In the present study, kainic acid (KA) was administered systemically in adult male Wistar rats to induce SRS. Behavioural performance analyses at 2, 4, and 6 weeks post-status epilepticus (post-SE) showed spatial learning memory deficit, anxiety and increased locomotor activity in rats with long-term SRS compared with rats without SRS after normal saline (NS) or KA-valproate (KA-VPA) treatment. No neuronal cell loss was observed in the hippocampus at 6 weeks post-SE. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analyses revealed that down-regulation of NMDA receptor subunit 2B (NR2B) and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) expression in adult hippocampus was found at 4 weeks post-SE and a further decrease at 6 weeks post-SE compared with rats without SRS after NS or KA-VPA treatment. Furthermore, the decreased expression of NR2B and PSD-95 was correlated with the representatively behavioural deficit. These findings suggest that long-term SRS might decrease NR2B/PSD-95 expression in adult hippocampus and consequently cause behavioural deficits, including spatial learning memory deficit, anxiety and increased locomotor activity. Maintaining the expression of NR2B/PSD-95 might partially contribute to the normal behaviour in rats with long-term SRS."
"Previous studies have indicated that GABAergic disinhibition contributes to cognitive deficits mediated by NMDA receptor hypofunction in schizophrenia model of rats. However, the underlying mechanism of GABAergic disinhibition in schizophrenia remains elusive. In this study, we found that the maintenance of long term potentiation (LTP) was impaired in the hippocampus of rats with MK-801-induced cognitive impairments. The impairment of LTP maintenance was significantly reversed by picrotoxinin, a specific GABA(A) receptor-chloride channel blocker and furosemide, a K+-Cl- cotransporter 2 (KCC2) blocker, respectively. Furthermore, immunoblotting results indicated KCC2 expression in hippocampal CA1 of MK-801-treated rats was lower than that of normal rats before LTP induction. Additionally, LTP-accompanied downregulation of KCC2 was prevented in MK-801-treated rats during LTP induction. Our results suggested that KCC2 expression in hippocampal CA1 of MK-801-treated rats was not further decreased by LTP induction because of its low expression caused by MK-801 treatment. Accordingly, GABAergic inhibition was not further decreased during LTP induction due to the depressed basal GABAergic tone in MK-801-treated rats, Therefore, GABAergic disinhibition in MK-801-treated rats restricts the further downregulation of KCC2 during LTP induction and contributes to the stable GABAergic inhibition and the impaired LTP expression. Our results thus reveal the mechanism that GABAergic disinhibition contributes to cognitive deficits."
"The medial prefrontal cortex has been associated with fear, anxiety and stress regulation, and has recently been suggested to play a crucial role in the development of behavioural changes in response to stress. In this study, we evaluated medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) involvement in both anxiety-like behaviour and increased anxiety-like responses induced by uncontrollable restraint. Rats with mPFC electrolytic lesions (n=7) and sham-lesioned (n=8) were tested in the elevated T-maze (ETM). Restrained rats with mPFC lesions (n=8) and sham-lesioned rats (n=6) were tested in the elevated T-maze 24h after restraint. Both two-trial passive avoidance and one-trial escape behaviours were assessed. The results revealed that mPFC lesions impair passive avoidance, but not escape behaviour. In addition, decreased anxiety-like behaviour in both passive avoidance and escape behaviours were observed in restrained rats with mPFC lesions. Our results suggest that mPFC is important in mediating both anxiety-like behaviour expression and long-term anxiogenic-like effects induced by acute restraint."
"Memory impairment is considered to be one of the most prominent consequences of aging. Deterioration of memory begins in advance of old age in animals, including humans. Thus, it is extremely important to prevent memory decline for increasing healthy aging. Ginsenoside, the effective ingredient of ginseng, has been reported to have a neuron beneficial effect, but the preventive role on memory impairment and the underlying mechanisms have not been well determined. In the present study, C57BL/6J mice aged 12 months were chronically treated with ginsenoside 100mg/kg per day for 8 months. Placebo-treated aged mice, young and adult ones (4- and 8-month-old, respectively) were used as controls. The efficacious effect of ginsenoside was manifested in the amelioration of memory impairment in aged mice by Morris water maze and step-down tests. Compared with aged control group, the plasticity-related proteins including phospho-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor1 (NMDAR1), phospho-calcium-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMK II), phospho-PKA catalytic beta subunit (PKA Cbeta), phospho-cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in hippocampus significantly increased in ginsenoside treated group. These findings suggest that ginsenoside is effective on the prevention of age-related memory impairment, and the up-regulation of plasticity-related proteins in hippocampus may be one of the mechanisms."
"Zebrafish is gaining popularity in basic behavioral brain research, behavior genetics, and in translational studies because it offers a cheap and efficient alternative to rodents. Abnormally exaggerated fear and anxiety are some of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric diseases in the human society whose mechanisms are not well understood. These diseases still represent major unmet medical needs. Ethologically relevant fear paradigms involving the presentation of predators, or of stimuli characteristic of predators, have been proposed as appropriate for the modeling and the analysis of fear responses. Previously, we have shown that zebrafish respond specifically to visual stimuli of their sympatric predator, the Indian leaf fish. In the current paper we show that an animated (moving) image of this predator elicits significant behavioral responses and that these responses can be quantified using video-tracking. As stimulus presentation and behavioral response quantification are both computerized and automated, we suggest the paradigm is appropriate for high throughput screening and, once pharmacologically and behaviorally validated, may have utility in the detection of anxiolytic or anxiogenic properties of compounds or in the identification of fear altering mutations."
"A primary aim in the neuroscientific study of depression is to identify the brain areas involved in the pathogenesis of symptoms. In this review, we describe evidence from studies employing various experimental approaches in humans (functional imaging, lesion method, and brain stimulation) that converge to implicate the ventromedial and dorsolateral sectors of prefrontal cortex as critical neural substrates for depression, albeit with distinct functional contributions. The putative roles of ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in depression are discussed in light of the results."
"A possible relationship between circadian rhythms and affective disorders has been strongly implicated, but understanding of the biological basis of such a relationship demands the utilization of appropriate animal models. Most research is performed with nocturnal rodents while some of the effects of daylight cycles or melatonin levels in nocturnal animals may differ greatly from effects in diurnal species (including humans). Recent studies suggested the diurnal fat Sand rat as an appropriate model animal to study circadian mechanisms involvement in mood and anxiety disorders, especially seasonal affective disorder (SAD). These studies demonstrated that Sand rats chronically exposed to short daylight (SD), or to melatonin regimen mimicing short daylight, show anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. These findings established face and construct validity for the model. The present study evaluated predictive validity by testing the effects of bright light treatment in Sand rats exposed to chronic SD. Sand rats maintained on SD for 3 weeks were treated with 1h daily 3000lx light for 3 weeks, 1h after ""lights on"" (during the light phase of the light/dark cycle), and their behavior tested in the sweet solution preference test (SSP), elevated plus-maze (EPM) and forced swim test (FST) and compared with control animals without treatment. Results indicate that bright light treatment reduced anxiety-like behavior in the EPM and depression-like behavior in the FST but not SSP. It is suggested that the results support the possibility that the diurnal Sand rat might be a preferred model animal for the study of SAD."
"There is considerable evidence for the involvement of cerebellar structures and circuits in classical conditioning of eyeblink responses (EBC) and in the pathophyiology of schizophrenia, leading to the expectation that schizophrenia patients should exhibit impaired EBC. A review of the literature indicates that such a position is not supported. Of the nine published studies, three reported poorer EBS in patients compared to controls, three reported better EBC, and three reported no significant EBC differences between the groups. Overall, medicated schizophrenia patients showed poorer EBC, and non-medicated patients exhibited better or normal EBC, relative to healthy control groups. In the light of those results and the fact that no experiment explicitly compared medicated and non-medicated patients, one cannot assume that the EBC deficits in patient groups are attributable to anything other than an effect from medication."
"Rats classified as high responders (HR) based on their response to an inescapable novel environment self-administer more amphetamine and have greater amphetamine-induced sensitization than rats classified as low responders (LR). Recent research suggests that the central nucleus of the amygdala (ACe) contributes to the elevated self-administration in HR rats. Therefore, the current study examined the role of the ACe in the expression of both amphetamine-induced sensitization and conditioned hyperactivity in HR and LR rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were screened for their response to inescapable novelty and classified as HR or LR rats. Rats were implanted with bilateral cannulae into the ACe and received amphetamine (1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) or saline injections immediately prior to 1-h locomotor sessions. Following five training sessions, all rats received an infusion of muscimol (0.5 microg/0.5 microl) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by a saline injection to measure conditioned hyperactivity. HR rats displayed conditioned hyperactivity, while LR rats did not, suggesting that HR and LR rats differ in the expression of conditioned hyperactivity. While ACe inactivation attenuated the expression of conditioned hyperactivity, it did not differentially affect HR and LR rats. Following additional training and a 10-day rest period, all rats were then tested for amphetamine-induced sensitization (1.0 mg/kg) following an infusion of muscimol or PBS. Inactivation of the ACe attenuated the expression of sensitization only in HR rats. These results suggest the ACe contributes to the greater amphetamine sensitization in HR rats."
"Acetylcholine and norepinephrine have been implicated during different kinds of social recognition that involves olfactory memory formation. For example, blockade of muscarinic and beta-adrenergic receptors has been shown to impair short-term memory of both socially relevant as well as of neutral odors. However, previous studies have not explicitly compared the role of cholinergic and adrenergic modulation in long-term memory for socially relevant odor vs. incidental odor stimuli. In this work, we studied the function of muscarinic and beta-adrenergic receptors during acquisition and/or consolidation of a novel odor and during the retrieval of a familiar odor. The effects of systemic injections of scopolamine and propranolol, before and after presentation of estrous urine odor or mint odor, were evaluated by a long-term odor habituation task. The results demonstrated that scopolamine disrupts memory acquisition and/or consolidation of mint odor, and did not have any effect during retrieval of mint odor memory. Conversely, scopolamine disrupts memory consolidation and retrieval of estrous odor, depending on the dose applied. Propranolol injections have no effect on acquisition or consolidation for mint or estrous odor, but disrupt memory retrieval of familiar odor regarding their social/sexual or neutral content. These results demonstrate that muscarinic receptors are required differentially during long-term odor memory formation and for familiar odor recognition depending on the socially relevant content of the stimulus. Furthermore, the beta-adrenergic system could play an important role in memory recognition for familiar odors, regardless of the sexual/social or neutral content of the stimuli."
"The aim of the present study was to examine whether a single infusion of human adult mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) has protective effects on rat cognitive functions after systemic hemorrhagic shock. Systemic hemorrhagic rat shock model of pronounced (30 min) systemic hypotension [30-40 mmHg mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) reduction] was used to induce cerebral oligemia. Immediately after the experimental transient hypotension period ended, human processed lipoaspirate-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC, 1 x 10(6)) were administered via the femoral vein. Rats were tested in relation to their cognitive spatial abilities using the Morris water maze before and 3 days after transient oligemia and with/without hMSC transplantation. Immunohistological investigations were performed with respect to apoptosis and BrdU staining. A clear functional improvement was observed in the rats' spatial cognitive abilities after hypotension and subsequent hMSC transplantation. In the hypotension group, hMSC infusion reduced the mortality from 50% to 25%. Six days after hMSC administration and hypotension, we did not detect any BrdU-labeled cells in rat brain, lung, and liver; however, BrdU-positive cells were found in spleen. No signs of cerebral apoptosis were observed. We conclude from this study that hMSCs derived from peripheral blood could be an important cell source to improve functional outcome after transient cerebral oligemia. Identifying the underlying mechanism for this, however, should be the subject of further investigations."
"In the present study, the effects of subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of morphine, a mu-opioid receptor agonist and intra-dorsal hippocampal (intra-CA1) injections of naloxone, a mu-opioid receptor antagonist on muscimol state-dependent memory were examined in mice. A single-trial step-down passive avoidance task was used for the assessment of memory retention in adult male NMRI mice. Pre-training intra-CA1 administration of a GABAA receptor agonist, muscimol (0.025, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 microg/mouse) dose dependently induced impairment of memory retention. Pre-test injection of muscimol (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 microg/mouse, intra-CA1) induced state-dependent retrieval of the memory acquired under pre-training muscimol (0.1 microg/mouse, intra-CA1) influence. Pre-test injection of morphine (0.5 and 1 mg/kg, s.c.) 30 min before the administration of muscimol (0.1 microg/mouse, intra-CA1) dose dependently inhibited muscimol state-dependent memory. Pre-test intra-CA1 injection of naloxone (0.1 and 0.2 microg/mouse, intra-CA1) improved pre-training muscimol (0.1 microg/mouse)-induced retrieval impairment. Moreover, pre-test administration of naloxone (0.1 and 0.2 microg/mouse, intra-CA1) with an ineffective dose of muscimol (0.025 microg/mouse) significantly restored the retrieval and induced muscimol state-dependent memory. These findings implicate the involvement of a dorsal hippocampal mu-opioid receptor mechanism in muscimol state-dependent memory."
"The hippocampus has been implicated in aspects of spatial memory. Its ability to generate new neurons has been suggested to play a role in memory formation. Hippocampal serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission has also been proposed as a contributor to memory processing. Studies have shown that the 5-HT(7) receptor is present in the hippocampus in relatively high abundance. Thus the aim of the present study was to investigate the possible role of the 5-HT(7) receptor in spatial memory using 5-HT(7) receptor-deficient mice (5-HT(7)(-/-)). A hippocampus-associated spatial memory deficit in 5-HT(7)(-/-) mice was demonstrated using a novel location/novel object test. A similar reduction in novel location exploration was observed in C57BL/6J mice treated with the selective 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist SB-269970. These findings prompted an extended analysis using the Barnes maze demonstrating that 5-HT(7)(-/-) mice were less efficient in accommodating to changes in spatial arrangement than 5-HT(7)(+/+) mice. 5-HT(7)(-/-) mice had specific impairments in memory compilation required for resolving spatial tasks, which resulted in impaired allocentric spatial memory whereas egocentric spatial memory remained intact after the mice were forced to switch back from striatum-dependent egocentric to hippocampus-dependent allocentric memory. To further investigate the physiological bases underlining these behaviors we compared hippocampal neurogenesis in 5-HT(7)(+/+) and 5-HT(7)(-/-) mice employing BrdU immunohistochemistry. The rate of cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus was identical in the two genotypes. From the current data we conclude that the 5-HT(7)(-/-) mice performed by remembering a simple sequence of actions that resulted in successfully locating a hidden target in a static environment."
"The parietal cortex consists of several prominent anatomical regions in the posterior part of the human brain. Although very heterogeneous stimuli and tasks activate parietal brain regions, a large body of empirical evidence points to a particular role of the posterior parietal cortex in spatial cognition. This article aims at providing a comprised overview regarding the existing evidence on the functional architecture of posterior parietal cortex and its relation to spatial cognition abilities. The article summarizes and systematically compares evidence from lesion, human functional brain imaging, and human functional brain interference studies, providing the whole range from early neuropsychological insights to latest state-of-the-art multimodal functional imaging and multivariate brain connectivity approaches. As for this latter type of evidence, the article outlines in more detail how our group has recently applied: (i) combined TMS &amp; fMRI, (ii) data-driven multivariate fMRI, and (iii) effective brain connectivity analyses in order to functionally segregate the specific contribution of various parietal sub-regions for particular spatial sub-functions. Based on these recent findings, it is proposed that we are now at the verge of applying these new analytical frameworks in human functional brain imaging in order to functionally fractionate brain regions which are conventionally modelled as functional units, e.g. areas within the posterior parietal cortex, into distinct subdivisions with different functional contributions."
"The glia-derived molecule kynurenic acid (KYNA) is an antagonist of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and the glycine(B) binding site on NMDA receptors. KYNA levels are elevated in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of persons with schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, both of which are characterized by deficits in contextual learning and memory. The present study tested the hypothesis that increases in KYNA concentration would impair contextual fear conditioning but spare cue-specific fear conditioning. Rats in each experiment received injections of vehicle solution or l-kynurenine (L-KYN, 100mg/kg), the precursor for KYNA. Administration of L-KYN has been shown to produce clinically relevant increases in KYNA concentration. In Experiment 1, L-KYN-treated rats exhibited impaired contextual fear memory compared to control rats, while fear conditioning to a discrete auditory cue was unaffected. In Experiment 2, rats were trained to discriminate between two different training environments, one in which foot shock was delivered and one that was not paired with foot shock. Although both groups of rats eventually learned the discrimination, learning was slower in L-KYN-treated rats. The results of Experiment 3 demonstrated that the deficits in context discrimination could not be explained by the preferential use of an elemental learning strategy by L-KYN-treated rats. Together, these findings indicate that elevated concentration of endogenous KYNA interferes with contextual learning and memory and support the notion that increased concentration of KYNA may contribute to cognitive dysfunction. In addition, these data provide new insight into how novel 'gliotransmitters' may modulate neuronal function and behavior."
"We investigated whether the ventral and dorsal hippocampus were differentially involved in incidental spatial learning. Rats with ventral and dorsal hippocampal lesions were tested on an unreinforced test of spatial memory that takes advantage of their natural propensity to explore novelty. Rats were presented with two copies of an identical object in a large circular open field arena. Subsequently, the rats were placed back into the open field with one of the objects displaced to an adjacent quadrant of the arena. Sham-operated rats and rats with ventral hippocampal lesions spent more time in the quadrant that contained the displaced object than in the quadrant that contained the non-displaced object, and more time investigating the displaced object than the non-displaced object. Rats with dorsal hippocampal lesions were impaired on both measures. Both sham and ventral hippocampal lesioned rats subsequently learned to retrieve a food pellet in the ends of each arm of a radial maze. Rats with lesions to the dorsal hippocampus showed no significant improvement in the number of errors made across training sessions and made significantly more errors, overall, than rats with ventral hippocampal or sham lesions. The findings suggest that an intact dorsal but not ventral hippocampus is necessary for spatial learning in rats."
"This study was conducted to explore the modulation of GTPs on cognitive performances in psychological stress rats. Wistar rats were randomly assigned to five groups as follows: control group, stress group, and three stress groups with low, medium and high-doses of GTPs modulation respectively. The changes of cognitive performances were examined by open-field test, water maze and step-through test. Results demonstrated that serum levels of cortisol were all increased obviously in four stress groups. The cognitive performances of stress group were changed evidently. And these changes were improved in stress medium and high-doses of GTPs modulation groups. In addition, plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-2 were increased in four stress groups, serum norepinephrine and dopamine were decreased dramatically in stress group and stress low-dose GTPs modulation group. The serum norepinephrine and dopamine levels in stress medium and high-doses of GTPs modulation groups were increased in contrast to that of stress group. Furthermore, the changes of anti-oxidative capacity in brain tissue were also measured. Except superoxide dismutase, the changes of malondialdehyde, reactive oxidative species and total anti-oxidative capacity of stress group were significantly different from that of control group. These changes in stress medium and high-doses of GTPs modulation groups were improved. Our results suggested that psychological stress impaired body's cognitive performances, and moderate GTPs modulation could improve these abnormal changes. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing the improving effects of GTPs on cognitive dysfunctions induced by psychological stress."
"Motor cortex stimulation oriented by functional cortical mapping is used mainly for treating otherwise intractable neurological disorders, however, its mechanism of action remains elusive. Herein, we present a new method for functional mapping of the rat motor cortex using non-invasive transdural electrical stimulation. This method allows a non-invasive mapping of the surface of the neocortex providing a differentiation of representative motor areas. This study may facilitate further investigation about the mechanisms mediating the effects of electrical stimulation, possibly benefiting patients who do not respond to this neuromodulation therapy."
"Behavioral economists have proposed that human preferences are constructed during their elicitation and are thus influenced by the elicitation procedure. For example, different preferences are expressed when options are encountered one at a time or concurrently. This phenomenon has been attributed to differences in the ""evaluability"" of a particular attribute when comparison to an option with a different value of this attribute is or is not available. Research on the preferences of laboratory animals has often been carried out by means of operant-conditioning methods. Formal treatments of operant behavior relate preferences to variables such as the strength and cost of reward but do not address the evaluability of these variables. Two experiments assessed the impact of procedural factors likely to alter the evaluability of an opportunity cost (""price""): the work time required for a rat to earn a train of rewarding electrical brain stimulation. The results support the notion that comparison between recently encountered prices is necessary to render the price variable highly evaluable. When price is held constant over many trials and test sessions, the evaluability of this variable appears to decline. Implications are discussed for the design of procedures for estimating subjective reward strengths and costs in operant-conditioning experiments aimed at characterizing, identifying and understanding neural circuitry underlying evaluation and choice."
"The effect of long-term voluntary exercise (running wheel) on anxiety-like behaviour (plus maze and open field) and learning and memory processes (object recognition and two-way active avoidance) was examined on Wistar rats. Because major individual differences in running wheel behaviour were observed, the data were analysed considering the exercising animals both as a whole and grouped according to the time spent in the running wheel (low, high, and very-high running). Although some variables related to anxiety-like behaviour seem to reflect an anxiogenic compatible effect, the view of the complete set of variables could be interpreted as an enhancement of defensive and risk assessment behaviours in exercised animals, without major differences depending on the exercise level. Effects on learning and memory processes were dependent on task and level of exercise. Two-way avoidance was not affected either in the acquisition or in the retention session, while the retention of object recognition task was affected. In this latter task, an enhancement in low running subjects and impairment in high and very-high running animals were observed."
"Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) have been observed in a number of rodent species. They occur under a variety of conditions, including aversive and stressful experiences. In the current study, we recorded USVs emitted by rats exposed to intermittent cold water swim (ICWS) stress and subsequently evaluated their performance in an instrumental swim escape test (SET). In the SET, rats exposed to ICWS fall into two categories, resilient or vulnerable, based on good or poor learning, respectively. Four of 16 rats exposed to ICWS emitted far more USVs during the stress procedure than the remaining 12. Interestingly, in the SET these USV-emitting rats appeared resilient with escape performance comparable to controls while on average the non-emitting rats failed to learn. This result demonstrates that USVs can serve as a predictor of stress resilience. USV screening during stress may serve as a novel and non-invasive strategy to predict subsequent stress reactivity and afford insight into the neural systems involved in resilience."
"The R6/2 mouse is a popular model of Huntington's disease (HD) because of its rapid progression and measurable behavioral phenotype. Yet current behavioral phenotyping methods are usually univariate (e.g., latency to fall from a rotarod) and labor intensive. We used a force-plate actometer and specialized computer algorithms to partition the data into topographically specific behavioral categories that were sensitive to HD-like abnormalities. Seven R6/2 male mice and 7 wild-type (WT) controls were placed in a 42 cm x 42 cm force-plate actometer for 20-min recording sessions at 6-7, 8-9, 10-11 and 12-13 weeks of age. Distance traveled, number of wall rears, and number of straight runs (traveling 175 mm or more in 1.5s) were reduced in R6/2 relative to WT mice at all ages tested. Low mobility bouts (each defined as remaining continuously in a virtual circle of 15 mm radius for 5s) were increased in R6/2 mice at 6-7 weeks and beyond. Independent of body weight, force off-load during wall rears was reduced in R6/2 mice except at 6-7 weeks. Power spectra of force variation during straight runs indicated an age-related progressive loss of rhythmicity in R6/2 compared to WT, suggesting gait dysrhythmia and dysmetria. Collectively, these data, which extend results obtained with other widely different behavioral phenotyping methods, document a multifaceted syndrome of motor abnormalities in R6/2 mice. We suggest, moreover, that the force-plate actometer offers a high-throughput tool for screening drugs that may affect symptom expression in R6/2 or other HD model mice."
"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be used in two different ways to investigate the contribution of cortical areas involved in grasp/reach movements in humans. It can produce ""virtual lesions"" that interfere with activity in particular cortical areas at specific times during a task, or it can be used in a twin coil design to test the excitability of cortical projections to M1 at different times during a task. The former method has described how cortical structures such as the ventral premotor cortex (PMv), dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) are important for specific aspects of reaching, grasping and lifting objects. In the latter method, a conditioning stimulus (CS) is first used to activate putative pathways to the motor cortex from, for example, posterior parietal cortex (PPC) or PMd, while a second, test stimulus (TS), delivered over the primary motor cortex a few ms later probes any changes in excitability that are produced by the input. Thus changes in the effectiveness of the conditioning pulse give an indication of how the excitability of the connection changes over time and during a specific task. Here we review studies describing the time course of operation of parallel intracortical circuits and cortico-cortical connections between the PMd, PMv, PPC and M1, thus demonstrating that functional interplay between these areas and the primary motor cortices is not fixed, but can change in a highly task-, condition- and time-dependent manner."
"Human adolescents drink partly to facilitate their social interactions, a social facilitatory effect of ethanol also seen in adolescent rats tested under familiar test circumstances. To explore the role of hedonic affect in ethanol-induced social facilitation, this study assessed 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in pair-housed adolescent (P29-37) and adult (P71-79) Sprague-Dawley male rats during social interactions. On each of eight test days, animals were socially isolated for 3 h and then injected intraperitoneally with 0 (saline), 0.25 or 0.5 g/kg ethanol. Twenty-five minutes later they were placed alone in a familiar test chamber for a 5-min period, followed by a 10-min encounter with a similarly injected peer. USVs were recorded during this 10-min period, while social interactions were videotaped for later scoring. BECs were measured immediately post-test on day 8. Although the 0.25 g/kg dose of ethanol facilitated play fighting in adolescents but not adults, ethanol had little to no effect on 50 kHz USV production under these test circumstances. USV production was higher in adults than adolescents, despite adolescents consistently engaging in more social behavior. To the extent that 50 kHz USVs index the hedonic value of social interactions, these findings support the conclusion that elevations in social behavior normally evident in adolescents may not be related to increases in hedonic sensitivity for social stimuli."
"Hypobaric hypoxia (HBH) can produce neuropsychological disorders such as insomnia, dizziness, memory deficiencies, headache and nausea. It is well known that exposure to HBH cause alterations of neurotransmitters and cognitive impairment in terms of learning and memory. But the mechanisms are poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate the cholinergic system alterations associated with simulated HBH induced cognitive impairment. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to HBH equivalent to 6100 m for 7 days in a simulation chamber. The cognitive performance was assessed using Morris Water Maze (MWM) task. Cholinergic markers like acetylcholine (ACh) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were evaluated in hippocampus and cortex of rats. Neuronal damage was also studied through morphological changes. Exposure to HBH led to impairment in relearning ability and memory retrieval and it was accompanied by decrease in ACh level and increase in AChE and led to morphological damage. Administration of AChE inhibitor (AChEI), physostigmine (PHY) and galantamine (GAL) to rats during HBH exposure resulted in amelioration of the deleterious effects induced by HBH. The AChEIs were able to improve the cholinergic activity by restoring the level of ACh by blocking the AChE activity. In addition, the AChEIs also prevented neurodegeneration by reducing the AChE level in cortical and hippocampal neurons."
"In an attempt to clarify conflicting results about serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(7) receptors in memory formation, their mRNA expression was determined by RT-PCR in key brain areas for explicit and implicit memory. The time-course (0-120 h) of autoshaped responses was progressive and mRNA 5-HT(1A) or 5-HT(7) receptors expression monotonically augmented or declined in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and raphe nuclei, respectively. At 24-48 h acutely 8-OH-DPAT (0.062 mg/kg) administration enhanced memory and attenuated mRNA 5-HT(1A)&lt;5-HT(7) receptors expression respect to saline group. WAY100635 (0.3 mg/kg) or SB-269970 (10.0 mg/kg) did not affect the former, partially blocked or reversed the latter, respectively. Furthermore, lower WAY100635 (0.001-0.1 mg/kg) or SB-269970 (1.0-5.0 mg/kg) doses plus 8-OHDPAT not affected memory; however both combinations suppressed or up-regulated mRNA expression 5-HT(1A) or 5-HT(7) receptors. In contrast, AS19 (5.0 mg/kg) facilitated memory consolidation, decreased or increased hippocampal 5-HT(7) and 5-HT(1A) receptors expression. Together these data revealed that, when both 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(7) receptors were stimulated by 8-OHDPAT under memory consolidation, subtle changes emerged, not evident at behavioral level though detectable at genes expression. Notably, high levels of efficient memory were maintained even when serotonergic tone, via either 5-HT(1A) or 5-HT(7) receptor, was down- or up-regulated. Nevertheless, WAY100635 plus SB-269970 impaired memory consolidation and suppressed their expression. Considering that serotonergic changes are prominent in AD patients with an earlier onset of disease the present approach might be useful in the identification of functional changes associated to memory formation, memory deficits and reversing or even preventing these deficits."
"Social isolation (SI) rearing in rodents causes a variety of behavioral changes, including hyperlocomotion, anxiety, impulsivity, aggression, and learning and memory deficits. These behavioral abnormalities in rodents may be related to the symptoms in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism, schizophrenia and depression. In this study, we examined the effect of long-term SI rearing after weaning on emotional behaviors and cognitive function in mice. Furthermore, the effects of methylphenidate (MPH), clozapine (CLZ) and fluoxetine (FLX) on SI-induced behavioral changes were examined to measure the predictive validity of SI-reared mice as an animal model for these neuropsychiatric disorders. MPH improved SI-induced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated-plus maze test, but had no effect on aggressive behavior. In contrast, CLZ ameliorated aggressive behavior, but not anxiety-like behavior in SI-reared mice. Repeated FLX treatment prevented SI-induced aggressive behavior and social interaction deficits. These findings suggest that SI-induced behavioral abnormality is a psychobehavioral complex relevant to various clinical symptoms observed in neuropsychiatric disorders and that SI-reared mice are a useful animal model to study the pathophysiology/pathogenesis of these diseases."
"In the early development of social cognition and language, infants tend to participate in face-to-face interactions engaging in joint attention exchanges. Joint attention is vital to social competence at all ages, lacking which is a primary feature to distinguish autistic from non-autistic population. In this study, diffuse optical imaging is used for the first time to investigate the joint attention experience in normal adults. Imaging studies were performed in the frontal regions of the brain (BA9 and BA10) in order to study the differences in the brain activation in response to video clips corresponding to joint attention based skills. The frontal regions of the brain were non-invasively imaged using a novel optical cap coupled to a frequency-domain optical imaging system. The statistical analysis from 11 normal adult subjects, with three repetitions from each subject, indicated that the averaged changes in the cerebral blood oxygenation levels were different under the joint and non-joint attention based stimulus. The preliminary studies demonstrate the feasibility of implementing diffuse optical imaging towards autism-related research to study the brain activation in response to socio-communication skills."
"The objective of the present study was to evaluate the possible role of dopamine D(1)/D(2) receptors of the central amygdala (CeA) on morphine-induced anxiolytic-like behaviour in adult male Wistar rats. The animals were bilaterally implanted with chronic cannulas the CeA and tested in an elevated plus maze (EPM) task. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of morphine (5 and 6 mg/kg) increased the percentage of open arm time (%OAT) and open arm entries (%OAE), indicating an anxiolytic-like response. Intra-CeA administration of different doses of the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine (0.1-0.3 microg/rat) significantly increased %OAE, but not %OAT. Furthermore, co-administration of the same doses of apomorphine with an ineffective dose of morphine (4 mg/kg; i.p.) significantly increased %OAT and %OAE by the opioid. Single microinjection of the D(1) dopaminergic antagonist SCH23390 (0.5-1.5 microg/rat) or sulpiride (0.5-1.5 microg/rat) into the CeA caused no significant change for %OAT and %OAE. The obtained results also show that intra-CeA microinjection of the same doses of SCH23390 or sulpiride inhibits the anxiolytic-like effect of morphine (6 mg/kg; i.p.). Pre-treatment of animals with SCH23390 (intra-CeA) or sulpiride (intra-CeA) reversed the response induced by apomorphine (0.3 microg/rat) plus morphine (4 mg/kg; i.p.). It should be considered that the drugs also did not show any effect on locomotor activity in all experiments. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the central amygdala dopaminergic mechanisms, probably via D(1)/D(2) receptors, may be involved in the modulation of morphine-induced anxiolytic-like behaviour in rat."
"Recent findings have highlighted the importance of DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein, 32 kDa), a key regulatory molecule in the dopaminergic signalling pathway for dopamine related phenotypes like antisocial-behavior, drug addiction and schizophrenia. This is the first study investigating the role of the DARPP-32 gene for personality. In a sample of n=838 healthy German Caucasian subjects we found a significant association between rs907094 and ANGER. Carriers of the T-allele showed significantly higher ANGER scores than participants without a T-allele (F((1,837))=9.52, p=0.002). In a second step we validated self-report data of ANGER by investigating their relation to structural brain differences in anger-related brain regions using voxel-based morphometry. A negative association between ANGER scores and the volume of the left amygdala could be detected. The present findings yield genetic evidence for the importance of dopaminergic signal transduction for the personality trait of ANGER. In addition volumetric MRI data support the role of the amygdala for the processing of anger."
"Previous studies revealed that vestibular cues are crucial for exploration in the absence of visual cues. The working hypothesis of this study was, accordingly, that mice with vestibular dysfunction would become disoriented or unable to globally explore an unfamiliar environment. In 2- and 3-month-old mutant headbanger (Hdb) mice, stereocilia of hair cells are abnormally elongated, yet maintain partial staircase arrangement, suggesting some spared vestibular function at these ages. Here we tested a group of 3-month-old mutant Hdb and a group of non-mutant mice obtained from the same litters (Wt mice). Each individual mouse was introduced into a dark 120 cm x 120 cm arena and its behavior was followed for 10 min. Hdb mice were hyperactive and appeared to engage in local exploration, traveling in a restricted zone for a while and then shifting to travel in another zone. In contrast, Wt mice traveled across zones incessantly with fewer visits to recently entered zones. Thus, Hdb seemed to display local compared with the global exploration of Wt mice, indicating that they were less oriented in the global environment. In addition, Hdb exhibited numerous stretch-attends, which is suggested as a sign of elevated anxiety. Altogether, the three comorbidities of hyperactivity, anxiety, and disorientation can be presented as a syndrome associated with vestibular deficiency in this animal model, and serve in studying vestibular deficiency in humans."
"An imbalance between different neurotransmitter systems is involved in the pathophysiological processes underlying schizophrenia. Since the neurotensin (NT) system modulates the activity of several of these neurotransmitters, drugs acting upon the NT system may act as novel antipsychotic drugs. This hypothesis is supported by studies with NT in animal models. For example, intracranial injection of NT improves sensorimotor gating in rats [Feifel D, Minor KL, Dulawa S, Swerdlow NR. The effects of intra-accumbens neurotensin on sensorimotor gating. Brain Research 1997;760:80-4]. NT-mimetics, such as NT69L, have been developed which are more resistant to enzymatic degradation than the native NT peptide. In the present study, the potential antipsychotic properties of NT69L were evaluated in a rat pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) paradigm. PPI is a measure of sensorimotor gating where a weak auditory stimulus, or pre-pulse, inhibits the startle response to a strong stimulus, or pulse. Schizophrenic patients exhibit deficits in their PPI response. This condition can be mimicked in rats with psychotomimetic drugs and the resulting PPI deficit is reversed by antipsychotic drugs. NT69L (0.1-10mg/kg i.p.) reversed disruptions of the PPI response induced by the NMDA antagonist dizocilpine (0.1mg/kg s.c.) for at least 1-h post-injection, but did not reverse disruptions induced by the dopaminergic agonists apomorphine and d-amphetamine (0.5 and 5mg/kg s.c., respectively). These results confirm that NT69L possesses antipsychotic-like activity and therefore could be beneficial in the treatment of schizophrenia."
"Deficits in pre-pulse inhibition (PPI-indicative of psychosis in humans) can be replicated in rats using the NMDA receptor antagonist phencyclidine (PCP). Ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs) produced by rats in response to acoustic startle are indicative of heightened anxiety; here we tested the predictive validity of USVs as an indicator of PPI. Male juvenile Sprague-Dawley rats (n=10) were treated for 14 days with either PCP (5mg/kg i.p.) or saline controls (1 ml/kg i.p.). PPI responses and USVs were recorded on days 16 and 19. PCP-treated rats showed decreased PPI performance on day 16 compared to controls; an observation that was unexpectedly reversed on day 19. Call parameters indicated that both treatment groups experienced similar levels of anxiety in response to the PPI paradigm on day 16. On day 19, the controls showed increased call duration and latency to onset (LtO) of calling, but decreased in the total number of calls produced compared to day 16. The calling period was significantly reduced compared to PCP-treated animals on say 19, whilst the LtO and duration were significantly increased. These changes were considered indicative of heightened levels of anxiety, most likely due to inadvertent fear conditioning (supported by reduced PPI performance) acquired during PPI testing. In contrast, the stability of USV characteristics emitted by PCP treated animals likely signified the detrimental effects of chronic PCP treatment on working memory. These results suggest that USVs are a valuable additional measure during PPI testing, helping to explain the unexpected results from our control group."
"Ethanol has been reported to disrupt spatial learning and memory in adolescent male rats. The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of ethanol on the acquisition of spatial memory in adolescent female rats. Adolescent female rats were subjected to repeated ethanol or saline treatments, and spatial learning was tested in the Morris water maze. For comparison, adult female rats were subjected to similar ethanol treatment and behavioral assessments as for adolescent rats. Ethanol-treated adolescent rats took longer and swam greater distances to find the hidden platform than saline controls. In the probe trial, ethanol-treated adolescent rats showed a trend towards reduced time spent in the target quadrant, and made significantly fewer target location crossings than saline-treated controls. Adult saline-treated control rats did not learn the spatial memory task as well as the adolescent saline-treated rats. Although ethanol in adult rats increased both latency and swim distance to find the platform, in the probe trial there was no difference between ethanol-treated adult rats and age-matched saline controls. Ethanol did not alter swim speed or performance in the cued visual task at either age. Together, these data suggest that ethanol specifically impairs the acquisition of spatial memory in adolescent female rats. Since adult females did not learn the task, ethanol-induced alterations in water maze performance may not reflect true learning and memory dysfunction."
"While dopamine replacement remains the standard pharmacotherapy for Parkinson's disease, chronic L-dopa treatment is associated with development of debilitating motor fluctuations such as L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). In this study we evaluated the effects of the partial dopamine D(2) agonist terguride on the development of LID in hemiparkinsonian mice (unilaterally lesioned with 6-hydroxydopamine). First, consistent with the partial agonist property, terguride had 1000-fold higher potency than dopamine, yet producing one-third level of maximal activation of dopamine, as assayed by [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding. Furthermore, in the absence and presence of dopamine in vitro, terguride increased and decreased striatal [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding, respectively. Next, we found that co-administration of terguride (at 0.1 and 0.5mg/kg, i.p.) with L-dopa (1.8 mg/kg) daily for 14 days, significantly attenuated the development and expression of L-dopa-induced rotational sensitization. Furthermore, the cross-challenge paradigm revealed that chronic L-dopa treatment (but not terguride) sensitized locomotor response to the dopamine D(1) agonist SKF 81297 while chronic treatment with terguride (but not L-dopa) produced sensitized locomotor responses to the adenosine A(2A) antagonist 8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine (CSC). Importantly, the co-administration of terguride with L-dopa did not show locomotor sensitization to either SFK 81297 or CSC upon challenge. Together, these results suggest that co-administration of partial dopamine D(2) agonists with L-dopa may prophylactically attenuate L-dopa-induced abnormal behavioral responses such as LID."
"Predator odors, which are non-intrusive and naturalistic stressors of high ethological relevance, were used to study the neurobiology of innate fear in rodents. The present study investigates behavioral effects and the induction of c-fos mRNA in adult male predator naive mice caused by acute exposure to 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT), a component of the fox feces odor. On the behavioral level, TMT potently increased unconditioned freezing and decreased non-defensive grooming behavior. With quantitative real time PCR we established a strong TMT-induced activation in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) (eight-fold increase, p&lt;0.016) and in the ventral olfactory bulb (two-fold increase, p&lt;0.036). In contrast, no significant TMT-induced c-fos induction could be observed in the dorsal olfactory bulb or in the amygdala. Our results display robust fear responses of GAD67-GFP knock-in mice exposed to TMT and suggest that the ventral olfactory bulb and the BNST are strongly activated during the elicitation of fear through predator odor in these transgenic mice."
"Accumulating evidence suggests that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are involved in both cocaine reinforcement and the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior. In the present experiments, rats were trained to self-administer cocaine under fixed ratio (for cocaine priming-induced reinstatement) or second-order (for cocaine cue-induced reinstatement) schedules of reinforcement. Lever pressing was then extinguished followed by a reinstatement phase where operant responding was promoted by either cocaine itself or cocaine-associated light cues. Results indicated that systemic administration of the mGluR5 antagonists 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP: 1 and 3mg/kg i.p.) or 3-((2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl)pyridine (MTEP: 0.1 and 1mg/kg i.p.) dose-dependently attenuated reinstatement of drug seeking induced by a systemic priming injection of 10mg/kg cocaine. Systemic administration of MTEP (0.1 and 1mg/kg i.p.) also dose-dependently attenuated cocaine cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. Systemic administration of neither MPEP nor MTEP influenced the reinstatement of sucrose seeking, which indicates that the effects of these compounds on cocaine seeking were reinforcer specific. Additionally, administration of MPEP (1microg/0.5microl) into the nucleus accumbens shell, a brain region that plays a critical role in cocaine seeking, attenuated cocaine priming-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. These results add to a growing literature indicating that mGluR antagonists attenuate the reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Importantly, the current findings also suggest that activation of mGluR5s specifically in the nucleus accumbens shell may promote the reinstatement of cocaine seeking."
"Despite growing evidences of an association between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and antidepressant effects, the neurotrophic hypothesis of depression is challenged by the paucity of direct links between BDNF deficit and depressive-like behaviors. The unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) paradigm might take our understanding a step further by examining whether a decrease in bdnf expression can lead to enhanced vulnerability to stress and prevent antidepressant efficacy in all or specific UCMS-induced alterations. Wild-type bdnf(+/+) and heterozygous bdnf(+/-) mice were exposed to an 8-week UCMS regimen and, from the third week onward, treated with either vehicle or imipramine (20mg/kg/day, ip). Physical, behavioral and biological (plasma corticosterone levels, bdnf expression in the dentate gyrus) measures were further analyzed regarding to the genotype and the treatment. Heterozygous bdnf(+/-) mice displayed hyperactivity and increase of body weight but no enhancement of the sensitivity to stress exposure in all the measures investigated here. In contrast, while imipramine treatment reduced anxiety-like behaviors in the novelty-suppressed feeding test in both genotypes, it decreased aggressiveness in the resident/intruder test and immobility in the tail suspension test in wild-type but not in heterozygous mice. Furthermore, imipramine induced a twofold increase of bdnf expression in the dentate gyrus in both genotypes, while bdnf(+/-) mice displayed roughly half-reduced level for the same treatment. In summary, we demonstrate here that depletion in BDNF dampened the antidepressant effects in several behaviors but failed to increase vulnerability to chronic stress exposure."
"The hippocampus is essential for consolidation of declarative information and spatial navigation. Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis tends to be preceded by a long prodromal period and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Our goal was to test whether amnestic MCI comprises two different subgroups, with hippocampal and non-hippocampal memory impairment, that vary with respect to spatial navigation ability. A total of 52 patients were classified into two subgroups: non-amnestic MCI (naMCI) (n=10) and amnestic MCI (aMCI) (n=42). The aMCI subgroup was further stratified into memory impairment of hippocampal type-hippocampal aMCI (HaMCI) (n=10) (potential preclinical AD) and isolated retrieval impairment-non-hippocampal (NHaMCI) (n=32). Results were compared to control (n=28) and AD (n=21) groups. We used the Hidden Goal Task, a human analogue of the Morris Water Maze, to examine spatial navigation either dependent (egocentric) or independent of individual's position (allocentric). Overall, the HaMCI group performed poorer on spatial navigation than the NHaMCI group, especially in the latter trials when the HaMCI group exhibited limited capacity to learn and the NHaMCI group exhibited a learning effect. Finally, the HaMCI group performed almost identically as the AD group. Spatial navigation deficit is particularly pronounced in individuals with hippocampus-related memory impairment and may signal preclinical AD."
"Drug addiction is a chronic disorder characterized by a relatively high rate of relapse even after long period of abstinence. In the present study, we used the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm to investigate the establishment, extinction, reinstatement and cross-reinstatement of nicotine-induced place conditioning in rats. Nicotine produced a place preference to the initially less-preferred compartment paired with its injections during conditioning (0.5mg/kg, i.p., three drug sessions). Once established, nicotine CPP was extinguished by repeated testing. Following this extinction phase, the reinstatement of CPP was investigated. Nicotine-experienced rats were challenged with nicotine (0.5mg/kg, i.p.) or morphine (10mg/kg, i.p.). These priming injections of both drugs induced a marked preference for the compartment previously paired with nicotine. Furthermore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist rimonabant (0.5, 1 and 2mg/kg, i.p.) in blocking the reinstatement of nicotine-induced CPP provoked by nicotine and morphine. It was shown that rimonabant attenuated the reinstatement of nicotine-conditioned response induced by both drugs. The outcome of our studies may suggest that CB1 receptor antagonists may become a promising target for effective pharmacotherapy of tobacco addiction and polydrug abuse."
"The postnatal day (P) 3 rat model of hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury provides valuable information regarding the cellular response to HI injury in a very immature brain. Our present study is the first to examine growth, metabolic, and behavioral outcomes following a P3 HI brain injury. Rats were injured by cauterizing the right common carotid, and exposure to 8% oxygen for 1.5h. Control rats received sham surgery and exposure to 1.5h of room air. One cohort of rats was examined for growth patterns through P33, evaluated using a battery of tests focused on early postnatal feeding behaviors, and studied using the open field paradigm during the early postnatal and postweaning periods. Another cohort of rats was used to examine metabolic parameters using indirect calorimetry. Significant growth deficits emerged in injured rats during the second postnatal week. No significant differences between groups were noted in the expression of feeding-related behaviors or in metabolic parameters between groups. However, we did observe significant associations between feeding-related behaviors and P14 growth parameters in injured rats. In the open field assessment, HI rats showed increased circling and supination behaviors only during the early postnatal period. Our data reveal that P3 HI brain injury results in generalized growth deficits that persist through postweaning. Analyses suggest that alterations in feeding-related behaviors contribute to growth deficits following a P3 HI brain injury."
"Schizophrenia is characterized by diverse behavioural and neurochemical abnormalities that may be differentially expressed in males and females. Male rats with neonatal ventral hippocampal lesions (nVHL) have commonly demonstrated behavioural and neurochemical abnormalities similar to those in schizophrenia. Fewer studies have used female rats. We investigated the hypothesis that male and female nVHL rats will demonstrate behavioural abnormalities accompanied by decreased GABA and l-glutamate release in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). On postnatal day (P) 7 rats received VH injections of ibotenate (3.0 microg/0.3 microl/side; n=18) or saline (n=21) or no injections (n=22). On P56, rats began water-maze, locomotor activity and elevated plus maze testing, and were then sacrificed for potassium-evoked GABA and l-glutamate release from PFC slices. nVHL rats showed impaired performance in water maze acquisition and match-to-sample tasks, increased spontaneous and amphetamine-induced locomotor activity and increased percent open-arm time. These behavioural changes were similar in males and females. These effects were accompanied by significantly reduced potassium-evoked l-glutamate release in male and female nVHL rats relative to controls, and non-significantly lower GABA release. Findings support the notion that behavioural abnormalities in post-pubertal male and female nVHL rats are associated with decreases in PFC neurotransmitter release."
"Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder whose etiology involves a mixture of genetic and environmental factors. By virtue of this complexity, schizophrenia is a field of research in which a number of key technologies converge: in particular, identification of putative susceptibility genes through association studies in clinical populations leads to investigation of the behavioural roles of these genes by targeted manipulation in mice and their phenotypic characterisation ('gene-driven' approach); in a complementary manner, identification of putative pathophysiological processes and therapeutic pathways leads to investigation of behavioural phenotype in mice mutant for genes regulating such processes and pathways ('phenotype-driven' approach). As several susceptibility genes for schizophrenia and numerous genes implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia have now been genetically manipulated in mice, it is timely to consider the roles of these genes in abnormal brain development and the ontogeny of putative schizophrenia-like phenotypes. The aim of this review is to outline existing knowledge from mutant studies concerning the contribution of these genes to the development of a common schizophrenia phenotype vis-&#xe0;-vis discrete schizophrenia endophenotypes. Emphasis is also placed on the importance of studying gene x environment and gene x gene interactions, as well as addressing methodological issues related to genetic modelling and phenotyping strategies."
"The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of food restriction (FR) and paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD), either alone or in combination, on sexual behaviours (mount, intromission and ejaculation) in adult male rats. Diet restriction began at weaning with 6g/day of food, and the amount of food was increased by 1g/week until it reached 15g/day amount (in adulthood). During adulthood, rats under FR and those fed ad libitum were either subjected to PSD for 96h or maintained in home-cage groups. The results indicated that both FR and ad libitum sleep-deprived groups showed a significant decrease in performance and motivation to initiate sexual behaviour, reflected by the increase in mount and intromission latencies and decreased copulatory rate. FR associated with PSD reversed the adverse effects of sleep deprivation on the number of ejaculations and inter-copulatory interval. Testosterone concentrations decreased after sleep deprivation, regardless of food availability; while progesterone was significantly higher in the FR-PSD group only. In light of the limited understanding of the link between secretion patterns and neural-hormonal control of food availability related to sexual behaviour, our data indicate that sleep loss affects sexual responses, and FR was able to restore some of the sexual parameters investigated."
"Previous experiments using progressive-delay schedules showed that destruction of the nucleus accumbens core (AcbC) altered rats' choice between food reinforcers differing in size and delay. Application of a quantitative model of inter-temporal choice suggested that lesions of the AcbC increase the delay-dependent degradation of reinforcer value (delay discounting) without altering instantaneous reinforcer value. This experiment examined the effect of lesions of the AcbC on inter-temporal choice using an adjusting-delay schedule. Rats received excitotoxin-induced lesions of the AcbC or sham lesions. They were trained to press levers A and B for food-pellet reinforcers in an adjusting-delay schedule in which the delay to the larger reinforcer, d(B), varied in accordance with the rats' choices between the two levers. In two experimental conditions, the reinforcers associated with levers A and B were 1 vs. 4 and 2 vs. 4 pellets. The AcbC-lesioned group showed shorter indifference delays to reinforcer B (d(B(50))) than the sham-lesioned group under both conditions. In confirmation of a prediction derived from the model of inter-temporal choice, the ratio of the indifference delays from the two conditions did not differ between the groups. Analysis of the cyclical changes in d(B) by Fourier transform showed that the period of oscillation and power within the dominant frequency band did not differ between the groups, suggesting that the lesion did not disrupt the rats' ability to detect short-term changes in delay of reinforcement. The results are consistent with previous findings that indicate a role for the AcbC in delay discounting."
"Ontogenetic modification of an early memory is relatively poorly understood. And an important question is whether the memory output is more determined by the age at acquisition or at retention? Here we explore the expression of odor-shock conditioning in the rat pup. Acquisition at post-natal day 6 (P6) leads to an approach response and at post-natal day 12 (P12) to an avoidance response when the retention test is 24h later. In both cases, anisomycin injected immediately post-acquisition induced a retrograde amnesia. Controls show that, in either case, short-term memory measured 4h after acquisition is not impaired and that anisomycin given after a 4h delay has no effect. Thus, at the two ages, memory involves a consolidation process. The main result is the spontaneous reversal of the conditioned response from approach acquired at P6 to avoidance when tested at P13. This phenomenon is robust as it is observed in three conditions. Moreover, amnesia induced at P6 is maintained at P13. Results are discussed in terms of maturation and/or competition of the memory traces."
"Symptoms of schizophrenia, commonly divided into positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive impairments, exhibit different sensitivity to pharmacological treatments. As such, they are typically modeled in animals by behavioral effects of drugs that evoke these symptoms in humans, such as amphetamine or phencyclidine (PCP). Despite the fact that muscarinic antagonists also evoke a schizophrenia-like syndrome (""antimuscarinic syndrome"") and findings of cholinergic-related alterations in brains of schizophrenia patients, modeling schizophrenia using muscarinic manipulations has been infrequently considered, and the effects of muscarinic blockade on behavioral tasks relevant to schizophrenia have not been adequately characterized. The present review surveys recent attempts to model schizophrenia-related symptoms using manipulations causing cholinergic dysfunction, particularly muscarinic blockade, in well validated behavioral models of schizophrenia, such as prepulse inhibition and latent inhibition."
"Adolescent exposure to anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) produces alterations to various neurochemical systems resulting in an elevated aggressive response. Both the GABAergic and dopaminergic neural systems are implicated in aggression control and are altered in the presence of AAS. The present studies provide a detailed report of the interaction between D2 receptors and GABAergic neurons in the lateral subdivision of the anterior hypothalamus (LAH), a brain region at the center of aggression control. Male Syrian hamsters were administered AAS throughout adolescence and their brains were processed for double-label immunofluorescence of GAD67 and D2 receptors. Results indicate an increase in the number of D2-ir and GAD67-ir cells in the LAH of AAS-treated animals. Although there were several cells in the LAH colocalized with both GAD67 and D2 receptors, there were no significant increases in the number of double-labeled GAD67/D2-ir neurons. Together, the data suggest the possibility of multiple GABAergic systems in the LAH allowing for differential inhibition of various neural systems. Given these changes in the number of GABAergic cells, it is likely that adolescent AAS exposure also alters the expression of GABAA receptors in brain areas innervated by the LAH. Thus, hamster brains were processed for immunohistochemistry and quantified for changes in GABAA-ir. Interestingly, adolescent exposure to AAS produced a significant decrease in the number of GABAA-ir elements in the LAH of aggressive hamsters. Taken together, results from the current studies provide a putative mechanism whereby dopamine stimulates aggression through removal of GABA inhibition in the LAH of AAS-treated animals."
"Dopamine transporter (DAT) plays a major role in terminating dopamine neurotransmission, which may be involved in the characterization of personality traits. Recently, polymorphisms of the promoter region (-67 A/T) and intron 8 (40-bp variable number of tandem repeats, VNTRs) in the DAT gene were reported to affect DAT expression. In the present study, we examined the associations of these polymorphisms with personality traits in 654 healthy Japanese. Personality traits were assessed by the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), and the DAT polymorphisms were identified by PCR-based methods. Regarding the -67 A/T promoter polymorphism, the females without the A allele predictive of high DAT activity had lower scores of self-directedness (p=0.005) and cooperativeness (p=0.038) than those with the A allele. In males, none of the TCI scores was different between the two genotype groups. The intron 8 VNTR polymorphism did not affect any TCI score either in males or in females. The present study thus suggests that the -67 A/T promoter polymorphism, but not intron 8 VNTR polymorphism, in the DAT gene affects personality traits of Japanese healthy females."
"One of the most widely used animal models for assessing recovery of locomotor functioning is the spinal rat. Although true differences in locomotor abilities of these animals are exhibited during treadmill testing, current measurement techniques often fail to detect them. The HiJK (Hillyer-Joynes Kinematics) scale was developed in an effort to distinguish more effectively between groups of spinal rats. Scale items were compiled after extensive review of the literature concerning development and analysis of rat locomotion and a thorough examination of the current tools. Treadmill tests for 137 Sprague-Dawley rats were taped and scored. The structure of the scale was tested with principle components and factor analysis, in which six of the eight items accounted for 59% of the variance, while all eight accounted for 78%. Validity tests demonstrate that HiJK is measuring locomotor performance accurately and powerfully. First, the HiJK scale correlates highly (&gt;.8) with the widely used BBB scale and second, as shown with ANOVA, can distinguish between different groups of spinal rats. Reliability of the scale was also analyzed. Cronbach's alpha was shown to be .91, indicating considerable internal consistency. Additionally, inter-rater and intra-rater reliabilities were substantial, with correlations for most items reaching above .80. We believe that the HiJK scale will help researchers verify existing experimental differences, advance the field of spinal cord research, and, hopefully, lead to discovery of methods to enhance recovery of function."
The pathogenesis of schizophrenia and related mental illnesses likely involves multiple interactions between susceptibility genes of small effects and environmental factors. Gene-environment interactions occur across different stages of neurodevelopment to produce heterogeneous clinical and pathological manifestations of the disease. The main obstacle for mechanistic studies of gene-environment interplay has been the paucity of appropriate experimental systems for elucidating the molecular pathways that mediate gene-environment interactions relevant to schizophrenia. Recent advances in psychiatric genetics and a plethora of experimental data from animal studies allow us to suggest a new approach to gene-environment interactions in schizophrenia. We propose that animal models based on identified genetic mutations and measurable environment factors will help advance studies of the molecular mechanisms of gene-environment interplay.
"An experiment was designed to automatically assess the relative level of social interaction during encounters involving trios of inbred mice consisting of two familiar cage mate males plus an unfamiliar third male. The automation of the spatial positioning was obtained by using a video-tracking program. In addition social behaviours were manually scored. To evaluate the influence of basic motor properties on the evaluation of the level of social interaction, we analysed two strains (C57BL/6J and 129S2/Sv) that are frequently employed in transgenic research, and show very different levels of motor activity. Correlations between manual and automated parameters showed that spatial parameters correctly fitted the level of social interaction between mice. In both strains C57BL/6J and 129S2/Sv, a proximity parameter (duration of bouts during which two individuals were close to each other) defined the social approach and correctly assessed the discrimination of social novelty."
"Wake-promoting effects of orexins and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) are well documented. Neuronal interactions between these two systems and anatomical data point to a reciprocal influence of these neuropeptides. We examined in how far an impaired CRH system may influence the circadian rhythm of extracellular orexin levels in mice. The basal levels of orexin were collected unilaterally from the lateral hypothalamus over 24 h in conditional CNS-specific CRH receptor type 1 (CRH-R1) knockout animals and control littermates. No significant differences were obtained between both groups suggesting that under basal conditions the circadian variation of hypothalamic orexin is not mediated by CRH, at least not via CRH-R1."
"The present study investigated potential antidepressant effect of light exposure in the dark phase of a 12:12 L/D cycle on behavioral despair. In Exp.1, male Wistar rats were administered a single, 10 min broadband light pulse (1300lx) either 3h (ZT15) or 9h (ZT21) after dark onset (ZT12) and tested in two consecutive swim tests separated by 24 h. Photic stimulation at ZT21 but not ZT15 significantly reduced immobility in the second swim test relative to the first test compared to controls that were treated similarly except for light pulse administration (p&lt;0.05). In Exp.2, groups were exposed to a single 10-min light pulse (1300lx) either in the blue or red end of the spectrum at ZT21 or were treated similarly except for photic exposure (controls). Exposure to blue light resulted in significantly reduced duration of immobility in the second swim test relative to that of the first test compared to the red light and control groups (p&lt;0.05). The present findings suggest a critical role in the antidepressant effect of blue light stimulation for the melanopsin-containing ganglion cells in the retina that are sensitive to wavelengths in the blue but not red end of the visible spectrum."
"Head-shake response (HSR) habituation was presently used to investigate the phenomena of spontaneous recovery and neural plasticity. Independent groups of rats were presented with five consecutive habituation sessions separated by inter-session intervals (ISIs) of 2, 24 or 72 h. At the conclusion of testing hippocampus and prefrontal cortex tissue samples were collected for determination of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3:stromelysin-1) expression as a marker of neural plasticity. The results indicated that by the fifth session the 2 h ISI group showed no spontaneous recovery, the 72 h ISI group revealed nearly complete spontaneous recovery; while the 24 h ISI group showed intermediate recovery. MMP-3 expression in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex was elevated in the 2 and 72 h ISI groups, but not in the 24 h group. A second experiment utilized 7-day osmotic pumps to intracerebroventricularly infuse an MMP-3 inhibitor for 6 days. The animals were then tested on the seventh day using the 2 h ISI protocol. Delivery of the MMP-3 inhibitor facilitated spontaneous recovery, thus compromising the animal's ability to appropriately habituate. This effect was accompanied by a significant inhibition of hippocampus and prefrontal cortex MMP-3 expression. These results suggest that elevations in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex MMP-3 expression contribute to this simplest form of learning and may be a mechanism underlying spontaneous recovery."
"Numerous methodological-related variables have been demonstrated to influence the baseline anxiety level of rodents exposed to the elevated plus-maze (EPM), raising questions about the sensitivity of this test for the detection of the effects of anxiolytic drugs. Thus, the present study was designed (1) to assess the combined effects of illumination (40-lx red or white light), closed wall type (walls made of translucent or opaque material) and extramaze space size (small or spacious experimental room) on rat behaviour, and (2) to investigate the effects of such parameters on the relevance of the maze for detecting the effects of diazepam orally administrated at the anxiolytic dose of 3 mg/kg. Results indicate that illumination and closed wall type are two main independent parameters that are able to modify the open arm avoidance. Moreover, the closed wall type interacts with the extramaze space size since the reduction of the open arm exploration induced by opaque closed walls is two-fold stronger in the spacious experimental room than in the small one. Finally, the diazepam anxiolytic activity is significantly detected in our laboratory in specific EPM conditions (maze with opaque walls, use of a red light, maze located in a spacious experimental room). In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that an inappropriate baseline anxiety level due to the methodological use of the EPM can dramatically reduce the sensitivity of the maze for the detection of benzodiazepine-related compounds. This study also provides new insights into the perception of the EPM open space in rats."
"There is a wealth of information indicating that the hippocampal formation is important for learning and memory consolidation. The hippocampus is very sensitive to ageing and developmentally stressful factors such as prenatal malnutrition, which produces anatomical alterations of hippocampal pyramidal cells as well as impaired spatial learning. On the other hand, there are no reports about differential effects of postnatal malnutrition, installed at birth and maintained all through life in young and aged rats, on learning and memory of active avoidance, a task with an important procedural component. We now report that learning and long-term retention of this task were impaired in young malnourished animals, but not in young control, senile control, and senile malnourished Sprague-Dawley rats; young and senile rats were 90 and 660 days of age, respectively. Extinction tests showed, however, that long-term memory of the malnourished groups and senile control animals is impaired as compared with the young control animals. These data strongly suggest that the learning and long-term retention impairments seen in the young animals were due to postnatal malnutrition; in the senile groups, this cognitive alteration did not occur, probably because ageing itself is an important factor that enables the brain to engage in compensatory mechanisms that reduce the effects of malnutrition. Nonetheless, ageing and malnutrition, conditions known to produce anatomic and functional hippocampal alterations, impede the maintenance of long-term memory, as seen during the extinction test."
"Repeated, prolonged maternal separation has been suggested to model the development of a depression-like syndrome in rats. The long separations from the pups have been proposed to be stressful for the dams, which in turn could mediate the changes seen in adult offspring. In the present study we investigated whether prolonged maternal separation really is stressful for rat dams by studying parameters known to be affected by long-term stress such as spontaneous motor activity, anxiety-like behaviour, adrenal gland weight and plasma corticosterone levels. Dams were separated from their litter for either 4 h (MS240) or 15 min (MS15) on eight random days during postnatal day 1-14, or left undisturbed (animal facility reared, AFR). After weaning MS240 dams showed decreased peripheral activity and habituated slower in horizontal activity. On the contrary, MS15 dams showed more peripheral activity and less rearing activity compared to both AFR and MS240 dams when habituated to the testing apparatus, suggesting that MS15 dams are more anxious. The adrenal glands from MS15 dams weighed significantly less and plasma corticosterone levels were significantly higher compared to AFR and MS240 dams. These results suggest that repeated brief maternal separations from pups could be stressful for rat mothers, whereas prolonged separations are not. Since these results are in contrast to the current notion that the short separation procedure may be considered as a safe milieu, whereas the prolonged separations have been suggested to be stressful for both dams and pups, further studies in this field are warranted."
"This study was designed to investigate an interaction between acute restraint stress and corticosterone with verapamil, a blocker of L-type voltage-dependent calcium (VDC) channels on retrieval of long-term memory. Young adult male rats were trained in one trial inhibitory avoidance task (0.5 mA, 3 s footshock). On retention test given 48 h after training, the latency to re-enter dark compartment of the apparatus was recorded. In Experiment 1, verapamil pretreatment (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg) enhanced the impairing effects of acute stress (which was applied for 10 min in a Plexiglass tube 30 min before the retention test) on memory retrieval. The applied stress increased circulating corticosterone levels as assessed immediately after the retention test, indicating that stress-induced impairment of memory retrieval is mediated, in part, by increased plasma levels of glucocorticoids. Verapamil did not change this response. In Experiment 2, pretreatment of an intermediate dose of verapamil also enhanced corticosterone-induced impairment of memory retrieval. In Experiments 3 and 4, acute stress or corticosterone did not change motor activity with or without prior treatment of verapamil, suggesting that stress or glucocorticoid-induced impairment of memory retrieval is not due to any gross disturbances in motor performance of animals. These findings indicate that blockade of L-type VDC channels enhances stress or glucocorticoid-induced impairment of memory retrieval, and provide evidence for the existence of an interaction between glucocorticoids and L-type VDC channels on memory retrieval."
"The defensive withdrawal test (DWT) is used to model anxiety-like behaviour in rats. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an aversive stimulus, bright light, affects the behaviour in this test. Additionally, the effect of habituation to the apparatus was studied. Both male and female Wistar rats were used to study whether sex differences exist in the DWT, as reported for other tests of anxiety. On day 1 half of the rats were tested under low light and half under bright light. Two to seven days after trial one the same rats were repeatedly tested under the same light condition for five consecutive days. The male rats showed a higher degree of anxiety-like behaviour when tested under bright light than under low light. In contrast, the behaviour of the female rats was not affected by changes in illumination. Male rats also exhibited elevated anxiety-like behaviour compared to female rats under bright light, whereas under low light conditions no sex difference was seen. Males in low light habituated much faster than males tested under bright light, whereas in females there was little difference in habituation between low and bright light. In summary, we found that bright light is aversive for male but not female Wistar rats in the DWT. Whether this is due to sex differences in light sensitivity or if females respond with a different behavioural strategy in response to bright light, which could not be detected in the DWT, remains to be elucidated."
"The forced swimming test (FST) is a widely used tool in the assessment of behavioral despair and prediction of response to antidepressants. However, the neural mechanisms underlying behavioral changes between pretest and test sessions of the FST remain unclear. In this study, we investigated changes in rat brain activity during the FST using [F-18]Fluorodeoxyglucose micro PET. In both pretest and test sessions, the activity of the cerebellum and striatum increased, whereas significant deactivation was observed in the hippocampus, inferior colliculus, orbital cortex, and insula. The periaqueductal gray (PAG) region activated markedly in the pretest session, but did not activate in the test session. There was a significant increase in immobility and a decrease in climbing during the behavioral analysis test session. These results suggest that the PAG region may play an important role in the modulation of FST coping strategies subsequent to failure of the escape response during the pretest session."
"Mutant mouse models related to schizophrenia have been based primarily on the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, the known effects of antipsychotic drugs, and candidate genes for schizophrenia. Sensorimotor gating deficits in schizophrenia patients, as indexed by measures of prepulse inhibition of startle (PPI), have been well characterized and suggested to meet the criteria as a useful endophenotype in human genetic studies. PPI refers to the ability of a non-startling ""prepulse"" to inhibit responding to the subsequent startling stimulus or ""pulse."" Because of the cross-species nature of PPI, it has been used primarily in pharmacological animal models to screen putative antipsychotic medications. As techniques in molecular genetics have progressed over the past 15 years, PPI has emerged as a phenotype used in assessing genetic mouse models of relevance to schizophrenia. In this review, we provide a selected overview of the use of PPI in mouse models of schizophrenia and discuss the contribution and usefulness of PPI as a phenotype in the context of genetic mouse models. To that end, we discuss mutant mice generated to address hypotheses regarding the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and candidate genes (i.e., hypothesis driven). We also briefly discuss the usefulness of PPI in phenotype-driven approaches in which a PPI phenotype could lead to ""bottom up"" approaches of identifying novel genes of relevance to PPI (i.e., hypothesis generating)."
"Voluntary physical activity improves memory and learning ability in rodents, whereas status epilepticus has been associated with memory impairment. Physical activity and seizures have been associated with enhanced hippocampal expression of BDNF, indicating that this protein may have a dual role in epilepsy. The influence of voluntary physical activity on memory and BDNF expression has been poorly studied in experimental models of epilepsy. In this paper, we have investigated the effect of voluntary physical activity on memory and BDNF expression in mice with pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. Male Swiss mice were assigned to four experimental groups: pilocarpine sedentary (PS), pilocarpine runners (PRs), saline sedentary (SS) and saline runners (SRs). Two days after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, the affected mice (PR) and their running controls (SR) were housed with access to a running wheel for 28 days. After that, the spatial memory and the expression of the precursor and mature forms of hippocampal BDNF were assessed. PR mice performed better than PS mice in the water maze test. In addition, PR mice had a higher amount of mature BDNF (14kDa) relative to the total BDNF (14kDa+28kDa+32kDa forms) content when compared with PS mice. These results show that voluntary physical activity improved the spatial memory and increased the hippocampal content of mature BDNF of mice with pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus."
"The incidence of psychiatric disturbances is elevated in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients. Early life stressful events are believed to have a major impact on mental health later in life, and increasing evidence suggests that such stresses may also promote a vulnerability to TLE. This study investigated whether subjecting rats to early life stress exacerbated mood and cognitive disturbances associated with the development of epilepsy. On postnatal days 2-14, rat pups were separated from their dams for either 180 min/day (handling and maternal separation--HMS180, modelling early life stress) or 15 min/day (control handling and maternal separation--HMS15). At 7 weeks, rats were implanted with a bipolar electrode into the left amygdala. Following recovery, one group of rats from each litter underwent rapid amygdala kindling (RAK) epileptogenesis, while another underwent sham kindling. One week following this, rats were subjected to behavioural tests assessing anxiety and cognition. HMS180-exposed rats kindled faster than HMS15 rats (p&lt;0.0001). RAK induced a potent anxiolytic effect as evidenced by increased % time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze, compared with sham kindled rats (p&lt;0.0001). This anxiolytic effect was also observed in the open field task, as evidenced by increased time spent in the inner area (p=0.010). Neither RAK nor maternal separation had any effect on cognitive function in the Morris water maze. We conclude that maternal separation stress accelerates limbic epileptogenesis in adult rats, and that RAK induces potent anxiolytic effects that are not influenced by such early life stressful events."
"Chronic stress induces dendritic atrophy in the inferior colliculus (IC, auditory mesencephalon) and impairs auditory avoidance conditioning. The aim of this study was to determine in Golgi preparations and in cued fear conditioning whether stress affects other auditory components, like the thalamic medial geniculate nucleus (MG) or the posterior thalamic nucleus (PO), in Sprague-Dawley rats. Chronic restraint stress produced a significant dendritic atrophy in the MG (stress: 407+/-55 microm; control: 808+/-120 microm; p&lt;0.01) but did not affect auditory fear conditioning. The last result was in apparent contrast with the fact that stress impairs both the acquisition of auditory avoidance conditioned responses and the dendritic structure in two major nuclei of the auditory system. In order to analyze this disagreement, we investigated whether the stress-related freezing to tone occurring in the fear conditioning protocol corresponded to a conditioned or an unconditioned fear response, using changes in tone instead of light throughout conditioning trials. Chronic stress significantly enhanced visual fear conditioning in stressed animals compared to controls (stress: 58.9+/-8.42%, control: 23.31+/-8.01%; p&lt;0.05), but this fear enhancement was related to unconditioned fear. Conversely, chronic stress did not affect the morphology of the PO (subserving both auditory and somatosensory information) or the corresponding auditory and somatosensory unconditioned responses (acoustic startle response and escape behavior). Our results suggest that the auditory conditioned stimulus can be processed in part independently of the IC and MG in the stressed animals, and sent to the amygdala via the PO inducing unconditioned fear. Comparable alterations could be produced in major depression."
"Peptide YY (PYY) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) have been proposed to participate in the control of energy homeostasis. Since these activities show circadian variations, we explored the circadian pattern of locomotor, exploratory and ingestive behaviour in male and/or female mice with disrupted genes for PYY (PYY-/-), NPY (NPY-/-) as well as PYY plus NPY (PYY+NPY-/-). The effect of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.1 mg/kg intraperitoneally) on these behaviours was also examined. The animals were housed singly in cages fitted with sensors for water and food intake and two infrared frames for recording ambulation and rearing under a 12 h light/dark cycle for 4 days. Locomotor and exploratory behaviour was decreased in female NPY-/- as well as male and female PYY+NPY-/- mice during the photo- and scotophase, and in male PYY-/- mice during the scotophase. Significant decreases in water and food intake were seen in female NPY-/- as well as male and female PYY+NPY-/- mice during the photophase. The effect of LPS to attenuate ingestive behaviour during the light and/or dark phase was most pronounced in PYY-/- and NPY-/- mice. These findings attest to a circadian cycle- and gender-related role of NPY and PYY in the control of behaviours that balance energy intake and energy expenditure. Both peptides stimulate feeding and drinking to balance the energy demand that they generate by enforcing the circadian pattern of locomotion and exploration. In addition, they counteract the anorectic and antidipsogenic effects of immune challenge."
"Peripheral lesions of the vestibular system have been associated with spatial memory deficits in animals and humans; however, no study to date has investigated the effects of such lesions on attention. In this study, we used a 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) to determine whether rats with bilateral vestibular deafferentation (BVD) had attention deficits at 5 months post-op. compared to sham controls. We found that BVD rats took longer than sham animals to reach the designated criterion of &gt;70% correct responses (P=0.006), they made significantly fewer correct responses (P=0.005), and significantly more incorrect responses (P=0.000), while showing no difference in omissions and premature responses and a significant decrease in perseverative responses (P=0.03). BVD rats also responded with a significantly shorter response latency, whether their response was correct (P=0.001) or incorrect (P=0.002), and obtained their reward for a correct response more quickly (P=0.000). These results suggest that rats with bilateral vestibular loss exhibit deficits on a 5-CSRTT that cannot be explained by an inability to respond and that their speed of response is altered."
"We previously discovered that corticosterone administration into the amygdala increases anxiety-like behaviors in rats tested on an elevated plus maze. However the behavioral effects of elevated corticosterone in a functionally related structure, the bed nuclei of stria terminalis (BNST) are unknown. The current study examined the effects of corticosterone administration into the dorsolateral BNST on exploratory behavior on an elevated plus maze. Corticosterone reduced open arm exploration on the plus maze indicating an increase in anxiety-like behavior."
"Zebrafish larvae have become a popular model system to examine genetic and environmental factors that affect behavior. However, studying complex behavior in large numbers of fish larvae can be challenging. The present study describes a novel high-resolution imaging system that is unique in its ability to automatically analyze the location and orientation of zebrafish larvae in multiwell plates. The system revealed behaviors in zebrafish larvae that would have been missed by more manual approaches, including a preference to face a threatening stimulus from a distance and a clockwise orientation in a two-fish assay. The clockwise orientation of the larvae correlates with a clockwise orientation of molecular structures during early development. Larvae with reversed embryonic asymmetries display a counter-clockwise orientation in the two-fish assay, suggesting that embryonic asymmetry and chiral behavior are regulated by the same developmental mechanisms. The developed imaging techniques may be used in large-scale screens to identify genes, pharmaceuticals, and environmental toxicants that influence complex behaviors."
"In contrast to adult lesions, which usually result in immediate functional deficits, neonatal lesions of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) in rats can be compensated to some extent by functional tissue during ontogeny with sparing of function in many aspects. In this study, we examined the effects of a neonatal ibotenic acid lesion of the medial PFC on trace conditioning in adult rats, a form of classical conditioning. Since the PFC is also part of the neuroendocrine stress regulation, we additionally investigated the effects of chronic pubertal corticosterone treatment on trace conditioning to test the hypothesis that early lesions render the brain vulnerable to stress-like conditions in later life. Although there was considerable regeneration of much of the lesioned tissue in the medial PFC, a disruption of cortical layering and cortical thinning was observed in the adult brain. The chronic corticosterone treatment led to a decrease of corticosterone blood serum levels and reduced adrenal weights. Neither the neonatal lesion nor the corticosterone treatment alone affected trace conditioning; however, in rats that had received both treatments trace conditioning was impaired, suggesting synergistic effects between the lesion and the glucocorticoid treatment. An interaction between two adverse events that occur at different life stages complies with neurodevelopmental theories for some psychiatric diseases like schizophrenia."
"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder, for which no known cure or effective treatment exists. To facilitate the search for new potential treatments of HD, an automated system for analyzing the behavior of transgenic HD mice is urgently needed. A recently developed behavior screening system, the IntelliCage, allows automated testing of mouse behavior in the home cage employing individual recognition of animals living in social groups. The present study validates the ability of the IntelliCage system to detect behavioral and cognitive dysfunction in R6/2 mice, an established transgenic model of HD. The results indicate that the IntelliCage is a reliable system for recording exploratory activity, drinking behavior, circadian rhythm, spatial preference, and cognition in mice during prolonged periods of assessment. The system detected early dysfunctional behaviors in R6/2 mice, such as decrease in exploratory activity, sleep disturbances, increased drinking, and repetitive behavior. Additionally, the use of various learning tasks, such as spatial avoidance and spatial patrolling, revealed early cognitive changes in R6/2 mice. The simple learning tasks may be used at both early and late stages of the disease."
"Acute injections of 8mg/kg of 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (l-DOPA) or 0.05mg/kg rimonabant equally improved contralateral forepaw stepping in rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions, and their combination improved stepping more than either drug alone. However, 0.05mg/kg rimonabant did not alter the changes in stepping produced by acute injections of a dyskinesic dose of 35mg/kg l-DOPA. Thus, not only is a cannabinoid antagonist monotherapeutic in this animal model of Parkinson's disease, but it also enhances the therapeutic effect of a moderate, but not a high, dose of l-DOPA."
"Sustained attention is defined as the ability or capacity to remain focused on the occurrence of rare events over long periods of time. We describe here the development of a novel, operant-based attention task that can be learned by mice in 8-10 days. Mice were trained on a 2-choice visual discrimination task in an operant chamber, wherein the correct response on any given trial was a lever-press cued by a stimulus light. Upon reaching a criterion of greater than 80% correct responses, all subjects were tested in a mixed-trial attention paradigm combining four different stimulus durations within a single session (0.5, 1, 2, or 10 s). During attention testing, the percentage of correct responses decreased as a function of stimulus duration, indicating a performance decrement which parallels increasing attentional demand within the task. Pretreatment with the muscarinic-receptor antagonist scopolamine yielded a reliable, dose-dependent performance deficit whereas nicotine treatment improved the percentage of correct responses during trials with the greatest attentional demand. Moreover, medial prefrontal cortex lesions impaired attention performance without affecting acquisition or retention of the discrimination rule. These results underscore the utility of this task as a novel means of assessing attentional processes in mice in a relatively high-throughput manner."
"Non-copulators (NC) are normal males that fail to display sexual behavior, we evaluate if NC male rats have a functional general reward system. NC male rats were injected with morphine to determine if a reward state, as evaluated by the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm, could be induced. Our results demonstrate that NC males develop CPP to a morphine injection, indicating that their general reward system is functional."
"We studied the effects of variations in maternal environment on maternal behaviour and offspring memory in mice by exposing lactating C57BL/6J dams to predator cues and/or environmental enrichment. At 10 weeks of age, object recognition memory in the offspring was assessed. The presence of enrichment in the maternal environment had no effect on offspring memory. In contrast, female offspring of dams that were not exposed to predator cues displayed a significant preference for the novel object (p=0.05) and a significantly higher preference score (PS) than female offspring of dams that were exposed to predator cues (F=4.23, p=0.05) indicating an impairment in object recognition memory in the latter. Conversely, there was no evidence of object recognition memory in male offspring, except for males of dams exposed to predator cues without shelter (p=0.03). These effects can be explained by an interaction between variations in maternal care and the stressfulness of the rearing conditions since a regression analysis revealed an inverse relationship between the level of licking-grooming and the PS, but only in female offspring reared by dams exposed to the predator cues (beta=-0.96, p=0.001). The present findings thus provide some evidence that early rearing conditions may affect cognitive abilities of mice. The data also suggest that these effects may be sex-specific, and that females may be more sensitive to early environmental variations than males."
"We examined whether and how deictic gestures and words influence each other when the content of the gesture was congruent or incongruent with that of the simultaneously produced word. Two experiments were carried out. In Experiment 1, the participants read aloud the deictic word 'QUA' ('here') or 'LA"" ('there'), printed on a token placed near to or far from their body. Simultaneously, they pointed towards one's own body, when the token was placed near, or at a remote position, when the token was placed far. In this way, participants read 'QUA' ('here') and pointed towards themselves (congruent condition) or a remote position (incongruent condition); or they read 'LA"" ('there') and pointed towards a remote position (congruent condition) or themselves (incongruent condition). In a control condition, in which a string of 'X' letters was printed on the token, the participants were silent and only pointed towards themselves (token placed near) or a remote position (token placed far). In Experiment 2, the participants read aloud the deictic word placed in the near or far position without gesturing. The results showed that the congruence/incongruence between the content of the deictic word and that of the gesture affected gesture kinematics and voice spectra. Indeed, the movement was faster in the congruent than in the control and incongruent conditions; and it was slower in the incongruent than in the control condition. As concerns voice spectra, formant 2 (F2) decreased in the incongruent conditions. The results suggest the existence of a bidirectional interaction between speech and gesture production systems."
"Deficits in N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function play a critical role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Animal models are needed to investigate possible mechanisms underlying NMDA dysfunction in schizophrenia as well as development of new therapeutic approaches. A major difficulty in developing animal models for schizophrenia is the identification of quantifiable measures that can be tested in a similar fashion in both humans and animals. The majority of animal models utilize analogous measures, wherein species-specific behaviors are used as presumed parallel manifestations of a common underlying construct. In vivo microdialysis and electrophysiology represent two methodologies in which homologous measures can instead be obtained in both animals and humans. In both techniques, well-validated, NMDA-sensitive measures are analyzed in rodents using probes implanted directly into cortex or subcortical structures. We discuss the currently available data from studies that used these methods in non-human primate and rodent glutamate models. In addition, we emphasize the possible relevance of the amphetamine-challenge studies to positive symptoms and of EEG measures to cognitive deficits in schizophrenia."
"Among a range of genetic mouse models of Huntington's disease, knock-in models that express full-length mutant huntingtin tend to have a slower developing and less severe behavioural phenotype than transgenic models carrying truncated variations of the human gene; as a result, these more subtle full-length knock-in models have been relatively neglected for behavioural and therapeutic studies. In the current study, we show that full-length knock-in Hdh(Q92) mice exhibit marked impairments at a relatively young age in delayed alternation, a cognitive test conducted in 9-hole operant chambers classically associated with prefrontal and corticostriatal function. Additional tests of motivation, visuomotor and rotarod performance were undertaken to determine the frontal-like specificity of the impairment; aspects of sensorimotor and motivational as well as cognitive performance were deficient in Hdh(Q92/Q92) mice in comparison with their wildtype littermates by 27 months of age. The present results demonstrate that Hdh(Q92/Q92) mice do exhibit clear impairments on a range of sensory, motor, motivational and cognitive tests, provided appropriate sensitive tasks are used."
"Across mammalian species, comparable morphological and physiological constraints in the production of airborne vocalisations are suggested to lead to commonalities in the vocal conveyance of acoustic features to specific attributes of callers, such as arousal and individual identity. To explore this hypothesis we examined intra- and interindividual acoustic variation in chatter calls of tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri). The calls were induced experimentally by a disturbance paradigm and related to two defined arousal states of a subject. The arousal state of an animal was primarily operationalised by the habituation of the subject to a new environment and additionally determined by behavioural indicators of stress in tree shrews (tail-position and piloerection). We investigated whether the arousal state and indexical features of the caller, namely individual identity and sex, are conveyed acoustically. Frame-by-frame videographic and multiparametric sound analyses revealed that arousal and identity, but not sex of a caller reliably predicted spectral-temporal variation in sound structure. Furthermore, there was no effect of age or body weight on individual-specific acoustic features. Similar results in another call type of tree shrews and comparable findings in other mammalian lineages provide evidence that comparable physiological and morphological constraints in the production of airborne vocalisations across mammals lead to commonalities in acoustic features conveying arousal and identity, respectively."
"Rats were tested on a hippocampus dependent win-shift working memory task in familiar or novel environments after receiving bilateral ventral tegmental area infusions of baclofen. Baclofen infusion disrupted working memory performance in both familiar and novel environments. In addition, baclofen infusion selectively disrupted short-term working memory in the novel environment. This experiment confirms selective ventral tegmental area support of accurate performance during a context dependent spatial navigation task."
"Traditional evaluation of pain in animals has primarily used reflexive withdrawal or nocifensive response from singly presented stimulation. However, daily experience of thermal sensation involves situations in which rapid temperature changes from cold to hot can occur. Therefore, in order to better understand integration of competing stimuli and their role in the motivational character of pain perception, behavioral tasks have been adapted to evaluate treatment-driven changes in hindpaws when exposed to two or more stimuli. However, such assessments of craniofacial sensitivity are lacking. In this study, we sought to characterize thermal preference for facial stimulation when rats are given the option of experiencing a hot or cold stimulus to obtain a milk reward, or abstaining from stimulation. We found that when both cold and hot stimuli were either non-noxious or where both stimuli were noxious the hot stimulus was preferred. When the hot stimulus was noxious, non-noxious cold was preferred. Unstimulated time was dependent on the combined aversiveness of the two stimuli, such that unstimulated time was the greatest with a highly aversive stimulus pair (-4 and 48 degrees C). We also found that pairing stimuli modulated successful task completion for each stimulus, but for nociceptive heat, this was not solely a consequence of thermal preference. Finally, we found that previous preference could both induce and abolish subsequent thermode preference independent of stimulus cues. The findings in this study will allow us to evaluate experimental pain states and analgesic treatments in a manner more relatable to the experience of the patient."
"Recent anatomical and clinical evidence has shown that the cerebellum, primarily considered a motor control structure, is also involved in higher cognitive functions and behavioural changes, such as impulsive behaviour. Impulsive behaviour has been shown in several studies to be increased by lesions of the mediodorsal (MD) thalamic nucleus. We performed deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the mediodorsal and ventrolateral (VL) thalamic nuclei in rats, clinically mimicking such a lesion, and tested them for changes in impulsive behaviour in a choice reaction time test. We then analysed the effects of this stimulation on c-Fos expression in both the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCbN) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and correlated these outcomes to the measured changes in impulsive behaviour. DBS of the MD thalamic nucleus increased impulsive behaviour without changing motor parameters. This was accompanied by a decrease in the c-Fos expression in all cerebellar nuclei; with a corresponding increase in c-Fos expression in the PFC. DBS of the VL thalamic nucleus caused no significant change in behaviour or c-Fos expression in either region. The present study demonstrates that impulsive behaviour involves the cerebellar nuclei, possibly through a decreased selective attention caused by a disruption of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways through the MD thalamic nucleus."
"The potential neuroleptic-like effect of ampullosporin A, a new peptaibol, isolated from the fungus Sepedonium ampullosporum HKI-0053, was characterized using specific behavioural models and methods. Ampullosporin A (amp) disrupted the retrieval of a well-trained conditioned reaction and normalized the behavioural effects of subchronic ketamine treatment in the social interaction test in a dose which showed only inconsiderable side effects. The experiments demonstrated that the substance did not antagonize the apomorphine (apo) induced hyperactivity. On the other hand, the locomotor stimulation induced by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 was nearly completely suppressed by ampullosporin A, supposing interactions with the glutamatergic system. Binding studies demonstrated no interaction with dopaminergic D(1) and D(2) receptors. However, amp can alter the activity of glutamate receptors. The results resemble characteristics of an atypical neuroleptic drug. But further experiments are necessary to validate the suggested neuroleptic-like activity."
"Typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol exert their therapeutic effects via blockade of dopamine (DA) D(2) receptors, leading to extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in humans and catalepsy in rodents. In contrast, atypical antipsychotics and new generation D(2)/5-HT(1A) antipsychotics have low cataleptogenic potential. However, there has been no systematic comparative study on the effects of these different classes of antipsychotics in non-human primates, a species displaying a more sophisticated repertoire of behavioural/motor activity than rats. Once weekly, six young adult female non-haloperidol-sensitised cynomolgus monkeys were treated i.m. with a test compound and videotaped to score catalepsy-associated behaviour (CAB: static postures, unusual positions and crouching). Haloperidol, risperidone, olanzapine, nemonapride and remoxipride induced, to different extents, an increase in unusual positions (a response akin to dystonia), some crouching and static postures. In contrast, clozapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone and aripiprazole produced much lower or no unusual positions; clozapine also produced marked increases in static postures and crouching. Among novel D(2)/5-HT(1A) antipsychotics, SLV313 and F15063 augmented the number of unusual positions, albeit at doses 16-63 times higher than those of haloperidol for approximately the same score. SSR181507 and bifeprunox produced moderate static postures, little crouching and negligible unusual positions. These data provide the first comparative analysis in cynomolgus monkeys of EPS liability of conventional, atypical and novel D(2)/5-HT(1A) antipsychotics. They indicate that the latter are less prone than haloperidol to produce CAB, and provide a basis for comparison with rodent catalepsy studies."
"Chronic alcohol intake is known to induce the selective neuronal damage associated with increase oxidative-nitrosative stress and activation of inflammatory cascade finally resulting in neuronal apoptosis and thus dementia. In the present study, we investigated the comparative effect of both the isoforms of vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol and tocotrienol against chronic alcohol-induced cognitive dysfunction in rats. Male Wistar rats were given ethanol (10g/kg; oral gavage) for 10 weeks, and treated with alpha-tocopherol and tocotrienol for the same duration. The learning and memory behavior was assessed using Morris water maze and elevated plus maze test. The rats were sacrificed at the end of 10th week and cytoplasmic fractions of cerebral cortex and hippocampus were prepared for the quantification of acetylcholinesterase activity, oxidative-nitrosative stress parameters, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). From the 6th week onwards, ethanol-treated rats showed significant increase in transfer latency in both the behavioral paradigms which was coupled with enhanced acetylcholinesterase activity, increased oxidative-nitrosative stress, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels in different brain regions of ethanol-treated rats. Co-administration of alpha-tocopherol as well as tocotrienol significantly and dose-dependently prevented these behavioral, biochemical and molecular changes in the brains of ethanol-treated rats. However, the effects were more pronounced with tocotrienol. The current study thus demonstrates the possible involvement of oxidative-nitrosative stress mediated activation of inflammatory cascade in chronic alcohol-induced cognitive dysfunction and also suggests the effectiveness of vitamin E isoforms, of which tocotrienol being more potent, in preventing the cognitive deficits associated with chronic alcohol consumption."
"Independent studies have shown that the median raphe nucleus (MRN) and dorsal hippocampus (DH) are involved in the expression of contextual conditioned fear (CFC). However, studies that examine the integrated involvement of serotonergic mechanisms of the MRN-DH are lacking. To address this issue, a CFC paradigm was used to test whether the serotonergic projections from the MRN to DH can influence CFC. Serotoninergic drugs were infused either into the MRN or DH prior to testing sessions in which freezing and startle responses were measured in the same context where 6h previously rats received footshocks. A reduction of serotonin (5-HT) transmission in the MRN by local infusions of the 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) decreased freezing in response to the context but did not reduce fear-potentiated startle. This pattern of results is consistent with the hypothesis that MRN serotonergic mechanisms selectively modulate the freezing response to the aversive context. As for the DH, a decrease in postsynaptic 5-HT receptor activity at projection areas has been proposed to be the main consequence of 5-HT(1A) receptor activation in the MRN. Intra-DH injections of 8-OH-DPAT inhibited both the freezing and fear-potentiated startle response to the context. To reconcile these findings, an inhibitory mechanism may exist between the incoming 5-HT pathway from the MRN to DH and the neurons of the DH output to other structures. The DH-amygdala or medial prefrontal cortex projections could well be this output circuit modulating the expression of CFC as revealed by measurements of Fos immunoreactivity in these areas."
"The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) has been implicated in both inflammatory processes and nociceptive neurotransmission. Activation of P2X7 receptors is the mechanism by which ATP stimulates the rapid maturation and release of IL-1beta from macrophages and microglial cells. Recently, selective P2X7 receptor antagonists have been shown to reduce inflammatory and neuropathic pain in animal models. However, the mechanisms underlying these analgesic effects are unknown. The present studies characterize the pharmacology and antinociceptive effects of a structurally novel P2X7 antagonist. A-839977 potently (IC50=20-150 nM) blocked BzATP-evoked calcium influx at recombinant human, rat and mouse P2X7 receptors. A-839977 also potently blocked agonist-evoked YO-PRO uptake and IL-1beta release from differentiated human THP-1 cells. Systemic administration of A-839977 dose-dependently reduced thermal hyperalgesia produced by intraplantar administration of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) (ED50=100 micromol/kg, i.p.) in rats. A-839977 also produced robust antihyperalgesia in the CFA model of inflammatory pain in wild-type mice (ED50=40 micromol/kg, i.p.), but the antihyperalgesic effects of A-839977 were completely absent in IL-1alphabeta knockout mice. These data demonstrate that selective blockade of P2X7 receptors in vivo produces significant antinociception in animal models of inflammatory pain and suggest that the antihyperalgesic effects of P2X7 receptor blockade in an inflammatory pain model in mice are mediated by blocking the release of IL-1beta."
"Maternal undernutrition during pregnancy alters the physiology, behaviour and cognitive abilities of the offspring in sheep. Undernutrition restricted to the time around conception alters the physiology of the offspring, but effects on the behaviour and cognitive abilities are unknown. We studied the effects of mild periconceptional undernutrition in sheep on side preference and cognitive flexibility in the offspring. Ewes were well fed (controls) or mildly undernourished from 60 days before until 30 days after mating (PCUN; 10-15% body weight reduction). Offspring were evaluated at 4 and 18 months of age in a left-right choice maze using social and feeding motivation as rewards. We determined side preference, and assessed cognitive flexibility as the ability to improve runs required to reach criterion during two reversal learning episodes. Side preference in the PCUN offspring was close to neutrality in singleton males (p &lt; or = 0.05) and twin females (p &lt; or = 0.05) at 4 but not 18 months of age. Twin offspring tended to be more likely to change side preference between 4 and 18 months (p=0.07). Performance on reversal learning was similar in PCUN and control offspring, but speed of learning improved faster in female than in male lambs (p &lt; or = 0.05) at 4 but not 18 months of age. These findings suggest that mild periconceptional undernutrition in sheep can alter behavioural laterality of the offspring, and that singleton/twin status, sex and postnatal age are all important factors to consider in evaluating the effects of prenatal insults on postnatal behaviour."
"Aged heterozygous Rolling Nagoya mice carrying Cav2.1alpha1 mutation show deficits with regard to spatial short-term memory using hippocampus-related object location test, but not with regard to nonspatial memory using perirhinal cortex-related object recognition test. In hippocampus, wild-type Cav2.1alpha1 mRNA exhibited lower expression and mutant-type expression was higher in aged heterozygous mice. In perirhinal cortex, there were no significantly different expressions. Alteration of age-dependent expressions of Cav2.1 channels differs in different regions with related effects on behavioral performances."
"Impulsivity or diminished inhibitory control of behavior (impulse control) is a prominent feature of several neuropsychiatric diseases. Serotonin (5-HT) plays an important role in impulse control. In order to examine the role of 5-HT2 receptors in a network comprising the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in impulse control, the present study investigated effects of local infusions of the 5-HT2 receptor ligands DOI [(+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropan hydrochloride] and ketanserin on the performance of rats in the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT). Simultaneous bilateral infusion of the 5-HT(2A/C) receptor agonist DOI (5 microg/0.3 microl) into the OFC and the BLA significantly increased impulsive responding in the 5-CSRTT. These data suggest that both the OFC and the BLA are implicated in the mediation of DOI-induced impulsivity in the 5-CSRTT. Furthermore, these data support the notion that impulsivity caused by excessive 5-HT receptor stimulation is not mediated by just one particular brain structure, but rather by additive effects in at least two cortico-limbic structures, or perhaps by interactions of different transmitter systems within forebrain circuits."
"The assessment of learning and memory in animal models has been widely employed in scientific research for a long time. Among these models, those representing diseases with primary processes of affected memory - such as amnesia, dementia, brain aging, etc. - studies dealing with the toxic effects of specific drugs, and other exploring neurodevelopment, trauma, epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders, are often called on to employ these tools. There is a diversity of experimental methods assessing animal learning and memory skills. Overall, mazes are the devices mostly used today to test memory in rodents; there are several types of them, but their real usefulness, advantages and applications remain to be fully established and depend on the particular variant selected by the experimenter. The aims of the present article are first, to briefly review the accumulated knowledge in regard to spatial memory tasks; second, to bring the reader information on the different types of rodent mazes available to test spatial memory; and third, to elucidate the usefulness and limitations of each of these devices."
"We investigated the effects of a neurorestorative treatment paradigm using long-term, central delivery of growth hormone (GH) starting 4 days after stroke. It has been shown previously that a neural GH axis is activated after stroke, that GH is neuroprotective, and can have direct trophic actions on neurons and stem cells. First, we developed and validated a buffer that kept rat GH bioactive for 2 weeks at body temperature. Implanted minipumps were used to chronically infuse GH into the lateral ventricle of unilateral stroke injured adult rats. Initially, a dose ranging pilot study was used to characterize the neuroendocrine effects and distribution of the infused GH. Next, a 6-week treatment trial starting 4 days after induction of the stroke was performed and the animals allowed to recover for a further 6 weeks. Behavioural and endocrinological measures were taken. We found that the infused GH localized to cells within the ipsilateral; subventricular zone, white matter tract, lesion and penumbral regions. GH treatment accelerated recovery of one out of three tests of motor function (P&lt;0.001) and improved spatial memory on the Morris water maze test at the end of the study (P&lt;0.05), with no effect on learning. We also found that GH treatment was associated with a reversible increase in body weight (P&lt;0.01) whilst circulating IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) levels were halved (P&lt;0.001). Delayed and chronic treatment of stroke with central GH may accelerate some aspects of functional recovery and improve spatial memory in the long-term."
"Dopamine (DA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors seem to be critically involved in working memory processing in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Effects of NMDA receptors blockade on dopamine D1 receptors activation in the mPFC on spatial working memory was investigated. Adult male Wistar rats, well trained in an eight-arm radial maze and bilaterally cannulated in the mPFC, received intracortical administrations of saline (SAL) or SKF-38393 (DA D1 receptor agonist) followed, 10 min later, by MK-801 (non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist). They were tested in 1 h delayed tasks after 5 min of the second administration. SKF-38393 (0.56 and 1.8 microg) was disruptive to working memory, increasing significantly the number of errors in the 1 h post-delay performance when administered into the mPFC. MK-801, at doses with no significant effects alone (0.32 or 1.0 microg), reduced significantly the disruptive effect of 0.56 microg SKF-38393. These results showed that the disruptive effect of DA D(1) receptors activation in the mPFC on working memory was significantly reduced by an open-channel NMDA receptor blockade, suggesting that the processing of working memory in the mPFC involving DA D1 receptors depend, at least in part, of NMDA receptors activity in this cortical area."
"1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPhtCho) (1 microM) enhanced long-term depression (LTD), a synaptic plasticity relevant to learning and memory, in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices, where expression of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit GluR1 on the plasma membrane was decreased. In the water maze test, oral administration with POPhtCho (5 mg/kg) significantly shortened the prolonged retention latency for rats intraperitoneally injected with scopolamine (1 mg/kg), while the acquisition latency was not affected. For humans with mild cognitive impairment and dementia (average of Mini Mental State Examination score, 18), oral intake with POPhtCho (300 mg/day, once after breakfast) everyday raised the score to over 20, corresponding to normal cognitive functions, throughout 6 months after intake. The results of the present study, thus, indicate that POPhtCho could ameliorate cognitive disorders, possibly by enhancing LTD."
"The current study examined whether modafinil would reinstate an extinguished cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP). Following extinction of a cocaine CPP, rats were administered modafinil (128 mg/kg), cocaine (5 mg/kg) or vehicle and given a 60-min reinstatement test. While the effect of cocaine was transient, modafinil robustly reinstated a cocaine CPP following extinction, suggesting that modafinil may induce relapse or increase the vulnerability of addicts to the reinforcing effects of environmental triggers."
"Estrogen deficiency has been associated with stress, anxiety and depression. Estrogen receptors have been identified in the median raphe nucleus (MRN). This structure is the main source of serotonergic projections to the hippocampus, a forebrain area implicated in the regulation of defensive responses and in the resistance to chronic stress. There is reported evidence indicating that estrogen modulates 5-HT1A receptor function. In the MRN, somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors control the activity of serotonergic neurones by negative feedback. The present study has evaluated the effect of intra-MRN injection of estradiol benzoate (EB, 600 or 1200 ng/0.2 microl) on the performance of ovariectomized rats submitted to contextual conditioning. Additionally, the same treatment was given after intra-MRN injection of Way 100635 (100 ng/0.2 microl), a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. Both doses of EB decreased freezing and increased rearing, indicating an anxiolytic effect. Pretreatment with Way 100635 antagonized the anxiolytic effect of estradiol. On the basis of these results, it may be suggested that estrogens modulate anxiety by acting on 5-HT1A receptors localized in the MRN."
"Chronic psychosocial stress has been suggested as ""second hit"" in the etiology of neuropsychiatric disease, but experimental evidence is scarce. We employed repetitive social defeat stress in juvenile mice, housed individually or in groups, and measured sensorimotor gating by pre-pulse inhibition (PPI), a marker of neuronal network function. Using the resident-intruder paradigm, 28-day old C57BL/6NCrl mice were subjected daily for 3 weeks to social defeat. PPI and basic behaviour were analyzed 10 weeks later. Whereas stress increased the level of anxiety in all animals, persistent PPI deficits were found only in individually housed mice. Thus, social support in situations of severe psychosocial stress may prevent lasting impairment in basic information processing."
"Malnourished rats since birth (mothers fed on 6% of protein) or controlled ones (16% of protein), half of each group received environmental stimulation (ES) from the age of 0-35th day, were studied. The performance in the elevated plus maze (EPM) was assessed on the last day. ES increased time spent and also the entries into open arms of EPM, but malnourished non-stimulated rats visited more segments near the central area than the distant ones. Data suggests an anxiolytic effect of ES which is less evident in malnourished rats."
"Antagonists of group I metabotropic receptors exhibit anxiolytic action in adult rats. In immature animals we demonstrated anticonvulsant action of MPEP and AIDA, antagonists of group 5 and group 1, respectively. However, there are no developmental data on anxiolytic-like and learning actions of both compounds. This study investigated whether the anticonvulsant dose range of MPEP and AIDA affects anxiety-like behavior and learning ability in immature rats. Animals at 12, 18 and 25 postnatal (P) days received MPEP in doses of 10, 20 or 40 mg/kg i.p., AIDA in doses of 10 or 20 mg/kg i.p. In P18 and P25 rats anxiety-like behavior and locomotor activity were tested in the light-dark box and open-field test at 15 (1st session) and 60 (2nd session) minutes after drug administration. Learning ability of P12, P18, and P25 animals was examined in the homing response test 15 min after drug administration. Both antagonists exhibited anxiolytic-like action in the 1st session, effects in the 2nd session were less marked. In the open-field test both antagonists increased locomotion only in P18 animals. Age-dependent changes were found in the homing response test, the return latency being longer only in P12 animals. While MPEP in doses of 20- and 40-mg/kg in P12 and 40-mg/kg in P18 rats prolonged the homing response, AIDA did not affect the homing behavior. Both MPEP and AIDA exert anxiolytic-like effect also in immature rats. Except for the youngest animals no changes in learning ability in the homing response test were found."
"We have recently shown that morphine withdrawal sensitizes the neural substrates of fear in the midbrain tectum structures--the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) and inferior colliculus (IC). In the present study, we investigated the role of mu- and kappa-opioid receptors in the mediation of these effects. Periadolescent rats chronically treated with morphine (10 mg/kg; s.c.) twice daily for 10 days were implanted with an electrode glued to a guide-cannula into the dPAG or the IC. Forty-eight hours after the interruption of this treatment, the effects of intra-dPAG or intra-IC microinjections of [D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO; 0.6 and 1 nmol/0.2 microl)--a selective mu-receptor agonist--or nor-binaltorphimine (BNI; 2.5 and 5 microg/0.2 microl)--a selective kappa-receptor antagonist with tardive action--on the freezing and escape thresholds determined by electrical stimulation of the dPAG and the IC were examined. For both structures, morphine withdrawal produced pro-aversive effects. DAMGO and BNI had antiaversive effects when injected into the dPAG and IC of non-dependent rats. In morphine-withdrawn rats, only BNI continued to promote antiaversive effects in both structures. Whereas DAMGO lost its antiaversive efficacy when injected into the dPAG, only its highest dose promoted antiaversive effects in the IC of morphine-withdrawn rats, suggesting the development of an apparent tolerance. Thus, the enhanced reactivity of the midbrain tectum in morphine-withdrawn periadolescent rats may be due, at least partially, to an impairment of the inhibitory influence of mechanisms mediated by mu-receptors on the neural substrates of fear in this region."
"The biological regulating factors of physical activity in animals are not well understood. This study investigated differences in the central mRNA expression of seven dopamine genes (Drd1, Drd2, Drd3, Drd4, Drd5, TH, and DAT) between high active C57/LJ (n=17) male mice and low active C3H/HeJ (n=20) male mice, and between mice with access to a running wheel and without running wheel access within strain. Mice were housed with running wheels interfaced with a computer for 21 days with distance and duration recorded every 24 h. On day 21, the striatum and nucleus accumbens were removed during the active period (approximately 9 pm) for dopaminergic analysis. On average, the C57L/J mice with wheels ran significantly farther (10.25+/-1.37 km/day vs. 0.01+/-0.09 km/day, p&lt;0.001), longer (329.73+/-30.52 min/day vs. 7.81+/-6.32 min/day, p&lt;0.001), and faster (31.27+/-3.13 m/min vs. 11.81+/-1.08 m/min, p&lt;0.001) than the C3H/HeJ mice with wheels over the 21 day period. No differences in gene expression were found between mice in either strain with wheels and those without wheels suggesting that access to running wheels did not alter dopaminergic expression. In contrast, relative expression for two dopamine genes was significantly lower in the C57L/J mice compared to the C3H/HeJ mice. These results indicate that decreased dopaminergic functioning is correlated with increased activity levels in C57L/J mice and suggests that D1-like receptors as well as tyrosine hydroxylase (an indicator of dopamine production), but not D2-like receptors may be associated with the regulation of physical activity in inbred mice."
"Low dose apomorphine treatments preferentially activate dopamine autoreceptors and inhibit dopamine neurons as well as behavior. In contrast, high doses of apomorphine induce locomotor stimulation by activating dopamine postsynaptic receptors. We compared the effects of low (0.05 mg/kg) vs. high (2.0 mg/kg) repeated apomorphine treatments (5) using paired/unpaired protocols upon the development of Pavlovian conditioned drug responses and upon drug sensitization effects. In addition to the conventional challenge test for sensitization, we also conducted a treatment reversal sensitization test in which low dose groups received the high dose treatment and vice versa. The high dose treatment produced the expected Pavlovian conditioned locomotor stimulant response as well as a sensitization effect in the high dose challenge test; but in the low dose challenge test, the effect was desensitization. The low dose apomorphine regimen induced an inhibitory sensitization effect in the low dose challenge test. In the high dose reversal challenge test, there was a sensitization effect to the locomotor stimulant effect. The low dose apomorphine treatments, however, did not produce a Pavlovian conditioned locomotor inhibitory effect. Surprisingly, the dose reversal challenge test revealed context-independent as well as context-specific sensitization/desensitization effects. These findings demonstrate that Pavlovian drug conditioned effects and drug sensitization effects are independent phenomena and that sensitization effects are not response specific. Moreover, context-specific vs. context-independent sensitization effects were protocol dependent but not drug dose dependent."
"Exercise is one of the best-known stimulators of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, but it is not known if voluntary changes in the intensity of exercise are accompanied by changes in neurogenesis. In this study we investigated whether a reward influences the performance in a running wheel and the rate of cell proliferation, neuronal differentiation and cell death in C57BL/6 mice. Mice had free access to a running wheel during the first week of the experiment. In the second week, animals were rewarded for their performance and compared to normal voluntary running and control mice. A reward significantly increased the performance by 78% when compared to the non-rewarded performance of the first week. The performance of the non-rewarded runners remained relatively constant. Fourteen days of exercise significantly increased cell proliferation by 27% and the number of doublecortin immunoreactive cells by 46%. A reward and the associated increase of performance did not modulate proliferation, cell death or the number of cells entering the neuronal lineage. We suggest that, in C57BL/6 mice, either exercise increases adult hippocampal neurogenesis to a ceiling value, which is reached by a performance at or below the level achieved by voluntary wheel running, or that a possible positive effect of increased running-wheel activity is balanced by stress resulting from rewarded running, which is no longer performed on a strictly voluntary basis."
"Confusion or frustration connected with daily demands involving left-right discrimination is a common observation even in neurologically intact adults. We aimed to test the hypothesis that the degree of left-right confusion is associated with bodily asymmetry. Sixty-two female volunteers performed a left-right decision task that required fast responses to visually presented directional words (left, right, up, down) or pictograms (&lt;--, --&gt;, upward arrow, downward arrow). Participants also performed several tests that measured asymmetry of handedness, grip strength, and tactile sensitivity, and completed self-reports on left-right confusion and perceived bodily asymmetry. Results showed significant correlations between left-right confusion and the degree of handedness and asymmetry in tactile sensitivity. These results suggest that individuals who reveal a stronger internal bias between both sides of the body show less left-right confusion than people with less salient bodily asymmetry."
"Object location task (OLT) has been used as a model of hippocampal-dependent memory. Despite this application, there is neither a consistent pharmacological validation of NMDA receptor modulation nor an evaluation of hippocampal participation in mice. In the OLT, mice were placed in the open field with two identical objects for 3 min and, after a delay of 30, 90, 180 or 360 min, one object was moved to a new location and the time spent exploring the objects in new, (novel) and old (familiar) locations was recorded. Our results showed that the mice were able to discriminate object location when tested either 90 or 180 min after training. Intraperitoneal administration of MK801 (NMDA receptors antagonist) or scopolamine (mACh antagonist) induced amnesic effects. On the other hand, D-cycloserine (NMDA agonist) or tacrine (cholinesterase inhibitor) were able to improve memory in the mice tested. In addition, lidocaine infusion in the hippocampal CA1 region 10 min before training blocked object location memory. In short, this work indicates that OLT is susceptible to modulation of NMDA receptors, cholinergic neurotransmission and it is the first to characterize the participation of the hippocampal CA1 region, in this task."
"Four-plate test-retest (FPT-R) is a useful tool to study aversive memory and abolishment of benzodiazepine effects in experienced mice to four-plate test (FPT), namely one-trial tolerance. In the present study, we have used local injections paradigm, in order to localize structures implied in anxiolytic-like effects of two drugs in na&#xef;ve and experienced mice: a benzodiazepine, diazepam that is only active in na&#xef;ve mice; and a 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist, DOI that exert its anxiolytic-like effect both in na&#xef;ve and experienced mice. Periacqueductal grey substance, three sub-regions of hippocampus (CA1, CA2 and CA3) and two nuclei of amygdala (BLA and LA) have been studied. Local injections did not cause any modifications of ambulatory activity. DOI injections elicit anxiolytic-like effects only when injected into CA2, in na&#xef;ve and experienced mice. Diazepam had an anxiolytic-like effect in na&#xef;ve mice, only when injected into lateral nucleus of amygdala; and in experienced mice when injected into PAG. These results help us to better understand the way of action of these two compounds and the structures functionally involved in their effects and in one-trial tolerance (OTT)."
"The opiate-receptor antagonist naloxone was administered to rats after passive-avoidance training either alone or in combination with forced-swim stress. A retention test revealed that while naloxone enhanced retention when administered alone, it impaired retention when administered in combination with forced-swim stress. The findings provide evidence for a ""protective"" endogenous opioid-based system that, when not blocked pharmacologically, limits enhancement or impairment of retention under conditions of mild and intense stress, respectively."
"Neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies have implicated the human posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in sensorimotor integration and saccade planning. However, the temporal dynamics of the underlying physiology and its relationship to observations in non-human primates have been difficult to pin down. Here we review some recent work that investigates the role of human parietal neuronal synchronization in the coding and updating of visuomotor representations in saccade and anti-saccade tasks. We also discuss this work in relation to findings made on different spatial and temporal scales in monkey and human posterior parietal cortex."
"Deficits in social behaviour is a characteristic of numerous mental disorders including autism, schizophrenia, depression and Alzheimer's disease. For the assessment of pharmacological and genetic experimental disease models, conventional social interaction tasks bear the uncertainty that any drug-induced abnormality of the investigator may feed back to the drug-free companion modifying its reactions. A considerable technical improvement was recently reported by Moy et al. [Moy SS, Nadler JJ, Perez A, Barbaro RP, Johns JM, Magnuson T, et al. Sociability and preference for social novelty in five inbred strains: an approach to assess autistic-like behaviours in mice. Genes Brain Behav 2004;3:287-302] in which the drug free partner is confined to a small cage and social contacts of the investigator are recorded uncontaminated of any social reactions of the stranger. Using this novel behavioural paradigm, we here show in C57Bl/6 female mice that sociability (social interaction with a stranger mouse) is not impaired after administration of the anxiolytic diazepam (0.1-1 mg/kg) or the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine hydrobromide (0.1-1 mg/kg). However, social memory tested after a short time interval was impaired by both drugs in a dose-dependent manner (diazepam: &gt; or = 0.5mg/kg; scopolamine: &gt; or = 0.3mg/kg). The scopolamine-induced short-term memory deficit was reversed to normal by the choline esterase inhibitor donepezil (1 mg/kg). Given this dependence of social recognition on the cholinergic system, combined with the clinical observation of reduced social contacts in dementia patients, sociability may offer a novel endpoint biomarker with translational value in experimental models of cognitive dysfunction."
"To our knowledge appetite-associated effects of neuropeptide SF (NPSF) are unreported. Thus chicks were intracerebroventricularly injected with 3.8, 7.5 and 15.0 nmol of NPSF and they reduced both their food and water intake. Blood glucose concentration was not affected. Additionally, NPSF-treated chicks did not exhibit any behaviors that were associated with stress or that may be competitive with ingestion. We conclude that NPSF is associated with anorectic and antidipsogenic effects."
The present study investigated whether pigs are able to acquire a complex spatial holeboard discrimination task (4 of 16 holes baited) and whether mixing stress affects performance in this task. All pigs rapidly reduced the number of re-visits to baited holes (working memory) and to unbaited holes (reference memory). Mixing stress did not affect performance.
"Transplantation experiments have shown that neurologic deficits may be reversed by engrafting fresh tissue or engineered cells within dysfunctional neural circuitry. In experimental and clinical settings, this approach has provided insights into the pathology and treatment of neurologic diseases, primarily movement disorders. The present experiments were designed to investigate whether a similar strategy is feasible as a method to investigate, and perhaps repair, circuitry integral to emotional disorders. We focused on the amygdala, a macrostructure known to be involved in the expression of anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. GABAergic cell-rich suspensions were prepared from E17 rat lateral ganglionic eminence and engrafted bilaterally into the lateral and basolateral amygdaloid nuclei of young adult rats. After 6 weeks, increased numbers of GABAergic neurons were identified in the vicinity of the graft sites, and electron microscopy provided evidence for functional integration of transplanted cells. Rats with these grafts spent more time in the open arms of the elevated-plus maze, consistent with an anxioloytic-like phenotype. These rats were also less sensitive to the unconditioned anxiogenic effects of light on the acoustic startle response, although fear-potentiated startle was not affected, suggesting that the grafts produced an attenuation of unlearned fear but did not affect acquisition of conditioned fear. Our results raise the possibility that distinct components of emotion can be modulated by strategic neural engraftment."
"This report investigates in what way functional connectivity may explain how two memory systems that share almost all their structures, can function as separate systems. The first series of experiments was aimed at demonstrating the reliability of our experimental design by showing that acquisition of the spatial version of a water cross-maze task (stimulus-stimulus associations) was impaired by dorsal hippocampal lesions whereas the cue version (stimulus-reinforcement association) was altered by amygdala lesion. Then, we evaluated how these two tasks induce different patterns of connectivity. The connectivity was evaluated by calculating the correlations between the zif-268 immunoreactivity of 22 structures composing the hippocampus and the amygdala systems. We designed a new statistical procedure to demonstrate double dissociations on the basis of brain regional intercorrelations. Our data show that the correlations between the hippocampus and the other structures of the memory system are higher in the place-learning group compared to the cue-learning group, whereas they are enhanced with the amygdala in the latter group compared to the former. This demonstrates that the activation of a memory system consists in the focusing of functional connectivity toward the central structure of the system. This may explain how several memory systems can share the same structures while remaining independent."
"The dopamine (DA) projections from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are the key component of the brain reward circuitry. The encoded information by DA in reward-related memory within this circuit during opiate reinforcement requires further clarification. The present study was designed to explore the correlations between morphine dose, retention of morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP), morphine-induced changes in levels of DA and its metabolites in the NAc in expression and retention of CPP in Sprague-Dawley male rats. A dose-effect curve for morphine-induced CPP (0.01-10 mg/kg, i.p.) was obtained using 4-day conditioning sessions followed by a CPP test; the retention of morphine CPP was measured with CPP tests after the development of CPP. We found a dose-dependent effect of morphine (from 0.01 to 10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) on both the magnitude and the retention of CPP. During the retention of morphine-induced CPP, a morphine-dose- and time-dependent elevation of DA and its metabolites was observed in the NAc. These changes were absent if the same dose of morphine was injected outside of the conditioning environment (i.e., in the home cage). These results suggest that that the long-lasting elevation of DA and its metabolites in the NAc is attributable mainly to drug-associated context, rather than the residual effect of morphine."
"There is increasing evidence that a dysfunction of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor system plays a key role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Non-competitive NMDA-antagonists induce schizophrenia-like symptoms and cognitive impairment in healthy humans as well as rodents. As receptor dysfunction precedes clinical disorder manifestation, the present study investigated whether transient perinatal NMDA antagonism constitutes a suitable long-term animal model for schizophrenia. Male Wistar rats were treated from postnatal days 6-21 with the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801, and then subjected to behavioural analysis up to an age of 180d. Alterations in cortical NMDA receptor expression and lymphocyte cAMP-response-element-binding-protein (CREB) were assessed. In comparison to controls, MK-801-treated animals showed differences in behaviour up to an age of 180d. Western blot analysis revealed that transient perinatal application of MK-801 caused a persistent increase in cortical NMDA-R1 protein in combination with a persistent disturbance of CREB phosphorylation, a downstream target of NMDA signalling. This animal model demonstrates that early postnatal NMDA receptor blockade leads to schizophrenia-like symptoms with persistent behavioural and neurochemical disturbances throughout life. Therefore, it might provide a basis for further understanding of the disease and evaluation of new therapeutic strategies."
"There is compelling postmortem evidence that GABA cell dysfunction plays a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SZ). Based on a unique distribution of postmortem abnormalities in layer II of the anterior cingulate cortex and sectors CA3/2 of the hippocampus, we postulated that afferent fibers from the basolateral amygdala to these sites may contribute to diminished GABAergic modulation in these disorders. To test this hypothesis, picrotoxin (PICRO), a non-competitive antagonist of the GABA-A receptor, is stereotaxically infused the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) to increase the flow of excitatory activity into stratum oriens (SO) of sectors CA3/2 of the hippocampus. This pharmacological manipulation results in a selective reduction of GABAergic interneurons containing parvalbumin, calbindin and calretinin in CA3/2. Using single cell recordings in a hippocampal slide preparation, these changes in PICRO-treated rats seem to be associated with a reduction in evoked and spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (sIPSCs) recorded from pyramidal neurons in sector CA3/2, but not CA1. A lower resting membrane potential and an increased action potential firing rate have been recorded in interneurons in the SO of CA2/3, but not CA1. Additionally, currents associated with hyperpolarization-activated cationic channels (Ih), which help to control neuronal firing rates of GABA cells in the hippocampus, were also increased. Overall, these studies support the view that postmortem studies contribute information for the development of empiric models of SZ, ones that can be used as translational tools for elucidating the functional changes that may be present in GABA cell subtypes their molecular regulatory mechanisms in this disorder."
"In this study, we investigated whether glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) had antidepressant-like effects in mice, and whether these activities were associated with monoamine systems in mice. Antidepressant-like effects were evaluated based on the immobility time in the forced-swim test. GLP-2 (1.5-6 microg/mouse, i.c.v.) significantly reduced the immobility time in a dose-dependent manner without affecting locomotor activity in the wheel running test and memory function in the step-down passive avoidance test. These effects were inhibited by pretreatment with metergoline (an antagonist of non-specific 5-HT receptors), parachlorophenylalanine (an inhibitor of 5-HT synthase), NAN-190 (an antagonist of 5-HT1A receptors), yohimbine hydrochloride (an antagonist of alpha2 adrenoceptors), atenolol (an antagonist of beta1 receptors), and raclopride (an antagonist of D2 receptors), but not prazosin (an antagonist of alpha1 adrenoceptors), ICI118551 (an antagonist of beta2 adrenoceptors), and SCH23394 (an antagonist of D1 receptors). These results suggest that GLP-2 exerts antidepressant-like effects in the forced-swim test in mice, which are associated with 5-HT1A, alpha2, beta1 and D2 receptors."
"NRCAM (Neuronal Cell Adhesion Molecule) has an important role in axonal guidance and the organization of neural circuitry during brain development. Association analyses in human populations have identified NRCAM as a candidate gene for autism susceptibility. In the present study, we evaluated Nrcam-null mice for sociability, social novelty preference, and reversal learning as a model for the social deficits, repetitive behavior, and cognitive rigidity characteristic of autism. Prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle responses was also measured, to reflect sensorimotor-gating deficits in autism spectrum disorders. Assays for anxiety-like behavior in an elevated plus maze and open field, motor coordination, and olfactory ability in a buried food test were conducted to provide control measures for the interpretation of results. Overall, the loss of Nrcam led to behavioral alterations in sociability, acquisition of a spatial task, and reversal learning, dependent on sex. In comparison to male wild type mice, male Nrcam-null mutants had significantly decreased sociability in a three-chambered choice task. Low sociability in the male null mutants was not associated with changes in anxiety-like behavior, activity, or motor coordination. Male, but not female, Nrcam-null mice had small decreases in prepulse inhibition. Nrcam deficiency in female mice led to impaired acquisition of spatial learning in the Morris water maze task. Reversal learning deficits were observed in both male and female Nrcam-null mice. These results provide evidence that NRCAM mediates domains of function relevant to symptoms observed in autism."
"The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is emerging as a promising model organism for experimental studies of stress and anxiety. Here we further validate zebrafish models of stress by analyzing how environmental and pharmacological manipulations affect their behavioral and physiological phenotypes. Experimental manipulations included exposure to alarm pheromone, chronic exposure to fluoxetine, acute exposure to caffeine, as well as acute and chronic exposure to ethanol. Acute (but not chronic) alarm pheromone and acute caffeine produced robust anxiogenic effects, including reduced exploration, increased erratic movements and freezing behavior in zebrafish tested in the novel tank diving test. In contrast, ethanol and fluoxetine had robust anxiolytic effects, including increased exploration and reduced erratic movements. The behavior of several zebrafish strains was also quantified to ascertain differences in their behavioral profiles, revealing high-anxiety (leopard, albino) and low-anxiety (wild type) strains. We also used LocoScan (CleverSys Inc.) video-tracking tool to quantify anxiety-related behaviors in zebrafish, and dissect anxiety-related phenotypes from locomotor activity. Finally, we developed a simple and effective method of measuring zebrafish physiological stress responses (based on a human salivary cortisol assay), and showed that alterations in whole-body cortisol levels in zebrafish parallel behavioral indices of anxiety. Collectively, our results confirm zebrafish as a valid, reliable, and high-throughput model of stress and affective disorders."
"The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that sensitivity of ingestive behavior of infant rat to the pharmacological effects of ethanol changes between postnatal (P) days 9 and 12. The intake of 0.1% saccharin and water, general motor activity, and myoclonic twitching activity were assessed following administration of three doses of ethanol (0, 0.25, and 0.5 g/kg) while fluids were free available to the animals. The 0.5 g/kg dose of ethanol attenuated saccharin intake in P9 pups and enhanced saccharin intake in P12 rats. On P12 some sex-related differences emerged at 0.5 g/kg of ethanol, with saccharin intake being higher in females than in their male counterparts. Taste reactivity probe revealed that 0.5 g/kg of ethanol increased taste responsiveness to saccharin on P12 but only to infusions presented at a high rate. The results of the present study indicate that ontogenetic changes in sensitivity to the effects of ethanol on ingestive behavior occur during the second postnatal week, with P9 animals being more sensitive to the inhibitory (sedative) effects on saccharin intake and P12 rats being more sensitive to the stimulatory effects of ethanol. We suggest that acute ethanol enhanced saccharin intake via sensitization of oral response to appetitive taste stimulation."
"Electro-acupuncture (EA) is believed to be effective for alleviating motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. In a rat hemiparkinsonian model induced by unilateral transection of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB), the effects of EA stimulation were investigated. EA stimulation at a high frequency (100 Hz) significantly reduced apomorphine-induced rotational behavior. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemical staining revealed that EA at 100 Hz protected axotomized dopaminergic neurons from degeneration in the substantia nigra (SN). Moreover, high frequency EA reversed the axotomy-induced decrease in substance P content and increase in glutamate decarboxylase-67 (GAD 67) mRNA level in the midbrain; however, it did not affect the axotomy-induced increase in enkephalin content in the globus pallidus. These results suggest that the effects of high frequency EA on motor symptoms of Parkinsonian rats may involve restoration of the homeostasis of dopaminergic transmission in the basal ganglia circuit."
"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether sexual incentive motivation and copulatory performance are regulated by different subregions of the medial preoptic area (MPOA). Sexual incentive motivation was measured by means of a partner preference test. Both copulatory behavior and sexual incentive motivation were tested in male rats treated with 50mg/kg of either EGb 761 or a vehicle (distilled water) by gavage for 14 days. Administration of EGb 761 increased the number of intromissions, but had no effect on the number of mounts, mount latency, intromission latency, ejaculation latency, or post-ejaculatory interval. In the partner preference test, the total duration of visits to estrous female rats in both of the groups was significantly different from the total duration of visits to sexually active males. EGb 761 treatment increased the number of ejaculations compared both to vehicle-treated controls on day 14 and the same group on day 0. In comparison with the controls, the EGb 761-treated group showed a significant increase in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing cells in the dorsal, but not the ventral, subregion of the MPOA, and significantly high dopamine levels in the MPOA. These results indicate that EGb 761 does not affect sexual incentive motivation, but facilitates copulatory performance in male rats, suggesting that the mechanisms responsible for sexual incentive motivation and copulatory performance may be associated with differential functions of MPOA subregions."
"Maternal behavior in rats undergoes considerable plasticity in parallel to the developmental stage of the pups, resulting in distinct patterns of maternal behavior and care at different postpartum time points. The medial preoptic area (mPOA) of the hypothalamus is one critical neural substrate underlying the onset and early expression of maternal behavior in rats but little is known about its specific functional role in the evolving expression of maternal behavior across the postpartum period. The present study uses a reversible local neural inactivation method to examine the role of the mPOA in the regulation of maternal behavior throughout the postpartum period, particularly extending into the late postpartum, a little examined period. This approach avoids the compensatory plasticity in CNS that occurs after permanent lesions, and allows the repeated testing of same individuals. Early (PPD7-8) and late (PPD13-14) postpartum maternal behavior was evaluated in female rats following infusions of bupivacaine or vehicle into the mPOA or into control areas. As expected, mPOA inactivation severely but transiently disrupted early postpartum maternal behavior whereas infusion of vehicle or inactivation of adjacent control sites did not. Later in the postpartum period, however, transient mPOA inactivation facilitated the expression of maternal behaviors, highly contrasting the behavioral expression levels characteristic of late postpartum. Results strongly demonstrate that the mPOA is differentially engaged throughout postpartum in orchestrating appropriate maternal responses with the developmental stage of the pups."
"Substance P (SP) can have positive reinforcing or aversive properties, depending on the dose used and the site of action in the brain. Experimental findings suggest that the amygdala is involved in reward-related processes. The presence of SP-immunoreactive fibers and cell bodies has been shown in the central nucleus (ACE) and neurokinin (NK)-1 and NK-3 receptors also could be found there. The rewarding or aversive effects of SP in the ACE were tested in conditioned place preference paradigm. 10 ng SP microinjections had positive reinforcing properties, while 100 ng SP had no effect. Prior treatment with NK-1 receptor antagonist could block the rewarding effects of SP, while the antagonist on its own did not influence place preference. Our results show that SP and NK-1 receptors play important roles in amygdaloid rewarding-reinforcing mechanisms."
"The vagus nerve participates in the control and regulation of important autonomous functions, emotional tasks, and neural activity. Electrical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an approved procedure for the treatment of refractory epilepsy in humans. VNS has also been shown to improve mood complaints and cognitive function in both human patients and animals. Thus, the purpose of this study was to analyse and describe the effects of VNS on the development and establishment of sensory habituation and electrographic activity of the visual pathway in freely moving cats. Six cats had implants placed in the optic chiasm (OC), lateral geniculate body (LGB), mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF), primary visual cortex (VC) of the left hemisphere, and left vagus nerve. Immediately after surgery, all cats presented anisocoria and relaxation of the left nictitant membrane. Also showed vegetative-type responses such as myosis, licking, and swallowing during VNS. Animals were then subjected to repeated luminous stimuli at intervals of 1 and 3s to cause habituation. The effect of VNS on the frequency and latency of the habituation episodes and the electrographic changes in the registered brain structures were analysed. Latency analysis showed that VNS delayed the first habituation episode. VNS had transitory effects on the neural activity of the primary visual pathway structures, which caused a small but measurable delay in the establishment of habituation. In conclusion, VNS interferes with the development and establishment of visual habituation, an elementary form of non-associative learning, in freely moving cats."
"Previous studies have associated stress with poor outcome in individuals affected by stroke. It was suggested that the effects of stress depend on the stressor's type and strength. Here we compare the effects of chronic predictable restraint stress and chronic unpredictable variable stress on motor recovery after focal lesion in the rat motor cortex. Adult male rats were pre-trained and tested in skilled reaching and skilled walking tasks. Animals were assigned to daily treatments of either restraint stress or variable stress starting 1 week prior to lesion up to 2 weeks post-lesion. One group served as lesion only control. The results revealed a distinct pattern of recovery and compensation of skilled movement. Animals exposed to predictable restraint stress had significantly lower reaching success at both pre- and post-lesion time points, and higher error rates in skilled walking when compared to lesion controls. Overall, restraint stress induced more pronounced motor impairments prior to and after injury than variable stress. Variable stress increased the number of attempts required to grasp food pellets and changed movement pattern performance. By contrast, variable stress improved limb placement accuracy when compared to lesion controls. The behavioural changes were not accompanied by differences in infarct size. These findings are in agreement with other studies reporting that both chronic predicable restraint stress and unpredictable variable stress influence the course of recovery following stroke, however, restraint stress might affect stroke recovery through a different route than variable stress."
"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HD gene. Besides psychiatric, motor and cognitive symptoms, HD patients suffer from sleep disturbances. In order to screen a rat model transgenic for HD (tgHD rats) for sleep-wake cycle dysregulation, we monitored their circadian activity peaks in the present study. TgHD rats of both sexes showed hyperactivity during the dark cycle and more frequent light cycle activity peaks indicative for a disturbed sleep-wake cycle. Focusing on males at the age of 4 and 14 months, analyses of receptor levels in the hypothalamus and the basal forebrain revealed that 5-HT(2A)- and adrenergic alpha(2)-receptor densities in these regions were significantly altered in tgHD rats compared to their wild-type littermates. Adrenergic receptor densities correlated negatively with the light cycle hyperactivity peaks at later stages of the disease in male tgHD rats. Furthermore, reduced leptin levels, a feature associated with circadian misalignment, were present. Our study demonstrates that the male tgHD rat is a suitable model to investigate HD associated sleep alterations. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the role of adrenergic- and 5-HT(2A)-receptors as therapeutic targets for dysregulation of the circadian activity in HD."
"It has been found that acute social stress in male OF1 mice produced a general immunosuppression and increased B16F10 tumor development. This study examined the effects of blocking either the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis or the sympathetic adrenomedullary (SAM) system on the impact of such stress on tumor development. Naive male OF1 mice were individually housed for 12 days before being inoculated with tumor cells or vehicle. Six days later, tumor-bearing mice were inoculated with antalarmin (a corticotropin-releasing factor receptor antagonist), nadolol (a beta-adrenergic antagonist) or vehicle. All these mice were subjected to social stress by pairing them for 24h with counterparts selected for their high and homogeneous levels of aggressiveness. The pairs were only in physical contact for three 5-min periods, being in sensory contact for the rest of this period. One hour after social stress, serum corticosterone and IFN-gamma levels were analyzed in each experimental group. Fifteen days later, lungs were removed to determine the number of metastatic foci with their areas, and blood samples were taken to assess serum titers of corticosterone and IFN-gamma. Both antalarmin and nadolol-treated mice developed significantly fewer metastatic foci with smaller areas than vehicle-treated subjects although only the group treated with antalarmin had reduced corticosterone levels. This study confirms that social stress has complex effects on immune system and tumor development that are not simply linked to corticosterone titers."
"There have been several studies showing the relationship between sex hormones and personality traits. Cytochrome P450 19 (CYP 19, aromatase) is the rate-limiting enzyme for the conversion of androgens into estrogens, and it has been reported that the C/T single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of CYP19 gene (rs10046) affects dispositions of estradiol and testosterone. Therefore, it is hypothesized that this polymorphism affects personality traits. In the present study, the association of this polymorphism with personality traits was examined in 633 healthy Japanese subjects. Personality traits were assessed by the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), and the CYP19 genotype was detected by a PCR-RFLP method. In males, the group with the T allele predictive of elevated levels of estradiol and decreased levels of testosterone had lower scores of harm avoidance than that without the T allele (p=0.015). In females, none of the seven TCI dimensions was different between the two genotype groups. The present study thus suggests that the C/T polymorphism in the 3'UTR of CYP19 gene affects personality trait of harm avoidance in healthy males."
"Type 2 diabetes has been identified as a risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD). Insulin signalling is often impaired in AD, contributing to the neurodegeneration seen in AD. Previous studies have shown that the incretin glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) helps to normalise insulin signalling in type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 also plays important roles in neuronal activity and brain functions. We tested the specific role of GLP-1 receptors in synaptic plasticity and cognitive processes in a GLP-1 receptor knockout (Glp1r(-/-)) mouse model. In an open field assessment, no general difference in exploratory and anxiety was found except for a small decrease in running speed was found (p&lt;0.05). In an object recognition task, Glp1r(-/-) mice explored objects in a similar way to WT controls but did not learn to differentiate between novel and familiar objects (p&lt;0.05) while in an object relocation task, no impairment was observed. In a water maze task, Glp1r(-/-) mice were impaired in the acquisition phase (p&lt;0.001), and also in the probe recall task (p&lt;0.05). LTP in area CA1 of the hippocampus was severely impaired in Glp1r(-/-) mice (p&lt;0.0001). Paired-pulse facilitation was also impaired at 25ms interstimulus interval (p&lt;0.05) but not at longer intervals. The results demonstrate that the murine GLP-1R plays an important role in the control of synaptic plasticity and in some forms of memory formation. The results shed light on the molecular processes that underlie the neuroprotective properties of GLP-1 analogues in animal models of Alzheimer's disease."
"Much research has indicated that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signal transduction pathway is involved in the pathophysiological mechanism of depression. But as to the question of which MAPKs are more relevant to stress effects, there is no definite answer. In the present study, 32 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) and control groups, with 16 rats in each group. The CUS rats were exposed to 21-day chronic unpredictable stressors, and the controls were stress-free. After stress, 16 rats (8 in each group) were tested for spatial memory using Morris Water Maze, and 16 rats (8 from each group) were decapitated for detection of the three most extensively studied subgroups of MAPKs, ERK1/2, JNK and P38, and CREB in the hippocampus. The results showed that there was no statistical difference in the body weight between the two groups. The CUS rats showed impaired spatial memory in MWM. Western blot of hippocampus showed that CUS significantly decreased pCREB and pJNK levels, but there was no statistical difference between two groups in CREB, ERK1/2, pERK1/2, P38, pP38 and JNK levels. Immunohistochemistry showed that the reduced pCREB occurred in the dentate gyrus, not in the hippocampus proper. In conclusion, this study highlights that the JNK-CREB pathway, not the P38-CREB or ERK1/2-CREB pathway, in the hippocampus played an important role in the 21-day-CUS, and that the impaired spatial memory acquisition in the CUS rats can be restored to the level comparable to the pre-stressed state."
"Zebrafish, one of the preferred study species of geneticists, is gaining increasing popularity in behavioral neuroscience. This small and prolific species may be an excellent tool with which the biological mechanisms of vertebrate brain function and behavior are investigated. Zebrafish has been proposed as a model organism in the analysis of fear responses and human anxiety disorders. Species-specific cues signaling the presence of predators have been successfully utilized in such research. Zebrafish has been shown to respond to its natural alarm substance with species-typical fear reactions. However, the extraction of this alarm substance and ascertaining its consistent dosing has been problematic. A synthetic substance with a known chemical identity and molecular weight would allow precise dosing and experimental control. Previously, the chemical component, hypoxanthine 3-N-oxide, common to several fish alarm substances has been identified and has been shown to elicit alarm reactions in fish species belonging to the Osteriophysan superorder. In the current study we investigate the effect of hypoxanthine 3-N-oxide by exposing zebrafish to three different concentrations of this synthetic substance. Our results show that the substance efficaciously induces species-typical fear reactions increasing the number of erratic movement episodes and jumps in zebrafish. We discuss the translational relevance of our findings and conclude that hypoxanthine 3-N-oxide will have utility to elicit fear responses in the laboratory in a precisely controlled manner in zebrafish."
"In despite the similarity of mechanisms of action between both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and MDMA (main compound of ""Ecstasy"") there are relatively few reports on the effects of the later on animal models of depression. There are many animal models designed to create or to assess depression. Mild chronic stress (MCS) is a procedure designed to create depression. MCS includes the chronic exposure of the animal to several stressors. After that, rats show behavioural changes associated to depression. In the other hand, the active avoidance task (AAT) is an experimental situation in which an animal has to accomplish a particular behaviour in order to avoid the application of a stressor. Animals exhibiting depression fail to acquire avoidance responses as rapidly as normal animals do. In order to assess the effect of MDMA on the acquisition of an active avoidance response, forty-five rats were divided in two groups exposed or not exposed to MCS. Rats also received chronic intracerebroventricular MDMA (0.2microg/microl; 1microl), fluoxetine (2.0microg/microl; 1microl) or saline solution (0.9%; 1microl). Our results showed that the effect of MDMA depends upon the level of stress. MDMA treated animals showed better acquisition (F([2,37])=7.046; P=0.003) and retention (F([2,37])=3.900; P=0.029) of the avoidance response than fluoxetine or saline treated animals when exposed to MCS. This finding suggests that MDMA (and no fluoxetine) was able to change the aversive valence of the stressors maybe enhancing coping strategies. This effect could serve as a protective factor against helplessness and maybe post-traumatic stress."
"Individuals are increasingly exposed to light at night. Exposure to constant light (LL) disrupts circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, body temperature, hormones, and the sleep-wake cycle in animals. Other behavioural responses to LL have been reported, but are inconsistent. The present experiment sought to determine whether LL produces changes in affective responses and whether behavioural changes are mediated by alterations in glucocorticoid concentrations. Relative to conspecifics maintained in a light/dark cycle (LD, 16:8 light/dark), male Swiss-Webster mice exposed to LL for three weeks increased depressive-like behavioural responses as evaluated by the forced swim test and sucrose anhedonia. Furthermore, providing a light escape tube reversed the effects of LL in the forced swim test. LL mice displayed reduced anxiety as evaluated by the open field and elevated-plus maze. Glucocorticoid concentrations were reduced in the LL group suggesting that the affective behavioural responses to LL are not the result of elevated corticosterone. Additionally, mice housed in LD with a clear tube displayed increased paired testes mass as compared to LL mice. Taken together, these data provide evidence that exposure to unnatural lighting can induce significant changes in affect, increasing depressive-like and decreasing anxiety-like responses."
"Administration of several drugs of abuse on a 24-h schedule has been shown to entrain both pre-drug (anticipatory) and post-drug (evoked) circadian activity episodes that persist for several days when the drug is withheld. The present study tested the entrainment effects of fentanyl, an opioid agonist with a noted abuse liability, and haloperidol, an anti-psychotic dopamine antagonist without apparent abuse liability. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats housed under constant light in cages with attached running wheels received repeated low, medium, or high doses of either fentanyl or haloperidol on a 24-h administration schedule followed by a 31-h schedule (Experiment 1) or solely on a 31-h schedule (Experiment 2). The results showed that all three doses of fentanyl entrained both pre-drug and post-drug episodes of wheel running when administered every 24h, and the combined pre- and post-fentanyl activity episodes persisted for at least 3 days when the drug was withheld during test days. On the 31-h schedule, fentanyl produced an ""ensuing"" activity episode approximately 24h post-administration, but failed to produce an anticipatory episode 29-31h post-administration. In contrast, haloperidol injections failed to produce both pre-drug episodes on the 24-h schedule and circadian ensuing episodes on the 31-h schedule, and post-haloperidol suppression of activity appeared to mask the free-running activity rhythm. Taken together, these results provide additional evidence that drugs of abuse share a common ability to entrain circadian activity episodes."
"Weight regain after weight loss is a major hurdle for combating obesity. The aim of this study is to examine orexigenic and anorectic neuropeptides of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Arc) in response to weight loss after chronic energy intake restriction. Thirty mice were fed with a high-fat diet for 8 weeks and then classified as diet-induced obese (DIO; n=10) or diet-resistant (DR; n=10) mice according to the highest and lowest body weight gainers. Five mice from DIO and DR groups were placed on an energy restricted diet or continued on their high-fat diet ad libitum for 6 weeks. An additional five mice were on a LF diet throughout the course of this study as controls. Results showed that a six-week energy restricted diet completely reversed the increased body weight, fat mass and leptin in the DIO mice to the levels of the LF and DR mice. Arc neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP) mRNA expression in DIO mice after obesity reversal were significantly higher than DIO mice without obesity reversal (17%, 47%, both p&lt;0.05), while the Arc pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) mRNA showed no difference. Both NPY and AgRP expression in DIO mice were negatively correlated with plasma leptin (R=-0.78, p&lt;0.05; R=-0.72, p&lt;0.05). In conclusion, while chronic energy restriction will lead to weight loss, it can up-regulate hypothalamic orexigenic peptides, which may be an important contributing factor to weight regain after a weight loss program from an energy restricted diet."
"The antidepressant-like effect of tipepidine was studied in rats. Tipepidine at 20 and 40 mg/kg i.p. reduced immobility in the forced swimming test and tipepidine at 40 mg/kg, i.p. increased climbing in the test. The drug at 40 mg/kg, i.p. had no effect on the locomotor activity and motor coordination. These results suggest that tipepidine may be a novel drug with antidepressant-like activity."
"Whereas acute stress often results in analgesia, chronic stress can trigger hyperalgesia/allodynia. This influence of long-term stress on nociception is relevant to numerous painful pathologies, such as fibromyalgia (FM), characterized by diffuse muscular pain (hyperalgesia) and/or tenderness (allodynia). Hence, there is a need for pre-clinical models integrating a chronic-stress dimension to the study of pain. Here, we assessed the effects of protracted/intermittent stress produced by daily, 1h restraint periods in cylinders, 4 days/week over 5 weeks, on eight models of hyperalgesia and allodynia in rats. This type of stress potentiated chemical hyperalgesia in the formalin model (160 and 76% increase of pain score above controls, during the early and late phases, respectively). It also produced thermal allodynia in response to cold (paw acetone test: 200% increase of allodynia score during week 3-5) and heat (42 degrees C tail immersion test: 15% decrease of withdrawal threshold, from week 2 onward). This stress also resulted in mechanical allodynia in the von Frey filaments model (60% decrease in threshold during week 2-5). However, such a stress regimen had no influence in the Randall-Selitto test of mechanical hyperalgesia, and in the tail immersion models of cold (4 degrees C) or hot (48 degrees C) thermal hyperalgesia, as well as cold (15 degrees C) allodynia. This model of prolonged/intermittent restraint stress may be useful in investigating the mechanisms linking stress and pain, and provide an assay to assess the potential therapeutic efficacy of drugs targeted against painful pathologies with a strong stress component, including but not restricted to FM."
"We have previously observed that amitriptyline and other antidepressants produce impairing effects on inhibitory avoidance (also called passive avoidance) in mice of both sexes. In the present study we investigated the involvement of the cholinergic system in the inhibitory avoidance impairment produced by acute amitriptyline in male and female CD1 mice. For this purpose, the effects on said task of acute i.p. administration of several doses of amitriptyline, either alone or in combination with the cholinergic agonists oxotremorine and physostigmine, were evaluated. Pre-training administration of 5, 7.5, 10 or 15 mg/kg of amitriptyline produced a significant impairment of inhibitory avoidance in both males and females. When oxotremorine (0.05 or 0.1 mg/kg) was co-administered with amitriptyline, the antidepressant's impairing effect was partially counteracted, although inhibitory avoidance learning was not significant. Physostigmine (0.15, 0.3 or 0.6 mg/kg) counteracted the impairment produced by amitriptyline, as mice treated with both drugs exhibited inhibitory avoidance learning. These results show that the inhibitory avoidance impairment produced by amitriptyline in male and female mice is mediated, at least partially, by the cholinergic system."
"Territorial male mice can form familiarity-dependent amicable relationships, suggesting that they manage their territorial aggressiveness based on individual recognition, which may be mediated by olfactory signals. The present study demonstrated modulatory effect of odorant cues from mice of different social/housing groups on territorial scent marking by C57BL/6J males. Pair-housed males deposited few scent marks in a novel situation without mouse odors, while singly-housed males marked more in the same situation (Experiment 1). However, when confronted by a conspecific, singly-housed males made fewer marks to pair-housed than to singly-housed stimulus males, while pair-housed males showed few marks to either stimulus animal (Experiment 2). Reduction in scent marking in singly-housed males was also seen on exposure to urine scent alone from a pair-housed male, indicating that the inhibitory cue is mediated by urinary odor (Experiment 3). This inhibitory odor was effective even when singly-housed males were placed in a no-odor environment following exposure to soiled bedding used by pair-housed males (Experiment 4). When singly-housed males were exposed to scent from subordinate males, they showed less marking than when the stimulus scent was from dominants or singly-housed males (Experiment 5). Scent marking was not influenced by the total amount of urine scent marks deposited on the substrates (Experiment 6), suggesting that it is a particular component in urinary odor rather than the magnitude of the odor, that plays a significant role in recipient behavior. Together, these experiments indicate that conspecific male odor signals modulate territorial scent marking behavior in mice."
The rat maternal separation paradigm can be used to examine the biological consequences of early-life stress. Immunomodulatory polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have recently attracted attention in the study of stress-related disorders. We established the plasma PUFA profile of maternally separated rodents compared to controls. Our results identify a proinflammatory PUFA profile as a persistent consequence of early-life stress and suggest new avenues of investigation in stress-related disorders.
"Recent observations have suggested that Ras signaling includes combinations of extracellular-signal-regulated Ras activation at the plasma membrane and endomembranes, and translocation of Ras from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments. In this study we have shown that social isolation of rat decreases the content of Bcl-2-associated K-Ras in hippocampal mitochondria, whereas the amount of H-Ras is increased in the microsomal fraction. Furthermore, we have found that galectin 1, a binding partner of activated Ras, was increased in the soluble fractions. The redistribution of Ras isoforms was accompanied by acceleration in mitochondrial hexokinase and inhibition of mitochondrial aconitase, succinate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase, whereas the activity of aldolase, as well as cytoplasmic creatine kinase was not changed. Our data suggest that inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and compensatory elevation of glycolysis in hippocampus occurs during social isolation of rats and Ras trafficking could play an important role in switching of impaired oxidative phosphorylation to anaerobic glycolysis."
"Homocysteine (HCY) is a known risk factor for neuronal diseases. We here report that HCY (10-1000 microM) interfered bi-directionally with long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices, causing an impairment at concentrations &lt;100 microM, and enhancement &gt; or =500 microM. By comparison, NMDA unidirectionally reduced LTP, whereas l-cysteine led to facilitated LTP. Such HCY-induced alterations in neuronal communication may contribute to cognitive failure in dementia."
"An altered response to reinforcement has been proposed as a mechanism underlying many of the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We measured sensitivity to delay of reinforcement in two animal models of ADHD, the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and a newly proposed model, the genetically hypertensive (GH) rat. A task previously used to measure effects of delay of reinforcement in children with ADHD was adapted for use in the present experiment. The SHR and GH rats were compared to their respective genetic control strains, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY), and Wistar (WI). The experimental task required pressing one of two available levers each trial. One lever delivered an immediate reinforcement, and the other lever a delayed reinforcement. Both the SHR and GH strains allocated significantly more responses to the immediately reinforced lever than their genetic control strains. Individual instances of reinforcement differentially affected response allocation in the GH but not the SHR. These findings support the use of the SHR and GH rat to model altered response to reinforcement, and demonstrate the additional value of the GH strain to model the effects of individual instances of reinforcement in children with ADHD."
"Aluminium is a potent neurotoxin and has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) causality for decades. Prolonged aluminium exposure induces oxidative stress and increases amyloid beta levels in vivo. Current treatment modalities for AD provide only symptomatic relief thus necessitating the development of new drugs with fewer side effects. The aim of the study was to demonstrate the protective effect of chronic curcumin administration against aluminium-induced cognitive dysfunction and oxidative damage in rats. Aluminium chloride (100 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered to rats daily for 6 weeks. Rats were concomitantly treated with curcumin (per se; 30 and 60 mg/kg, p.o.) daily for a period of 6 weeks. On the 21st and 42nd day of the study behavioral studies to evaluate memory (Morris water maze and elevated plus maze task paradigms) and locomotion (photoactometer) were done. The rats were sacrificed on 43rd day following the last behavioral test and various biochemical tests were performed to assess the extent of oxidative damage. Chronic aluminium chloride administration resulted in poor retention of memory in Morris water maze, elevated plus maze task paradigms and caused marked oxidative damage. It also caused a significant increase in the acetylcholinesterase activity and aluminium concentration in aluminium treated rats. Chronic administration of curcumin significantly improved memory retention in both tasks, attenuated oxidative damage, acetylcholinesterase activity and aluminium concentration in aluminium treated rats (P&lt;0.05). Curcumin has neuroprotective effects against aluminium-induced cognitive dysfunction and oxidative damage."
"Early exposure to infection is known to affect brain development and has been linked to an increased risk for schizophrenia. The present study aimed to determine whether neonatal infection produced long-term disruptions in behaviour and pathology that might provide a parallel with that observed in schizophrenia. Rats were administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 500 microg/kg i.p.) on postnatal day 7 and 9. Locomotor activity and object recognition memory were tested at day 35 and day 70. LPS animals were observed to be less active at adulthood as measured by locomotor activity. With regards to object recognition memory, LPS administration produced no early impairment in task performance, however, at day 70 LPS animals spent significantly less time exploring the novel object than control animals. Analysis of brains showed a reduction in expression of parvalbumin immunoreactive neurons in the hippocampus of LPS animals with significant reductions selectively localised to the CA1-CA3 region, and not the dentate gyrus. No changes were observed in prefrontal cortex. These results show that neonatal LPS results in pathophysiological brain changes in hippocampal CA1-CA3 subregions."
"Successful motor behavior depends on optimal information processing and planning. In the present study, the neural response of the motor system to conflict of visuomotor discrepancy (mirror-reversed vision) and complexity (task difficulty and hand laterality) was evaluated during the performance of bimanual actions. EEG coherence, expressing interregional communication, showed that conflict of visuomotor incongruence resulted in activation changes in both hemispheres, whereas conflict of complexity evoked adjustments primarily in the left hemisphere. Furthermore, interhemispheric coherence was modified due to both forms of conflict. This demonstrates that conflict demands elicit distinct processes across the motor system. The data further illustrate that functional couplings are dynamically modulated during bimanual behaviour, suggesting that interactions between brain regions provide higher-order links for information processing and integration in view of complex motor skills."
"Periadolescence is a critical period during which environmental stimuli modulate developmental neural plasticity. This includes the density of mesolimbic dopamine (DA) projections and the mitotic dynamic in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, both involved in central structures for emotional and cognitive functioning. Behavioural tests suggest that even short periods of stimulation can have lasting developmental effects on cognitive and emotional measures. We therefore exposed animals kept in isolation to brief daily context changes during periadolescence (postnatal days 30-60). We assessed the effects on neural development after animals had reached adulthood at postnatal day 90 by measuring the density of dopamine fibres in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (core and shell), olfactory tubercle, and amygdala (basolateral and central), and by labelling mitoses in the dentate gyrus by BrdU. In experimental animals as compared to deprived controls, dopamine fibre densities were increased in the PFC and basolateral amygdala, decreased in the central amygdala, but not altered in the ventral striatum. Hippocampal cell proliferation was decreased. These results show that even a low level of experimental sensory stimulation during periadolescence triggers neural developmental processes, with lasting effects into adulthood."
"This study examined the acute changes in feeding and drinking behaviours of free-feeding and free-drinking pigeons, in response to local injections of metergoline (MET, 5-HT(1/2) receptor antagonist; 7 and 20 nmol), GR46611 (GR, 5-HT(1B/1D) agonist; 2 and 6 nmol) or vehicle, into two components of the arcopallium: the nucleus taeniae of the amygdala (TnA) and the arcopallium intermedium (AI). In the TnA, the highest MET dose elicited a short-lived hyperphagy, without affecting drinking or non-ingestive behaviours during the first hour after injection. In contrast, all MET doses promptly increased drinking when injected in the AI, without affecting feeding; this effect was still evident 3 and 24 h after the treatment. When injected in the TnA, the highest GR dose promptly increased both food and water intake; these effects persisted 24 h after the treatments. GR injections in the AI evoked long-lasting increases in drinking, but not in feeding. Injections of these drugs into other arcopallial nuclei evoked no significant ingestive effects. These data indicate the presence of a tonic inhibitory influence of serotonergic inputs, partially mediated by 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors, on feeding- and drinking-related TnA circuits and on mechanisms controlling drinking in the AI. Compared to data from the rodent medial amygdala, our results suggest that a tonic inhibitory 5-HTergic control of feeding (but not drinking) behaviour, mediated by 5-HT(1/2) receptors and exerted in the medial amygdaloid area, may represent a broadly conserved functional attribute in the amniote brain, but probably involves many important taxa-specific neural mechanisms."
"One hallmark of neurological dysfunction is a reduction in paradoxical sleep (PS) time. To determine if adult rats treated neonatally with low dose domoic acid have altered sleep patterns, a home cage analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms was performed using radio telemetry. Domoate treated rats spent significantly less time in PS than controls during daytime hours even though they spent the same total amount of time sleeping, and showed no difference in stage shifts into the PS stage."
"Performing two tasks simultaneously often degrades performance of one or both tasks. While this dual-task interference is classically interpreted in terms of shared attentional resources, where two motor tasks are performed simultaneously interactions within primary motor cortex (i.e., activity-dependent coupling) may also be a contributing factor. In the present study TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) was used to examine the contribution of activity-dependent coupling to dual-task interference during concurrent performance of a bimanual coordination task and a discrete probe reaction time (RT) task involving the foot. Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that activity-dependent coupling within the leg corticomotor pathway was greater during dual-task performance than single-task performance, and this was associated with interference on the probe RT task (i.e., increased RT). Experiment 3 revealed that dual-task interference occurred regardless of whether the dual-task involved two motor tasks or a motor and cognitive task, however activity-dependent coupling was present only when a dual motor task was performed. This suggests that activity-dependent coupling is less detrimental to performance than attentional processes operating upstream of the corticomotor system. Finally, while prioritising the RT task reduced, but did not eliminate, dual-task interference the contribution of activity-dependent coupling to dual-task interference was not affected by task prioritisation. This suggests that although activity-dependent coupling may contribute to dual motor-task interference, attentional processes appear to be more important. It also suggests that activity-dependent coupling may not be subject to modulation by attentional processes."
"Three decades after the coining of the term chronic fatigue syndrome, the diagnosis of this illness is still symptom based and the aetiology remains elusive. Chronic fatigue syndrome pathogenesis seems to be multifactorial and the possible involvement of immune system is supported. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of the epigallocatechin gallate in a mouse model of immunologically induced chronic fatigue. On 19th day, after lipopolysaccharide/Brucella abortus administration, the mice showed significant increase in immobility period, post swim fatigue and thermal hyperalgesia. Behavioral deficits were coupled with enhanced oxidative-nitrosative stress as evident by increased lipid peroxidation, nitrite levels and decreased endogenous antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione and catalase) and inflammation (increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and tissue growth factor-beta). Chronic treatment with epigallocatechin gallate restored these behavioral and biochemical alterations in mice. The present study points out towards the beneficial effect of epigallocatechin gallate in the amelioration of chronic fatigue syndrome and thus may provide a new, effective and powerful strategy to treat chronic fatigue syndrome."
"The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) participates in several higher order cognitive functions and is involved in the regulation of the stress response. The infralimbic cortex (ILC), the most ventral part of the mPFC, receives a strong afferent input from the master circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus. This fact raises the possibility that, similarly to stress, the diurnal rhythm may affect structural plasticity of neurons in the ILC. Here we investigated, whether diurnal changes in combination with immobilization stress have any impact on the dendritic morphology of layer III pyramidal neurons in the ILC. Prefrontal cortices were collected from control rats at two different time points of the diurnal cycle (12h apart), and from rats exposed to 1-week of daily restraint stress either during their active or resting period. Dendritic architecture and spine density of Golgi-Cox stained neurons were digitally reconstructed and analyzed. We found that in control rats during the active period, the basilar dendrites were always longer and more complex, and had more spines than during the resting period. Similar although less pronounced diurnal differences exist in the apical dendrites. Stress affected dendritic architecture in a way that the diurnal differences either disappeared or became reduced in their magnitude. Our findings indicate that the diurnal rhythm has a unique impact on the structural plasticity of pyramidal cells in the ILC and that stress interferes with this form of neuroplasticity."
"A growing body of literature suggests that sex differences exist in both rodents and humans in terms of the central processing of stress and emotion, and an important factor in this regard may involve differential hemispheric specialization. The amygdala has been shown to be functionally asymmetrical in both rats and humans and its involvement in stress and emotion processing is well documented. Given that amygdala function is importantly modulated by dopamine (DA), the present study examined the effects of left vs. right unilateral DAergic depletion targeting the basolateral amygdala in male and female rats. We examined behaviour in the elevated plus maze over two consecutive days, and plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels in response to a separate 30min restraint stress. Overall, females showed significantly more exploration of open arms of the plus maze than males, while not differing in general activity reflected in closed arm entries. Significant SexxHemisphere interactions were observed for all measures related to open arm exploration, as right amygdala DA depletion produced an anxiolytic effect in males, increasing open arm exploration, but reduced this behaviour in females. Moreover, open arm exploration was greatly reduced on the second maze exposure in males, but unchanged in females. A SexxHemisphere interaction was also found for plasma ACTH levels. It is suggested that the role of amygdala DA on stress-related behaviour and physiology reflects inherent differences in amygdala function dependent on both sex and hemisphere."
"Central administration of neuropeptide S (NPS) in rodents induces arousal and prolonged wakefulness as well as anxiolytic-like effects. NPS has also been implicated in modulation of cognitive functions and energy homeostasis. Here we present a comprehensive phenotypical analysis of mice carrying a targeted mutation in the NPS receptor (NPSR) gene. NPSR knockout mice were found to exhibit reduced exploratory activity when challenged with a novel environment, which might indicate attenuated arousal. We also observed attenuated late peak wheel running activity in NPSR knockout mice, representing reduced activity during the subjective evening. These mice also displayed increased anxiety-like behaviors when compared to their wildtype littermates, although analysis of anxiety behaviors was limited by genetic background influences. Unexpectedly, NPSR knockout mice showed enhanced motor performance skills. No phenotypical differences were detected in the forced-swim test, startle habituation and pre-pulse inhibition paradigms. Together, these data indicate that the endogenous NPS system might be involved in setting or maintaining behavioral arousal thresholds and that the NPS system might have other yet undiscovered physiological functions."
"Set-shifting in a T-maze task was assessed in rats with a neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion (NVHL), a proposed animal model of schizophrenia. NVHL animals tested as adults were impaired in shifting to a new rule; an increase in perseverative errors suggested that this impairment stemmed from an inability to suppress the previously learned strategy. The NVHL animals' performance is reminiscent of humans with prefrontal damage and patients with schizophrenia."
"Several executive functions rely on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the rat. Aspiration and neurotoxic lesions of the mPFC impair reversal learning in adult rats. Systemic administration of MK-801, an NMDA-receptor antagonist, impairs T-maze reversal learning in weanling rats but the role of mPFC NMDA-receptor antagonism in this effect is not known in either adult or young animals. This set of studies showed that mPFC NMDA receptors are specifically involved in T-maze discrimination reversal in weanling rats. In Experiment 1, 26-day-old rats (P26) demonstrated a dose-dependent impairment following bilateral mPFC administration of either 2.5 or 5.0microg MK-801 or saline (vehicle) during the reversal training phase only. In Experiment 2, P26 rats were trained on the same task, but four groups of rats received bilateral mPFC infusions during acquisition only (MK-SAL), reversal only (SAL-MK), both phases (MK-MK), or neither phase (SAL-SAL). MK-801 impaired performance only when infused during reversal. This suggests that NMDA-receptor antagonism in the mPFC is selectively involved in reversal learning during development and this may account for the previously reported effects of systemic MK-801 on T-maze discrimination reversal in weanling rats."
"Depression and anxiety tend to be the most prevalent conditions among the multitude of neurobehavioural disorders which cause distress in the survivors of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The objective of the present investigation was to examine depression-like and anxiety-like behaviour of rats following diffuse TBI. Impact accelerated TBI was induced in anaesthetised rats by a modified weight drop method. TBI and sham-operated rats received either a chronic (14 days) regimen of escitalopram (5-20 mg/kg) or vehicle, following which they were subjected to a behavioural test battery. The results evince the depression-like behaviour of TBI rats in modified open field exploration, hyperemotionality, socio-sexual interaction and elevated plus-maze exploration paradigms. In addition, an anxiety-like behaviour was evident in social interaction and marble-burying tests. Chronic escitalopram (10 and 20 mg/kg) treatment significantly attenuated the TBI associated behavioural deficits. In conclusion, the aforesaid behavioural anomalies observed in TBI rats are analogous to comorbid anxiety and depression in humans. These findings substantiate the TBI rats as a candidate model of comorbid anxiety and depression."
"The objective of this experiment was to examine the rewarding effect of electrical stimulation of the external lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBe) and of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) in concurrent Conditioned Place Preference (cCPP) and Brain Self-Stimulation Rewarding tasks. As expected, LH-stimulated animals readily learned cCPP tasks and developed self-stimulation behaviours following the rate-frequency procedure. As previously demonstrated, stimulation of the parabrachial complex generated rewarding or aversive behaviours in cCPP procedures. However, stimulation of this subnucleus induced consistent cCPP behaviours but not brain self-stimulation in rewarding LPBe animals. These results are analysed in the context of the different natural and artificial rewarding effects found in the LPBe nucleus."
"The rat is an altricial species and consequently undergoes considerable postnatal development. Careful analysis of the emergence and disappearance of motor behaviours is essential to gain insight into the temporal pattern of maturation of motor system structures. This study presents a qualitative analysis of the developmental progression of skilled movement in the rat by using a skilled walking task. A new rung bridge task was used to expose rat pups to a novel environment in order to reveal their potential capabilities. Ten rat pups were filmed daily from postnatal day 7 through postnatal day 30 as they explored the rung bridge task. Discrete changes in skilled and non-skilled walking in fore- and hind-limbs were evaluated by scoring seven categories and 24 subcategories of motor behaviour, including limb flexion and extension, coordination, posture, sensorimotor responses, distal control, and tail use in rat pups. Frame-by-frame analysis of ambulatory movement revealed six distinct stages of locomotor development. The most significant transformation to mature gait patterns was found between postnatal days 15 and 19, and maturation of all motor behaviour was completed by postnatal day 27. The findings are discussed in relation to the maturation of underlying structures and their relevance to studies of brain damage."
"Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is suggested to reflect a basic inhibitory mechanism which regulates sensory input to the brain, preventing sensory overload and cognitive fragmentation. However, studies directly investigating the relationship between PPI and cognition have produced inconsistent findings; this is likely to be due to the use of uninstructed PPI tasks, and limitations with the methods for measurement of PPI and startle. Therefore, the current study examined the relationship between cognitive performance and attentional modulation of PPI, using novel methods for the measurement of PPI. PPI was measured in 44 patients with schizophrenia and 32 healthy controls, across a range of startling stimulus intensities, under two attention set conditions. A range of neuropsychological tasks was also administered. Curves of best fit were fitted to the startle magnitudes, across the stimulus intensities, and a number of parameters were extracted from these curves, each of which reflects a different characteristic of the startle response. Correlations and quartile splits of the sample (highest versus lowest PPI) revealed that more PPI of response measures and less PPI of stimulus measures under the IGNORE condition was associated with superior performance in the colour-word subtest of the Stroop task. Further, more PPI of stimulus measures and less PPI of response measures under the ATTEND condition was associated with better performance on a memory task. These relationships appear to be mediated by common attentional processes active within both PPI and cognitive tasks, rather than by common underlying neurophysiological inhibitory processes."
"More intelligent persons (high IQ) typically present a higher cortical activity during tasks requiring the encoding of visuo-spatial information, namely higher alpha (about 10 Hz) event-related desynchronization (ERD; Doppelmayr et al., 2005). The opposite is true (""neural efficiency"") during the retrieval of the encoded information, as revealed by both lower alpha ERD and/or lower theta (about 5 Hz) event-related synchronization (ERS; Grabner et al., 2004). To reconcile these contrasting results, here we evaluated the working hypothesis that more intelligent male subjects are characterized by a high cortical activity during the encoding phase. This deep encoding would explain the relatively low cortical activity for the retrieval of the encoded information. To test this hypothesis, electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded in 22 healthy young male volunteers during visuo-spatial information processing (encoding) and short-term retrieval of the encoded information. Cortical activity was indexed by theta ERS and alpha ERD. It was found that the higher the subjects' total IQ, the stronger the frontal theta ERS during the encoding task. Furthermore, the higher the subjects' total IQ, the lower the frontal high-frequency alpha ERD (about 10-12 Hz) during the retrieval task. This was not true for parietal counterpart of these EEG rhythms. These results reconcile previous contrasting evidence confirming that more intelligent persons do not ever show event-related cortical responses compatible with ""neural efficiency"" hypothesis. Rather, their cortical activity would depend on flexible and task-adapting features of frontal activation."
"Glutamate transmission is essential for learning and memory. Several studies have shown that exercise can up-regulate the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in normal brain, thus enhancing glutamate release through the synaptic-associated protein synapsin I in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of treadmill training on the release of these factors in the striatum and on the motor function in both normal and brain-ischemic rats. Rats were randomly assigned to normal and brain-ischemic groups. Those in the brain-ischemic group underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1 h. Fifty percent of the rats in each group underwent treadmill training for 14 days. The rest remained relatively inactive for 14 days and served as the control groups. Motor function was assessed by performing three motor tests (foot-fault-placing, parallel-bar-crossing, and ladder-climbing tests). Our data showed that after treadmill training, motor function improved significantly in both normal and brain-ischemic rats when compared with the corresponding controls. The levels of glutamate, BDNF, and p-synapsin I were also up-regulated by treadmill training. These results suggested that the overall responses to treadmill training were similar in both normal and brain-ischemic rats. The beneficial effects of treadmill training might be partly due to the involvement of glutamate in neuronal activity in both brain-ischemic and normal rats."
"Previous research has demonstrated age-related decline in spatial navigation skills. However, spatial navigation is a complex ability that requires the integration of many component processes that may show differential susceptibility to aging. In particular, successful navigation depends on the accurate computation of distance and direction from self-generated movements through the environment, known as path integration. In the present study, we utilized virtual environments (VE) to investigate age-related differences in participants' ability to determine linear distances, angular rotations, and angular displacement exclusively from visual input. Results indicated that for shorter lengths, distances can be gauged from visual input alone with relative equivalence between older and younger participants. As distances increased, however, older individuals were less accurate. There were no age differences in estimating angular rotations. Requiring simultaneous integration of distance and rotation (in a triangle completion homing task) resulted in robust age-differences independent of the absolute amount of displacement. For older adults, accuracy in the triangle completion task was highly related to their rotation accuracy while returning to the point of origin, and less so to their distance accuracy. This study demonstrated age-related deficits in the ability to perform visual return-to-origin tasks and suggests one way in which elderly navigation performance may be compromised."
"Taking into account that most of the experimental research into the effects of antipsychotic drugs has mainly focused on behavioural aspects, the aim of the present work is to investigate the effects of a chronic therapeutic dose of risperidone (1 mg/kg/day during 140 days) on both behavioural and morphological aspects in healthy rats. The behavioural results revealed only minor modifications in prepulse inhibition, showing the risperidone-treated group higher values at 70 days of treatment with respect to the vehicle group. Moreover, in the open-field test, this group showed a greater incidence of grooming. In the active avoidance test, no differences were found between the groups studied. Additionally, in the morphological study performed to analyse cortical thickness and the number of GFAP-, CaBP-, PV- and Fos-immunostained cells no differences were seen between the two groups studied. It is important to note that the risperidone-treated group showed a slight increase in the total number of cells counted, although this increase was not significant. Our results indicate that the chronic administration of therapeutic doses of risperidone does not produce any dramatic behavioural or morphological changes in healthy animals."
"Drugs that facilitate dopaminergic neurotransmission induce cognitive and attentional deficits which include inability to filter sensory input measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI). Methylphenidate, an amphetamine analog is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Given that nitric oxide (NO) modulates dopamine effect our aim is to analyze the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) inhibitors effect on PPI disruption induced by methylphenidate. The inhibitors effects were compared to those produced by haloperidol and clozapine. Male Swiss mice received a first i.p. injection (one hour before testing), of either saline, or N(G) nitro l-arginine (10, 40 or 90 mg/kg), or 7-Nitroindazole (3, 10, 30 or 60 mg/kg), or oxadiazolo-quinoxalin (5 or 10 mg/kg), or haloperidol (1 mg/kg), or clozapine (5 mg/kg). Thirty min later mice received the second injection of either saline or methylphenidate (20 or 30 mg/kg) or amphetamine (5 or 10 mg/kg). One group of mice received intracerebroventricular 7-Nitroindazole (50 or 100 nM) followed by systemic administration of saline or methylphenidate (30 mg/kg). The results revealed a methylphenidate dose-dependent disruption of PPI comparable to amphetamine. The effect was prevented by either nitric oxide synthase or guanilate cyclase inhibitors or clozapine or haloperidol. In conclusion, methylphenidate induced a dose-dependent PPI disruption in Swiss mice modulated by dopamine and NO/sGC. The results corroborate the hypothesis of dopamine and NO interacting to modulate sensorimotor gating through central nervous system. It may be useful to understand methylphenidate and other psychostimulants effects."
"The single platform-on-water (flower pot) method is extensively used for depriving rapid eye movement sleep (REMS). Detailed comparison of sleep-wake architecture, recorded during the rebound period after spending three days on either a small or large platform, could separate the effects of REMS deficit from other stress factors caused by the procedure. A further aim of the study was to find the most characteristic REMS parameter of the rebound originating from REMS deficit. Rats were kept on a small or large platform for 72 h. Their fronto-parietal electroencephalogram, electromyogram and motility were recorded during the 24 h rebound at the beginning of the passive phase. A similar period of a home cage group was also recorded. The most typical differences between the two rebound groups were the increased cumulative time and longer average duration of REMS episodes without significant change in the number of these episodes of the small platform animals during the passive phase. Results obtained by cosinor analysis were in accordance with the findings above. Since we did not find any difference in the average duration of REMS episodes comparing the large platform rebound group and the home cage group, we concluded that the increased mean duration of REMS episodes is a selective marker for the rebound caused by small platform sleep deprivation, while other changes in sleep architecture may be the consequence of stress and also some sleep deficit."
"The early rearing environment programs corticolimbic function and neuroendocrine stress reactivity in adulthood. Although early environmental programming of innate fear has been previously examined, its impact on fear learning and memory later in life remains poorly understood. Here we examined the role of the early rearing environment in programming fear conditioning and extinction in adult male rats. Pups were subjected to maternal separation (MS; 360 min), brief handling (H; 15 min), or animal facility rearing (AFR) on post-natal days 2-14. As adults, animals were tested in a 3-day fear learning and memory paradigm which assessed the acquisition, expression and extinction of fear conditioning to an auditory cue; the recall of extinction was also assessed. In addition, contextual fear was assessed prior to cued extinction and its recall. We found that the acquisition of fear conditioning to the cue was modestly impaired by MS. However, no early rearing group differences were observed in cue-induced fear expression. In contrast, both the rate of extinction and extinction recall were attenuated by H. Finally, although contextual fear was reduced after extinction to the cue, no differences in context-induced fear were observed between the early rearing groups. These results add to a growing body of evidence supporting an important role for early environmental programming of fear conditioning and extinction. They also indicate that different early rearing conditions can program varying effects on distinct fear learning and memory processes in adulthood."
"Identifying the mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of developmental neurotoxicants enables the design of therapies that can potentially reverse neurobehavioral deficits in adulthood. We administered chlorpyrifos (CPF), a model organophosphate pesticide to pregnant mice and identified visuospatial deficits in adult offspring using performance in the Morris maze. We then evaluated two strategies to reverse the effects, nicotine administration and transplantation of neural stem cells. Daily administration of nicotine prior to behavioral testing did not alter maze performance by itself, but completely reversed the deficits evoked by prenatal CPF exposure. Similarly, control animals grafted with neural stem cells in adolescence did not show any alterations in behavioral performance as adults, but the grafts completely reversed the effects of prenatal CPF treatment. This study thus provides a model for the development and application of both pharmacologic and cell-based therapies to offset the effects of neurobehavioral teratogens."
"The delayed reaction paradigm, consisting to discover two different rules consecutively (delayed alternation and non-alternation task) followed by a delayed reversal task, is a specific marker for the functioning of primate prefrontal cortex. Although several works in rodents report the use of operant delayed alternation tasks, in none of the studies mice with lesion of the prefrontal cortex were used in this paradigm. In the current study, mouse experiments were conducted using a new, totally automated device, the olfactory H-maze. Here, we show that unilateral lesion of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in mice induced similar deficits to those observed after frontal lesions in monkeys and humans. These pronounced learning deficits seem to come from difficulty elaborating a new rule and the inability to inhibit the previous rule, characterized by perseveration after prefrontal cortex lesion. The present results demonstrate that this very simple experimental paradigm using the olfactory H-maze presents the advantage to be fast (one training session) and well suited to assess the frontal functions in mice. It should be useful for testing pharmacological or stem cell approaches in order to reduce organic damages or gain insight into the cognitive functions of the frontal cortex using transgenic or gene-targeting mice."
