Abstract
"Many studies have demonstrated that aging is associated with declines in skill acquisition. In the current study, we tested whether older adults could acquire general, transferable knowledge about skill learning processes. Older adult participants learned five different motor tasks. Two older adult control groups performed the same number of trials, but learned only one task. The experimental group exhibited faster learning than that seen in the control groups. These data demonstrate that older adults can learn to learn new motor skills."
"Previously, we reported that lateral hypothalamic (LH) orexin neurons are stimulated in proportion to the preference shown for reward-associated cues during conditioned place preference (CPP) testing. Here, we examine for the first time the role of these neurons in the acquisition of morphine CPP. Results show that LH orexin neurons, but not those in the perifornical area (PFA), are stimulated during conditioning when morphine is given in a novel drug-paired environment (CPP compartment) but not when given in the home cage, nor when saline was given in the CPP environment. Furthermore, bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the LH orexin area completely blocked the acquisition of morphine CPP. Lesions that spared LH orexin neurons had no effect. Orexin neurons in the LH project to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), an area important in the acquisition of morphine CPP. Therefore, we investigated the importance of the LH orexin connection to the VTA in the acquisition of a morphine CPP using a disconnection technique involving a unilateral excitotoxic lesion of LH orexin neurons and contralateral blockade of VTA orexin receptors. Results indicated that a unilateral LH orexin lesion together with a microinjection of the orexin A antagonist (SB 334867) into the contralateral VTA prior to each morphine-pairing session was sufficient to block the development of a morphine CPP. Either of these treatments by themselves was not sufficient to block CPP development. These results demonstrate the importance of LH orexin neurons and their projections to the VTA in the formation of associations between environmental cues and drug reward."
"Investigations using selective lesion techniques suggest that the septohippocampal cholinergic system may not be critical for spatial orientation. These studies employ spatial tasks that provide the animal with access to both environmental and self-movement cues; therefore, intact performance may reflect spared spatial orientation or compensatory mechanisms associated with one class of spatial cues. The present study investigated the contribution of the septohippocampal cholinergic system to spatial behavior by examining performance in foraging tasks in which cue availability was manipulated. Thirteen female Long-Evans rats received selective lesions of the medial septum/vertical band with 192 IgG saporin, and 11 received sham surgeries. Rats were trained to forage for hazelnuts in an environment with access to both environmental and self-movement cues (cued condition). Manipulations include altering availability of environmental cues associated with the refuge (uncued probe), removing all visual environmental cues (dark probe), and placing environmental and self-movement cues into conflict (reversal probe). Medial septum lesions disrupted homeward segment topography only under conditions in which self-movement cues were critical for organizing food hoarding behavior (dark and reversal). These results are consistent with medial septum lesions producing a selective impairment in self-movement cue processing and suggest that these rats were able to compensate for deficits in self-movement cue processing when provided access to environmental cues."
"The cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) is a sialoglycoprotein involved in neuroplasticity processes and synaptic transmission. This study investigated behavioural responses (balance in the rota-rod test at 24 rpm, motility in the open-field test, anxiety in the elevated plus-maze test) in Zurich developed wild-type adult mice (WT, controls of normal PrP(C) expression), in knockout (KO) mice (Prnp(0/0), with no PrP(C) expression), and in PrP(C) overexpressing Tg-20 mice. After 8 min in the rota-rod test, Tg-20 animals presented significantly fewer falls (1.08+/-1.56 falls) than both WT (7.27+/-4.36) and KO (7.6+/-6.15) mice (p&lt;0.01). In the open field test, Tg-20 animals showed significantly increased motility [rearing=23.4+/-7.85, crossing=97.30+/-32.11) when compared with KO mice (rearing=5.45+/-3.69 and crossing=59.73+/-15.43) or WT mice (rearing=6.5+/-20.23 and crossing=45.18+/-20.33) (p&lt;0.01). In the elevated plus-maze test, Tg-20 mice showed less anxiety (head projections=7.3+/-1.62) when compared with WT animals (3.38+/-0.67) (p&lt;0.05). Moreover, KO mice spent more time in the centre of the plus maze (37.80+/-5.57 s) than did WT mice (22.57+/-3.82) (p&lt;0.05). PrP(C) overexpressing mice evoked increased motility, less anxiety, and increased equilibrium when compared with WT control animals in the behavioural protocols used. KO animals also tended to evoke fewer anxiety-related responses in the elevated plus-maze test. These findings indicate that the levels of PrP(C) in adult life are associated with possible changes in motility, anxiety, and equilibrium."
"The present study has been designed to investigate the effect of amniotic fluid derived stem cells on focal cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion injury induced behavioural deficits in mice. Middle cerebral artery occlusion of 60 min followed by reperfusion for 7 days was employed in present study to produce ischaemia and reperfusion induced cerebral injury in mice. Assessment of cognitive behaviour was done using elevated plus maze. Assessment of neurological severity score was employed to assess motor, sensory, reflex, and balance tests in a composite manner. Adhesive-removal somatosensory test was employed to evaluate somatosensory deficit. Partial occlusion of middle cerebral artery markedly impaired memory, motor coordination, sensorimotor ability and somatosensory functions as inferred from the results of elevated plus-maze test, adhesive-removal test and neurological severity score test. Intracerebroventricular administration of amniotic fluid derived stem cells/embryonic neuronal stem cells significantly reversed the focal cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion induced behavioural deficit measured in terms of loss of short-term memory, motor coordination, sensorimotor ability and somatosensory functions. Therefore, it may be concluded that stem cells derived from amniotic fluid exert beneficial effect on the ischaemic brain to an extent comparable to the neuroprotective effect of embryonic neuronal stem cells."
"We exposed mouse pups to an early social enrichment, the communal nest (CN), to study the effects of the early social experiences on adult brain function and behavior. CN, which consists of a single nest where three mothers keep their pups together and share care-giving behavior from birth to weaning (postnatal day 25), mimics the natural ecological niche of the mouse species. In order to better characterize the previously reported effect of CN on social behavior and to evaluate the extent to which the effects of the CN tend to be pervasive across different behavioral competences, we carried out both a detailed analysis of home-cage social behavior, taking into account the time of the day and absence/presence of an established social hierarchy, and of learning and memory abilities in the water maze. Home-cage observations revealed that, when the hierarchy is established, CN mice display higher levels of social investigation behavior, namely allogrooming and allosniffing, compared to mice reared in standard laboratory conditions (SN). However, when exposed to cage cleaning, a stimulus challenging social hierarchy, CN mice display higher levels of offensive behavior. In the water maze test, CN mice showed a performance similar to that of SN mice. Overall, the present findings confirm that CN mice have elaborate social competencies displaying high levels of aggressive behavior when needed to set up or defend their own territory. Furthermore, present data suggest that the early social enrichment specifically affect adult social behavior but not learning and memory abilities."
"Whilst dysfunction of basal ganglia-thalamic circuitry is implicated in the genesis of parkinsonian symptomatology, few studies have examined the effects of lesioning the motor thalamus in the context of parkinsonism. Forty rats were therefore subdivided into four lesion groups each of 10 rats with lesions or sham surgery targeting (1) the medial forebrain bundle and/or (2) motor thalamus, resulting in: Sham/Sham, 6-OHDA/Sham, Sham/NMDA and 6-OHDA/NMDA groups. Behavioural testing was performed prior to any surgery and after each surgery including analysis of posture, drug-induced rotation, sensorimotor and autonomic deficits. As expected 6-OHDA lesions induced abnormalities in posture, locomotion, sensorimotor and pilomotor function, ipsilateral and contralateral rotational asymmetries after amphetamine and apomorphine, respectively. These behavioural changes reflect parkinsonism in this model. Additional thalamic lesions virtually abolished apomorphine-induced rotational asymmetry and improved sensorimotor response latency to tactile stimulation on the contralateral side. These data support the contribution of dysfunctional motor thalamic circuitry in rotational asymmetry and abnormal sensorimotor function in parkinsonian rats."
"Numerous peripheral and hypothalamic peptides control food intake. Among these signals are orexin, an orexigenic molecule released into the olfactory bulb by centrifugal hypothalamic fibres and leptin, an anorexigenic molecule that is released peripherally and can pass through the blood-brain barrier. In the present study, we injected either orexin or leptin, intracerebroventricularly, and their effect on olfactory performance was evaluated in two groups of rats, using a behavioral paradigm based on conditioned olfactory aversion. Rats were made aversive to water odorized with isoamyl acetate (ISO) at 10(-5) (1microl in 100ml of water). One group was injected with orexin versus saline and the other with leptin versus saline. They were then presented with different concentrations (lower than 10(-5)) of ISO-odorized water to compare their ability to avoid the ISO-drink. Orexin decreased ISO-drink consumption, showing increased avoidance of the ISO concentrations tested which ranged from 10(-9) to 10(-7). Conversely, the administration of leptin resulted in a dose dependant increase in the odorized-drink consumption for ISO 10(-10). Orexin therefore increases and leptin decreases olfactory sensitivity. Orexin and leptin modulate the olfactory performance in a similar way as do physiological induced fasting and satiation and appear to be important factors in the interdependency of olfaction and food intake."
"Several studies have suggested a positive relationship between circulating corticosterone levels and contextual conditioning. However, a positive relationship between circulating corticosterone levels and cued conditioning has also been reported. This study further investigates the relationship between corticosterone and fear conditioning by modulating the predictive value of contextual and discrete tone cues in separate groups of rats. In a first experiment in which training parameters were chosen to induce strong conditioning (five foot-shocks), we used a correlational approach and investigated whether post-training corticosterone levels were related to subsequent expression of contextual and/or tone fear. In a second experiment, in which training parameters were chosen to induce lower conditioning (one and two foot-shocks), we investigated whether a post-training corticosterone injection enhanced the consolidation of contextual and/or tone conditioning. In the first experiment, the highest post-training corticosterone levels were obtained in rats trained with paired tones and shocks. Post-training corticosterone levels tended to be positively correlated with freezing scores during the tone-fear test and were negatively correlated with freezing scores during training although not during the context-fear test. In the second experiment, a post-training injection of corticosterone (3mg/kg) had no effect on subsequent freezing to contextual cues and to a tone that did not predict shock, whereas it was efficient in increasing fear conditioned to a predictive tone. Globally, these results suggest that the predictive value of the conditioned stimulus may be the main determinant of the facilitatory action of acutely enhanced corticosterone in fear conditioning."
"The present study investigated the effects of intracebroventricular injections of 192 IgG-saporin in 7-day-old rats on (i) ultrasound vocalizations (USVs) on postnatal day (pnd) 13 following isolation and reunion with the mother and (ii) fear conditioning on pnd 18-19 recording both freezing and other behavioural responses as well as USVs. On pnd 13 lesioned and control pups showed comparable USV baseline values; a brief reunion with the mother induced a significant increase in USVs in all rats (maternal potentiation). On pnd 18, during the fear conditioning training, 192 IgG-saporin rats emitted a lower number of USVs. On pnd 19 all rats showed a stronger conditioned response (with full inhibition of locomotion) to auditory than to contextual cues. Surprisingly, lesioned rats showed a stronger fear-conditioned response to contextual cues than controls. These results suggest that early selective removal of the cholinergic basal forebrain paradoxically enhances hippocampally dependent fear-conditioned responses on pnd 19."
"Crocus sativus L. is a plant cultivated in various parts of the world. Its involvement in learning and memory processes has been proposed. Crocins are water-soluble carotenoids and are among the active components of C. sativus L. The present study was designed to investigate in the rat the effects of crocins on recognition and spatial memory. For this aim, the object recognition task which evaluates non-spatial working memory and a novel version of the radial water maze which assesses spatial reference and spatial working memory were chosen. In a first study, crocins (15 and 30mg/kg) counteracted delay-dependent recognition memory deficits in the normal rat, suggesting that these carotenoids modulate storage and/or retrieval of information. In a subsequent study, treatment with crocins (30mg/kg and to a lesser extent also 15mg/kg) attenuated scopolamine (0.2mg/kg)-induced performance deficits in the radial water maze test. The present results support and extend the enhancing effects of crocins on memory and, then, to our knowledge, for the first time, demonstrate its implication in the mechanisms underlying recognition and spatial memory."
"The effects on latent inhibition (LI; a delay in conditioning when a CS has been pre-exposed without consequences) of repeated restraint stress and the anxiolytic drug diazepam were examined in C57BL/6 mice to know whether previous aversive events or anxiolysis are factors determining the expression of LI. The LI model was optimized for this strain particularly sensitive to stress (using both the CER and the conditioned freezing procedures) and characterized with typical (haloperidol) and atypical (clozapine and olanzapine) antipsychotic drugs administered either during the conditioning or the pre-exposure phases. An acute challenge with amphetamine, a dopamine releaser, was done to verify the enhancement of hyperactivity in C57BL/6 mice after the restraint stress sensitization. At all doses tested, diazepam decreased latent inhibition when administered during the pre-exposure phase (similarly to atypical antipsychotic drugs). Repeated restraint stress enhanced LI by blocking the CS-induced freezing in pre-exposed mice. In contrast, pre-treatment with diazepam before pre-exposure allowed the expression of CS-induced freezing in stressed mice pre-exposed to the tone. It is suggested that stress and anxiolytic drugs can have opposite effects on attention or perseveration processes during learning of conflicting contingency responses."
"alpha2-Adrenoceptor activation with moxonidine (alpha2-adrenergic/imidazoline receptor agonist) into the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) enhances angiotensin II/hypovolaemia-induced sodium intake and drives cell dehydrated rats to ingest hypertonic sodium solution besides water. Angiotensin II and osmotic signals are suggested to stimulate meal-induced water intake. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the effects of bilateral injections of moxonidine into the LPBN on food deprivation-induced food intake and on meal-associated water and 0.3M NaCl intake. Male Holtzman rats with cannulas implanted bilaterally into the LPBN were submitted to 14 or 24h of food deprivation with water and 0.3M NaCl available (n=6-14). Bilateral injections of moxonidine (0.5nmol/0.2microl) into the LPBN increased meal-associated 0.3M NaCl intake (11.4+/-3.0ml/120min versus vehicle: 2.2+/-0.9ml/120min), without changing food intake (11.1+/-1.2g/120min versus vehicle: 11.2+/-0.9g/120min) or water intake (10.2+/-1.5ml/120min versus vehicle: 10.4+/-1.2ml/120min) by 24h food deprived rats. When no food was available during the test, moxonidine (0.5nmol) into the LPBN of 24h food-deprived rats produced no change in 0.3M NaCl intake (1.0+/-0.6ml/120min versus vehicle: 1.8+/-1.1ml/120min), nor in water intake (0.2+/-0.1ml/120min versus vehicle: 0.6+/-0.3ml/120min). The results suggest that signals generated during a meal, like dehydration, for example, not hunger, induce hypertonic NaCl intake when moxonidine is acting in the LPBN. Thus, activation of LPBN inhibitory mechanisms seems necessary to restrain sodium intake during a meal."
"Recent results in animal models suggest that thrombin may modulate brain injury in Parkinson's disease (PD). High doses of thrombin ( approximately 20U) can damage dopaminergic neurons, while we have found that low dose thrombin (1U), given several days before a brain insult (thrombin preconditioning), is protective in models of PD and stroke. However, the effects of such low levels of thrombin at the time of, or after, exposure to the dopamine neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) have not been examined and are the focus of this study. In the first set of experiments, rats received co-administration of thrombin (1U) or saline and 6-OHDA (5microg) into the medial forebrain bundle. 6-OHDA+thrombin resulted in striking increases in behavioral deficits, compared to 6-OHDA+saline. Similarly, co-administration of an agonist to protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1, a thrombin receptor, also resulted in significantly greater behavioral deficits. In a second set of experiments, thrombin (1U) or saline was administered 1 or 7 days after 6-OHDA to determine the effects of thrombin after 6-OHDA. Surprisingly, the rats that received saline had strikingly increased behavioral and neurochemical deficits resulting from the 6-OHDA lesion, while delayed thrombin administration prevented this effect. The results indicate that thrombin has differential effects in the 6-OHDA model, dependent on the time of administration. The ability of a second cannula insertion with saline infusion to increase dramatically deficits raises questions as to what role physical injury to already susceptible cells might play in the pathogenesis of some cases of PD."
"Anxiolytic-like effect of diazepam is abolished by a previous exposure to four-plate test (FPT). Variations of temporal parameters: interval between trials and duration of Trial 1, with or without electric punishments allow characterizing factors which are responsible for this loss phenomenon. Complete spatial representation of FPT seems to be responsible of this one-trial tolerance, and needs at least a 30s exposure to the apparatus to be completed, with or without punishments."
"Changes in power in the mu frequency band (8-13Hz) of the electroencephalogram (EEG) is thought to indirectly reflect the activity of mirror neurons in premotor cortex. Activation of these neurons by self-performed, observed or imagined motor actions is assumed to produce asynchronous firing and a reduction in mu rhythm oscillation (referred to as mu suppression) in sensorimotor cortex. A recent fMRI study by Saygin et al. [Saygin AP, Wilson SM, Hagler Jr DJ, Bates E, Sereno MI. Point-light biological motion perception activates human premotor cortex. J Neurosci 2004;24:6181-8] revealed that the premotor brain regions containing mirror-neurons are also activated in response to point-light human motion. The perceived movement of these light cues are integrated into one percept of a complete human action (e.g. jumping jacks), rather than seen as individual moving lights. The present study examined whether recruitment of the mirror neuron system, as reflected in mu rhythm suppression, mediates recognition of point-light biological motion. Changes in mu power were recorded while subjects viewed point-light biological motion videos, matched scrambled versions of these animations, and visual white-noise (baseline). The results revealed that point-light biological animations produced mu suppression relative to baseline, while scrambled versions of these animations did not. This supports the hypothesis that the mirror neuron system is involved in inferring human actions by recovering object information from sparse input."
"This is the second in a series of studies that uses various configurations of the water radial arm to characterize the mnemonic systems in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) which is used frequently as a rodent model of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The first study indicated that SHR were impaired on a win-shift version of the task that required the use of spatial extra-maze cues to locate the hidden platform. The objective of the present study was to assess the performance of male SHR, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats on (i) a win-stay version of the task that requires the use of proximal cue-based visual discrimination, and (ii) a conditioned cue preference task that is considered a measure of affective conditioning. In the win-stay task, SHR made fewer total errors than WKY and SD at the beginning of testing and after reversal of the value of the cues. In the conditioned cue preference task, SHR spent a similar amount of time in both arms; whereas, SD and WKY spent significantly more time in the arm with the cue that was associated with the platform. These findings indicate that SHR are not impaired on either the acquisition or reversal of a cued visual discrimination task in the radial water maze, but are impaired in terms of their performance on an affective learning task."
"The aim of the present investigation was to compare the behavioural profiles in alcohol-preferring AA (Alko, alcohol) and alcohol-avoiding ANA (Alko, non-alcohol) rats. Twelve adult, alcohol-na&#xef;ve male AA and ANA rats were tested in the recently established multivariate concentric square field (MCSF) test. The more traditional open field and elevated plus-maze tests were used as reference tests. Six weeks after the initial MCSF test, a repeated testing was used to explore differences in acquired recognition after a previous experience. The results revealed distinct differences between the two lines. The ANA rats were generally more active in the three tests. In the MCSF, parameters of risk taking and shelter seeking indicated differences between the two lines. The ANA rats had higher shelter seeking behaviour and less risk taking behaviour than the AA rats. Repeated exposure to the MCSF caused a general decrease in activity and reduction in the number of visits to the various zones, especially evident in the ANA rats. The ANA rats showed more shelter seeking than the AA rats and also more shelter seeking than in the first trial, supporting an ""anxiety-like"" profile in these rats. In conclusion, the parameters related to risk taking and shelter seeking revealed obvious differences between AA and ANA rats. The higher risk taking behaviour seen in the AA rats might relate to their innate propensity for high voluntary alcohol intake. The results are discussed in relation to the reported neurobiological differences and in relation to other alcohol-preferring and alcohol-avoiding rat lines."
"The long-chain polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are abundantly present in the central nervous system and play an important role in cognitive functions such as learning and memory. We, therefore, investigated the effects of n-3 PUFA-depletion in rats (F2 generation) on the learning of an olfactory discrimination task, progressively acquired within a four-arm maze, and on the mRNA expression of some candidate genes, i.e., c-fos, Gir and glucose transporter (Glut1), which could reflect the level of cerebral activity. We observed that DHA contents were dramatically decreased in the olfactory bulb, the piriform cortex and the neocortex of n-3-depleted rats. Furthermore, the n-3 deficiency resulted in a mild olfactory learning impairment as these rats required more days to master the olfactory task compared to control rats. Real-time RT-PCR experiments revealed that the training induced the expression of c-fos mRNA in all the three regions of the brain whereas Gir and Glut1 mRNA were induced only in olfactory bulb and neocortex. However, such an increase was less marked in the n-3-deficient rats. Taken together, these results allow us to assume that the behavioural impairment in n-3-deficient rats is linked to the depletion of n-3 fatty acids in brain regions processing olfactory cues. Data are discussed in view of the possible role of some of these genes in learning-induced neuronal olfactory plasticity."
"The novel object recognition (NOR) task is a paradigm employed to detect both disruption and improvement of non-spatial memory in rats. PCP (phencyclidine) may be used to model aspects of schizophrenia symptomology in rats, in particular cognitive deficits. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of typical and atypical antipsychotics to improve a sub-chronic PCP-induced impairment in cognition using the NOR task. Female hooded-Lister rats (195+/-12 g) received either vehicle (0.9% saline twice daily) or PCP (2 mg/kg, twice daily) for 7 days followed by 7-days drug free. Haloperidol (0.05 and 0.075 mg/kg), clozapine (1 and 5mg/kg), risperidone (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg) or vehicle (veh, saline) was administered i.p. 30 min prior to testing. Rats completed an acquisition trial followed by an inter-trial interval of 1 min, then a retention trial. Following sub-chronic vehicle treatment, rats spent significantly (p&lt;0.05) more time exploring the novel compared to the familiar object, an effect that was abolished in the sub-chronic PCP treated animals. Clozapine (1.0 and 5.0 mg/kg) and risperidone (0.2 mg/kg) but not haloperidol significantly attenuated the PCP-induced impairment such that animals again spent significantly more time exploring the novel compared with familiar object (p&lt;0.05). These results support our earlier work showing that acute PCP induces a robust object recognition deficit in female rats. Clozapine and risperidone but not haloperidol showed efficacy to reverse the deficit induced by sub-chronic PCP suggesting that this test may have some validity for assessing efficacy for improvement of cognitive deficit symptoms of schizophrenia."
"An event-related potential (ERP) with frontocentral negativity is known to be evoked by error responses, but may also occur on correct response trials. The error-related negativity (ERN) is thought to be generated in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The current study aimed to further elucidate its functional significance as well as its neuronal correlates by directly comparing its amplitude and time course on correct and error trials in a continuous performance task (CPT). Results yielded a frontocentral positive potential preceding correct responses and a high amplitude post-response frontocentral negative potential during conditions involving response competition. To remove potential no-confounding effects of the positive component preceding the motor response, a second experiment was conducted where a red fixation cross served as a cue for potential response competition tendencies. Again, results yielded highest post-response amplitudes on correct trials involving response competition. The positive pre-response potential was eliminated by the visual cue. Interestingly, the cue led to an enhancement of the negative post-response component on trials without response competition. Taken together, the frontocentral post-response negativity might reflect evaluative rather than error-related processing."
"Manipulation of juvenile rats in a way that mimics the rough-and-tumble play and resembles tickling elicits 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) that have been proposed as a measure of positive affect. In the present experiments the stability of the 50-kHz USV response (chirping) over 1.5 months of daily manipulation and the effect of tickling was studied. By the second week of tickling rats of both sexes developed a level of 50-kHz USVs that remained individually characteristic. During tickling the rats also emitted low levels of 22-kHz USVs. No correlation was found between the two types of USVs. In tests used in anxiety and depression research, tickling on its own had an anxiolytic effect in many experimental settings. Significantly lower levels of [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding to the dopamine-activated receptor-G protein complex in striatum and serotonin transporter levels in the frontal cortex were found in female control rats as compared to males. These differences were eliminated by tickling. Rats which expressed high level of chirping (HC-rats) were similar to low-chirping (LC) rats in anxiety measures but had lower activity in an exploration test and lower sucrose preference. LC-rats adopted more active coping strategies in the forced swimming test. These findings suggest that there are individually characteristic 50-kHz USV response levels to tickling in rats, and that HC- and LC-rats are similar with regard to anxiety levels but have different coping strategies to novelty. The anxiolytic-like changes in behaviour that were brought about by tickling could be mediated by changes in dopamine- and serotonergic systems."
"This study investigates behavioural lateralization in sheep and lambs of different ages. A flock was tested in a task in which the animals were facing an obstacle and should avoid it on either the right or left side to rejoin flock-mates (adult sheep) or their mothers (lambs). A bias for avoiding the obstacle on the right side was observed, with lambs apparently being more lateralized than sheep. This right bias was tentatively associated with the left-hemifield laterality in familiar faces recognition which has been documented in this species. Differences between adult sheep and lambs were likely to be due to differences in social reinstatement motivation elicited by different stimuli (flock-mates or mothers) at different ages. Preferential use of the forelegs to step on a wood-board and direction of jaw movement during rumination was also tested in adult animals. No population bias nor individual-level lateralization was observed for use of the forelegs. At the same time, however, there was a large number of animals showing individual-level lateralization for the direction of jaw movement during rumination even though there was no population bias. These findings highlight that within the same species individual- and population-level lateralization can be observed in different tasks. Moreover, the results fit the general hypothesis that population-level asymmetries are more likely to occur in tasks that require social coordination among behaviourally asymmetric individuals."
"Neurobiologists are becoming increasingly interested in how complex cognitive representations are formed by the integration of sensory stimuli. To this end, discrimination tasks are frequently used to assess perceptual and cognitive processes in animals, because they are easy to administer and score, and the ability of an animal to make a particular discrimination establishes beyond doubt that the necessary perceptual/cognitive processes are present. It does not, however, follow that absence of discrimination means the animal cannot make a particular perceptual judgement; it may simply mean that the animal did not manage to discover the relevant discriminative stimulus when trying to learn the task. Here, it is shown that rats did not learn a cross-modal object discrimination (requiring association of each object's visual appearance with its odour) when trained on the complete task from the beginning. However, they could eventually make the discrimination when trained on the component parts step by step, showing that they were able to do the necessary cross-modal integration in the right circumstances. This finding adds to growing evidence that discrimination tasks tend to encourage feature-based discrimination, perhaps by engaging automatic, habit-based brain systems. Thus, they may not be the best way to assess the formation of multi-dimensional stimulus representations of the kind needed in more complex cognitive processes such as declarative memory. Instead, more natural tasks such as spontaneous exploration may be preferable."
"The present study evaluated the effects of NO mimetics on stress-induced neurobehavioral changes and the possible involvement of ROS-RNS interactions in rats. Restraint stress (RS) suppressed both percent open arm entries and time spent in the open arms in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test. These RS-induced changes in EPM activity were attenuated by the NO mimetics, l-arginine, isosorbide dinitrate and molsidomine, in a differential manner. RS-exposed rats showed (a) increased lipid peroxidation (MDA) and (b) lowered reduced glutathione (GSH) and NO metabolites (NOx), in brain homogenates of these animals. Pretreatment with the NO mimetics also differentially influenced RS-induced changes in brain oxidative stress markers. The results suggest that NO may protect against stress-induced anxiogenic behavior and oxidative injury in the brain and highlight the significance of ROS-RNS interactions."
"We have recently reported that rat/mouse hemokinin-1 (r/m HK-1), a mammalian tachykinin, produced dose- and time-related antinociceptive effects at the supraspinal level via activating NK(1) receptors. Moreover, r/m HK-1 remarkably enhanced both the antinociceptive extent and duration of morphine administered at the peripheral and supraspinal level through a convergence of pharmacological effects of opioid-responsive neurons. Pethidine hydrochloride is an important narcotic analgesic, which acts as an opiate agonist and has pharmacological effects similar to morphine. To improve our knowledge of the pharmacology of pethidine, the aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the nociception of r/m HK and pethidine by comparing it with that of r/m HK-1 and morphine. Our data showed that r/m HK-1 remarkably enhanced the antinociceptive extent of pethidine administered at the peripheral level, but not at the supraspinal level. These antinociceptive effects were blocked by prior treatment with the classical opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, indicating that the potentiated analgesic effect is mediated by opioid-responsive neurons. Differences in the antinociceptive activity of pethidine and morphine in combination with r/m HK-1, arise because there are differences in the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of pethidine and morphine, particularly their lipophilicity. Our results may pave the way for a new strategy for the control of pain and may provide a clinical strategy to enable selection of either opioid as a priority."
"Previous studies show that early life events result in neurobehavioural alterations that may be either beneficial or detrimental to the stress response. Given the close relationship between corticosterone secretion and mnemonic processes, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of brief (BMS, 15 min) and long maternal separations (LMS, 180 min) on memory tasks in adult rats, assessed by context and tone fear conditioning. At adulthood, males were evaluated for behavioural and hormonal reaction to the training environment, being tested for context fear conditioning; tone fear conditioning; and learning curve in the context fear conditioning, in which rats were daily re-exposed to the context, followed by a brief footshock and in the last day of the experiment (day 5) animals were exposed to the context. Corticosterone and ACTH plasma levels were determined in na&#xef;ve rats (basal) or 5, 25 or 45 min after each test. Peak ACTH and corticosterone levels were similar among the groups after context fear conditioning; however, levels of CTL rats remained elevated for a longer time. In the learning curve of context fear conditioning, both BMS and LMS rats exhibited less freezing behaviour than CTL rats, without differences in hormone secretion. There was neither an association between activity of the HPA axis and performance on memory tasks nor different activational properties of the tasks on the HPA axis between BMS and LMS rats, i.e., both manipulations lead to similar performance in hippocampus-dependent and independent memory tasks."
"Previous behavioural studies which have administered phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE5) inhibitors have consistently demonstrated improved retention. However, when young chicks were trained on a strongly reinforced passive avoidance task 100microM zaprinast caused two periods of transient retention loss. This is opposed to past findings and may suggest an effect on retrieval. It is hypothesised that the level of reinforcement is central to this phenomenon. The molecular corollary of this may be the need to maintain cGMP homeostasis such that strong reinforcement+zaprinast may impair retention through the production of excessive levels of cGMP. This was demonstrated by two challenge studies whereby increasing concentrations of 8-Br-cGMP were administered in the presence of the guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ (100microM; ic) resulting in an inverted ""U-shaped"" retention curve. These findings suggest a more complex role for PDE5 and cGMP in memory processing than previously described and question the role of PDE5 inhibitors as nootropes under all circumstances."
"Rats were randomly assigned to enriched (EE) or standard environments (SE) at 21 or 73 days of age, for 17 days. Half of the rats of each rearing condition were trained in a radial maze (RM). At 38 days (pre-pubertal) or 90 days (young), rats were sacrificed and brain cytosolic and mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase (mtNOS) activity was assayed. Western blot analysis of brain mtNOS was conducted. In the pre-pubertal group, EE rats improved their performance in the RM while SE rats did not. In the young group, SE and EE rats showed a random performance in the RM. In SE pre-pubertal rats, training increased brain cytosolic NOS and mtNOS activity by 68% and 82%. In EE non-trained pre-pubertal rats, brain cytosolic NOS and mtNOS activity increased by 80% and 60%, as compared with SE non-trained pre-pubertal rats. In EE pre-pubertal rats that were trained, brain cytosolic NOS and mtNOS activity increased by 70% and 90%, as compared with SE pre-pubertal rats that were not trained. A higher protein expression of brain mtNOS was found in EE rats, as compared with SE animals. Mitochondrial complex I activity was higher in EE than in SE rats. Training had no effect on complex I activity neither in SE nor in EE rats. In young rats, no significant differences in enzyme activities were found between EE and SE rats. These results support the hypothesis that brief exposure to EE and training produce effects on behavioral performance and on biochemical parameters in an age-dependent manner."
"Dopaminergic functional recovery following controlled release of dopamine from biodegradable polymer matrices implanted in the lesioned striatum was investigated in a hemiparkinsonian animal model. Significant dopamine depletion in the striatum ipsilateral to the side of infusion was observed in animals unilaterally infused with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in the substatia nigra. These animals displayed apomorphine-induced contralateral rotational behavior, when examined on the 16th day. Implantation of a controlled release delivery system (hydrogel obtained by mixing dextran dialdehyde cross-linked with gelatin) containing dopamine in the denervated striatum on the 1st day or the 18th day significantly abolished the apomorphine-induced contralateral rotational behavior in these animals. The recovery was visible for about 17 days, thereafter the behavioral bias reappeared. The present results indicate that dopamine released from the polymer matrices alleviates behavioral bias in experimental parkinsonism, implying use of such technologies as an alternative method for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. This approach is useful in reducing the oral dose of drugs that are with severe systemic effects, and that develop tolerance."
"If begun early in life, exercise effectively reduces the development of cognitive deficits in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the effectiveness of exercise, once the cognitive impairments are established, is not as clear. In terms of translating research in animal models to treatments involving exercise in Alzheimer's disease patients, it is critical to evaluate exercise intervention at time points that address not only prevention, but also treatment of cognitive decline. We provided exercise wheels to Tg2576 (TG) (n=12) and C57BL6 (WT) (n=17) mice at 16-18 months of age for three weeks. At this age animals have significant cognitive impairment and neuropathology consistent with AD. Age matched sedentary TG (n=13) and WT (n=12) mice were also included, as well as groups provided access to an immobile wheel (TG n=9, WT n=12). After three weeks, animals were evaluated in a radial arm water maze. Significant impairments were observed in the sedentary TG mice compared to WT in reference/long-term and working/short-term memory, as well as in probe trials. Exercised TG mice demonstrated improvements in memory, which made them indistinguishable from WT mice on all tasks. In addition, animals provided with an immobile wheel exhibited improvement in some, but not all cognitive measures. Our findings demonstrate that exercise can improve cognitive performance in a mouse model of AD even if applied after the development of pathology."
"This study investigated the effect of GABAA (muscimol, MUSC) and GABAB (baclofen, BACL) agonist receptors microinjected into medial accumbens shell on feeding and the level of fear in free-feeding rats submitted to the elevated plus-maze (EPM), an animal model of anxiety. Bilateral microinjections of either MUSC (128 pmol/0.2 microl/side) or BACL (128 and 256 pmol/0.2 microl/side) induced an anxiolytic-like effect since they decreased the occurrence of risk assessment, a defensive behaviour positively correlated with the animal anxiety level. Bilateral BACL microinjection (128 pmol), but not MUSC, also increased the head-dipping frequency over the open arms of the EPM, another representative behaviour of anxiety, but negatively correlated with it. In addition to anxiolysis, the present study also showed that the microinjection of MUSC and BACL agonists into rostral sites of the medial Acb shell (AP, +1.2 to +1.6) increased food intake significantly whereas drinking behaviour kept unchanged. Both doses of MUSC and BACL also decreased feeding latency. BACL but not MUSC dose-dependently increased food length. The data indicated a putative role of GABA receptors (especially GABAB) in the medial Acb shell for anxiety modulation in rats."
"Depression is the most common psychiatric complication in Parkinson's disease (PD). The pathophysiological events leading to PD-associated depression, however, remain largely unknown. The present study tested the differential implication of dopaminergic systems in depressive-like behavior in rats and its response to l-Dopa and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram. The learned helplessness model was used as a behavioral paradigm. Rats were lesioned in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and assigned to subgroups with respect to the stereologically verified extent of the nigral and/or VTA degeneration. Both lesions increased depressive-like behavior in rats, which was reduced by both citalopram and l-Dopa treatment. We conclude that dopaminergic lesions of either the SNc or the VTA contribute to the manifestation of depressive-like behavior in rats. The effects of citalopram administration on depressive behavior induced by lesions of dopaminergic brain regions furthermore suggest an involvement of serotonergic pathways in dopaminergic cell loss-induced depression."
"Sustained nociceptive behaviors (SNBs) are an important but under-studied component of chronic pain conditions. The group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist (R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) produces SNBs when injected intrathecally, and group I mGluR antagonists are effective at reducing symptoms of neuropathic and inflammatory pain. The present experiments examined whether rats with sciatic nerve injury or persistent inflammation exhibit greater SNBs following intrathecal DHPG compared with control animals. SNBs were observed following intrathecal injection of DHPG (25 nmol) between the L4 and L5 vertebrae. We used a behavioral observation scoring system that allowed for assessment of specific behaviors in the hind paws. When DHPG was injected intrathecally in rats with chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve, they showed increased paw stamping behavior compared to DHPG-injected sham controls. Rats treated with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammation failed to demonstrate a significant increase in paw stamping behavior. However, both CCI and CFA rats showed increased paw licking and biting of the neuropathic/inflamed hind paw after intrathecal DHPG injection. These results provide evidence for behaviorally relevant contributions of group I mGluRs to SNBs in models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain."
"Three experiments examined appetitive trace and delay conditioning of the licking response (LR). In Experiment 1, normal rats were trained in trace conditioning using different trace intervals (2, 4, or 8s) and in delay conditioning (i.e., with a 0-s trace) in order to determine an appropriate trace interval for the following lesion experiments. Only the rats trained with a 2-s trace interval ultimately reached the same level of learning as rats trained in delay conditioning. In Experiments 2A and 2B, the performance of rats with dorsal, ventral, and complete excitotoxic hippocampal lesions was compared to that of sham-operated rats in LR conditioning with a 2-s trace. In Experiment 2B, the performance of rats in trace LR conditioning was also compared to that of rats tested in the delay paradigm. In both experiments, acquisition did not differ in lesioned and sham-operated rats and, in Experiment 2B, it was faster in the delay than in the trace paradigm. These results contrast with those showing that aversive trace conditioning is impaired after hippocampal damage. Experiment 3 examined whether the differential effects of hippocampal lesions on aversive and appetitive trace conditioning could be related to a parametric difference, that is, the relative durations of the conditional stimulus and of the trace interval. Again, hippocampal damage failed to produce a learning impairment. It is suggested that the procedure of aversive, but not of appetitive, trace conditioning is context-specific and that an intact hippocampus is required only in these situations."
"Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inactivates dopamine in prefrontal cortex and is associated clinically with a schizophrenia endophenotype. Using an ethologically based approach, the phenotype of mice with heterozygous COMT deletion was characterised by decreased rearing with increased sifting and chewing. Heterozygous COMT deletion is associated with a distinctive phenotype. This differs from that which we have reported previously for heterozygous deletion of the schizophrenia risk gene neuregulin-1."
"Zebrafish has been a favourite of developmental biologists and numerous genetic tools have been developed for this species. In recent years, zebrafish has become an increasingly popular subject of neuroscientists and behavioural scientists. One of the typical characteristics of zebrafish is shoaling, individuals forming a tight group in which fish swim together. The biological mechanisms of social behaviours are complex and not well understood in vertebrates, and zebrafish, due to its highly social nature and the genetic tools developed for it, may represent an excellent animal model with which these mechanisms may be studied. Improvement of behavioural quantification methods would facilitate research in this area. We describe a custom software application that allows the precise quantification of several parameters of group cohesion in zebrafish. We also present three experimental examples to illuminate the use of our methodology, and show how group cohesion changes in response to manipulations of the environment."
"Stressor-provoked anxiety, plasma corticosterone, and variations of brain monoamine turnover are influenced by genetic factors, but may also be moderated by early life experiences. To evaluate the contribution of maternal influences, behavioral and neurochemical stress responses were assessed in strains of mice that were either stressor-reactive or -resilient (BALB/cByJ and C57BL/6ByJ, respectively) as well as in their reciprocal F(1) hybrids. BALB/cByJ mice demonstrated poorer maternal behaviors than did C57BL/6ByJ dams, irrespective of the pups being raised (inbred or F(1) hybrids). The BALB/cByJ mice appeared more anxious than C57BL/6ByJ mice, exhibiting greater reluctance to step-down from a platform and a greater startle response. Although the F(1) behavior generally resembled that of the C57BL/6ByJ parent strain, in the step-down test the influence of maternal factors were initially evident among the F(1) mice (particularly males) with a BALB/cByJ dam. However, over trials the C57BL/6ByJ-like behavior came to predominate. BALB/cByJ mice also exhibited greater plasma corticosterone elevations, 5-HT utilization in the central amygdala (CeA), and greater NE turnover in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). Interestingly, among the F(1)'s corticosterone and 5-HIAA in the CeA resembled that of the BALB/cByJ parent strain, whereas MHPG accumulation in the PVN was more like that of C57BL/6ByJ mice. It seems that, to some extent, maternal factors influenced anxiety responses in the hybrids, but did not influence the corticosterone or the monoamine variations. The inheritance profiles suggest that anxiety was unrelated to either the corticosterone or monoamine changes."
"Although environmental enrichment has been shown to improve various types of memory in young and aging mice, no study has directly compared the degree to which enrichment improves memory at different ages throughout the lifespan in male mice. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of long-term continuous enrichment in young (3 months), middle-aged (15 months), and aged (21 months) male C57BL/6 mice. Spatial reference memory was tested in the Morris water maze. Results demonstrate that 24h/day environmental enrichment for approximately 6 weeks significantly improved spatial memory in the Morris water maze in aged males, but not in young or middle-aged males. These data also indicate that 24h exposure to complex enriched housing conditions increases the magnitude of enrichment-induced improvements in memory among aged mice relative to those previously reported by this lab and others."
"The novel nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) system was proposed to be an important component of neural circuits involved in stress-coping behaviour and fear. This study investigated whether variations between the mouse strains in vulnerability to social crowding stress might be linked to different regulation of N/OFQ system transcripts in mice. Three weeks old C57BL/6J (B6), BALB/cByJ (CBy) and 129S2/SvPas (129S2) male mice were housed individually or in crowded (7/cage) conditions and then tested as adults in a battery of anxiety tests (open field, elevated plus-maze and acoustic startle reflex tests). Both 129S2 and B6 mice displayed increased signs of anxiety under crowded housing, while CBy mice tended to show the opposite profile. Analysis of gene expression revealed a 10-fold increase of nociceptin precursor and 4-fold increase of the NOP receptor mRNAs contents in the hippocampus of CBy mice kept in crowded conditions compared to those housed individually. In B6 mice, mRNA level of the peptide precursor remained unchanged, while that of the receptor was increased by 2-fold under crowding compared to individual housing. No significant changes were detected in 129S2 mice. These findings show that social housing may be important environmental stress factor in mice depending on the strain. The possible involvement of central nociceptin mechanisms in behavioural resilience to social crowding stress is discussed."
"Intervening with serotonergic neurotransmission can have profound effects on mobility. For instance, the peripheral administration of the 5-HT(2A/C) agonist, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), changes the locomotor activity substantially. Locomotor activity is classically linked to the basal ganglia, in which the subthalamic nucleus (STN) plays a pivotal role. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the STN modulates DOI-induced hypomobility. Rats were implanted with stimulating electrodes at the level of the STN and were tested in an open field (OF) task in various conditions (stimulation on/off, in combination with DOI treatment). We found that DOI administration (i.p.) reduced the behavioural activity of the animals and that STN HFS reversed these effects. This study provides the first evidence that the therapeutic effect of STN HFS may also be mediated by a 5-HT-dependent mechanism."
"Alarm calls are widely used in mammals. Their biological function is to deter predators and warn relatives of danger. Despite this important function of alarm calls, the development of alarm call recognition is poorly understood. Using laboratory rats, the present study investigated in a first experiment whether alarm calls are recognized innately. In experimentally naive animals, we found significantly increased freezing if stimuli in the 22 kHz range were presented but this response was not specific to conspecific 22 kHz calls. Therefore, a second experiment addressed the hypothesis whether recognition of conspecific 22 kHz calls can be learned and whether this learning is facilitated by a preparedness to acquire defensive responses to alarm calls. Our data show that rats learned quickly to associate the 22 kHz calls with aversive stimuli. Interestingly, the animals were more reluctant to extinguish this memory, and this information retained longer in memory than in the case of other types of calls and ultrasonic stimuli. We, therefore, conclude that rats are predisposed to acquire adaptive defensive behaviour in response to alarm calls. In particular, our data indicate that better encoding of such learning in rats leads to a stable memory which better resists extinction."
"Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle reflex (ASR) has been reported to be weaker in females than males for both humans and rats. Although there are exceptions, on balance these data suggest that PPI is sensitive to sex-specific neurosteroids; in contrast, most studies with mice have not replicated this effect. We compared PPI for noise decrement prepulses (quiet gaps) in female CBA/CaJ mice at 3-8 months (pre-menopausal: n = 55) and 17-25 months of age (post-menopausal, n = 33) with similarly aged groups of males (n = 48, 35). Both PPI and ASR levels were significantly reduced in pre-menopausal females compared to young males, but did not differ between post-menopausal females and old males. The observed PPI decrement in young female mice compared to young males agrees with one previous report in young C57BL/6J mice as well as the majority of studies with human subjects and some strains of rats. The absence of a sex difference in PPI for old mice is consistent with the hypothesis that PPI is affected by reproductive hormones present at high levels only in pre-menopausal females. We note that this effect size for PPI is small, perhaps consistent with reports that the PPI decrement in females is restricted to certain times within the menstrual cycle in women and the estrous cycle in rats. The negative findings previously reported in the mouse can be attributed to the small effect size and to procedural differences, including stimulus conditions, and the different strains and ages of mice."
"Navigation in real environments is often impaired by traumatic brain injury (TBI). These deficits in wayfinding appear to be due to disruption of cognitive processes underlying navigation and may in turn be due to damage to the hippocampus and frontal lobes. These wayfinding problems after TBI were investigated using a virtual simulation of a Morris Water Maze (MWM), a standard test of hippocampal function in laboratory animals. The virtual environment consisted of a large virtual arena in a very large virtual room whose walls provided views of a naturalistic landscape. Eleven community-dwelling TBI survivors and 12 comparison participants, matched for gender, age and education were tested to see if they could find a location in the arena marked by one of the following: (a) a visible platform, (b) a single proximal object, (c) a single proximal object among seven other distracter objects, or (d) distal features inside and outside the room. The proximal objects allowed participants to use egocentric (body-centered) navigational strategies that rely on relatively simple stimulus-response associations. The absence of proximal cues forced the participants to rely on distal features of the environment (room walls, landscape elements) and tested their ability to use allocentric (world-based) navigational strategies requiring cognitive mapping. Results indicated that the navigation of TBI survivors was not impaired when the proximal cues were present but was impaired when proximal cues were absent. These results provide more evidence that the navigational deficit after TBI is due to an inability to form, remember or use cognitive maps."
"Exposure to methamphetamine early in life can have lasting effects on cognitive processes. The maturation of neurotransmitter systems targeted by methamphetamine differs by gender during childhood and preadolescence, which could lead to differential long-term effects of early drug exposure. Therefore, the current study assessed whether preadolescent exposure to methamphetamine has gender specific long-term effects on adult spatial memory in rodents. Male and female rats were given 1 daily injection of 0 or 2mg/kg methamphetamine or not handled from PD21-35 and then tested as adults (PD95) in the Morris water maze. In general, male rats performed better than female rats in the water maze task regardless of treatment group. Female rats exposed to methamphetamine from PD21-35 had shorter latencies and took more direct paths to the hidden platform compared to control females during the 4 days of acquisition training and when the hidden platform was moved each day on matching to place trials. Male rats exposed to methamphetamine swam a shorter distance to the hidden platform on the first day of acquisition training, similar to the methamphetamine exposed females. However, the methamphetamine exposed males performed more poorly compared to control males in the matching to place trials. Overall, the current study found that methamphetamine exposure during preadolescence has long-term effects on spatial memory in a gender specific manner. These findings may contribute to our general understanding of the long-term effects of psychostimulant exposure at early developmental stages."
"Aim was to investigate differences in the central-nervous processing of gustatory stimuli between normogeusic subjects and patients with taste disorders. Twelve subjects with normal gustatory function and eight patients suffering from hypo- to ageusia underwent one fMRI run each in a 1.5 T scanner where they received liquid gustatory stimuli. fMRI analyses were performed by means of SPM2. Across all participants clusters of activated voxels were mainly found in orbitofrontal and insular regions of interest. Even those patients who did not perceive any stimuli showed some activation of gustatory centers. Group comparisons revealed higher activation of the insular and orbitofrontal cortices in patients compared to the group of healthy subjects. While further studies are needed, this finding may be interpreted in terms of enhanced neuronal recruitment due to functional impairment in patients with gustatory loss. It may ultimately prove useful in terms of the prognostic evaluation of individual patients."
"Sexual differentiation of the brain in rodents is achieved by estrogens, which are converted from androgens in the brain, during the perinatal period. We have identified the progranulin (PGRN) gene as one of the sex steroid-inducible genes that may be involved in masculinization of the rat brain. In the present study, we generated a line of mice with targeted disruption of the PGRN gene, and investigated male sexual behaviour, aggression and anxiety. PGRN-deficient mice exhibited a decrease in ejaculation incidence, while the latency and frequency of both mount and intromission were unchanged. For the aggressive behaviour test, the resident-intruder paradigm was used, and PGRN-deficient mice exhibited enhanced aggressiveness. In wild-type mice, males exhibited lower levels of anxiety than females by the open field test, while male PGRN-deficient mice exhibited an elevated level of anxiety and sex difference in anxiety was not observed. In addition, mRNA expression of the serotonergic receptor 5-HT1A, which could be related to the inhibition of aggression and anxiety, was significantly reduced in the hippocampus of PGRN-deficient mice after aggressive encounters. On the other hand, deficiency of the PGRN gene did not affect serum testosterone concentrations. These results suggest that PGRN gene plays a role in establishing sexual dimorphic behaviours at least partially by modulating the brain serotonergic system."
"When a discrete cue (a ""sign"") is presented repeatedly in anticipation of a food reward the cue can become imbued with incentive salience, leading some animals to approach and engage it, a phenomenon known as ""sign-tracking"" (the animals are sign-trackers; STs). In contrast, other animals do not approach the cue, but upon cue presentation go to the location where food will be delivered (the goal). These animals are known as goal-trackers (GTs). It has been hypothesized that individuals who attribute excessive incentive salience to reward-related cues may be especially vulnerable to develop compulsive behavioral disorders, including addiction. We were interested, therefore, in whether individual differences in the propensity to sign-track are associated with differences in responsivity to cocaine. Using an autoshaping procedure in which lever (conditioned stimulus) presentation was immediately followed by the response-independent delivery of a food pellet (unconditioned stimulus), rats were first characterized as STs or GTs and subsequently studied for the acute psychomotor response to cocaine and the propensity for cocaine-induced psychomotor sensitization. We found that GTs were more sensitive than STs to the acute locomotor activating effects of cocaine, but STs showed a greater propensity for psychomotor sensitization upon repeated treatment. These data suggest that individual differences in the tendency to attribute incentive salience to a discrete reward-related cue, and to approach and engage it, are associated with susceptibility to a form of cocaine-induced plasticity that may contribute to the development of addiction."
"The locomotor pattern, generated by the central pattern generator, is under the dependence of descending and peripheral pathways. The afferent feedback from peripheral receptors allows the animal to correct for disturbances that occur during walking, while supraspinal structures are important for locomotion in demanding situations such as ladder walking. Such walking, by regards to the control needed for accuracy of movements, is now widely used for description of consequences of nervous system dysfunction on motor performance. It is important to have a good knowledge of the changes in kinematic parameters according to walking conditions, since it might reflect different neural mechanisms. The aim of this work was to perform a 3D kinematic analysis of both hind- and forelimb during overground and ladder walking, to study qualitative and quantitative locomotor characteristics in different modes of locomotion. The analysis was performed on 5 rats. Movements of the right hind- and forelimb were evaluated using a 3D optical analyser, and EMG of the soleus and tibialis anterior muscles was synchronously recorded. Results indicate that kinematic and electromyographic characteristics of locomotion are dependent on the type of support. Changes were more obvious for hindlimb than for forelimb. Velocity, stride length and tibialis anterior burst duration were lower on ladder than on runway. In addition, during ladder walking, a protraction was noticed, rats bring their feet more rostral at the end of the swing phase. All these changes constitute an adaptive strategy to allow a better tactile activity with forelimbs and to avoid foot misplacement."
"Induction of the immediate early gene protein product Fos has been used extensively to assess neural activation in the striatum after repeated amphetamine administration to rats in their home cages. However, this technique has not been used to examine striatal activation after repeated administration outside the home cage, an environment where repeated drug administration produces more robust psychomotor sensitization. We determined the dose-response relationship for amphetamine-induced psychomotor activity and Fos expression in nucleus accumbens and caudate-putamen 1 week after repeated administration of amphetamine or saline in locomotor activity chambers. Repeated administration of amphetamine enhanced amphetamine-induced locomotor activity and stereotypy and Fos expression in nucleus accumbens, but not in caudate-putamen. In comparison, levels of Fos expression induced by 1mg/kg amphetamine were not altered in nucleus accumbens or caudate-putamen by repeated amphetamine administration in the home cage. Double-labeling of Fos protein and enkephalin mRNA indicates that Fos is expressed in approximately equal numbers of enkephalin-negative and enkephalin-positive neurons in nucleus accumbens and caudate-putamen following injections outside the home cage. Furthermore, repeated amphetamine administration increased drug-induced Fos expression in enkephalin-positive, but not enkephalin-negative, neurons in nucleus accumbens. We conclude that repeated amphetamine administration outside the home cage recruits the activation of enkephalin-containing nucleus accumbens neurons during sensitized amphetamine-induced psychomotor activity."
"Magnetic resonance images were collected in 76 chimpanzees and the sylvian fissure was examined for the presence of a posterior bifurcation. A bilateral bifurcation of the sylvian fissure into an ascending and descending ramus was identified in 58 of the subjects. The posterior ascending ramus was measured in both hemispheres in order to evaluate the presence, magnitude, and direction of a planum parietale asymmetry. Statistical analysis revealed a main effect for sex. Specifically, females showed a significant rightward bias, whereas males did not. Moreover, an examination of posterior bifurcation patterns of the sylvian fissure revealed differences between the left and right hemispheres. In humans, subject handedness and sex have been found to have an effect on planum parietale asymmetry. To determine if this was also the case in our chimpanzee subjects, we evaluated whether or not planum parietale asymmetry was related to subject handedness. Although subject handedness was not directly related to planum parietale asymmetry quotients, whether or not the sylvian fissure bifurcated bilaterally at its posterior end was influenced by the handedness of the subjects. These results support the view that asymmetries in the perisylvian language areas were present in the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees."
"Damage to the perirhinal cortex (PRh) in rats impairs anterograde object-recognition memory after retention intervals of up to several hours, but there is little direct evidence to link PRh function to object-recognition abilities after substantially longer intervals that span several days or weeks. We assessed the effects of PRh lesions on anterograde object recognition using a novel-object preference test, with retention intervals lasting 24 h and 3 weeks. The rats received multiple exposures to the sample object during the learning phase--5 min per day on 5 consecutive days. Control rats displayed a significant novel-object preference after both retention intervals, indicating recognition of the sample object, whereas the rats with PRh lesions displayed a significant preference after the 24-h interval, but not after the 3-week interval. When the learning phase of the trial was shortened to a single 5-min session, the PRh group was impaired in the 24-h condition. The findings indicate that the disruptive effects of PRh damage on anterograde object recognition persist over very long postlearning intervals. The results indicate further that object recognition impairments following PRh damage are not ubiquitous, and that learning conditions play a significant role in determining the subsequent recognition performance in rats with PRh damage."
"It has been recently shown that Roman high- (RHA) and low- (RLA) avoidance rats show behavioural divergence in successive negative contrast (SNC) induced in one-way avoidance learning [Torres C, C&#xe1;ndido A, Escarabajal MD, de la Torre L, Maldonado A, Tobe&#xf1;a A, et al. Successive negative contrast effect in one-way avoidance learning in female roman rats. Physiol Behav 2005;85:377-82]. A 2-experiment study was conducted with the goal of analyzing whether these differences in SNC can also be extended to a different experimental paradigm. Food-deprived RHA and RLA female rats were exposed to a straight alley, recording the latency (DV) between leaving the start box and reaching the food available in the goal box at the end of the alley. To induce the SNC effect the amount of reinforcement received went from 12 pellets in the pre-shift phase to 1 pellet (Experiment 1) or 2 pellets (Experiment 2) in the postshift phase. The SNC effect appeared in both strains in Experiment 1, but only in RLA rats in Experiment 2. These results are discussed within the framework of SNC theories that account for this effect by using emotional mechanisms, as related to the differences in emotional reactivity seen between the RHA and RLA strains in a number of behavioural tests of fear/anxiety."
"In this study, we investigated the effects of early postnatal sibling deprivation (EPSD) on spatial learning and memory in adult rats. Litters were culled to one pup with its mother on postnatal day (PN) 1 or 7 and their spatial learning and memory ability were examined with Morris water maze in adult. EPSD on PN1 improved, but on PN7 impaired performance of the spatial learning task in adult female rats. However, EPSD did not have any effect on the spatial learning ability in adult male rats."
"Previous research has shown that the ability to orient with the use of directional cues from the geomagnetic field is lateralized in three avian species: orientation is possible when the birds are restricted to use of their right eye, but not when they have to use their left eye. This has been interpreted as possible lateralization of the perception mechanisms for magnetic cues in favour of the right eye. Recent discovery of magnetic compass orientation in domestic chicks, a species in which lateralization has been well studied, has made available a model system in which to explore these lateralized processes more fully. Hence we tested chicks monocularly in the same test conditions as used previously to demonstrate the chick's use of a magnetic compass. In a magnetic field with North shifted by 90 degrees , chicks using their right eye oriented according to magnetic cues, whereas chicks using the left eye did not, but continued to prefer the original direction. Analysis of the times taken to respond indicated longer latencies in the chicks using their left eye, suggesting a possible conflict between cues. The different behaviour of the chicks using their left eye might not be a matter of a right eye-left hemisphere specialization for detecting magnetic directions, but of hemispheric specialization for attending to specific types of cues."
"Recent evidence indicates that the hippocampus contributes to the control of defensive behaviors in rodents. Here, electrical stimulation (1s, 60 Hz) of the rat dorsal hippocampus inhibited defense in the elevated plus maze (increased open arm exploration) and shock-probe burying test (reduced burying duration), while ventral hippocampal stimulation had no effects. Thus, the dorsal hippocampus may play an important role in modulating a range of defensive strategies."
"Human anxiety and vestibular disorders have long been known to co-occur. Paralleling human clinical and non-clinical data, mounting genetic, pharmacological and behavioral evidence confirms that animal anxiety interplays and co-exists with vestibular/balance deficits. However, relatively few animal models have addressed the nature of this relationship. This paper examines side-by-side human psychiatric and otovestibular phenotypes with animal experimentation data, and outlines future directions of translational research in this field. Discussed here are recently developed specific animal models targeting this interplay, other traditional animal tests sensitive to altered anxiety and vestibular domains, and the existing problems with translation of animal data into human phenotypes. The role of hearing deficits and their contribution to anxiety and vestibular phenotypes are also outlined. Overall, the overlap between anxiety and balance disorders emerges as an important phenomenon in both animal and clinical studies, and may contribute markedly to the complexity of behavioral and physiological phenotypes. Animal experimental models that focus on the interplay between anxiety and vestibular disorders are needed to improve our understanding of this important biomedical problem."
"Compounds enhancing N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor function have been reported to improve cognitive deficits. Since cognitive deficits are considered to be the core symptom of schizophrenia, enhancing NMDA receptor function represents a promising approach to treating schizophrenia. In the present study, we investigated whether d-serine or a glycine transporter inhibitor N-[3-(4'-fluorophenyl)-3-(4'-phenylphenoxy)propyl]sarcosine (NFPS), both of which enhance NMDA receptor function, could improve MK-801-induced cognitive deficits in rats, and compared their effects with those of the atypical antipsychotic clozapine and of the typical antipsychotic haloperidol. To assess cognitive function, we used a novel object recognition test in rats that measured spontaneous exploratory activity of a novel object when paired with a familiar object. We then evaluated the effects of the compounds on cognitive deficits induced by treatment with MK-801, the NMDA receptor antagonist. Pretreatment with clozapine (1, 5 mg/kg, i.p.) but not haloperidol (0.03, 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly improved MK-801-induced cognitive deficits. Pretreatment with D-serine at 800 mg/kg (i.p.) or NFPS (0.3, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly improved MK-801-induced cognitive deficits under this test paradigm. These findings suggest that impaired preference for novel objects induced by MK-801 in the novel object recognition test could be a useful animal model for evaluating the efficacy of compounds targeting the cognitive deficits observed in schizophrenic patients. The results also suggest that enhancing NMDA receptor function is an effective way for treating the cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia."
"Neurochemical studies have shown that mesocortical dopamine projections are particularly responsive in aversive situations such as fear conditioning. The present study assessed behavioural and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) dopamine responses utilizing in vivo microdialysis during acquisition and expression of a conditioned fear response. In two independent experiments, rats were presented with either two or nine tone-shock pairings during formation of a conditioned fear response. In the second experiment, rats were pre-treated with repeated injections of either amphetamine or saline over a 6-day period and tested during withdrawal. Amphetamine pre-treatment as well as the conditioning procedure itself potentiated an increase in dopamine levels during formation, but not expression of a conditioned fear response. Locomotor activity induced by an amphetamine challenge (1mg/kg) was also enhanced in pre-treated amphetamine compared to saline pre-treated animals (experiment two). However, mPFC dopamine response to amphetamine challenge did not differ between treatment groups. We conclude that while the exact role of mPFC dopamine in behavioural sensitization is yet to be determined, mPFC dopamine release may underlie the increased fear response during acquisition but not expression of fear response."
"Recent neurophysiological studies have begun to uncover the neuronal correlates of eye hand coordination. This study was designed to test whether the frontal eye field (FEF) saccadic activity is modulated by hand position. Single neurons were recorded in two macaque monkeys performing visually guided saccades while holding their hand at given locations on a touchscreen. To determine the relative contributions of hand vision and its proprioception, monkeys executed the task with or without vision of the hand. We found that saccadic activity of more than half of the neuronal sample (54%; n=130) was dependent on hand position relative to the saccade end point. Both visual and proprioceptive signals contributed to this modulation. These data demonstrate that the oculomotor function of the FEF takes into account hand position in space."
"The zebrafish has been an excellent model organism of developmental biology and genetics. Studying its behavior will add to the already strong knowledge of its biology and will strengthen the use of this species in behavior genetics and neuroscience. Anxiety is one of the most problematic human psychiatric conditions. Arguably, it arises as a result of abnormally exaggerated natural fear responses. The zebrafish may be an appropriate model to investigate the biology of fear and anxiety. Fear responses are expressed by animals when exposed to predators, and these responses can be learned or innate. Here we investigated whether zebrafish respond differentially to a natural predator or other fish species upon their first exposure to these fish. Na&#xef;ve zebrafish were shown four species of fish chosen based on predatory status (predatory or harmless) and geographical origin (allopatric or sympatric). Our results suggest that na&#xef;ve zebrafish respond differentially to the stimulus fish. Particularly interesting is the antipredatory response elicited by the zebrafish's sympatric predator, the Indian Leaf Fish, and the fact that this latter species exhibited almost no predatory attacks. The findings obtained open a new avenue of research into what zebrafish perceive as ""dangerous"" or fear inducing. They will also allow us to develop fear and anxiety related behavioral test methods with which the contribution of genes to, or the effects of novel anxiolytic substances on these behaviors may be analyzed."
"It is well known that early life events induce long-lasting psychophysiological and psychobiological influences in later life. In rodent studies, environmental enrichment after weaning prevents the adulthood behavioral and emotional disturbances in response to early adversities. We compared the behavioral effect of neonatal isolation (NI) with the effect of NI accompanied by tactile stimulation (NTS) to determine whether NTS could reverse or prevent the effects of NI on the adulthood behavioral and emotional responses to environmental stimuli. In addition, we also examined the sex difference of the NTS effect. Measurements of body weights, an open-field locomotor test, an elevated plus maze test, a hot-plate test, and a contextual fear-conditioning test were performed on postnatal day 60. As compared with rats subjected to NI, rats subjected to NTS showed significantly higher activity and exploration in the open-field locomotor test, lower anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze test, and significantly prolonged latencies in the hot-plate test, and this effect was equal among males and females. In the contextual fear-conditioning test, whereas NTS significantly reduced the enhanced freezing time due to NI in females, no significant difference in the freezing time between NI and NTS was found in males. These findings indicate that adequate tactile stimulation in early life plays an important role in the prevention of disturbances in the behavioral and emotional responses to environmental stimuli in adulthood induced by early adverse experiences."
"Tourette syndrome (TS) is a heterogenous neuropsychiatric disorder. In most cases, tics are self-limited or can be treated by behavioral or pharmacological therapy. However, for some individuals, tics can cause lifelong impairment and life-threatening symptoms, which are intractable to traditional treatment. Neural stem cell (NSC) is a potential tool to treat certain neurological diseases. In this study, we proposed to use neural stem cell transplantation as a novel therapy to treat TS and discussed its efficacy. Wistar rats were microinfused with TS sera into the striatum followed by the transplantation of NSCs or vehicle at the infusion site. The sera of the TS patients were identified to have enriched antineural antibodies. Prior to grafting, rat embryonic NSCs were co-cultured with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (Brdu) for 24 h. Stereotypic behaviors were counted at 1, 7, 14 and 21 days after transplantation of NSCs. Morphological analyses revealed that NSCs survived and differentiated into neurons and astrocytes in the striatum 3 weeks after grafting. To sum it up, rat embryonic neural stem cell grafts survived and differentiated in the striatum of TS rat may help relieve stereotypic behaviors of the host. Our results suggest that transplantation of NSCs intrastriatum may have therapeutic potential for TS."
"Although the process of extinction has been well documented for various forms of behavioral responses, the effects of extinction on the reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior are relatively understudied. In this report, the effectiveness of an extinction training protocol to reduce primed reinstatement responses was compared with the effectiveness of an equivalent period of enforced abstinence. We found that extinction training performed in the drug taking environment significantly reduced reinstatement behavior subsequently primed by either contextual cues, conditioned cues, or cocaine infusion. The ability of extinction to reduce cocaine primed reinstatement was blocked by the systemic administration of the competitive NMDAR antagonist ((+/-)CPP, 5mg/kg i.p.) administered prior to each extinction training session. Interestingly, this pharmacological intervention had no impact on the effectiveness of extinction to reduce drug-seeking behavior primed by either contextual cues or conditioned cues. These results suggest that an extinction training experience involves multiple mechanisms that can be dissociated into nonNMDAR and NMDAR dependent components with respect to the type of reinstatement (i.e. context-, conditioned stimuli (CS)-, or drug-induced) being assessed."
"It was suggested that phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors may be potential neuroleptic drugs with a low risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. In the study presented, we compared the effects of the neuroleptics, haloperidol, and risperidone and the PDE10A inhibitor papaverine as well as the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram on retrieval of conditioned avoidance responding in the pole-jumping task and on locomotor activity. After acute administration, the substances used reduced locomotor activity dose-dependently. Both PDE inhibitors interfered with conditioned avoidance responding, suggesting neuroleptic-like effects. Risperidone showed a favourable profile of action. In all the doses tested, no signs of unspecific impairments in the performance of the instrumental task occurred. The profile of rolipram was similar. In the doses tested, only minor impairments in the performance of the instrumental task were found. Rolipram showed a similar effect to risperidone, suggesting therapeutic usefulness as an atypical neuroleptic. However, the use of this substance is limited by its emetic effects in therapeutically relevant doses."
"Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its role in cognition has been relatively little studied. APP knockout (KO) animals have been described previously and show deficits in grip strength, reduced locomotor activity and impaired learning and memory in a conditioned avoidance test and the Morris water-maze. In order to further investigate the in vivo function of APP and its proteolytic derivatives, we tested APP KO mice and age-matched wild type controls at two different ages, 3 and 8 months, in a range of behavioural tests measuring neuromuscular, locomotor and cognitive functions. These tests included the acquisition of a passive avoidance response as a measure of long-term memory of an aversive experience, and spontaneous alternation in a Y-maze, regarded as a measure of spatial short-term memory. The absence of APP expression in APP KO mice was confirmed at the protein level using hippocampal tissue in Western blotting. APP KO mice displayed deficits in forelimb grip strength and locomotor activity in agreement with previous studies. In the Y-maze test used for spontaneous alternation behaviour, APP KO animals did not exhibit reduced alternation rates. On the other hand, in the passive avoidance test, APP KO mice showed an age-related deficit in retention of memory for an aversive experience. The results suggest that APP and/or its proteolytic derivatives may play a role in long-term memory in adult brain and/or may be required during the development and maintenance of neuronal networks involved in this type of memory."
"Methotrexate (MTX) is a cytostatic agent widely used in combination with other agents as adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and is associated with cognitive impairment as a long-term side effect in some cancer patients. This paper aimed to identify a neurobiological mechanism possibly responsible for this cognitive impairment using an animal model. The first study explored the hypothesis that MTX reduces neuronal cell proliferation. A dose-dependent long-lasting decrease in hippocampal cell proliferation was shown with Ki-67 immunocytochemistry, following a single intravenous injection of MTX (37.5-300 mg/kg). Animals treated with MTX also showed a dose-dependent transient decrease in body weight gain. In the second study, the effect of MTX (250 mg/kg) on two spatial learning tasks was examined. Animals treated with MTX learned the Morris water maze task adequately; however, these animals showed a longer latency time to cross the platform location in the probe trial, reflecting an impairment of spatial memory function. In the novel object recognition task, animals treated with MTX failed to distinguish a novel object from a familiar one, indicating a decrease in the comparator function of the hippocampus. Our studies indicated that, in the rat, MTX has a dose-dependent negative effect on hippocampal cell proliferation, and on cognitive behavior. These findings suggest that adverse effects of certain cytotoxic agents on hippocampal cell proliferation may have a potential contributory role in cognitive impairment observed in humans after chemotherapy."
"alpha-Mannosidosis is a lysosomal storage disorder resulting from a functional deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-mannosidase. This deficiency results in the accumulation of various oligosaccharides in the lysosomes of affected individuals, causing somatic pathology and progressive neurological degeneration that results in cognitive deficits, ataxia, and other neurological symptoms. We have a naturally occurring guinea pig model of this disease which exhibits a deficiency of lysosomal alpha-mannosidase and has a similar clinical presentation to human alpha-mannosidosis. Various tests were developed in the present study to characterise and quantitate the loss of neurological function in alpha-mannosidosis guinea pigs and to follow closely the progression of the disease. General neurological examinations showed progressive differences in alpha-mannosidosis animals from approximately 1 month of age. Significant differences were observed in hind limb gait width from 2 months of age and significant cognitive (memory and learning) deficits were observed from 3 months of age. Evoked response tests showed an increase in somatosensory P1 peak latency in alpha-mannosidosis guinea pigs from approximately 2 months of age, as well as progressive hearing loss using auditory brainstem evoked responses. The alpha-mannosidosis guinea pig therefore appears to exhibit many of the characteristics of the human disease, and will be useful in evaluating therapies for treatment of central nervous system pathology."
"Anxiety is an important modulator of social behavior across species and parallel defects in anxiety and social interaction are frequently observed in mental illnesses such as autism and schizophrenia. The mouse is a powerful model organism to study the molecular genetic basis of these behaviors. Here we analyzed the relationship between social behavior and innate anxiety in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice using a mating-related interaction (MRI) test in which a resident male was observed during exposure to a sexually receptive female. Unlike male-male encounters where social interaction is brief and tentative and aggressive behaviors are prominent, male-female encounters are characterized by a strong motivation for extensive social interaction with the potential for modulation by innate anxiety. We hypothesized that differences in innate avoidance behavior between mouse-inbred strains would contribute to mating-related social interaction strategies. Our observations showed that C57BL/6 and BALB/c males exhibited distinct approach strategies in the mating-related interaction test that correlated with specific features of anxiety as observed in the open field. These findings suggest that mating-related social approach behavior shares similar genetic determinants with non-social approach-avoidance behaviors."
"Increased glutamatergic activity is believed to play a significant role in the development of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID). LID may therefore be attenuated by a reduction in glutamatergic function. This was tested pharmacologically in MPTP monkeys by increasing the formation of kynurenic acid (KYNA), a tryptophan metabolite that inhibits glutamate release and also blocks NMDA receptors directly. KYNA synthesis was stimulated by prolonged systemic administration of the kynurenine 3-hydroxylase inhibitor Ro 61-8048. Four MPTP cynomolgus monkeys received l-dopa (LD; 100mg) with benserazide (25 mg) for one month. Progressively, all these animals developed LID. Four other MPTP monkeys received Ro 61-8048 (50mg/kg) daily 3 h before administration of LD/benserazide for one month. The addition of Ro 61-8048 reduced the development of LID but did not affect the antiparkinsonian efficacy of LD. Moreover, Ro 61-8048 administration caused sustained increases in serum kynurenine and KYNA concentrations, which reverted to basal values 24 h after the last treatment. This effect of Ro 61-8048 was less pronounced in the CSF. These results demonstrate that long-lasting elevation of KYNA levels caused by prolonged inhibition of kynurenine 3-hydroxylase is associated with a significant reduction in LID but does not compromise the benefits of chronic LD therapy."
"We investigated the effects of anisomycin (ANI) treatment (150 mg/kg s.c.) during late stages of memory consolidation in a juvenile recognition task in mice. ANI treatment blocked 24 h recognition memory if administered 9 h, 12 h or 15 h after learning. As shown by a significantly reduced incorporation of radioactively labelled amino acids into newly synthesized proteins, translational arrest by ANI treatment lasted for 3-4 h, thus covering the complete time period between 9 h and 18 h after memory acquisition. Together with previous findings [Richter K, Wolf G, Engelmann M. Social recognition memory requires two stages of protein synthesis in mice. Learn Mem 2005;12(4):407-13], our data suggest two distinct stages of protein synthesis to occur during the first 24 h after learning: an early, relatively short-stage, starting immediately after learning and lasting for approximately 3h, and a second stage starting 6 h after learning lasting for approximately 12 h. This is the first report of such a long-lasting protein synthesis-dependent second consolidation phase in mice and suggests that long-term consolidation of juvenile recognition memory comprises multiple waves of protein synthesis and complex cascades of inter- and intra-cellular signaling processes."
"Systemically administered human recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) may have the potential to reduce the cognitive and behavioural symptoms of a mechanical brain injury. In a series of studies we address this possibility. We have previously found that EPO given to fimbria-fornix transected rats at the moment of injury is able substantially to improve the posttraumatic acquisition of allocentric place learning tasks administered in a water maze as well as in an 8-arm radial maze. It is, however, essential to evaluate this clinically important ability of EPO within other cognitive domains, as well. Consequently, we presently studied the effects of similarly administered EPO in fimbria-fornix transected and control operated rats, respectively--evaluating the posttraumatic behavioural/cognitive abilities in a spatial delayed alternation task performed in a T-maze. Administration of EPO to the hippocampally injured rats was associated with a substantial reduction of the lesion-associated behavioural impairment--while such an impairment was clearly seen in the saline injected fimbria-fornix transected group. In contrast, EPO had no detectable effect on the task acquisition of non-lesioned animals. The results of the present study confirm our previous demonstrations that EPO is able to reduce or eliminate the behavioural/cognitive consequences of mechanical injury to the hippocampus--and emphasize that this ability is present across a broader spectrum of cognitive domains."
"D-amphetamine (AMP) paired with physical activity (e.g., beam walking) improves recovery after ischemic injury to the cortical motor system of rodents. We tested whether AMP promotes recovery after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in rats. A moderate-sized ICH was produced by stereotaxically injecting collagenase into the striatum. Five days later rats were placed into either environmental enrichment cages (EE) or a control condition (group housing in standard cages) until euthanasia at 4 weeks post-ICH. Animals were injected with either AMP (2 mg/kg i.p.) or sterile saline on days 7, 9 and 11 after ICH. Rats in EE also received training on beam (walking) and tray (skilled reaching) tasks 30 min after each injection. Walking (beam and ladder task), skilled reaching (tray and staircase tasks) and neurological deficits (NDS) were repeatedly assessed. We predicted that EE would improve recovery and that AMP would further enhance it. Results showed that EE, but not AMP, significantly and consistently improved recovery on the beam and ladder task. Neither treatment significantly affected skilled reaching. Lesion volume was not significantly different among groups (overall average: 44.6 mm(3) of tissue lost +/-15.3 S.D.). In conclusion, EE provides modest benefit for striatal ICH whereas AMP does not. This suggests that AMP will not provide substantial benefit to those patients with severe ICH affecting the basal ganglia."
"Alcohol-induced zinc (Zn) deficiency is one of the mechanisms proposed as a cause of ethanol teratogenicity. Subcutaneous Zn treatment with ethanol in early pregnancy has been shown to prevent birth abnormalities and memory impairments in mice. This study examined whether dietary Zn supplementation throughout pregnancy can prevent cognitive impairments caused by early ethanol exposure. Pregnant C57BL/6J mice were fed either a control (35 microg Zn/g) or Zn-supplemented (200 microg Zn/g) diet throughout pregnancy. On gestational day (GD) 8, mice received two intraperitoneal injections (4h apart) of either saline or 25% ethanol (0.015 mL/g). All offspring were screened for physical and behavioural defects (e.g. growth, visual, exploratory, anxiety, motor deficits). Twenty-four phenotypically-normal offspring were randomly selected from each of the four treatment groups (saline +/- Zn-supplementation, ethanol +/- Zn-supplementation) and tested at 60 d of age using a cross-maze escape task for spatial learning and memory impairments, and an object recognition task. While no differences were observed between treatments for spatial learning, offspring exposed to ethanol demonstrated spatial memory impairments at both 12 and 28 d after learning an escape task, with less correct trials and increased escape latency scores compared with saline-treated mice. Furthermore, these mice also exhibited impairments in object recognition memory. In comparison, ethanol-exposed offspring from dams fed a Zn-supplemented diet throughout pregnancy did not display spatial memory or object recognition deficits, performing at the same level as saline-treated offspring. Therefore, dietary Zn-supplementation during pregnancy prevents spatial and object recognition memory impairments caused by ethanol exposure during early pregnancy."
"We have previously shown that lurasidone, a novel atypical antipsychotic, potently reverses learning impairment induced by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist MK-801 in the rat passive avoidance test. However, the effects of lurasidone in other learning and memory tasks remain to be investigated. We investigated the effects of lurasidone and other marketed antipsychotics (risperidone, clozapine, aripiprazole, and haloperidol) on MK-801-induced impairment of learning and memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) and radial-arm maze (RAM) tests in rats. Learning and memory impairment in the MWM test, as measured by escape latency, escape distance, and diving behavior, and in the RAM test, as measured by reference and working memory errors, was induced by MK-801 (i.p.) at doses of 0.15 and 0.2 mg/kg, respectively. In the MWM test, lurasidone (1 and 3 mg/kg p.o.) potently reversed MK-801-induced learning impairment. In the RAM test, lurasidone (1 and 3 mg/kg p.o.) potently reversed MK-801-induced reference memory impairment and moderately but not significantly attenuated MK-801-induced working memory impairment. Risperidone (0.3 and 1mg/kg p.o.), clozapine (3 and 10 mg/kg p.o.), aripiprazole (0.3 and 1mg/kg p.o.), and haloperidol (0.3 and 1mg/kg p.o.) did not reverse MK-801-induced impairment of learning and memory in both tasks. Lurasidone, but not the other antipsychotics tested in this study, reverses MK-801-induced impairment of learning and memory in both the MWM test and the RAM test. These results suggest that lurasidone would be more effective in treating schizophrenics with cognitive dysfunction than current antipsychotics."
"The purpose of the current study was to relate basal corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) mRNA level in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) with anxiety-like behavior using three strains of rat reported to exhibit a range of behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to stress. Anxiety-like behavior was determined for Fischer (F344), Wistar, and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats with an elevated plus-maze and CRF mRNA level was measured using in situ hybridization. WKY rats exhibited more anxiety-like behavior on the elevated plus-maze than both F344 (p's &lt; 0.01) and Wistar rats (p's &lt; 0.05). WKY rats had higher basal levels of CRF mRNA in the CeA than F344 rats (p &lt; 0.05) with a trend toward higher levels than Wistar rats (p = 0.06). Wistar rats had similar indices of anxiety with F344 rats and comparable levels of CRF mRNA in the CeA. Basal plasma corticosterone was similar for all three strains and repeated experience with the plus-maze had no effect on basal corticosterone levels or CRF mRNA levels in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) for Wistar or WKY rats. Consistent with reported hyperactivity of the hypothalamopituitary adrenal axis of F344 rats with repeated stress, we observed elevated corticosterone following repeated exposure to the elevated plus-maze in F344 rats (p &lt; 0.01) with a trend toward increased CRF mRNA levels in the PVN (p = 0.09). Heightened expression of CRF in the CeA of WKY rats may be involved in anxiety-like behaviors observed in this strain."
"Evidence in several species, including dogs, has been collected demonstrating that the brain hemispheres modulate the immune system in an asymmetrical way. To study the interactions between immune response and lateralization, three groups of mixed breed dogs were selected on the basis of their performance in a paw preference test involving removal of a piece of sticky tape from the snout. The expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) genes was measured in left-pawed, right-pawed and ambidextrous dogs before and after immunization treatment with a rabies vaccine. The results revealed a relationship between the mRNA expression of IL-2 and IL-6 genes and the direction of behavioural lateralization. Under basal conditions, IL-2 and IL-6 gene expression was higher in left-pawed dogs than in right-pawed and ambidextrous dogs. After the vaccine administration, decreasing levels of IL-2 and IL-6 gene expression were observed in left-pawed and right-pawed dogs, but not in ambidextrous dogs. These findings represent the first evidence that brain lateralization may influence the immune system in dogs by the modulation of mRNA gene expression of cytokines such as IL-2 and IL-6, which have been recognized as key immune-regulatory proteins."
Stress and anxiety play a role in many psychological processes including social behavior. The present study examines the effects of urocortin II (UCN II) on spontaneous parental behavior in adult prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). UCN II was found to increase passive parental behavior in voles while not affecting any stress-related measures. Delineating the mechanism of this change will aid in our understanding of the regulation of parenting.
"The present study was designed to assess the participation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in the display of estrous behavior induced by application of vaginal-cervical stimulation (VCS) and by the intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of progesterone and its ring A-reduced metabolites to ovariectomized (ovx), estradiol benzoate (E2B) primed rats. Icv injection of Antide, a GnRH-1 receptor antagonist, significantly depressed lordosis behavior in ovx, E2B-primed rats treated with icv GnRH. Application of VCS to ovx, E2B-primed rats facilitated both lordosis and proceptivity. These behavioral responses were significantly depressed by the icv administration of Antide. Similarly, icv Antide blocked the stimulatory effect on both lordosis and proceptive behaviors elicited by progesterone and its ring A-reduced metabolites: 5alpha-pregnandione (5alpha-DHP), 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one (5alpha,3alpha-Pgl) and 5beta-pregnan-3beta-hydroxy-20-one (5beta,3beta-Pgl) in ovx, E2B-primed rats. By contrast, icv injection of Antide failed to interfere with the facilitatory effect of the synthetic progestin megestrol acetate on lordosis and proceptive behaviors. This progestin is not reduced in ring A. The results suggest that GnRH release is an important process in the chain of events leading to the display of estrous behavior in response to progesterone, its ring A-reduced metabolites, and VCS in female rats."
"Rho family GTPases have been implicated as important regulators of neuronal development. Rac3 is a member of this family specifically expressed in vertebrate developing neurons, where it is coexpressed with the ubiquitous Rac1 GTPase. We have previously shown that Rac3 knockout mice are viable and fertile. The Rac3 protein shows highest expression around postnatal day 7 in brain regions relevant for cognitive behaviors. In this study we find that Rac3 knockout mice do not show defects in spatial reference memory assessed with water maze task, but they show a reduced behavioral flexibility to novel situations. Analysis of explorative behavior revealed hyperactive behavior and hyperreactivity to the presentation of new stimuli, as assessed by dark/light box, emergence and novel object tests. These defects were not due to reduced visual abilities, since visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were comparable in Rac3 knockout and wildtype littermates. Our data reinforce the notion that Rho family GTPases are important for normal cognitive development, and highlight specific functions of Rac3 that cannot be compensated by the coexpressed homologous Rac1."
"Clinical studies show cognitive impairment in depression. However, the neural substrates underlying these remain elusive. Hence, we have examined the effect of neonatal clomipramine treatment on cognition in adulthood. The neonatal clomipramine treated rats displayed a profound impairment in partially baited 8-arm radial maze task. This work provides a novel perspective into neural basis of depression associated cognitive changes and help in development of therapeutic strategies to treat depression related memory dysfunctions."
"The present experiment used electrolytic lesions in combination with curve-shift scaling to study the functional relation between the habenula and four different brain sites that support operant responding for brain stimulation reward. Rats were implanted with a monopolar stimulation electrode aimed at the lateral hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, dorsal raphe or median raphe nuclei, and a lesioning electrode in the ipsilateral habenula. Operant nose poking resulted in self-administration of trains of electrical pulses to one of the above stimulation sites. Reward thresholds were derived from response-number curves and defined as the pulse number necessary for half-maximal responding. Rats were tested daily at each of three current intensities that were chosen from individual number-current trade-off functions and that yielded baseline reward thresholds of approximately 10, 20 and 40 pulses/train. Testing resumed 24h after lesioning the habenula (100 muA anodal current, 20-25s) and continued for 3-4 weeks. A total of 19 rats completed the experiment. In five of these, habenular lesions clearly reduced the rewarding effectiveness of the stimulation; reward thresholds increased by approximately 30-245% (0.12-0.54 log10 units). Generally, lesion effects were observed at low and medium current intensities, developed gradually and did not recover. Histological analysis revealed that in two rats the stimulation electrode was located in the posterior lateral hypothalamus, two in the anterior ventral tegmental area and one in the area of the dorsal raphe. These results strongly suggest that the habenula constitutes an important component of the neural circuitry important for brain stimulation reward."
"The independent effects of ovarian and adrenal hormones on spatial place learning were examined in male and female Long-Evans hooded rats. Experimental groups received bilateral ovariectomy (females only) and adrenalectomy (both sexes), followed by hormone administration according to a predetermined schedule. Spatial and reversal training in the Morris water maze were used to measure behavioural performance in locating a hidden platform. General proficiency and strategies use were assessed using search times and time spent in the periphery, respectively. The number of direct and circle swims to the platform was used to assess memory for the location of the hidden platform. Experiment 1 investigated the roles of estradiol and progesterone in spatial navigation in the absence of high levels of adrenal steroids. The female group that received estradiol alone showed longer search times, greater periphery swimming, and fewer direct and circle swims to the target than all other female groups. Experiment 2 investigated the role of corticosterone (CORT) in spatial navigation in the absence of ovarian hormones. Male and female rats that received acute matched doses of exogenous CORT were equally impaired during spatial training. During reversal training, the impairment in search time, periphery swimming, and direct and circle swims persisted in the female CORT group only. Analysis of serum CORT levels in the male and female experimental groups revealed no significant differences. These data suggest that estradiol and CORT can independently impair acquisition of spatial navigation skills and strategies use in adult female rats."
"Following one or more chemotherapy treatments, many patients report that they experience anticipatory nausea. This phase of nausea has been interpreted as a classically conditioned response where a conditional association develops between the contextual clinic cues and the nausea and/or vomiting that developed following treatment. Although rats do not vomit, they display a distinctive gaping reaction when exposed a flavored solution previously paired with a toxin. Here we report that, even in the absence of a flavored solution, rats display conditioned gaping reactions during exposure to a distinctive context previously paired with a high dose of lithium (Experiment 1 with a distinctive odor and Experiment 3 without a distinctive odor), a low dose of lithium (Experiment 2) or provocative vestibular stimulation (Experiment 2). These results suggest that the conditioned gaping reaction in rats is selectively elicited by nausea-paired contextual stimuli, as well as flavors. This rat model of anticipatory nausea may serve as a valuable preclinical tool to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-nausea treatments and the side effect of nausea produced by newly developed pharmaceutical compounds intended for other clinical treatments."
"Chronic stress impairs spatial memory and alters hippocampal structure, which are changed in the opposite direction following enriched environment (EE). Therefore, this study incorporated these two paradigms to determine whether EE would prevent chronic stress from impairing spatial learning and memory. Young adult male rats were housed in EE for 1 week prior to and throughout 3 weeks of daily restraint stress. On the day after the end of restraint, rats were trained and tested on either a water maze (19 degrees C or 24 degrees C water temperature) or a spatial recognition Y-maze (4-h and 1-min delay between training and testing). Chronically stressed rats housed in standard conditions showed impaired acquisition on the 19 degrees C version of the water maze and deficits on the 4-h delay version of the Y-maze. Chronically stressed rats housed in EE, however, showed intact performance on all tasks. All rats showed intact performance on the 24 degrees C version of the water maze and on water maze probe trials for both versions. The results showed that EE in adulthood prevented spatial learning and memory impairment in chronically stressed rats, indicating that the context of stress exposure impacts susceptibility to chronic stress-induced cognitive deficits."
"Enkephalin-deficient knockout mice, a genetic model of enhanced anxiety responses, and wild-type controls were housed in two separate facilities on the same campus using different caging systems. Stress reactivity was evaluated in these animals using a zero-maze test followed by c-Fos expression analysis in limbic brain regions. Animals with genetically or pharmacologically enhanced anxiety reared and tested in the same facility displayed similar behavioral reactivity and c-Fos induction. However, we found much stronger anxiety-related behavioral responses and higher c-Fos levels when animals were house in individually ventilated cages, independent of their genetic background."
"The onset of parental behavior has profound and enduring effects on behavior and neurobiology across a variety of species. In some cases, mere exposure to a foster neonate (and a subsequent parental response) can have similar effects. In the present experiment, we exposed adult male and female prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) to two foster pups for 20 min and quantified cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (DG), medial amygdala (MeA) and cortical amygdala (CorA). Prairie voles are highly social rodents that typically display biparental care and spontaneous parental care when exposed to foster pups. Comparisons were made between the animals that responded parentally or non-parentally towards the pups, as well as control conditions. Cell proliferation was assessed using injections of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and immunocytochemical localization of this marker. The phenotype of the cells was determined using double label immunofluoresence for BrdU and TuJ1 (a neuronal marker). An increase in cell proliferation in the DG was seen in animals exposed to pups. However, animals that responded non-parentally had a greater number of BrdU labeled cells in the DG compared to those that responded parentally. The majority of BrdU labeled cells co-expressed TuJ1 across all groups. These results demonstrate that exposure to a foster pup and the behavioral reaction to it (parental or non-parental) are associated with site-specific changes in cell proliferation."
"To investigate genotype x environment interactions in the forced swim test, we tested the influence of water temperature (20 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 30 degrees C) on floating behaviour in single-housed male C57BL/6J and BALB/c mice. We observed a contrasting relationship between floating and water temperature between the two strains, with C57BL/6J floating more and BALB/c floating less with increasing water temperature, independent of the lightening conditions and the time point of testing during the animals' circadian rhythm. Both strains showed an inverse relationship between plasma corticosterone concentration and water temperature, indicating that the differences in stress coping are unrelated to different perception of the aversive encounter. Treatment with desipramine (20mg/kg, i.p.) caused a reduction in immobility time in C57BL/6J mice if the animals were tested at 30 degrees C water temperature, with no effect at 25 degrees C and no effects on forced swim stress-induced corticosterone secretion. The same treatment failed to affect floating behaviour in BALB/c at any temperature, but caused a decrease in plasma corticosterone levels. Taken together we demonstrate that an increase in water temperature in the forced swim test exerts opposite effects on floating behaviour in C57BL/6J and BALB/c and renders single-housed C57BL/6J mice, but not BALB/c mice, susceptible to antidepressant-like behavioral effects of desipramine."
"It is widely acknowledged that the indoleamine neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) plays a dual role in the regulation of anxiety, a role that in part depends upon neuroanatomical locus of action. Thus, whereas stimulation of 5-HT 1A or 5-HT2 receptors in the limbic forebrain (amygdala, hippocampus) enhances anxiety-like responding in rodents, activation of corresponding receptor populations in the midbrain periaqueductal grey (PAG) more often than not reduce anxiety-like behaviour. The present study specifically concerns the anxiety-modulating influence of 5-HT2 receptors within the mouse PAG. Experiment 1 assessed the effects of intra-PAG infusions of the 5-HT2B/2C receptor agonist mCPP (0, 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 nmol/0.1 microl) on the behaviour of mice exposed to the elevated plus-maze. As mCPP acts preferentially at 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors, Experiment 2 investigated its effects in animals pretreated with ketanserin, a preferential 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist. In both cases, test sessions were videotaped and subsequently, scored for anxiety-like behaviour (e.g., percentage of open arm entries and percentage of open arm time) as well as general locomotor activity (closed arm entries). The results of Experiment 1 showed that mCPP microinfusions (0.03 and 0.1 nmol) into the PAG of mice decreased behavioural indices of anxiety without significantly altering general activity measures. In Experiment 2, the anxiolytic-like profile of intra-PAG mCPP (0.03 nmol) was substantially attenuated by intra-PAG pretreatment with an intrinsically inactive dose of the preferential 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist, ketanserin (10 nmol/0.1mul). Together, these data suggest that 5HT2C receptor populations within the midbrain PAG play an inhibitory role in plus-maze anxiety in mice."
"17beta-Estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) influence the onset and duration of sexual behavior and are also associated with changes in behaviors that may contribute to mating, such as exploration, anxiety, and social behaviors (socio-sexual behaviors). In the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA), the P4 metabolite, 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP), modulates lordosis of E2-primed rodents; 3alpha,5alpha-THP can also influence anxiety and social behaviors. To examine if 3alpha,5alpha-THP in the VTA mediates socio-sexual behaviors, we infused 3alpha,5alpha-THP to the VTA of diestrous and proestrous rats. As expected, proestrous, compared to diestrous, rats showed more exploratory (open field), anxiolytic (elevated plus maze), pro-social (partner preference, social interaction), and sexual (paced mating) behavior and had increased E2, P4, dihydroprogesterone (DHP), and 3alpha,5alpha-THP in serum, midbrain, hippocampus, diencephalon, and cortex. Infusions of 3alpha,5alpha-THP to the VTA, but not control sites, such as the substantia nigra (SN) or central grey (CG), of diestrous rats produced behavioral and endocrine effects akin to that of proestrous rats and increased DHP and 3alpha,5alpha-THP levels in midbrain, hippocampus, and diencephalon. Levels of DHP and 3alpha,5alpha-THP, but neither E2 nor P4 concentrations, in midbrain, hippocampus, diencephalon, and/or cortex were positively correlated with socio-sexual behaviors. Thus, 3alpha,5alpha-THP infusions to the VTA, but not SN or CG, can enhance socio-sexual behaviors and increase levels in midbrain, hippocampus, and diencephalon."
"Deficiency of the meso-diencephalic dopamine (mdDA) neuron specific transcription factor Pitx3 in aphakia (ak) mice results in the loss of the substantia nigra compacta (SNc). Concomitantly, reduced spontaneous locomotor behavior, symptoms reminiscent to those in Parkinson's disease, has been reported. However, the ak mouse line originates from the 1960s and has been compared to C57BL/6J inbred controls. Therefore, to define Pitx3 gene function in baseline and novelty-induced locomotor behavior and mdDA neuronal activity, we analyzed Pitx3-deficiency in a controlled genetic and epigenetic background. The analysis implicated that, in contrast to the controversial and previously reported hypo-activity in ak mice, Pitx3-/- mice showed normal dark phase motor activity levels. Our data also revealed that ak and Pitx3-/- mice both display a similar neuro-anatomical and physiological phenotype, and, interestingly, showed increased spontaneous home cage activity levels during their habitual sleep phase. Further behavioral analysis revealed that both ak and Pitx3-/- mice have reduced transitions but increased consolidation of specific locomotor behaviors, such as rearing and horizontal movement. Thus, Pitx3 is not involved in the expression of nighttime motor activity levels, but is critical for selective mdDA neuronal activity and associated with increased consolidation of movement."
"Many psychological disorders are characterized by anxiety and alterations in social interactions. Recent studies demonstrate that the chemical messenger nitric oxide (NO) can regulate both anxiety and social behaviours. We tested whether an enzyme that produces NO in the brain, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), serves as an interface between social interactions and anxiety-like behaviour. Several investigators have observed that mice increase anxiety-like responses in the elevated plus-maze after pair housing. nNOS gene deletion and 3-Bromo-7-Nitroindazole were used to inhibit the production of neuronal NO. Similar to previous studies, pair housing reduced open arm exploration in the elevated plus-maze. Pair housing also increased corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) immunoreactive cells in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Inhibition of NO production increased open arm exploration in pair-housed mice but decreased open arm exploration in individually housed mice. These results suggest that the effect of nNOS inhibition on anxiety-like responses is context dependent and that behavioural responses to social housing are altered after nNOS inhibition. This research suggests that NO may play an important role in mediating the effect social interactions have on anxiety."
"Studies investigating response reversal consistently implicate regions of medial and lateral prefrontal cortex when reinforcement contingencies change. However, it is unclear from these studies how these regions give rise to the individual components of response reversal, such as reinforcement value encoding, response inhibition, and response change. Here we report a novel instrumental learning task designed to determine whether regions implicated in processing reversal errors are uniquely involved in this process, or whether they play a more general role in representing response competition, reinforcement value, or punishment value in the absence of demands for response change. In line with previous findings, reversal errors activated orbitofrontal cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, caudate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These regions also showed increased activity to errors in the absence of contingency changes. In addition, ventrolateral PFC, caudate, and dorsolateral PFC each exhibited increased activity following correct reversals. Activity in these regions was not significantly modulated by changes in reinforcement value that were not sufficient to make an alternative response advantageous. These data do not support punishment-processing or prepotent response inhibition accounts of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex function. Instead, they support recent conceptualizations of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex function that implicate this region in resolving response competition by manipulating the representation of either motor response options, or object features. These data also suggest that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex plays a role in reversal learning, probably through top down attentional control of object or reinforcement features when task demands increase."
"The cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, which project to cortex, the thalamic reticular nucleus and the amygdala, are implicated in many aspects of attentional function, while the intrinsic neurons of the basal forebrain are implicated in learning and memory. This study compared the effects of lesions of the basal forebrain made with either the immunotoxin 192-IgG-saporin (which selectively destroys cholinergic neurons), or the non-selective excitotoxin, ibotenic acid (which destroys both cholinergic and non-cholinergic neurons) on a task which measure the acquisition and shifting of attentional set as well as the ability to learn reversals of specific stimulus-reward pairings. Rats learned to obtain food reward by digging in small bowls containing distinctive digging media that were differentially scented with distinct odours. They performed a series of two-choice discriminations, with the bait associated with either the odour or the digging medium. Rats with 192-IgG-saporin lesions of the basal forebrain were not impaired relative to control rats at any stage of the task. Rats with ibotenic acid lesions of the basal forebrain were impaired the first time stimulus-reward contingencies were reversed. They were not impaired in acquisition of new discriminations, even when an attentional-shift was required. These data are consistent with data from marmosets and so highlight the functional similarity of monkey and rodent basal forebrain. They also confirm the likely involvement of non-cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain in reversal learning."
"NAC1 is a novel member of the POZ/BTB (Pox virus and Zinc finger/Bric-a-bracTramtrack Broad complex) but varies from other proteins of this class in that it lacks the characteristic DNA-binding motif, suggesting a novel role. We have employed constitutive gene deletion to elucidate the role of NAC1 in vivo. Nac1 mutant mice are viable with no obvious developmental or physiological impairments. Previous studies suggest a role for NAC1 in cocaine-mediated behaviors. Therefore, we evaluated a variety of behaviors associated with psychomotor stimulant effects in Nac1 mutant mice. Acute locomotor activating effects of cocaine or amphetamine are absent in Nac1 mutant mice, however longer exposure to these psychomotor stimulants result in the development of behavioral sensitization. Acute rewarding properties of cocaine and amphetamine are also blunted in mutant mice, yet repeated exposure resulted in conditioned place preference similar to that observed in wild-type mice. Lastly, increases in extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, which accompany acute cocaine administration, are blunted in mutant mice, but following chronic cocaine extracellular dopamine levels are increased to the same extent as in wild-type mice. Together these data indicate involvement of NAC1 in the acute behavioral and neurochemical responses to psychomotor stimulants."
"Rat pups subjected to a single 24h maternal deprivation show altered stress responsiveness and cognitive performance in the water maze in adulthood. Here we show in 6-month-old male CD1 mice (deprived 24h at postnatal day 8) an initial impairment in reversal learning: relocating the platform revealed perseverance in search for the former location. Spatial learning, long-term memory and swim-induced corticosterone responses were not affected. We conclude that reduced flexibility is a subtle long-lasting behavioural change induced by maternal deprivation."
"When making decisions, the outcomes of different choices play an important role. Feedback is mainly processed in terms of gains and losses. It is as yet unclear whether this distinction holds for predictable as well as unpredictable outcomes. Using ERPs, the present study aimed to determine whether predictable and unpredictable outcomes are coded differently in the brain. Participants had to choose between one of two options: the certain option was always associated with a gain of 10 euro, while the uncertain option entailed a gain of 30 euro or a loss of 10 euro, with a probability of 50% each. Overall, subjects showed a clear preference for the certain option, a tendency which became more pronounced during the course of the experiment. An early ERP component, the P200, reflected the predictability of outcomes, which was critical for the subsequent decisions. The later feedback related negativity (FRN) reflected the known distinction between gains and losses, while the N500 again reflected differential processing of predictable and unpredictable outcomes. Neither FRN nor the N500 were significantly related to behaviour. Predictability appears to play a central role in outcome evaluation."
"The purpose of the present study was to examine whether short-term food restriction (40% less food over a 3-month period) can attenuate ischemia-induced CA1 neuronal degeneration, and whether this attenuation translated into improved recovery of functional impairments following global ischemia. There was a significant loss of pyramidal CA1 neurons in ischemic compared to sham-operated rats but no difference between the ad lib and food-restricted ischemic animals. Although the diet did not influence neuronal damage in ischemic animals, the performance of food-restricted ischemic rats in spatial task such as the radial arm maze was significantly better than that of ad lib fed ischemic rats. Food-restricted ischemic rats made equivalent numbers of working memory errors as sham-operated animals and took the same time to complete a standard 8-arm radial arm maze task. They also displayed higher activity level in the open field compared to ad libitum fed ischemic rats, and spent considerably more time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze compared to the other groups, suggesting decreased anxiety in these ischemic rats. The relative sparing of spatial memory performance in food-restricted ischemic animals suggests that food restriction facilitates functional recovery."
"We previously demonstrated that hormone treatments which stimulate female-directed singing increased levels and turnover of dopamine (DA) in brain areas controlling the motor patterning of song. To help determine how DA affects singing, we quantified the effects of treating adult male finches with the D1/D2 receptor antagonist cis-flupenthixol. Adult males were given subcutaneous silastic implants of androgen, in case drug treatment interfered with androgen secretion. One week later, they were tested with females. Males were divided into three groups matched for levels of courtship singing. Males were then subcutaneously implanted with osmotic minipumps containing either saline, a low, or a high dose of cis-flupenthixol. Each male was tested with a different female 5 and 10 days after implantation to determine how this D1/D2 receptor antagonist affected behavior. Both drug doses affected female-directed singing 5 days after initiation of treatment. High-dose males sang to females significantly less often than males in the other two groups. Low-dose males showed fewer high-intensity courtship displays in which males dance towards females as they sing. These effects on courtship singing were not seen at day 10, though other behavioral effects were seen at this time. Male beak wipes, rocks, following females and female withdrawals from males were also affected by drug treatment. General activity in the home cage was decreased by day 11. These data demonstrate that singing and several other female-directed behaviors are sensitive to perturbations in DA receptor function."
"Achievements made over the last years have highlighted the important role of creatine in health and disease. However, studies of its effect on cognition function have been limited. In the present study, we investigated the effect of creatine on early consolidation of the spatial learning in rats. Statistical analysis showed that intrahippocampal administration of creatine (2.5 and 7.5 nmol/hippocampus) (post-training) decreased the latency for scape and mean number of errors in Barnes maze test. The involvement of polyamine binding site at NMDA receptor in creatine-induced spatial learning enhancement was investigated by co-administration of arcaine (0.02 nmol/hippocampus) or spermidine (0.02 nmol/hippocampus) with creatine (2.5 nmol/hippocampus) (post-training). Statistical analysis revealed that creatine-induced spatial learning enhancement was reverted by co-administration of arcaine (0.02 nmol/hippocampus) and intensified by spermidine (0.02 nmol/hippocampus). These results provide evidence that creatine not only seem to be involved in energy metabolism but may also play an important role in early consolidation of spatial learning in hippocampus which participation of polyamines binding site at the NMDA receptor."
"Using a rat model of adolescent social stress (SS, daily 1 h isolation and change of cage partner, 30-45 days of age), we have reported sex-specific effects on neuroendocrine function over the course of SS, and enduring effects of SS in females, and not males, on drug-related behaviour. Here, we investigated both the immediate and enduring impact of SS in adolescence on anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and determined the temporal pattern of corticosterone release after confinement to the open arm of the EPM. When tested as adolescents, SS decreased anxiety-like behaviour in females and had no effect in males. When tested as adults several weeks after the chronic stress, overall, SS tended to increase anxiety-like behaviour in both sexes. However, estrous cycle moderated the effect in females, in that reduced anxiety-like behaviour was observed for SS females in the estrous group. Confinement to the open arm of the EPM increased plasma corticosterone concentrations, which declined markedly upon return to home cage for all except adolescent control males for which corticosterone concentrations at 45 and 90 min were elevated compared other groups. Among controls, anxiety-like behaviour decreased in females and increased in males with age, and confinement to the open arm of the EPM led to a greater increase in corticosterone concentrations in adult males compared to adolescent males. In sum, modest effects of adolescent social stress were observable several weeks after the stress exposure, indicating that sex-specific developmental trajectories and vulnerability to anxiety may be shaped by experiences in adolescence."
"Activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is presumably related to the degree of novelty and considered to reflect emotional reactivity. Exposure to novel environments can allow us to simultaneously evaluate both behavior and HPA activation and therefore it is an appropriate design to directly study the relationship between both responses. In the present experiment, we studied how previous exposure to a severe stressor (2 h of immobilisation, IMO, 5 days before testing) and repeated exposure to the same novel environment (a holeboard, HB) altered behavioral and HPA response to the HB. Previous exposure to IMO did not alter any behavior during the first exposure to the HB (5 min), but elicited a greater ACTH response as compared to stress-naive rats. However, corticosterone response did not differ between groups, probably because maximum corticosterone levels are never reached before 15-20 min. Repeated exposure of IMO and stress-naive rats to the HB every other day resulted in progressively lower levels of activity/exploration in both groups, whereas the ACTH and corticosterone responses were basically maintained intact over the days. The present results demonstrate a double dissociation between behavior and HPA activation in the HB. First, a single exposure to IMO elicited a long-lasting sensitisation of the HPA axis that apparently was not a direct consequence of fear/anxiety elicited by the novel environment. Second, progressive familiarisation of the animals with a novel environment resulting in apparently lower levels of motivation to explore did not appear to reduce the stressful properties of the situation as evaluated by ACTH release."
"This study aimed to investigate the relationship between substance P (SP) and diazepam (DZP) in the modulation of anxiety and memory in rats as evaluated in the elevated T-maze (ETM). For this purpose, in the first experiment, rats were intraperitoneally (i.p.) pretreated with saline or DZP (1mg/kg) and 25min later they were intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) injected with PBS or SP (10 pmol). In the second experiment, rats were i.p. pretreated with saline or DZP (1mg/kg) and 25 min later were i.c.v. injected with FK888 (100 pmol, a NK1 antagonist). After 1 min, animals were i.c.v. injected with vehicle (PBS+ethanol 10%) or SP (10 pmol). Our results show that DZP significantly decreased the latency to leave the enclosed arm of the ETM in the test and re-test session, indicating an anxiolytic and an amnesic effect, respectively. Although the central administration of SP did not significantly alter 'per se' the latency to leave the enclosed arm of the ETM in the test and re-test sessions, there was a trend to increase this parameter in the test session (indicating an anxiogenic-like effect). Furthermore, SP was able to reverse, via NK1 receptors, the effect produced by DZP during the test session. Moreover, none of the treatments interfered in the one-way escape behavior recorded in the test or re-test session in the ETM. In conclusion, our results strengthen and extend previous experimental data showing an interaction between the tachykinergic and benzodiazepine-GABA systems in the modulation of anxiety."
"The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) has been studied extensively as a purported rodent model of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Because ADHD in humans is partially defined by marked impulsivity, SHRs, if a valid model of ADHD, ought to behave more impulsively than their normotensive parent strain, Wistar Kyoto (WKY). This prediction was evaluated in two experiments that employed an intertemporal choice procedure in which SHRs and WKYs made repeated choices between a single food pellet delivered immediately and three food pellets delivered after a delay. Four or five delays were investigated (1, 3, 6, 12 and 24s); the experiments differed in the manner in which the delays were experienced. In Experiment 1, the delay values changed after each session and were presented in ascending then descending order. SHRs chose more small/immediate reinforcers than WKYs at the longest delays during the ascending series and at nearly all delays during the descending series. In Experiment 2, the delay values remained in effect for several sessions and were presented in random order. Again, the SHRs chose more small/immediate reinforcers than the WKYs at the longest delays. Thus, in the present study, the SHRs were shown to be more impulsive than the WKYs as defined by preference for smaller, immediate reinforcers over larger, delayed ones in an intertemporal choice procedure."
"A novel, appetitive, Pavlovian conditioning task was used to assess interval timing. Experiment 1 showed that normal rats could discriminate between tones of 1.5s and 0.5s duration, or between tones of 12.0 s and 3.0 s duration. Learning was demonstrated by a greater duration of magazine responding in the period before the delivery of a food reward and after cessation of the CS+ compared to the same time period after cessation of the CS-. Learning was, however, asymmetric as it was much quicker when the CS+ was the longer of the two durations (1.5s and 12.0 s, respectively). Experiment 2 assessed the impact of fornix lesions on the acquisition of one version of this task (CS+ 1.5s, CS- 0.5s). No evidence was found of a change in discrimination learning following surgery. Experiment 3 examined whether rats with either fornix or hippocampal lesions affected discriminations between 12.0 s and 3.0 s stimuli. Again, there was no evidence of a lesion-induced deficit. T-maze alternation training confirmed the effectiveness of these lesions. The results not only reveal that neither the fornix nor the hippocampus is necessary for distinguishing temporal intervals within the ranges tested but also showed how under some circumstances these lesions can leave trace conditioning intact."
"Previous studies found that complex social environment increases new neuronal recruitment in brains of adult male zebra finches, in comparison with exposure to a simple social environment. These experiments could not determine, however, whether this increase was due to greater amounts of auditory input (amount of auditory information the male is exposed to), or auditory output (amount of song it produces). To answer this question, we raised male zebra finches to adulthood in a controlled environment, and were then exposed them to either a single unfamiliar female (simple social environment) or to 45 unfamiliar zebra finches of both sexes (complex social environment). Their singing behavior was monitored in these new social environments. Birds which were exposed to a simple social environment sang significantly more than birds which were exposed to a complex social environment. This supports the hypothesis that increased neuronal recruitment in birds exposed to a complex social environment correlates with processing and storing of auditory input, and not with song produced by the bird."
"Sensitization to the effect of stress has been hypothesized as a mechanism to explain episode recurrence and cycle acceleration in bipolar disorder. Naturalistic observations and experimental work in human patients suggested that sleep deprivation can trigger manic episodes of illness. In rats sleep deprivation (SD) with the platform method caused mania-like behaviours thus providing an animal model of mania with face, construct, and predictive validity. In the present study we administered SD or control stress to male CD1 mice following a dose-response protocol based on time of exposure to the experimental conditions (6, 12 or 24 h) and repetition of treatment (three times). SD, but not stress-control conditions, increased motor activity and aggressive behaviours. The behavioural activation followed a dose-response curve based on length of treatment, with non-significant trends after 6h, significant effects after 12 h, and maximal effects after 24 h. Moreover, the behavioural activation followed a time-response curve, with progressive sensitization to the effects of SD, but not of control stress, upon its repetition. This is the first animal model of behavioural sensitization to the effects of a specific stress (sleep deprivation) known to trigger mania in bipolar patients. We expect it to be useful to test the efficacy of antimanic and mood-stabilizer drugs, and to study the neurobiological correlates of manic reactions in order to gain new insight into the pathophysiology of bipolar illness and to identify new targets for treatment."
"Although exercise has been known to regulate brain plasticity, its impact on psychostimulant reward and the associated mesolimbic dopamine system remained scarcely explored. A psychostimulant, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), is currently a worldwide abused drug of choice. We decided to examine the modulating effects of long-term, compulsive treadmill exercise on the hedonic value of MDMA in male C57BL/6J mice. MDMA-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) was used as a behavioral paradigm to indicate the reward efficacy of MDMA. We observed that sedentary control mice all demonstrated reliable MDMA-induced CPP with our conditioning protocol. Interestingly, pre-exposure to a treadmill exercise decreased the later MDMA-induced CPP in a running period-dependent manner. Specifically, mice undergoing a 12-week treadmill running exercise did not exhibit any approaching bias toward the MDMA-associated compartment in this CPP paradigm. Twelve weeks of treadmill running did not alter peripheral metabolism of MDMA 30min following single intraperitoneal injection of MDMA (3mg/kg). We further used microdialysis technique to study the underlying mechanisms for the impaired MDMA reward produced by the12-week exercise pre-exposure. We found that acute MDMA-stimulated dopamine release in nucleus accumbens was abolished in the exercised mice, whereas an obvious elevation of accumbal dopamine release was observed in sedentary control mice. Finally, the 12-week exercise program did not alter the protein levels of primary dopamine receptors, vesicular or membrane transporters in this area. We conclude that the long-term, compulsive exercise is effective in curbing the reward efficacy of MDMA possibly via its direct effect on reversing the MDMA-stimulated dopamine release in nucleus accumbens."
"Ts65Dn mice, like individuals with Down syndrome (DS), demonstrate a functional dissociation between explicit and implicit forms of memory, showing selective impairment in explicit or declarative learning tasks. Here, we explored Ts65Dn explicit memory deficits further by evaluating the ability of these mice to assimilate the temporal and spatial contexts under which previously novel objects had been encountered. We found that Ts65Dn mice could in fact form contextual representations of objects over the course of a few hours, contrary to their inability to discriminate object novelty over a more prolonged period of 24h. These results suggest that Ts65Dn mice might have particular difficulties in declarative tasks requiring long-term memory, presenting an especially important putative therapeutic target for pre-clinical and clinical DS research."
Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting the striatum and associated with deficits in voluntary movement in early stages. The final portion of aiming movements is particularly affected in HD and one hypothesis is that this deficit is linked to attention or terminal control requirements. Sixteen patients with early HD and 16 age-matched controls were examined in aiming movements. Four conditions manipulated movement termination requirements (discrete movements with a complete stop vs. cyclical back-and-forth movements) and the presence of flankers around the target. Reducing movement termination requirements significantly attenuated deficits in the final movement phase in patients. The presence of flankers around the target affected the initial portion of movements but did not affect the two groups differentially. These results indicate that terminal control requirements affect voluntary movements in HD. This suggests that frontostriatal systems are involved in movement termination.
"The effects of a single intraperitoneal administration of lithium, a drug used to prevent the recurrence of mania in bipolar disorders, were determined in the rat by studying changes in: (i) the wake-sleep cycle; (ii) autonomic parameters (hypothalamic and tail temperature, heart rate); (iii) the capacity to accumulate cAMP and IP(3) in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamic region (PO-AH) and in the cerebral cortex (CC) under an hypoxic stimulation at normal laboratory and at low ambient temperature (T(a)). In the immediate hours following the injection, lithium induced: (i) a significant reduction in REM sleep; (ii) a non-significant reduction in the delta power density of the EEG in NREM sleep; (iii) a significant decrease in the concentration of cAMP in PO-AH at normal laboratory T(a); (iv) a significant increase of IP(3) concentration in CC following exposure to low T(a). The earliest and most sensitive effects of lithium appear to be those concerning sleep. These changes are concomitant with biochemical effects that, in spite of a systemic administration of the substance, may be differentiated according to the second messenger involved, the brain region and the ambient condition."
"Neglect is a complex human cognitive spatial disorder typically induced by damage to prefrontal or posterior parietal association cortices. Behavioral treatments for neglect rarely generalize outside of the therapeutic context or across tasks within the same therapeutic context. Recovery, when it occurs, is spontaneous over the course of weeks to months, but often it is incomplete. A number of studies have indicated that anti-Nogo-A antibodies can be used to enhance plasticity and behavioral recovery following damage to motor cortex, and spinal cord. In the present studies the anti-Nogo-A antibodies IN-1, 7B12, or 11C7 were applied intraventricularly to adult rats demonstrating severe neglect produced by unilateral medial agranular cortex lesions in rats. The three separate anti-Nogo-A antibody groups were treated immediately following the medial agranular cortex lesions. Each of the three antibodies induced dramatic significant behavioral recovery from neglect relative to controls. Severing the corpus callosum to destroy inputs from the contralesional hemisphere resulted in reinstatement of severe neglect, pointing to a possible role of interhemispheric mechanisms in behavioral recovery from neglect."
"The hippocampal formation plays an essential role in associative learning like passive avoidance (PA) learning. It has been shown; orexin-containing terminals and orexin receptors densely are distributed in the hippocampal formation. We have previously demonstrated that antagonization of orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) in CA1 region of hippocampus and dentate gyrus (DG) impaired spatial memory processing. Although, there are few studies concerning function of orexinergic system on memory processing in PA task, but there is no study about physiological function of OX1R on this process. To address this, the OX1R antagonist, SB-334867-A, was injected into DG or CA1 regions of hippocampus and evaluated the influence of OX1R antagonization on acquisition, consolidation and retrieval in PA task. Our results show that, SB-334867-A administration into CA1 region impaired memory retrieval but not PA acquisition and consolidation. However, SB-334867-A administration into DG region impaired acquisition and consolidation but not PA memory retrieval. Therefore, it seems that endogenous orexins play an important role in learning and memory in the rat through OX1Rs."
"This study investigated if sub-populations of rats characterized by their basal level of impulsivity (BLI) in a delayed-reinforcement task, displayed differences in the functioning of neurotransmitter systems modulating impulsive choice behavior. For this, the effects of various doses of caffeine and d-amphetamine were investigated in three sub-populations of rats displaying pronounced differences in their impulsive choice behavior and their post-mortem serotonergic and dopaminergic functions were assessed. Caffeine and d-amphetamine reduce impulsive choice behavior only in the Medium BLI sub-population. Dopamine utilization was similar in the three sub-populations, but serotonin utilization was lower in the prefrontal cortex of the Medium and Very high BLI sub-populations as compared to the low BLI one. These results suggest that anti-impulsive effects of caffeine and d-amphetamine are dependent on the BLI of rats and that a low serotonergic function in the prefrontal cortex may be a trait marker of impulsivity evaluated by impulsive choice behavior."
"Environmental enrichment reduces reactivity to stressor and could also modulate pain perception. In this study we sought to compare the effects of enriched and standard housing on temperature perception. In an operant assay, rats housed in an enriched environment exhibited significantly lower sensitivities to thermal stimuli and displayed less exploratory behavior in a rearing chamber. These findings indicate that environmental enrichment can significantly affect temperature perception, likely through stress-related mechanisms."
"Cannabinoid receptors and their endogenous ligands (endocannabinoids) have been implicated in cocaine and amphetamine reward. Their role in psychostimulant-induced behavioural sensitization still has to be determined. The purpose of the present study was, for one, to compare the effects of a pharmacological and genetic manipulation of CB(1) cannabinoid receptors on amphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization in mice, and, secondly, to quantify the concentration of anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol in different forebrain areas of behaviourally sensitized animals. The results can be summarized as follows: CB(1) knockout mice failed to sensitize to the locomotor stimulant effects of amphetamine. On the contrary, administration of the CB(1) receptor antagonist SR141716A (rimonabant; 3mg/kg; i.p.) increased amphetamine sensitization in wild-type animals, indicating that the difference between CB(1) knockouts and SR141716A treated animals could be due to the 'chronic' versus 'acute' loss of CB(1) receptor function, or, alternatively, that SR141716A could exert pharmacological effects beyond its proposed CB(1) antagonistic action. Furthermore, sensitized wild-type mice and animals, which had received a single amphetamine injection on the challenge day, both had increased anandamide concentrations in the dorsal striatum and decreased anandamide levels in the ventral striatum, comprising nucleus accumbens. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol levels were decreased in the ventral striatum of sensitized animals only. Together, these findings suggest that prolonged activation of dopamine receptors could alter endocannabinoid levels and support the proposed involvement of the CB(1) receptor in amphetamine sensitization."
"Functional cerebral asymmetries (FCAs) are a fundamental principle of brain organization in many species. However, little is known about why they have evolved. Since FCAs are such a widespread phenomenon they seem to constitute an evolutionary selective advantage. According to a prominent hypothesis, an asymmetric brain should be associated with advantages in parallel processing, i.e. doing two tasks simultaneously. The strong version of this hypothesis implies that lateralized, instantaneous and complementary tasks are performed more efficiently with a highly lateralized brain. Using a visual half-field procedure, we wanted to test this strong version of the parallel-processing hypothesis in humans. Thirty-two participants (17 women, 15 men) were investigated. First, we assessed the degree of lateralization in a face/non-face and a word/non-word discrimination task favouring the right and left hemisphere, respectively. Based on a median split, subjects were divided into a rather symmetric and a rather asymmetric group. Then, all participants completed both tasks simultaneously. The results revealed that the rather symmetrically organized participants outperformed asymmetric participants in accuracy and response times. Hence, the strong version of the parallel-processing hypothesis has to be revised."
"Fifty percent of CD-1 mice from both sex die by the end of 2 years. The survival rate is higher in females than in males. This high mortality rate is associated to the high susceptibility of this strain of mice to some immuno-pathologies and the high incidence of systemic amyloidosis. It is therefore possible that premature cognitive deficits can be observed in CD-1 mice. In the present study, we describe a novel method for assessing emotional responses and memory performance of young (4 months) and middle-aged (12 months) CD-1 mice of both sexes in a 3D spatial navigation task. Animals are introduced to the maze without preliminary habituation and trained in a working memory test. As expected CD-1 mice have a low number of entries to arms on their first exposure to the maze which confirm our previous report on the anxious trait of this strain compared to C57/BL6 mice. The measure of arm/bridge ratio suggests that anxiety induced by exposure to the maze persists much longer in middle-aged male mice compared to middle-aged female mice and compared to both young male and female mice. The measure of memory revealed that young female mice made significantly less arm repeats and more unique arm visits before first arm repeat than middle-aged female and male mice. There are also significant differences between young female and young male mice with the former committing fewer errors than the latter."
"The motion aftereffect (MAE) describes an illusory motion in the opposite direction after the sudden halt of a prolonged moving visual stimulus. Behaviorally, this illusion was mostly analyzed in humans and other mammals. Up to now, birds were never tested. Since a new neural mechanism for the MAE was recently discovered in the pigeons' midbrain, the aim of this study was to investigate if pigeons can perceive this illusion. In two successive experiments, we trained animals to discriminate black and white grating patterns with two moving directions: upward or downward, or standing still. During transfer tests, animals were shortly confronted with the static pattern after prolonged exposure to a moving stimulus. The choice behaviors of these animals were highly indicative for the perception of an MAE. The possible neuronal substrate for the movement aftereffect is discussed."
"The present study examines how rats process object information in relation to other objects as well as to the global shape of an enclosure. Rats were introduced into either a round or a square arena with various arrays of freestanding portable corners (objects) that differed in spacing, orientation, and number. We found that the time spent at the objects was substantially higher in the round compared with the square arena. Rats in the square arena distributed their time evenly between arena perimeter and objects; however, they visited the objects more frequently than the perimeter. Rats tested in either round or square arena favored staying at the interior of the object regardless of its orientation in the arena. Finally, only geometric changes in the object array affected the rats' level of activity. These findings demonstrate that the rats were able to detect the geometry of the enclosure, the array, and the objects. We suggest that the context of the global enclosure geometry affects the meaning of landmarks (objects) for the observer, which in turn results in a different distribution of activity. Specifically, an object's local geometry served mainly in the context of a safe place in the round arena, as manifested in extended duration of stay at the objects, however in the square arena served mainly as a place of interest, as manifested in the frequent visits, but without their staying there. Thus, the geometries of the enclosure, the object array, and the discrete objects, together shape exploratory behavior in rats."
"It has been suggested that motor imagery possesses a range of useful applications in sport as well as in rehabilitation. Until now, research in this field has been hampered by the lack of an objective method to monitor the subjects' participation in the task. In this present study, a new approach to quantifying motor imagery of goal-directed hand movements by means of eye movement registration is examined. Eye movements of 15 right-handed subjects were recorded using EOG during both physical execution and visual motor imagery of a cyclical aiming task, performed at three different inter-target distances. We found that 89% of subjects made task-related eye movements during imagery with the eyes open and 84% of participants also did so during imagery with the eyes closed. Both the number and amplitude of the eye movements during imagery closely resembled those of eye movements made during physical execution of the task. This indicates that the coupling between neural patterns for eye and hand movements remains intact when hand movements are merely imagined as opposed to being physically executed. Therefore, eye movement recordings may be used as an objective technique to evaluate subjects' compliance, motor imagery ability, and spatial accuracy."
"The prenatal external environment can affect fetuses, altering the maternal behavior that they express when mature. In the present study, environmental prenatal stress (EPS) was applied to pregnant rats in their final week of gestation, and when their female offspring reached maturity, the long latency effect of the stress on those offspring was ascertained on their induced maternal behavior (MB), accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) morphology and plasma levels of ACTH and corticosterone (Cpd B). EPS reduced: the percentage of these virgins that showed induced MB, their retrieval of foster pups, the time spent crouching, and the quality of nest building; it also increased the incidence of their cannibalism of foster pups. The EPS-treated females presented a male-like pattern of induced MB. They showed increased plasma levels of ACTH and Cpd B and increased numbers of mitral cells in the AOB. These findings provide evidence that stress applied to the pregnant rat produces long-lasting behavioral, neuroanatomical and hormonal alterations in the female offspring that can be observed when they reach maturity."
"The role of directional compatibility was investigated during the production of in-phase and anti-phase coordination patterns involving both arms as well as the head. Our first aim was to compare the quality of coordination between both arms when symmetrical arm posture manipulations were used to disentangle muscle homology from the mutual direction of limb motions in extrinsic space. Findings revealed that in-phase coordination, characterized by the simultaneous activation of homologous muscle groups, was resistant to posture manipulations. Conversely, during anti-phase coordination, the influence of extrinsic direction became more prevalent whereby isodirectionality in extrinsic space contributed to stabilization of anti-phase coordination patterns. The second aim was to study the effect of periodic head movements upon the assembling of a coordinative synergy among the body segments. The findings demonstrated that the in-phase patterns were hardly affected by directionality of head motion. Conversely, the anti-phase patterns were more vulnerable to the directional influence of head movements, showing less accurate and stable coordination during non-isodirectional than isodirectional head motions. These observations underscore the robust nature of coordination patterns based on muscle homology, even in the absence of symmetric arm positions. Moreover, isodirectional head movements became easily integrated with the overall coordination pattern, whereas head-limb coupling was poor when the head moved anti-directional with the limbs."
"Pigeon hippocampal neurons display two spatial response profiles: location fields frequently at goals, and path fields connecting goals. We recorded from 15 location and six path cells, with color cues positioned near four goal locations. Following color cue rotation, most location cells (12/15) shifted their response fields; path cells (5/6) lost their fields. Therefore, local visual cues can independently define a reference frame for location cells, but path cells may be more broadly tuned to context or alternative reference frames."
"Developmental vitamin D (DVD) deficiency has been proposed as an environmental risk factor for a number of brain disorders. The absence of this vitamin during foetal development in the rat is known to alter behaviour in the adult, and many of these alterations are informative with respect to the clinical features of schizophrenia. Here we investigated whether DVD deficiency had a similar effect on 129/SvJ and C57BL/6J mice. Female mice were fed a diet deficient in vitamin D for 6 weeks prior to conception until birth, after which dams and their offspring were fed a normal diet (i.e. containing vitamin D). Control mice were fed a normal diet throughout the experiment. The adult offspring underwent a comprehensive behavioural test battery at 10 weeks of age. We found that DVD-deficient mice of both strains exhibited significantly higher levels of exploration, as measured by the frequency of head dipping on the hole board test. In addition, DVD-deficient 129/SvJ mice, but not C57BL/6J mice, displayed spontaneous hyperlocomotion. There was no effect of maternal diet on parameters assessed by the SHIRPA primary screen, or on tests of sensorimotor gating, social behaviour, anxiety or depression. Some of these findings resemble the rat phenotype (hyperlocomotion) but there are also novel effects of DVD deficiency on mouse behaviour (increased exploration). This study confirms that the developmental absence of this vitamin affects brain function in another species (mouse), and lends further weight to the hypothesis that DVD deficiency in humans may contribute to adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes."
"The neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin have been implicated in rodent social and affiliative behaviors, including social bonding, parental care, social recognition, social memory, vocalizations, territoriality, and aggression, as well as components of human social behaviors and the etiology of autism. Previous investigations of mice with various manipulations of the oxytocin and vasopressin systems reported unusual levels of ultrasonic vocalizations in social settings. We employed a vasopressin 1b receptor (Avpr1b) knockout mouse to evaluate the role of the vasopressin 1b receptor subtype in the emission of ultrasonic vocalizations in adult and infant mice. Avpr1b null mutant female mice emitted fewer ultrasonic vocalizations, and their vocalizations were generally at lower frequencies, during a resident-intruder test. Avpr1b null mutant pups emitted ultrasonic vocalizations similar to heterozygote and wildtype littermates when separated from the nest on postnatal days 3, 6, 9, and 12. However, maternal potentiation of ultrasonic vocalizations in Avpr1b null and heterozygote mutants was absent, when tested at postnatal day 9. These results indicate that Avpr1b null mutant mice are impaired in the modulation of ultrasonic vocalizations within different social contexts at infant and adult ages."
"The purpose of this research was to compare the locomotor abilities of rats with cervical dorsal spinal funicular (DF) lesions to those of rats with the same lesion at the mid-thoracic level. The dorsal funiculus, consisting of ascending sensory fibers and the main component of the corticospinal tract, was transected either at spinal level C2 or at T8. We examined limb force generation and limb timing and coordination during overground locomotion, as well as foot placement errors during locomotion over a horizontal ladder. At 6 weeks post-surgery, bilateral lesions of the cervical DF caused subtle but persistent changes in the generation of ground reaction forces and limb timing during overground locomotion, and caused persistent forelimb, but not hindlimb, errors during ladder crossing. In contrast, the same lesion at the mid-thoracic level did not affect overground locomotion and caused only minor forelimb and hindlimb errors during ladder walking at 2 weeks post-lesion which recovered to pre-surgical levels by 6 weeks post-lesion. DF lesions at cervical vs. thoracic levels thus have differential effects on locomotor abilities in rats. We compare these results with previous work and suggest that the differential response to DF transection might be related to both functional distinctions between the fore- and hindlimbs and to anatomical differences in the dorsal funiculi at different spinal levels. These findings have implications for the mechanisms of recovery as well as the types of behavioural tests which can be practically used to measure functional changes in different lesion models."
"The sublenticular central extended amygdala (SLEAc), which is important in medial forebrain bundle (MFB) self-stimulation, is heavily populated with GABAergic medium spiny neurons that intercommunicate via local axon collaterals. This study examines the role of GABAergic communication in the SLEAc in MFB self-stimulation. Male Long-Evans rats were given unilateral MFB stimulation electrodes and bilateral injection guide cannulae aimed at the SLEAc. Changes in the stimulation's reward efficacy and in the animals' ability to respond for stimulation following 0.5 microl injections of saline, 50 ng of muscimol (GABA-A agonist), 75 ng of baclofen (GABA-B agonist), 25 ng of bicuculline methiodide (GABA-A antagonist), and 500 ng of phaclofen (GABA-B antagonist) were assessed using the rate-frequency curve shift paradigm. Injecting the receptor agonists ipsi- and contralateral to the stimulation site substantially decreased stimulation reward efficacy and responding. Baclofen's effects were more anatomically specific to the SLEAc and baclofen was less challenging to response rate than was muscimol. Ipsi- and contralateral injections of the receptor blockers and saline had no effect on either stimulation reward efficacy or response rate, although the blockers, especially phaclofen, sometimes enhanced response rate when injected into the globus pallidus or ventral pallidum. Comparing these results to others' observations about GABAergic communication in the basal forebrain suggests that muscimol may have inhibited endemic SLEAc neurons while baclofen may have impaired the release of glutamate into the SLEAc from cortical and amygdalar afferents. These results also suggest functional differences between the two basal forebrain macrostructures of striatopallidum and extended amygdala."
"The time of weaning has numerous effects on neurobehavioral development. Previous findings suggest that the early weaning influences development of aggressive behaviors. Behavioral and neuroendocrine responsiveness to stressors in the adulthood are also influenced by maternal care received early in life, and early-weaned male mice and rats show higher responsiveness to acute stresses than do normally weaned males. Therefore, it is conceivable that early weaning influences stress-related aggressive behaviors. We investigated the effects of early weaning on aggressive behaviors under two stress conditions: social stress (social instigation) and ecological stress (food restriction), both of which augment aggression. Male ICR mice were divided into two groups based on weaning period. Normally weaned mice (weaned PD21) showed twice the baseline level of attack bites after 5 min of social instigation, whereas early-weaned animals (weaned PD14) were not more aggressive following social instigation. However, the early-weaned mice were more aggressive after food restriction stress than were the normally weaned mice, suggesting lower threshold for aggressive behavior after food shortage. We also measured 5HT1A and 5HT1B receptor mRNA expression in the hippocampus which involved in aggression using real-time PCR. Early-weaned mice had lower 5HT1B expression levels than did normally weaned mice; no effect was found for 5HT1A expression. These results suggest that manipulation of weaning time modulates adult aggressive behavior depending on the stressors imposed and that this change may involve the 5HT1B receptor system in the hippocampus."
"Glutaric acidemia type I (GA I) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency leading to predominant accumulation of glutaric acid (GA), and to a lesser extent of 3-hydroxyglutaric acid (3HG) in body fluids and tissues. The clinical manifestations of GA I are predominantly neurological. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the brain damage of this disease are virtually unknown, they are thought to be due to the neurotoxic actions of GA and 3HG. Therefore, in the present work we investigated whether chronic exposure of GA (5 micromol g of body weight(-1), twice per day), the major metabolite accumulating in GA I, during early development (from the 5th to the 28th day of life) could alter the cognitive performance of adult rats in the Morris water maze, open field and elevated plus maze tasks. Control rats were treated with saline in the same volumes. GA administration provoked an impairment of spatial performance in the water maze since adult rats pretreated with GA were not able to remember the previous location of the platform spending significantly less time in the training quadrant. In contrast, GA chronic administration did not affect rat performance in the open field and elevated plus maze tasks, indicating that motor activity and anxiety was not changed by GA. The results provide evidence that early chronic GA treatment induces long-lasting spatial behavioral deficit."
"Tests of executive abilities, such as discrimination reversal and attentional set shifting, are sensitive to prefrontal cortex (PFC) damage in primates. The purpose of the present study was to use a primate reversal task to determine if PFC in the mouse is involved in similar cognitive functions. Mice with lesions of medial PFC and Sham operated control animals were trained on a series of visual problems in a computer-automated touchscreen apparatus using stimuli that varied in either pattern (lines) or luminance (black-white). PFC-lesioned mice learned to discriminate both sets of stimuli as readily as controls, but displayed a stimulus specific (pattern only) deficit on the reversal task. Analysis of error patterns on the line reversal suggests the deficit exhibited by PFC-lesioned mice was related to stimulus specific aspects of visual attention, rather than perseveration. These results demonstrate that medial PFC may play a role in control of directed attention and provide further evidence that the touchscreen procedure can be a useful tool for examining functional similarities in brain regions of very diverse species."
"Endogenous opioids have long been implicated in mechanisms of appetite control. A significant strand in the evidence base has been the hypophagic action of broad-spectrum opioid receptor antagonists (such as naloxone) in opiate-na&#xef;ve animals. However, while much has been learned about sites of action, underlying receptor mechanisms and the role of taste hedonics, surprisingly little is known about the behavioural selectivity of naloxone-induced hypophagia. As such, two experiments employed detailed video analysis to profile the behavioural effects of naloxone (Experiment 1: 1.0-5.0 mg/kg; Experiment 2: 0.01-1.0 mg/kg) in non-deprived male rats during 1 h free-feeding tests with palatable mash. Results confirmed that, at doses &gt; or =1.0 mg/kg, naloxone consistently suppresses food consumption and feeding behaviour but, congruent with its short biological half-life, had no carryover effects on post-treatment weight gain. Crucially, the anorectic doses of naloxone did not alter the time taken to find food or to commence feeding, the time spent feeding in the initial phase of testing, or the rate at which food was consumed. Furthermore, they neither interfered with non-ingestive components of the behavioural repertoire (e.g. locomotion, rearing) nor did they disrupt the normal structure of feeding behaviour (the behavioural satiety sequence, BSS). Rather, the principal effect of naloxone was to produce a shift to the left in (i.e. accelerate) the BSS. Findings are discussed in relation to the role of (mu) opioid receptor mechanisms in taste hedonics and the likelihood of a naloxone-induced reduction in the orosensory reward that would normally accompany/follow the ingestion of palatable food."
"There is plenty of evidence from schizophrenia research and psychopharmacological experiments showing the influence of the dopaminergic neurotransmission on the prepulse inhibition (PPI). A lot of insights into the underlying neural mechanisms of the PPI have been gained from animal models, which are in need to be validated in humans. Due to new technological advances, findings from psychopharmacological challenge tests can now be verified with techniques from molecular genetics which provide an elegant non-invasive approach. To close the gap between animal research and research in humans in this field a molecular genetic approach was applied to investigate the neural mechanisms of the PPI in healthy subjects. In N=96 female participants recruited out of a sample of N=800 subjects according to their genotypes we tested the association between the DRD2 Taq Ia and the COMT Val158Met polymorphisms, and the magnitude of the eye-blink reflex in an acoustic PPI paradigm. Neither significant influences of both dopaminergic single nucleotide polymorphisms nor an epistasis effect could be detected. Although findings do not support the hypothesis that two of the most prominent dopaminergic candidate loci (DRD2 Taq Ia and COMT Val158Met) effect PPI the study does not exclude the relevance of the dopaminergic system in general. Further molecular genetic studies investigating other variants on dopaminergic genes have to be conducted."
"Different strategies can be used to carry dopamine into the brain such as L-Dopa precursors or galactosilated form of DA (GAL-DA). The aim of this study was to investigate whether GAL-DA would reduce hyperactivity and increase non-selective attention (NSA) in a mouse model of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as, i.e. C57BL/6 as did in NHE rats. Here we report that GAL-DA increases NSA in a spatial novelty in C57BL/6 mice. They received a single i.p. injection of GAL-DA (10 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg) or equimolar galactose vehicle. Another mouse strain the Swiss albino was introduced as inbred control group. Three hours after last injection mice were tested in a L&#xe0;t-maze for 30-min. Behaviour was analyzed for horizontal (traveled distance) and vertical activity (orienting frequency and scanning durations) which shares cognitive and non-cognitive nature, respectively. Ten milligram per kilograms of GAL-DA, increases scanning duration in C57BL/6 mice. Thus a low dose of GAL-DA increases NSA without reducing hyperactivity in this mouse model of ADHD."
"It is known that 5-HT(4) receptor agonists increase sAPPalpha levels in the cortex and hippocampus of mice as well as in a model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As sAPPalpha is thought to have pro-mnesic properties, we assessed whether its increase induces cognitive improvement in a spatial memory task and whether it reverses a scopolamine-induced memory deficit. Mice treated or not treated with scopolamine were trained in the Morris water maze for 3 days. Before the probe test, they received an injection of either a 5-HT(4) receptor agonist (prucalopride or RS 67333), or an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil), or both drugs. As expected, scopolamine decreased performance, an effect that was not reversed by the drugs tested when injected alone. However, prucalopride (5 mg kg(-1), s.c.) acted synergistically with donepezil (0.75 mg kg(-1), s.c.) to counteract completely scopolamine-induced amnesia. Western blot analysis of tissue homogenates in the cortex and hippocampus shows that sAPPalpha levels did not differ between saline- and scopolamine-treated mice. Furthermore, a region-dependent drug action was observed since the scopolamine-treated mice display a tendency to increase sAPPalpha levels in the hippocampus after donepezil or in the cortex after prucalopride. Our results suggest that a combined treatment with a 5-HT(4) receptor agonist with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor has beneficial effects on memory in mice. Moreover, it seems to enhance sAPPalpha levels in two brain regions highly affected in AD. Thus, a drug polytherapy could be interesting not only to enhance cognitive performance and decrease drawbacks but also to get the best action in each brain region."
"The present study investigated the long-term effects of ethanol consumption in rats. Subjects were maintained on either an ethanol (alcohol) (2.7-6.7%, v/v) or an isocaloric liquid control diet for 26 consecutive days (M=13.7 g/kg/day). Testing for working memory was conducted in a Morris water maze (2 trials/day for 8 days) and commenced after either a short (19 days) or long (120 days) abstinence period. This was followed by assessment of 72 h retention of passive avoidance. Animals were killed either 41 (short abstinence) or 152 days (long abstinence) post-ethanol and their brains stained with cresyl violet. Assessments of dorsal-ventral and medial-lateral cortical vertices were measured in sections derived from eight coronal planes extending +4.20 to -4.16 mm from Bregma. Results indicated that subjects in the ethanol/long abstinence group exhibited increased state anxiety due to their propensity to be thigmotaxtic (i.e., wall-hugging) in the water maze. Unfortunately, such a swim pattern precluded assessment of working memory in our subjects. No evidence of ethanol-induced memory decrements were observed on retention of passive avoidance. There was some evidence that animals in the ethanol/long abstinent group suffered cortical thinning and slight compression of the CA1 layer within the hippocampus, although age might have contributed to the former effect. It was concluded that chronic ethanol consumption increases anxiety even after an extended period of withdrawal and may conspire with age to affect cortical integrity."
"Experimental animals can be differentiated on the basis of their horizontal or vertical activity to high responders (HR) and low responders (LR) upon exposure to a novel environment. These individual differences have been associated with behavioral and neurobiological differences in a number of experimental procedures used for studying sensitivity to psychostimulants, anxiety, depression, and cognitive function. In the present study, we differentiated the rats to HR and LR based on their vertical activity upon exposure to a novel environment. Additionally, we ascertained whether HR and LR rats differ in a battery of tests such as passive avoidance (PA), object recognition (OR), and the water-maze (WM) that provide indices for cognitive function and the forced swim test (FST), an animal model of affective responsivity and antidepressant-like activity. Potential differences in neurochemical indices between the two phenotypes were also examined. HR rats displayed impaired non-spatial object recognition memory, but enhanced spatial performance, as compared to LR rats. FST induced ""depressive-like"" symptoms in both phenotypes that were differently manifested in HR versus LR rats. Neurochemical findings revealed distinct differences in serotonergic and dopaminergic activity in the striatum and the prefrontal cortex of HR as compared to LR rats. The above results show that HR and LR rats exhibit important differences in a battery of tests related to cognitive performance or affective responsivity, which may be associated with differences in certain neurobiological parameters."
"Impulsive violent criminal behavior is often ascribed to problems with behavioral control. Such behavior could be a consequence of stronger pre-potent responses or a failure of inhibitory control. A countermanding task which allows dissociation of these two processes was used to examine whether impulsive violent offenders were found to exhibit impaired inhibitory control. An experiment with a time restriction on responding was performed to effectively limit the ability of the subjects to strategically control their error rate. The results showed that the performance of the impulsive violent offenders was only impaired in the time pressure condition. These findings suggest that impulsive violent behavior may be linked to abnormal modulation of the frontal cortical areas, areas thought to be involved in response inhibition by negative feedback or emotional responses, rather than frontal dysfunction per se."
"Sub-chronic phencyclidine (PCP) treatment mimics certain aspects of schizophrenia symptomology in rats. However, there is a marked lack of attempts to model negative symptomology such as social behaviour deficits in female rats. This study was conducted to assess whether sub-chronic PCP treatment produces social interaction deficits in female rats and to ascertain if these deficits can be reversed by either typical (haloperidol) or atypical (clozapine and ziprasidone) antipsychotics."
"Recent lesion and non-invasive studies identify the medial temporal lobe, including the amygdala, not only with emotion but also with working memory in relation to the prefrontal cortex. In the present study, amygdalar neuronal activity was recorded from monkeys during performance of discrimination tasks that led to presentation of emotion-related (rewarding or aversive) stimuli. The task had three phases: (1) discrimination (visual, auditory), (2) operant response (bar pressing) and (3) ingestion (reward) or avoidance (aversion). These neurons were further analyzed by a short-term memory task, delayed pair comparison (DPC) using colored lamps. Of 585 amygdalar neurons, 107 responded primarily to single sensory stimulation (40 vision related, 26 audition related, 41 ingestion related), 117 to multimodal stimulation (multimodal) and 14 responded selectively to only one item (selective). Of 417 neurons tested by the DPC, 122 responded in one or more phases. Of these 122 neurons, 10.7% responded in the delay period. These delay-responsive neurons also responded to various objects with positive and negative affective significance. These results suggest that amygdalar neurons are not specifically related to working memory, as are those in the inferotemporal and prefrontal cortices, but are related to more general non-specific functions or processes such as arousal or attention during the cognitive tasks. A functional role of the amygdala in working memory is discussed in terms of recent non-invasive studies suggesting a functional coupling between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex."
"Age-related changes have been documented in regions of the brain shown to process reward information. However, few studies have examined the effects of aging on associative memory for reward. The present study tested 7- and 24-month-old rats on a conditioned flavor preference task. Half of the rats in each age group received an unsweetened grape-flavored solution (CS-) on odd-numbered days and a sweetened cherry-flavored solution (CS+) on even-numbered days. The remaining rats in each age group received a sweetened grape-flavored solution (CS+) on odd-numbered days and an unsweetened cherry-flavored solution (CS-) on even-numbered days. During the acquisition phase of testing, the designated solution (CS+ or CS-) was presented to each rat for 15 min daily across six consecutive days. On the preference phase, each rat received unsweetened cherry and unsweetened grape-flavored solutions simultaneously for 15 min daily across four consecutive days. The 7-month-old rats showed a significant preference for the flavor that was previously sweetened during the acquisition phase (CS+) compared to the previously unsweetened solution (CS-) when the two unsweetened solutions were presented simultaneously during the preference phase of testing. In contrast, the 24-month-old rats did not show a preference and consumed roughly equal amounts of the previously sweetened (CS+) and unsweetened (CS-) solutions. Thus, the data suggest that the ability to form flavor-reward associations declines with increasing age, resulting in impaired conditioned flavor preference."
"The hippocampus is essentially involved in learning and memory, and is known to be a target for androgen actions. Androgen receptors are densely expressed in CA1 of rat hippocampus, and mediate the effects of testosterone (T) on learning and memory. T depletion or administration can modulate neural function and cognitive performance. We conducted series of experiments to further investigate the effect of castration or intra hippocampal injection of T on acquisition, consolidation and retrieval of inhibitory avoidance learning and memory. Male adult rats were bilaterally cannulated into CA1 of hippocampus, and then received T (1, 10, 20, 40 and 80mug/0.5mul/side) or vehicle (DMSO), 30min before training, immediately after training and 30min before retrieval in inhibitory avoidance task. Castration was made by gonadectomy of male rats and behavioral tests performed 4 weeks later. Our results showed that gonadectomy of male rats did not influence performance on inhibitory avoidance task, as compared to sham-operated rats. We have also found that pre-training, post-training and pre-retrieval intra CA1 injections of T significantly decreased step-through latencies in inhibitory avoidance learning at doses 1 and 80, 20, and 20 and 40mug/0.5mul/side, respectively. The data suggest that intra CA1 administration of T could impair learning and memory acquisition, consolidation and retrieval, while systemic androgen's depletion have no effect on memory, in inhibitory avoidance task."
"Freezing defined as the complete absence of body movements is a normal response of animals to unavoidable fear stimuli. The present review presents a series of evidence relating different defensive patterns with specific anxiety disorders. There are at least four different kinds of freezing with specific neural substrates. The immobility induced by stimulation of the ventral column of the periaqueductal gray (vPAG) has been considered a quiescence characteristic of the recovery component of defense-recuperative processes. There is an isomorphism between freezing response to contextual stimuli paired with electrical shocks and generalized anxiety disorder. Besides, two types of freezing emerge with the electrical stimulation of the dorsal aspects of the periaqueductal gray (dPAG): the dPAG-evoked freezing and the dPAG post-stimulation freezing. Evidence is presented in support of the hypothesis that whereas dPAG-evoked freezing would serve as a model of panic attacks, the dPAG post-stimulation freezing appears to be a model of panic disorder. It is also proposed that conditioned freezing plus dPAG electrical stimulation might also mimic panic disorder with agoraphobia. A model of serotoninergic modulation through on- and off-cells of the defense reaction generated in the dPAG is also presented. The understanding of how the periaqueductal gray generates and elaborates different types of freezing is of relevance for our better knowledge of distinct types of anxiety such as panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder."
"A behavioural evaluation was carried out on three chronic models of hepatic encephalopathy: two models of type B HE, portacaval shunt (PCS) and portal hypertension (PH) and one of type C HE with cirrhosis and portal hypertension from thioacetamide intoxication (TAA). The tasks selected cover a wide range of behaviours related to: locomotion (rotarod-accelerod test), anxiety (open field and elevated plus maze) and memory (Morris water maze). The results indicate that neither locomotor activity nor anxiety was affected in our models, in comparison with their respective controls. However, this is not the case for the mnesic tasks. Hence, the PCS and TAA groups displayed a severe alteration in spatial reference memory and cannot correctly perform the Morris maze task, while this alteration is less severe in the PH group. On the contrary, the PH group revealed a deficit in spatial working memory, like the TAA group, but this does not occur in subjects with PCS. These results reveal a double dissociation in spatial reference memory and spatial working memory between the PCS and PH groups, which would be of great interest to study about cerebral causes and substrates of the alterations accompanying HE."
"The cholecystokinin B (2) receptor knockout (Cckbr KO) protects against allodynia induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI). The mechanism of this phenomenon is unknown, but must involve persistent changes in pain modulation and/or inflammatory pathways. We performed a gene expression study in two brain areas (midbrain and medulla) after surgical induction of CCI in Cckbr KO and wild-type (wt) control mice. The patterns of gene expression differences suggest that the immune system is activated in higher brain structures following CCI in the wt mice. The strongest differences include genes related to the MAPK pathway activation and cytokine production. In Cckbr KO mice this expressional pattern was absent. In addition, we found significant elevation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4) in the supraspinal structures of the mice with deleted Cckbr compared to wt control mice. This up-regulation is most likely induced by the deletion of Cckbr. We suggest that there is a functional deficiency in the Tlr4 pathway which disables the development of neuropathic pain in Cckbr KO mice. Indeed, real time PCR analysis detected a CCI-induced upregulation of Tlr4 and Il1b expression in the lumbar region of wt but not Cckbr KO mice. Gene expression profiling indicates that elements of the immune response are not activated in Cckbr KO mice following CCI. Our findings suggest that there may be a role for CCK in the regulation of innate immunity."
"We aimed to investigate the brain areas engaged in observation of hand movements with the intention of imitation or judging movement velocity. Both processes reflect different analytic approaches in movement observation. We were interested if these two processes can be distinguished or share common activation foci. Twelve healthy, right-handed volunteers were required to observe video clips of hand gestures and of object related grasping movements while the regional cerebral blood flow was measured using positron emission tomography. The subjects were instructed either to imitate the actions or to judge the velocity of the observed movements after scanning. Action observation with the instruction to judge movement velocity engaged bilaterally the temporo-occipital junction and adjacent visual cortical areas. In contrast, observation with the instruction to imitate them afterwards, yielded large activation clusters covering the left parietal and premotor cortex. Both contrasts demonstrated activation in the inferior frontal cortex, however, on opposite sides. Results suggest that movement observation with the goal of imitation activated specific areas of the parietal cortex in the dominant hemisphere probably related to programming of the movement kinematics. In contrast, observation with the goal to characterize the velocity of the finger movements activated the ventral visual pathways. Thus, movement observation recruits non-overlapping cortical networks, depending on the information attended to which are characterised by a dorsal ventral dissociation."
"The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN)-serotonin (5-HT) system plays a key role in stress-related psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression. The habenular nucleus (Hb) is closely connected with the DRN both morphologically and functionally. Here, we used two types of depressive animal models by exposing rats to chronic mild stress (CMS) and by chronically administering the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine (CLI) in the rat during the neonatal state of life to produce adult depressed rats. We investigated the effects of lateral habenular nucleus (LHb) lesions on the behavioral response and on the level of 5-HT in DRN in the depressed rats. Forced-swimming test (FST) showed that the immobility time decreased, and the climbing time increased after lesioning LHb of depressed rats. Microdialysis results indicated that the 5-HT level in DRN in depressed rats was lower than that of the control group. Lesion of the LHb was followed by an increased 5-HT turnover in the DRN. Our results suggested that the lesion of the LHb could improve the behavioral response of the depressed rats and the 5-HT level of the DRN increased by LHb lesions could be involved in the effects."
"This study investigated the effect of the AMPA receptor antagonist 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX) microinjected into the core and shell sub-regions of the accumbens nucleus (Acb), on the level of fear/anxiety and emotional learning, in female rats submitted to the elevated plus-maze (EPM), an animal model of anxiety. Bilateral microinjections of DNQX (330 and 660 ng) into the Acb shell (AP, +1.08 to +2.16) induced an anxiolytic-like effect in relation to rats microinjected with vehicle, since there was an increased percentage of entries in the open arms of the maze. The 660 ng DNQX microinjection into the Acb shell also increased the percentage of entries into the open arms in relation to 660 ng DNQX microinjection into the Acb core. Prior DNQX microinjections in both core and shell sub-regions of the Acb failed to impair the emotional learning, since the animals exhibited an increase of the open arm avoidance on EPM Trial 2 in relation to EPM trial 1. DNQX microinjections into both sub-regions of the Acb did not change the number of entries into the enclosed arms, either in the EPM Trial 1 or in the EPM Trial 2, which indicates an absence of drug-induced locomotor impairment. Similarly, DNQX microinjections into both sub-regions of the Acb failed to alter the total arm entries, rearing, grooming and head-dipping frequency. The anxiolytic-like effect induced by DNQX suggests that the AMPA receptor in the Acb shell, but not in the Acb core, may underlie anxiety regulation in the EPM."
"Although leptin causes negative energy balance by reducing food intake and increasing energy expenditure, the effect of leptin on spontaneous physical activity (SPA) is not clearly established. To test the hypothesis that leptin enhances SPA in rats, male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intracerebroventricularly (ICV) with either 10mug of leptin or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) before dark onset (12:00h) once daily for 5 successive days. The rats were individually housed in behavioral monitoring cages to measure feeding behavior and SPA throughout the study. Both groups had a diurnal pattern of SPA being low during the light period and high during the dark period. Specifically, there were two peaks of SPA during the dark period, with the first peak taking place around the dark onset and the second occurring approximately 6h towards the light onset. Leptin treatment resulted in a significant increase in SPA whether or not it was expressed in terms of light-dark, daily or diurnal basis. Increased SPA was consistently observed throughout the entire 5-day study in spite of the fact that the rats were consistently eating less and losing body weight. With reduction in weight of fat pads and increase in apoptosis of fat pads but no change in body temperature, leptin decreased size, duration and number of meals without altering eating rate, thereby increasing satiety. Our data show that increased activity is a key determinant in negative energy balance induced by leptin, which cannot be accounted for solely by the leptin-induced food intake reduction."
"The contribution of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the modulation of ischemia-induced cell death in vivo remains unclear. We characterized the impact of pre-ischemic administration of CRH (0, 0.1, 1, 5 microg, i.c.v., 15 min prior to vessel occlusion) on neuronal damage following global ischemia in rats. The injection of 5 microg CRH led to a 37% increase in CA1 neuronal survival compared to vehicle-treated ischemic animals, while pre-treatment with alpha-helical CRH (9-41) abolished this neuronal protection. A second objective aimed to determine whether CRH protection is maintained over weeks when the peptide is administered at remote time intervals following ischemia. Compared to vehicle-treated ischemic animals, administration of CRH 8h following global ischemia led to a 61% increase in CA1 neuronal survival observed 30 days post-ischemia. Neuronal protection translated into significant improvement of ischemia-induced spatial memory deficits in the radial maze. Finally, our findings demonstrated that selective blockade of kappa- and delta-opioid receptors (using nor-binaltorphimine and naltrindole, respectively) prior to CRH administration significantly reduced CA1 neuronal protection. These findings represent the first demonstration of enhanced neuronal survival following in vivo CRH administration in a global model of ischemia in rats. They also support the idea that CRH-induced neuroprotection involves opioid receptors activation."
"Developmental exposure to alcohol can produce characteristic physiological and cognitive deficits, often termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). More recently, social deficits have been shown to occur both in FASD and animal models of FASD; the behavioral and neural bases of these deficits remain to be determined. It was hypothesized that changes in sensory processing may in part underlie the social deficits seen in FASD. This study used a rat model of FASD and social play, a behavior critical to adult social functioning, to begin to examine this hypothesis. Somatosensory cues from dorsal contact to the nape of the neck, critical to the initiation of pinning, were systematically degraded by administration of different doses of xylocaine, a topical anesthetic. Neuronal activity after 1h of play was assessed by measurement of c-Fos immunoreactivity (IR) in different brain regions. Ethanol-exposed rats showed an increased frequency of pinning during social play and were more sensitive to the degradation of somatosensory cues compared to the control groups, suggesting difficulties in processing somatosensory cues. Neuronal activity in the somatosensory cortex induced by play was significantly decreased in the ethanol-exposed group compared to the non-treated group. The c-Fos IR in the nucleus accumbens was altered in a sexually dimorphic manner in the ethanol-exposed group. Thus, the behavioral and brain measures are consistent with the hypothesis that ethanol exposure during development induces alterations in social play via deficits in processing somatosensory cues that are important to social play."
"Social interactions have previously been shown to influence stroke outcome. In the current experiment we investigated the effects of a changing social environment on anatomical and behavioral recovery following motor cortex stroke in rats. Adult rats were trained on the Whishaw single pellet reaching task prior to receiving a devascularizing stroke lesion of the motor cortex. During the post-stroke testing period half of the rats were exposed to a form of social experience that has previously been shown to stimulate synaptic plasticity in frontal cortex circuitry, whereas the remaining rats were housed in pairs, in standard cages. At the end of the experiment the brains were processed for Golgi-Cox staining and dendritic length was measured in layer V of the intact forelimb motor area, layer III of Zilles' area Cg3 and layer II/III of Zilles' area AID. Social experience was found to completely block the normal spontaneous behavioural restitution in the lesion animals. Anatomically, whereas social experience selectively increased dendritic length in AID in rats that had not undergone behavioral training or the stroke procedure, this was not seen in the lesion animals, as the lesion alone produced an increase in dendritic length in both AID and Cg3. The findings are discussed in terms of the role of social experiences, including stress, on spontaneous plasticity that occurs following unilateral motor cortex stroke, and the effectiveness of inducing synaptic plasticity to promote behavioural recovery."
"Zebrafish (zebra danio) are becoming increasingly popular in behavioral neuroscience and behavior genetics. This small vertebrate may be utilized in modeling human brain disorders. One of the major neuropsychiatric conditions still not well understood is abnormally increased fear and anxiety. Zebrafish may be an appropriate organism with which these human diseases can be modeled and their biological mechanisms investigated. Predator induced anxiety paradigms have been suggested as useful methods in translational research. Shoaling fish, such as zebrafish, are known to respond to alarm substances with antipredatory or alarm reactions. However, these responses are not well characterized in zebrafish. In the current paper, we investigate the behavioral responses of zebrafish elicited by its alarm substance. Using observation-based as well as video-tracking aided behavior quantification methods we demonstrate significant alarm substance-induced behavioral changes that are independent of the presence of a predatory fish stimulus. The results suggest that, once refined, the use of alarm substance with zebrafish will allow the development of high throughput behavioral paradigms for drug and mutation screening aimed at the analysis of the biological mechanisms of fear in vertebrates."
"The teneurin C-terminal associated peptides (TCAP) are a recently discovered family of peptides encoded by a bioactive neuropeptide-like gene sequence found at the carboxy terminus of the teneurin transmembrane proteins. TCAP is structurally related to the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family of peptides. Synthetic TCAP-3 and TCAP-1 are active in vitro in stimulating cAMP and proliferation in neuronal lines. TCAP-1 mRNA is expressed in limbic brain regions and modulates acoustic startle behavior in rats when injected into the basolateral amygdala. In the current study, TCAP-1 was administered into the cerebral ventricles once per day for 5 days to rats. At 1-3 weeks after the last TCAP-1 treatment, the rats were tested in the elevated plus maze, open field test, or the acoustic startle test, with or without an acute CRF injection 30 min prior to the test. The results show a difference in behavioral response between TCAP-treated and saline-treated rats, but only when an acute CRF challenge is delivered prior to testing. In the plus maze and open field tests, acute CRF effects were enhanced by prior TCAP-1 treatment, whereas in the acoustic startle test, the acute CRF effects were diminished by prior TCAP-1 administration."
"The aim of the study was to examine the neurochemical background of differences in the individual responses to conditioned aversive stimuli, using the strength of a rat conditioned freezing response (the contextual fear test), as a discriminating variable. It was shown that low responders (LR), i.e. rats with duration of a freezing response one standard error, or more, below the mean value, had a higher activity of the M2 cortical area, and the median raphe nucleus (c-Fox expression), in comparison to the high responders (HR), i.e. rats with the duration of a freezing response one standard error, or more, above the mean value. These animals had also stronger 5-HT- and CRF-related immunostaining in the M2 area, and increased concentration of GABA in the basolateral nucleus of amygdala (in vivo microdialysis). The LR group vocalized more during test session in the aversive band, and had higher serum levels of corticosterone, examined 10 min after test session. It was shown that different natural patterns of responding to conditioned aversive stimuli are associated with different involvement of brain structures and with dissimilar neurochemical mechanisms."
"Here we examined immediate early gene (ZENK) induction to vocalizations in the ascending auditory pathway of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) to assess the impact that the sex of the producer and perceiver has on ZENK induction. We manipulated the playback by both the vocal type (song/call) and sex of producer (male/female), and then presented these stimuli classes to either male or female black-capped chickadees. Neural response to the stimulus was quantified by the amount of protein of the IEG ZENK (also known as zif-268, egr-1, ngf-Ia and krox-24) in the caudal medial nidopallium (NCM) and caudomedial mesopallium (CMM). Overall, there was more ZENK induction in CMM and the dorsal parts of the caudal medial nidopallium (NCMd) than in the ventral parts of the caudal medial nidopallium (NCMv) and males had more ZENK induction than females. CMM had the most complex responding of ZENK induction to stimuli such that vocalization type, sex of producer, and sex of perceiver all affected ZENK induction. The silence controls had the least ZENK induction compared to any other group."
"Unpredicted rewards, but not predicted ones, trigger strong phasic changes in the firing rates of midbrain dopamine (DA). In contrast, neurochemical measurements of DA tone have failed to reveal an influence of reward predictability. However, the subjects of the neurochemical experiments were asked to predict reward onset over longer intervals (12s, on average) than the subjects of the electrophysiological studies (typically, 2s). Thus, the contrasting effects of reward predictability could reflect the difference in the duration of the interval separating the predictor from the reward rather than a difference in the influence of reward predictability on phasic and tonic DA signaling. This hypothesis was tested in rats receiving trains of rewarding electrical brain stimulation with either a predictable or unpredictable onset. The mean inter-train interval was 1.5s, a value close to the 2-s CS-US interval that has been used in electrophysiological studies demonstrating the dependence of phasic DA responses on reward predictability. Despite the shortened inter-train interval, the time courses of the observed stimulation-induced elevations in DA levels were very similar, regardless of whether train onset was predictable. This finding is consistent with the idea that tonic DA signaling is insensitive to the predictability of rewards."
"Leptin is a key signal linking peripheral adiposity levels to the regulation of energy homeostasis in the brain. The injection of leptin decreases body weight and food intake in lean rodents; however, in a rodent model of high fat diet-induced obesity (DIO), the exogenous leptin cannot improve adiposity. This ineffectiveness is known as leptin resistance, and the factors downstream of leptin signaling have received attention as viable targets in the treatment of obesity. We previously reported that the histaminergic system is one of the targets of leptin. In the present study, the effect of an H(3)-receptor inverse agonist on hypothalamic histamine release and energy intake was investigated in normal and DIO mice. Leptin (1.3 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly increased hypothalamic histamine release and reduced 12 h-energy intake in normal mice, but had no such effects in DIO mice. In contrast, clobenpropit (5 mg/kg, i.p.), an H(3)-inverse agonist, elicited a significant increase in histamine release in both types of mice. Clobenpropit did not reduce 12 h-energy intake; however, it decreased 3 h-energy intake in both types of mice. These results suggest that lack of the activation of the histaminergic system partly contributes to obesity in DIO mice and direct activation of the histaminergic system circumvents leptin resistance."
"Neurological phenotypes associated with loss of caveolin 1 (cav-1) (the defining structural protein in caveolar vesicles, which regulate signal transduction and cholesterol trafficking in cells) in mice have been reported recently. In brain, cav-1 is highly expressed in neurons and glia. We investigated emotional and cognitive behavioural domains in mice deficient in cav-1 (CavKO mice). CavKO mice were more anxious and spent more time in self-directed grooming behaviour than wild-type (wt) mice. In a spatial/working memory task, CavKO mice failed to recognize the object displacement, thus showing a spatial memory impairment. CavKO mice showed higher locomotor activity than wt mice, thus suggesting reduced inhibitory function by CNS cholinergic systems. Behavioural response to the cholinergic muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine (2 mg/Kg), was decreased in CavKO mice. Few behavioural sex differences emerged in mice; whereas the sex differences were generally attenuated or even reverted in the null genotype. Our data confirm a distinct behavioural phenotype in CavKO mice and indicate a selective alteration in central cholinergic function."
"Iron deficiency in early development has been associated with irreversible alterations in brain myelination, but whether these neural changes are mirrored in altered behaviors in rats is not known. The goals were to determine if dietary induced gestational and lactational iron deficiency alters brain myelination and behaviors dependent on that system. Pregnant rats were randomly assigned to control (CN) or iron-deficient (ID) groups by providing iron-sufficient (40 ppm Fe) or iron-deficient (2-6 ppm Fe) diets from gestational day 5 through to weaning of pups. Thereafter, all offspring were fed the iron-sufficient diet. The myelination of subcortical white matter and the fimbria of hippocampus was measured by 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase (CNPase, marker of oligodendrocyte) density at 25 days of age. Specific behavioral assessments were performed at multiple time points after birth. By contrast, ID rats had significantly lower density of CNPase in the subcortical white matter but the density of CNPase in fimbria of hippocampus was comparable to CN rats. Moreover, ID rats showed significant behavioral impairments in surface righting reflex, negative geotaxis reflex, vibrissae-evoked forelimb placing test and novel object recognition task. In conclusion, perinatal iron deficiency can significantly alter behavioral outcomes which may be due to delayed myelination in specific brain regions."
"When administered systemically, the noradrenergic neurotoxin N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4) appears to target the noradrenergic innervation originating in the locus coeruleus causing long-term decrements in noradrenergic function. In songbirds, DSP-4-treatment decreased female-directed singing by males and copulation solicitation responses of females to male songs. However, DSP-4 treatment in songbirds did not lower measures of NE function in the brain to the same extent as it does in mammals. The current study had two goals: determining if two DSP-4 treatments 10 days apart would cause significant decrements in noradrenergic function in male zebra finches and determining if, as in other species, the noradrenergic innervation of midbrain and cortical areas would be profoundly affected while hypothalamic areas were spared. Dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunoreactivity (DBH-ir) was quantified in thirteen brain regions (five vocal control nuclei, one auditory nucleus, two hypothalamic nuclei, and five additional areas that demonstrated high DBH labeling in controls). Within 20 days, DSP-4 treatment profoundly reduced the number of DBH-ir cells in both the locus coeruleus and ventral subcoeruleus. Unlike a previous study, DBH labeling delineated four out of five vocal control nuclei and an auditory nucleus. As expected, DSP-4 treatment significantly decreased DBH labeling in all areas examined in the mesencephalon and telencephalon without significantly affecting DBH-ir in hypothalamic areas. This double treatment regime appears to be much more effective in decreasing noradrenergic function in songbirds than the single treatment typically used."
"Anxiolytic-like effects of DOI, a 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist have been observed in the four plates test (FPT) after intra-peritoneal administrations. In the present study, DOI (1 microg, 2 microg or 5 microg per mice) was directly injected to three brain structures, the hippocampus, the amygdala and the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG). Tests were carried out immediately after injections. In amygdala and PAG, DOI exerted an anxiogenic-like effect. In the hippocampus, a strong anxiolytic-like effect was found only when injecting 5 microg DOI/mice in the FPT, with a size effect comparable to the anxiolytic-like effect of diazepam 1mg/kg injected intra-peritoneally. DOI or vehicle injections did not affect locomotor activity. These results help us to understand mechanisms of action of DOI in animal models of anxiety, probably through an interaction with other neurotransmitter system, which may take place in the hippocampus."
"In a passive avoidance paradigm, administration of scopolamine in mice seems to provoke forgetting of electric shocks they received when entering into the black compartment. We observed that, in fact, scopolamine reduced the shocks perception. Since, on the hot plate test, scopolamine did not affect latencies of avoidance reactions, this effect did not correspond to analgesia. Thus, in our experimental conditions, scopolamine effect did not exclusively result from a deficit of passive avoidance learning but likely resulted from its anti-sweating properties, thus reducing the shocks perception."
"Efflux transporters, like P-glycoprotein (P-gp), may limit the access of drugs to the brain via the blood-brain barrier. The antipsychotic drug risperidone and its active metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone (paliperidone) are substrates of P-gp. Motor behavior of P-gp deficient mice (mdr1a/1b (-/-, -/-)) and wild type animals on a rotarod after acute doses of risperidone or haloperidol, a nonsubstrate of P-gp, were analysed aiming to show that P-gp substrate properties of an antipsychotic drug have functional consequences. Behavioral tests revealed dose-dependent effects of 0.3-3 mg/kg risperidone in wild type animals 0.5-12 h after i.p. injection of the drug. In knockout mice the 0.3 mg/kg dose of risperidone was as effective as the 3 mg/kg dose in wild type mice. A dose of 0.3 mg/kg haloperidol, however, exhibited similar pharmacodynamic effects in both genotypes. Brain concentrations of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone were 10-fold higher in knockout than in wild type animals whereas brain concentrations of haloperidol did not differ between the two genotypes. P-gp-dependent brain distribution kinetics and behavioral effects of risperidone give evidence that the expression of P-gp has an impact on psychotropic drug actions when treating patients with drugs that are substrates of P-gp."
"There are experimental evidences indicating that the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 impairs cognition and produces a series of schizophrenia-like symptoms in rodents (hypermotility, stereotypies and ataxia). The present study was designed to investigate the efficacy of the selective 5-HT(6) receptor antagonist Ro 04-6790 in counteracting these MK-801-induced behavioural effects in the rat. The effects of Ro 04-6790 in antagonizing MK-801-induced memory deficits were assessed using the object recognition task. The ability of this 5-HT(6) receptor antagonist in counteracting hypermotility, stereotypies and ataxia produced by MK-801 were evaluated in a motor activity cage. Post-training administration of Ro 04-6790 (10 and to some extent also 3mg/kg) antagonized MK-801-induced performance deficits in a recognition memory test. In a subsequent study, Ro 04-6790 (3 and 10 mg/kg) reversed hypermotility and ataxia produced by MK-801. This 5-HT(6) receptor antagonist also alleviated MK-801-induced certain stereotypies. Our findings indicate that Ro 04-6790 attenuates behavioural effects related to the hypofunction of the NMDA receptor suggesting that this compound might be involved in the psychotomimetic effects of non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists."
"Genetic and environmental factors play a key role in psychiatric disorders. While some disorders display exceptionally high heritability, others show gene x experience x personality interactions, contributing complexity to psychiatric phenotypes. As some brain disorders frequently overlap and co-occur (representing a continuum or spectrum of phenomena), modern psychiatry is shifting from ""artificial"" heterogeneity to the recognition of common elements in the pathogenesis of emotional, personality and behavioral disorders. Genetic animal models of these disorders represent an important direction of research, and are widely used to explore the role of different genes in brain mechanisms. Several concepts (such as endophenotypes, gene x environment interactions, and cross-species trait genetics) have been suggested for animal experimentation in this field. Here we develop a new concept based on targeting the complex interplay between different behavioral domains, meant to foster high-throughput phenotyping and integrative modeling of psychiatric disorders."
"We investigated the antidepressant-like effect of zinc chloride (zinc) administered acutely during 7 days (i.p. route), or chronically during 30 days (oral route) in the forced swimming test (FST) in rats. It was also investigated whether the antidepressant-like effect of zinc is associated with changes in the glutathione antioxidant system in the Wistar rat brain. Animals receiving a single zinc dose (5, 15 and 30 mg/kg, i.p.) 24 h prior to analysis showed no changes in the FST, but glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase activity were reduced in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. This treatment did not, however, affect the glutathione status (GSH and GSSG) in both brain structures. The 7-day zinc treatment (1, 5 and 15 mg/kg, i.p.) caused a mild though significant antidepressant-like effect in the FST at the highest dosing, without affecting the glutathione antioxidant system. Finally, a consistent antidepressant-like effect was achieved in the FST after chronic (30 days) zinc treatment (300 mg/L, p.o.). This was accompanied by a significant increase in total glutathione levels in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The good response to oral treatment in the FST led us to investigate other variables, such as ERK phosphorylation and BDNF expression. Similar to therapeutic antidepressants, zinc in chronic oral treatment produced an increase in ERK phosphorylation and BDNF expression in the cerebral cortex. It is our hypothesis that up-regulation of neuroprotective effectors (GSH, ERK and BDNF) may be related to the antidepressant properties of zinc, but this will require additional work to be confirmed."
The aim of this study was to characterize the behavioral effects of systemically administered agmatine in animal models predictive of antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like activity and clarify whether the effects of agmatine depend on the intact serotonergic system. Only the highest dose of agmatine tested (50 mg/kg) decreased immobility of mice in the forced swimming test. The magnitude of the effect was slightly smaller than that of the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (15 mg/kg). Agmatine did not change the locomotion of mice in the open field. Pretreatment with the tryptophane hydroxylase inhibitor PCPA for 3 days resulted in more than 70% drop in the tissue levels of 5-HT and 5-HIIA but did not counteract the antidepressant-like effect of agmatine. The administration of agmatine did not modify behavior of animals in the light-dark compartment test of anxiety. We conclude that the antidepressant-like effect of agmatine seems not to be mediated by the serotonergic system. We failed to confirm the reported anxiolytic-like activity of agmatine.
"Senescence-accelerated prone mouse 6 (SAMP6) is a model for senile osteoporosis. It was recently reported that SAMP6 has a memory deficit in the water maze test. Because emotion and cognition are thought to interact, in the present study to examine emotional behavior in SAMP6, we employed a battery of tasks (open field, elevated plus maze, light-dark exploration, marble-burying behavior, tail suspension), using three age groups (1, 4, and 8 months of age) of SAMP6 mice and age-matched control SAMR1 (senescence-accelerated resistant mouse 1) mice. All three age groups of SAMP6 showed higher activity than SAMR1 in the open field test and reduced anxiety as measured in terms of time spent on the open arms in the elevated plus maze, time spent in the light box in the light-dark exploration, and time spent in marble-burying behavior in the marble-burying test. All three age groups of SAMP6 showed reduced immobility time compared with SAMR1 in the tail suspension test. Western blot analyses showed increased expression levels of tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylated at serine-40 in striatum and nucleus accumbens and of tryptophan hydroxylase phosphorylated at serine-58 in brain stem of 1-month-old SAMP6. These results suggest that one possible reason for the alterations of motor activity and emotional behavior of SAMP6, at least after 1 month of age, is increased dopamine and serotonin levels."
"It has been suggested that the hippocampus mediates episodic memory processing involving snapshot memory and temporal sequence learning. To test this theory, rats learned trial-unique sequences of spatial locations along a runway box and were tested on recall by removing one of the locations in the sequence and making the rat choose the correct location to be rewarded. Once animals were able to reliably perform this episodic memory task, they received lesions to either CA3 or CA1. Animals with lesions to either CA3 or CA1 had difficulty with episodic memory processing, although CA1 lesioned animals had a much greater deficit. However, when animals were trained on a non-episodic version of the same task, hippocampal lesions had no effect. These results suggest that CA3 and CA1 both contribute to episodic memory processing since lesions to CA3 or CA1 result in an inability to process spatial information episodically, whereas they have no effect on non-episodic information processing."
"Increased impulsivity is observed across a number of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Preclinical evidence has demonstrated that antagonism of the serotonin 5-HT(2C) receptor may act to increase impulsivity, leading to the hypothesis that an agonist may exert reciprocal effects and attenuate impulsive behavior. The 5-HT(2C) agonist, WAY-163909, was evaluated in the present paper using a variable stimulus duration and inter-trial interval manipulation in the 5-choice serial reaction time test designed to increase impulsivity and decrease attention. WAY-163909 treatment selectively and dose-dependently decreased impulsivity suggesting that agonism of the 5-HT(2C) receptor may be useful for modulating impulsivity in disease states where impulsivity is a pathological feature."
"Perinatal phencyclidine (PCP) treatment leads to neuronal damage and causes long-term behavioural alterations in rodents. This study examined the effects of perinatal PCP treatment on behaviour of adult rats in holeboard, elevated plus maze, social interaction and forced swim tests. PCP-treated rats displayed hyperactivity in the holeboard and forced swim tests. These persistent behavioural changes are relevant to the study of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia."
"Animal models of repeated stressor exposure have generally been limited to physical stressors, despite the fact that the purpose of such models is to represent repeated stress in humans, which is usually psychological in nature. The present study was undertaken to investigate the behavioural, endocrine, and neural responses to a repeated psychological stressor exposure in male and female rats. Long-Evans rats were exposed to cat odour or a control condition for 1 h each day from Day 1 to Day 22. Every fourth day, defensive (e.g. hiding), and non-defensive (e.g. grooming) behaviour was quantified, during both the initial and the final 10 min of the hour. Defensive behaviours in cat odour-exposed animals remained vigorous during the initial 10 min of exposure across 22 exposure days. Non-defensive behaviours were suppressed during early exposures, but this suppression habituated across repeated exposures. Overall, the pattern of behavioural results indicated enhanced responses to novelty and to repeated cat odour exposure, in females, relative to males. Plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels were higher in females relative to males overall. However, males, but not females, exposed to cat odour had higher levels of CORT following exposure on Days 1 and 22, relative to controls. Finally, mRNA levels of glucocorticoid receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, all of which are modulated by CORT, were examined in hippocampus at the completion of stressor exposure, but none was affected by repeated stressor exposure. Results are discussed within the context of potential differences in effects of repeated psychological versus physical stressors."
"The Ts65Dn mouse is the most commonly used model of Down syndrome. This mouse shows many phenotypic characteristics present in people with Down syndrome, including behavioral and cognitive deficits. SGS-111 is a novel analogue of the nootropic piracetam, which prevents oxidative damage and apoptosis in both normal and Down syndrome human cortical neurons. In this work we tested the ability of chronic administration of SGS-111 to adult Ts65Dn mice to reverse the cognitive deficit found in these mice. Moreover, since oxidative stress has been reported as early as the fetal stage, SGS-111 was also administered to pregnant Ts65Dn females from the day of conception throughout the pregnancy and to Ts65Dn pups during their entire life (5 months), from birth to the end of the behavioral testing period. A characterization of the effects of SGS-111 treatment on Ts65Dn and control mice sensorimotor abilities, motor coordination, spontaneous activity, activity in the open field, exploration, anxiety and spatial and non-spatial short- and long-term learning and memory was performed. The behavioral characterization showed that chronic administration of the antioxidant SGS-111 reduced the hyperactivity shown by Ts65Dn mice in their home cage, in the open field and in the hole board test. SGS-111 administration during adulthood improved performance in the first session in the Morris water maze in control mice, and when administered during the pre- and post-natal periods, improved spatial learning in the control mice but not in Ts65Dn mice. Chronic SGS-111 administration failed to affect behavior and cognition in Ts65Dn mice."
"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) damages fronto-striatal regions, and is associated with deficits in executive functioning. We recently developed a semantic event sequencing task based on the Picture Arrangement subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III for use with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and found recruitment of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia in healthy participants. To assess the impact of HIV on the functioning of the basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex, we administered this task to 11 HIV+ and 11 Control participants matched for age and education. Neuropsychological evaluation demonstrated that the HIV+ group had mild impairment in memory retrieval and motor functioning, but was not demented. Morphometric measurements suggested no atrophy in basal ganglia regions. The results of the fMRI analysis revealed hypoactivation of the left caudate, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and bilateral ventral prefrontal cortex in the HIV+ group. Functional connectivity analysis demonstrated less functional connectivity between the caudate and prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia regions in the HIV+ group. In contrast, the HIV+ group demonstrated increased activation of right postcentral/supramarginal gyrus, and greater connectivity between the caudate and this same anterior parietal region. The results of this study extend previous investigations by demonstrating compromised function of the caudate and connected prefrontal regions in HIV during cognition. This disruption of fronto-striatal circuitry likely precedes the development of cognitive impairment in HIV."
"The limbic system-associated membrane protein (LAMP) is a GPI-anchored cell adhesion molecule expressed heavily in limbic and limbic-associated regions of the developing and adult brain. Experimental studies show that LAMP promotes the growth of limbic neurons and guides the projections of limbic fibers. In order to examine the functional consequences of disrupting limbic circuit assembly, we generated a mouse line in which the Lsamp gene encoding LAMP was deleted. Basic neuroanatomical organization and sensory and motor development are normal in Lsamp(-/-) mice. The most profound change in behavior in both male and female Lsamp(-/-) mice is a heightened reactivity to novelty exhibited in several behavioral tests. Lsamp(-/-) mice display hyperactivity in a novel arena and both sexes habituate to the same activity levels as their wild type littermates, but at different rates. In the elevated plus maze, Lsamp(-/-) mice exhibit increased total arm entries, with a bias towards the open arms; they spend more time in the open arms and have a substantial increase in the amount of risk assessment in unprotected areas of the maze. In the y-maze, Lsamp(-/-) mice exhibit characteristic hyperactivity and a decreased level of spontaneous alternation during the period when their novelty-induced hyperactivity is at its peak. We hypothesize that Lsamp(-/-) mice may not simply exhibit a decrease in anxiety, but may have a heightened, and possibly maladaptive, response to novel environmental stressors. Genetic deletion of Lsamp may thus cause circumscribed changes in the fine connectivity of specific circuits that underlie these behaviors."
"Growing evidence indicates that 5-hydrohytryptamine (5-HT) receptors mediate learning and memory. Particularly interesting are 5-HT(6) and 5-HT(7) receptors, which are localized in brain areas involved in memory formation. Interestingly, recently selective 5-HT(6) and 5-HT(7) receptor agonists and antagonists have become available. Previous evidence indicates that 5-HT(6) or 5-HT(7) receptors antagonists had no effects, improved memory formation and/or reversed amnesia. Herein, the effects of EMD (a 5-HT(6) receptor agonist) and AS19 (a 5-HT(7) receptor agonist) in the associative learning task of autoshaping were studied. Post-training systemic administration of EMD (1-10 mg/kg) or AS19 (1-10 mg/kg) were tested in short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM). Results showed that only EMD 5.0mg/kg impaired both STM and LTM. AS19 at 1-10 mg/kg significantly impaired STM but not LTM. In those groups used to test only LTM, EMD impaired it; while AS19 improved LTM. Moreover, in the interaction experiments, the STM EMD-impairment effect was partially reversed by the selective 5-HT(6) receptor antagonist SB-399885 (10 mg/kg). The STM AS19-impairment effect (5.0 mg/kg) was not altered by the selective 5-HT(1A) antagonist WAY 100635 (0.3 mg/kg) but reversed by the selective 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist SB-269970 (10.0 mg/kg). The AS19-SB-269970 combination impaired LTM. Taken together these data suggest that the stimulation of 5-HT(6) impaired both STM and LTM. 5-HT(7) receptors stimulation impaired STM but improved LTM. And these results are discussed in the context of their possible neural bases."
"Interactions with peers become particularly important during adolescence, and age differences in social interactions have been successfully modeled in rats. To determine the impact of social deprivation on social interactions under anxiogenic (unfamiliar) or non-anxiogenic (familiar) test circumstances during ontogeny, the present study used a modified social interaction test to assess the effects of 5 days of social isolation or group housing on different components of social behavior in early [postnatal day (P) 28], mid (P35), or late (P42) adolescent and adult (P70) male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. As expected, testing in an unfamiliar environment suppressed social interactions regardless of age, housing, and sex. Social deprivation drastically enhanced all forms of social behavior in P28 animals regardless of test situation, whereas depriving older animals of social interactions had more modest effects and was restricted predominantly to play fighting -- an adolescent-characteristic form of social interactions. Social investigation -- more adult-typical form of social behavior was relatively resistant to isolation-induced enhancement and was elevated in early adolescent isolates only. These findings confirm that different forms of social behavior are differentially sensitive to social deprivation across ontogeny."
"Dopamine (DA) has, as of late, become singled out from the profusion of other neurotransmitters as what could be called a key substance, in the regulation of the sleep-wake states. We have hypothesized that dopaminergic D(2) receptor blockage induced by haloperidol could generate a reduction or even an ablation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Otherwise, the use of the selective D(2) agonist, piribedil, could potentiate REM sleep. Electrophysiological findings demonstrate that D(2) blockage produced a dramatic reduction of REM sleep during the rebound (REB) period after 96 h of REM sleep deprivation (RSD). This reduction of REM sleep was accompanied by an increment in SWS, which is possibly accounted for the observed increase in the sleep efficiency. Conversely, our findings also demonstrate that the administration of piribedil did not generate additional increase of REM sleep. Additionally, D(2) receptors were found down-regulated, in the haloperidol group, after RSD, and subsequently up-regulated after REB group, contrasting to the D(1) down-regulation at the same period. In this sense, the current data indicate a participation of the D(2) receptor for REM sleep regulation and consequently in the REM sleep/SWS balance. Herein, we propose that the mechanism underlying the striatal D(2) up-regulation is due to an effect as consequence of RSD which originally produces selective D(2) supersensitivity, and after its period probably generates a surge in D(2) expression. In conclusion we report a particular action of the dopaminergic neurotransmission in REM sleep relying on D(2) activation."
"In addition to its role in neuronal migration during embryonic development, doublecortin (DCX) plays a role in hippocampal neurogenesis across the lifespan. Hippocampal neurons exhibit a high degree of synaptic plasticity while they are in the DCX phase. While previous studies have reported that behavioral training on hippocampus-dependent tasks can enhance neuron survival, little was known about the stage of development of those neurons and, particularly, whether a large pool of the surviving new neurons remains in the DCX phase for a prolonged period after training. Here we report that spatial navigation training increases the pool of neurons that are in the DCX phase 4 weeks after training ended. Thus, the stock of DCX-expressing neurons in the hippocampus is affected by whether a hippocampus-dependent task has been encountered during the preceding few weeks."
"Stress and antidepressants have been shown to influence hippocampal neurogenesis, which is hypothesized to be an etiological factor of depression. Robust ischemia-stimulated neurogenesis implies the existence of an innate response and rehabilitation mechanism to injury repair, i.e. cognitive recovery. We investigated whether unpredictable chronic mild stress (CMS) influences ischemia-stimulated compensatory neurogenesis in the hippocampus and also studied the therapeutic effect of citalopram. Adult rats were exposed to the CMS paradigm after left middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The open-field test (OFT) and the sucrose consumption test were employed to assess depression-like behaviour. The survival and fate of proliferating cells was monitored by labelling with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and other cell markers. Cell proliferation was examined 1 day after the last BrdU injection, and survival and differentiation were determined up to 45 days after ischemia. The number of BrdU-positive cells that were labelled using the 2 protocols and the proportion of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) ipsilateral to ischemia were higher than in the control. CMS induced depressive behaviours in ischemic rats, and this was accompanied by reduced proliferation and survival/neurogenic fate. All these effects were reversed by citalopram administration. These results support a putative role for ischemia-induced neurogenesis in what may be an adaptive or compensatory process, which is influenced by post-stroke stressors. This may contribute to the onset of Post-stroke depression (PSD) and thus represents a potential target for therapy."
"Activity-dependent changes in neuronal efficacy underlie the formation and storage of new memories. Several studies indicate that modification of the phosphorylation/activation state of different protein kinases localized in the synapses or the nucleus plays a critical role in the induction and maintenance of plastic mechanisms and in the consolidation of long-lasting memories. Here we review some of the more recent findings concerning the regulation of two of the main protein kinase groups involved in memory processes and in neuronal plasticity: Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. Since this issue of the journal is dedicated to serotonin (5HT) regulation of behavior, we will comment on the so far scanty, but significant, evidence for a role of 5HT in the regulation of CaMKII and MAPK."
"Although rejected for the most part of the 20th Century, the idea of brain plasticity began to receive wide acceptance from the 1970s. Yet there has been relatively little theoretical comment on the definition and use of ""plasticity"" in the field of neurobiology. An early exception to this lack of critical reflection on neural plasticity was provided by Jacques Paillard in a seminal paper that he published in 1976 [Paillard J. R&#xe9;flexions sur l'usage du concept de plasticit&#xe9; en neurobiology. J Psychol 1976;1:33-47]. As this valuable contribution was published in French, the present authors provide an English adaptation to help convey his ideas to an international audience, together with a contemporary commentary on this paper. Paillard's definition of the term ""plasticity"" is probably as pertinent today as it was 30 years ago, especially in terms of its relevance to multiple levels of analysis of brain function (molecular, cellular, systemic). Sadly, Jacques Paillard died in 2006; our comments therefore also include a brief biographical tribute to this outstanding neuroscientist."
"After having underlined the ambiguities of the concept of plasticity and the dangers of its purely metaphoric use in neurobiology, it is suggested that we return to a more precise definition of the structure, the operating principles and the function of the ""systemic"" unit or ""integron"" relevant to the particular level of analysis in question. Any change can then be described as a modification of function, a change in the operation principles, or an alteration of the material structure of the system. It is suggested that the term plastic should be restricted to describing, among the possible variations in the operating principles or the function of a given system, any lasting alteration of the connectivity network of the system under the influence of an external force or environmental constraint. Therefore, systematic or random variations of performance, functional flexibility or the vicarious(1) processes or strategies that can be found in a rigidly wired system are not justified examples of plasticity."
"Self-injurious behaviour (SIB) is exhibited by individuals with a broad variety of developmental disorders and genetic abnormalities, including autism and Lesch-Nyhan, Prader-Willi and Rett syndromes. Most research has focused on environmental factors that reinforce SIB, and less is known about the biological basis of this behaviour disorder. However, animal models have been developed to study the neurochemical pathology that underlies SIB. In one model, rats exhibit self-biting after repeated daily administration of moderately high doses of pemoline (100-200mg/kg). Dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission have been implicated in this model. Accordingly, we investigated the role of glutamatergic neurotransmission in pemoline-induced SIB, using the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists MK-801 and memantine. MK-801 is a high affinity antagonist which blocks glutamate-mediated neuroplasticity and behavioural sensitization to other psychostimulants. It lessened the incidence of SIB, the time spent self-injuring, and the area of tissue damage in the pemoline model. Memantine, on the other hand, is a low affinity antagonist which does not disrupt glutamate-mediated neuroplasticity, and it had little if any effect on any measure of pemoline-induced SIB. These results suggest that repeated pemoline administration induces glutamate-mediated neuroplastic changes that lead to the eventual expression of SIB. Further investigation of these changes may reveal specific neurochemical factors that contribute to SIB in this animal model of self-injury."
"The completion of the Human Genome Project and a variety of new technologies, such as DNA microarray technology, are revolutionizing the way molecular mechanisms underlying learning and memory can be explored. This review highlights the use of a genomic approach to dissect and analyze the complex dynamic interactions involved in gene regulation during learning and memory and illustrates the changes of serotonin receptor subtypes observed in different time domains and behavioral paradigms."
"Afferents from the perirhinal cortex (PRh) form a major input to the hippocampal formation, which is known to be involved in sexual behavior in rodents. But there is a lacuna in literature regarding the role of the PRh in sexual behavior. Bilateral neurotoxic lesions of the PRh delayed the ejaculation latency and prolonged the mean inter-intromission interval significantly, suggesting a facilitatory role of the PRh in male rat sex behavior."
Large amount of genetic information has been accumulated for zebrafish. Learning and memory have also been investigated with zebrafish but the number of learning paradigms is limited. Here we present a simple associative task and investigate a novel reinforcer. We show that visual access to a group of conspecifics has rewarding properties and that this reinforcer can support associative learning in zebrafish. We discuss the advantages of this rewarding stimulus and make recommendations for its use in high throughput behavioral screens.
"Many studies suggest that emotional arousal improves memory storage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of emotional content on explicit memory in untreated cephalalgic patients and in migraineurs treated with the antidepressant amitriptyline. We utilized an adaptation of two versions of the same story, with different arousing properties (neutral or emotional), which have been already employed in experiments involving the enhancing effects of emotions on memory retention. Subjects of the present study were healthy subjects and cephalalgic patients, suffering from migraine headache, which included untreated migraineurs and migraineurs treated with the antidepressant amitriptyline. The findings of our experiments suggest that chronic migraine is related to memory impairment. Taking into account that migraine is associated with major depression, in the present research the effect of the antidepressant amitriptyline was also evaluated. Our results showed that amitriptyline has an impairment effect on memory. In fact, the untreated migraineurs, compared to treated, recalled the most emotional phase of the arousal story significantly better. Then, our data suggest that amitriptyline prevents the enhancing effects of emotional content on memory processes. Moreover, in agreement with our previous data, this study suggests the existence of gender differences in the processing of emotional stimuli and underscores the importance of sex on emotional memory mechanisms."
"Since the discovery that certain flavonoids (namely flavones) specifically recognise the central BDZ receptors, several efforts have been made to identify naturally occurring GABA(A) receptor benzodiazepine binding site ligands. Flavonoid derivatives with a flavone-like structure such as apigenin, chrysin and wogonin have been reported for their anxiolytic-like activity in different animal models of anxiety. Luteolin (3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone) is a widespread flavonoid aglycon that was reported as devoid of specific affinity for benzodiazepine receptor (BDZ-R) binding site, but its psychopharmacological activity is presently unknown. Considering (1) the close structural similarity with other active flavones, (2) the activity of some of its glycosilated derivatives and (3) the complexity of flavonoid effects in the central nervous system, luteolin was submitted to a battery of tests designed to evaluate its possible activity upon the CNS and its ability to interact with the BDZ-receptor binding sites was also analysed. Luteolin apparently has CNS activity with anxiolytic-like effects despite the low affinity for the BDZ-R shown in vitro. Our findings suggest a possible interaction with other neurotransmitter systems but we cannot rule out the possibility that luteolin's metabolites might show a higher affinity for the BDZ-R in vivo, thus eliciting the evident anxiolytic-like effects through a GABAergic mechanism."
"The abundance of serotonin (5-HT) in the central nervous system can explain its role in the regulation of various functions, such as sleep, feeding, sexuality, emotional status, and pain. In addition, 5-HT localized in ""cognitive pathways"" with hippocampus and frontal cortex as the main target structures, is involved in learning and memory processes. Recent studies led to the discovery of various types and subtypes of receptors, differentially associated to cognitive mechanisms. Abundant data available reveals that the administration of 5-HT(2A/2C) and 5-H(T4) receptor agonists, or 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(3) and 5-HT(1B) antagonists improves memory and has a facilitatory effect on learning in situations involving a high cognitive demand. On the contrary 5-HT(2A/2C) and 5-HT(4) receptors antagonists, or 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(3) and 5-HT(1B) receptors agonists have opposite effects. Although these results are contradictory, or even opposite, it is important to take into account the effect of global, and unspecific, stimulation of serotonergic receptors and the activation of other neurotransmission systems, together with the type of task used, the way it is administered and the ligand affinity. The aim of this review is to clarify the behavioral role of the recently discovered 5-HT(7)-type receptor and highlight its involvement in the modulation of learning and memory processes, thus providing a basis to obtain new therapeutic agents and strategies for the treatment of learning and memory disorders."
"Lurcher mutant mice represent a model of olivocerebellar degeneration. Due to loss of Purkinje cells, they suffer from functional cerebellar decortication resulting in ataxia and deterioration of cognitive functions. The aim of the work was to assess the effect of enforced physical activity represented by rotarod training on motor skills and spatial learning in young and adult B6CBA Lurcher mice. These functions were compared with those in untrained wild type mice of the same age. We examined motor skills using bar, ladder and rotarod tests. Spatial learning was tested in the Morris water maze. Motor skills of Lurchers were found to be worse than in wild type mice, but they showed motor learning in the course of training. The training did not significantly influence the results on the bar and ladder. In the rotarod test, young trained Lurchers achieved only slightly better results than untrained ones. In adult mice, the improvement was insignificant. Lurchers failed in spatial learning test compared to the wild type mice. In the wild type mice there was no difference in learning between young and adult individuals, while young Lurchers learned better than older ones. Enforced motor activity led to spatial learning improvement in older Lurchers, but not in young ones. The experiments showed that effects of enforced physical activity in Lurcher mice mitigated the deficit in the water maze task related to age so that trained older Lurchers showed as good performance as younger ones but still worse than the wild type mice."
"No effective remedy has currently been realized to prevent the cognitive impairments of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The interruption of the toxic pathways of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) still remains promising for the treatment. The involvement of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the toxicity of Abeta(1-40) in recent reports provide a fresh target for the interruption. In the current study, we evaluated the feasibility of a strategy that target TNF-alpha to prevent the impairment of memory induced by Abeta. The i.c.v-injection of Abeta(25-35) increased the hippocampal mRNA expression of both TNF-alpha and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), of which the former was stronger. The knock-out of TNF-alpha (TNF-alpha (-/-)) in mouse prevented the increase of iNOS mRNA induced by Abeta(25-35). Not only the inhibition of iNOS activity but also TNF-alpha (-/-) prevented the nitration of proteins in the hippocampus and the impairment of recognition memory in mice induced by Abeta(25-35). Daily treatment with thalidomide (20 mg/kg), a preferential degrader of TNF-alpha mRNA, or i.c.v.-injection of an anti-TNF-alpha antibody (10 etag/mouse) prevented the nitration of proteins in the hippocampus and the impairment of recognition memory induced by Abeta(25-35) or Abeta(1-40) in mice. These results suggested the practicability of targeting TNF-alpha as a preventive strategy against Abeta-mediated cognitive impairments."
"Previous evidence from our laboratory has shown that histamine receptors located into the ventral hippocampus modulate learning and memory processes. Stimulation of histamine hippocampal sensitive receptors during the acquisition phase of a conditioned avoidance response to an ultrasonic tone was able to increase latency to escape and impair memory in the rat. Histamine application into the same hippocampal region also impaired the evocation of the response. The purpose of the present work was to evaluate if histaminergic neuron circuits have participation on the consolidation processes of the conditioned avoiding response. Male adult rats were implanted into the ventral hippocampus with microinjection cannulae and subjected consecutively to 2 sessions of 8 trials to learn an avoidance response after an ultrasonic tone of 40 kHz was on, as it was previously described. Immediately after the training period was over, or 15 min after, different groups of rats were microinjected with saline, histamine or a combination of histamine H(1)- or H(2)-receptor antagonists. Twenty four hours later, animals were tested in a new session for the retention of the avoiding response. Results showed that histamine treatment interfered with the consolidation of the avoiding response, affecting latency and the memory efficiency. This interference was mediated by histamine H(1)- and H(2)-receptors, since pretreatment with pyrilamine or ranitidine blocked the inhibitory effect of histamine. Results support the concept that histaminergic neurotransmission modulates learning and memory by affecting selectively the three stages of learning."
"(R)-(-)-1-(Benzofuran-2-yl)-2-propylaminopentane hydrochloride [(-)-BPAP] is a highly potent enhancer of impulse propagation-mediated monoamine release and an inhibitor of monoamine uptake. We evaluated the efficacy of (-)-BPAP as a drug for mood disorders by using two animal models. (1) Acute, but not chronic, administration of (-)-BPAP and imipramine significantly attenuated immobility in mice induced by forced swimming. Chronic, but not acute, administration of (-)-BPAP ameliorated the impairment of social interaction (SI) behavior following forced swimming, without affecting locomotor activity. The ameliorating effect of (-)-BPAP on the impairment of SI behavior was suppressed by dopamine receptor antagonists, which suggests that the effect was mediated through the activation of the dopaminergic system. Chronic administration of imipramine tended to attenuate the impairment of SI behavior in stressed mice, but not significantly. (2) In the olfactory bulbectomized (OB) rat, chronic (-)-BPAP treatment significantly ameliorated the impairment of SI behavior, prepulse inhibition, and tone-cue fear learning, without affecting locomotor activity in an open field and circadian activity pattern. Furthermore, (-)-BPAP tended to improve sexual dysfunction in OB rats, but imipramine had no such effect. These findings suggest that (-)-BPAP may be clinically effective in treating mood disorders, including comorbid anxiety and depression that are poorly responsive to imipramine."
"We here show that a neutral odor previously paired with a positive emotional context is an effective stimulus for attenuating the acoustic startle response (ASR) in rats. Olfactory cues can, therefore, be effectively used in the startle probe procedure for appetitive conditioning. This cue-induced reduction in ASR is not related to attentional alterations or a more general arousal by odor presentation, the conditioned olfactory cue rather elicits a pleasant emotional state during which the ASR is inhibited. This odor conditioned ""pleasure"" attenuation of the startle response might, therefore, provide a new effective operational measure for the hedonic aspects of reward."
"There is no reasonable doubt that the hippocampus plays an important role in memory processing. A virtually uncountable number of studies in animals and humans have revealed changes in neural activity in this structure during memory formation [Squire LR. Memory and the hippocampus: a synthesis from findings with rats, monkeys, and humans. Psychol Rev 1992;99:195-231; Squire LR, Stark CE, Clark RE. The medial temporal lobe. Annu Rev Neurosci 2004;27:279-306], and hippocampal damage reliably leads to impairments in a large number of memory tests. However, while several correlates of successful memory formation have been found in the hippocampus, it is still an open question why specific neural processes support encoding of a particular item. An answer to this question would help to resolve current debates about which memory functions are actually supported by the hippocampus, and why activity in the neural networks of the hippocampus is involved in, or even necessary for, some memory processes but not for others. In this review, we first summarize findings on the electrophysiological activity within the hippocampus during different memory processes. We try to differentiate whether the hippocampus is merely involved in these processes, or whether the hippocampus appears to be necessary for them. Based on a distinction between a more general ""encoding state"" and the more specific process of ""content-specific memory formation"", we review data on neural representations within hippocampus and neocortex. We suggest that during memory formation, the hippocampus renders neural representations more sparse by providing an inhibitory signal to the neocortex."
"We investigated sleep ontogenesis in the ferret-a placental mammal that is highly altricial compared to other mammalian species. Because altriciality is linked with elevated rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep amounts during infancy, it was expected that ferret kits would display very high levels of this state. Longitudinal polysomnographic measurements were made from 8 ferret kits from approximately eye-opening (postnatal day [P]30)-P50 using an experimental routine that minimized the effects of maternal separation. These data were compared to values from 8 adult ferrets (&gt;3 months of age) and 6 neonatal cats (mean age: P31.7). We find that the polygraphic features of REM and non-REM (NREM) sleep are present by at least P30. Over the next 2 weeks, REM sleep amounts slightly declined while wakefulness and NREM sleep amounts increased. However, a comparison to published values from developing cats and rats showed that the ferret did not exhibit a disproportionate amount of REM sleep at similar postnatal ages or relative to a common developmental milestone (eye-opening)."
"Misuse of anabolic-androgenic steroids (AASs) is increasing, and appears to have much in common with the use of substances known to induce drug dependence. Moreover, persons who abuse AASs also tend to abuse other psychotropic drugs such as amphetamine or 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy""). The aim of this study was to investigate whether nandrolone (5 x 5 or 5 x 20 mg/kg) pre-exposure modulates the acute neurochemical and behavioral effects of amphetamine (1mg/kg) and MDMA (5 mg/kg) in rats. Dopamine (DA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and their metabolites were measured from samples collected from the nucleus accumbens (NAc) by in vivo microdialysis. The behavior of the animals was recorded on videotapes, from which it was later rated. Our results demonstrate that sub-chronic treatments with supraphysiological doses of nandrolone attenuate dose-dependently the increase in extracellular DA concentration evoked by amphetamine or MDMA. The lower dose of nandrolone attenuated MDMA-induced increase in 5-HT-levels, while the higher dose potentiated it. Analysis of the behavioral data suggests that effects of the amphetamine and MDMA are dose-dependently attenuated by AAS-treatment, paralleling DA results. In conclusion, the results of this study show that AAS-pre-treatment is able to modulate the reward-related neurochemical and behavioral effects of amphetamine and MDMA."
"We determined if cutaneous hyperalgesia and pain-induced c-Fos overexpression in the spinal cord produced by repeated forced swimming (FS) stress in the rat were related to changes in GABA neurotransmission by studying spinal release of GABA and the effect of positive modulation of GABA-A receptors with diazepam. Male rats were daily submitted to 10-20 min of either forced swimming or sham swimming (SS) for 3 consecutive days. Two days later, spinal GABA release was estimated by in vivo microdialysis. In other set of rats, either diazepam (2 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline was administered 1h before either SS or FS and inflammatory nociception was assessed with the formalin test; it was followed by removal of lumbar spinal cords for c-Fos immunocytochemistry. Basal and pain-evoked release of GABA in the spinal cord was lower in FS rats than in SS rats. In contrast, pain scores during formalin test late phase and pain-induced c-Fos expression in laminae I-VI of ipsilateral dorsal horn were significantly higher in FS rats than in SS rats. In FS rats, diazepam did not have effect on GABA release but reduced pain scores and overexpression of c-Fos whereas flumazenil (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), an antagonist of the benzodiazepine binding site, reversed these effects. When diazepam was given only 1h before the formalin test, it slightly but significantly reduced pain scores during late phase in FS rats but not in SS rats. In conclusion, stress-induced reduction in GABA-A receptor activation is involved in the development of FS stress-induced hyperalgesia."
"This study examined the role of the read through variant of acetylcholinesterase (AChE-R) in lasting changes in murine affective behavior produced by a brief predator stress. AChE-R is elevated by stress in limbic cholinergic circuits implicated in anxiogenic effects of predator stress. The expression of AChE-R was blocked with a systemically administered central acting antisense oligonucleotide for AChE-R (EN101). EN101 was injected at multiple points prior to and after a predator stress in male C57 mice. Seven days after the last injection, behavior was tested. Predator stress caused a significant increase in startle amplitude, which EN101 blocked. This effect was specific to EN101, as the negative control inactive form of EN101, INVEN101 was without effect on stress effects on startle. Neither EN101 nor INVEN101 altered the anxiogenic effects of predator stress on behavior in the elevated plus maze, and both drugs partially reduced stress suppression of time active in the hole board. In the light dark box test, INVEN101 exhibited a weak block of stress effects on behavior for reasons which are unclear. Taken together, findings support the view that multiple neural systems are responsible for the different changes in behavior produced by predator stress. Present findings also suggest a role for AChE-R in specific anxiogenic (hyperarousal) effects following predator stress. Since AChE-R manipulations took place starting 23 h prior to predator stress and continued 48 h after predator stress, further research is necessary to determine the role of AChE-R in initiation and/or consolidation of hyperarousal effects of predator stress."
"The Tg2576 mouse model of excessive cerebral beta-amyloid deposition is now more than a decade old, yet consensus as to its exact characteristics and utility as a model of Alzheimer's disease is still lacking. Four different cohorts of control and Tg2576 mice, aged approximately 3, 9, 13 and 21 months, were therefore subjected to a battery of tests, principally to assess cognitive and species-typical behaviors. A novel test, the paddling Y-maze, demonstrated an age-dependent deficit in 10 and 14, but not 3 month Tg2576 mice, also in aged (21 month) control mice. However, in many other cognitive tests few Tg2576-related deficits could be shown. This frequently seemed attributable to poor performance of control mice. Tests of species-typical behaviors showed that Tg2576 mice had a deficit in burrowing behavior at all ages. An age-independent deficit was also seen in nest construction, but only when mice were group-housed; most individually housed mice in either group made reasonable nests. Overall, the results suggested that these Tg2576 mice are not a simple, suitable or reliable model for routine screening of treatments for Alzheimer's disease. However, this model might perform better behaviorally on a different genetic background."
"The processing of spatial information is the focus of interest for many cognitive neuroscientists. Approximately 10 years ago, a novel behavioral paradigm called active allothetic place avoidance (AAPA) was designed allowing the simultaneous assessment of locomotor and spatial behavior. The present study describes the effect of the combined treatment of Long-Evans rats with alpha1-adrenergic and D2 antagonists prazosin (1mg/kg and 2 mg/kg) and sulpiride (10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg) on locomotion and avoidance behavior in the AAPA task. Results show that co-application of both drugs leads to disturbances in locomotion and avoidance in rats at the doses, which caused no impairments when administered independently. This finding suggests that both types of receptors act synergistically to regulate locomotion and possibly spatial behavior."
"The plasticity of the nervous system is illustrated in the many new neuronal connections that are formed during the acquisition of behavioral skills, loss of function after brain injury, and subsequent recovery of function. The present review describes the acquisition of skilled reaching, the act of reaching for food with a forelimb, and the changes that take place in skilled reaching following motor cortex stroke. The review then discusses the difficulty in associating plastic changes with specific aspects of behavioral change. Skilled reaching behavior is complex and consists of a number of oppositions (stimulus response relationships), between the rat and the food target, a number of forelimb gestures (non-weight supporting movements), which are performed to obtain food, and a complex series of segmental movements (of the limb, head, and trunk), all of which influence the success of the act. Measures of these four aspects of skilled reaching behavior following motor cortex stroke reveal that there are a number of learned changes that take place at different times, including learned nonuse, learned bad-use, and forgetting. The widespread dendritic proliferation, axonal growth, and synaptic formation that take place both before and after stroke are difficult to precisely relate to these behavioral changes. Whereas plasticity is usually proposed to be associated with improved performance it is suggested that future work should attempt to better relate plastic changes to the details of behavioral changes."
"In ischemic preconditioning, prior exposure to a short 3-min global ischemia provides substantial protection against the deleterious effects of a subsequent prolonged ischemic insult in rats. The objective of the present study was to determine if the neuronal protection induced by ischemic preconditioning influence functional recovery following a 6-min ischemic insult in rats. Animals received either sham-operation, a 3-min ischemia, a preconditioning 3-min global ischemia followed 3 days later by a 6-min global ischemia or a single 6-min global ischemia. Open field habituation, memory performance in the 8-arm radial maze and object recognition were assessed at different intervals following ischemia. Our findings revealed that preconditioning reversed ischemia-induced spatial memory deficits in the 8-arm radial maze, as suggested by significant reduction of working memory errors in preconditioned as compared to ischemic animals. Preconditioning also attenuated ischemia-induced object recognition deficits at short-term intervals. Nonetheless, preconditioning failed to alter ischemia-induced hyperactivity as demonstrated by enhanced behavioral activity in the open field in both preconditioned and ischemic animals compared to 3-min ischemic and sham-operated rats. CA1 cell counts revealed significant neuronal sparing in preconditioned animals that was observed 6-month following reperfusion. Together, these findings suggest that neuronal survival in preconditioned rats is associated with significant improvements of hippocampal-dependent memory functions and, further support that ischemia-induced hyperactivity may not solely depend on selective neuronal damage to hippocampal neurons."
"The canonical Wnt pathway and beta-catenin have been implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. We generated forebrain-specific CRE-mediated conditional beta-catenin knock-out mice to begin exploring the behavioral implications of decreased Wnt pathway signaling in the central nervous system. In situ hybridization revealed a progressive knock-out of beta-catenin that began between 2 and 4 weeks of age, and by 12 weeks resulted in considerably decreased beta-catenin expression in regions of the forebrain, including the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. A significant decrease in protein levels of beta-catenin in these brain regions was observed by Western blot. Behavioral characterization of these mice in several tests (including the forced swim test, tail suspension test (TST), learned helplessness, response and sensitization to stimulants, and light/dark box among other tests) revealed relatively circumscribed alterations. In the TST, knock-out mice spent significantly less time struggling (a depression-like phenotype). However, knock-out mice did not differ from their wild-type littermates in the other behavioral tests of mood-related or anxiety-related behaviors. These results suggest that a 60-70% beta-catenin reduction in circumscribed brain regions is only capable of inducing subtle behavioral changes. Alternatively, regulating beta-catenin may modulate drug effects rather than being a model of mood disorder pathophysiology per se."
"A major neuroendocrinological effect of calorie restriction (CR) is induction of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). Aside from its appetite-stimulating effects, NPY is thought to be involved in the modulation of behavioral processes including anxiety and learning and memory. In the present study physical fitness, anxiety, and learning/memory-related tasks were assessed in mice lacking NPY or a functional ARC after dietary manipulation by CR. Physical fitness was improved by CR when measured by inclined screen and rotarod, and this diet effect was not affected by NPY or ARC status. As has been observed previously, the NPY knockout mice displayed heightened anxiety in an open field. This phenotype was not fully recapitulated in the ARC-lesioned model. CR affected neither total locomotor activity in the open field nor thigmotaxic behavior in these models. Neither NPY nor CR had a significant effect on Morris water maze performance; however, ARC-damaged mice were unable to learn the task, and this deficit was not corrected by CR. We conclude that despite established effects of CR on ARC signaling, our results suggest a mechanistic separation between the two where behavior is concerned."
"Gene linkage and association studies have implicated the region of chromosome 10q containing the calcyon locus with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia susceptibility. In addition, levels of calcyon protein and transcripts are also significantly increased in postmortem tissue from schizophrenic brains. But whether altered calcyon expression might be part of the disease etiology or merely a patho-physiological side effect is not known. To begin to address this issue, we generated a transgenic mouse line (Cal(OE)) using the human calcyon cDNA in which calcyon expression is up-regulated in a number of forebrain structures including the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), striatum, and amygdala. Compared to control littermates, the Cal(OE) mice display a range of abnormal behaviors including spontaneous hyperactivity, reduced anxiety, and/or impaired restraint (harm avoidance) that would indicate that calcyon up-regulation leads to deficits in control over behavioral output."
"Exposure to an intermittent, escalating dose of amphetamine induces a sensitized state that, both behaviourally and neurochemically, mirrors several features linked to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Increasingly it is being realized that cognitive deficits are a core component of schizophrenia; therefore we sought to assess the effects of inducing an amphetamine-sensitized state on memory (working and long-term) and cognitive flexibility, two cognitive domains impaired in schizophrenia. Rats were exposed to a sensitizing regimen of amphetamine (1-5 mg/kg; three times per week for 5 weeks; escalating at 1mg/kg per week) or saline. In experiment 1, animals were tested on an operant delayed non-match to position task (working memory). Experiment 2 used a standard fixed-platform location water maze task (long-term memory), while experiment 3 used a variable-platform location water maze task (long-term memory and working memory). Amphetamine-sensitized animals were not impaired on any of these tasks. In experiment 4, animals were assessed on a strategy selection task in which they were first required to learn to locate a food reward using a particular learning strategy (place or response) then to learn to shift to an alternate learning strategy (response or place). Amphetamine-sensitized animals were not impaired on this task. In the final experiment animals were found to be impaired in performance of the extra-dimensional shift component of an attentional set-shifting task. These results suggest that while amphetamine sensitization does not produce memory impairments similar to those seen in schizophrenia, it does produce strong impairments in set-shifting, suggesting changes in prefrontal function similar to those seen in schizophrenia."
"Restricted, repetitive behaviours (e.g., stereotypies, compulsions, rituals) in neurodevelopmental disorders have been linked to alterations in cortico-basal ganglia circuitry. Cognitive processes mediated by this circuitry (e.g., procedural learning, executive function) are likely to be impaired in individuals exhibiting high rates of repetitive behaviour. To test this hypothesis, we assessed both procedural learning and cognitive flexibility (reversal learning) using a T-maze task in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) exhibiting various rates of repetitive behaviour (vertical jumping and backward somersaulting). These mice exhibited high rates of stereotypy when reared in standard rodent cages, and such behaviour was significantly attenuated by housing them in larger more complex environments. Mice reared in complex environments exhibited significantly better procedural and reversal learning than standard caged mice. Thus, early experience associated with the prevention and attenuation of stereotypy was associated with better striatally mediated learning and cognitive flexibility. Stereotypy score was significantly correlated with the number of errors made in reversal learning, and interacted with housing condition to affect overall cognitive performance. Our findings support the applicability of the deer mouse model of spontaneous stereotypy to a wider range of restricted, repetitive behaviour (e.g., insistence on sameness) typical of neurodevelopmental disorders."
"Subregional analyses of the hippocampus suggest CA1-dependent memory processes rely heavily upon interactions between the CA1 subregion and entorhinal cortex. There is evidence that the direct perforant path (pp) projection to CA1 is selectively modulated by dopamine while having little to no effect on the Schaffer collateral (SC) projection to CA1. The current study takes advantage of this pharmacological dissociation to demonstrate that local infusion of the non-selective dopamine agonist, apomorphine (10, 15 microg), into the CA1 subregion of awake animals produces impairments in working memory at intermediate (5 min), but not short-term (10 s) delays within a delayed non-match-to-place task on a radial arm maze. Sustained impairments were also found in a novel context with similar object-space relationships. Infusion of apomorphine into CA1 is also shown here to produce deficits in spatial, but not non-spatial novelty detection within an object exploration paradigm. In contrast, apomorphine produces no behavioral deficits when infused into the CA3 subregion or overlying cortex. These behavioral studies are supported by previous electrophysiological data that demonstrate local infusion of the same doses of apomorphine significantly modifies evoked responses in the distal dendrites of CA1 following angular bundle stimulation, but produces no significant effects in the proximal dendritic layer following stimulation of the SC. These results support a modulatory role for dopamine in EC-CA1, but not CA3-CA1 circuitry, and suggest the possibility of a fundamental role for EC-CA1 synaptic transmission in terms of detection of spatial novelty, and intermediate-term, but not short-term spatial working memory or object-novelty detection."
"The locus coeruleus (LC) located at the level of the pons, is involved in cognitive functions such as learning and memory. The bilateral lidocaine-induced reversible inactivation of this nucleus has been considered in order to study its role in the phases of memory processing (acquisition, consolidation and retention) without any interference with the function of the same structure either during earlier and/or later phases of the same process. In this study, inhibitory avoidance (IA) learning task used to find the LC function in acquisition, consolidation and retrieval. Saline or lidocaine 4% (0.5 microl/side) microinjected into the LC, for assessing the acquisition (5 min before training), consolidation (5, 90 and 360 min after training) and memory retrieval, 5 min before testing. The retention test was done 24h after learning. Our results indicated that: (1) The bilateral functional inactivation of LC before training did not affect acquisition, but affected subsequent memory retention 24h later in IA task. (2) The lidocaine-induced inactivation of LC only 5 min after training impaired consolidation but did not affect it after 90 or 360 min. (3) Inactivation of the LC, 5 min before pre-retrieval test, impaired memory retrieval in IA task. In conclusion, it seems that the nucleus locus coeruleus does not affect acquisition while it involves in the memory consolidation and retrieval of inhibitory avoidance learning task."
"When rats are intraorally exposed to saccharin solution that has previously been paired with lithium chloride (LiCl), they display Pavlovian conditioned disgust reactions. When exposed to LiCl-paired saccharin solution by bottle, they display suppressed instrumental approach to the bottle resulting in suppressed consumption. The present experiments demonstrated that while neither neurotoxin-induced lesions of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) nor the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) attenuated the display of Pavlovian conditioned disgust reactions, lesions of the BLA (but not the CeA) attenuated instrumental conditioned avoidance of the taste. The results are discussed in light of current models of the role of the amygdala in aversive learning."
"Sleep is a prominent behaviour in the lives of animals, but the unresponsiveness that characterizes sleep makes it dangerous. Mammalian sleep is composed of two neurophysiological states: slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Given that the intensity of stimuli required to induce an arousal to wakefulness is highest during deep SWS or REM sleep, mammals may be most vulnerable during these states. If true, then animals should selectively reduce deep SWS and REM sleep following an increase in the risk of predation. To test this prediction, we simulated a predatory encounter with 10 wild-caught Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), which are perhaps more likely to exhibit natural anti-predator responses than laboratory strains. Immediately following the encounter, rats spent more time awake and less time in SWS and REM sleep. The reduction of SWS was due to the shorter duration of SWS episodes, whereas the reduction of REM sleep was due to a lower number of REM sleep episodes. The onset of SWS and REM sleep was delayed post-encounter by about 20 and 100 min, respectively. The reduction of REM sleep was disproportionately large during the first quarter of the sleep phase, and slow wave activity (SWA) (0.5-4.5 Hz power density) was lower during the first 10 min of SWS post-encounter. An increase in SWA and REM sleep was observed later in the sleep phase, which may reflect sleep homeostasis. These results suggest that aspects of sleep architecture can be adjusted to the prevailing risk of predation."
"Hypobaric hypoxia (HH), a predisposing environmental condition at high altitude (HA) encountered by many mountaineers jeopardizes their normal physiology like motor coordination and cognitive functions. Our previous studies revealed that the HH induces oxidative stress and neurodegeneration, which is associated with spatial memory impairment in rats. However, the dendritic changes after exposure to different duration of HH remain largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the duration-dependent dendritic changes in CA1, CA3 and entorhinal cortex (EC) of hippocampus and layer II of prefrontal cortex (PFC) with spatial memory functions in rats on exposure to different duration of HH. The rats were exposed to simulated HA of 6100 m for 3, 7, 14 and 21 days and the spatial reference memory was investigated using Morris water maze (MWM) and the morphological alteration of CA1, CA3, EC and layer II of PFC were investigated. There was a significant decrease in dendritic arborization and spine number along with increased number of damaged neurons, after 3, 7 and 14 days of HH but after 21 days of HH exposure the structural recovery was noted in all the regions. There was impairment of spatial memory after 3 and 7 days of exposure, but slight improvement of spatial memory was noted after 14 and 21 days of exposure. Our studies suggested that HH induces dendritic plasticity of PFC and hippocampal pyramidal neurons of rat brain, which might be associated with improvement of spatial memory function after 21 days of HH exposure."
"Arylsulfatase A (ASA)-deficient mice represent an animal model for the lysosomal storage disorder metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). Although the model has been applied in pathophysiological and therapeutic studies, the behavioural phenotype of ASA(-/-) mice is only partially characterized, and the most decisive outcome measures for therapy evaluation only emerge beyond 1 year of age. Presently, ASA(-/-) mice and ASA(+/-) control mice were studied at 6 and 12 months of age on an extensive battery including tests of neuromotor ability, exploratory behaviour, and learning and memory. Overt signs of ataxia were not observed in 6-month-old ASA(-/-) mice, but quantitative gait analysis during open-field exploration revealed that ASA(-/-) mice displayed increased hind base width and increased stride lengths for all paws. Their covert motor incoordination was evident in a correlation analysis which unveiled decreased harmonisation of concurrent gait parameters. For example, while ASA(+/-) controls demonstrated substantial convergence of front and hind base width (r=0.54), these variables actually diverged in ASA(-/-) mice (r=-0.37). Furthermore, various behavioural observations indicated emotional alterations in ASA(-/-) mice. Six-month-old ASA(-/-) mice also showed decreased response rates in scheduled operant responding. The present findings could provide relevant behavioural outcome measures for further use of this murine MLD model in preclinical studies."
"Functional and structural plasticity is a fundamental property of the brain involved in diverse processes ranging from brain construction and repair to storage of experiences during lifetime. Our current understanding of different forms of brain plasticity mechanisms has advanced tremendously in the last decades, benefiting from studies of development and memory storage in adulthood and from investigations of diverse diseased conditions. In this review, we focus on the role of mental retardation (MR) genes and show how this developing area of research can enrich our knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of brain plasticity and cognitive functions, and of the dysfunctional mechanisms underlying MR. We describe two main groups of MR genes; those leading to dysfunctional neurodevelopmental programs and brain malformations, and those which rely on alterations in molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic organization and plasticity. We first explore the role of MR genes in key mechanisms of neurogenesis and neuronal migration during development and in the adult, such as actin and microtubule-cytoskeletal dynamics and signal transduction. We then define the contribution of MR genes to forms of activity-dependent synaptic modifications, such as those involved in molecular organization of the synapse, intracellular signaling regulating gene programs and neuronal cytoskeleton to control network remodeling. We trace the characteristics of MR genes playing key roles in many forms of brain plasticity mechanisms, and highlight specific MR genes that endorse distinct roles in different cell types or brain regions, and at various times of a brain lifetime."
"The role of RNA-binding proteins in the central nervous system and more specifically their role in motor coordination and learning are poorly understood. We previously reported that ablation of RNA-binding protein Sam68 in mice results in male sterility and delayed mammary gland development and protection against osteoporosis in females. Sam68 however is highly expressed in most regions of the brain especially the cerebellum and thus we investigated the cerebellar-related manifestations in Sam68-null mice. We analyzed the mice for motor function, sensory function, and learning and memory abilities. Herein, we report that Sam68-null mice have motor coordination defects as assessed by beam walking and rotorod performance. Forty-week-old Sam68-null mice (n=12) were compared to their wild-type littermates (n=12). The Sam68-null mice exhibited more hindpaw faults in beam walking tests and fell from the rotating drum at lower speeds and prematurely compared to the wild-type controls. The Sam68-null mice were, however, normal for forelimb strength, tail-hang reflex, balance test, grid walking, the Morris water task, recognition memory, visual discrimination, auditory stimulation and conditional taste aversion. Our findings support a role for Sam68 in the central nervous system in the regulation of motor coordination."
"Pre-training administration of p-chloroamphetamine (PCA) produces reliable deficits of avoidance learning. When animals are trained in inhibitory avoidance with relatively high foot-shock intensities, other amnesic treatments have no effect. The present experiment was conducted to determine if this protective effect of high foot shock is also observed after administration of PCA (10mg/kg, i.p., injected 7 days before training; this dose produces a lesion of central serotonin neurons). Rats were trained in active avoidance (a single 20-trial session), administering shocks of 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, or 1.4 mA to independent groups of rats. When compared to saline-injected groups trained with the same intensities, PCA produced a significant learning deficit in the low foot-shock groups, but not in the high foot-shock animals. These results indicate that the dose of PCA administered, which is known to deplete cerebral serotonin, does not interfere with acquisition and retention of enhanced active avoidance training."
"Although the repercussion of chronic treatment with large amounts of opioids on cognitive performance is a matter of concern, the effects of opioid drugs on passive avoidance learning have been scarcely studied. Here, we analyzed the effects of prolonged administration of heroin and methadone, as well as the impact of suffering repeated episodes of withdrawal on fear-motivated learning using the passive avoidance test. Mice received chronic treatment (39 days) with methadone (10 mg/kg/24 h), associated or not with repeated withdrawal episodes, or with heroin (5 mg/kg/12 h). Our results show that, regardless of the type of treatment received, all mice displayed similar basal thermal nociceptive thresholds during 25 days of treatment. In the hot plate test, both methadone and heroin induced antinociception 30 min after drug administration. The analgesic effect was absent when measured 4 h after heroin and 12 h after methadone. Pain behavioural responses elicited by growing intensities of electric shock, applied on day 28th of treatment, were similar in all groups of mice. Our results indicate that chronic opioid treatment had promnesic effects on passive avoidance behaviour in mice, unrelated to changes in the nociceptive state."
"The present study evaluated the effects of intermittent hypoxia (IH) and sleep restriction (SR) upon motor and cognitive function in rats. Also evaluated were catecholamine concentrations and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein expression in different regions of the forebrain. Wistar Hannover rats were submitted to IH for 4 days or 21 days (2 min room air to 2 min 10% O(2) for 10:00-16:00 h), followed by SR for 18 h (16:00-10:00 h). Rats were randomly assigned into four experimental groups: (1) control (2) IH (3) SR and (4) IH-SR. In the inhibitory avoidance task, an additional group of rats was submitted to paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) for 96 consecutive hours. Results showed that SR induced an increase in motor activity without modifying catecholaminergic turnover in the frontal cortex and striatum. The increase in exploratory activity in SR rats could be the result of impaired habituation. Neither SR periods induced cognitive deficits in the inhibitory avoidance task after 5 or 21 days. However, 96 h of PSD impaired acquisition/retention in rats. Exposure to IH did not affect motor and cognitive function but IH was associated with SR in increased motor activity. After 21 days, IH and IH-SR reduced striatal norepinephrine concentration although neither SR nor IH affected TH protein expression. The results presented here suggest that hypoxia and sleep loss exert distinct deleterious effects upon the central nervous system."
"Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and oxidative stress in brain have been suggested to play an important role in the regulation of memory functions. Therefore, the present study was planned to study the effect of donepezil, an anticholinesterase antidementia drug, insulin and melatonin, an antioxidant, on memory deficit and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in brain areas of scopolamine-induced amnesic mice. Memory was tested by passive avoidance (PA) test in Swiss adult male mice. A significant increase in transfer latency time (TLT) in 2nd trial as compared to 1st trial is considered as successful learning. Scopolamine (3 mg/kg i.p.) was administered 5 min prior to 1st trial to induce amnesia. AChE activity in detergent soluble (DS) and salt soluble (SS) fractions was estimated in brain areas after completion of 2nd trial. Scopolamine was effective in producing memory impairment (amnesia) which was reverted by donepezil (5 mg/kg p.o.), insulin (1 IU/kg i.p.) and melatonin (20 mg/kg p.o.). AChE activity in DS fraction of scopolamine amnesic mice was inhibited by donepezil, insulin and melatonin with varying extent in different brain regions, whereas AChE activity in SS fraction was not much affected. The results demonstrate that anti-amnesic effect of donepezil, insulin and melatonin may be mediated through enhancement of cholinergic activity."
This study investigated the effect of maternal pinealectomy and postnatal pinealectomy on affective responses. Siberian hamsters were born to either pinealectomized or sham-operated dams and then underwent pinealectomy or a sham operation. Maternal pinealectomy increased depressive-like responses of offspring in the forced swim test. Maternal pinealectomy increased rearing behaviour and postnatal pinealectomy increased locomotor behaviour in the open field test. These results suggest that prenatal melatonin organizes adult affective responses.
"While mutations in the Park-2 gene are the most frequent cause of autosomal-recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP), they are also present in several forms of tauopathies. Conversely, in some forms of parkinsonism, mutations in the tau gene have also been observed. Deletion of the Park-2 gene and over-expression of mutant tau independently produce mild brain alterations in mice. However, the presence of both mutations simultaneously causes a tau neuropathology, involving reactive astrocytosis, neuron loss in the cortex and hippocampus, and lesions in nigrostriatal and motor neurons. Furthermore, mutant tau over-expression in mice produces important memory impairment. When ""parkin"" function was abolished in young tau transgenic mice, the memory alterations were exaggerated. Moreover, additional exploratory and motor deficits were observed in older mice, causing the memory alterations to be underestimated. Thus, while memory deficits are more severe in young mice they were somehow attenuated by exploratory impairments in ageing mutants. This double mutant animal will serve as a useful experimental tool to investigate the abnormal processing of hyperphosphorylated tau and its relationship to the development of the cognitive deficits associated with certain neurodegenerative diseases."
"The L-arginine/nitric oxide (NO) pathways are widely distributed in the central nervous system (CNS) and have been implicated in the modulation of anxiety. The elevated plus-maze (ETM) is an animal test pharmacologically validated for the study of experimental anxiety in rats, designed to evaluate inhibitory avoidance (AVOID) learning and one-way escape (ESC) from open arms, thought to represent learned (conditioned) and innate (unconditioned) fear, respectively. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of prior treatment with the NO-synthase inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) on both AVOID and ESC behavior of rats in the ETM, when applied to different cerebral regions associated with defensive behaviors. Central treatment with L-NAME (50, 100, 400 and 800 nmol) did not impair the AVOID response through the trials and had no effect on the ESC behavior. Nevertheless, animals treated with L-NAME at 200 nmol into the lateral ventricle (LV), basolateral amygdala (BLA), dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG) matter, lateral septal nucleus (LSN), but not in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST), displayed impaired AVOID2 in comparison to the control group. Thus, our results suggest that NO may underlie learned fear in the ETM via BLA, dlPAG and LSN, but not BNST. These results are compatible with the proposal that NO exerts a positive modulatory role on defensive reactions in rats, exerting among them an anxiogenic-like effect as evaluated in rats submitted to ETM."
"Through recording of saccadic eye movements, we investigated whether humans can achieve prediction of aperiodic target sequences which cannot be predicted based solely on memorizing short-length patterns of the target sequence. We proposed a novel experimental paradigm in which Auto-Regressive (AR) processes are used to generate aperiodic target sequences. If subjects can fully utilize the knowledge on the AR dynamics that have generated the target sequence, optimal prediction can be made. As a control task, a completely unpredictable (random) target sequence was generated by shuffling the AR sequences. Behavioral analysis suggested that the prediction of the next target position in the AR sequence was significantly more successful than that by the random guess or the optimal guess for the random sequence. Although their performances were not optimal, learning of the AR dynamics was observed for first-order AR sequences, suggesting that the subjects attempted to predict the next target position based on partially identified AR dynamics."
"A range of transgenic and knock-in mouse models of Huntington's disease have been created since identification in 1993 of the disease mutation in the HD gene. Knock-in models that express the full-length mutant protein tend to exhibit less severe behavioural deficits than transgenic models and so require more sensitive tasks in order to reveal impairments. To achieve this, we therefore used a Serial Implicit Learning Task (SILT), which measures serial reaction times to visual stimuli, requiring detection and responding in both predictable and unpredictable locations in the 9-hole operant chamber. We have previously reported that knock-in Hdh(Q92/Q92) mice exhibit a modest impairment in learning the SILT tasks at 4 months of age, prior to the formation of overt neuronal nuclear inclusions. In the present study we have explored the time course of the development of impairments from 5 to 14 months of age. The deficit previously found in accuracy and reaction time was present at all ages examined in these Hdh(Q92/Q92) mice; the deficit was not progressive, and did not correlate with the evolution of neuronal nuclear inclusions."
"The epigenetic marking of chromatin provides a ubiquitous means for cells to shape and maintain their identity, and to react to environmental stimuli via specific remodeling. Such an epigenetic code of the core components of chromatin, DNA and histone proteins, can thus be stable but is also highly dynamic. In the nervous system, epigenetic codes are critical for basic cellular processes such as synaptic plasticity, and for complex behaviours such as learning and memory. At the same time, epigenetic marks can be stably transmitted through mitosis and meiosis, and thereby underlie non-genomic transgenerational inheritance of behavioural traits. In this review, we describe recent findings on the role and mechanisms of epigenetic codes in the brain, and discuss their implication in synaptic plasticity, cognitive functions and psychiatric disorders. We provide examples of transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic marks that affect simple morphological traits or complex processes such as disease susceptibility, and point to the potential implication of epigenetic codes in medicine and evolution."
"The neurotransmitter acetylcholine is an important modulator of cognitive functions including attention, learning, and memory. The actions of acetylcholine are mediated by five distinct muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes (M(1)-M(5)). The lack of drugs with a high degree of selectivity for these subtypes has impeded the determination of which subtypes mediate which components of cholinergic neurotransmission relevant to cognitive abilities. The present study examined the behavioral functions of the M(2) muscarinic receptor subtype by utilizing congenic C57BL/6 mice possessing a null-mutation in the M(2) muscarinic receptor gene (M(2)(-/-) mice). Comprehensive assessment of general health and the neurological function found no major differences between M(2)(-/-) and wild-type (M(2)(+/+)) mice. In the tests of learning and memory, M(2)(-/-) mice were impaired in the acquisition (trials to criterion), but not the retention (72h) of a passive avoidance task. In a novel open field, M(2)(-/-) mice were impaired in between-sessions, but not within-session habituation. In a holeboard test of spatial memory, M(2)(-/-) mice committed more errors in working memory than M(2)(+/+) mice. Reference memory did not differ between the genotypes. M(2)(-/-) mice showed no impairments in either cued or contextual fear conditioning. These findings replicate and extend earlier findings in a hybrid strain and solidify the interpretation that the M(2) receptor plays a critical role in specific components of cognitive abilities."
"Systemic administration of dopamine D1 (SCH23390) and less so D2 (raclopride) receptor antagonists significantly reduce acquisition and expression of fructose-conditioned flavor preferences (CFP). Because dopamine in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcS) is implicated in food reward, the present study examined whether NAcS D1 or D2 antagonists altered acquisition and/or expression of fructose-CFP. In Experiment 1, food-restricted rats with bilateral NAcS cannulae were trained to drink a fructose (8%)+saccharin (0.2%) solution mixed with one flavor (CS+/Fs) and a less-preferred 0.2% saccharin solution with mixed another flavor (CS-/s). Unlimited two-bottle tests with the two flavors in saccharin (0.2%: CS+/s, CS-/s) occurred 10 min following total bilateral NAcS doses of 0, 12, 24 or 48 nmol of SCH23390 or raclopride. Preference for CS+/s over CS-/s following vehicle treatment (76%) was significantly reduced by SCH23390 (48 nmol, 62%) and raclopride (24 nmol, 63%). In Experiment 2, rats received bilateral NAcS injections (12 nmol) of SCH23390 or raclopride on one-bottle training (16 ml) days. Yoked control rats received vehicle and were limited to the CS intakes of the D1 and D2 groups, whereas untreated controls without injections received their CS ration during training. Subsequent unlimited two-bottle tests revealed initial preferences of CS+/s over CS-/s in all groups that remained stable in untreated and yoked controls, but were lost over the six tests sessions in D1 and D2 groups. These data indicate that NAcS D1 and D2 antagonists significantly attenuated the expression of the fructose-CFP and did not block acquisition, but hastened extinction of fructose-CFP."
"We previously reported that males undergoing chronic social stress (SS) (daily 1h isolation and new cage partner on days 30-45 of age) in adolescence habituated (decreased corticosterone release) to the homotypic stressor, but females did not. Here, we report that adolescent males exposed to chronic social stress had potentiated corticosterone release to a heterotypic stressor (15 min of swim stress) compared to acutely stressed and control males. The three groups of males did not differ in depressive-like behaviour (time spent immobile) during the swim stress. Corticosterone release in socially stressed females was elevated 45 min after the swim stress compared to acutely stressed and control females, and socially stressed females exhibited more depressive behaviour (longer durations of immobility and shorter durations of climbing) than the other females during the swim stress. Separate groups of rats were tested as adults several weeks after the social stress, and there were no group differences in corticosterone release after the swim stress. The only group difference in behaviour among the adults was more time spent climbing in socially stressed males than in controls. Thus, there are sex-specific effects of social stress in adolescence on endocrine responses and depressive behaviour to a heterotypic stressor, but, unlike for anxiety, substantial recovery is evident in adulthood in the absence of intervening stress exposures."
"Several studies on both humans and animals reveal benefits of physical exercise on brain function and health. A previous study on TgCRND8 mice, a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease, reported beneficial effects of premorbid onset of long-term access to a running wheel on spatial learning and plaque deposition. Our study investigated the effects of access to a running wheel after the onset of Abeta pathology on behavioural, endocrinological, and neuropathological parameters. From day 80 of age, the time when Abeta deposition becomes apparent, TgCRND8 and wildtype mice were kept with or without running wheel. Home cage behaviour was analysed and cognitive abilities regarding object recognition memory and spatial learning in the Barnes maze were assessed. Our results show that, in comparison to Wt mice, Tg mice were characterised by impaired object recognition memory and spatial learning, increased glucocorticoid levels, hyperactivity in the home cage and high levels of stereotypic behaviour. Access to a running wheel had no effects on cognitive or neuropathological parameters, but reduced the amount of stereotypic behaviour in transgenics significantly. Furthermore, wheel-running was inversely correlated with stereotypic behaviour, suggesting that wheel-running may have stereotypic qualities. In addition, wheel-running positively correlated with plaque burden. Thus, in a phase when plaques are already present in the brain, it may be symptomatic of brain pathology, rather than protective. Whether or not access to a running wheel has beneficial effects on Alzheimer-like pathology and symptoms may therefore strongly depend on the exact time when the wheel is provided during development of the disease."
"Vigilance levels of 12 morning types (M-types) and 12 evening types (E-types) were investigated after a baseline night, 2 nights of sleep fragmentation (5 min of forced awakening every half-hour) and a recovery night. Sleep timing was adjusted to the preferred sleep schedule of each subject. Daytime vigilance levels were assessed with test series including a scale of subjective alertness, a psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), a waking EEG recording, and a sleep latency test. Test series were administered every 4h, beginning 1.5h after wake time. On the baseline day, significant diurnal variations were found for each vigilance measure, except for the PVT. Diurnal variations were similar in M-types and E-types. Sleep fragmentation decreased vigilance levels on each measure, except the PVT. Effects of sleep fragmentation and recovery were similar in the two chronotypes. These results highlight the similarities in diurnal variations of vigilance in the two chronotypes when studied at their preferred sleep schedule. Results were also compared between chronotypes with extremely early or late circadian phases (""Extreme"" subgroup) and between those with similar, intermediate circadian phases (""Intermediate"" subgroup). Diurnal variations of subjective alertness and sleep latencies differed between ""Extreme"" chronotypes but were identical between ""Intermediate"" chronotypes. There were no major differences in the response to sleep fragmentation in any subgroup. Since phase angles differed by the same amount between chronotypes within each subgroup, the results suggest that a difference in phase angle cannot be the only source of the differences observed in diurnal variations between ""Extreme"" chronotypes."
"The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of the rat plays an essential role in behavioral flexibility, as lesions or inactivations of this region impair shifting between strategies or attentional sets using a variety of different behavioral tests. In the present study, we assessed the effects of inactivation of the mPFC on strategy set-shifting and reversal learning, using a novel, automated procedure conducted in an operant chamber. In Experiment 1, inactivation of the mPFC with bupivacaine did not impair the initial learning of a visual-cue (i.e.; always press the lever with a cue light illuminated above it) or a response (i.e.; always press the left lever) discrimination. Control rats required greater number of trials to shift from using a visual-cue to a response strategy than the opposite shift. mPFC inactivation impaired performance of a visual-cue-response set-shift, but not the easier response-visual-cue shift. In Experiment 2, pre-exposure to the visual-cue stimulus lights increased the difficulty of the response-visual-cue shift, reflected by a greater number of trials required by control rats to achieve criterion relative to those in Experiment 1. Under these conditions, inactivation of the mPFC did impair performance of this set-shift. In contrast, mPFC inactivation did not affect reversal learning of a response discrimination. These findings highlight the utility of this automated procedure for assessing set-shifting mediated by the mPFC. Furthermore, they reveal that the relative difficulty of the type of shift rats are required to perform has a direct impact on whether or not the mPFC contributes to this form of behavioral flexibility."
"Olfaction is a major sensory element in intraspecies recognition and communication in mice. The present study investigated scent marking behaviors of males of the highly inbred C57BL/6J (C57) strain in order to evaluate the ability of these behaviors to provide clear and consistent measures of social familiarity and response to social signals. C57 males engage in scent marking when placed in a chamber with a wire mesh partition separating them from a conspecific. Male mice (C57 or outbred CD-1 mice) showed rapid habituation of scent marking (decreased marking over trials) with repeated exposure at 24-h intervals, to a stimulus animal of the C57 or CD-1 strains, or to an empty chamber. Subsequent exposure to a genetically different novel mouse (CD-1 after CD-1 exposure, or CD-1 after C57 exposure) or to a novel context (different shaped chamber) produced recovery of marking, while responses to a novel but genetically identical mouse (C57 after C57 exposure) or to the empty chamber did not. This finding demonstrated that male mice differentiate familiar and novel conspecifics as expressed by habituation and recovery of scent marking, but neither C57 or CD-1 mice can differentiate new vs. familiar C57 males; likely due to similarities in their odor patterns. The data also indicate that scent marking can differentiate novel from familiar contexts."
"The present study aimed to examine the effects of an acute administration of the mu-opioid receptor fentanyl on affect as assessed by place-conditioning procedure in rats. We determined the affective properties of fentanyl not only immediately following its administration, but also 24h later. Experiments were performed using the dose of fentanyl (240 gamma/kg; four injections of 60 gamma/(ml kg) every 15 min, subcutaneously) for which secondary hyperalgesia has been previously described. Our results show that the acute administration of fentanyl display biphasic affective properties, with early rewarding and 24-h delayed aversive components. The 24-h delayed aversive effects of fentanyl were not observed in animals submitted to a polyamine-deficient diet, suggesting an NMDA-dependent mechanism."
"It is known that animals decerebrated at the premammillary level are capable of standing and walking without losing balance, in contrast to postmammillary ones which do not exhibit such behavior. The main goals of the present study were, first, to characterize the postural performance in premammillary rabbits, and, second, to activate the postural system in postmammillary ones by brainstem stimulation. For evaluation of postural capacity of decerebrated rabbits, motor and EMG responses to lateral tilts of the supporting platform and to lateral pushes were recorded before and after decerebration. In addition, the righting behavior (i.e., standing up from the lying position) was video recorded. We found that, in premammillary rabbits, responses to lateral tilts and pushes were similar to those observed in intact ones, but the magnitude of responses was reduced. During righting, premammillary rabbits assumed the normal position slower than intact ones. To activate the postural system in postmammillary rabbits, we stimulated electrically two brainstem structures, the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) and the ventral tegmental field (VTF). The MLR stimulation (prior to elicitation of locomotion) and the VTF stimulation caused an increase of the tone of hindlimb extensors, and enhanced their responses to lateral tilts and to pushes. These results indicate that the basic mechanisms for maintenance of body posture and equilibrium during standing are present in decerebrated animals. They are active in the premammillary rabbits but need to be activated in the postmammillary ones."
"The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that exposure to neonatal and/or juvenile stress results in distinct persisting modification of adult male rats' emotional and social competence. Compared to non-stressed control rats, neonatally stressed rats and rats exposed to combined neonatal and juvenile stress, had reduced frequency and duration of social encounters, and lower anxiety levels. Juvenile stress alone, induced more frequent, but shorter social encounters in adulthood. No significant differences in aggressive behavior were found between any of the groups. The findings confirm the existence of developmental time windows during which exposure to unpredictable stress can affect adult emotional and social behavior without affecting cognitive function."
"Despite an abundance of research on calorie restriction (CR) altering gonadal and appetite regulating hormones, the sexual behavioural consequences of CR remain to be examined systematically. This study compared the sexual behaviour, partner preference, serum testosterone and leptin levels of male adult Hooded Wistar rats administered a CR (continuous 25%, 50% CR or a temporary restriction) with ad libitum fed controls. The temporary restriction (Previous CR) failed to alter sexual behaviour, partner preference and levels of testosterone and leptin. The moderately 25% CR males did not demonstrate an impairment in sexual behaviour but did demonstrate a reduced level of attractiveness to females in one measure of partner preference. Sexual performance was affected by a substantial CR, as the CR 50% group exhibited a longer latency to the first intromission, indicating alteration in sexual arousal. Females also consistently demonstrated a clear preference for the control group compared to the CR 50% group. These findings indicate a possible reduction in the overall reproductive potential of the substantially CR animals. Testosterone levels were equally suppressed by both the 25% and 50% CR, while leptin levels were only reduced in the CR 50% group. Leptin, rather than testosterone, may have influenced the impairment in sexual behaviour only demonstrated by the substantially CR animals. Testosterone, may, however, play a role in modulating the preference of control over CR males, as attractiveness was totally reduced by a substantial CR, and partially reduced by a moderate restricted regimen."
"The APP23 model is a transgenic mouse model for Alzheimer's disease. Cognitive performance in the APP23-model was assessed by Morris Water Maze (MWM) and passive avoidance learning, but the latter failed to show any difference between the genotypes. In search of a non-spatial alternative for assessment of hippocampus-dependent memory, we evaluated an odour paired-associate test, which is based on learning an association between two sets of odours. The protocol includes a shaping phase, in which the animals learn to dig up a reward, a preliminary training phase and a training phase, where the actual association is learned. Subsequently, mice are tested for transitive inference and subjected to a symmetry test. Impairment was seen in the APP23 mice, in comparison with wild type mice, in training; however, both groups failed the transitivity and symmetry test. Possible explanations for this discrepancy with earlier published results are the advanced age of the mice or the C57Bl/6J background, in which the model was established."
"Structural and functional brain reorganisation can occur beyond the developmental maturation period and this was recently recognised as an intrinsic property of the human central nervous system. Brain injury or altered afferent input due to environmental changes, novel experience and learning new skills are known as modulators of brain function and underlying neuroanatomic circuitry. During the past decade invasive animal studies and in vivo imaging techniques have delineated the correlates of experience dependent reorganisation. The major future challenge is to understand the behavioural consequences and cellular mechanisms underlying training-induced neuroanatomic plasticity in order to adapt treatment strategies for patients with brain injury or neurodegenerative disorders."
"During the last 25 years, neuropathological, biochemical, genetic, cell biological and even therapeutic studies in humans have all supported the hypothesis that the gradual cerebral accumulation of soluble and insoluble assemblies of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in limbic and association cortices triggers a cascade of biochemical and cellular alterations that produce the clinical phenotype of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The reasons for elevated cortical Abeta42 levels in most patients with typical, late-onset AD are unknown, but based on recent work, these could turn out to include augmented neuronal release of Abeta during some kinds of synaptic activity. Elevated levels of soluble Abeta42 monomers enable formation of soluble oligomers that can diffuse into synaptic clefts. We have identified certain APP-expressing cultured cell lines that form low-n oligomers intracellularly and release a portion of them into the medium. We find that these naturally secreted soluble oligomers--at picomolar concentrations--can disrupt hippocampal LTP in slices and in vivo and can also impair the memory of a complex learned behavior in rats. Abeta trimers appear to be more potent in disrupting LTP than are dimers. The cell-derived oligomers also decrease dendritic spine density in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, and this decrease can be prevented by administration of Abeta antibodies or small-molecule modulators of Abeta aggregation. This therapeutic progress has been accompanied by advances in imaging the Abeta deposits non-invasively in humans. A new diagnostic-therapeutic paradigm to successfully address AD and its harbinger, mild cognitive impairment-amnestic type, is emerging."
"The commonly accepted view of a highly rigid, hardwired central nervous system has evolved considerably over the past few decades. The adult central nervous system is now known to be capable of significant functional reorganization, frequently referred to as plasticity, in order to adapt to a changing environment or to a change in the CNS hardware itself, for example after trauma. Focusing on the motor system, I will discuss the cellular responses that occur after spinal cord injury and that illustrate distinct plastic events occurring at the lesion site as well as at other levels of the neuraxis. These plastic responses are not restricted to neuronal cells and to the formation of new circuitries, but can also be illustrated by the change of morphology, fate and biochemical properties of non-neuronal cells (i.e. astrocytes and neural precursor cells). These cellular responses interact with one another and contribute, together, to the tissue remodeling and to the sparing or recovery of some motor functions. Understanding these cellular responses as well as their interrelations is necessary to find appropriate approaches to manipulate one with no detrimental effects to the others. This is a prerequisite for the development of new and effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of patients with CNS injuries."
"Nicotine withdrawal is associated with multiple symptoms such as anxiety, increased appetite, and disrupted cognition in humans. Although animal models have provided insights into the somatic and affective symptoms of nicotine withdrawal, less research has focused on the effects of nicotine withdrawal on cognition. Therefore, in this study, C57BL/6J mice were used to test the effects of withdrawal from chronic nicotine on foreground and background contextual fear conditioning, which present the context as a primary or secondary stimulus, respectively. Mice withdrawn from 12 days of chronic nicotine (6.3mg/kg/day) or saline were trained and tested in either foreground or background contextual fear conditioning; nicotine withdrawal-associated deficits in contextual fear conditioning were observed in both conditions. Mice were also tested for the effects of withdrawal on pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex (PPI), a measure of sensory gating, and on the acoustic startle reflex. Mice withdrawn from 12 days of chronic nicotine (6.3 or 12.6 mg/kg/day) or saline underwent one 30-min PPI and startle session; no effect of withdrawal from chronic nicotine on PPI or startle was observed for either dose at 24h after nicotine removal. Therefore, mice were tested at different time points following withdrawal from 12.6 mg/kg/day chronic nicotine (8, 24, and 48 h after nicotine removal). No effect of withdrawal from chronic nicotine was observed at any time point for PPI. Overall, these results demonstrate that nicotine withdrawal disrupts two methods of contextual learning but not sensory gating in C57BL/6J mice."
"The present experiment addressed whether increases in corticospinal excitability following sensory stimulation with muscle tendon vibration are accompanied by reorganization of the forearm musculature representation within the primary motor cortex. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we mapped the corticomotor projection to the dominant flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECR) muscle before and after interventional sensory stimulation obtained via muscle tendon vibration (80Hz, 60 min) to the dominant distal wrist flexor tendons. Following vibration, MEP amplitude at the optimal stimulation position, motor output area, as well as map volume, increased significantly for the ECR. None of these effects reached significance for the FCR. These results suggest that the antagonistic vibratory response (AVR), which is considered to be of cortical origin, induces a delayed facilitation of musculature that is antagonistic to the site of the directly activated Ia afferent pathways. This example demonstrates that peripheral sensory stimulation can induce lasting increases in corticospinal excitability in the absence of actual movements."
"Phencyclidine (PCP) was administered to male and female Lister hooded rats on postnatal days (PND) 7, 9 and 11. All PCP animals tested in adulthood (PND 53-93) showed deficits in cognitive flexibility, specifically in their ability to shift attentional set, compared to controls. This novel finding is reminiscent of the impairment observed in schizophrenia patients, and supports the validity of the early postnatal PCP regimen as a disease-like model."
"Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a newly developed animal model of schizophrenia. It has recently been reported that when MIA is induced with the cytokine inducer polyinosinic-polycytidilic acid (poly I:C) rats do not show deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI), a test that is often considered a validity benchmark. The aim of the current experiment was to determine whether doses of poly I:C that have previously been shown to induce the behavioural features of schizophrenia can disrupt PPI in rats. Pregnant rat dams were given a single injection of poly I:C (4.0 mg/kg) or a saline injection equivalent on gestational day 15. Acoustic startle reactivity, habituation of the startle response and PPI were assessed in juvenile (34-35 day) and adult (&gt;56 day) offspring. Prenatal immune activation did not alter startle reactivity on startle-only or prepulse-only trials. Furthermore, there was no effect of MIA on habituation of the startle response. MIA does however disrupt PPI, as PPI was reduced significantly in adult MIA offspring, and a trend was observed in the juvenile animals. Our finding that prenatal poly I:C can disrupt PPI in MIA rats further validates this procedure as an animal model."
"This study assesses the effectiveness of a new virtual task to evaluate human place learning. This test was based on the hole-board maze, developed for rodent research. Its design provides an easy set of levels of difficulty. Sixty-three undergraduate students (30 men and 33 women) were randomly distributed into three testing conditions; they had to find 3, 5 and 7 rewards, respectively, in a virtual room with 16 possible rewarded positions. Subjects were asked to use the minimum amount of attempts to discover all the rewards in 10 trials. In the initial trial subjects needed to visit almost all the positions to discover the rewards. However, in the last trial an important percentage of subjects did not err. Results showed that all subjects acquired the task but with different amounts of mistakes directly related to the level of difficulty of the condition. In addition, women were slower and less accurate than men. These results agree with previous results in other virtual tasks, and support the spatial component of this test."
"Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy results in a spectrum of pathologies related to the degree of initial infarct and environmental factors, including maternal interactions. Infants actively influence their environment by crying; rat pups produce ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). Our study observed that ischemic pups engage in less time producing USVs and make fewer USVs overall, with male ischemic pups experiencing reductions in more categories than females. Future studies should consider whether alterations in mother-pup interactions result from these reductions."
"Neural mechanisms mediating perceptual grouping serve to enhance associations among stimulus elements, thereby establishing unified forms. The goals of the present study were to identify cortical areas necessary to perceptually group spatially isolated elements, and to determine if these areas are distinct from regions necessary for the discrimination of simple, solid forms. Rats were trained to discriminate horizontal and vertical lines that were either solid or composed of disjunct elements in which discrimination required perceptual grouping by proximity. Psychophysical procedures established the limits at which proximity served as a cue for grouping. Following perceptual measurements, ablations were made to selective sites within visual cortex. Lesions within area 17 or area 18A, including their interface, produced nearly complete impairment of solid line discrimination as well as perceptual grouping at all levels of proximity, whereas lesions to areas 18 or the far lateral extent of area 18A no effect on these perceptual capacities. These results indicate that grouping by proximity requires early visual processing areas, and shares cortical areas necessary for simple pattern discrimination. These results suggest that mechanisms of grouping modify primary stimulus representations, constructing a pattern of activity functional similar to that elicited by solid forms."
"In this study, the effect of concurrent use of fluvoxamine and amantadine on morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) was investigated by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) and intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection in rat. The CPP paradigms took place on 6 consecutive days by using an unbiased procedure. Our results showed that i.p. injection of morphine sulfate (2.5-10mg/kg) induced CPP in rat. On day 6, fluvoxamine (5 and 10mg/kg, i.p.), and amantadine (5 and 10mg/kg, i.p.) both increased morphine-induced conditioned place preference. Intracerebroventricular injection of fluvoxamine (10 microg/rat) and amantadine (10 microg/rat) were also increased morphine-induced conditioned preference significantly. Concurrent use of fluvoxamine (5mg/kg, i.p.; 10 microg/rat i.c.v.) and amantadine (10mg/kg, i.p.; 10 microg/rat, i.c.v.) potentiated morphine-induced conditioned preference significantly. Release of dopamine from neurons cause reinforcing behavior. Morphine produces reinforcement (reward) effect by activation of mu receptors which facilitated dopaminergic transmission through dopamine release. Fluvoxamine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, increase serotonin concentration in synaptic clefts, which is a potent stimulator of dopamine release. Amantadine also appears to work by increasing dopamine release from neuron. In conclusion, our results show that concurrent use of fluvoxamine and amantadine potentiate morphine-like effect on CPP through increasing dopaminergic transmission and this combination may simulate the rewarding effect of morphine and can be candidate for controlling the drug compulsive seeking in morphine dependent subjects."
"The serotonin 1A (5-HT(1A))-receptor is involved in a wide range of physiological functions, but has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders and depression. Although the 5-HT(1A)-receptor is one of the best described receptor subtypes of the serotonergic system, its complex distribution pattern, pre- and postsynaptic localisation, and its impact on various neurotransmitters aggravate the attribution of 5-HT(1A)-agonistic effects to behavioural outcomes. The role of 5-HT(1A)-receptors for cognitive processes seems undisputed. However, the exact involvement of pre- and postsynaptic sites remains unexplained. Genetically modified animals are a complementary approach to pharmacological studies for further investigations of the role of the 5-HT(1A)-receptor. Next to 5-HT(1A)-receptor knockout mice, two transgenic mouse lines exist that either overexpress the 5-HT(1A)-receptor transiently or permanently. The latter mouse line stands out due to the fact that a distinct overexpression is primarily found in the outer cortical layers and hippocampus, both projection areas of serotonergic neurons. Here, we discuss the findings obtained from 5-HT(1A)-receptor knockout and overexpressing mice concerning their learning and memory abilities."
"Involvement of hippocampal cannabinoid receptors in short-term memory was investigated in rats using spontaneous object and place recognition memory tasks. Rats were allowed to explore the field in which two identical objects were presented. Then after a delay period, they were placed again in the same field in which one of the two objects was replaced by another object (object recognition task) or moved to another place (place recognition task), and their exploration behavior to these objects were analyzed. Activation of hippocampal cannabinoid receptors by an agonist WIN 55,212-2 (1-2 microg/side) dose-dependently decreased the exploration of object in a new place, while it did not affect the exploration of a new object. Disruptive effect of WIN 55,212-2 on place recognition was antagonized by the pretreatment with a cannabinoid receptor antagonist AM 281 (2mg/kg, i.p.). Results suggest that hippocampal cannabinoid receptors play an important role in place recognition or spatial memory."
"The postpartum period is associated with many behavioral changes, including a reduction in anxiety, which is thought to be necessary for mothers' ability to appropriately care for infants. In laboratory rats, this reduction in anxiety requires recent contact with pups, but areas of the brain where infant contact influences neural activity to reduce anxiety are mostly unknown. We examined c-fos expression in lactating rats whose pups were removed for 4h to increase mothers' anxiety, or not removed to maintain low anxiety in mothers, followed by exposure to the anxiogenic stimuli of either brief handling or handling followed by exposure to an elevated plus maze. Control animals had their litters removed or not, but no further stimulation. A large number of neural sites traditionally implicated in regulating anxiety in male rats were examined, and similar to what is found in male rats, most showed increased Fos expression after handling and/or elevated plus-maze exposure. Litter presence before testing affected Fos expression due to handling or elevated plus-maze exposure only in the ventral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, dorsal and ventral preoptic area, ventromedial hypothalamus, lateral habenula, and supramammillary nucleus. Contrary to expectations, prior litter presence was associated with more Fos expression in most of these sites after handling and/or elevated plus-maze stimulation, and only after such stimulation. These sites may be of particular importance for how sensory inputs from infants modulate anxiety and other mood states during the postpartum period."
"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in a number of higher cognitive functions as well as processing emotions and regulation of stress responses. Hemispheric specialization of the PFC in humans in emotional processing is well documented, and there is evidence that a similar functional lateralization is present in all mammals. Recent findings suggest the possibility of an intrinsic structural hemispheric asymmetry in the rat medial PFC (mPFC). Specifically, interhemispheric differences have been found in the architecture of pyramidal cell apical dendritic trees together with hemispheric asymmetry in cell proliferation including gliogenesis. It is now well established that chronic stress has a profound impact on neural plasticity in a number of corticolimbic structures and affects the etiology, pathophysiology, and therapeutic outcome of most psychiatric disorders. We summarize recent experimental data documenting pronounced dendritic remodeling of pyramidal cells and suppressed gliogenesis in the mPFC of rats subjected to chronic stress or to artificially elevated glucocorticoid levels. The stress affect on these structural elements seems to be hemispheric specific, often abolishing or even reversing natural asymmetries seen at the cellular level. We discuss these preclinical observations with respect to clinical findings that show impaired function, altered lateralization and histopathological changes in the PFC in psychiatric patients. We argue that it is important to define the kinds of structural changes that result from long-term stress exposure because this knowledge will improve the identification of cellular endophenotypes in various psychiatric disorders."
"Many lines of evidence indicate that theta rhythm, a prominent neural oscillatory mode found in the mammalian hippocampus, plays a key role in the acquisition, processing, and retrieval of memories. However, a predictive neurophysiological feature of the baseline theta rhythm that correlates with the learning rate across different animals has yet to be identified. Here we show that the mean theta rhythm speed observed during baseline periods of immobility has a strong positive correlation with the rate at which rats learn an operant task. This relationship is observed across rats, during both quiet waking (r=0.82; p&lt;0.01) and paradoxical sleep (r=0.83; p&lt;0.01), suggesting that the basal theta frequency relates to basic neurological processes that are important in the acquisition of operant behavior."
"Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength is a long-lasting form of synaptic plasticity that has been linked to information storage. Although the molecular and cellular events underlying LTP are not yet fully understood, it is generally accepted that changes in dendritic spine calcium levels as well as local protein synthesis play a central role. These two processes may be influenced by the presence of a spine apparatus, a distinct neuronal organelle found in a subpopulation of telencephalic spines. Mice lacking spine apparatuses (synaptopodin-deficient mice) show deficits in LTP and impaired spatial learning supporting the involvement of the spine apparatus in synaptic plasticity. In our review, we consider the possible roles of the spine apparatus in LTP1 (protein synthesis-independent), LTP2 (translation-dependent and transcription-independent) and LTP3 (translation- and transcription-dependent) and discuss the effects of the spine apparatus on learning and memory."
"Whilst dopamine replacement improves cardinal features of Parkinson's disease, chronic levodopa administration is associated with dose-related side effects and not all symptoms are ameliorated, necessitating the development of new treatments. Studies of trishomocubanes, a novel group of sigma ligands, have shown enhanced amphetamine-stimulated striatal release of dopamine and a potentially neuroprotective action in vitro and reversal of reserpine-induced catalepsy in vivo. Such effects warrant investigation in animal models of parkinsonism. Our study therefore examines two novel trishomocubane compounds, N-(3'-fluorophenyl)methyl-4-azahexacyclo[5.4.1.0(2,6).0(3,10).0(5,9).0(8,11)]dodecan-3-ol (1) and, N-(3'-fluorophenyl)ethyl-4-azahexacyclo[5.4.1.0(2,6).0(3,10).0(5,9).0(8,11)]dodecan-3-ol (2) in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of Parkinson's disease. A variety of motor behaviours were studied in rats given 6-OHDA lesions. Groups of lesioned rats were given either (1) or (2) or vehicle solution i.p. Acute administration of 3 mg/kg (1) resulted in a decrease in locomotor activity. Twenty-five milligrams per kilogram (2) caused a decrease in locomotor activity at t=10 and t=20 min of the locomotor test but this was not found when (2) was co-administered with either apomorphine or amphetamine. The decreased locomotor activity indicates that (1) and (2) may have sedative/anxiolytic effect(s). However, elevated plus maze data failed to demonstrate anxiolysis with (2). Quantification of dopaminergic neurons did not demonstrate any significant difference in the magnitude of cell loss between drug-treated vs. vehicle treated rats so no neuroprotective effect was demonstrated in this model at the doses utilised."
"We compared the effect of entopallial lesions with that of hippocampal lesions on pattern discrimination in zebra finches. The birds were trained to discriminate a feeder with a dot pattern from feeders with a stripe pattern, all located at the floor of a small aviary. When the birds had learned the discrimination, entopallium or hippocampus was damaged by ibotenic acid injection. Entopallial lesions caused deficits in the discrimination, while hippocampal lesions did not. As shown in previous experiments using the same experimental design with feeders of one colour and without distinct pattern [Watanabe S, Bischof HJ. Effects of hippocampal lesions on acquisition and retention of spatial learning in zebra finches. Behav Brain Res 2004;155:147-52], hippocampal lesions cause strong deficits in spatial orientation. Taken together, our experiments prove that the avian hippocampus is involved in spatial learning, but not in pattern discrimination tasks."
"Electrical stimulation of the external lateral parabrachial subnucleus (LPBe) may induce rewarding or aversive behaviors in animals subjected to two different learning discrimination tasks. Statistical analysis found no significant differences between the group receiving electrical stimulation of the brain and the non-stimulated control group. However, rewarding or aversive behaviors were consistent and positively correlated between the two discrimination tasks in the stimulated group. Thus, these tests differed in the gustatory stimuli used, in the right/left position of stimulation-associated/non-associated flavors, and in the cage in which experiments were performed. This behavioral consistency and corresponding correlation were not observed in the non-stimulated control group. These results suggest the existence of aversive and reward systems that are differentiated but anatomically very close. Therefore, the activation of aversive or rewarding systems may depend on the precise location of the electrode implanted in the LPBe of each animal."
"Over the past 30 years, extensive research has been conducted in the field of cortical plasticity, under the impetus of seminal studies showing that the mature brain retains a capacity to reorganize the morphological and functional architecture of its neural circuits in order to adapt to environmental changes and mediate functional recovery following injury. Much effort has been focused on determining how idiosyncratic experience translates into molecular, structural and physiological changes in the sensory and motor representations embedded within cortical networks. The wealth of data generated by a broad spectrum of experimental manipulations has allowed unprecedented progress in our understanding of the physiological processes and neuroplasticity mechanisms underlying cortical representational remodeling. The objective of the present review is to put various facets of cortical map plasticity into perspective so as to examine possible links between changes occurring at multiple scales of the neural organization of the mature brain. The main focus is on neural substrates that mediate the instructive influence of experience and behavioral context on cortical reorganization, and perceptual correlates of representational remodeling."
"Lesion of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nbm) is a suitable approach to study cognitive deficit and behavior alterations involving cholinergic dysfunction, which is associated with the major types of dementia. Cortical astrogliosis also has been described in this model, but it is not clear whether hippocampal astrocytes are activated. In this study, we investigated possible specific astrocyte alterations in the hippocampi of Wistar rats submitted to nbm damage with ibotenic acid, investigating the content and immunohistochemistry of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), as well as S100B protein content, glutamate uptake and glutamine synthetase activity on the 7th and 28th post-lesion days. Cognitive deficit was confirmed by the step-down inhibitory avoidance task. Interestingly, we found a decrease in GFAP content, S100B content and glutamate uptake activity in the hippocampus on the 28th day after nbm lesion. No alterations were observed in glutamine synthetase activity or in the cerebrospinal fluid S100B content. Although our data suggest caution in the use of nbm lesion with ibotenic acid as a dementia model, it is possible that these alterations could contribute to the cognitive deficit observed in these rats."
"The immediate early genes (IEGs) have been suggested to be implicated in mechanisms of addiction, as well as in learning and memory processes. fosB, which belongs to IEG, has been reported to have pleiotropic impact on response to psychoactive drugs, as well as motivational and stress-related behaviours. In the present study, we used mice with constitutive knock-out of fosB in order to study fosB role in mouse phenotype. We studied rewarding properties of morphine (10mg/kg i.p.) in conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. Additionally, we studied fosB role in spatial memory and spatial working memory using elevated plus maze model of spatial learning (EPMSL) and delayed non-match to place task (DNMTP). In further studies, locomotor, depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviours were measured. Rewarding effects of morphine in fosB -/- mice were abolished whereas spatial learning was impaired. On the other hand, we found no significant differences in locomotor activity, depression-like and anxiety-like behaviours. In summary, our results indicate that mice lacking fosB are less sensitive to rewarding properties of morphine and display spatial memory impairment and suggest involvement of fosB and its proteins in motivational aspects of reinforcers as well as in learning and memory processes."
"Where are my hands? The brain can answer this question using sensory information arising from vision, proprioception, or touch. Other sources of information about the position of our hands can be derived from multisensory interactions (or potential interactions) with our close environment, such as when we grasp or avoid objects. The pioneering study of multisensory representations of peripersonal space was published in Behavioural Brain Research almost 30 years ago [Rizzolatti G, Scandolara C, Matelli M, Gentilucci M. Afferent properties of periarcuate neurons in macaque monkeys. II. Visual responses. Behav Brain Res 1981;2:147-63]. More recently, neurophysiological, neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and behavioural studies have contributed a wealth of evidence concerning hand-centred representations of objects in peripersonal space. This evidence is examined here in detail. In particular, we focus on the use of artificial dummy hands as powerful instruments to manipulate the brain's representation of hand position, peripersonal space, and of hand ownership. We also review recent studies of the 'rubber hand illusion' and related phenomena, such as the visual capture of touch, and the recalibration of hand position sense, and discuss their findings in the light of research on peripersonal space. Finally, we propose a simple model that situates the 'rubber hand illusion' in the neurophysiological framework of multisensory hand-centred representations of space."
"To date, studies on soman-induced neuropathology mainly focused on the hippocampus, since this brain region is a well-delimited area with easily detectable pyramidal neurons. Moreover, the hippocampus is severely damaged after soman exposure leading to a substantial alteration of behavioral mnemonic processes. The neuropathology described in the hippocampus, however, and its behavioral consequences cannot be extrapolated to all other limbic damaged brain areas such as the amygdala. Accordingly, in this inaugural paper, using hemalun-phloxin staining and NeuN immunohistochemistry, the number of damaged and residual healthy neurons was quantified in the amygdala in mice over a 90-day period after soman injection (1.2LD(50) of soman). On post-soman day 1, a moderate neuronal cell death (about 23% of the whole neurons) was evidenced. In parallel, a large quantity of degenerating neurons (about 36% of the whole neurons) occurred in this brain region and survived from post-soman day 1 to day 15. The death of these damaged neurons was initiated on post-soman day 30, and ended on post-soman day 90. Concomitantly, as quantified by NeuN immunohistochemistry, a clear neuronal regeneration was demonstrated in the amygdala of soman-poisoned mice between 60 and 90 days after neurotoxicant exposure. In the companion paper (see part 2), the possible effects of both long-term neuropathology and delayed neuronal regeneration were evaluated on amygdala-driven emotional processes."
"An important question in neuroscience is how different aspects of a stimulus are encoded at different stages of neural processing. In this review, I discuss studies investigating the peripheral neural code for perceived intensity in touch. One of the recurrent themes in this line of research is that information about stimulus intensity is encoded in the activity of populations of neurons. Not only is information integrated across afferents of a given type, but information is also combined across submodalities to yield a unified percept of stimulus intensity. The convergence of information stemming from multiple submodalities is particularly interesting in light of the fact that these are generally thought to be parallel sensory channels with distinct sensory functions and little cross-channel interactions. I discuss implications of a recently proposed model of intensity coding for psychophysical functions and for the coding of intensity in cortex. I also briefly review the peripheral coding of intensity in other sensory modalities."
"The interpretation of knockout and transgenic mouse studies in pain research critically depends on detailed knowledge of the performance profile of the background strains. Pain-related behavior was compared between four relevant mouse strains (C57BL/6J, 129S6/SvEv, B6 129 F1 and NMRI mice of both sexes) using an extended test battery that included an unusual variety of assays for thermal and mechanical acute nociception, and inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Strain- and gender-dependent differences were demonstrated in many of these nociceptive assays. Particularly, C57BL and 129 mice, which serve as the default genetic backgrounds for experiments in genetically altered mice, display quite different patterns of nociceptive performance. Compared to C57BL/6J mice, 129S6/SvEv animals are less sensitive to inflammatory pain conditions (thermal sensitivity after carrageenan subplantar injection; flinch behavior after formalin injection), while the opposite is observed in the neuropathic pain condition and the visceral pain model. These data may be of special interest for genetic studies, where issues related to the background phenotype may confound their interpretation."
"Selegiline, an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, has been demonstrated to have a potential cognition-improving effect in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) undergoing treatment with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil. To confirm such clinical events, we investigated whether co-administration of donepezil with selegiline had a synergistic cognition-improving effect in an animal model of AD. Intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid beta protein fragment 25-35 [Abeta(25-35)] induced impairment of learning and memory in a Y-maze, novel object recognition and contextual fear conditioning tests. Either donepezil or selegiline alone improved the cognitive impairments in the Y-maze and conditioned fear learning tasks in Abeta(25-35)-injected mice, whereas donepezil, but not selegiline, failed to improve the impairment in a novel object recognition task. Co-administration of donepezil with selegiline, at doses that do not exert efficacy individually, significantly improved the deficits in all three tests, indicating a synergistic cognition-improving effect. These alleviating effects were antagonized by pretreatment with a muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine and a dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol. These results suggest that selegiline potentiates the effect of donepezil on the cognitive impairment, and that the synergistic effect may be mediated through both the cholinergic and dopaminergic systems."
"In the Ultimatum Game, participants typically reject monetary offers they consider unfair even if the alternative is to gain no money at all. In the present study, ERPs were recorded while subjects processed different offers of a proposer. In addition to clearly fair and unfair offers, mid-value offers which cannot be easily classified as fair or unfair and therefore involve more elaborate decision making were analyzed. A fast initial distinction between fair and other kinds of offers was reflected by amplitude of the feedback related negativity (FRN). Mid-value offers were associated with longer RTs, and a larger N350 amplitude. In addition, source analyses revealed a specific involvement of the superior temporal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule during processing of mid-value offers compared to offers categorized clearly as fair or unfair, suggesting a contribution of mentalizing about the intention of the proposer to the decision making process. Taken together, the present findings support the idea that economic decisions are significantly affected by non-rational factors, trying to narrow the gap between formal theory and the real decisional behaviour."
"Methylmercury (MeHg) has cytotoxic effects on animals and humans, and a major target organ for MeHg is the central nervous system (CNS). It is well known that the developing CNS is extremely vulnerable to MeHg-induced changes in comparison to the mature brain. Most studies have concentrated on the direct effects of high levels of prenatal MeHg exposure. Surprisingly, behavioral outcomes found in adult offspring exposed developmentally to the neurotoxic effects of chronic, low-dose mercury more akin to ingestion in humans are not well characterized. The objective of this study was to determine whether such exposure produces deleterious effects on behavior in adult mice, including motor/coordination abilities, overall activity and mnemonic function. Developing mouse fetuses were exposed in utero during gestational days 8-18 by giving pregnant C57Bl/6J female mice food containing MeHg at a daily dose of 0.01 mg/kg body weight. Adult mice prenatally exposed to MeHg exhibited significant deficits in motor abilities, coordination, and overall activity, as measured by rotarod, footprint analysis and open field. In addition, MeHg-exposed mice were impaired with respect to reference memory but not in a visible, cued version of the Morris water maze task. These results indicate that prenatal exposure to the lowest dose of MeHg examined to date can have long-lasting motor and cognitive consequences on adult offspring. These findings have far reaching implications related to putative safe levels of MeHg ingestion, particularly during pregnancy, and increasing rates of cognitive and psychological disorders (e.g. attention hyperactivity deficit disorder, autism) in our society."
"Environmental stimuli associated with amphetamine (AMPH) can elicit conditioned locomotion in rats, and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is known to be important in this process. This study examined the contribution of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in the NAcc to the expression of conditioned locomotion in an AMPH-associated environment. Rats in different groups were administered injections in five 3-day blocks: Paired, AMPH (1.0mg/kg, IP) in locomotor activity boxes on day 1 and saline in their home cages on day 2; Unpaired, saline in the activity boxes on day 1 and AMPH in their home cages on day 2; or Control, saline in both environments. No injections were administered on day 3 of each block. One week after the last conditioning block, all rats were tested for their conditioned locomotor response in the activity boxes for 1h following an IP saline injection. In Paired rats, this injection was preceded by a bilateral microinjection into the NAcc of saline, the group I mGluR antagonist, AIDA (0.5, 5.0 nmol/side), or the group II mGluR antagonist, EGLU (0.5, 5.0 nmol/side). Unpaired and Control rats received NAcc saline. As expected, Paired rats showed both increased locomotor activity and rearing compared to rats in either the Unpaired or Control groups. However, the expression of this conditioned hyper-locomotion was dose-dependently inhibited by NAcc EGLU, but not by AIDA. These results suggest that activation of group II, but not of group I, mGluRs in the NAcc contributes to the expression of conditioned locomotion in an environment associated with amphetamine."
"Reduced sleep interferes with contextual but not cued learned fear, and it was suggested that this selectivity reflects underlying neural substrates. The apparent lack of contextual fear in sleep-deprived animals, however, could be secondary to hyperactivity. Also, changing the parameters of cued conditioning can change the neural pathways involved, such that some types of cued fear might be sensitive to sleep loss. To address these issues, we measured fear expressed with conditioned defecation as well as behavior, and used a trace cued learning paradigm. Using the platform-over-water method, male Sprague-Dawley rats were continuously sleep-deprived for 3 days, or for 20 h/day for 3 days. Animals then underwent fear conditioning, and were tested for learning the next day. Sleep-deprived or -restricted animals showed a lack of contextual fear at testing, as conditioned freezing and defecation were minimal. Sleep deprivation also blocked cued fear after trace conditioning. Therefore, reduced sleep impairs contextual learning, and impairs cued learning only when the hippocampus is involved. The data support a model in which sleep loss interferes with hippocampal function while sparing amygdala function."
"The purpose of the present experiment was to evaluate timing behavior in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and compare it to the performance of Wistar Kyoto (WKY), and Wistar (WI) rats. In the first phase of the experiment, the subjects were exposed to a peak-interval procedure, in which fixed-interval 30s trials were alternated with nonreinforced and extended (peak) trials. After 60 sessions, an approximation to a Gaussian probability density function was fitted to the response rate during peak trials in order to estimate the peak time, the peak rate and the Weber fraction. The results showed no difference among the strains in the peak time and the Weber fraction, but a higher peak rate in SHR. In the second phase of the experiment, a gap procedure was introduced; in 80% of the peak trials the stimuli associated with the fixed interval and peak trials were turned off for 9s. Gap trials produced peak time shifts that were longer than those expected if the clock had stopped during the gap but shorter than those had the clock been reset, and no significant differences between the strains were found. Given the great importance that different theories give to temporal processing in the development of the main symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and the existence of time perception deficits in humans with ADHD, the present results question the validity of SHR as an animal model of that disorder, and suggest the necessity of exploring the timing behavior of other animal models of ADHD."
"Zebrafish has been in the forefront of developmental biology and genetics, but only recently has interest in their behavior increased. Zebrafish are small and prolific, which lends this species to high throughput screening applications. A typical feature of zebrafish is its propensity to aggregate in groups, a behavior known as shoaling. Thus, zebrafish has been proposed as a possible model organism appropriate for the analysis of the genetics of vertebrate social behavior. However, shoaling behavior is not well characterized in zebrafish. Here, using a recently developed software application, we first investigate how zebrafish respond to conspecific and heterospecific fish species that differ in coloration and/or shoaling tendencies. We found that zebrafish shoaled with their own species but not with two heterospecific species, one of which was a shoaling the other a non-shoaling species. In addition, we have started the analysis of visual stimuli that zebrafish may utilize to determine whether to shoal with a fish or not. We systematically modified the color, the location, the pattern, and the body shape of computer animated zebrafish images and presented them to experimental zebrafish. The subjects responded differentially to some of these stimuli showing preference for yellow and avoidance of elongated zebrafish images. Our results suggest that computerized stimulus presentation and automated behavioral quantification of zebrafish responses are feasible, which in turn implies that high throughput forward genetic mutation or drug screening will be possible in the analysis of social behavior with this model organism."
"There is growing interest in the effects of voluntary wheel running activity on brain and behaviour in laboratory rodents and their implications to humans. Here, the major findings to date on the impact of exercise on mental health and diseases as well as the possible underlying neurobiological mechanisms are summarised. Several critical modulating factors on the neurobehavioural effects of wheel running exercise are emphasized and discussed--including the amount of wheel running, sex and strain/species differences. We also reported the outcome of an empirical investigation of the impact of wheel running exercise on the expression of both cognitive and non-cognitive phenotypes in a triple (3 x Tg-AD) transgenic mouse model for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clear sex- and paradigm-specific effects of exercise on the genetically determined phenotypes are illustrated, including the efficacy of wheel running activity in attenuating the sex-specific cognitive deficits. It is concluded that the wheel running paradigm represents a unique environmental manipulation for the investigation of neurobehavioural plasticity in terms of gene-environment interactions relevant to the pathogenesis and therapies of certain neuropsychiatric conditions."
"Core symptoms of autism include deficits in social interaction, impaired communication, and restricted, repetitive behaviors. The repetitive behavior domain encompasses abnormal motoric stereotypy, an inflexible insistence on sameness, and resistance to change. In recent years, many genetic mouse models of autism and related disorders have been developed, based on candidate genes for disease susceptibility. The present studies are part of an ongoing initiative to develop appropriate behavioral tasks for the evaluation of mouse models relevant to autism. We have previously reported profiles for sociability, preference for social novelty, and resistance to changes in a learned pattern of behavior, as well as other functional domains, for 10 inbred mouse strains of divergent genetic backgrounds. The present studies extend this multi-component behavioral characterization to several additional strains: C58/J, NOD/LtJ, NZB/B1NJ, PL/J, SJL/J, SWR/J, and the wild-derived PERA/EiJ. C58/J, NOD/LtJ, NZB/B1NJ, SJL/J, and PERA/EiJ demonstrated low sociability, measured by time spent in proximity to an unfamiliar conspecific, with 30-60% of mice from these strains showing social avoidance. In the Morris water maze, NZB/B1NJ had a persistent bias for the quadrant where the hidden platform was located during acquisition, even after 9 days of reversal training. A particularly interesting profile was found for C58/J, which had low social preference, poor performance in the T-maze, and overt motoric stereotypy. Overall, this set of tasks and observational methods provides a strategy for evaluating novel mouse models in behavioral domains relevant to the autism phenotype."
"Estrogen has well known effects on sexual behavior, however the role of the estrogen receptors (ER) alpha and beta on sexual behavior remains to be fully determined. This study investigated the individual and co-operative involvement of ERalpha and beta on sexual behaviors in the adult female rat. Subtype selective ER agonists, propyl-pyrazole triol (PPT; ERalpha agonist) and diarylpropionitrile (DPN; ERbeta agonist) were utilized to examine each receptor subtype's contribution, individual and co-operative, for both receptive (lordosis) and proceptive (hopping/darting, 'ear wiggling') female sexual behaviors. Ovariectomized female rats received subcutaneous injections of either: sesame oil (OIL), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), estradiol benzoate (EB; 10 microg/0.1 ml OIL), one of three doses of the ERalpha agonist PPT (1.25mg, 2.5mg or 5.0mg/0.1 ml DMSO), one of three doses of the ERbeta agonist DPN (1.25mg, 2.5mg or 5.0mg/0.1 ml DMSO) or a combination dose of PPT and DPN (2.5mg PPT+2.5mg DPN/0.1 ml DMSO) for two consecutive days, 48 and 24h prior to testing followed by a progesterone injection (500 microg/0.1 ml OIL) 4h prior to testing in order to elicit sexual behavior. The ERalpha agonist PPT, but not the ERbeta agonist DPN, elicited both proceptive and receptive behavior. PPT at doses of 2.5 and 5.0mg significantly elicited lordosis and proceptive behavior ('ear wiggling', hopping and darting). Intriguingly, the administration of both agonists together at the 2.5mg dose resulted in reduced levels of proceptivity and receptivity, suggesting that ERbeta modulates ERalpha's ability to elicit receptive and proceptive sexual behavior."
"Animal models of genetic diseases obtained by transferring human mutated genes in the mouse are widely used in biomedical based research. They constitute efficient tools to study mechanisms underlying abnormal phenotypes. Unfortunately, the phenotype of the transgene is often obscured by the genetic background of the embryonic stem cells and that of the recipient strain used to create the transgenic line. It is also known, from the literature, that repeatedly backcrossing a transgenic strain to an inbred background may have unfavorable effects that can result in the loss of the transgenic line. In order to analyze the influences of the genetic background on the transgene expression, we studied the effects of the hAPPswe transgene involved in Alzheimer's Amyloid Pathology, in 3 genetic backgrounds differing by their genetic heterogeneity (homozygous vs heterozygous) and the strain of origin (C57BL6, CBA, B6SJL F1) after only one generation backcrossing. Three different behavioral paradigms were used to assess the psychological and cognitive phenotypic differences: elevated plus maze, morris navigation task and contextual fear conditioning. Our data indicate that the best solution to maintain the transgenic line is to backcross repeatedly the transgenic mice into the F1 hybrid cross that was used to create the transgenic strain, whereas phenotyping should be performed comparatively after only one generation backcrossing into various well chosen F1 or inbred backgrounds."
"We have recently shown that sub-chronic phencyclidine (PCP) treatment produces social behaviour deficits in female rats which are reversed by ziprasidone but not haloperidol or clozapine. This investigation was designed to extend the previous findings and identify the role of 5-HT(1A) receptors in mediating the effects of these drugs in this model. Female hooded-Lister rats received vehicle (n=36; intraperitoneal (i.p.)) or PCP (n=22; 2mg/kg, i.p.) twice daily for 7 days, followed by a 7-day washout period. On test days, PCP-treated rats were treated acutely with aripiprazole (5mg/kg, s.c.) or WAY100635 (0.5mg/kg, i.p.) alone and in combination. In a second experiment, PCP-treated rats were treated acutely with either fluoxetine (2.5mg/kg, i.p.) or chlordiazepoxide (CDP) (2.5mg/kg, i.p.) all 30 min prior to testing. For the test, pairs of unfamiliar rats receiving acute doses of drugs described above were placed in the test arena and social behaviours (following, sniffing, climbing over and under, exploration of inanimate object and avoiding) were recorded on video for subsequent blind scoring. The results showed that PCP-induced deficits in social behaviours were reversed by acute treatment with both aripiprazole and fluoxetine but not CDP or WAY100635. Furthermore, pre-treatment with WAY100635 prevented the reversal of social behaviour deficits observed with aripiprazole. These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of drugs such as aripiprazole and fluoxetine on PCP-induced social behaviour deficits, a potential model of negative symptoms of schizophrenia, may be a consequence of modifications of the serotonergic system, in particular through an interaction with 5-HT(1A) receptors."
"Available data suggest that estradiol exerts an inhibitory effect on food intake by modulating the actions of multiple gut- and brain-derived peptides implicated in the control of food intake. For example, recent studies have shown that estradiol decreases the orexigenic effects of ghrelin and melanin-concentrating hormone. In the present study, we examined estradiol's ability to decrease the actions of two additional orexigenic peptides, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP). Food intake was monitored following lateral ventricular infusions of 5 microg NPY, 10 microg AgRP, or saline vehicle in ovariectomized rats treated with either 1 microg estradiol or sesame oil vehicle. NPY increased food intake for 2h in both oil- and estradiol-treated ovariectomized rats. During this interval, the orexigenic effect of NPY was significantly greater in oil-treated rats, relative to estradiol-treated rats. In contrast to the short-term action of NPY, a single injection of AgRP increased food intake for 3 days in oil- and estradiol-treated rats. Meal pattern analysis revealed that the orexigenic effect of AgRP is mediated by an increase in meal size, not meal number. Unlike that observed following NPY treatment, estradiol failed to modulate the magnitude by which AgRP increased food intake and meal size. We conclude that a physiological regimen of estradiol treatment decreases the orexigenic effect of NPY, but not AgRP, in ovariectomized rats."
"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter whose effects are mediated by at least 13 distinct G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) of the type A family which includes the monoamine receptors and a combination of ligand-gated ion channels (5-HT3) of the Cys loop family which constitutes heteropentamers. 5-HT receptors are currently divided into seven classes (5-HT1 to 5-HT7), based on structural, transductional and operational features. While this degree of physical diversity clearly underscores the physiological importance of serotonin, evidence for an even greater degree of operational diversity is supported by the existence of a great number of splice and editing variants for several 5-HT receptors, their possible modulation by accessory proteins and chaperones, as well as their potential to form homo or heteromers both at the GPCR and at the ligand-gated channel level."
"Environmental stimuli such as caloric availability during the perinatal period exert a profound influence on the development of an organism. Studies in this domain have focused on the effects of under- and malnutrition while the effects of more mild levels of restriction have not been delineated. Rat dams and their offspring were subjected to one of five dietary regimens: control, CR50% for 3 days preconception, CR25% during gestation, CR25% during lactation, and CR25% during gestation, lactation, and post-weaning (lifelong). The pup retrieval test and maternal observations were conducted during lactation to quantify maternal care. In the pup retrieval test, dams that were concurrently experiencing CR (i.e., from the lactation and lifelong groups) displayed shorter latencies to retrieve all pups than the control and preconception groups and the lactation group constructed better nests than all groups. Adult offspring were tested in three tests of anxiety: the elevated plus maze, open field, and emergence test. No differences were observed in the elevated plus maze; however, in the open field preconception animals made fewer entries and spent more time in the central zone than controls. In addition, preconception offspring exhibited longer latencies to full body emergence, spent less time fully emerged, and spent more time engaged in risk assessment behaviours than all other groups. Offspring from the preconception group were also on average 11% heavier than control rats throughout life and displayed 37% higher serum leptin concentrations than controls. A potential role for leptin in the anxiogenic effect of preconception CR is discussed."
"Using a combination of the paradigm of conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and of the paradigm of social interactions, we report here that in the rat, eating while anxious may result in long-term alterations in social behavior. In the conventional CTA, the subject learns to associate a tastant (the conditioned stimulus, CS) with delayed toxicosis (an unconditioned stimulus, UCS) to yield taste aversion (the conditioned response, CR). However, the association of taste with delayed negative internal states that could generate CRs that are different from taste aversion should not be neglected. Such associations may contribute to the ontogenesis, reinforcement and symptoms of some types of taste- and food-related disorders. We have recently reported that a delayed anxiety-like state, induced by the anxiogenic drug meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), can specifically associate with taste to produce CTA. We now show that a similar protocol results in a marked lingering impairment in social interactions in response to the conditioned taste. This is hence a learned situation in which food and company do not mix well."
"The response properties of 48 right (n=24) and left (n=24) hippocampal formation (HF) cells were examined by recording from freely moving homing pigeons as they foraged in an open-field environment with unstable goal locations. Compared to previous results based on HF recordings from environments with stable goal locations, the spatial signal of the HF neurons recorded in the present study was substantially diminished; there was little indication of PATH cells found in previous HF recordings and nothing resembling place cells routinely recorded in rat hippocampus under similar conditions. However, lateralized response properties were detected. Right HF cells dramatically reduced their firing rates during a foraging session, resulting in very low reliability scores. By contrast, left HF cells maintained firing rates throughout sessions and displayed modestly higher reliability scores compared to right HF neurons. Notable was one striking group of cells (n=13), predominantly found in the right HF, that displayed rate maps characterized by numerous, discrete areas of above baseline firing rates, overall very low firing rates and higher specificity than other cells recorded in this study. Overall, the data emphasize the importance of stable goal locations in shaping the spatial response profile of homing pigeon HF neurons and demonstrate the persistence of lateralized response properties under conditions when space explains little of the temporal variation in firing rate."
"Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) IIIA, or Sanfilippo syndrome, is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by severe and progressive neuropathology. Following an asymptomatic period, patients may present with sleep disturbances, cognitive decline, aggressive tendencies and hyperactivity. A naturally-occurring mouse model of MPS IIIA also exhibits many of these behavioral features and has been recently back-crossed onto a C57BL/6 genetic background. To more thoroughly characterize the behavioral phenotype of congenic MPS IIIA mice, we assessed exploratory activity and unconditioned anxiety-related behavior in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field locomotor activity. Although MPS IIIA male mice were less active in the EPM at 18 and 20 weeks of age, they were more likely to explore the open arms than their normal counter-parts suggesting reduced anxiety. Repeated EPM testing reduced exploration of the open arms in MPS IIIA mice. In the open field test, significant reductions in activity were evident in na&#xef;ve-tested male MPS IIIA mice from 10 weeks of age. Female normal and MPS IIIA mice displayed similar exploratory activity in the open field test. These differences in anxiety and locomotor activity will allow us to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic regimes for MPS IIIA as a forerunner to developing safe and effective therapies for Sanfilippo patients."
"The effects of LP-44, a selective 5-HT7 receptor agonist, and of SB-269970, a selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, on spontaneous sleep were studied in adult rats implanted for chronic sleep recordings. The 5-HT7 receptor ligands were microinjected directly into the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) during the light period of the 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Infusion of LP-44 (1.25-5.0 mM) into the DRN induced a significant reduction of rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) and of the number of REM periods. Similar effects were observed after the direct administration into the DRN of SB-269970 (0.5-1.0 mM). Pretreatment with a dose of SB-269970 (0.5 mM) that significantly affects sleep variables antagonized the LP-44 (2.5 mM)-induced suppression of REMS and of the number of REM periods. It is proposed that the suppression of REMS after microinjection of LP-44 into the DRN is related, at least in part, to the activation of GABAergic neurons in the DRN that contribute to long projections that reach, among others, the laterodorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei involved in the promotion of REMS."
"It is widely thought that regulation of post-synaptic AMPA receptors is a critical component in changes in synaptic efficacy underlying learning and memory. The regulation of AMPA receptors occurs through trafficking of the receptor and/or modulation of the receptor's channel properties and both of these processes depend on phosphorylation of the receptor. Using homologous recombination (knock-in) techniques we targeted two phosphorylation sites on the AMPA-GluR1 receptor: the CaMKII/PKC Ser 831 site and the PKA Ser 845 site. Mice with either or both of these sites mutated were then tested on an incentive learning task that assessed their ability to acquire a simple association between a cue and reward and to then use this cue as a reinforcer to guide their behavior (conditioned reinforcement). We report that, whereas WT mice showed enhanced responding for the reward-associated cue, mice with mutations of both phosphorylation sites or the Ser 831 site alone, failed to show such a conditioned reinforcement effect. By contrast, mice with only the Ser 845 site deficient showed normal CS+ reinforced responding. Thus, action at the Ser 831 phosphorylation site was necessary for normal conditioned reinforcement. Finally, the behavioral deficit was highly specific: performance on a number of other measures of motivated performance, including responding reinforced by the food itself, was unaffected by the mutations. Our findings provide novel evidence for a molecular mechanism in a form of appetitive incentive learning critical in regulating normal motivated behavior, as well as maladaptive forms such as addiction and eating disorders."
"The organophosphorus compound soman produces long-lasting epileptic seizure activity which is associated to brain damage, more particularly in the hippocampus and the amygdala. The companion paper (see part 1 in the same journal issue) describes the neuropathology in the amygdala of soman-poisoned mice. The present paper examines the long-term effects of soman poisoning on emotional reactivity in mice, 30 or 90 days after intoxication using behavioral tasks involving amygdala function. The emotional behavior was estimated in animal tests of unconditioned fear (light/dark boxes, elevated plus-maze) and conditioned fear (auditory and contextual response). In the light/dark boxes and elevated plus-maze, mice intoxicated with soman (110 microg/kg, 1.2 LD(50)) showed an anxiety-like behavior profile at post-poisoning days 30 and 90. In conditioned fear, results showed that both auditory and contextual conditioned responses are increased on post-soman day 30 but no longer on post-soman day 90, evidencing behavioral recovery overtime. This latter behavioral result is in accordance with the delayed neuronal regeneration patterns described in the companion paper (part 1)."
"Previous studies show that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is required for behavior to adjust when the value of a reinforcer decreases after satiation or pairing with gastric distress. This study evaluated the effect of pre- or post-training excitotoxic lesions of the BLA on changes in preference with another type of contingency change, reinforcer magnitude reversal. Rats were trained to press left and right levers during a variable-interval choice phase for 50 microl or 150 microl sucrose delivered to consistent locations after a 16-s delay. Tones were presented during the first and last 2s of the delay to reinforcement. The tone frequency predicted the magnitude of sucrose reinforcement in baseline conditions. All groups acquired stable preference for the lever on the large (150 microl) reinforcer side. However, nose poking during the delay to large reinforcement was highly accurate (i.e., to the reinforced side) for all groups except the rats with BLA lesions induced before training, suggesting impaired control of behavior by the tone. After the acquisition of stable preference, the locations of the reinforcer magnitudes were unpredictably reversed for a single session. Pre-training lesions blunted changes in preference when the reinforcer magnitudes were reversed. Lesions induced after stable preference was acquired, but prior to reversal, did not disrupt changes in preference. The data suggest that the BLA contributes to the adaptation of choice behavior following changes in reinforcer magnitude. Impaired learning about the tone-reinforcer magnitude relationships may have disrupted discrimination of the reinforcer magnitude reversal."
"Restraint elicits a number of physiological stress responses that can be increased or decreased in magnitude based on prior stress history. For instance, repeated exposure to restraint leads to habituation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activation to restraint. In contrast, acute restraint after a different repeated stressor leads to facilitation of HPA activity to the novel stress. Acute restraint also elicits a variety of behaviors, including struggling, but the effect of prior stress in regulating behavioral responses to restraint is not clear. The goal of the present studies was to assess struggling during restraint with or without a prior history of repeated stress. Using automated behavioral analysis software (EthoVision), we quantified struggling during restraint. We found that acutely restrained rats exhibited vigorous struggling behavior that declined during a single restraint period. Repeated restraint lead to habituated struggling behavior, whereas acute restraint after repeated swim elicited facilitated struggling behavior. These effects on struggling were found alongside expected differences in HPA activity. Removing stress-induced increases in corticosterone via adrenalectomy did not significantly affect struggling responses to restraint. Overall, restraint-induced struggling appears to be regulated in a manner similar to HPA responses to restraint, but is not dictated by adrenal hormones."
"Postnatal manipulations such as brief (early handling, EH) and long, daily mother-offspring separations (maternal separation, MS) in rats are used to study the mechanisms underlying developmental plasticity of stress and fear responses, and to model stress-related disorders in humans and in non-human animals. Current evidence suggests that, compared to non-handled rats, EH reduces hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) reactivity in the adult offspring through stimulating increased levels of active maternal care. In contrast, despite a similar increase in active maternal care, MS does not reduce HPA reactivity, thus suggesting that long mother-offspring separations may counteract the effects of increased active maternal care. We therefore attempted to selectively manipulate levels of active maternal care and durations of mother-offspring separations in neonate rats. Rat pups were exposed to different combinations of EH and MS from postnatal day (PND) 2 to 10 using a split-litter design. Maternal behaviour was recorded from PND 2 to 8 and behavioural and endocrine responses to stress were studied in adult male offspring. Low levels of maternal care combined with long mother-offspring separations increased HPA-reactivity compared to both high maternal care combined with long mother-offspring separations and low maternal care combined with brief separations. These findings further support the hypothesis that active maternal care and long mother-offspring separation act independently, and exert opposing effects, on adult offspring's HPA responses, but that increased maternal care may buffer the adverse consequences of long separations."
"Metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu5) has been implicated in memory processing in some but not all learning tasks. The reason why this receptor is involved in some tasks but not in others remains to be determined. The present experiments using rats examined effects of the mGlu5-antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP)--applied systemically i.p. (1-10mg/kg) or bilaterally into the prelimbic cortex (1-10 microg)---on the ability of rats to explore and remember new stimuli. A cross-maze, open field, and object recognition task were used to evaluate exploration and memory and it was found that: (1) locomotion during exploration of spatial environments and exploration time at novel objects were reduced by i.p. but not by prelimbic administration of MPEP, (2) spatial short-term memory was impaired in cross-maze and object discrimination was reduced after both types of administration, (3) long-term retention of spatial conditioning in the cross-maze was inhibited after i.p. applications which (4) also inhibited spontaneous alternation performance during maze-exploration. Reduced exploratory locomotion and exploration time after i.p. injections may have contributed to the observed retention impairments. However, the fact that prelimbic administration of MPEP inhibited retention without reducing exploration shows that memory formation was also impacted directly by prelimbic mGlu5 in both spatial and non-spatial learning."
"There has long been an interest in exploring the functional dynamics of the brain's connectivity during cognitive processing, and some recent methodological developments now allow us to test important long-standing hypotheses. This review focuses on the recent development of combined online transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) and on new studies that have employed this combination to study causal interactions between neural areas involved in perception and cognition."
"It is generally accepted that different brain regions regulate specific behavioral responses and that structural alterations in these regions may affect behavior. We investigated whether inter-individual variability in novelty-induced behaviors in C57BL/6J mice correlates with numbers of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus and cholinergic neurons in the septum. We found that exploration of new stimuli correlated negatively with numbers of noradrenergic neurons, whereas anxiety correlated positively with numbers of cholinergic neurons. The observed correlations suggest physiologically plausible links between structure and function and indicate that precise morphological estimates can be predictive for behavioral responses."
"The deficits of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are believed to result, at least in part, from neurotoxicity of beta-amyloid (Abeta), a set of 38-43 amino acid fragments derived from the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). In addition, APP generates the APP-C31 and Jcasp toxic fragments intracellularly by cleavage at Asp664. We reported that mutation of Asp664 to Ala in a FAD-human APP transgene prevented AD-like deficits but did not affect Abeta production or deposition in PDAPP mice, arguing that D664A plays a crucial role in the generation of AD-like deficits. Whether D664A simply delays or completely prevents AD-like deficits, however, remained undefined. To address this question, we performed behavioral studies longitudinally on a pretrained mouse cohort at 9 and 13 months (mo) of age. While behavioral deficits were present in PDAPP mice, performance of Tg PDAPP(D664A) mice was not significantly different from non-Tg littermates' across all ages tested. Moreover, aberrant patterns in non-cognitive components of behavior in PDAPP mice were ameliorated in PDAPP(D664A) animals as well. A trend towards poorer retention at 9 mo and poorer learning at 13 mo that did not reach statistical significance was observed in PDAPP(D664A) mice. These results support and extend recent studies showing that cleavage of APP at Asp664 (or protein-protein interactions dependent on Asp664) is a crucial event in the generation of AD-like deficits in PDAPP mice. Our results thus further demonstrate that the D664A mutation either completely precludes, or markedly delays (beyond 13 mo) the appearance of AD-like deficits in this mouse model of AD."
"While the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is best known for its role in regulating serum cholesterol, LDLR is expressed in brain, suggesting that it may play a role in CNS function as well. Here, using mice with a null mutation in LDLR (LDLR-/-), we investigated whether the absence of LDLR affects a series of behavioral functions. We also utilized the fact that plasma cholesterol levels can be regulated in LDLR-/- mice by manipulating dietary cholesterol to investigate whether elevated plasma cholesterol might independently affect behavioral performance. LDLR-/- mice showed no major deficits in general sensory or motor function. However, LDLR-/- mice exhibited increased locomotor activity in an open field test without evidence of altered anxiety in either an open field or a light/dark emergence test. By contrast, modulating dietary cholesterol produced only isolated effects. While both C57BL/6J and LDLR-/- mice fed a high cholesterol diet showed increased anxiety in a light/dark task, and LDLR-/- mice fed a high cholesterol diet exhibited longer target latencies in the probe trial of the Morris water maze, no other findings supported a general effect of cholesterol on anxiety or spatial memory. Collectively these studies suggest that while LDLR-/- mice exhibit no major developmental defects, LDLR nevertheless plays a significant role in modulating locomotor behavior in the adult."
"Based on the 'endogenous dopamine sensitization' hypothesis of schizophrenia the present study employed a repeated amphetamine administration regime in order to investigate the behavioral, neurochemical and neuroanatomical consequences following short- and long-term withdrawal periods. The escalating amphetamine administration schedule consisted of three injections per day over a 6-day period with the dosage ranging from 1 to 8 mg/kg. It was demonstrated that following both short- (4 days) and long-term (66 days) withdrawal periods latent inhibition (LI) and prepulse inhibition (PPI), two translational paradigms highly relevant to schizophrenia, were disrupted. A challenge injection verified sensitization in two different cohorts of animals at 40 and 70 days following cessation of treatment. Neurochemical evaluation demonstrated a reduction in dopamine levels in the caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens core and shell as well as an enhanced utilization ratio in the caudate-putamen after both withdrawal periods. Similar to the findings from post-mortem studies of brains of schizophrenic patients, a downregulation of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) immunoreactivity was found in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, thalamus, and amygdala in amphetamine pretreated animals following longer withdrawal periods. This was not accompanied by enhanced neurotoxicity or reactive gliosis as demonstrated by the immunohistological analysis using the apoptotic marker activated Caspase-3 and GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein; a marker for astrocytes) following both short- and long-term withdrawal periods. In conclusion, it is suggested that these findings constitute a highly reliable and valid animal model of schizophrenia."
"Vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP) inhibits both the classical and alternate complement pathways. In diseases such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), pathological inflammation is caused by amongst several factors, prolonged or inappropriate activation of the complement system and is a significant cause of neurodegeneration. This study investigates for the first time the use of a cheeseboard maze to evaluate cognitive deficits and the effect of VCP on memory processes in 2- and 3-month-old mice that express mutant amyloid precursor protein (APPswe) and mutant presenilin 1 (Ps1dE9) that correspond to a form of early onset AD. A four-phase training schedule was carried out on the cheeseboard maze before intracranial injections of 5 microl of VCP (1.7 microg/microl) or 5 microl saline. Two weeks later the effect of VCP on memory was evaluated. A statistically significant decrease in goal latency in VCP-treated mice than saline-treated transgenic mice in both the first probe and reverse tasks was observed. Similarly, after a second intracranial VCP or saline injection performed 2 months later, the 6.5- and 7.5-month aged VCP-injected mice performed significantly better in goal latency in both second probe and reverse tasks than saline-treated mice. These data also demonstrated that the use of a dry maze is a sensitive technique for distinguishing cognitive measures between non-transgenic and APPswe/PS1De9 transgenic mice at a much earlier stage."
"Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptides appear to modulate various effects of psychostimulant drugs. Injections of CART peptide into the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) inhibit locomotion produced by systemic injections of the psychostimulants cocaine and amphetamine. Intra-NAcc injections of CART peptide also inhibit locomotion produced by microinfusions of dopamine into the NAcc, suggesting that the effects of CART peptides may be due to an interaction with the dopaminergic system in the NAcc. We sought to determine if this inhibitory effect of CART peptide generalizes to other measures of dopaminergic function such as reward/reinforcement by testing the effect of bilateral intra-NAcc CART infusions (0, 0.25, 1.0 and 2.5 microg per side) on cocaine and food self-administration. One group of rats self-administered cocaine (0.75 mg/kg per 140 microl IV infusion) on a progressive ratio schedule. A separate group received 45 mg food pellets on the same progressive ratio schedule. Bilateral intra-NAcc injections of CART peptide dose-dependently decreased the number of cocaine infusions, the breakpoint of cocaine self-administration, and the total number of bar presses on the cocaine-associated lever. There were no effects of CART injections on the breakpoint for food reward. Thus, we conclude that injections of CART into the NAcc appear to functionally antagonize a major site of action for cocaine self-administration in rats."
"The role of the amygdala for the processing of valence and arousal is a matter of debate. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested valence-specific amygdala effects during attentional distraction. Subjects attended to a matching task in the foreground of neutral pictures, and of negative and positive pictures matched for arousal. Negative pictures elicited stronger amygdala activation than neutral or positive pictures, suggesting valence-specific amygdala responses under attentional load."
"The hypothalamus plays especially important roles in various endocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses that guarantee the survival of both the individual and the species. In the rat, a distinct hypothalamic defensive circuit has been defined as critical for integrating predatory threats, raising an important question as to whether this concept could be applied to other prey species. To start addressing this matter, in the present study, we investigated, in another prey species (the mouse), the pattern of hypothalamic Fos immunoreactivity in response to exposure to a predator (a rat, using the Rat Exposure Test). During rat exposure, mice remained concealed in the home chamber for a longer period of time and increased freezing and risk assessment activity. We were able to show that the mouse and the rat present a similar pattern of hypothalamic activation in response to a predator. Of particular note, similar to what has been described for the rat, we observed in the mouse that predator exposure induces a striking activation in the elements of the medial hypothalamic defensive system, namely, the anterior hypothalamic nucleus, the dorsomedial part of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus and the dorsal premammillary nucleus. Moreover, as described for the rat, predator-exposed mice also presented increased Fos levels in the autonomic and parvicellular parts of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, lateral preoptic area and subfornical region of the lateral hypothalamic area. In conclusion, the present data give further support to the concept that a specific hypothalamic defensive circuit should be preserved across different prey species."
"The present study is aimed at evaluating the functional and neuroprotective effect of benzamide, a poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor on delayed neuronal death (DND) in hippocampus CA1 region and memory impairment following global cerebral ischemia (GCI) in a mouse model. GCI was induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCAo) for 20 min followed by reperfusion for 9 days. Postischemic continuous treatment with benzamide (160 mg/kg b w i.p. for 9 days) significantly reversed the GCI-induced anterograde memory impairment in passive avoidance step through and elevated plus maze tasks. The observed memory impairment in vehicle treated ischemia group was found to be well correlated with DND and downregulation of cholinergic muscarinic receptor-1 expression, which was possibly mediated by inflammation and apoptosis, as revealed from inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and number of TUNEL positive neurons in hippocampus CA1 region. It is clear from the present experiment that benzamide treatment significantly decreases the iNOS expression and number of apoptotic neurons and thereby improves the neuronal survival and memory during GCI. Our present findings provide compelling evidence that multiple doses of benzamide treatment is a promising therapeutic approach for cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, which deserves further clinical evaluation."
"The current study reports the impact of different illumination conditions on exploratory activity following global ischemia in rats. Exploratory activity was tested at different post-ischemic intervals under bright (450 lux) or dim (40 lux) light exposure. A 30 min testing period performed 5 days post-reperfusion examined within-session open-field habituation in ischemic and sham-operated animals. Additional animals were tested in the open-field under the two illumination conditions for shorter 10 min tests on days 3, 6, and 9 following reperfusion. Our findings demonstrated illumination-related activity profile in the open-field in ischemic animals. While ischemic rats showed increased activity when tested under bright open-field illumination, reduced activity was observed under dim illumination as compared to sham-operated controls. Further, habituation deficits were not apparent in animals subjected to global ischemia under any illumination condition. Similar behavioral profiles and habituation were observed in ischemic animals when exposed to repetitive open-field tests at days 3, 6, and 9 following reperfusion. CA1 neuronal injury (approximately 75% as compared to sham rats) was comparable in all ischemic groups at day 12 following reperfusion. The present findings suggest that differences in initial behavioral reactivity of sham and ischemic rats to bright versus dimly lighted environments may contribute to differences in open-field exploration reported between these groups. They also challenge the notion that deficits in exploration in ischemic animals are mainly attributable to processes related to habituation, or that hyperactivity represents a reliable predictor of CA1 neuronal injury. These observations may help explain discrepant ischemia-induced behavioral effects reported in the open field."
"The aim of this study was to investigate the role of forebrain serotonin projections in behavioural models with relevance to schizophrenia. Mice received stereotaxic micro-injections of the serotonin neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine into the median raphe nucleus (MRN). Two weeks later, MRN-lesioned mice were hyperactive at baseline and showed enhanced locomotor hyperactivity induced by phencyclidine. In contrast, no lesion effect was observed on the locomotor hyperactivity induced by amphetamine treatment or on prepulse inhibition. Lesioned mice showed a 68% depletion of serotonin in the hippocampus and 31% depletion in the striatum. These data confirm previous studies in rats that selective serotonin depletion in the brain enhances the effect of phencyclidine, but not amphetamine, on locomotor activity. This enhanced action of phencyclidine is likely to be mediated by the absence of serotonin-mediated behavioural inhibition in the hippocampus, leaving the psychostimulant effects of phencyclidine unopposed. Taken together with previous studies in rats, these studies in mice suggest that serotonin release in the dorsal hippocampus constitutes a behavioural inhibitory pathway normally involved in dampening excessive behavioural stimulation. Dysfunction of this pathway could be involved in psychosis and its stimulation could be a potential mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs."
"The purpose of the experiments was to examine the memory-related effects of nicotine using the mouse elevated plus maze. It has been shown that the acute doses of nicotine (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg) significantly decreased the time of transfer latency (TL2) on the retention trial, indicating that nicotine improved memory processes. Similarly, acute doses of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist AM 251 (0.5, 1, 1.5 and 3 mg/kg) significantly decreased TL2 values. WIN55,212-2, a non-selective CB cannabinoid receptor agonist, at any dose tested (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg), did not provoke any effect in this model. Moreover, the acute injection of both WIN55,212-2 (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) and AM 251 (0.25 mg/kg), prior to injections of nicotine (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg), significantly prevented nicotine-induced memory improvement. The results of this study provide clear evidence that the endogenous cannabinoid system participates in the responses induced by nicotine on memory-related behaviour in mice."
"The functionality of adult neocortical circuits can be altered by novel experiences or learning. This functional plasticity appears to rely on changes in the strength of neuronal connections that were established during development. Here we will describe some of our studies in which we have addressed whether structural changes, including the remodeling of axons and dendrites with synapse formation and elimination, could underlie experience-dependent plasticity in the adult neocortex. Using 2-photon laser-scanning microscopes and transgenic mice expressing GFP in a subset of pyramidal cells, we have observed that a small subset of dendritic spines continuously appear and disappear on a daily basis, whereas the majority of spines persists for months. Axonal boutons from different neuronal classes displayed similar behavior, although the extent of remodeling varied. Under baseline conditions, new spines in the barrel cortex were mostly transient and rarely survived for more than a week. However, when every other whisker was trimmed, the generation and loss of persistent spines was enhanced. Ultrastructural reconstruction of previously imaged spines and boutons showed that new spines slowly form synapses. New spines persisting for a few days always had synapses, whereas very young spines often lacked synapses. New synapses were predominantly found on large, multi-synapse boutons, suggesting that spine growth is followed by synapse formation, preferentially on existing boutons. Altogether our data indicate that novel sensory experience drives the stabilization of new spines on subclasses of cortical neurons and promotes the formation of new synapses. These synaptic changes likely underlie experience-dependent functional remodeling of specific neocortical circuits."
"Executive planning, the ability to direct and sustain attention, language and several types of memory may be compromised by conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, cancer, autism, cerebral palsy and Alzheimer's disease. No medical devices are currently available to help restore these cognitive functions. Recent findings about the neurophysiology of these conditions in humans coupled with progress in engineering devices to treat refractory neurological conditions imply that the time has arrived to consider the design and evaluation of a new class of devices. Like their neuromotor counterparts, neurocognitive prostheses might sense or modulate neural function in a non-invasive manner or by means of implanted electrodes. In order to paint a vision for future device development, it is essential to first review what can be achieved using behavioral and external modulatory techniques. While non-invasive approaches might strengthen a patient's remaining intact cognitive abilities, neurocognitive prosthetics comprised of direct brain-computer interfaces could in theory physically reconstitute and augment the substrate of cognition itself."
"It has been repeatedly demonstrated across species that the hippocampus is critical for spatial learning and memory. Consequently, numerous paradigms have been created to study spatial learning in the rodent. Most of these tasks, such as the Morris water maze, 8-arm radial maze, and T-maze, are non-automated procedures. It was our goal to create an automated task in the rodent that is quickly learned, hippocampal-dependent, and minimizes the confounding variables present in most tests measuring hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. To accomplish this, we created a novel search task using a standard operant box fitted with a touch-sensitive computer monitor. Subjects were required to locate an S+ ""hidden"" amongst other identical stimuli on the monitor. In two versions of the task the S+ stayed in the same location within a session but shifted location between sessions. In a third version of the task the S+ was moved to a new location after every 10 trials. It was found that the location of the S+ was quickly acquired each day (within 10 trials), and that the hippocampal-lesion group was impaired when compared to their control cohort. With the benefits inherent in automation, these tasks confer significant advantages over traditional tasks used to study spatial learning and memory in the rodent. When combined with previously developed non-spatial cognitive tests that can also be run in the touch-screen apparatus, the result is a powerful cognitive test battery for the rodent."
"Animals can use both allocentric and egocentric strategies to learn a spatial task. Our results suggest that allocentric cues are more dominant than idiothetic cues in guiding navigation. Animals do not necessarily learn an egocentric strategy automatically, instead they probably hold just one solution to any particular task at a time until forced to learn an alternative strategy. Further, with overtraining animals do not always switch from allocentric to an egocentric learning strategy perhaps challenging suggestions of a stored hierarchy of strategies."
"The exposure to different kinds of stress impacts on the reactive oxygen species production with potential risk to the integrity of the tissues. Psychological or biological stress is responsible for a significant increase in the oxidative stress markers and also for activation of the antioxidant defense system. In this study, we analyzed the relationships between social stress, humoral immune response and glutathione-related antioxidant defenses. Groups of male Swiss mice were subjected to different lengths of social stress exposure (social confrontation) which varied from 1 up to 13 days. As a biological stressor, 10(9) sheep red blood cells (SRBC)/mL were injected by intraperitoneal route. As controls, animals not subjected to social stress and/or injected with vehicle solution were used. The serum samples and the cerebral cortex were collected at 4 h, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 days after the end of social confrontation. The results indicated that the antioxidant enzymes activities were affected by psychological as well as by biological stressor. These alterations were dependent on the timing of stress exposure which resulted in a positive or in a negative correlation between the antibody titres to SRBC and antioxidant enzymes. We also discuss the possible role of SRBC injection in the modulation of the effects of psychosocial stress on antioxidant metabolism."
"We tested whether N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) are critical for the acquisition of trace fear conditioning using conditioned hypoalgesia (CHA), decrease in pain reactivity, as the conditioned response (CR) instead of commonly used freezing. Infusions of the NMDA receptor antagonist, DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) into DH prior to conditioning resulted in impaired CHA, measured with the radiant heat tail flick test, only in the trace-conditioning group when they were tested during the trace interval. The same infusion had no effect on CHA in the delay-conditioned animals. The results support that NMDA receptors in DH are critically involved in associating the CS with the US across a temporal gap. In addition, temporal specificity of the CR was revealed as CHA was induced only in the temporal vicinity of the US used for the training."
"The forelimb movements (skilled reaching) used by rats to reach for a single food pellet to place into the mouth have been used to model many neurological conditions. They have been described as a sequence of oppositions of head-pellet, paw-pellet and pellet-mouth that can be described as movements of the distal portion of body segments in relation to their fixed proximal joints. Movement scoring is difficult, however, because the location and movement of body segments is estimated through the overlying fur and skin, which is pliable and partially obscures movement. Using moderately high-speed cineradiographic filming from lateral, dorsal, and frontal perspectives, the present study describes how forelimb and skeletal bones move during the skilled reaching act. The analysis indicates that: (i) head movements for orienting to food, enabled by the vertical orientation of the rostral spinal cord, are mainly independent of trunk movement, (ii) skilled reaching consists of a sequence of upper arm and extremity movements each involving a number of concurrent limb segment and joint movements and (iii) food pellets are retrieved from the paw using either the incisors and/or tongue. The findings are discussed in relation to the idea that X-ray cinematography is valuable tool for assisting descriptive analysis and can contribute to understanding general principles of the relations between whole body, head, oral, and upper extremity movement."
"Several studies provide evidence that mental imagery is critical for human navigation. However, the contribution of different mental imagery abilities to the individuals' skill of using specific orientation strategies remains unclear. In the present study we assessed a variety of mental imagery skills and investigated their contribution in relationship with the selective individuals' ability of forming and using a mental representation of the environment, namely a cognitive map. Indeed, despite the use of alternative strategies that individuals may adopt while moving along the same well-known route, cognitive maps are critical for orientation since they allow individuals to reach any target location from any place in the environment. We found that the ability to form a cognitive map was related to the specific ability of performing mental rotations of simple geometrical shapes, and the ability to imaging ourselves moving on a map. Other imagery skills such as the ability to generate mental images from memory or the ability of mentally manipulate objects were not correlated with the individuals' performance in forming the cognitive map. Moreover, we revealed gender differences in forming a cognitive map, as well as in performing some of the mental imagery tests. We discuss these findings in order to shed more light on the specific role of mental imagery in human topographical orientation."
"In earlier experiments we have demonstrated that group-housing in a rather impoverished ""standard"" environment can be a crucial stress factor in male C57Bl/6 mice. The present study aimed at investigating the effect of combining a probable genetic vulnerability--postulated by the ""Neurotrophin Hypothesis of Depression""--with the potentially modulating influence of a stressful environment such as ""impoverished"" standard housing conditions. For that purpose mice with a partial deletion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were group-housed under standard and enriched housing conditions and analysed in a well-established test battery for emotional behaviours. Standard group-housing affected emotional behaviour in male and female BDNF heterozygous mice, causing an increase in anxiety, changes in exploration as well as nociception. Providing the animals' cages with supplementary enrichment, however, led to a rescue of emotional alterations, which emphasises the significance of external factors and their relevance for a valid investigation of genetic aspects in these mutants as well as others, which may be examined in terms of stress-responsiveness or emotionality."
"A series of experiments studied the effects of the kappa-opioid receptor agonist U50,488H on consummatory successive negative contrast (cSNC) in rats. In cSNC, previous experience with a 32% sucrose solution leads to greater rejection of 4% sucrose than exclusive experience with 4% sucrose. Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that U50,488H failed to influence cSNC when administered before the first downshifted trial, but either attenuated (1mg/kg) or enhanced (3 and 10mg/kg) cSNC when administered before the second downshift trial. Experiment 3 showed that U50,488H administered immediately after the first downshift trial had no effect on cSNC at the 1mg/kg dose, but tended to increase cSNC at the 3mg/kg dose. However, Experiment 4 suggested that the apparent enhancement of cSNC after 3mg/kg U50 administered posttrial 11 may have reflected the development of a conditioned taste aversion. The trial-selective attenuating effect of the low dose may reflect an anxiolytic-like property of U50,488H."
"Like enucleation, lateral hypothalamic (LH) lesions sever the connection between the retina and the pineal thereby simulating ambient exposure to constant darkness. While LH lesions have been employed to study either circadian function or Parkinson's disease (PD) independently, the application of such lesions to study circadian involvement specifically in this disease has never been attempted. In the present study, unilateral lesions of the LH, which compromise nigro-striatal dopamine (NSD) function, were combined with enucleation ipsilateral or contralateral to the hemisphere where 6-hydroxydopamine was applied. In addition to the observation that hemi-enucleation produced patterns of motor function that were grossly atypical compared to visually intact rats, hemi-enucleation ipsilateral to the side of NSD system denervation produced impairment of horizontal movement, limb retraction, ambulation and spontaneous or l-dopa induced turning. This impairment was more severe than that seen in rats with unilateral 6-OHDA lesions alone. Furthermore, hemi-enucleation contralateral to the side of unilateral NSD system denervation resulted in significantly improved performance on several parameters. While the rate of mortality in rats receiving unilateral 6-OHDA plus ipsilateral enucleation was similar to that occurring after bilateral lesions, it was not accompanied by severe weight loss and wasting that typically occurs in the acute stages of experimental PD. These results demonstrate the importance of the visual and circadian systems in PD and are consistent with reports that identify impaired circadian involvement as a major component in a wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions."
"Despite frequent reports that patients with vestibular dysfunction exhibit an unusually high incidence of anxiety disorders, few studies have investigated the emotional effects of vestibular damage in animals. In this study we investigated the effects of a permanent surgical bilateral vestibular deafferentation (BVD) on the performance of rats in a series of anxiety tests at 3 weeks (3-W), 3 months (3-M) and 5 months (5-M) following the lesion. We used the elevated plus maze (EPM), elevated T maze (ETM), hyponeophagia and social interaction tests. Contrary to expectation, we found that, at 3 and 5M post-op, BVD rats spent more rather than less time on the open arms of the EPM compared to sham controls, and they displayed a lack of learned inhibitory avoidance in the ETM. Compared to sham controls, BVD rats showed no significant difference over the 3 time points in their latencies to eat in a novel situation; however, they did engage in social interaction to a significantly lesser extent. Finally, blood corticosterone levels were not significantly different between BVD and sham rats at 6 months post-op. These results suggest that BVD causes changes in the performance of rats in the EPM and ETM that might reflect emotional changes, or could be due to the cognitive impairment and hyperactivity caused by BVD."
"Functional neuroimaging studies suggest that a lateral network in the brain is associated with the sensory aspects of pain perception while a medial network is associated with affective aspects. The highest concentration of opioid receptors is in the medial network. There is significant evidence that endogenous opioids are central to the experience of pain and analgesia. We applied an integrative multimodal imaging approach during acupuncture. We found functional magnetic resonance imaging signal changes in the orbitofrontal cortex, insula, and pons and [11C]diprenorphine positron emission tomography signal changes in the orbitofrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, insula, thalamus, and anterior cingulate cortex. These findings include brain regions within both the lateral and medial pain networks."
"There have been few comparisons of strains and antidepressants in the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) paradigm in mice. This study was undertaken to determine the influence of such factors using four antidepressants drugs including the tricyclics imipramine (20 mg/(kgday)) and desipramine (10 mg/(kgday)), the tetracyclic maprotiline (20 mg/(kgday)) and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine (10mg/(kgday)) in both Swiss and BALB/c mice. A 6-week UCMS regimen induced deterioration of the coat state and decreased grooming behaviours in the splash test in BALB/c mice but not Swiss mice. The four antidepressants reversed the UCMS-induced effects in BALB/c mice in both measures. However, imipramine and fluoxetine reached significance in the splash test while desipramine and maprotiline displayed only a trend. In conclusion, these results emphasize that BALB/c mice are more sensitive than Swiss mice for studying the effects of the UCMS model as well as for testing antidepressant-like properties."
"We have previously shown that intranigral transplants of immortalized GABAergic cells decrease the number of kainic acid-induced seizures [Castillo CG, Mendoza S, Freed WJ, Giordano M. Intranigral transplants of immortalized GABAergic cells decrease the expression of kainic acid-induced seizures in the rat. Behav Brain Res 2006;171:109-15] in an animal model. In the present study, recurrent spontaneous behavioral seizures were established by repeated systemic injections of this excitotoxin into male Sprague-Dawley rats. After the seizures had been established, cells were transplanted into the substantia nigra. Animals with transplants of control cells (without hGAD67 expression) or with sham transplants showed a death rate of more than 40% over the 12 weeks of observation, whereas in animals with M213-2O CL-4 transplants, the death rate was reduced to less than 20%. The M213-2O CL-4 transplants significantly reduced the percentage of animals showing behavioral seizures; animals with these transplants also showed a lower occurrence of stage V seizures than animals in the other groups. In vivo and in vitro analyses provided evidence that the GABAergic cells show sustained expression of both GAD67 and hGAD67 cDNA, as well as increased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the ventral mesencephalon of transplanted animals. Therefore, transplantation of GABA-producing cells can produce long-term alleviation of behavioral seizures in an animal model."
"One of the key features of schizophrenia is the inability to filter out irrelevant stimuli which consequently leads to stimulus overload. There are different methods which aim at investigating these deficient filter mechanisms; one of these is the learned irrelevance (LIrr) paradigm. LIrr refers to the retardation of associative learning that occurs if the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the unconditioned stimulus (US) are preexposed in an explicitly unpaired manner prior to the establishment of the association between the stimuli. In the present study we used a recently developed computerized within-subject visual LIrr test. We measured 11 drug-naive first-episode schizophrenia patients and compared their performance to that of 17 healthy control subjects. LIrr was observed to be intact in normal individuals but disrupted in drug-naive first-episode schizophrenia patients. After one month elapsed, 5 of the 11 patients and 16 of the 17 control subjects were retested in a follow-up study. By this time, patients had been medicated with antipsychotic drugs for at least 3 weeks. While healthy controls exhibited a robust LIrr effect, patients still failed to show LIrr. Correlations were found between the performance of unmedicated patients and the depression component of the PANSS psychopathology scale."
"Children of depressed parents exhibit high rates of emotion-dysregulation, characterized by excessive withdrawal or approach strategies toward the mother in infancy. The understanding of factors affecting the establishment of these behavioral deficits is limited. The current study utilized two genetic animal models of depression, the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rat strains. In addition, in order to assess the interactive effects of depressive vulnerability and exposure to early life stress, the subjects were raised either in a standard rearing condition or exposed to mild chronic-stress on postnatal days (PND) 2-9. On PND 10-11, an isolation test examined the pups' emotion-regulation. WKY pups produced less separation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) and proximity-seeking behaviors, compared to controls. In addition, WKY pups did not show the expected potentiation effect that was evident in control pups (an increase in USV and pivoting behavior after a short reunion with the dam). FSL pups exhibited less proximity-seeking behaviors compared to controls while showing levels of USV, potentiation of USV, and change in proximity-seeking behaviors that were similar to controls. No differences between the strains were found in self-grooming. The early life chronic-stress paradigm had no effect on the behaviors of the pups, indicating either stress-resilience or a limited effect of the paradigm. Overall, the results tentatively imply a tendency of the WKY and FSL pups towards withdrawal behavior instead of approach-behavior when regulating emotion, with a more pronounced pattern in WKY pups. This behavioral profile is reminiscent of avoidant attachment, a characteristic of many children of depressed parents."
"The behavioural phenotype of mice, lacking CCK(2) receptors, has varied across studies conducted not only in different laboratories, but also across studies published by the same laboratory. The present study was designed to elucidate the phenotype of CCK(2) receptor-deficient mice housed in two different environmental conditions within the same laboratory. Environmental enrichment was used as an alternative environment to standard laboratory conditions. Significant genotype by environment interaction was observed in the plus-maze, hot-plate, restraint-induced analgesia and water maze test. While mice, lacking CCK(2) receptors, housed in standard conditions were more anxious, displayed stronger restraint-induced analgesia and performed worse in the water maze when compared to corresponding wild-type littermates, none of these phenotypes were observed in mice, housed in enriched conditions. By contrast, in the hot-plate test, rota-rod and locomotor activity test a genotype-dependent phenotype was observed in mice housed in enriched, but not in standard conditions. Moreover, the phenotype of CCK(2) receptor-deficient mice established in the hot-plate test and rota-rod was sex-specific. These results suggest that thorough and labour-consuming study of mutation-induced behavioural phenotype is necessary not only in different genetic backgrounds but also the substantial variation of phenotype due to sex- and environment-related factors have to be explored."
"Caffeine, the world's most common psychoactive substance, is used by approximately 90% of North Americans everyday. Little is known, however, about its benefits for memory. Napping has been shown to increase alertness and promote learning on some memory tasks. We directly compared caffeine (200mg) with napping (60-90min) and placebo on three distinct memory processes: declarative verbal memory, procedural motor skills, and perceptual learning. In the verbal task, recall and recognition for unassociated words were tested after a 7h retention period (with a between-session nap or drug intervention). A second, different, word list was administered post-intervention and memory was tested after a 20min retention period. The non-declarative tasks (finger tapping task (FTT) and texture discrimination task (TDT)) were trained before the intervention and then retested afterwards. Naps enhanced recall of words after a 7h and 20min retention interval relative to both caffeine and placebo. Caffeine significantly impaired motor learning compared to placebo and naps. Napping produced robust perceptual learning compared with placebo; however, naps and caffeine were not significantly different. These findings provide evidence of the limited benefits of caffeine for memory improvement compared with napping. We hypothesize that impairment from caffeine may be restricted to tasks that contain explicit information; whereas strictly implicit learning is less compromised."
"It is well established that the serotonergic system modulates social and aggressive behaviors. This study employed field experiments to examine the effects of serotonin on male social structure and behavior in the Puerto Rican coqu&#xed; frog, Eleutherodactylus coqui. This frog displays three types of male behavioral phenotypes: territorial, satellite, and paternal males. Territorial males produce advertisement calls that delineate territories and actively defend these areas. Satellite males typically do not call or defend given areas but are commonly within given conspecific territories. Paternal males brood and defend developing embryos typically in isolation. The objective of this investigation was to focus on territorial and satellite males to determine the impact of the serotonergic system on territorial behavior, specifically with regard to advertisement calling. Serotonin receptor subtype systems 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A/C) were chosen due to their known function in behavioral regulation. Fifteen territorial and satellite males were injected with the 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-OH-DPAT and 15 territorial and satellite males were injected with the 5-HT(2A/C) agonist DOI. Control territorial and satellite males received saline injections. Results indicated that a significant number of territorial males injected with 8-OH-DPAT and DOI failed to emit territorial vocalizations and did not display dominant postural behaviors. It is hypothesized that 8-OH-DPAT and DOI activate 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A/C) receptor systems, respectively, and this activation results in the elimination of territorial behavior resulting in subordinate status. It is concluded that the serotonergic system is essential for the manifestation of male social behavior in E. coqui."
"The present study aimed to demonstrate stochastic resonance (SR) for a visual signal above the threshold by using a two-alternative forced-choice protocol. The percent correct response enhanced at non-zero intensity of noise, while decreased with more intense noise. SR for the suprathreshold signals was found for signals with relatively low intensity above the threshold, and disappeared for more intense signals. These findings show the suprathreshold SR in the visual perception."
"In many species, group cohesion may be the result of a compromise between opposing forces (e.g. predator avoidance and competition for food). However, little empirical data exists on the dynamics of group cohesion. We present moment-to-moment positional data on zebrafish shoals and analyze temporal changes in inter-individual distances. We demonstrate that the distance between shoal members does not settle at any given value, as has previously been assumed, but oscillates with a period between 5 and 15s."
"Circadian rhythms are regulated by clock proteins through post-translational modifications. Indeed, Casein kinase I epsilon (CKIvarepsilon) promotes reversible phosphorylation of PER proteins, and a deficiency in this phosphorylation has been implicated in human sleep disorders. Here, we investigated the CKIvarepsilon S408N polymorphism in a Brazilian population sample. The N408 allele was previously described to be much less frequent in individuals with Delayed Sleep-Phase Syndrome (DSPS), than in the general Japanese population, suggesting a protective function for the allele against the disease. We found that this polymorphism is very rare in the Brazilian population (1.37%), indicating that it has no influence on susceptibility to circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Therefore, it is necessary to account for adaptative influences in genetic background, analyzing different groups with different photoperiods, to validate the effects of this and other polymorphisms on sleep and circadian disorders."
"Tobacco smoking is a leading preventable cause of death in the United States and produces a major health and economic burden. Although the majority of smokers want to quit, few are successful. These data highlight the need for additional research into the neurobiology of tobacco dependence. Addiction to nicotine, the main psychoactive component of tobacco, is influenced by multiple factors that include individual differences in genetic makeup. Twin studies have demonstrated that genetic factors can influence vulnerability to nicotine addiction, and subsequent research has identified genes that may alter sensitivity to nicotine. In humans, genome-wide and candidate gene association studies have demonstrated that genes encoding nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) proteins are associated with multiple smoking phenotypes. Similarly, research in mice has provided evidence that naturally occurring variability in nAChR genes is associated with changes in nicotine sensitivity. Furthermore, the use of genetic knockout mice has allowed researchers to determine the nAChR genes that mediate the effects of nicotine, whereas research with knockin mice has demonstrated that changes to nAChR genes can dramatically alter nicotine sensitivity. This review will examine the genetic factors that alter susceptibility to nicotine addiction, with an emphasis on the genes that encode nAChR proteins."
"We recently found that the interfering peptide Tat-3L4F is able not only to disrupt the protein-protein interaction of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) with the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor in the rat ventral tegmental area (VTA) but also to suppress the conditioned place preference induced by cannabinoid and nicotine without significant effects on anxiety, feeding behavior and motor activity. It is unknown, however, whether Tat-3L4F affects learning and memory. Using a Morris water maze test, we show here that while the cannabinoid HU210 significantly inhibited the performance of spatial learning without significant effects on long-term memory, Tat-3L4F did not induce significant effects on the acquisition and retrieval of spatial memory. These results indicate that Tat-3L4F can suppress the rewarding effects of abused drugs without significant effects on learning and memory."
"Apolipoprotein (apo) E4, one of three human apoE (h-apoE) isoforms, has been identified as a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and for cognitive deficits associated with aging. However, the biological mechanisms involving apoE in learning and memory processes are unclear. A potential isoform-dependent role of apoE in cognitive processes was studied in human apoE targeted-replacement (TR) mice. These mice express either the human apoE3 or apoE4 gene under the control of endogenous murine apoE regulatory sequences, resulting in physiological expression of h-apoE in both a temporal and spatial pattern similar to humans. Male and female apoE3-TR, apoE4-TR, apoE-knockout and C57BL/6J mice (15-18 months) were tested with spatial memory and avoidance conditioning tasks. Compared to apoE3-TR mice, spatial memory in female apoE4-TR mice was impaired based on their poor performances in; (i) the probe test of the water-maze reference memory task, (ii) the water-maze working memory task and (iii) an active avoidance Y-maze task. Retention performance on a passive avoidance task was also impaired in apoE4-TR mice, but not in other genotypes. These deficits in both spatial and avoidance memory tasks may be related to the anatomical and functional abnormalities previously reported in the hippocampus and the amygdala of apoE4-TR mice. We conclude that the apoE4-TR mice provide an excellent model for understanding the mechanisms underlying apoE4-dependent susceptibility to cognitive decline."
"Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a proinflammatory cytokine, is well known as a mediator in early stage inflammatory immune reactions. In recent years, accumulating evidence has shown that IL-6 is concomitant with the occurrence of major depression. However, the identification of the role of IL-6, as either an illness causation or immunotherapy in depression, remains to be further established. In the present study, 5-week old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used along with the forced swim test (FST) and pharmacological techniques. The data show that rats subjected to 3-day intra-amygdala or intra-hippocampus, but not intra-frontal cortex, IL-6 treatments manifested a significant increase in the immobility time (IMT) in the FST. In addition, there was no obvious difference in body temperature between normal and 3-day IL-6 treated rats. Conversely, the rats receiving 3-day intra-amygdala or intra-hippocampus IL-6 inhibitor treatment expressed a significant reduction in IMT in the FST. Moreover, the 3-day IL-6 treated rats treated with SL 327, a blood-brain barrier penetrating MEK inhibitor, prior to the FST showed a significant decrease in the IL-6 elevated IMT. In addition, the results in the Western blot analysis were in parallel with those in the behavioral tests. Taken together, the results show that the immobile behavior of rats in the FST could be modulated by IL-6 via the amygdala or the hippocampus. Furthermore, the Erk1/2 activation in the amygdala or hippocampus seemed to play a role in the IL-6 mediated immobile behavioural alterations of rats in the FST."
"The molecular site of action for volatile anesthetics remains unknown despite many years of study. Members of the K(2P) potassium channel family, whose currents are potentiated by volatile anesthetics have emerged as possible anesthetic targets. In fact, a mouse model in which the gene for TREK-1 (KCNK2) has been inactivated shows resistance to volatile anesthetics. In this study we tested whether inactivation of another member of this ion channel family, KCNK7, in a knockout mouse displayed altered sensitivity to the anesthetizing effect of volatile anesthetics. KCNK7 knockout mice were produced by standard gene inactivation methods. Heterozygous breeding pairs produced animals that were homozygous, heterozygous or wild-type for the inactivated gene. Knockout animals were tested for movement in response to noxious stimulus (tail clamp) under varying concentrations of isoflurane, halothane, and desflurane to define the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) preventing movement. Mice homozygous for inactivated KCNK7 were viable and indistinguishable in weight, general development and behavior from heterozygotes or wild-type littermates. Knockout mice (KCNK7-/-) displayed no difference in MAC for the three volatile anesthetics compared to heterozygous (+/-) or wild-type (+/+) littermates. Because inactivation of KCNK7 does not alter MAC, KCNK7 may play only a minor role in normal CNS function or may have had its function compensated for by other inhibitory mechanisms. Additional studies with transgenic animals will help define the overall role of the K(2P) channels in normal neurophysiology and in volatile anesthetic mechanisms."
"The frontal lobe has an extended maturation period and may be vulnerable to the long-term effects of schizophrenia. We tested this hypothesis by studying the relationship between duration of illness (DoI), grey matter (GM) and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) volume across the whole brain. Sixty-four patients with schizophrenia and 25 healthy controls underwent structural MRI scanning and neuropsychological assessment. We performed regression analyses in patients to examine the relationship between DoI and GM and CSF volumes across the whole brain, and correlations in controls between age and GM or CSF volume of the regions where GM or CSF volumes were associated with DoI in patients. Correlations were also performed between GM volume in the regions associated with DoI and neuropsychological performance. A longer DoI was associated with lower GM volume in the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), right middle frontal cortex, left fusiform gyrus (FG) and left cerebellum (lobule III). Additionally, age was inversely associated with GM volume in the left dorsomedial PFC in patients, and in the left FG and CSF excess near the left cerebellum in healthy controls. Greater GM volume in the left dorsomedial PFC was associated with better working memory, attention and psychomotor speed in patients. Our findings suggest that the right middle frontal cortex is particularly vulnerable to the long-term effect of schizophrenia illness whereas the dorsomedial PFC, FG and cerebellum are affected by both a long DoI and aging. The effect of illness chronicity on GM volume in the left dorsomedial PFC may be extended to brain structure-neuropsychological function relationships."
"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a devastating disease that commonly causes persistent mental disturbances and cognitive deficits. Although studies indicate that oxidative stress and functional deficits occurring after TBI are interrelated events, the knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the development of such cognitive deficits has been limited. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the effect of fluid percussion brain injury (FPI) on a spatial learning task and levels of oxidative stress markers, namely, protein carbonylation and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and Na+,K+-ATPase activity 1 or 3 months after FPI in rats. Statistical analysis revealed that FPI increased the scape latency and mean number of error in Barnes maze test 1 and 3 months after FPI. We also found that protein carbonylation and TBARS content increased in the parietal cortex 1 and 3 months after FPI. In addition, 3 months after FPI, protein carbonylation levels increased both in ipsilateral and contralateral cortices of FPI animals. Indeed, statistical analysis revealed a decrease in Na+,K+-ATPase activity in the cerebral cortex of 1 month FPI animals. Furthermore, the decrease in enzyme activity found 3 months was larger, when compared with 1 month after FPI. These results suggest that cognitive impairment following TBI may result, at least in part, from increase of two oxidative stress markers, protein carbonylation and TBARS that occurs concomitantly to a decrease in Na+,K+-ATPase activity."
"We investigated which brain areas show error-related activity during online motor control while errors occur independently from decision making. During motor tasks, error is a deviation from accuracy or correctness. The effect of the accuracy level on error-related brain activity is unclear. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we investigated how error-related brain activity, especially in fronto-medial wall areas, depended on motor accuracy (MA). Subjects performed a force tracking task with the thumb-index grip: to continuously follow a moving target on a monitor with a cursor which position was controlled by the force amount produced by the fingers. Task difficulty varied with changes in the cursor size (the smaller the cursor, the more difficult the task). We measured the motor accuracy (mean distance between the cursor center and the target) and the error amount (cursor out of the target). Errors were produced when motor accuracy was low and also when motor accuracy was high. For fMRI data processing, we defined a model based on both the error amount and the motor accuracy. The results showed that supplementary motor area (SMA) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activation increased with error and task difficulty independent of the accuracy of motor control. Interestingly, activity in the rostral part of left ACC only increased with error when the motor accuracy was low, independently from task difficulty. These results suggest a clear functional dissociation between dorsal and rostral ACC in error processing which depends on the amount of attentional resources allocated to motor accuracy."
"Sex differences in human spatial navigation are well known. However, the exact strategies that males and females employ in order to navigate successfully around the environment are unclear. While some researchers propose that males prefer environment-centred (allocentric) and females prefer self-centred (egocentric) navigation, these findings have proved difficult to replicate. In the present study we examined eye movements and physiological measures of memory (pupillometry) in order to compare visual scanning of spatial orientation using a human virtual analogue of the Morris Water Maze task. Twelve women and twelve men (average age=24 years) were trained on a visible platform and had to locate an invisible platform over a series of trials. On all but the first trial, participants' eye movements were recorded for 3s and they were asked to orient themselves in the environment. While the behavioural data replicated previous findings of improved spatial performance for males relative to females, distinct sex differences in eye movements were found. Males tended to explore consistently more space early on while females demonstrated initially longer fixation durations and increases in pupil diameter usually associated with memory processing. The eye movement data provides novel insight into differences in navigational strategies between the sexes."
"We have previously demonstrated that anxiety-like behavior assessed in the elevated plus maze does not predict subsequent nicotine consumption in na&#xef;ve adolescent mice. However, an association between anxiety and relapse to drug use has been suggested. In the present study, we investigated whether anxiety levels during nicotine withdrawal predict subsequent nicotine consumption in adolescent mice. C57BL/6 mice were either exposed to (-)-nicotine-free base (nicotine, 50mug/ml) or tap water (water) from postnatal day 30 to 45 (PN30-PN45, priming period). By the end of PN48, all animals were submitted to the elevated plus maze and classified as either having high (HiAnx) or low (LoAnx) levels of anxiety. Immediately after finishing the test, all animals were returned to their home cages and were given a free choice (from PN49 to PN55, free-choice period) between two bottles, one containing a nicotine solution (10mug/ml) and the other tap water. Nicotine consumption during the free-choice period was affected by the priming treatment (nicotine or water) in a way that was dependent on the anxiety level (HiAnx or LoAnx): the nicotine HiAnx group had lower nicotine consumption than the other groups. No differences were observed between the nicotine LoAnx, water HiAnx and water LoAnx groups. The present study provides experimental evidence for the role of anxiety on the regulation of drug consumption. Specifically, our results suggest that the anxiety-like behavior during nicotine withdrawal is associated with subsequent nicotine self-administration."
"Electrical stimulation of the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG) and one of its target structures, the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), produces a typical behaviour in rats consisting of vigorous running and jumping which is known as ""escape behaviour"". Escape behaviour in rodents closely mimics panic attacks in humans. Since electrical stimulation at higher frequencies generally inhibits the stimulated region, we tested in this study the hypothesis that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the dlPAG and VMH at higher frequencies (&gt; 100 Hz) would not induce escape behaviour. More specifically, we evaluated whether experimental DBS could be used to inhibit panic-like behaviour. Rats underwent implantation of DBS-electrodes at the level of the dlPAG and VMH and the effects of various stimulation parameters were assessed. In addition, we studied the neural activation pattern resulting from DBS of the dlPAG and VMH using c-Fos immunohistochemistry. We found that stimulation amplitude is the most important stimulation parameter in the induction of escape behaviour. Remarkably, stimulation frequency (1-300 Hz) had no effect on stimulation-induced escape behaviour and therefore it was not possible to prevent the induction of escape behaviour with higher frequencies. The neuronal activation pattern resulting from dlPAG and VMH DBS was similar. These findings suggest that DBS of the dlPAG and VMH induces panic-related behaviours even at higher frequencies."
"Advances in neuroimaging and genomics provide an unprecedented opportunity to accelerate medication development for nicotine dependence and other addictions. Neuroimaging studies have begun to elucidate the functional neuroanatomy and neurochemistry underlying effects of nicotine and nicotine abstinence. In parallel, genetic studies, including both candidate gene and genome-wide association approaches, are identifying key neurobiological targets and pathways important in addiction to nicotine. To date, only a few neuroimaging studies have explored effects of nicotine or abstinence on brain activity as a function of genotype. Most analyses of genotype are retrospective, resulting in small sample sizes for testing effects of the minor alleles for candidate genes. The purpose of this review is to provide an outline of the work in neuroimaging, genetics, and nicotine dependence, and to explore the potential for increased integration of these approaches to improve nicotine dependence treatment."
"This study investigated the effects of fresh khat extract on learning and memory in CBA mice. A total of 20 male CBA mice, weighing 20-30 g, 5-6 weeks old were administered intraperitoneally with a single daily dose of khat extract for 5 days. The animals were divided into four groups, each comprising five animals. The first three groups were administered three doses (40, 120 and 360 mg/kg body weight) of khat extract, respectively. The last group served as controls and was administered with 0.5 ml normal saline intraperitoneally. The animals were then subjected to Morris water maze (MWM) task performance. Moderate and high doses (120 and 360 mg/kg body weight) of khat extract significantly impaired (P&lt;0.05) while low dose (40 mg/kg body weight) of khat extract did not have a significant effect on CBA mice acquisition learning. The high dose of khat extract significantly (P&lt;0.05) improved while moderate and low doses impaired accuracy for spatial memory of the platform location. This study has shown that khat extract has selective effect on spatial learning and memory, with low dose having no effect on learning but impairing memory, whereas high dose impairs learning but improves memory."
"The heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is a major transcriptional factor that controls the rapid induction of heat shock proteins in response to various environmental stressors. In this study, we globally investigated the effect of HSF1 deficiency on animal behaviors during postnatal growth, and abnormalities in hippocampal neurons and behavior in response to chronic unpredictable stressors (CUS). Mouse behaviors were measured in several behavioral paradigms, including elevated plus maze, open field, closed field, T-maze continuous alternation task (T-CAT), bridge-walking, and wire suspension tests. The hsf1-null mice exhibited reduction in basal anxiety levels and exploratory behavior, and working memory deficits, but normal motor coordination abilities. Chronic unpredictable stressors significantly increased apoptosis in hippocampal CA3 cells in both the hsf1-null and wild-type (WT) mice in the in situ TUNEL staining and induced more anxiety-like behavior in the hsf1-null mice than WT mice in the plus T-maze paradigm. We conclude that hsf1 gene deficiency results in significant abnormalities in mouse basal behaviors and sensitization to chronic unpredictable stressors."
"Converging lines of evidence suggest that oligomers of amyloid-beta play a role in the cognitive impairment characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, but only three studies have provided experimental evidence of such impairment. To provide additional information about the effects of these oligomers on memory, the present study examined the memory of groups of rats exposed to ICV injections of the culture media (CM) of Chinese Hamster Ovary cells that were (7PA2) and were not (CHO-) transfected with a human mutation of amyloid precursor protein that appears to cause early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The 7PA2 CM, which contained concentrations of soluble amyloid-beta oligomers physiologically relevant to those found in human brain, significantly disrupted working memory in rats tested in a radial-arm maze. In contrast, CHO- CM, which did not contain such oligomers, had no effect on memory. The disruptive effects of 7PA2-derived amyloid-beta oligomers, evident 2h after exposure, disappeared within a day. These findings are compared to results from 7PA2 CM tested under a complex procedure thought to measure aspects of executive function. The results confirm the disruptive effects of low-n amyloid-beta oligomers and extend them to a well-established rat model of memory."
"Mouse models for the study of autistic-like behaviors are increasingly needed to test hypotheses about the causes of autism, and to evaluate potential treatments. Both the automated three-chambered social approach test and social transmission of food preference have been proposed as mouse behavioral assays with face validity to diagnostic symptoms of autism, including aberrant reciprocal social interactions and impaired communication. Both assays measure aspects of normal social behavior in the mouse. However, little is known regarding the salient cues present in each assay that elicit normal social approach and communication. To deconstruct the critical components, we focused on delivering discrete social and non-social olfactory and visual cues within the context of each assay. Results indicate that social olfactory cues were sufficient to elicit normal sociability in the three-chambered social approach test. On social transmission of food preference, isolated social olfactory cues were sufficient to induce social investigation, but not sufficient to induce food preference. These findings indicate that olfactory cues are important in mouse social interaction, but that additional sensory cues are necessary in certain situations. The present evidence that both the three-chambered social approach assay and the social transmission of food preference assay require socially relevant cues to elicit normal behavior supports the use of these two assays to investigate autism-related behavioral phenotypes in mice."
"This study investigated the effect of the AMPA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; 2.5 and 5.0 nmol/side) microinjected into the core and shell sub-regions of the accumbens (Acb) nucleus, on food intake and the level of anxiety in female rats. Bilateral microinjections of CNQX (5.0 nmol/side) into the Acb shell (AP, +1.08 to +2.04), but not into the Acb core, induced an anxiolytic-like effect in relation to rats microinjected with vehicle, since the animals exhibited low level of SAP in the feeding test. The anxiolytic-like effect induced by 5.0 nmol CNQX microinjection into the Acb shell may not be ascribed to changes in the motor activity of the animals, because the frequency of locomotion, rearing and grooming remained unchanged after the drug microinjection. However, neither Acb shell nor Acb core CNQX microinjections were able to change the animals food intake along 1h feeding behaviour evaluation. Food intake remained unchanged 24h after the drug microinjections either into the Acb shell or into the Acb core. The data suggest that AMPA receptor blockade in the Acb nucleus may differentially change the ingestive and defensive behaviours in female rats."
"Prior research suggests that prenatal stress, among other effects, can lead to hyper-reactivity of the offspring's hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and alterations in immune function. These stress-induced changes have been linked to a greater propensity to develop depression or anxiety disorders. Furthermore, prenatally stressed offspring may be more susceptible to certain diseases. The immune alterations induced by prenatal stress exposure may disrupt the normal communication between the immune system, endocrine system, and central nervous system, potentially making prenatally stressed individuals more vulnerable to the negative aspects of immune activation, including cytokine-induced cognitive deficits and anxiety. The present study investigated whether prenatal stress would exaggerate these detrimental effects of peripheral immune activation. We hypothesized that prenatally stressed subjects would be hypersensitive to endotoxin administration and would therefore show exaggerated learning deficits, increased anxiety-like behavior, and increased peripheral and central interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) levels. The observed results only partially supported our hypotheses, as prenatally stressed subjects showed evidence, albeit modest, of increased anxiety-like behavior following endotoxin administration relative to non-stressed controls. While prenatal stress exposure or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration independently impaired learning, the data failed to support the hypothesis that prenatally stressed subjects would show exaggerated cognitive deficits, engendered via enhanced peripheral and central IL-1beta levels, following immune activation. Collectively, the data suggest that although prenatal stress exposure led to increases in anxiety-like behavior following endotoxin exposure, it did not appear to increase susceptibility to LPS-induced cognitive decline or elevations in proinflammatory cytokine production."
"The progesterone (P(4)) metabolite and neurosteroid, 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP) acts in the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA) to modulate lordosis of female rats. 3alpha,5alpha-THP also mediates exploratory, affective, and social behaviors; whether actions of 3alpha,5alpha-THP in the VTA mediate these behaviors is of interest. To elucidate the role of the VTA in mediating exploratory, affective, and social behaviors, the present study examined effects of inhibiting 3alpha,5alpha-THP formation in the VTA. Rats received intra-VTA infusions of either PK11195 (400ng/mul, which inhibits de novo 3alpha,5alpha-THP production), indomethacin (10mug/mul, which blocks metabolism of P(4) to 3alpha,5alpha-THP), PK11195 and indomethacin together, or beta-cyclodextrin vehicle and tested on a battery of anxiety (open field and elevated plus maze), social (partner preference and social interaction), and sexual (paced mating) tasks. Compared to rats infused with vehicle to the VTA, rats infused with inhibitor(s) demonstrated significant reductions in central entries in the open field, time on open arms of an elevated plus maze, time spent interacting with a conspecific, initiation and intensity of lordosis, sexual solicitations, and midbrain 3alpha,5alpha-THP levels. These findings suggest that actions of 3alpha,5alpha-THP in the VTA are important for mediating aspects of exploration, anxiety, and social behavior related to mating."
"The cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) is a neuronal anchored glycoprotein that has been associated with distinct functions in the CNS, such as cellular adhesion and differentiation, synaptic plasticity and cognition. Here we investigated the putative involvement of the PrP(C) in the innate fear-induced behavioural reactions in wild-type (WT), PrP(C) knockout (Prnp(0/0)) and the PrP(C) overexpressing Tg-20 mice evoked in a prey versus predator paradigm. The behavioural performance of these mouse strains in olfactory discrimination tasks was also investigated. When confronted with coral snakes, mice from both Prnp(0/0) and Tg-20 strains presented a significant decrease in frequency and duration of defensive attention and risk assessment, compared to WT mice. Tg-20 mice presented decreased frequency of escape responses, increased exploratory behaviour, and enhancement of interaction with the snake, suggesting a robust fearlessness caused by PrP(C) overexpression. Interestingly, there was also a discrete decrease in the attentional defensive response (decreased frequency of defensive alertness) in Prnp(0/0) mice in the presence of coral snakes. Moreover, Tg-20 mice presented an increased exploration of novel environment and odors. The present findings indicate that the PrP(C) overexpression causes hyperactivity, fearlessness, and increased preference for visual, tactile and olfactory stimuli-associated novelty, and that the PrP(c) deficiency might lead to attention deficits. These results suggest that PrP(c) exerts an important role in the modulation of innate fear and novelty-induced exploration."
"Current anxiety tests do not provide, individually, a pure and complete picture of an animal's emotional profile. Therefore, many authors test their experimental hypotheses using a series of anxiety-related tests, which are thought to reflect different facets of emotionality. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential usefulness of integrating three widely used behavioral tests, the open field (OF), elevated plus maze (EPM), and light/dark box (LDB), to assess a wider range of emotional and non-emotional behaviors within one single trial. A protocol was developed where rats could freely explore an OF that was physically connected to an EPM and a LDB during 15min. Classical anxiety- and locomotion-related behaviors from each test were measured. Lewis and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) inbred strains, known to present genetic differences in each of the individual tests, differed for all anxiety-related behaviors from the combined apparatus. Factor analyses revealed that similar anxiety- and locomotion-related factors were produced by the three tests applied either separately or in combination. Under both conditions, each test produced its own anxiety-related factor. Two benzodiazepines, chlordiazepoxide (at 5 and 10mg/kg) and midazolam (at 0.75mg/kg), facilitated the approach towards the EPM open arms, whereas pentylenetetrazole (10mg/kg) specifically inhibited exploration of the three aversive areas (OF center, EPM open arms, LDB light compartment). Together, these results suggest that the new integrated apparatus may contribute to the study of anxiety, by providing a rapid, comprehensive and reliable method of assessing emotionality-related behaviors and its underlying components."
"A 3-week chronic mild stress (CMS) protocol decreased sucrose preference of rats and increased immobility in the forced swim test. It also induced social avoidance and increased grooming, but acted as if reducing anxiety in the plus-maze. Sucrose preference and social avoidance, but not other measures of the behaviour, showed significant correlation. We conclude that CMS-induced depression-like behaviour is associated with social avoidance, a seemingly anxiety-related measure, but not with other anxiety-like traits in rats."
"Cannabinoid CB1 inverse agonists such as rimonabant and AM 251 hold therapeutic promise as appetite suppressants, but the extent to which non-motivational factors contribute to their anorectic effects is not fully known. Examination of the behavioral satiety sequence (BSS) in rats, the orderly progression from eating to post-prandial grooming and then resting, has revealed that these compounds preserve the order of events but differ markedly from natural satiation. The most notable difference is that grooming (particularly scratching) is profoundly enhanced at anorectic doses, while eating and resting are diminished, raising the possibility that the anorectic effect is simply secondary to the grooming effect. In the current design, the neutral CB1 antagonist AM 4113, which has been found to lack some of the undesirable effects of AM 251, produced nearly identical effects on the BSS as AM 251. The possibility that competition from enhanced grooming could account for the anorectic effect of AM 4113 was examined by yoking the pattern of disruptions caused by grooming in the AM 4113-treated group to forced locomotion in a different group fed in a modified running wheel. This response competition did not significantly reduce food intake. It was concluded that AM 4113, a CB1 neutral antagonist, produces the same effects on the BSS as AM 251, but that response competition from enhanced grooming may not be a sufficient explanation for the anorectic effects of CB1 antagonists/inverse agonists."
"Animal studies and pharmacological studies in man have suggested that the serotonin 5-HT(1A) receptor may serve as a biomarker for cognitive functioning and a target for treatment of cognitive impairment. Consistent findings in man have nonetheless hitherto remained sparse. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the 5-HT(1A) receptor in patients with Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and depression implicate an alteration in 5-HT(1A) receptor binding compared to control subjects, but it is yet unknown whether these alterations are related to the cognitive impairment associated with these disorders. Pharmacological challenge studies using 5-HT(1A) agonism and antagonism to manipulate the serotonin system support involvement of the 5-HT(1A) receptor in human cognition, mainly in verbal memory functioning. However, the effect varies across studies and it remains unclear if the 5-HT(1A) receptor serves as a validated target for treatment of cognitive deficits. This lack of confirmation of experimental preclinical data, calls for increased efforts in translational research. Molecular imaging techniques such as PET, holds the potential to facilitate translational neuroscience by confirming observations from animal models in man, and aid development of validated animal models of use for advancement of pharmacological treatment. Furthermore, in combination with molecular genetics, molecular imaging may suggest novel strategies for prevention and intervention, based on an understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in disease pathogenesis of major neuropsychiatric disorder and associated cognitive impairment."
"Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), an active ingredient of turmeric, obtained from the powdered rhizomes of Curcuma longa Linn., has been traditionally recognized for treatment of several diseases. To evaluate the potential clinical use of curcumin, we determined the dose dependence of its effects in the therapeutic window and of the neuroprotective efficacy in a cerebral thromboembolic model of the rat. Rats were subjected to occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAo) by a thrombus and treated with different doses of curcumin or the vehicle at 4h after ischemia. The animals were assessed after 24h for motor performance and neurological deficit. The rats were sacrificed immediately afterwards for evaluation of infarct, edema volume, estimation of nitrate and nitrite levels, neutrophil infiltration and levels of GSH and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in brain tissue. Curcumin reduced in a dose-dependent manner the ischemia-induced cerebral infarct and edema volume and attenuated neurological deficits observed after 24h. Curcumin reduced post-ischemic brain neutrophil infiltration, nitrate and nitrite levels and ameliorated the loss of GSH-Px and tends to increase the GSH levels but not significantly in the brain tissue. Neuronal levels of reactive oxygen species, peroxynitrite, and nitric oxide were lowered and in brain cryosections inducible nitric oxide synthase expression were significantly inhibited after treatment with curcumin. The present study is the first evidence of effectiveness of curcumin when given 4h post-ischemia in the rat thromboembolic stroke models, as it reduces infarct volume, ameliorates the sensory motor function and significantly attenuated the nitrosative stress."
"The purpose of this study was to establish the relationship between the hemodynamic response of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and individual differences in cognitive control, as measured by a color-word interference task. Twenty-five healthy volunteers were observed through functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) while performing a modified Stroop paradigm. Mean concentration levels of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) were correlated with behavioral performance in the conflict task. Those with shorter reaction times had higher levels of oxy-Hb concentration in superior dorsolateral PFC. Our results are the first to show a positive correlation between behavioral performance and oxy-Hb levels in superior dorsolateral PFC in a cognitive conflict task. These results suggest that the availability of oxygen in the superior PFC, possibly linked to an increase in metabolism, may be related to attention level and effectiveness of cognitive control."
"The neonatal hippocampus lesion thought to model schizophrenia should show the same modifications in behavioural tests as other models, especially pharmacological models, namely decreased latent inhibition, blocking and overshadowing. The present study is set out to evaluate overshadowing in order to complement our previous studies, which had tested latent inhibition. ""Overshadowing"" refers to the decreased conditioning that occurs when the to-be-conditioned stimulus is combined with another stimulus at the conditioning stage. We used the same two Pavlovian conditioning paradigms as in our previous works, namely conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and conditioned emotional response (CER). A sweet taste overshadowed a salty conditioned stimulus, and a tone overshadowed a flashing light. Totally different stimuli were used to counter possible sensory biases. The protocols were validated with two groups of Sprague Dawley rats. The same two protocols were then applied to a cohort of rats whose ventral hippocampus had been destroyed when they were 7days old. Only rats with extended ventral hippocampus lesions were included. The overall effect of Pavlovian conditioning was attenuated, significantly so in the conditioned emotional response paradigm, but overshadowing appeared not to be modified in either the conditioned emotional response or the conditioned taste aversion paradigm."
"We intended to clarify whether pentobarbital-induced sleep in rats is affected during cocaine withdrawal and whether GABAergic systems are involved in this sleep. Cocaine (20mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously (s.c.) to rats once per day for 6 days. Pentobarbital (42mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to the rats 1 day (acute withdrawal), 8 days (subacute withdrawal), or 14 days (subchronic withdrawal) after withdrawal from cocaine. All rats were fasted for 24h prior to the pentobarbital injection. Pentobarbital-induced sleeping time was significantly increased during both acute and subacute withdrawal, while sleeping onset latency was not affected. However, sleeping time recovered to normal 14 days after withdrawal. Protein levels of GABAA receptor gamma-subunits and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) were increased in both acute and subacute cocaine withdrawal in the hypothalamus, but were normal after 14 days of withdrawal. These results indicate that pentobarbital-induced sleeping time in cocaine withdrawal is transiently increased. Hypersomnia in cocaine withdrawal might be influenced by functional changes in the GABAergic systems."
"Mouse models of lysosomal storage diseases, including Sandhoff disease, are frequently employed to test therapies directed at the central nervous system. We backbred such mice and conducted a behavioral test battery which included sensorimotor and cognitive assessments. This is the first report of short-term memory deficits in a murine model of Sandhoff disease. We also document early onset of motor deficits using the balance beam test."
"There have been several studies suggesting that sex hormones are involved in characterization of human mental function and behaviour. Recently, it has been reported that the -34T/C polymorphism of cytochrome P450 17 (CYP17) gene affects sex hormone dispositions. Therefore, it is possible that the CYP17 -34T/C polymorphism affects personality traits. In the present study, the association of this genetic polymorphism with personality traits was examined in 595 healthy Japanese. Personality traits were assessed by the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), and the CYP17 -34T/C polymorphism was detected by a PCR-RFLP method. In males, the scores of novelty seeking, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence were higher in the group with the C allele than in that without this allele. In females, none of the seven TCI dimensions was different between the two genotype groups. The present study thus suggests that the -34T/C polymorphism of the CYP17 gene affects personality traits of healthy males, but not females, and this gender-dependent effect may be mediated by the action of sex hormones such as estradiol and testosterone."
"Infection during infancy, a time of critical neural development, may have long-term implications. Infection or exposure to an immune stimulus such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) early in life leads to alterations in the reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and febrile response in adulthood. Relatively few studies have assessed the behavioral and cognitive alterations induced by perinatal immune challenge. The data indicate that neonatal immune activation may alter adulthood behavior with, or sometimes without, subsequent adulthood exposure, depending on the study. The current study investigated the behavioral effects and IL-1beta transcription following intraperitoneal LPS administration on postnatal days (PNDs) 4 and 5, and subsequent LPS or saline administration in adulthood. Alterations in anxiety, motor behavior, and learning were assessed in male and female subjects. The results indicate that neonatal endotoxin exposure attenuated the LPS-induced decrease in motor behavior in female, but not male, subjects. Furthermore, perinatal immune activation disrupted avoidance learning in male, but not female, subjects in the absence of adulthood LPS administration. In addition, for male subjects, neonatal LPS exposure diminished central IL-1beta gene transcription following adulthood LPS administration. These findings indicate that perinatal endotoxin exposure may lead to alterations in the behavioral response to adulthood LPS administration, and provide evidence that early immune activation alone may trigger alterations in adulthood learning ability."
"Chronic high levels of corticosterone (CORT) are known to facilitate learning and memory of aversive events. Whether this effect of chronic CORT also generalizes to unconditioned or unlearned fear behavior is not known. The present study investigated whether high levels of chronic CORT enhance unconditioned fear to a predator odor, trimethylthiazoline (TMT), an innate fear stimulus to rodents. TMT induces a dose-related freezing response, a prototypical behavior to fearful stimuli, in rats. The first experiment demonstrated that dose-related freezing to repeated exposures of TMT does not habituate, sensitize or produce contextually conditioned fear, and therefore can be used to measure the effects of chronic CORT on unconditioned fear to repeated exposures of TMT. In Experiment 2, 21-day release corticosterone pellets (200mg) were implanted subcutaneously in male, Sprague-Dawley rats. Control rats received sham implantation. On days when TMT was not present, chronic CORT rats froze significantly more than sham rats. However, while TMT-induced freezing in both chronic CORT and sham rats, freezing during exposure to TMT was not further enhanced in chronic CORT rats. Thus, chronic CORT appears to increase fear as measured by freezing, possibly by enhancing vigilance, but does not facilitate fear behavior induced by the innate fear stimulus, TMT."
"In the present study, the effects of intra-locus coeruleus (LC) injection of GABA(B) receptor-interacting agents on naloxone-induced withdrawal signs of morphine-dependent rats were examined. The GABA(B) receptor agonist and antagonists were injected 5 min prior to naloxone injection. Baclofen, a GABA(B) receptor agonist, decreased the TWS in a dose-dependent manner but CGP35348, a GABA(B) receptor antagonist, alone had no effect. On the other hand, baclofen effects were reversed by CGP35348. It may be concluded that activation of GABA(B) receptor mechanisms in the LC reduces precipitated withdrawal symptoms from chronic morphine treatment."
"Numerous findings suggest that drug seeking and ingestive behaviors share common neurobiological mechanisms, but the relevant pathways are unknown. Dietary manipulations result in changes in endocrine the and/or neuropeptide signals, such as the hormones leptin and ghrelin, which are dynamically linked to energy balance and the regulation of feeding behavior. We have recently demonstrated that food deprivation-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking can be blocked with leptin, and others have suggested a role for ghrelin in drug-related behaviors. The feeding-relevant effects of leptin and ghrelin involve the inhibition or activation, respectively, of neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AGRP) neurons in the hypothalamus. However, the effects of NPY, a highly potent orexigenic peptide, on drug-related behaviors have not been thoroughly studied. Here we examined the effect of acute NPY administration on the rate of heroin self-administration and the reinstatement of extinguished heroin-seeking behavior. Heroin intake (0.05mg/kg/infusion) was tested using a self-administration procedure (FR-1), 10-min post-NPY injections (0.0, 4.0, and 10microg/rat, ICV). In a different group of rats, NPY-induced reinstatement (0.0, 4.0, and 10microg/rat, ICV) of extinguished heroin seeking was assessed. NPY injections increased on-going heroin self-administration, and induced a reinstatement of extinguished heroin-seeking behavior. These findings suggest that NPY can modulate the rewarding and conditioned reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse."
"Neurotensin plays a role in regulating feeding behavior. Central injection of neurotensin reduces food intake and the anorectic effect of neurotensin is mediated through neurotensin receptor 1 (Ntsr1). Ntsr1-deficient mice are characterized by mild hyperphagia and overweight without hyperleptinemia. The mechanism by which Ntsr1-deficient mice develop these metabolic abnormalities is not well understood. Leptin, secreted by adipocytes, regulates food intake by acting on hypothalamic neurons including neurotensin-producing neurons. Since the anorectic effect of leptin is blocked by neurotensin receptor antagonist, we hypothesized that the anorectic effect of leptin is mediated through Ntsr1 in the central nervous system and that decreased sensitivity to the anorectic effect of leptin contributes to metabolic perturbations in Ntsr1-deficient mice. To address this hypothesis, we examined the effect of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of leptin on food intake in Ntsr1-deficient mice. A single i.c.v. injection of leptin caused robust reductions in food intake in wild-type mice. These effects were markedly attenuated in Ntsr1-deficient mice. These data are consistent with our hypothesis that the anorectic effect of leptin is at least partly mediated through central Ntsr1 and that the leptin-Ntsr1 signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of food intake. Our data also suggest that the lack of Ntsr1 reduces sensitivity to the anorectic action of leptin, causing hyperphagia and abnormal weight gain."
"An early (i.e., 15min) single systemic administration of the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT enhances behavioral recovery after experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, acute administration of pharmacotherapies after TBI may be clinically challenging and thus the present study sought to investigate the potential efficacy of a delayed and chronic 8-OH-DPAT treatment regimen. Forty-eight isoflurane-anesthetized adult male rats received either a controlled cortical impact or sham injury and beginning 24h later were administered 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 or 0.5mg/kg) or saline vehicle (1.0mL/kg) intraperitoneally once daily until all behavioral assessments were completed. Neurobehavior was assessed by motor and cognitive tests on post-operative days 1-5 and 14-19, respectively. The lower dose of 8-OH-DPAT (0.1mg/kg) enhanced motor performance, acquisition of spatial learning, and memory retention vs. both the higher dose (0.5mg/kg) and vehicle treatment (p&lt;0.05). These data replicate previous findings from our laboratory showing that 8-OH-DPAT improves neurobehavior after TBI, and extend those results by demonstrating that the benefits can be achieved even when treatment is withheld for 24h. A delayed and chronic treatment regimen may be more clinically feasible."
"Many flavonoids extracted from nature plants have been reported to exert antidepressant-like effect in animal studies. The present study was designed to observe the effects of liquiritin, a flavone compound derived from Glycyrrhiza uralensis, on the behaviors of chronic variable stress induced depression model rats and to explore the possible association between its antidepressant-like effect and antioxidative activity by measuring erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) level of the experimental animals. With the exposure to stressor once daily for consecutive 5 weeks, liquiritin and a positive control drug fluoxetine were administered via gastric intubation to rats once daily for consecutive 3 weeks from the 3rd week. The results showed that CVS reduced open-field activity and sucrose consumption significantly, but increased immobility time in forced swimming test. Treatment of liquiritin could effectively reverse alteration in immobility time and sucrose consumption but did not show significant effect on open-field activity. Moreover, liquiritin could increase SOD activity, inhibit lipid peroxidation, and lessen production of MDA, while fluoxetine did not. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated a potential antidepressant-like effect of liquiritin treatment on chronic variable stress induced depression model rats, which might be related to defense of liquiritin against oxidative stress."
"The purpose of this study was to investigate the temporal pattern of NMDA receptors antagonist-MK-801 on motor behaviour parameters in gerbils submitted to different duration of global cerebral ischemia. The common carotid arteries of gerbils were occluded for 5, 10 or 15min. Gerbils were given MK-801 (3mg/kg i.p.) or saline immediately after the occlusion in normothermic conditions prior to testing. Motor activity was registered 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after reperfusion during 60min by open field test. At the same time, the effect of NMDA receptor blockade was followed in vivo by monitoring the neurological status of whole animals or at the cellular level by standard light and confocal microscopy on brain slices. Post-ischemic gerbils quickly developed hypermotor response with the most intensity in animals submitted to 15min ischemia. MK-801 administrated immediately after ischemia significantly decreased this hyperactivity. In all ischemic-treated animals, behavioural suppression by MK-801 was observed already 1 day after occlusion and was lasting as far as observed ischemia-dependent hypermotor responses. Beneficial effect of MK-801 was also confirmed by morphological and neurological status data. These findings suggest that sustained ischemia-induced hyperactivity is related to abnormalities in NMDA glutamatergic function, as well as its manifestation could be completely abolished by NMDA receptor blockade immediately after ischemic insult."
"Cytokine-induced CNS inflammation has been theorized to contribute to cognitive dysfunction in sickness and neurodegenerative disease. We investigated the effects of systemic endotoxin-induced acute immune activation and inflammation on working memory and attention functions in pigeons assessed through two variations of an operant symbolic matching-to-sample (SMTS) task, employing doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) sufficient to induce fever. LPS produced moderate impairments in comparison to saline on the SMTS task designed to measure visual vigilance and attention, but the impairments were not as marked as those produced by chlordiazepoxide (CDP) which is known to disrupt attention. In contrast, LPS had no significant effect on short-term working memory performance compared to saline, while scopolamine, a cholinergic antagonist known to disrupt working memory, did impair performance. The results have implications for the cognitive impairments seen in illnesses characterized by chronic cytokine activation (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) as well as illnesses treated with cytokines (e.g., multiple sclerosis) suggesting that some cognitive failures attributed to working memory impairments per se may better be attributed to prior attention impairments."
"We compared acute and chronic antinociceptive effects of morphine in animals with high reactivity (HR) vs. low reactivity (LR) to novelty. Antinociception was assessed by tail-flick test. Rats were i.p. injected with either saline or morphine (1.5 or 3mg/kg) every 12h for 7 days according to the treatment group. On day 1 of the experiment, LR animals in the 1.5mg/kg morphine group showed significantly higher tail-flick latency than HR. Moreover, significant tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine at the used doses was observed in LR but not HR animals. However, effects of chronic morphine treatment on tail-flick latency in rat groups with similar morphine-induced acute antinociception were undistinguishable. The difference in tail-flick latency between HR and LR rats observed after acute 1.5mg/kg morphine injection was eliminated if beta-funaltrexamine (3mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 24h before the test, an indication that mu opioid receptors are responsible for the difference observed. Studies to anatomically characterize the difference in the acute analgesic effect of morphine in HR vs. LR animals did not however yield any significant difference in mu opioid receptor mRNA levels in locus coeruleus (LC), ventral periaqueductal gray (vPAG), nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) and nucleus reticularis paragigantocellularis (NRPG) between these two groups of animals. In conclusion, our results show that differences in novelty-seeking behavior can predict inter-individual variability in morphine-induced antinociception in rats. Such variability is dependent upon activation of mu opioid receptors, but does not correlate with mu opioid receptor expression in LC, vPAG or ventral medulla."
"Recent evidence indicates that adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonists hold therapeutic potential for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). A study on the novel adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptor dual antagonist 5-[5-amino-3-(4-fluorophenyl)pyrazin-2-yl]-1-isopropylpyridine-2(1H)-one (ASP5854) showed it to be effective in various rodents models of PD and cognition. In the present study, we further investigated the potential of ASP5854 as an anti-PD drug using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated common marmosets, which is a highly predictive model of clinical efficacy in PD, and compared its effect with those of existing anti-PD drugs. ASP5854 significantly and dose-dependently improved the total motor disability score for 7h at doses higher than 1mg/kg, and significantly increased total locomotor activity at doses higher than 0.1mg/kg without adverse effects. l-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine+benserazide and bromocriptine also significantly improved the motor disability score and the hypolocomotion caused by MPTP treatment in a dose-dependent fashion. This amelioration was significant at 32+8 and 10-32 mg/kg, respectively, although bromocriptine induced severe emesis. Trihexiphenidyl also significantly improved the total motor disability score at doses of 10-32 mg/kg; however, while a significant increase in the total locomotor activity was observed at 10mg/kg, the drug induced ataxia-like behavior at 32 mg/kg. On the other hand, neither selegiline nor amantadine improved the total motor disability and hypolocomotion. These data substantiate the evidence that the novel adenosine antagonist ASP5854 exerts comparable anti-PD activity with existing anti-PD drugs, which indicates that ASP5854 might have potential to ameliorate motor deficits in PD."
"The present study was to investigate the processing of pleasant smell and taste stimuli by non-linear EEG measures. Point correlation dimension (PD2i) has been used for studying the local, and synchronization likelihood (SL) the global dynamical organization. Nine healthy subjects participated in this study. After a baseline period of 30s the patients were given a perfume cap or a chocolate taste for 30s. The analysis was performed off-line on 16 channels. After smell stimulation an immediate bilateral but short response was seen. First a decrease and afterwards an increase were found in the mean PD2i. In contrast, the taste stimulation resulted in a later reaction mainly on the right side. The SL in the slow alpha band decreased during the first 15s after both stimulations. In the second 15s, however, a remarkable SL increase was seen mainly in the 7-14Hz and in every frequency band. The decreased mean PD2i and SL values could be interpreted by the simplified network preparation to cognitive data processing. The PD2i and SL methods detected subtle dynamical changes during olfactory and gustatory processes suitable for collection normative database to pathological conditions."
"A human neuronal cell line, hNT2.19, which secretes serotonin (5-HT) after differentiation, was used as a transplant source to improve motor dysfunction following severe contusive spinal cord injury (SCI). Also, environmental enrichment (EE) was added to the interspinal transplant treatment paradigm. Motor testing was performed weekly before and following SCI, with and without EE and/or cell transplant conditions. Motor recovery was maximal when both cell transplant and EE were used. Individual treatment paradigms also significantly improved foot rotation and reduced footfall errors but not stride length or base of support dysfunction. This recovery of motor function after SCI suggests that the combinatory use of serotonergic hNT2.19 cell grafts plus EE is a meaningful strategy to modestly improve motor dysfunction that accompanies contusive SCI."
"Operant conditioning of antennal movements in honey bees was used to investigate whether learned changes on one antenna influence antennal movements of the contralateral antenna. Conditioning of the right antenna did not alter antennal movements of the left antenna and subsequent conditioning of the left antenna did not abolish the previously learned change in the right antenna. Thus, the antennal systems on each side are largely independent from each other."
"The present study was designed to explore the possible nitric oxide mechanism in protective effect of venlafaxine in sleep deprivation in mice. Laca mice were sleep deprived for period of 72 h using grid suspended over water method. Venlafaxine (2.5, 5 and 10mg/kg, ip), l-arginine (50mg/kg, ip), l-NAME (10mg/kg, ip) and methylene blue (10mg/kg, ip) were administered for 5 days, starting 2 days before 72-h sleep deprivation. Various behavioral tests (plus maze, zero maze, mirror chamber tests for anxiety, and actophotometer test) followed by oxidative stress parameters (malondialdehyde level, glutathione, catalase, nitrite and protein) were assessed. The present study showed that venlafaxine (5 and 10mg/kg, ip) drug treatment significantly reversed 72-h sleep deprivation caused anxiety like behavior, impairment in locomotor activity and oxidative damage (increased lipid peroxidation and nitrite levels and depleted reduced glutathione and catalase activity) as compared to control. l-NAME (10mg/kg) and methylene blue (10mg/kg) pretreatment with lower dose of venlafaxine (5mg/kg) potentiated the protective effect of venlafaxine (5mg/kg). However, l-arginine (50mg/kg) pretreatment with venlafaxine (5mg/kg) reversed the protective effect of venlafaxine. Results of present study suggest that nitric oxide mechanism is involved in the protective effect of venlafaxine against sleep-deprivation-induced behavior alteration and oxidative damage in mice."
"Since the late eighties of the last century, when the so-called serial reaction time (SRT) task was first presented, analysis of sequential learning and performance has developed into a prosperous area of neurocognitive research in human subjects and non-human primates. In more recent years, rodent implementations of SRT tasks have become available, which will be summarized here and discussed with respect to their advantages, but also to their methodological and theoretical drawbacks. Then, a review of new neurobiological findings with such rodent tasks will be provided, that will be embedded into the existing theoretical framework, originally obtained from the work with primate species. Among others, this review will show that rodent SRT tasks allow actualizing and thus, studying many psychological features of human sequential tasks, for example, cognitive complexity of sequences. Since these rodent tasks can be used for a number of neuronal analyses, it is assumed that they will provide important insights for the neural mechanisms underlying such cognitive functions."
"Several neurotransmitters, including glutamate and serotonin, modulate defensive behaviors related to anxiety in the rat dorsal periaqueductal gray (PAG). Although both glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) and serotonin type 1-A (5-HT(1A)) receptors have been shown to interfere with these subtle responses, such as inhibitory avoidance, a possible interaction between them remains to be examined. To address this issue, the present study investigated whether the activation or the blockage of 5-HT(1A) receptors located in the dorsal PAG would interact with NMDA function in animals exposed to the elevated plus-maze task. The effect of the NMDA (25 pmol) was evaluated in rats pretreated with the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY-100135 (2.0 or 5.0 nmol). In addition, the effect of the NMDA (100 pmol) was evaluated in rats pretreated with the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (2.0 or 8.0 nmol). Intra-dorsal PAG injection of NMDA (25 pmol) increased inhibitory avoidance behavior. This anxiogenic-like effect of the NMDA was counteracted by the pretreatment with WAY-100135 (5.0 nmol). Although 100 pmol of NMDA failed to increase inhibitory avoidance in the vehicle-pretreated group, in rats pretreated with 8-OH-DPAT this NMDA dose produced an anxiogenic-like effect. These results suggest that 5-HT(1A) and NMDA receptors interact in the dorsal PAG to modulate the anxiety-related behavior."
"In the Morris water maze (MWM) task, proprioceptive information is likely to have a poor accuracy due to movement inertia. Hence, in this condition, dynamic visual information providing information on linear and angular acceleration would play a critical role in spatial navigation. To investigate this assumption we compared rat's spatial performance in the MWM and in the homing hole board (HB) tasks using a 1.5 Hz stroboscopic illumination. In the MWM, rats trained in the stroboscopic condition needed more time than those trained in a continuous light condition to reach the hidden platform. They expressed also little accuracy during the probe trial. In the HB task, in contrast, place learning remained unaffected by the stroboscopic light condition. The deficit in the MWM was thus complete, affecting both escape latency and discrimination of the reinforced area, and was thus task specific. This dissociation confirms that dynamic visual information is crucial to spatial navigation in the MWM whereas spatial navigation on solid ground is mediated by a multisensory integration, and thus less dependent on visual information."
"The aim of the present study was to determine the impact of aging on learning and retrieval of taste-potentiated odor aversion (TPOA). TPOA, which involves processing of odor, gustatory, and visceral cues, is a particular form of learning important to food selection. The experiment was carried out on young (1.5 month), adult (12 months), and old (20-24 months) rats. To determine whether the possible effects of aging on TPOA were related or not to general memory alterations, mnesic abilities of the rats were previously evaluated by submitting the animals to object recognition, olfactory discrimination, and spatial homing task. It was noted that the young, the adult, and the old rats were able to learn and to retrieve TPOA whatever the stimulus - either odor or taste - used to elicit retrieval. Interestingly, it can be underlined that the rejection of the odor stimulus only was even slightly increasing with the rat age. Thus, TPOA which is important in food selection and in animal survival is spared during aging while mnesic deficits were observed in the other behavioral tasks tested according to the task requirement."
"Rett syndrome (RTT) is an autistic spectrum developmental disorder associated with mutations in the X-linked Mecp2 gene, and severe behavioural and neuropathological deficits. In a mouse model of RTT (Mecp2(1lox)), we examined whether environmental enrichment (EE) alters behavioural performance and regional brain volume. At weaning, Mecp2(1lox) and control mice were assigned to enriched or standard housing. From postnatal day 29 to 43, mice were subjected to behavioural tasks measuring motor and cognitive performance. At postnatal day 44, volumes of whole brain, cerebellum, ventricles, and motor cortex were measured using magnetic resonance imaging. EE provided subtle improvements to locomotor activity and contextual fear conditioning in Mecp2(1lox) mice. Additionally, EE reduced ventricular volumes, which correlated with improved locomotor activity, suggesting that neuroanatomical changes contribute to improved behaviour. Our results suggest that post-weaning EE may provide a non-invasive palliative treatment for RTT."
"The present experiment was designed with the goal of studying the partial reinforcement extinction effect (PREE) in female inbred Roman high- (RHA-I) and low-avoidance (RLA-I) rats. Two groups of RHA-I and two of RLA-I food-deprived animals were placed in a straight alley where they were partially or continuously reinforced. Once the animals reached the acquisition criterion, they were exposed to an extinction phase where the reinforcement was omitted. During the extinction phase RHA-I animals continuously reinforced during acquisition exhibited more resistance to extinction than their RLA-I counterparts, whereas only RLA-I rats partially reinforced during acquisition showed an increased resistance to extinction in comparison to continuously reinforced control RLA-I rats, this PREE being absent in RHA-I animals. These results are discussed within the framework of PREE theories that account for this effect by using emotional mechanisms, as pertains to the repeatedly observed RHA-RLA differences in emotional reactivity."
"The sensorimotor striatum is important for procedural learning, including skill learning. Our previous findings indicate that this part of the striatum mediates the acquisition of a motor skill in a running-wheel task and that this skill learning is dependent on striatal D1 dopamine receptors. Here, we investigated whether the sensorimotor striatum is also involved in the consolidation of this skill memory and whether this consolidation is modified by the indirect dopamine receptor agonist cocaine. Rats were trained on a running wheel for 2 days (40 min/day) to learn a new motor skill, that is, the ability to control the movement of the wheel. Before each training session, the animals received an injection of vehicle or cocaine (25mg/kg, i.p.). Immediately following the training session, an intrastriatal infusion of 2% lidocaine (1 microl) or a sham infusion were administered. Wheel-skill performance was tested before and repeatedly after the training. Our results show that post-trial intrastriatal infusion of lidocaine disrupted late-stage long-term skill memory (post-training days 6-26), but spared early long-term memory (1 day after the training). Skill consolidation was more susceptible to such disruption in animals that practiced less during the training. Cocaine given pre-trial prevented this post-trial disruption of skill consolidation. These findings indicate that the sensorimotor striatum is critical for the consolidation of late but not early long-term skill memory. Furthermore, cocaine appeared to stabilize motor-memory formation by protecting consolidation processes after the training."
"Recent studies have shown that the hippocampus is critical for the context-dependent expression of extinguished fear memories. Here we used Pavlovian fear conditioning in rats to explore whether the entorhinal cortex and fornix, which are the major cortical and subcortical interfaces of the hippocampus, are also involved in the context-dependence of extinction. After pairing an auditory conditional stimulus (CS) with an aversive footshock (unconditional stimulus or US) in one context, rats received an extinction session in which the CS was presented without the US in another context. Conditional fear to the CS was then tested in either the extinction context or a third familiar context; freezing behavior served as the index of fear. Sham-operated rats exhibited little conditional freezing to the CS in the extinction context, but showed a robust renewal of fear when tested outside of the extinction context. In contrast, rats with neurotoxic lesions in the entorhinal cortex or electrolytic lesions in the fornix did not exhibit a renewal of fear when tested outside the extinction context. Impairments in freezing behavior to the auditory CS were not able to account for the observed results, insofar as rats with either entorhinal cortex or fornix lesions exhibited normal freezing behavior during the conditioning session. Thus, contextual memory retrieval requires not only the hippocampus proper, but also its cortical and subcortical interfaces."
"Brain lateralization has long been thought to be unique to humans. To investigate the origins and functions of this feature, researchers study behavioural laterality in other animals. Despite a substantial database, manual laterality in non-human primates remains a controversial topic. We give here a review of the main findings on manual preference in great apes. This article presents data on hand preferences for a bimanual coordination in 29 bonobos (Pan paniscus). The study aims to provide data on manual laterality for a complex bimanual task in this very interesting and rarely studied species. Hand preferences were assessed using the 'tube task'. This task has been used with other species, which allows reliable data comparisons. The task requires a bimanual coordinated precise action: the subject holds the tube with one hand while reaching for food inside with the other hand. As a complex task, this measure has been shown to be efficient in revealing hand preferences. It has revealed group-level right bias in chimpanzees. Bonobos had never been tested. We recorded both independent bouts (counting only the first pattern of a sequence of identical actions) and frequency (counting every action). The bonobos exhibited strong hand preferences. With frequency, 11 bonobos were classified as right-handed, 15 were left-handed and 3 had no preference. With bouts, 8 bonobos were right-handed, 9 were left-handed and 12 had no preference. No group-level bias appeared. The results are discussed in relation with previous findings and theories on brain lateralization."
"Performing voluntary motor actions requires the translation of motor commands into a specific set of muscle activation. While it is assumed that this process is carried out via cooperative interactions between supraspinal and spinal neurons, the unique contribution of each of these areas to the process is still unknown. Many studies have focused on the neuronal representation of the motor command, mostly in the motor cortex. Nonetheless, to execute these commands there must be a mechanism that can translate this representation into a sustained drive to the spinal motoneurons (MNs). Here we review different candidate mechanisms for activating MNs and their possible role in voluntary movements. We discuss recent studies which directly estimate the contribution of segmental INs to the transmission of cortical command to MNs, both in terms of functional connectivity and as a computational link. Finally, we suggest a conceptual framework in which the cortical motor command is processed simultaneously via MNs and INs. In this model, the motor cortex provides a transient signal which is important for initiating new patterns of recruited muscles, whereas the INs translate this command into a sustained, amplified and muscle-based signal which is necessary to maintain ongoing muscle activity."
"The aim of this study was to determine if progesterone modulates object and spatial memory consolidation in young ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice. Object memory was tested in an object recognition task using 24- and 48-h delays. Spatial memory was tested in a 2-day version of the Morris water maze in which retention was tested 24 or 48 h after training. Immediately after training in each task, mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of vehicle or 5, 10, or 20mg/kg water-soluble progesterone. Mice were then tested 24 or 48 h later in the absence of circulating progesterone. Post-training injections of 10 and 20mg/kg progesterone enhanced object recognition, but not memory in the spatial water maze. These findings suggest that object memory consolidation in young female mice is more sensitive to the modulatory effects of progesterone than spatial memory consolidation, at least using the tasks, doses, and delays tested. As such, these findings may have important implications for the design of progesterone therapies intended to reduce age-related memory decline."
"Previous studies have described limb and hand movement abnormalities in a reach-to-eat task in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) and animal models of PD. The present study was directed toward examining reach-to-eat movements in early PD patients untreated with medication, along with a follow-up examination of a PD patient sub-group who were treated with a symptomatically stable dosage of dopamine replacement. Analysis of the reach-to-eat movement was made using blinded assessment under a validated scoring system, and comparisons were made on the total reach score and reach sub-component scores. In both examinations, PD patients had unilateral deficits or significant deficit asymmetry, as indicated by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores. UPDRS motor scores were higher for the most-affected side of the body (mean scores of 10.45 and 4.25 for more- and less-affected upper limbs, respectively), whereas reach scores were equivalently impaired for the two sides (median scores of 12.35 and 12.56 for more- and less-affected limbs, respectively). These differences between clinical and experimental assessments of motor impairments persisted among early PD patients treated with medication. Thus, functional reaching shows bilateral and symmetrical abnormalities in early PD patients, even when clinical assessment shows asymmetrical or even unilateral impairment. These findings suggest that functional qualitative reaching evaluation is a sensitive test in early PD, and that significant bilateral abnormalities in reach function are present even in pre-clinical stages of the disease."
"The involvement of the prefrontal cortex in executive control has been well established. It is, however, as yet unclear whether the basal ganglia and the cerebellum as components of frontostriatal/frontocerebellar networks also contribute to the executive domains multitasking and response inhibition. To investigate this issue, groups of patients with selective vascular lesions of the basal ganglia (n=13) or the cerebellum (n=14) were compared with matched healthy control groups. Several paradigms assessing the ability to process concurrent visual and auditory input and to simultaneously perform verbal and manual responses as well as the inhibition of habitual or newly acquired response tendencies were administered. Basal ganglia patients showed marked response slowing during coordination of sensory input from different modalities and high error rates during the inhibition of overlearned responses. There was no clear evidence of a cerebellar involvement in multitasking or response suppression. Taken together, the findings provided evidence for a striatal involvement in both multitasking and response inhibition, emphasizing the functional implication of subcortical components in frontostriatal circuits."
"Several studies have shown that the level of dopaminergic transmission and D1 receptor signaling is crucial for working memory (WM) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mammals. Thus, hyper- or hypostimulation of prefrontal D1 receptors are pathophysiological findings often involved in cognitive and WM impairments. These observations can be mimicked by supranormal stimulation or inhibition with D1 receptor agonists or D1 antagonists, respectively. As a consequence, it is assumed that there is a normal range of dopamine function in prefrontal cortex that can be described as an inverted U-shaped relationship between dopamine transmission, i.e. D1 receptor stimulation, and intact WM. If this is true, short-term fluctuations of cognitive performance might be described as small-scale adjustments along the tip of the inverted U-curve and should depend on D1 receptor stimulation. We tested this hypothesis in pigeons performing a delayed-matching-to-sample task (DMTS), a classic paradigm to test WM. We applied the D1 agonist SKF81297 and the D1 antagonist SCH23390 into the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), the avian functional analogue of the PFC, and simultaneously in the medial striatum (MSt), by in vivo microdialysis while the animals performed the task. Animals showed daily fluctuations in WM performance. While the D1 agonist was able to improve or to decrease performance during low or strong performance periods, respectively, performance did not differ from control with the D1 antagonist. This study shows that D1 receptors seem to calibrate differentially prefronto-striatal functions based on individual low or high performance states."
"Previous studies have shown that the functional development of auditory system is substantially influenced by the structure of environmental acoustic inputs in early life. In our present study, we investigated the effects of early auditory enrichment with music on rat auditory discrimination learning. We found that early auditory enrichment with music from postnatal day (PND) 14 enhanced learning ability in auditory signal-detection task and in sound duration-discrimination task. In parallel, a significant increase was noted in NMDA receptor subunit NR2B protein expression in the auditory cortex. Furthermore, we found that auditory enrichment with music starting from PND 28 or 56 did not influence NR2B expression in the auditory cortex. No difference was found in the NR2B expression in the inferior colliculus (IC) between music-exposed and normal rats, regardless of when the auditory enrichment with music was initiated. Our findings suggest that early auditory enrichment with music influences NMDA-mediated neural plasticity, which results in enhanced auditory discrimination learning."
"The pig (Sus scrofus) is a valuable animal for modeling human brain diseases. When evaluating animal models of many human brain disorders cognitive testing is crucial, but the pig's ability to learn the typical types of tasks used in neuropsychological testing of other species is largely unknown. The present study is the first study to evaluate the pig's ability to learn the Delayed Non-Match to Sample (DNMS) task. The pigs were trained in a maze on a spatial version of the DNMS task. Initially, the pigs were trained with a 60s delay interval between sample and test phases, and we found that the pigs required an average of 144 trials to reach criterion for learning the task, which is similar to macaque monkeys. We also found that pigs, in contrast to rats, do not have a natural tendency to alternate in their choices in the task. To evaluate the sensitivity to reduced memory function longer delay intervals (300 s and 900 s) and a scopolamine challenge were introduced. In our test condition we found a significant effect of longer delay intervals (F(2,21)=34.43, P&lt;0.0001) and of scopolamine (F(1,14)=14.28, P=0.002) on the number of correct choices in the task. We conclude that the G&#xf6;ttingen minipig can solve the spatial DNMS task and that the task is sensitive to both increasing delay intervals and to scopolamine."
"A sub-chronic administration of phencyclidine to the rat brings about enduring pathophysiological and cognitive changes that resemble some features of schizophrenia. The present study aimed to determine whether the behavioural consequence of this phencyclidine regime extends to a long-term disruption of social interaction that might provide a parallel with some negative symptoms of the disease. Rats were treated with phencyclidine (2mg/kg bi-daily for 1 week) or vehicle followed by a drug-free period. Social interaction was assessed 24h, 1 week, 3 weeks and 6 weeks post-treatment. A long-lasting disturbance of social behaviour was observed in the phencyclidine group, namely more contact and non-contact interaction with an unfamiliar target rat at all time points. Six weeks post-phencyclidine, analysis of brains showed a reduction in expression of parvalbumin immunoreactive neurons in the hippocampus with significant reductions localised to the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions. These results show that sub-chronic phencyclidine produces long-lasting disruptions in social interaction that, however, do not model the social withdrawal seen in patients with schizophrenia. These disturbances of social behaviour may be associated with concurrent pathophysiological brain changes."
"The hypothetical relationship between circadian rhythms alterations and depression has prompted studies that examine the resultant effects of various antidepressants. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) exerts significant antidepressant effects that have been modelled in the laboratory via the use of electroconvulsive shock (ECS) in rats. However, data on the effects of ECT or ECS vis-&#xe0;-vis the circadian rhythms remain scarce. Thus, we report here the effects of acute and chronic ECS administration on the temperature and motor activity circadian rhythms of rats. The motor activity and core body temperature of rats were continuously recorded to determine the circadian rhythms. We carried out three experiments. In the first, we analyzed the effects of acute ECS on both the phase and period when applied at different times of the subjective day. In the second and third experiments ECS was nearly daily applied to rats for 3 weeks: respectively, under dim red light, which allows a robust free-running circadian rhythm; and under light-dark cycles of 22 h (T22), a setting that implies dissociation in the circadian system. Acute ECS does not modify the phase or the period of circadian rhythms. Chronic administration of ECS produces an increase in motor activity and temperature, a decrease in the amplitude of circadian rhythms, although the period of the free-running rhythm remains unaffected. In conclusion, while chronic ECS does alter the overt rhythms of motor activity and temperature, it does not modify the functioning of the circadian pacemaker."
"The present experiment investigated the effect of light cycle phase on morphine-induced conditioned taste aversions in the Lewis (LEW), Fischer (F344) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat strains. Separate groups of rats from each strain were trained during either the light phase or the dark phase on a procedure in which saccharin was paired with one of two doses of morphine (or vehicle). With 3.2mg/kg morphine, strain differences were observed during the light phase, with F344 rats displaying a significantly stronger taste aversion than the LEW rats, who displayed a significantly stronger aversion than the SD rats. In contrast, during the dark phase, 3.2mg/kg morphine produced comparable, moderately strong aversions in all strains. With 10.0mg/kg morphine, F344 rats developed stronger aversions than either the LEW or SD rats in both phases of the light cycle. The effect of light cycle was most clearly seen in the SD rats, where stronger aversions were produced in the dark phase for both morphine doses. For the LEW rats, stronger aversions were produced in the dark as compared to the light only with the low dose of morphine. For the F344 rats, aversions of comparable strength were observed in both phases of the light cycle for both morphine doses. The finding that light cycle differentially affects morphine-induced taste aversions in these strains is consistent with what is known about strain differences in circadian patterns of corticosterone activity and with previous results relating corticosterone to morphine-induced taste aversions."
"Previous work in our laboratory has shown that food deprivation and food presentation produce different patterns of neuronal activity (as measured by c-Fos immunoreactivity) in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens of rats. Since the amygdala has been implicated in both motivational and reinforcement processes and has neuronal connections to both the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, it was of interest to assess amygdaloid c-Fos immunoreactivity during similar manipulations of food deprivation and presentation. In the current study, c-Fos counts in both basolateral and central amygdalar nuclei were observed to increase in rats 12- and 36-h food deprived (relative to 0-h controls)-an effect reversed by the presentation of either a small or large meal (2.5 or 20g of food). In another experiment, rats working on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement exhibited elevated break-points as a function of food deprivation, a result consistent with the view that the feeding manipulations increased the subjects' level of motivation. In contrast, food deprivation reduced the spontaneous locomotor activity of rats, presumably as a result of an inherent energy-conservation strategy when no food is readily available. These data suggest that the state of food deprivation is associated with: (a) enhanced behavioral output only when food is attainable (increased goal-directed behavior, but decreased spontaneous activity), and (b) increased synaptic engagement in neuronal circuits involved in affective valuation and related decision-making (increased c-Fos counts in the amygdala)."
"This study was designed to separate the neural response associated with awareness of a visual object from the neural responses to the visual input without awareness. Two classes of stimuli were presented to subjects: (1) a field of randomly positioned and oriented Gabor patches (no contour) or (2) the same field of Gabor patches in which a subset of the Gabor patches were oriented in such a way as to give rise to the percept of an ellipse (contour). To measure the electroencephalograph (EEG) responses to the contour without awareness, trials during which a contour was present but not perceived were compared to trials where no contour was present and its absence was correctly indicated. At beta frequencies, the presence of the contour reduced the evoked potential (EP) power approximately 130-230 ms post-stimulus. Coherence in the theta band were also reduced when a contour was present but not perceived. Thus, modulations of the EP take place when a contour is presented even without the subjects' awareness. To explore the correlates of awareness, trials during which the subject correctly indicated the presence of a contour were compared to trials in which the object was not detected. Consistent across subjects, awareness caused an increase in the EP power in the beta range around 130-230 ms post-stimulus. These results suggest that the neural response to an object and awareness of that object are dissociable in EEG recordings."
"Epidural motor cortex stimulation (MCS) has been used for treating patients with neuropathic pain resistant to other therapeutic approaches. Experimental evidence suggests that the motor cortex is also involved in the modulation of normal nociceptive response, but the underlying mechanisms of pain control have not been clarified yet. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of epidural electrical MCS on the nociceptive threshold of naive rats. Electrodes were placed on epidural motor cortex, over the hind paw area, according to the functional mapping accomplished in this study. Nociceptive threshold and general activity were evaluated under 15-min electrical stimulating sessions. When rats were evaluated by the paw pressure test, MCS induced selective antinociception in the paw contralateral to the stimulated cortex, but no changes were noticed in the ipsilateral paw. When the nociceptive test was repeated 15 min after cessation of electrical stimulation, the nociceptive threshold returned to basal levels. On the other hand, no changes in the nociceptive threshold were observed in rats evaluated by the tail-flick test. Additionally, no behavioral or motor impairment were noticed in the course of stimulation session at the open-field test. Stimulation of posterior parietal or somatosensory cortices did not elicit any changes in the general activity or nociceptive response. Opioid receptors blockade by naloxone abolished the increase in nociceptive threshold induced by MCS. Data shown herein demonstrate that epidural electrical MCS elicits a substantial and selective antinociceptive effect, which is mediated by opioids."
"Cisplatin chemotherapy frequently causes severe vomiting in two temporally separated clusters of bouts dubbed the acute and delayed phases. Cannabinoids can inhibit the acute phase, albeit through a poorly understood mechanism. We examined the substrates of cannabinoid-mediated inhibition of both the emetic phases via immunolabeling for serotonin, Substance P, cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB(1), CB(2)), and the neuronal activation marker Fos in the least shrew (Cryptotis parva). Shrews were injected with cisplatin (10mg/kg i.p.), and one of vehicle, Delta(9)-THC, or both Delta(9)-THC and the CB(1) receptor antagonist SR141716A (2mg/kg i.p.), and monitored for vomiting. Delta(9)-THC-pretreatment caused concurrent decreases in the number of shrews expressing vomiting and Fos-immunoreactivity (Fos-IR), effects which were blocked by SR141716A-pretreatment. Acute phase vomiting induced Fos-IR in the solitary tract nucleus (NTS), dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMNX), and area postrema (AP), whereas in the delayed phase Fos-IR was not induced in the AP at all, and was induced at lower levels in the other nuclei when compared to the acute phase. CB(1) receptor-IR in the NTS was dense, punctate labeling indicative of presynaptic elements, which surrounded Fos-expressing NTS neurons. CB(2) receptor-IR was not found in neuronal elements, but in vascular-appearing structures. All areas correlated with serotonin- and Substance P-IR. These results support published acute phase data in other species, and are the first describing Fos-IR following delayed phase emesis. The data suggest overlapping but separate mechanisms are invoked for each phase, which are sensitive to antiemetic effects of Delta(9)-THC mediated by CB(1) receptors."
"Previously, we identified separate genetic influences on ventral versus dorsal hippocampal volume in BXD recombinant inbred mice [Martin MV, Dong HX, Vallera D, Lu L, Williams RW, Rosen GD, et al. Independent quantitative trait loci influence ventral and dorsal hippocampal volume in recombinant inbred strains of mice. Genes Brain Behav 2006;5:614-23]. Based on genotype at genetic markers associated with ventral hippocampal volume, we evaluated BXD mouse strains with relatively small versus large ventral hippocampal volumes using numerous behavioral paradigms known to rely upon hippocampal function and several other tasks that tap into behaviors analogous to those often impaired in schizophrenia. We observed a relationship between genotype at markers known to influence ventral hippocampal volume and working memory at an intermediate memory load. There was no association between genotype at markers known to influence ventral hippocampal volume and spatial reference memory, prepulse inhibition, or elevated plus maze performance. The relevance of these findings for understanding the pathophysiology of schizophrenia are discussed, including the possibility that genetic predisposition toward anterior hippocampal volume reductions and working memory deficits in schizophrenia may be related through a shared genetic locus."
"Immunohistochemical Fos staining has proven to be a method to identify the neurons that are activated by stimulation. Although methamphetamine (MA)-conditioned place preference (CPP) memory was long-lasting, how this memory was established and retrieved remained unknown. We used the vehicle- and MA-conditioned environment (including cues and context) to reactivate the MA-CPP memory in mice. In the limbic system, Fos-positive neurons were examined following retrieval of the MA-CPP memory. We demonstrated that the current conditioning procedure produced reliable MA-CPP performance. Moreover, enhanced Fos expressions were found in the medial prefrontal cortex and the core of the nucleus accumbens after reactivation of the MA-CPP memory. Furthermore, familiarity with the environmental cues/context was found to significantly enhance Fos expressions in dorsal striatum and dentate gyrus. Nucleus accumbens shell, basolateral or lateral amygdala, in this regard, did not seem to be involved in retrieval of the MA-CPP memory. These results, taken together, suggest that the medial prefrontal cortex and the core of the nucleus accumbens are anatomical substrates responsible for reactivation of the MA-CPP memory."
"When we manipulate familiar objects in our daily life, our grip force anticipates the physical demands right from the moment of contact with the object, indicating the existence of a memory for relevant object properties. This study explores the formation and consolidation of the memory processes that associate either familiar (size) or arbitrary object features (color) with object weight. In the general task, participants repetitively lifted two differently weighted objects (580 and 280 g) in a pseudo-random order. Forty young healthy adults participated in this study and were randomly distributed into four groups: Color Cue Single task (CCS, blue and red, 9.8(3)cm(3)), Color Cue Dual task (CCD), No Cue (NC) and Size Cue (SC, 9.8(3) and 6(3)cm(3)) group. All groups performed a repetitive precision grasp-lift task and were retested with the same protocol after a 5-min pause. The CCD group was also required to simultaneously perform a memory task during each lift of differently weighted objects coded by color. The results show that groups lifting objects with arbitrary or familiar features successfully formed the association between object weight and manipulated object features and incorporated this into grip force programming, as observed in the different scaling of grip force and grip force rate for different object weights. An arbitrary feature, i.e., color, can be sufficiently associated with object weight, however with less strength than the familiar feature of size. The simultaneous memory task impaired anticipatory force scaling during repetitive object lifting but did not jeopardize the learning process and the consolidation of the associative memory."
"To examine whisker barrel evoked response potentials in chronically implanted rats during behavioral learning with very fast response times, rats must be calm while immobilized with their head restrained. We quantified their behaviors during training with an ethogram and measured each individual animals' progress over the training period. Once calm under restraint, rats were conditioned to differentiate between a reward and control whisker twitch, then provide a lick response when presented with the correct stimulus, rewarded by a drop of water. Rats produced the correct licking response (after reward whisker twitch), and learned not to lick after a control whisker was twitched. By implementing a high-density 64-channel electrocorticogram (ECoG) electrode array, we mapped the barrel field of the somatosensory cortex with high spatial and temporal resolution during conditioned lick behaviors. In agreement with previous reports, we observe a larger evoked response after training, probably related to mechanisms of cortical plasticity."
"The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a second messenger and a central component of intracellular signaling pathways that regulate a wide range of biological functions, including memory. Hence, in this work, firstly the time-course of memory formation was determined in an autoshaping learning task, which had allowed the identification of testing times for increases or decreases in performance. Next, untrained, trained and overtrained groups were compared in cAMP production. Moreover, selective stimulation and antagonism of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(7) receptors during memory formation and cAMP production were determined. Finally, since there is scarce information about how pharmacological models of amnesia affect cAMP production, the cholinergic or glutamatergic antagonists, scopolamine and dizocilpine, were tested. The major findings of this work showed that when the time-course was determined inasmuch as training and testing sessions occurred, memory performance was graduate and progressive. Notably, for the fourth to seventh (i.e., 48-120 h following autoshaping training session) testing session performance was significantly higher from the previous ones. When animals received 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(7) receptor agonists and antagonists or amnesic drugs significant increases or decrements in memory performance were observed at 24 and 48 h. Moreover, when ex vivo cAMP production from trained and overtrained groups were compared to untrained ones, significant differences were observed among groups and brain areas. Trained animals treated with 8-OHDPAT, AS19, 8-OHDPAT plus AS19, WAY100635, SB-269970, scopolamine or dizocilpine were compared to similar untrained groups, and eightfold-reduced cAMP production was evident, showing the importance of cAMP production in the signaling case in mammalian memory formation."
"Birds and fish use monocular viewing to bring to bear appropriate lateralised specialisations. In larval zebrafish, persistent left eye (LE) viewing of their own reflection is interrupted by a series of brief 'events', in which the right eye has equal use. These recur with precise 160 s periodicity, with the first beginning after 40s, and allow right and left mechanisms to assess the reflection. In a strain in which persistent LE bias ceased after about 2 min, events were still marked by a brief period of frontal viewing, immediately after the time of each event ('after-effects'). Such viewing allows simultaneous access by both right and left visual systems, and may be associated therefore with interaction, perhaps involving linkage of initially independent traces. Events appeared to cease after the maximal after-effect following the third event. Older fish show changes in overt behaviour immediately after event times; again the third event ends this. Processes associated with events thus progressively change what is available to recall. Domestic chicks show enhanced evocation of response (e.g. sex, defense) to fellows, with the LE but not the right, if exposed to light during embryonic development. In zebrafish (where light may act by an epiphyseal route) we found that after dark development, viewing bias peaked at the time of each event, with LE use at the first and right at the second. The main factor determining the outcome of right/left competition appears here to be recency of access to viewing."
"Exposing male C57BL/6J mice repeatedly, in an unpredictable and uncontrollable fashion to rats, alters their cognitive performance and the neuroendocrine stress response, weeks to months after the rat stress. Continuous observation of the behavioural activity of male C57BL/6J mice in their home cage before (baseline) and after rat exposure could reveal if repeated rat exposure leads to changes in circadian activity patterns, which is a key feature of chronic stress and stress-related disorders in humans. Rat stress (1) decreased exploratory and foraging activity as characterized by increased time spent in the shelter and less time in the open area; (2) reduced sucrose consumption and inhibited the development of sucrose preference, suggesting changes in the reward system and (3) the exploration pattern in a novel environment included more behavioural perseverations, but no change in general locomotor activity. Comparison to baseline activity pattern, i.e., before any intervention, revealed that already the control procedure to rat exposure (spending the same amount of time in another cage) disrupted the organization of behavioural activity patterns, albeit to a different and lesser degree than observed in rat stressed mice. While only the longitudinal design of the study allowed detecting these dynamic patterns of circadian activities, the distinct behavioural changes in foraging and explorative activities support our notion that repeated rat exposure might serve as mouse model of chronic stress."
"Voluntary wheel running in rodents is associated with a number of adaptive behavioral and physiological effects including improved learning, reduction in stress-associated behaviors, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, increases in neurotrophic factors, and changes in several signaling molecules. Exercise has also been reported to reduce anxiety-like behaviors. However, other studies have failed to find an anxiolytic effect of exercise. The inconsistencies in the literature may contribute to the scarcity of data examining the physiological correlates of the anxiolytic effect of exercise. Here we show that 2 weeks of voluntary exercise in male C57 mice is associated with reduced anxiety as measured with acoustic startle, stress-induced hyperthermia, social interaction, light-enhanced startle, and some, but not all, measures in the open field. A great deal is known about the neural circuits underlying anxiety. Given the consistency of the anxiolytic effect of voluntary exercise across several measures, it is now possible to begin a systematic analysis of the physiological basis of the anxiolytic effect of exercise."
"Animal models of chronic stress, such as 21 days of 6h/daily restraint stress cause changes in neuronal morphology in the hippocampus and alter behaviour. These changes are partly mediated by the glucocorticoids. The objective of this study was threefold: (1) to study how this particular chronic stress paradigm influences expression of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor mRNA, (2) to study the effect of previous repeated restraint stress on the behaviours executed in the forced swim test (FST) (e.g. a novel inescapable stress situation) and (3) to investigate the modulating effect of electroconvulsive stimulations (ECS) on the neural and behavioural effects of the stress paradigm. The study shows that restraint stress lowered glucocorticoid receptor mRNA levels in all hippocampal regions, including the CA3 region which is the site of the characteristic dendritic reorganization seen in this model. Furthermore, stressed rats displayed higher increases in immobility and decreased latency to immobility subjected to the novel stressor of the FST than non-stressed rats. ECS abolished both the neural and behavioural effects of the restraint stress and thus protected against the deleterious effects of the stress paradigm. The clinical relevance of these findings is discussed."
"The goal of the study was to investigate the neural circuit recruited by adult readers during performance of a lexical decision task by assessing the relative timing of neurophysiological activity in the brain regions that comprise this circuit. The time course of regional activation associated with lexical decision was studied in 17 adult volunteers using magnetoencephalography. Following activity in mesial occipital cortices, activation progressed to lateral and ventral occipito-temporal regions (often encompassing the posterior portion of the middle temporal gyrus), followed by activity in the superior temporal gyri (STGp), motor/premotor cortices, and the inferior frontal gyrus. The latency of STGp activation relative to the latency of the motor response to the word stimuli did not support critical involvement of this area in lexical decision. Timing, word length, and word frequency effects found for activity in each area are discussed in relation to the purported roles of each region into the brain circuit for reading."
"We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine responses within auditory cortical fields during the passive listening of pure tone (PT) and frequency modulated (FM) stimuli in seven early blind (EB), five late blind (LB) and six sighted control (SC) individuals. Subjects were scanned using a ""sparse sampling"" imaging technique while listening to PT and FM sounds presented at either low (400 Hz) or high (4 kHz) center frequencies. When high tones were directly compared to low tones, the resulting activation maps showed a general tonotopic organization within the superior and middle temporal lobes at statistically significant thresholds for the SC and LB groups while the EB group showed a comparable tonotopic organization but only at statistically non-significance thresholds. A contrast of all tonal stimuli to a quiet baseline similarly revealed significantly less signal volume in the EB than in either the LB or SC groups. These results suggest that EB does not alter inherent patterns of tonotopic organization but rather, under low-demand listening conditions, results in a more efficient processing of simple auditory stimuli within the early stages of the auditory hierarchy. While these effects must be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample sizes, they indicate that functional responses in auditory cortical areas are altered by visual deprivation and that intramodal auditory plasticity may underlie previously reported auditory advantages observed in the blind."
"In women, breastfeeding generally results in reductions in anxiety and increased positive mood. However, approximately 10-15% of women experience depressed mood and increased anxiety during the first year postpartum. Recent research has demonstrated that offspring-exposure is important for the reduction in behaviours related to depression and anxiety in the mother. It remains to be determined whether these effects are due to factors related to pregnancy and/or pup-exposure, are associated with the degree of maternal behaviour by the mother towards offspring, or persist after weaning. To address these questions the present study used four groups of female rats; primiparous, nulliparous, primip-no-pups (primiparous females with pups permanently removed), and sensitized females. Depressive- and anxiety-like behaviours were assessed 1 week after weaning/pup-exposure (4 weeks after birth for primip-no-pups animals) using the forced swim test for measures of depressive-like behaviour, and the open field test and elevated plus maze for measure of anxiety-like behaviour. Results demonstrate that primiparous females without pup-exposure have increased depressive-like, but not anxiety-like, behaviour compared to primiparous and sensitized females. In addition, kyphotic nursing by primiparous mothers was negatively related to behavioural measures of depression and anxiety. From this work it is clear that pup-exposure is important for reductions in depressive-like behaviour in parturient females. Further research is needed to determine the extent of these changes and the neural and hormonal correlates of these events."
"Intra-nucleus accumbens (Acb) infusion of cholinergic muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine (10 microg/0.5 microl), markedly reduced fat intake elicited by intra-Acb treatment of the mu-opioid receptor agonist, DAMGO, with 30 min and 4h pretreatment intervals. Intra-Acb scopolamine infusions also reduced food intake in food-deprived rats, but not water intake in water-deprived rats. Hence, Acb muscarinic manipulations exhibit some specificity for feeding, perhaps via interactions with the striatal opioid system."
"Stroke in term neonates remains a significant cause of long-term neurological morbidity. This study was designed to assess the relationships between ischemic stroke induced by permanent unilateral carotid ligation in P12 CD1 mice and the structural and functional outcomes in the young mice as a consequence. After P12 ischemic strokes, mice were behaviorally tested using accelerated rotorod, spontaneous alternation on a T-maze, open-field, and cylinder tests between P33 and P39. Brain injury was scored by histology at P40 with cresyl violet-stained coronal sections and computerized quantification of the ischemic injury. The ligation-injured mice were not different from controls on cylinder testing for asymmetric use of their forelimb, or on rotorod measures. In the spontaneous alternation task, however, injured mice demonstrated significantly lower rates of alternation indicating a deficit in working memory. Open-field testing repeated on two consecutive days revealed that the ligated mice were less active than the controls and that they failed to habituate to the open field environment between sessions indicating a learning deficit. Overall, our results demonstrate that ischemia induced by our neonatal stroke model produces behavioral deficits that are consistent with the brain injury."
"L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) is among the motor complications that arise in Parkinson patients after a prolonged treatment with levodopa (L-DOPA). Since previous transcriptome and proteomic studies performed in the rat model of LID suggested important changes in striatal energy-related components, we hypothesize that oral creatine supplementation could prevent or attenuate the occurrence of LID. In this study, 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats received a 2% creatine-supplemented diet for 1 month prior to L-DOPA therapy. During the 21 days of L-DOPA treatment, significant reductions in abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) have been observed in the creatine-supplemented group, without any worsening of parkinsonism. In situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry analysis of the striatum also showed a reduction in the levels of prodynorphin mRNA and FosB/DeltaFosB-immunopositive cells in creatine-supplemented diet group, an effect that was dependant on the development of AIMs. Further investigation of the bioenergetics' status of the denervated striatum revealed significant changes in the levels of creatine both after L-DOPA alone and with the supplemented diet. In conclusion, we demonstrated that combining L-DOPA therapy with a diet enriched in creatine could attenuate LID, which may represent a new way to control the motor complications associated with L-DOPA therapy."
"Chronic morphine exposure induces physical dependence and tolerance. Previous studies have shown that there is a decrease in met-enkephalin levels in states of morphine physical dependence, and that increasing enkephalin during opiate physical withdrawal ameliorates the severity of the morphine withdrawal syndrome. In order to investigate the role of spinal opioid peptide in the phenomenon of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal we examined the effect of herpes simplex virus vector-mediated overexpression of proenkephalin in lumbar dorsal root ganglia in rats with neuropathic pain treated with morphine. The morphine physical dependence was induced by chronic administration of intraperitoneal (IP) morphine for 2 weeks. Rats with neuropathic pain inoculated subcutaneously with the vector-mediated overexpression of proenkephalin showed a significant reduction in jumps, 'wet-dog' shakes, diarrhea and ptosis precipitated by naloxone after 2 weeks of morphine treatment. The global withdrawal score was also reduced significantly by vector-mediated overexpression of proenkephalin. These studies demonstrate a role for opioid peptide in the spinal cord in mediating some of the withdrawal response."
"Maternal aggression is most intense in lactating rats from the 3rd to the 12th day postpartum. The purpose of this study was to determine if plasma prolactin (PRL) and prolactin receptor (PRL-R(L)) mRNA expression in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of lactating rats are altered in association with maternal aggression. Lactating Sprague Dawley rats were divided into five groups and exposed for 10 min to an intruder male or to an object on postpartum day 8. Trunk blood and the brain of the dams were collected 30 or 240 min after exposure and from a non-exposed group. Lower levels of prolactin were found 30 min after the aggression test. No change was detected in the number of cells expressing PRL-R(L) mRNA by in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH) as a function of testing. However, the correlation between plasma PRL and PRL-R(L) mRNA expression in the mothers changed from positive in control females to negative in intruder exposed animals. These data support the concept that a maternal aggressive experience, while acutely altering PRL secretion, fails to affect PRL-R(L) mRNA expression."
"5-HT4 agonists are currently being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and have previously been demonstrated to improve cognitive performance in a variety of tests but none that specifically test attention. Here we characterise the 5-HT4 partial agonist SL65.0155 compared to the reference drug, nicotine, in a test that is used to measure attention in rats, the five-choice serial reaction time task (5CSRTT). SL65.0155 (0.1 or 1 mg/kg s.c) and nicotine (0.2 mg/kg s.c.) were tested in protocols using fixed or variable stimulus durations. SL65.0155 improved performance by virtue of reducing incorrect responses and increasing % correct trials. Perseverative responses were reduced by SL65.0155, and latency during incorrect trials was increased following treatment with 0.1 mg/kg SL65.0155. Nicotine, as previously reported, improved performance in several parameters in the 5CSRTT, including response latencies, errors of omission and correct responses in both the baseline and variable stimulus protocol. These data suggest 5-HT4 agonists may have beneficial effects on attention and thereby may be useful for the treatment of cognitive deficits."
"To determine the influence of gravity during critical periods of development is important in the perspective of long-term spaceflight and exploration, data coming from this kind of studies providing insight into basical biological phenomena underlying the development of the nervous system and its plasticity. Aim of the present study was to evaluate neurobehavioural responses to hypergravity exposure in CD-1 mice at different stage of development. Early adolescent (postnatal day 28, PND 28), adolescent (PND 42) and young-adult (PND 60) male and female mice were exposed to acute 2g rotational-generated hypergravity. Motion sickness index and behavioural performances pre, during and after rotation were recorded, and long-lasting effects on exploratory behaviour (hole-board test) and emotional/anxiety-like responses (plus-maze test) were investigated. Furthermore, in order to correlate behavioural changes with alterations in central levels of neurotrophins, brain amounts of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) were also assessed on PND 90, following a re-exposure to hypergravity. Age and sex differences were observed, females being more vulnerable than males to motion sickness, and susceptibility to hypergravity increasing with age of exposure. Moreover, mice showed a general reduction in spontaneous activity during the rotation, while recovery time after rotation became progressively longer with increasing age of the experimental subjects. Long-term effects on exploratory behaviour and emotional/anxiety-like response were also observed, behavioural profiles mainly changing in those animals experiencing hypergravity as young-adults. Finally, major changes in brain levels of NGF and BDNF were detected in mice firstly exposed as young-adults."
"It has been shown that cannabinoids interact with the opiate system in reward-related behaviors and in animal models of addiction. In the present study, the effects of bilateral intra-accumbal administration of AM251, a CB1 receptor antagonist, on the acquisition and expression of ineffective dose of morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in morphine-sensitized rats were investigated. 158 adult male albino Wistar rats were used in these experiments. Subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of morphine (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2.5 and 5mg/kg) induced CPP only at the dose of 5mg/kg. In addition, repeated administration of morphine (5mg/kg; s.c.), once daily for 3 days followed by 5 days free of the opioid (sensitization period), increased conditioning response induced by ineffective doses of morphine (0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 mg/kg). Bilateral intra-accumbal administration of AM251 (5, 25 and 125 ng/0.5 microl per side) dose-dependently reduced the acquisition and expression of morphine-induced CPP in morphine-sensitized rats, while bilateral intra-accumbal administration of neither saline nor DMSO (0.5 microl/side) had effects on the acquisition and expression of morphine-induced CPP in sensitized rats. The results indicated that CB1 receptors within the nucleus accumbens are involved in the acquisition and expression of morphine-induced CPP in sensitized rats. Our findings also suggest the existence of cross-talk between cannabinoids and opiates on the sensitization to morphine and the implication of endocannabinoid system in the process of sensitization to opiates."
"Previous reports have demonstrated that pain is influenced by environmental factors. This investigation examined the effects of housing supplementation, via the inclusion of objects to the home cage environment, on inflammation-induced nociceptive behaviors. The degree of thermal hyperalgesia was significantly lower in rats housed in a supplemented home cage environment, as compared to rats housed in basic cages. These data indicate that environmental enrichment significantly affects nociceptive responses."
"This study evaluates the event-related potential (ERP) components in a single outcome gambling task that involved monetary losses and gains. The participants were 50 healthy young volunteers (25 males and 25 females). The gambling task involved valence (loss and gain) and amount (50 cent and 10 cent) as outcomes. The outcome-related negativity (ORN/N2) and outcome-related positivity (ORP/P3) were analyzed and compared across conditions and gender. Monetary gain (compared to loss) and higher amount (50 cent compared to 10 cent) produced higher amplitudes and shorter latencies in both ORN and ORP components. Difference wave plots showed that earlier processing (200-400 ms) is dominated by the valence (loss/gain) while later processing (after 400 ms) is marked by the amount (50 cent/10 cent). Functional mapping using Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) indicated that the ORN separated the loss against gain in both genders, while the ORP activity distinguished the 50 cent against 10 cent in males. This study further strengthens the view that separate brain processes/circuitry may mediate loss and gain. Although there were no gender differences in behavioral and impulsivity scores, ORN and ORP measures for different task conditions had significant correlations with behavioral scores. This gambling paradigm may potentially offer valuable indicators to study outcome processing and impulsivity in normals as well as in clinical populations."
"Resting-state networks dissociate in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in AD brain is vulnerable to isolation from the rest of brain. However, it remains unclear how this functional connectivity is related to PCC changes. We employed resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) to examine brain regions with a functional connection to PCC in a mild AD group compared with matched control subjects. PCC connectivity was gathered by investigating synchronic low frequency fMRI signal fluctuations with a temporal correlation method. We found asymmetric PCC-left hippocampus, right dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex and right thalamus connectivity disruption. In addition, some other regions such as the bilateral visual cortex, the infero-temporal cortex, the posterior orbital frontal cortex, the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and the precuneus showed decreased functional connectivity to the PCC. There were also some regions, primarily in the left frontal-parietal cortices, that showed increased connectivity. These regions included the medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex, the left basal ganglia and the left primary motor cortex. Impairments to memory, high vision-related functions and olfaction in AD can be explained by a disruption to the functional connection of resting-state networks. The results of increased connectivity may support the compensatory-recruitment hypothesis. Our findings suggest that the characteristics of resting-state functional connectivity could plausibly provide an early imaging biomarker for AD."
"Studies show that changes in environmental context alter the spatial firing patterns ('remapping') and increase immediate early gene activation in hippocampal but not subicular neurons. However, such studies rarely report co-occurring behavioural responses. We examined the behavioural effects of habituating rats to a walled open field, and then of changing the environmental context by altering wall patterns and floor colour. These kinds of cue change are known to elicit spatial remapping in hippocampal regions, but not the subiculum. Relative to controls (no cue alterations), alteration of wall patterns elicited significant increases in exploratory locomotion through the open field, while combined alterations of floor colour and wall patterns elicited an even higher increase in exploratory locomotion. In addition, combined alterations (floor colour and wall patterns) significantly increased rearing frequency, and significantly decreased the time the rats spent immobile. These findings are relevant to how changes in environmental context affect neuronal responses in the hippocampal formation, and may aid in the development of novelty-response tasks where novelty resides in open field surfaces."
"The 14-unit T-maze has proven to be a valuable tool for investigating age-associated memory impairment (AAMI). While another task widely used to evaluate AAMI, the water maze, is primarily used to evaluate allocentric hippocampal-dependent spatial memory, the 14-unit T-maze can assess egocentric procedural memory. Although several brain structures, e.g. hippocampus, parietal cortex, have been implicated in acquisition and retention performance in the 14-unit T-maze, there has been no evaluation of the involvement of the striatum, a brain region implicated in procedural learning and memory. The current study revealed that excitotoxic lesions of the medial or lateral striatum significantly impaired acquisition, as measured by errors and latency, on this task without disruption of motor function. These results indicate that the 14-unit T-maze most likely is requires a large egocentric procedural learning component, and previously observed AAMI may involve age-related dysfunction of the striatum."
"Current literature suggests that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are involved in major depression. In rodents, antidepressant-like effects of both nicotine and the non-selective nAChR antagonist mecamylamine have been reported. Nicotine increases serotonergic and noradrenergic neuronal activity and facilitates serotonin and noradrenaline release. Thus, we hypothesise that nicotine may enhance the behavioural effects of serotonin (e.g., citalopram) and/or noradrenaline (e.g., reboxetine) reuptake inhibitors. Here, we tested if nicotine enhanced the activity of citalopram or reboxetine in the mouse forced swim test (mFST) and the mouse tail suspension test (mTST). The potential for mecamylamine to augment antidepressant drug action was also investigated. Sub-threshold and threshold doses of citalopram (3 and 10mg/kg) or reboxetine (3, 10 and 20mg/kg) were tested alone and in combination with nicotine (0.3 and 1.0mg/kg) and mecamylamine (1 and 3mg/kg). Locomotor activity experiments were performed to rule out non-specific stimulant effects. Nicotine (1.0mg/kg) enhanced the effect of 10mg/kg citalopram and 20mg/kg reboxetine in the mFST. Similarly, nicotine (1.0mg/kg) enhanced the effect of 3 and 10mg/kg citalopram and 3 and 10mg/kg reboxetine in the mTST. No concomitant locomotor stimulation was observed at the tested dose combinations. Mecamylamine was effective on its own in some tests, but did not augment the effects of citalopram or reboxetine at the doses tested. The data show that nicotine enhances the effects of both serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, possibly reflecting nicotine's facilitating effects on the release of these two neurotransmitters, and indicating that nicotine may enhance antidepressant action."
"To identify genetic risk factors involved in relapse to the abuse of drugs in humans, it is essential for researchers to develop a reliable mouse model of relapse by extending well-established extinction-reinstatement procedures in rats. Because of technical difficulties such as the relatively short duration of catheter patency in mice, few reports are available on the characterization of extinction-reinstatement behavior in wild-type and genetically engineered mutant mice. In this review, efforts are made to describe practical considerations during the establishment of extinction-reinstatement procedure in mice, including drug-primed, cue-induced, and stress-triggered reinstatement of previously extinguished drug-seeking behavior. Next, attention will be given to some characteristics of extinction-reinstatement behavior in mice. The present review might provide a new impetus in the exploration of genetic risk factors involved in relapse to drug dependence/addiction in humans using extinction-reinstatement procedures in widely available mutant mice."
"This study investigated behavioral differences between neonatal rats with vasopressin AVP deficiency (di/di) and those with little (+/di) or no deficiency (+/+) using a number of open field metrics. Infant rats (pups) at days 7 and 10 postpartum were videotaped in individual and group trials in a temperature-controlled arena for 12min. Pups were tracked every 5s for tip-of-the-nose and base-of-the-tail coordinate positions. These positional data were transformed, using computer algorithms, into measures of activity, change in orientation, distance moved, cells occupied, wall contact, number of corners visited, and degree of aggregation. Analysis of these data revealed some phenotypic differences among genotypes for 7-day-old pups in individual trials, but there was no clear pattern of genotypic differences. By day 10, however, there were dramatic differences. AVP deficient pups differed significantly from both +/+ and +/di pups on most individual and group metrics. As measured by effect size, group effects were especially large. The behavioral results were consistent with previous findings in adult di/di rats and indicated that 10-day-old di/di pups were hyperactive and had social deficits. AVP deficient pups also appeared to have accelerated locomotor development and to exhibit stereotypic behavior. These results suggest that Brattleboro, di/di, pups are a potentially important animal model for investigating the role of AVP in early locomoter and social development. These behavioral metrics are generalizable to infants of other rodent species and thus may allow early behavioral phenotyping and the assessment of behavioral deficits."
"The tonic immobility state (TIS) in rabbit has great potential as an animal model of hypnosis in humans, due to the strong similarities between TIS and hypnosis. It is additionally the only mammalian model available for studying mechanisms of hypnosis. However, its ability to modulate pain perception has yet to be clearly determined. The present experiment examined the effect of nociceptive conditioning in normal, TIS and lidocaine-treated rabbits. This involved three separate phases. In phase one all animals were trained on a continuous performance test (CPT). In the second phase animals were given Pavlovian conditioning to an auditory CS paired with a nociceptive US. In the third phase the animals are given a sensory recognition test. The control group were conditioned during a normal state, the TIS group were conditioned during TIS, the pain control animals were conditioned after lidocaine injection in the skin area stimulated by the nociceptive US. All animals in the normal group showed the greatest amount of pain conditioning, with an average disruption time (dt) of 175s. Animals in the lidocaine group showed little signs of conditioning with an average dt of 16s. Animals conditioned during TIS had an average dt of 42s. These results show that TIS can modulate pain perception similar to animals that did not experience a pain CS. They additionally argue that tonic immobility can produce attenuation of pain perception similar to hypnosis in humans."
"Amphetamine produces its rewarding effects by enhancing dopamine transmission in the mesocorticolimbic pathway. Several studies have also suggested the involvement of the endogenous opioid system in mediating the neurochemical and behavioural effects of amphetamine. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the unselective opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (NTX) on reinstatement of amphetamine self-administration in the rat. Animals were trained to self-administer amphetamine under a fixed ratio 1 (FR1) schedule (0.1mg/kg/infusion). After receiving a stable drug intake the amphetamine was replaced with saline and the animals went through an extinction period. After reaching the extinction criteria, animals were pre-treated with NTX (0, 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0mg/kg, s.c.) 30min before giving a priming dose of amphetamine (0.5mg/kg s.c). To study the effects of NTX on operant behaviour, animals were trained to lever press for food pellets under a FR1 schedule of reinforcement. Results from the present study shows that a single injection of amphetamine reinstated self-administration behaviour. NTX (0.3 and 1.0mg/kg) significantly attenuated the amphetamine-induced reinstatement but NTX had no effect at any dose studied on food taking behaviour. These results show that NTX attenuates reinstatement of amphetamine self-administration in rats without suppressing general behaviour, implicating a functional role for opioid receptors in modulating amphetamine seeking behaviour."
"Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience. We demonstrated the crucial role of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the negative affective component of somatic and visceral pain induced by intraplantar formalin and intraperitoneal acetic acid injections, respectively, in rats. Recently, we reported the involvement of enhanced noradrenergic transmission via beta-adrenoceptors within the ventral BNST (vBNST) in formalin-induced aversion. Here, we examined the role of intra-vBNST noradrenergic transmission in the negative affective component of visceral pain induced by intraperitoneal acetic acid injection. In vivo microdialysis showed that extracellular noradrenaline levels within the vBNST significantly increased after intraperitoneal acetic acid injection. Using a conditioned place aversion (CPA) test, we found that intra-vBNST injection of timolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, dose-dependently attenuated the acetic acid-induced CPA without reducing nociceptive behaviors. These results suggest that enhanced noradrenergic transmission via beta-adrenoceptors within the vBNST plays a pivotal role in the negative affective, but not sensory, component of visceral pain."
"Although genetically closely related AB-Halle (ABH) and AB-Gatersleben (ABG) mice inbred strains differ in activity and aggressive behaviour. These behavioural traits have been observed especially in response to social challenges, where ABH mice develop a highly aggressive and active behaviour, which cannot be observed in their ABG counterparts. In contrast to ABG mice, basal brain serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline concentrations in ABH mice are low but highly stimulated by social challenges. Since brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) modulates central neurotransmitter systems and has been involved in aggressive and activity behaviour, we studied specific concentrations of BDNF and NGF protein in several brain regions of ABG and ABH mice. A significant higher concentration of BDNF protein was found in the hippocampus of 5 weeks and 5 months old ABH mice, when compared to ABG mice. BDNF was also higher in the cortex of 5 weeks and 5 months old ABH mice. Moreover BDNF concentrations were higher in the striatum of 5 months old ABH mice when compared to ABG mice. NGF concentrations in ABH mice were not changed in all measured brain regions but higher in older age in the hippocampus of ABG mice as compared to ABH mice. We hypothesize, that BDNF might be involved in the behavioural and neurochemical mechanisms of aggressive behaviour."
"Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is an orexigenic and dipsogenic neuropeptide that has been reported to mediate acute behavioral and neuroendocrine stress-related responses via MCH(1) receptor activation in rodents. The purpose of the present investigation was to use the MCH(1) receptor antagonist SNAP 94847 (N-(3-{1-[4-(3,4-difluoro-phenoxy)-benzyl]-piperidin-4-yl}-4-methyl-phenyl)-isobutyramide) to determine the effects of MCH(1) receptor blockade on MCH-evoked adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release, chronic mild stress-induced anhedonia, stress-induced hyperthermia and forced swim stress-induced immobility. The appropriate dose range for testing SNAP 94847 was determined by measuring MCH-evoked water drinking. The corresponding occupancy of MCH(1) receptors in rat striatum was also measured across a broad dose range. Orally administered (p.o.) SNAP 94847 (1-10 mg/kg) corresponds to 30-60% occupancy at MCH(1) receptors and significantly blocks water drinking induced by the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of MCH. MCH (i.c.v.) significantly elevates plasma levels of ACTH in rats, and SNAP 94847 (2.5 mg/kg, p.o.) blocks MCH-evoked ACTH release. Using the chronic mild stress paradigm, we show that repeated daily exposure to environmental stressors for 5 weeks significantly suppresses sucrose intake in rats, and that SNAP 94847 (1 mg/kg, BID) for 1-5 weeks restores baseline sucrose intake. Moreover, a single administration of SNAP 94847 attenuates stress-induced hyperthermia and the behavioral effects of forced swim stress with minimal effective doses of 2.5 and 30 mg/kg (p.o.), respectively. The regulation of ACTH release and reversal of the effects of chronic and acute stress by SNAP 94847 are suggestive of a role for MCH(1) receptor blockade in the treatment of disorders characterized by high allostatic load."
"Evidences from studies using electrical or chemical stimulation of the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) suggest that whereas the dorsal PAG is critical for the regulation of panic-related defensive behaviors, the ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG) modulates generalized anxiety-related responses. In the present study we evaluated whether the activation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/2C receptors in the ventrolateral column of the periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) causes differential effects on an anxiety- and a panic-related defensive behavior, respectively, inhibitory avoidance and escape, in male Wistar rats submitted to the elevated T-maze. Our results showed that intra-vlPAG injection of the endogenous agonist serotonin, the 5-HT1A/7 agonist 8-OH-DPAT or 5-HT2A/2C agonist DOI impaired the acquisition of inhibitory avoidance, without interfering with escape performance. The same selective anxiolytic effect was also observed after local administration of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam. Moreover, as shown by the results of antagonism studies, 5-HT2A receptors are recruited for the anxiolysis caused by serotonin and DOI, while 5-HT1A receptors account for the effect of 8-OH-DPAT. In conclusion, our data show that the activation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors in the vlPAG affects defensive responses related to generalized anxiety, but not panic disorder."
"Models of selective attention predict that focused attention to spatially contiguous stimuli may result in enhanced activity in areas of cortex specialized for processing task-relevant and task-irrelevant information. We examined this hypothesis by localizing color-sensitive areas (CSA) and word and letter sensitive areas of cortex and then examining modulation of these regions during performance of a modified version of the Stroop task in which target and distractors are spatially coincident. We report that only the incongruent condition with the highest cognitive demand showed increased activity in CSA relative to other conditions, indicating an attentional enhancement in target processing areas. We also found an enhancement of activity in one region sensitive to word/letter processing during the most cognitively demanding incongruent condition indicating greater processing of the distractor dimension. Correlations with performance revealed that top-down modulation during the task was critical for effective filtering of irrelevant information in conflict conditions. These results support predictions made by models of selective attention and suggest an important mechanism of top-down attentional control in spatially contiguous stimuli."
"Some clinical studies have shown that anxiety disorders are often associated with drug dependence, although it remains unclear whether these disorders are primary or secondary to drug abuse. We have investigated whether anxiety may be a factor that predisposes to cocaine use. From an outbred Wistar strain, we have selected male rats regarded as anxious or non-anxious on the basis of their scores on two behavioural tests of unconditioned anxiety, the elevated plus-maze and the light/dark box test. They were also screened for their locomotor activity in an inescapable novel environment and for their preference for novelty presented in a free-choice. Rewarding effects of cocaine (2.5-20 mg/kg; i.p.) were then determined in the conditioned place preference paradigm (CPP). Anxious and non-anxious rats showed no difference in their responsiveness to inescapable novelty or their preference for novelty in a free-choice procedure. Only anxious rats developed a CPP induced by increasing doses of cocaine, the magnitude of CPP induced by the 10 mg/kg dose of cocaine being significantly higher than that observed in anxious rats conditioned with saline. These results suggest that anxiety affects the sensitivity to aversive/anxiogenic effects of cocaine. Thus, anxious rats which were highly responsive to positive effects of cocaine may be more prone to develop cocaine addiction than non-anxious rats."
We investigated the role of dopaminergic mechanisms in the attenuation of the acoustic startle response and prepulse inhibition (PPI) in rats by the introduction of unexpected changes in environment illumination. Experiment 1 showed that Dark-to-Light transitions robustly reduce startle responses and PPI. Experiment 2 showed that this phenomenon habituates across repeated testing sessions and reappears after an interval without testing. Experiment 3 demonstrated that haloperidol blocks the startle and PPI-reducing effect of the Dark-to-Light transition. We show how a computational model of acoustic startle response and prepulse inhibition can be extended to incorporate the empirical effects demonstrated in this study. We conclude that sensory gating as measured by prepulse inhibition is markedly attenuated in situations where novel stimuli are introduced during a test session and that dopaminergic systems may be involved in the dynamic changes evoked by the onset of illumination.
"Since their return from the first Persian Gulf War, some veterans have complained of a variety of symptoms that were designated as ""Gulf War Illness"" (GWI). Among other factors, pyridostigmine, used as a prophylaxis treatment against intoxication by nerve agents, has been proposed by many authors as a cause of late social and/or cognitive dysfunction related to GWI. One of the hypotheses placed to explain these behavioural disorders is that operational stress has modified the side effects of pyridostigmine given to soldiers. In an attempt to establish an experimental model of GWI to evaluate the long-term behavioural effects of pyridostigmine administered in stressful conditions, we have developed a new model of repeated stress based on the pole-climbing avoidance technique. We used it to evaluate the effects of pyridostigmine treatment combined to repeated stress over the months following the end of the treatment. We observed that this stress induces impulsiveness and aggressiveness in adult male rat. Moreover, pyridostigmine treatment administered daily 30 min before each stressful session amplifies these behavioural disorders and induces long-term learning dysfunction and slight but significant decrease in phosphocholine level in hippocampus. This suggests that repeated administration of pyridostigmine combined to pole-climbing avoidance (PCA) stress conditions can induce adverse effects in rat central nervous system."
"Organophosphates (OP) represent a potential threat in terrorism or during military conflicts. Due to its faculty to protect cholinesterase (ChE) activity against irreversible inactivation by OP, pyridostigmine bromide (PB) was used as a prophylaxis treatment during the first Persian Gulf War. To explain dysfunctions reported by Gulf War Veterans (GWV), it was suggested a potentiation of the operational stress effects by PB given to soldiers. Our companion paper (see part 1 in the same journal issue) describes that PB treatment administered in repeated stress conditions results in long-term perturbations of learning and social behaviour. The present paper examines, in adult male Wistar rats, consequences of the association of repeated stress and PB treatment on gene expression in hypothalamus and hippocampus. PB treatment (1.5 mg/kg/day) was orally administered 30 min before each stress session to inhibit 40% of blood ChE as recommended by NATO. 10 days of stress alone induce a decrease in hypothalamic Il-1alpha expression. Treatment with PB alone increases mineralocorticoid receptor expression in hypothalamus which means that PB may thus modify stress perception by animals. Stressed-PB animals showed increase in hippocampal expression of BDNF, TrkB and CamKIIalpha, three genes implicated in memory development. As a supplement to previous studies showing behavioural and biochemical effects of the association of stress with PB, our data reveal that behavioural effects of this association may be linked with genomic changes in hippocampus. Mechanisms underlying these modifications and their link with memory disturbances reported by GWV remain to be further determined."
"Previous studies suggest that laterality of the viscera, morphological asymmetries of the brain, and lateralization of cognitive functions have a common genetic origin. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an artificial selection experiment for behavioural lateralization of eye use in two strains (TL and GT) of zebrafish (Danio rerio), maintaining one selected line in each strain for five generations. In addition, we investigated, using molecular markers, whether there was any correlation among directionality in eye preference, diencephalic left-right asymmetries in the brain and positioning of the viscera. After one generation of selection, the right- and left-eye lines of both strains showed a significant difference in the behavioural trait. This difference was maintained for all the five generations even though we observed a progressive decline in the response to artificial selection in subsequent generations for both strains. Overall, anatomical evidence suggests that selection for right-eye use significantly increased the frequency of reversed asymmetry in the epithalamus while selection for left-eye use decreased it. However, the response was irregular since not all samples conformed to this pattern. The association between the direction of behavioural selection and pancreas position was less clear-cut, although the concordance between visceral and brain asymmetries exceeded 90% in both strains."
"Sleep deprivation alters mood and anxiety in man. In rats, 24 h of treadmill-induced total sleep deprivation or sleep fragmentation increased exploratory behavior in an open field test of anxiety compared to cage or exercise controls. Plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels of sleep disturbed and exercise control rats were elevated compared to cage controls, suggesting that the increased exploration observed in the sleep disturbed rats was not due to a hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress response."
"Until the second half of the 20th century, it was broadly accepted that most birds are microsmatic if not anosmic and unable to detect and use olfactory information. Exceptions were eventually conceded for species like procellariiforms, vultures or kiwis that detect their food at least in part based on olfactory signals. During the past 20-30 years, many publications have appeared indicating that this view is definitely erroneous. We briefly review here anatomical, electrophysiological and behavioral data demonstrating that birds in general possess a functional olfactory system and are able to use olfactory information in a variety of ethological contexts, including reproduction. Recent work also indicates that brain activation induced by sexual interactions with a female is significantly affected by olfactory deprivation in Japanese quail. Brain activation was measured via immunocytochemical detection of the protein product of the immediate early gene c-fos. Changes observed concerned two brain areas that play a key role in the control of male sexual behavior, the medial preoptic nucleus and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis therefore suggesting a potential role of olfaction in the control of reproduction. The widespread idea that birds are anosmic or microsmatic is thus not supported by the available experimental data and presumably originates in our anthropomorphic view that leads us to think that birds do not smell because they have a rigid beak and nostrils and do not obviously sniff. Experimental analysis of this phenomenon is thus warranted and should lead to a significant change in our understanding of avian biology."
"Short 50-kilohertz (kHz) range frequency-modulated ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) produced by rats and mice are unconditionally elicited by drugs of abuse or electrical stimulation that increase dopamine activity in the nucleus accumbens, and it has been suggested that they reflect ""positive affect"" or incentive motivational states associated with appetitive behavior. The repeated administration of amphetamine is known to not only produce ""psychomotor"" sensitization, but also to facilitate a number of appetitive behaviors, including conditioned drug pursuit behavior. We were interested, therefore, in whether amphetamine-induced 50-kHz USVs would also increase with repeated drug exposure. USV recordings were made during 5-min sessions immediately after a saline infusion, and again 4-5h later after 1.0mg/kg intravenous amphetamine exposure. These sessions took place every other day over a 5-day period. A challenge dose of 1.0mg/kg amphetamine was administered 2 weeks later to determine whether sensitization would persist. The initial amphetamine infusion increased 50-kHz USVs relative to the saline infusion. This effect was enhanced over trials and during the amphetamine challenge 2 weeks later. Classification of 50-kHz range call types revealed that complex frequency-modulated trill calls were sensitized by amphetamine, but not flat 50-kHz calls. It is possible that 50-kHz USV recordings could provide a potentially valuable behavioral measure of sensitization linked to enhanced incentive salience and increased tendency to self-administer drugs of abuse."
"Treatment with ginsenosides attenuated KA-induced seizures and oxidative stress in the synaptosome, and reduced synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic terminals dose-dependently. The adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonist 1,3,7-trimethyl-8-(3-chlorostyryl) xanthine reversed the ginsenoside-mediated pharmacological actions. Neither the adenosine A(1) receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine nor the adenosine A(2B) receptor antagonist alloxazine affected the ginsenoside-mediated pharmacological actions. Our results suggest that ginsenosides block KA-induced synaptosomal oxidative stress, associated with hippocampal degeneration, through activation of adenosine A(2A) receptors."
"Sodium butyrate (NaB), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, has been implicated in the antidepressant-like effects either injected as a single drug or in combination with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), such as fluoxetine. Estrogen is also demonstrated to have antidepressant effect especially together with fluoxetine. We investigated whether NaB administered in combination with estradiol benzoate (EB) exerted antidepressant-like effect in forced swimming test (FST) in ovariectomized female rats. Furthermore, we detected the mRNA expressions of serotonin receptors and neuropeptides in hypothalamus, both of which participate in the mood disorder. Ovariectomized female SD rats were treated with vehicle, NaB, EB or NaB combined with EB for 7 days and then subjected to FST. The expressions of serotonin receptors (5-hydroxytryptamine receptor), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) mRNA in the hypothalamus were detected by real time PCR. We found that co-treated with NaB and EB resulted in a significant decrease in immobility behavior in FST, a measure for depression-like behavioral. 5-HT(1A) antagonist, WAY 100635, significantly block the antidepressant-like effects induced by NaB plus EB. The mRNA expression of the serotonin-1A [5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT(1A))] receptor was increased in the co-treated group in hypothalamus, while there was no difference in the mRNA expression of 5-HT(2A) or 5-HT(2C). The mRNA expression of CRH or AVP was not significantly altered either. In conclusion, NaB may exert antidepressant-like effects in combination with EB in ovariectomized female rats through 5-HT(1A) receptor, via altering the expression of 5-HT(1A) in the hypothalamus."
"Topographical orientation relies on the integrity of several cognitive functions and different strategies that individuals may adopt while navigating in the environment. Although previous studies have shown an age-related decline in navigational ability, these have not clarified the precise function or strategy that is affected. We hypothesized that aging may have an adverse effect on the ability to form and use a 'cognitive map', a mental representation of the environment. We had young and older participants solve a navigational task in a virtual environment designed to assess cognitive map use. Older participants required more time to form a cognitive map of the environment than young individuals and required more time and made more errors when subsequently using the cognitive map for orientation. These results suggest that decreased efficacy in both forming and using cognitive maps makes a significant contribution to the age-related decline in orientation skills."
"Failure of the ubiquitin-proteasome system to degrade abnormal proteins may underlie the accumulation of alpha-synuclein and dopaminergic neuronal degeneration that occurs in Parkinson's disease. Consequently, a reduction of functional proteasome activity has been implicated in Parkinson's disease. VP025 (Vasogen Inc.) is a preparation of phospholipid nanoparticles incorporating phosphatidylglycerol that has been shown to have neuroprotective effects. We show that VP025 prevents the deficits in motor coordination and dopamine observed in a proteasome inhibitor rat model of PD. Thus, VP025 may have a therapeutic effect on the impairment of dopaminergic-mediated motor activity induced by proteasome inhibition."
"It has been proposed that developmental plasticity of anxiety and stress responses in rodents is mediated by environment-dependent variations in maternal behaviour, but recent evidence indicates that other factors must be involved. To examine this further, we exposed lactating C57BL/6 mice to environmental conditions that imposed high- (HFD), low- (LFD) or variable-foraging demand (VFD) from postnatal day 1-13, depending on the amount and predictability of food supply. While nest attendance was unaffected by treatment, both HFD and VFD-dams showed increased active maternal care compared to LFD-dams. Anxiety in adult male and female offspring was examined on an elevated-O-maze (EZM) and in the open-field test, while hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) reactivity to 20min novelty/isolation stress was determined based on changes in plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels. There were no persistent treatment effects on the offspring's CORT response to novelty/isolation stress. However VFD-males, but not HFD-males, behaved more anxious than LFD males. Their reduced activities throughout the behavioural tests are indicative of a more passive coping style. Conversely, VFD-females, but not HFD-females, behaved less anxious than LFD-females. Our results demonstrate (1) that maternal behaviour in C57BL/6 mice is sensitive to specific characteristics of the environment, (2) that even subtle environment-dependent variations in maternal behaviour can have persistent effects on the offspring's behavioural phenotype, (3) that other factors besides active maternal care must have contributed to these effects, and (4) that male and female offspring may be differentially sensitive to early maternal and/or environmental cues."
"Several lines of evidence suggest that exploring the neurochemical basis of reward in invertebrate species may provide clues for the fundamental behavioral and neurobiology underpinnings of drug addiction. How the presence of drug-sensitive reward relates to a decrease in drug-seeking behavior and reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior in invertebrate systems is not known. The present study of a conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm in crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) explores morphine-induced reward, extinction and reinstatement. Repeated intra-circulatory infusions of 2.5 microg/g, 5.0 microg/g and 10.0 microg/g doses of morphine over 5 days serve as a reward when paired with a distinct visual or tactile environment. Morphine-induced CPP was extinguished after repeated saline injections for 5 days in the previously morphine-paired compartment. After the previously established CPP had been eliminated during the extinction phase, morphine-experienced crayfish were challenged with 2.5 microg/g, 5.0 microg/g and 10.0 microg/g, respectively. The priming injections of morphine reinstated CPP in all training doses, suggesting that morphine-induced CPP is unrelenting, and that with time, it can be reinstated by morphine following extinction in an invertebrate model just like in mammals. Together with other recent studies, this work demonstrates the advantage of using crayfish as an invertebrate animal model to investigate the basic biological processes that underline exposure to mammalian drugs of abuse."
"Several existing theoretical models of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) predict that a high or low learning rate contributes to some cases of ADHD; and that this is controlled by the dopamine signal. The Spontaneously Hypertensive (Hyperactive) Rat has an abnormal Dopamine Transporter (DAT), which is likely to be hypofunctional, thereby increasing the dopamine concentration and the learning rate. We therefore test the prediction that the SHR learns too fast. Using a variable interval reinforcement schedule, we looked for increased responding within each interval, at around the durations of the last three intervals. At the time predicted by the previous interval, SHR responded significantly (10%) more than their baseline rate, and control WKY rats similarly less than their baseline. At the time predicted by the second (and third) previous intervals, there were minor trends (and no change) in the same direction. In summary, at the times predicted, SHR respond more than control rats. The effect size is insufficient to account for all the differences from control rats, such as their nearly threefold greater operant responding. At the times when SHR increase responding, WKY suppress it. This demonstrates similar learning to the SHR but the opposite response, probably due to anxiety about the bang accompanying reinforcer delivery: WKY are known to have a very negative response to stress. Interval schedules with randomised interval lengths have considerable potential for assessing multiple causes of behaviour, particularly those acting over short timecourses. Alterations in learning rate are not a sufficient explanation for either SHR or ADHD difference from controls."
"An important aspect of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is its temporary amelioration by novelty and by stimulant medication. Extant learning-based accounts of ADHD are unable to account for the temporary amelioration effect. One possible mechanism is a drive for novelty. Computational simulations have previously shown that such a drive can result from a ""dopamine appetite"". Empirical demonstration of such a process requires, as a first step, the development of standard criteria for identifying drive-based, versus learning-based, changes in behaviour. Using a variable-interval reinforcement schedule, we looked over a range of timescales for behavioural changes showing putative characteristics of drives, namely: low information content, unidirectionality, saturability, spontaneous reversibility in less than a day, and cycle stability. SHR lacks normal down-regulation of responding when the schedule becomes sparser. SHR appears to be re-learning the schedule length during the days of each calendar week. SHR hyperactivity is specific to the operant and develops gradually over the first five minutes of each session. Empirical within-session results were replicated by a simple simulation containing two interacting reward systems, one for water and the other for stimulation (including novelty). To summarise, enhanced sensation-seeking (or a subtype of it, novelty-seeking) provides the best available account of changes in SHR activity within sessions, though not of changes over longer timecourses. Sensation-seeking appears to be associated with low anxiety in the SHR. SHR propensity to display multiple influences on their behaviour makes them ideal for further pharmacological, genetic, and behavioural investigation."
"Variable intervals are widely believed to produce steady rates of responding. However, based on the calming effect of unpredictability in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) we hypothesised that an animal model of this disorder, the Spontaneously Hyperactive (or Hypertensive) Rat, would become less active following particularly variable sequences of interval-lengths in a variable interval schedule. From a large dataset of holepokes and tray-reports by rats in a variable interval reinforcement schedule, we extracted numerous short sequences of intervals on the basis of the first, second, and third derivatives of reinforcement timing (i.e. rate, acceleration, and jerk) in recent intervals. Sets of selected intervals were compared with one another to elucidate the effect of these different derivatives on behaviour in the current interval. Results show that SHR are more active after richer recent reinforcement; after decelerating reinforcers; and after predictable reinforcers. The hypothesis is supported. In conclusion, SHR behaviour largely complies with the Extended Temporal Difference model which in turn has been previously validated against published data in ADHD. The Extended TD model therefore is able to account for two species' behaviour in a wide range of experimental paradigms. SHR are similar in several respects to group averages of children with ADHD, except that SHR have reduced variability and perform actions faster than controls. Hyperactivity in the SHR is very dependent on momentary environmentally determined states, which is an important area for future investigation of ADHD."
"We have studied the effect of the lesion of the dopaminergic innervation of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRn) on anxiety and motor behaviour. The lesion of the dopamine innervation was produced by the injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the dorsal part of the thalamic reticular nucleus. The lesion decreased the number of TH (+) cells of the pars compacta of substantia nigra by 33%, without modifying the number of TH (+) cells in ventral tegmental area. The lesion increased the time spent by the rats on the open arms of the elevated plus maze and decreased the duration of burying in the shock-probe test. Both results suggest reduced anxiety. The loss of the dopamine innervation to the TRn decreased the number of rearings but did not significantly affect total motor activity, gait or motor coordination, as evidenced by rotarod performance. These findings suggest that dopamine in the TRn plays a role in fear-related behaviour."
"High-frequency cortical activity in humans and animals has been linked to a wide variety of higher cognitive processes. This research suggests that specific changes in neuronal synchrony occur during cognitive processing, distinguished by emergence of fast oscillations in the gamma frequency range. To determine whether the development of high-frequency brain oscillations can be related to the development of cognitive abilities, we studied the power spectra of resting EEG in children 16, 24 and 36 months of age. Individual differences in the distribution of frontal gamma power during rest were highly correlated with concurrent language and cognitive skills at all ages. Gamma power was also associated with attention measures; children who were observed as having better inhibitory control and more mature attention shifting abilities had higher gamma power density functions. We included a group of children with a family history of language impairment (FH+) and thus at higher risk for language disorders. FH+ children, as a group, showed consistently lower gamma over frontal regions than the well-matched FH- controls with no such family history (FH-). We suggest that the emergence of high-frequency neural synchrony may be critical for cognitive and linguistic development, and that children at risk for language impairments may lag in this process."
"A typical open field consists of a square enclosure, bounded by four straight walls joined by identical corners. For decades behavioral researchers have used the open center and more sheltered perimeter of such fields to examine the effects of drugs, sex differences, and illumination on the behavioral expression of fear and anxiety. The present study ""reversed"" the relative security of the center and periphery of a circular field to re-examine the functional relation of open field behavior to experience, sex differences and lighting. Across six daily exposures, males in both the light and dark rapidly increased their preference for the center. Females in the light developed a similar pattern, though more slowly; females in the dark continued to spend the great majority of their time in the open periphery, including the edge of the field. The behavior of all groups, but especially the dark females, strongly supports the continued importance of environmental assessment in open field behavior."
"We present a 2-day water maze protocol that addresses some of potential confounds present in the water maze when using the aged subjects typical of studies of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. This protocol is based on an initial series of training trials with a visible platform, followed by a memory test with a hidden platform 24h later. We validated this procedure using aged (15-18m) mice expressing three Alzheimer's disease-related transgenes, PS1(M146 V), APP(Swe), and tau(P301L). We also tested these triple transgenic mice (3xTG) and age and sex-matched wild-type (WT) in a behavioral battery consisting of tests of motor coordination (balance beam), spatial memory (object displacement task) visual acuity (novel object recognition task) and locomotor activity (open field). 3xTG mice had significantly longer escape latencies in the memory trial of the 2-day water maze test than WT and than their own baseline performance in the last visible platform trial. In addition, this protocol had improved sensitivity compared to a typical probe trial, since no significant differences between genotypes were evident in a probe trial conducted 24h after the final training trial. The 2-day procedure also resulted in good reliability between cohorts, and controlled for non-cognitive factors that can confound water maze assessments of memory, such as the significantly lower locomotor activity evident in the 3xTG mice. A further benefit of this method is that large numbers of animals can be tested in a short time."
"Rats are polyphasic sleepers. However, a formal definition of when one sleep episode ends and another begins has not been put forth. In the present study we examine the distribution of wake episode durations and based on this distribution conclude there are multiple components of wake. If the wake episode exceeds 300 s the wake episode is assigned to long-duration wake (LDW), if the episode is less than 300 s it is assigned to brief wake (BW). Further support for this separation was found in close analysis of the EEG power spectrum in BW versus LDW. We then used LDW episodes to separate one sleep episode from another. We term the sleep episodes vigilance cycling (VC) because the rat is cycling between the vigilance states of BW, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and rapid-eye movement sleep (REMS). We find that the characteristics of VC are different in the light period versus the dark period. We further find that as VC episodes progress, SWS pressure lessens, but the amount of time spent in REMS increases. These findings suggest that VC episodes are regulated and meaningful to the sleep behavior of rats. The use of the concepts of LDW and VC provides additional insights into the description of sleep patterns in rats that may be important in the development of a complete description of sleep behavior in this animal."
"Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is released from the gastrointestinal tract following ingestion and causes satiety in mammals. Its effects on appetite in non-mammalian vertebrates are unreported. In Experiment 1, fasted chicks reduced food and water intake after central injection of CGRP. These effects were not associated with increased plasma corticosterone concentration. In Experiment 2, we showed that the effect on water intake was independent of food intake. In Experiment 3, central CGRP caused increased c-Fos immunoreactivity in the arcuate (ARC) nucleus, paraventricular nucleus (PVN), periventricular (PHN) and ventromedial (VMH) hypothalamic nuclei. The results of Experiment 4 demonstrate that intraperitoneal injection of CGRP also causes reduced food and water intake. c-Fos immunoreactivity was increased in the ARC, PHN, PVN and VMH in Experiment 5 after intraperitoneal injection of CGRP. Lastly in Experiment 6, we showed that central CGRP changes the type of pecks from feeding to exploratory, and reduces the number of escape attempts. The effect of CGRP appears to be primary on appetite in chicks. In conclusion, the mechanisms of CGRP induced satiety have some similarities and differences between avian and rodent models. The results presented here provide new insight into the evolution of vertebrate satiety regulatory mechanisms."
"Previous research has shown that basal forebrain cholinergic inputs to the cerebral cortex are necessary for attentional processing. However, the key components of attention-demanding tasks for demonstrating deficits following loss of basal forebrain corticopetal cholinergic neurons are unclear. In the present experiment, rats were trained in a visual cued discrimination task with limited explicit attentional demands and then received intrabasalis infusions of the immunotoxin, 192 IgG-saporin, or saline. Postsurgically, attentional demands were increased by decreasing the signal duration or the intertrial interval or by increasing the variability of these parameters. Subsequently, rats were trained in a task that required discrimination of successively presented signals and ""blank"" trials with no signal presentation. Again, attentional demands were increased by manipulating signal duration or the intertrial interval. Finally, all rats were trained in a task with both the signal duration and the intertrial interval designed to increase attentional demands. Compared to sham-lesioned animals, lesioned animals exhibited deficits in signal detection only during the successive discrimination task with both the signal duration and intertrial interval shorter and variable. The present data suggest that attentional deficits following loss of cortical cholinergic inputs result from overall attentional task demands rather than being dependent on any single task parameter."
"The dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) system has been implicated in emotional processing which is often impaired in neuropsychiatric disorders. The long (D2L) and the short (D2S) isoforms of D2R are generated by alternative splicing of the same gene. To study differential roles of the two D2R isoforms, D2L-deficient mice (D2L-/-) expressing functional D2S were previously generated. In this study the contribution of D2L isoform to emotional response was investigated by examining behaviors that reflect emotionality (exploratory behavior, anxiety-like behavior and learned helplessness) in D2L-/- and (wild-type) WT mice. While the thigmotactic, locomotor and general components of anxiety in zero maze did not differ among the genotypes, D2L-/- mice displayed significantly lower level of exploration in a hole board and zero maze, and significantly higher increase in latency to escape from a foot-shock after the learned helplessness training, compared with WT mice. These results suggest that D2L may play a more prominent role than D2S in mediating emotional response, such as behavioral reactions to novelty and inescapable stress. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying emotional responses."
"Three experiments examined whether a drug state serving as a positive feature for pairings between a discrete conditional stimulus (CS, 15-s light or 15-s noise) and sucrose could transfer facilitative control to a CS with which it had never been presented. To do so, a CS was paired with a sucrose reward in the nicotine (0.4 mg/kg), amphetamine (AMP, 1mg/kg), or chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 5mg/kg) drug state; in separate saline sessions the CS was presented but was not followed by any reward. All three drug states facilitated responding to a discrete CS; previous studies found that this facilitation did not depend on direct associations between the drug state and sucrose. When a second discrimination was trained (e.g., CDP: light-sucrose and nicotine: noise-sucrose) the drug states facilitated responding to the CS trained in that state (nicotine: noise) as well as the CS normally presented in the other drug state (e.g., nicotine: light). A novel drug state (e.g., amphetamine) did not affect responding to either CS, indicating that the originally trained drug states had acquired functional similarity based on learning history. Also, a novel or ambiguous CS did not evoke responding in the previously trained drug state, indicating that both the features (drug states) and target conditional stimuli had to be trained in discriminations before transfer could occur."
"Daily routines in animal activities range from sleep-wake cycles, to foraging bouts, to social interactions. Among animals living within groups, it is unclear whether the motivations that underlie social interactions respond to daily light-dark (LD) cycles or endogenous circadian rhythms. Employing two mouse strains (BALB/cJ [BALB] and C57BL/6J [B6]) with genetically based differences in social affect and circadian rhythms, we examined how social investigation (SI) is modulated by social deprivation and circadian factors. We found a genetic influence on SI that was moderated by the preceding duration of social deprivation, requiring 3-6 h of social isolation prior to testing. Following 6h of social deprivation, the SI responses of adolescent B6 mice were greater than those of BALB mice only when the isolation period was imposed during the dark phase of the LD cycle. When B6 mice were weaned into conditions of constant darkness, a novel, endogenous social rhythm emerged, which was characterized by two pronounced peaks of social responsiveness (relative to one peak under LD entrainment) that were separated by 12-h intervals. Irrespective of the lighting conditions during social isolation, the SI responses of adolescent BALB mice did not oscillate across the day. Similar strain-dependent patterns of sociability were evident within groups of mice that were left undisturbed in their home cage under LD entrainment or constant darkness. Overall, genetic influences on the social phenotypes of adolescent mice are thus moderated by an interaction between social deprivation and oscillations of an endogenous social rhythm that entrains to the LD cycle."
"Sex differences exist in skilled movement, and skilled motor performance is also influenced by stress. As shown for cognitive function, the effects of stress are usually characterized by considerable sexual dimorphism. The purpose of this study was to investigate sex differences in skilled motor function in response to stress. Male and female Long-Evans rats were trained and tested in skilled reaching and skilled walking tasks. Both groups of animals were then exposed to daily restraint stress for 15 days. Recovery from daily stress was assessed by comparing reaching performance at 10 min versus 60 min after restraint stress, and recovery from chronic stress was tested for 21 days after cessation of stress. Animals were tested daily in skilled reaching for the entire period. Observations showed that females performed significantly better than males during the stress period in terms of reaching success and number of attempts needed to grasp a food pellet. No difference between testing at 10 or 60 min after daily stress was found. Analysis of movement patterns and recovery from stress indicated that males and females use different strategies to overcome stress-induced motor disturbance. While male rats preferred to use original movement patterns, females tended to modify these patterns in order to increase reaching success. Modification of movement patterns in female rats was accompanied by a faster recovery in success rate after the cessation of stress. These results indicate sex differences in skilled reaching in response to stress, and in the recovery period after stress."
"Zebrafish is used in forward genetic and drug screening and is gaining popularity in behavioral brain research but high throughput learning paradigms are lacking. The sight of conspecifics has been shown to be rewarding in zebrafish. Here, in a novel paradigm, subjects learn to respond to alternating presentation of computer-animated zebrafish images. The simplicity and computerization of the paradigm will make it useful for high throughput screening."
"Leptin regulates feeding behavior and body weight by binding to its receptors localized in specific areas of the hypothalamus. Leptin injected twice daily for 4 days either into the right ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) or into the right lateral cerebral ventricle (ICV) and using Real-Time Taqman RT-PCR, mRNA expression levels of selected genes in the arcuate nucleus-median eminence (ARC-ME) complex were quantitatively measured. Expression of selected genes from the ipsi- vs. contralateral VMH areas in rats injected with leptin into the VMH was also compared. VMH injections of leptin increased ARC-ME mRNAs of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), 27.3% (p&lt;0.05); gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABRD), 89.3% (p&lt;0.01); and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), 57.7% (p&lt;0.01); and decreased janus kinase 2 (JAK2), 44.4% (p&lt;0.001); suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), 86.6% (p&lt;0.001); signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), 46.8% (p&lt;0.01); tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), 51.1% (p&lt;0.001); prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES), 96.5% (p&lt;0.001); tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), 47% (p&lt;0.01); and secretin, 55.4% (p&lt;0.001). Only GABRD, 76.6% (p&lt;0.01) and SCT, 64.9% (p&lt;0.01) were up-regulated in the hypothalamic ARC-ME of rats with ICV leptin injections. VMH injections of leptin induced identical reductions in expression levels of CART, SOCS3, PTGES, and TNF-alpha in both VMH areas; except TH mRNA, whose expression was lowered ipsilaterally. Food intake, body and fat pad weights and serum insulin and leptin were also decreased in rats given leptin through VMH. This study suggests that leptin either unilateral exposure through VMH or bilateral exposure through ICV injections induces divergent ARC-ME gene profiles."
"In the present study, the effects of low-intensity laser therapy (LILT) on naloxone-induced withdrawal signs of morphine-dependent rats were examined. Low-intensity lasers with a power density of 12.5J/cm(2) have been used by a Ga-Al-As laser. One-way ANOVA showed that the LILT which applied immediately or 15min prior to naloxone injection significantly decreased total withdrawal score (TWS). These results suggest that LILT prior to naloxone injection attenuates the expression of withdrawal signs in morphine-dependent rats. Further studies may elucidate the likely role of LILT in clinical management of opioid withdrawal syndrome."
"17beta-Estradiol (E(2)) may influence cognitive and/or affective behavior in part via the beta isoform of the estrogen receptor (ERbeta). Endocrine status and behavior in cognitive (object recognition, T-maze), anxiety (open field, elevated plus maze, mirror maze, emergence), and motor/coordination (rotarod, activity chamber) tasks of proestrous and diestrous wildtype (WT) and ERbeta knockout (betaERKO) mice was examined. Proestrous (WT or betaERKO), versus diestrous, mice had higher E(2) and progestin levels in plasma, hippocampus, and cortex. The only effect of genotype on hormone levels was for corticosterone, such that betaERKO mice had higher concentrations of corticosterone than did WT mice. Proestrous WT, but not betaERKO, mice had improved performance in the object recognition (greater percentage of time with novel object) and T-maze tasks (greater percentage of spontaneous alternations) and less anxiety-like behavior in the plus maze (increased duration on open arms) and mirror chamber task (increased duration in mirror) than did diestrous mice. This pattern was not seen in the rotarod, open field, or activity monitor, suggesting effects may be specific to affective and cognitive behavior, rather than motor behavior/coordination. Thus, enhanced performance in cognitive tasks and anti-anxiety-like behavior of proestrous mice may require actions of ERbeta in the hippocampus and/or cortex."
"Male rats, under certain experimental conditions, may show lordosis, the typical expression of female sexual receptivity. This work studies the sexual morphological pattern of facilitatory and inhibitory structures that control lordosis. Three groups of males were neonatally subjected to a gradient of androgen exposure (castrated plus injected oil (GxM+oil); castrated plus androstenedione treated (GxM+AND); and sham operated [CM]); a group of control females (CF) was also added. Lordotic response after these different hormonal and neonatal surgical treatments, as well as the volume or number of neurons in facilitatory (ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus [VMN]) and inhibitory (the intermediate region of the lateral septum [LSi] and accessory olfactory bulb [AOB]) nuclei involved in lordosis was studied in adults. The inhibition of lordosis in the males seems to be associated to the neonatal presence of testosterone and the consequent masculinization of the VMN, VMNvl, LSi and AOB. It is suggested that one of the functions of the sex differences consistently seen in these structures might be to inhibit the lordosis response in the male."
"We argue that audio-tactile interactions during vibrotactile processing provide a promising, albeit largely neglected, benchmark for the systematic study multisensory integration. This article reviews and discusses current evidence for multisensory contributions to the perception of vibratory events, and proposes a framework to address a number of relevant questions. First, we highlight some of the features that characterize the senses of hearing and touch in terms of vibratory information processing, and which allow for potential cross-modal interactions at multiple levels along the functional architecture of the sensory systems. Second, we briefly review empirical evidence for interactions between hearing and touch in the domain of vibroactile perception and related stimulus properties, covering behavioural, electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies in humans and animals. Third, we discuss the vibrotactile discrimination task, which has been successfully applied in the study of perception and decision processes in psychophysical and physiological research. We argue that this approach, complemented with computational modeling using biophysically realistic neural networks, may be a convenient framework to address auditory contributions to vibrotactile processing in the somatosensory system. Finally, we comment on a series of particular issues which are relevant in multisensory research and potentially addressable within the proposed framework."
"Rats exposed to valproic acid (VPA) on gestational day 12 (GD12) have been advanced as a rodent model of autism [Arndt TL, Stodgell, Rodier PM. The teratology of autism. Int J Dev Neurosci 2005;23: 189-99.]. These rats show cerebellar anomalies and alterations in eyeblink conditioning that are associated with autism. Autistic humans and VPA-exposed rats show normal responses to conditioned and unconditioned stimuli, but they show marked differences from comparison groups in acquisition, magnitude, and timing of the conditioned response (CR). This study examined VPA-induced eyeblink CR timing differences by training rats on an interstimulus interval (ISI) discrimination task, in which two distinct conditioned stimuli (CS; tone and light) are paired with the same unconditioned stimulus (US; periocular shock) at two distinct CS-US intervals. Previous findings suggest that this task would produce abnormally large and prematurely timed CRs for VPA-exposed rats relative to controls. Adult male Long-Evans rats that were exposed to either VPA or saline on GD 12.5 were trained on an ISI discrimination task [Brown KL, Pagani JH, Stanton ME. The ontogeny of interstimulus interval (ISI) discrimination of the conditioned eyeblink response in rats. Behav Neurosci 2006;120: 1057-70.]. In support of earlier findings, we observed early acquisition and enhanced magnitude of the CR in VPA rats compared with controls on long CS trials. VPA rats also showed prematurely timed CRs to long- CS trials, but not to short- CS trials. The ISI discrimination procedure used in the current study reveals differential timed responses in this animal model of autism not previously seen."
"Impulsivity is a core deficit of a number of neuropsychiatric disorders including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anti-social conduct disorder and drug addiction. Recent research has highlighted the multifaceted nature of impulsivity and the myriad of putative neural and psychological mechanisms thought to underpin behavioural syndromes of impaired self-control. Here we report a novel conceptualisation of impulsivity based on 'waiting' and 'stopping' efficiency with explanatory value in defining the psychological and neural basis of impulsivity and the high co-morbidity of brain disorders such as ADHD and drug addiction. Rats selected for high levels of impulsivity on a reaction time task analogous to the continuous performance test in humans exhibited correspondingly high levels of impulsive decision-making on a delay-of-reward task. The same rats, however, were unimpaired on a stop-signal task requiring inhibition of an already initiated motor response. The specific nature of this deficit in 'waiting impulsivity' was confirmed by unimpaired acquisition of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning, a putative ancillary measure of impulsive behaviour. These findings are significant in light of recent evidence linking impulsivity in rats to high levels of cocaine self-administration and development of compulsive cocaine seeking behaviour. We thus suggest that an inability to bridge delays to future rewards and reward-related stimuli is a candidate behavioural endophenotype that pre-disposes to clinical psychopathology."
"Some research indicates that explicit learning of a sequence can impair procedural learning, particularly in populations with reduced cognitive capacity. However, these studies usually do not distinguish the effects of explicit processes on procedural learning from their effects on performance. The current study demonstrates that explicit learning affects performance, but not procedural sequence learning, in healthy older adults even when sequences are complex. These findings support capacity-independent theories which propose that procedural and declarative learning operate in parallel."
"Communal nesting (CN), an early social enrichment procedure in which multiple females rear the offspring in a single nest, increases maternal care levels received by offspring and interaction with peers. It has been shown that male mice reared under CN conditions show increased social competence and propensity to social interactions at adulthood. In the present study we investigated long-term behavioural effects of CN on female offspring. Mouse pups were reared under two different experimental conditions: standard nesting (SN, where single mother rears her pups) and CN (three females rearing their pups in a single nest). At adulthood CN and SN virgin females underwent three different behavioural tests: (i) maternal induction following presentation of foster pups; (ii) social recognition test in which ultrasound vocalizations (USVs) and social investigation behaviour emitted by a resident female in the presence of a female partner were recorded; (iii) zero-maze to analyze anxiety profiles. CN females showed (i) decreased licking response in the maternal induction test accompanied by an increased sniffing response; (ii) decreased of social interest towards a novel partner (during the Retest Different phase), and decreased USV emission rate in the social recognition test; CN and SN females did not differ in the emotional responses measured in the zero-maze apparatus. As a whole these data suggest that CN rearing render female mice less reactive to social novelty."
"Gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) is a prodrug to gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and metabolises to GHB when ingested. Discrimination stimulus studies report generalisation of effects of GHB to GBL. While amnesia is one of the most commonly reported symptoms of GHB's ingestion in human users, as yet few studies have examined this effect. Although an endogenous GHB specific receptor is present in the brain, several studies have indicated that the clinical effects of exogenous doses of GBL/GHB are due to its action on GABA(B) receptors rather than on the GHB receptor. In this series of studies, New Hampshire x White leghorn cockerels were trained using a modified version of the passive avoidance learning task. Subcutaneous injections of GBL induced a memory deficit by 10 min post-training, which persisted for at least 24 h. No effect on memory was seen with administration of the specific GHB agonist NCS-356 (gamma-p-chlorophenyl-trans-4-hydroxycrotonate). The GBL-induced memory deficit appeared similar to the deficit produced by baclofen, where the antagonist facilitated learning. Additionally, GBL-induced memory deficit was ameliorated by application of a GABA(B) antagonist. The results support the hypothesis that GBL exerts its influence on memory via the GABA(B) receptor rather than by the specific GHB receptor."
"The striatum is the major division of the basal ganglia, representing the input station of the circuit and arguably the principal site within the basal ganglia where information processing occurs. Striatal activity is critically involved in motor control and learning. Many parts of the striatum are involved in reward processing and in various forms of learning and memory, such as reward-association learning. Moreover, the striatum appears to be a brain center for habit formation and is likely to be involved in advanced stages of addiction. The critical role played by the striatum in learning and cognitive processes is thought to be based on changes in neuronal activity when specific behavioral tasks are being learned. Accordingly, excitatory corticostriatal synapses onto both striatal projecting spiny neurons and interneurons are able to undergo the main forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation, long-term depression, short-term forms of intrinsic plasticity and spike timing-dependent plasticity. These specific forms of neuroplasticity allow the short-term and long-term selection and differential amplification of cortical neural signals modulating the processes of motor and behavioral selection within the basal ganglia neural circuit."
"Serotonin (5-HT) is known to play a role in the suppression of the lordosis response in males. We have previously shown that there is a sex difference in the density of 5-HT immunoreactive (5-HT-ir) fibers in the ventrolateral division of the adult ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMNvl) and that neonatal administration of estradiol (E2) increases 5-HT-ir in the female VMNvl to male-typical levels. Here we demonstrate that postnatal administration of the ERalpha agonist 1,3,5-tris(4-Hydroxyphenyl)-4-propyl-1H-pyrazole (PPT), but not the ERbeta agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN), also masculinizes 5-HT-ir in the female VMNvl, suggesting a mechanistic role for ERalpha in this process. Sexual receptivity, as ascertained by the lordosis quotient, was unaffected by either PPT or DPN treatment but nearly abolished by estradiol benzoate (EB), a synthetic estrogen with high affinity for both ERalpha and ERbeta. Collectively, these observations show that postnatal estrogens increase the density of 5-HT projections to the VMNvl via an ERalpha dependent mechanism, but that this increased inhibitory input is not sufficient to suppress the lordosis response."
"In this review we discuss the evidence that drug addiction, defined as a maladaptive compulsive habit, results from the progressive subversion by addictive drugs of striatum-dependent operant and Pavlovian learning mechanisms that are usually involved in the control over behaviour by stimuli associated with natural reinforcement. Although mainly organized through segregated parallel cortico-striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical loops involved in motor or emotional functions, the basal ganglia, and especially the striatum, are key mediators of the modulation of behavioural responses, under the control of both action-outcome and stimulus-response mechanisms, by incentive motivational processes and Pavlovian associations. Here we suggest that protracted exposure to addictive drugs recruits serial and dopamine-dependent, striato-nigro-striatal ascending spirals from the nucleus accumbens to more dorsal regions of the striatum that underlie a shift from action-outcome to stimulus-response mechanisms in the control over drug seeking. When this progressive ventral to dorsal striatum shift is combined with drug-associated Pavlovian influences from limbic structures such as the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex, drug seeking behaviour becomes established as an incentive habit. This instantiation of implicit sub-cortical processing of drug-associated stimuli and instrumental responding might be a key mechanism underlying the development of compulsive drug seeking and the high vulnerability to relapse which are hallmarks of drug addiction."
"The basal ganglia (BG) are critical for the coordination of several motor, cognitive, and emotional functions and become dysfunctional in several pathological states ranging from Parkinson's disease to Schizophrenia. Here we review principles developed within a neurocomputational framework of BG and related circuitry which provide insights into their functional roles in behavior. We focus on two classes of models: those that incorporate aspects of biological realism and constrained by functional principles, and more abstract mathematical models focusing on the higher level computational goals of the BG. While the former are arguably more ""realistic"", the latter have a complementary advantage in being able to describe functional principles of how the system works in a relatively simple set of equations, but are less suited to making specific hypotheses about the roles of specific nuclei and neurophysiological processes. We review the basic architecture and assumptions of these models, their relevance to our understanding of the neurobiological and cognitive functions of the BG, and provide an update on the potential roles of biological details not explicitly incorporated in existing models. Empirical studies ranging from those in transgenic mice to dopaminergic manipulation, deep brain stimulation, and genetics in humans largely support model predictions and provide the basis for further refinement. Finally, we discuss possible future directions and possible ways to integrate different types of models."
"Aversive and safe taste memory processing is dramatically disrupted by bilateral lesions of the pontine parabrachial nucleus (PBN). To determine how such lesions affect patterns of neuronal activation in forebrain, lesions were combined with assessment of cFos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) in insular cortex (IC) and amygdala after conditioned taste aversion (CTA) training. Increases in FLI in amygdala and IC, which are normally seen following novel (versus familiar) CS-US pairing, were eliminated after PBN lesions. This suggests that PBN lesions prevent transmission of critical CS and US information to forebrain regions for the processing of both aversive and safe taste memories. Unilateral asymmetrical lesions of PBN and IC blocked CTA acquisition as well as normal patterns of FLI in amygdala after novel CS-US pairing, an effect not seen when unilateral lesions were confined to a single hemisphere. The crossed-disconnection experiments provide compelling evidence that functional interactions between PBN and IC are required for CTA acquisition, but not for safe taste memory formation and retrieval. The dissociation between effects of the different types of lesions on safe and aversive taste memories supports emerging evidence that the neural underpinnings of the two types of taste learning differ."
"High concentrations of ethylmalonic acid (EMA) are found in tissues and biological fluids of patients affected by ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE), as well as by deficiency of short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) activity and other illnesses characterized by developmental delay and other neurological and muscular symptoms. The pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the brain damage in these patients are virtually unknown. However, they may be due to the neurotoxic actions of EMA. Therefore, in the present work we investigated whether chronic exposure of EMA during early development (from 5th to 28th day of life) could alter the behavioral performance of adult rats in the Morris water maze (MWM) and elevated plus maze tasks. Control rats were treated with saline in the same volumes. We observed that adult rats pretreated with EMA presented impairment in the learning and memory in water maze task spending significantly less time in the training quadrant. However, chronic EMA administration did not affect rat performance in the elevated plus maze tasks, suggesting that anxiety-like behavior was not changed by EMA. We also evaluated the in vitro effect of EMA on lipoperoxidation and on creatine kinase (CK) activity in rat hippocampus and observed that this metabolite induced lipid peroxidation and diminished creatine kinase activity. The results provide evidence that early chronic EMA treatment induces long-lasting spatial behavioral deficit that may be possibly related to a secondary bioenergetics dysfunction and/or increase of free radical production caused by this organic acid."
"It is widely accepted that brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a crucial role in mediating changes in learning and memory performance induced by environmental conditions. In order to ascertain whether BDNF modulates environmentally induced changes in exploratory behaviour, we examined mice carrying a deletion in one copy of the BDNF gene. Young heterozygous male BDNF knockout mice (BDNF+/-) and their wild-type (WT) controls were exposed to the enriched environment condition (EC) or the standard condition (SC) for 8 weeks. Exploratory behaviour was assessed in the open-field (OF) and hole-board (HB) test. Brains from EC and SC reared animals were processed for Golgi-Cox staining and the dendritic spine density in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1 hippocampal regions were examined. We found behavioural differences both due to the genetic modification and the environmental manipulation, with the BDNF+/- mice being more active in the OF whereas the EC mice had increased exploratory behaviour in the HB test. Environmental enrichment also led to an increase in dendritic spines in the hippocampal CA1 region and DG of the wild-type mice. This effect was also found in the enriched BDNF+/- mice, but was less pronounced. Our findings support the critical role of BDNF in behavioural and neural plasticity associated with environmental enrichment and suggest that besides maze learning performance, BDNF dependent mechanisms are also involved in other aspects of behaviour. Here we provide additional evidence that exploratory activity is influenced by BDNF."
"Administration of the synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2 has been shown to increase indices of noradrenergic activity. Neuroanatomical, neurochemical and behavioral studies have provided evidence supporting a marked impact of cannabinoids on the rat coeruleo-cortical pathway. As activity of this pathway is implicated in setting specific attentional modes, the present study assessed the influence of acute and repeated systemic administration of WIN 55,212-2 on novelty investigation in adolescent and adult male rats by using the hole board behavioral paradigm. Animals were individually acclimated to the hole board for 10-min sessions over 3 days, and novel objects were introduced on the fourth day. Novelty-seeking behavior was measured by comparison of the average number of return visits to a hole containing a novel object versus the average number of return visits to an empty hole. While attenuation of novelty preference was observed in adult rats acutely treated with WIN 55,212-2, both acutely treated adolescent groups retained their preference for novelty. All groups treated with repeated administration of either drug or vehicle demonstrated novelty preference, and no differences were found in the measure of novelty investigation between the groups. Furthermore, this study reproduced findings showing significant differences in locomotor activity that did not coincide with differences in novelty-seeking behavior. These data thus suggest a complex effect of CB1 receptor modulation on novelty preference in the male rat that is modulated by age and treatment."
"It is no secret that motor learning benefits from repetition. For example, pianists devote countless hours to performing complicated sequences of key presses, and golfers practice their swings thousands of times to reach a level of proficiency. Interestingly, the subsequent waking and sleeping hours after practice also play important roles in motor learning. During this time, a motor skill can consolidate into a more stable form that can lead to improved future performance without intervening practice. Though it is widely believed that sleep is crucial for this consolidation of motor learning, this is not generally true. In many instances only day-time consolidates motor learning, while in other instances neither day-time nor sleep consolidates learning. Recent studies have suggested that conscious awareness during motor training can determine whether sleep or day-time plays a role in consolidation. However, ongoing studies suggest that this explanation is also incomplete. In addition to conscious awareness, attention is an important factor to consider. This review discusses how attention and conscious awareness interact with day and night processes to consolidate a motor memory."
"Rats undergoing both naloxone-precipitated and spontaneous opioid withdrawal exhibit anxiogenic behaviors in the elevated plus maze (EPM). Recently, we observed an unexpected result, namely mice exhibited increased EPM open-arm time during naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal. This was surprising since this behavioral outcome is usually associated with an anxiolytic profile. This study demonstrates that mice exhibit an increase in both EPM open-arm time and % open-arm entries also during spontaneous opioid withdrawal."
"We have previously shown gonadal steroid-dependent, gender specific modulation of nociception by alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. Agonist activation of the receptor enhances its association with spinophilin that antagonizes arrestin functions both by diminishing receptor phosphorylation by G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) and by competing for receptor interactions with arrestin. Since spinophilin is highly enriched in dendritic spines, we investigated whether alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-induced antinociception as well as sex-related differences are modified in spinophilin knockout mice. We evaluated alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antinociception in a heat-evoked tail flick test in spinophilin wild type (Sp(+/+)) and knockout (Sp(-/-)) mice. Baseline tail flick latencies (TFLs) did not change between any groups. Interestingly, the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine, increased TFL in male and diestrous (low estrogen) Sp(-/-) as well as Sp(+/+) mice; in fact, this increase in TFL was significantly higher in Sp(-/-) male and diestrous groups than in their Sp(+/+) counterparts. This unexpected finding is consistent with enhanced alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated sedation observed previously in Sp(-/-) mice, presumably due to accelerated endocytosis of desensitized receptors and recycling of refreshed receptors when arrestin is not competed for by spinophilin in Sp(-/-) mice. Despite modulation of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor effects in Sp(-/-) mice, sex-related differences were retained; thus, clonidine was ineffective in proestrous females (highest estrogen levels), in both Sp(-/-) and Sp(+/+) mice, reaffirming that estrogen suppresses alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-evoked antinociception. These findings show that elimination of spinophilin enhances alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-evoked antinociception in estrogen-deprived physiological settings, suggesting a role for spinophilin to suppress these effects, and yet this enhanced response cannot overcome the absence of antinociception with elevated estrogen levels."
"We have previously reported that a genetically hypertensive strain of Wistar rat (GH), is deficient in nerve growth factor (NGF) and Trk receptors in dentate gyrus and that these deficits are accompanied by impaired expression of long-term potentiation (LTP) in perforant path-granule cell synapses. Here we confirm this deficit in LTP and report that this strain of rat also displays impairments in long-term recognition memory when compared with normotensive controls. Further analysis of neurotrophin expression in dentate gyrus confirmed the previously-reported deficit in NGF and revealed a decrease in expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but not neurotrophin 3 (NT3) or neurotrophin 4 (NT4), in GH rats. These alterations in ligand expression were accompanied by changes in Trk receptor expression; specifically, a decrease in expression of TrkA and TrkB, but not TrkC, in the dentate gyrus of GH, compared with normotensive, rats. We conclude that the impairments in LTP and learning and memory observed in the GH strain are associated with aberrant expression of specific neurotrophic factors and their receptors in the dentate gyrus, adding weight to the evidence indicating a role for these proteins in several forms of synaptic plasticity."
"In recent years the ventral pallidum has become a focus of great research interest as a mechanism of reward and incentive motivation. As a major output for limbic signals, the ventral pallidum was once associated primarily with motor functions rather than regarded as a reward structure in its own right. However, ample evidence now suggests that ventral pallidum function is a major mechanism of reward in the brain. We review data indicating that (1) an intact ventral pallidum is necessary for normal reward and motivation, (2) stimulated activation of ventral pallidum is sufficient to cause reward and motivation enhancements, and (3) activation patterns in ventral pallidum neurons specifically encode reward and motivation signals via phasic bursts of excitation to incentive and hedonic stimuli. We conclude that the ventral pallidum may serve as an important 'limbic final common pathway' for mesocorticolimbic processing of many rewards."
"Small-brained rodents have been the principle focus for pheromonal research and have provided comprehensive insights into the chemosensory mechanisms that underpin pheromonal communication and the hugely important roles that pheromones play in behavioural regulation. However, pheromonal communication does not start or end with the mouse and the rat, and work in amphibians reveals much about the likely evolutionary origins of the chemosensory systems that mediate pheromonal effects. The dual olfactory organs (the main olfactory epithelium and the vomeronasal organ), their receptors and their separate projection pathways appear to have ancient evolutionary origins, appearing in the aquatic ancestors of all tetrapods during the Devonian period and so pre-dating the transition to land. While the vomeronasal organ has long been considered an exclusively pheromonal organ, accumulating evidence indicates that it is not the sole channel for the transduction of pheromonal information and that both olfactory systems have been co-opted for the detection of different pheromone signals over the course of evolution. This has also led to great diversity in the vomeronasal and olfactory receptor families, with enormous levels of gene diversity and inactivation of genes in different species. Finally, the evolution of trichromacy as well as huge increases in social complexity have minimised the role of pheromones in the lives of primates, leading to the total inactivation of the vomeronasal system in catarrhine primates while the brain increased in size and behaviour became emancipated from hormonal regulation."
"This study shows that the BTBR T+tf/J mouse, a model for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), has increased levels of the stress hormone corticosterone, when compared to C57BL/6J mice. In addition, we have shown that tail suspension of the BTBR produces a heightened anxiety response in the elevated plus maze. These results suggest that the BTBR mouse is stressor-reactive exhibiting hormone responses that might predispose it to ASD."
"In a previous publication [Deacon RMJ, Cholerton LL, Talbot K, Nair-Roberts RG, Sanderson DJ, Romberg C, et al. Age-dependent and -independent behavioral deficits in Tg2576 mice. Behav Brain Res 2008;189:126-38] we found that very few cognitive tests were suitable for demonstrating deficits in Tg2576 mice, an amyloid over-expression model of Alzheimer's disease, even at 23 months of age. However, in a retrospective analysis of a separate project on these mice, tests of social memory and open field habituation revealed large cognitive impairments. Controls showed good open field habituation, but Tg2576 mice were hyperactive and failed to habituate. In the test of social memory for a juvenile mouse, controls showed considerably less social investigation on the second meeting, indicating memory of the juvenile, whereas Tg2576 mice did not show this decrement.As a control for olfactory sensitivity, on which social memory relies, the ability to find a food pellet hidden under wood chip bedding was assessed. Tg2576 mice found the pellet as quickly as controls. As this test requires digging ability, this was independently assessed in tests of burrowing and directly observed digging. In line with previous results and the hippocampal dysfunction characteristic of aged Tg2576 mice, they both burrowed and dug less than controls."
"In the present review we propose a model to explain the role of the basal ganglia in sensorimotor and cognitive functions based on a growing body of behavioural, anatomical, physiological, and neurochemical evidence accumulated over the last decades. This model proposes that the body and its surrounding environment are represented in the striatum in a fragmented and repeated way, like a mosaic consisting of the fragmented images of broken mirrors. Each fragment forms a functional unit representing articulated parts of the body with motion properties, objects of the environment which the subject can approach or manipulate, and locations the subject can move to. These units integrate the sensory properties and movements related to them. The repeated and widespread distribution of such units amplifies the combinatorial power of the associations among them. These associations depend on the phasic release of dopamine in the striatum triggered by the saliency of stimuli and will be reinforced by the rewarding consequences of the actions related to them. Dopamine permits synaptic plasticity in the corticostriatal synapses. The striatal units encoding the same stimulus/action send convergent projections to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) that stimulate or hold the action through a thalamus-frontal cortex pathway. According to this model, this is how the basal ganglia select actions based on environmental stimuli and store adaptive associations as nondeclarative memories such as motor skills, habits, and memories formed by Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning."
"In rodents, sexual advertisement and gender recognition are mostly (if not exclusively) mediated by chemosignals. Specifically, there is ample evidence indicating that female mice are 'innately' attracted by male sexual pheromones that have critical non-volatile components and are detected by the vomeronasal organ. These pheromones can only get access to the vomeronasal organ by active pumping mechanisms that require close contact with the source of the stimulus (e.g. urine marks) during chemoinvestigation. We have hypothesised that male sexual pheromones are rewarding to female mice. Indeed, male-soiled bedding can be used as a reinforcer to induce conditioned place preference, provided contact with the bedding is allowed. The neural mechanisms of pheromone reward seem, however, different from those employed by other natural reinforcers, such as the sweetness or postingestive effects of sucrose. In contrast to vomeronasal-detected male sexual pheromones, male-derived olfactory stimuli (volatiles) are not intrinsically attractive to female mice. However, after repeated exposure to male-soiled bedding, intact female mice develop an acquired preference for male odours. On the contrary, in females whose accessory olfactory bulbs have been lesioned, exposure to male-soiled bedding induces aversion to male odorants. These considerations, together with data on the different properties of olfactory and vomeronasal receptors, lead us to make a proposal for the complementary roles that the olfactory and vomeronasal systems play in intersexual attraction and in other forms of intra- or inter-species communication."
"We recently reported that orbitofrontal cortical (OFC) lesions impaired reversal learning of an instrumental two-lever spatial discrimination task, a deficit manifested as increased perseveration on the pre-potent response. Here we examine whether exposure to reversal learning test pre-operatively may have a beneficial effect for future reversal learning of OFC-lesioned animals. Rats were trained on a novel instrumental two-lever spatial discrimination and reversal learning task, measuring both 'cognitive flexibility' and constituent processes including response inhibition. Both levers were presented, only one of which was reinforced. The rat was required to respond on the reinforced lever under a fixed ratio 3 schedule of reinforcement. Following attainment of criterion, two reversals were introduced. Rats were then matched according to their reversal performance and subjected to bilateral excitotoxic OFC lesions. Following recovery, a series of four reversals was presented. OFC lesions impaired neither retention nor reversal phases. These data, together with the previously reported reversal deficit following OFC lesions, suggest that OFC is not needed when task experience has been gained but it is necessary when task demands are relatively high."
"The monoamine hypothesis of depression is increasingly called into question by newer theories that revolve around changes in neuronal plasticity, primarily in the hippocampus, at both the structural and the functional levels. Chronic stress negatively regulates hippocampal function while antidepressants ameliorate the effects of stress on neuronal morphology and activity. Both stress and antidepressants have been shown to affect levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) whose transcription is dependent on cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). BDNF itself has antidepressant-like actions and can induce transcription of a number of molecules. One class of genes regulated by both BDNF and serotonin (5-HT) are neuropeptides including VGF (non-acryonimic) which has a novel role in depression. Neuropeptides are important modulators of neuronal function but their role in affective disorders is just emerging. Recent studies demonstrate that VGF, which is also a CREB-dependent gene, is upregulated by antidepressant drugs and voluntary exercise and is reduced in animal models of depression. VGF enhances hippocampal synaptic plasticity as well as neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus but the mechanisms of antidepressant-like actions of VGF in behavioral paradigms are not known. We summarize experimental data describing the roles of BDNF, VGF and other neuropeptides in depression and how they may be acting through the generation of new neurons and altered synaptic activity. Understanding the molecular and cellular changes that underlie the actions of neuropeptides and how these adaptations result in antidepressant-like effects will aid in developing drugs that target novel pathways for major depressive disorders."
"The present study examined the effects of local injections of adrenaline (AD) or noradrenaline (NA) in equimolar doses (6, 20, and 60 nmol) into the median raphe nucleus (MRN) on ingestive and non-ingestive behaviors of free-feeding rats. The results showed that the treatment with AD at doses of 20 and 60 nmol increased food intake. While the hyperphagic response evoked by 60 nmol dose of AD was accompanied by a reduction of the latency to start feeding and an increase in the frequency of feeding, the 20 nmol dose of AD was unable to change these behavioral aspects of feeding response. The meal size and non-ingestive behaviors were not affected by AD treatment in the MRN. While water intake remained unchanged after the treatment with 20 nmol of AD in the MRN, this dose decreased the latency to start drinking. Feeding and drinking behaviors were not affected by treatment with NA in the MRN. These data suggest that adrenergic receptors of MRN participate in mechanisms that control food intake initiation or appetite. In addition, our results also indicate that the availability of energetic substrate could affect the adrenergic influence on MRN neurons since previous data indicated that the injection of AD into the MRN of food restricted rats decreased food intake."
"Repeated administration of drugs may induce adaptations which affect the behavioral responses to the drug itself or to other drugs. Whether individual characteristics to repeated drug administration predict sensitivity to the effects of another drug is not clear. We evaluated whether or not mice that present higher vs. lower locomotor response after repeated treatment with ethanol display increased or decreased locomotor responses when challenged with methamphetamine or morphine, and vice versa. Mice received daily i.p. 2.2 g/kg ethanol (21 days), 1.0 mg/kg methamphetamine or 10 mg/kg morphine (10 days). According to the response presented during repeated drug treatment, mice were classified as HIGH or LOW activity groups. Locomotor activity was monitored after mice were challenged with saline, and 48 h later with a drug. Ethanol-treated mice were challenged with methamphetamine or morphine, methamphetamine- and morphine-treated animals were challenged with ethanol. After repeated treatment with ethanol or methamphetamine, locomotor sensitization was observed only in HIGH mice, not LOW mice. Ethanol-treated mice with HIGH activity showed sensitized, increased locomotor responses to methamphetamine (p&lt;0.05), but not to morphine. Locomotor responses to ethanol were not affected by a previous history of methamphetamine treatment. Although repeated administration of morphine failed to induce sensitization, morphine-treated mice with HIGH activity presented sensitized locomotor responses after an ethanol challenge. The current experiments confirm important individual differences in response to repeated administration of ethanol, methamphetamine and morphine, which in some cases affected the locomotor response to a second drug challenge, in an asymmetrical pattern."
"The present study was carried out to elucidate the beneficial effect of pioglitazone in cognitive impairment induced by bilateral infusion of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) in rats, a model of Parkinson's disease. MPTP-lesioned rats showed poor cognitive performance in both passive avoidance task and cued version of the Morris water maze test. This deficit in learning and memory was found to be associated with oxidative stress. Chronic administration of pioglitazone (10 and 30 mg/kg, p.o., starting 5 days prior to MPTP administration and then for next 30 days) in MPTP-lesioned rats improved cognitive performance in passive avoidance task and cued version of the Morris water maze test. Furthermore, pioglitazone treatment also reduced oxidative stress (as evident by reduced malondialdehyde and increased glutathione levels). These results demonstrate the beneficial effects of pioglitazone on cognitive impairment in MPTP induced Parkinson's disease in rats."
"Dysbindin-1 (dystrobrevin binding protein-1) has been reported as a candidate gene associated with schizophrenia. Dysbindin-1 mRNA and protein levels are significantly reduced in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of schizophrenia subjects. To understand the in-vivo functions of dysbindin-1, we studied schizophrenia relevant behaviors in adult male Sandy homozygous (sdy/sdy) and heterozygous (sdy/+) mice that have a natural mutation in dysbindin-1 gene (on a DBA/2J background) resulting in loss of protein expression. Spontaneous locomotor activity of sdy/sdy and sdy/+ mice in novel environment was not significantly different from DBA/2J controls. However, on repeated testing in the same environment for 7 days, sdy/sdy mice, in contrast to DBA/2J controls showed a lack of locomotor habituation. Locomotor activating effect of a low dose of d-amphetamine (2.5 mg/kg i.p.), a behavioral measure of mesolimbic dopamine activity, was significantly reduced in the mutant mice. Interestingly, sdy/sdy mice showed enhanced locomotor sensitization to repeated five daily injection of amphetamine. Possible cognitive impairment in Sandy mutants was revealed in novel object recognition test as sdy/sdy and sdy/+ mice spent significantly less time exploring novel objects compared to DBA/2J. Sdy/sdy mice also showed deficits in emotionally motivated learning and memory showing greater freezing response to auditory conditioned stimulus (CS) in fear conditioning paradigm. In thermal nociceptive test, the latency of paw withdrawal in sdy/sdy and sdy/+ animals was significantly higher compared to DBA/2J indicating hypoalgesia in the mutants. Taken together, these data suggest that dysbindin-1 gene deficiency leads to significant changes in cognition and altered responses to psychostimulants."
"The present study was designed to determine the degree of functional dissociation between the rat perirhinal cortex and hippocampus for reference memory performance on object and place discrimination tasks. In one experiment, 30 rats were trained on a two-pair concurrent object discrimination task in an elevated radial arm maze. Rats with a perirhinal cortex lesion needed significantly more days to attain the criterion in the relearning of a pre-operatively acquired object discrimination task than the control rats and rats with a hippocampal lesion. However, there were no significant differences between the three groups in the days to attain the criterion in learning post-operatively the original object discrimination task with new discriminanda and its relearning. The rats with a hippocampal lesion did not show any impairment in object discrimination. In a second experiment, 27 rats were trained on a place discrimination task in the same maze. Rats with a hippocampal lesion required more days to attain the criterion than the control rats to relearn the pre-operatively acquired place discrimination task, and they had fewer correct responses in the first three sessions with new discriminanda than the control rats. Rats with a perirhinal cortex lesion, on the other hand, showed mild relearning impairment. These results suggest that there is a functionally single dissociation between the perirhinal cortex and hippocampus for reference memory performance on object and place discrimination tasks. They also suggest the possible involvement of the perirhinal cortex in spatial reference memory performance."
"Mechanisms underlying reward-related learning presumably involve neural plasticity integrating signals representing unconditioned and conditioned stimuli in regions mediating reward. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) receives such signals and shows synaptic plasticity which is NMDA receptor-dependent. To test the hypothesis that NMDA receptor stimulation in the VTA is necessary for the acquisition of food-reinforced appetitive learning, Long-Evans male rats were prepared with bilateral VTA cannulae and tested in operant chambers with the opportunity to lever press for food for 10 sessions. Animals received microinjections of AP-5 or vehicle immediately before sessions 1-4 and 10. AP-5 impaired acquisition of lever pressing during sessions 1-4 (but not when injected dorsal to the VTA). All groups increased lever pressing across sessions 5-9. On session 10, lever pressing was not affected regardless of treatment. In separate experiments, AP-5 failed to reduce free feeding, food reward or motor activity, suggesting that impairment in acquisition was not due to reduced food motivation or activity. NMDA transmission in the VTA thus appears to be necessary for the acquisition, but not expression, of reward-related learning."
"Inconsistent observations have been reported in the literature regarding the asymmetrical contribution of higher visual areas of the left and right hemispheres to visual motion processing. In the present experiment, we tested for hemispheric asymmetry of the middle-temporal complex (V5/MT), which is a key-component of the visual motion network, by using rTMS applied over left or right V5/MT during a visual trajectory perception task. The results showed that the effect of rTMS was to enhance individual hemispheric asymmetries present when the test was performed without rTMS. The more general meaning of these results is that there are robust individual hemispheric asymmetries in motion perception but no general pattern of hemispheric differences."
"The effects of abnormally high or low stress on learning are well established. The Barnes maze and Morris water maze are two commonly used tests of spatial memory, of which the water maze is considered more stressful; however, until now this has not been demonstrated empirically. In the present study, mice matched for performance on commonly used anxiety tasks were trained on either the Barnes maze or water maze or received no cognitive testing. Water-maze training induced greater increases in plasma corticosterone than did Barnes maze training, assessed 30 min after the final session. Importantly, spatial learning was inversely correlated with corticosterone levels in the water maze but not the Barnes maze, suggesting that performance on the water maze may be more affected by test-induced stress even within wild-type subjects of the same age and gender. These findings are important when considering the appropriate cognitive tasks for any experiment in which stress responses may differ systematically across groups."
"Spatial memory can be strengthened by adverse stimuli that activate the stress system, and administration of the stress hormone corticosterone in close-context with the learning task. Less is known about modulation of spatial memory by post-training positive reinforcers (reward). Cognitive performance was assessed in male C57BL/6J mice using two learning tasks: the water maze (WM) and circular hole board (CHB). Sugar was chosen as a post-training reinforcer. We expected that the free access to sugar immediately (0 h) after training would facilitate spatial memory; delayed access to sugar (4h after training) or no sugar served as controls. In both tasks, 0 h sugar mice showed superior performance, indicated by shorter latencies and distances to the trained spatial location. The memory facilitating effect of sugar became visible at distinct times during training: on the CHB from the first trial onwards, in the WM on training days 4 and 5. Sugar-rewarded mice kept their superior performance during the free exploration/swim trial, expressed by more persistent search strategies for the exit hole or platform. Post-training sugar reward in close-context with performance strengthens memory via modulation of consolidation. This finding supports the integrative theory of reinforcement and memory. We suggest that our experimental set-up will allow to differentiate between direct effects on memory and alterations in reward processes in animal models of stress-related diseases."
"In a prior study, phasic release of dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) was only transiently and rarely detected by means of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FCSV) in rats already trained to work for electrical stimulation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) on a continuous reinforcement schedule. However, in rats receiving rewarding electrical stimulation via lateral hypothalamic (LH) electrodes, elevated DA tone in the NAc terminal field was detected via microdialysis for up to 2h, even when short (1.5s) inter-train intervals were employed. To better characterize the similarities and differences between the FSCV and microdialysis measurements, we trained rats to self-administer VTA stimulation under conditions similar to those employed in the initial FSCV study. The results resemble those obtained by means of microdialysis in rats receiving LH stimulation but differed from the prior FSCV data. Although the concentration of DA in dialysate obtained from NAc probes did fall after having peaked at the 30 min mark, this decline set in much later than in the FSCV studies, and elevated DA tone could still be detected after 110 min of self-stimulation. The stimulation-induced peak in DA tone could be restored by a 30 min rest period, a manipulation that was ineffective previously in restoring the FSCV measure of phasic release. These findings are discussed in terms of the differential sensitivity of the FSCV and microdialysis methods to phasic and tonic signaling by DA neurons and to different transitions between their activity states."
