Abstract
"It has been proposed that tinnitus is associated with an irregular activation of the temporoparietal cortex. If this activity is a functionally relevant component of the tinnitus-related network, a virtual temporary lesion of this area should result in transient reduction of tinnitus. To test this hypothesis, we applied 10Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to eight scalp and four control positions in 14 patients with chronic tinnitus. Stimulation of left temporoparietal cortex significantly reduced tinnitus (Friedman analysis of variance, p &lt; 0.05; compared with control), indicating that secondary auditory areas can be critical for tinnitus perception, perhaps as a consequence of maladaptive cortical reorganization."
"Interictal potentials are commonly observed between seizures in human epilepsies and in animal models of epilepsy. It is uncertain whether interictal spiking in partial epilepsies is causally related with the onset of an ictal discharge. To analyze the reciprocal correlation between interictal and ictal epileptiform events, we performed extracellular recordings in the limbic system of the in vitro isolated guinea pig brain preparation. Arterial perfusion of bicuculline (50 microM) in vitro consistently induced a focal ictal discharge in the hippocampal-entorhinal region that in one third of the experiments was associated with periodic interictal spikes in the piriform cortex. In the absence of active interictal spiking, the piriform cortex was secondarily invaded by the ictal discharge initiated in the hippocampal-entorhinal region, whereas no secondary ictal entrainment was observed in the presence of periodic piriform cortex spikes at circa 0.1 to 0.2 Hz. Similarly, ictal events never occurred when arterial perfusion of bicuculline was preceded by a local injection of the same drug in the piriform cortex, a procedure that induces a sustained interictal spiking. A reduced responsiveness to incoming paroxysmal discharges generated in the hippocampus was observed during the interval between two interictal spikes in the piriform cortex."
"Spinal cord injury causes secondary biochemical changes leading to neuronal cell death. To clarify the molecular basis of this delayed injury, we subjected rats to spinal cord injury and identified gene expression patterns by high-density oligonucleotide arrays (8,800 genes studied) at 30 minutes, 4 hours, 24 hours, or 7 days after injury (total of 26 U34A profiles). Detailed analyses were limited to 4,300 genes consistently expressed above background. Temporal clustering showed rapid expression of immediate early genes (30 minutes), followed by genes associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and cell cycle (4 and 24 hours). Functional clustering showed a novel pattern of cell cycle mRNAs at 4 and 24 hours after trauma. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction verified mRNA changes in this group, which included gadd45a, c-myc, cyclin D1 and cdk4, pcna, cyclin G, Rb, and E2F5. Changes in their protein products were quantified by Western blot, and cell-specific expression was determined by immunocytochemistry. Cell cycle proteins showed an increased expression 24 hours after injury and were, in part, colocalized in neurons showing morphological evidence of apoptosis. These findings suggest that cell cycle-related genes, induced after spinal cord injury, are involved in neuronal damage and subsequent cell death."
"The development of resistance to pharmacological treatment is common to many human diseases. In chronic epilepsy, many patients develop resistance to anticonvulsant drug treatment during the course of their disease, with the underlying mechanisms remaining unclear. We have studied cellular mechanisms underlying drug resistance in resected hippocampal tissue from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy by comparing two groups of patients, the first displaying a clinical response to the anticonvulsant carbamazepine and a second group with therapy-resistant seizures. Using patch-clamp recordings, we show that the mechanism of action of carbamazepine, use-dependent block of voltage-dependent Na(+) channels, is completely lost in carbamazepine-resistant patients. Likewise, seizure activity elicited in human hippocampal slices is insensitive to carbamazepine. In marked contrast, carbamazepine-induced use-dependent block of Na(+) channels and blocked seizure activity in vitro in patients clinically responsive to this drug. Consistent with these results in human patients, we also show that use-dependent block of Na(+) channels by carbamazepine is absent in chronic experimental epilepsy. Taken together, these data suggest that a loss of Na(+) channel drug sensitivity may constitute a novel mechanism underlying the development of drug-resistant epilepsy."
"Dystonia is a neurological syndrome involving sustained contractions of opposing muscles leading to abnormal movements and postures. Recent studies report abnormally low pallidal neuronal activity in patients with generalized dystonia, suggesting hyperkinetic disorders result from underactive basal ganglia output. We examined this hypothesis in 11 patients with segmental and generalized dystonia undergoing microelectrode exploration of the internal globus pallidus (GPi) before pallidotomy or deep brain stimulation (DBS) implantation. The mean firing rates and firing patterns were compared with those in six patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In seven patients who underwent surgery under local anesthesia, the mean GPi firing rate was 77 Hz, similar to the 74 Hz observed in the PD patients. However, in three dystonic patients under propofol anesthesia, GPi mean firing rate was much reduced (31 Hz), and the firing pattern was distinguished by long pauses in activity, as reported by others. Low-dose propofol in one other dystonia patient also seemed to suppress GPi firing. These results indicate that an abnormally low basal ganglia output is not the sine qua non of dystonia. The widely accepted pathophysiological models of dystonia that propose global decreases in basal ganglia output need to be viewed with caution in light of these findings."
"There is increasing evidence of a potential role of the dopaminergic system in orthostatic tremor (OT): Association with parkinsonism and treatment effects of L-dopa and dopamine agonists have been reported. Eleven patients with isolated OT had single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using (123)I-FP-CIT ([(123)I]-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(-4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane) as dopamine transporter tracer. Results were compared with 12 age-matched normal controls and 12 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). A marked reduction in striatal tracer binding was found in OT compared to normal controls (p &lt; 0.001). Tracer uptake was significantly higher and more symmetrical than in PD, and caudate and putamen were equally affected. L-dopa challenges, performed in seven patients, showed a small but non-significant improvement on EMG and a small but significant improvement in clinical parameters on blinded video rating. Two-month open-label L-dopa treatment (600 mg/day) led to a small improvement in two of five patients but no significant overall change. Olfactory function on University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test was normal. Our finding of a marked tracer uptake reduction on dopamine transporter SPECT supports a role of the dopaminergic system in OT. Lack of evidence of a clinically relevant therapeutic response to L-dopa suggests that other mechanisms must also be involved in the pathogenesis."
"The known neuroprotective effects of minocycline and creatine in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) led us to examine whether the combination of these agents would result in increased neuroprotection. As previously reported, we confirmed in ALS mice that either minocycline or creatine treatment results in improvement in motor performance and extended survival. We report that combination of minocycline and creatine resulted in additive neuroprotection, suggesting this to be a novel potential strategy for the treatment of ALS. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating additive neuroprotection of a combinatorial approach in a mouse model of ALS. Adding relevancy to our findings, minocycline and creatine, are relatively safe, cross the blood-brain barrier, and are currently available for human evaluation."
"Oculobulbar symptoms and/or signs were present in 18 of 23 (78%) of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) patients evaluated at the Lahey Clinic (Table). Sixty-five percent (15 of 23) of our patients had ptosis and/or diplopia, each present in 11 individuals. Bulbar signs and symptoms, including dysarthria in 10 and dysphagia in 8 patients, also were observed among our LEMS population. More than one prereferral oculobulbar feature occurred in 13 of our LEMS patients. Prereferral diagnostic considerations included myasthenia gravis, myopathies, and psychiatric disorders. These findings suggest that these atypical characteristics served to dissuade some colleagues from a diagnosis of LEMS. Thus, the presence of oculobulbar symptoms and signs cannot be used to exclude LEMS from the differential diagnosis."
"We report a case of neonatal congenital lactic acidosis associated with pyruvate dehydrogenase E3-binding protein deficiency in a newborn girl. She had a severe encephalopathy, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed large subependymal cysts and no basal ganglia lesions. She died 35 days after birth. We detected a novel homozygous deletion (620delC) in the PDX1 gene, which encodes for the E3BP subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex."
"There is considerable evidence suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage may play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). This possibility has been strengthened by recent studies in animal models, which have shown that a selective inhibitor of complex I of the electron transport gene can produce an animal model that closely mimics both the biochemical and histopathological findings of PD. Several agents are available that can modulate cellular energy metabolism and that may exert antioxidative effects. There is substantial evidence that mitochondria are a major source of free radicals within the cell. These appear to be produced at both the iron-sulfur clusters of complex I as well as the ubiquinone site. Agents that have shown to be beneficial in animal models of PD include creatine, coenzyme Q(10), Ginkgo biloba, nicotinamide, and acetyl-L-carnitine. Creatine has been shown to be effective in several animal models of neurodegenerative diseases and currently is being evaluated in early stage trials in PD. Similarly, coenzyme Q(10) is also effective in animal models and has shown promising effects both in clinical trials of PD as well as in clinical trials in Huntington's disease and Friedreich's ataxia. Many other agents show good human tolerability. These agents therefore are promising candidates for further study as neuroprotective agents in PD."
"In this review, the potential role of positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography as biological markers for following the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) is discussed, and their value for assessing the efficacy of putative neuroprotective agents in PD is considered. It is concluded that functional imaging provides a valuable adjunct to clinical assessment when judging the efficacy of neuroprotective approaches to PD."
"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. To date, its cause remains unknown and the mechanism of nerve cell death uncertain. Apart from the massive loss of dopaminergic neurons, PD brains also show a conspicuous glial reaction together with signs of a neuroinflammatory reaction manifested by elevated cytokine levels and upregulation of inflammatory-associated factors such as cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Mounting evidence also suggests a possible deleterious effect of these neuroinflammatory processes in experimental models of the disease. We propose that, in PD, neuroinflammation plays a role in the cascade of events leading to nerve cell death, thus propagating the neurodegenerative process. In this review, we summarize and discuss the latest findings regarding neuroinflammatory aspects in PD."
"New therapeutic nonpharmacological methodology in Parkinson's disease (PD) involves cell and synaptic renewal or replacement to restore function of neuronal systems, including the dopaminergic (DA) system. Using fetal DA cell therapy in PD patients and laboratory models, it has been demonstrated that functional motor deficits associated with parkinsonism can be reduced. Similar results have been observed in animal models with stem cell-derived DA neurons. Evidence obtained from transplanted PD patients further shows that the underlying disease process does not destroy transplanted fetal DA cells, although degeneration of the host nigrostriatal system continues. The optimal DA cell regeneration system would reconstitute a normal neuronal network capable of restoring feedback-controlled release of DA in the nigrostriatal system. The success of cell therapy for PD is limited by access to preparation and development of highly specialized dopaminergic neurons found in the A9 and A10 region of the substantia nigra pars compacta as well as the technical and surgical steps associated with the transplantation procedure. Recent laboratory work has focused on using stem cells as a starting point for deriving the optimal DA cells to restore the nigrostriatal system. Ultimately, understanding the cell biological principles necessary for generating functional DA neurons can provide many new avenues for better treatment of patients with PD."
"Oxidative stress contributes to the cascade leading to dopamine cell degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, oxidative stress is intimately linked to other components of the degenerative process, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, nitric oxide toxicity and inflammation. It is therefore difficult to determine whether oxidative stress leads to, or is a consequence of, these events. Oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA occurs in PD, and toxic products of oxidative damage, such as 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), can react with proteins to impair cell viability. There is convincing evidence for the involvement of nitric oxide that reacts with superoxide to produce peroxynitrite and ultimately hydroxyl radical production. Recently, altered ubiquitination and degradation of proteins have been implicated as key to dopaminergic cell death in PD. Oxidative stress can impair these processes directly, and products of oxidative damage, such as HNE, can damage the 26S proteasome. Furthermore, impairment of proteasomal function leads to free radical generation and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs in idiopathic PD and products of oxidative damage interfere with cellular function, but these form only part of a cascade, and it is not possible to separate them from other events involved in dopaminergic cell death."
"A major goal of the neuroscience community is to develop neuroprotective treatment strategies that will slow or forestall the progression of Parkinson's disease, one of the most common adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders, affecting approximately 1 million people in North America. Although prior research to identify neuroprotective interventions has not been conclusive, recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, including the development of relevant animal models, provide the opportunity for rational clinical trials to assess neuroprotective treatments."
"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects approximately 1,000,000 Americans. The cause of the disease remains unknown. The histopathological hallmarks of the disease are dopaminergic striatal insufficiency secondary to a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and intracellular inclusion called Lewy bodies. Currently, only symptomatic treatment for PD is available. Although some treatments are efficacious for many years, all have significant limitations and new therapeutic approaches are needed. Gene therapy is ideal for delivering therapeutic molecules to site-specific regions of the central nervous system. Via gene therapy, a piece or pieces of DNA placed into a carrying vector encoding for a substance of interest can be introduced into specific cells. Although there are several ways that gene therapy can be applied for PD, this review focuses on in vivo gene delivery of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) as a neuroprotective strategy for PD."
"Despite being the subject of intense study, the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease still remains unclear. In recent years, however, there has been increasing evidence to support a role for genetic factors in its cause. This has come from twin and family studies, the mapping and cloning of PARK genes that are associated with the development of PD, and analysis of potential susceptibility genes. There is also evidence indicating that environmental factors may play a role in the disease process. It is likely that for most cases, there is a complex interplay between these genetic and environmental influences in the causation of Parkinson's disease. This article reviews the evidence in support of genetic and environmental factors in the cause of PD."
"Prolonged early-life seizures are considered potential risk factors for later epilepsy development, but mediators of this process remain largely unknown. Seizure-induced structural damage in hippocampus, including cell loss and mossy fiber sprouting, is thought to contribute to the hyperexcitability characterizing epilepsy, but a causative role has not been established. To determine whether early-life insults that lead to epilepsy result in similar structural changes, we subjected rat pups to lithium-pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus during postnatal development (day 20) and examined them as adults for the occurrence of spontaneous seizures and alterations in hippocampal morphology. Sixty-seven percent of rats developed spontaneous seizures after status epilepticus, yet only one third of these epileptic animals exhibited visible hippocampal cell loss or mossy fiber sprouting in dentate gyrus. Most epileptic rats had no apparent structural alterations in the hippocampus detectable using standard light microscopy methods (profile counts and Timm's staining). These results suggest that hippocampal cell loss and mossy fiber sprouting can occur after early-life status epilepticus but may not be necessary prerequisites for epileptogenesis in the developing brain."
"Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), Walker-Warburg syndrome, and muscle-eye-brain disease are clinically similar autosomal recessive disorders characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy, cobblestone lissencephaly, and eye anomalies. FCMD is frequent in Japan, but no FCMD patient with confirmed fukutin gene mutations has been identified in a non-Japanese population. Here, we describe a Turkish CMD patient with severe brain and eye anomalies. Sequence analysis of the patient's DNA identified a homozygous 1bp insertion mutation in exon 5 of the fukutin gene. To our knowledge, this is the first case worldwide in which a fukutin mutation has been found outside the Japanese population. This report emphasizes the importance of considering fukutin mutations for diagnostic purposes outside of Japan."
"Autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. Some patients exhibit mutations in the leucine-rich glioma inactivated (LGI1) gene. In an ADPEAF family, a novel mutation in the Lgi1 signal peptide is predicted to interfere with the protein cell sorting, resulting in altered processing. This finding suggests a loss-of-function mechanism for LGI1 gene mutations causing ADPEAF even if other mechanisms cannot be ruled out."
"Myophosphorylase deficiency is characterized by exercise intolerance, muscle cramps, and recurrent myoglobinuria. Some patients are severely affected, whereas others are minimally affected or asymptomatic. The molecular basis of the disease has been elucidated but does not provide an explanation for the clinical variability. In a large cohort of patients with myophosphorylase deficiency, we tested the hypothesis that polymorphic variants in either myoadenylate deaminase (MADA) or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) could act as modulators of phenotype expression. Forty-seven patients were evaluated. Clinical severity was assessed according to a severity scale of four grades. MADA activity was studied by histochemical and biochemical analysis of muscle, and the Q12X mutation in the adenine monophosphate deaminase 1 gene (AMPD1) and the insertion/deletion polymorphism in the ACE gene were assessed genetically. A complete MADA defect together with the Q12X mutation was detected in one severely affected patient. Eleven patients were heterozygous for the Q12X mutation. There was no association between clinical grading and MADA status. In contrast, we found a highly significant (p &lt; 0.01) association between ACE genotype and clinical severity, with strong correlation between severe phenotype and number of D alleles. We show that ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism may play a significant role as phenotype modulator in McArdle's disease."
"There is currently no effective pharmacological treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Because evidence suggests that multiple pathways may contribute to ALS pathogenesis, we tested in a mouse model of ALS (SOD1(G37R) mice) a combination approach consisting of three drugs for distinct targets in the complex pathway to neuronal death: minocycline, an antimicrobial agent that inhibits microglial activation, riluzole, a glutamate antagonist, and nimodipine, a voltage-gated calcium channel blocker. The efficacy of this three-drug cocktail was remarkable when administered in the diet from late presymptomatic stage (8-9 months). It delayed the onset of disease, slowed the loss of muscle strength, and increased the average longevity of SOD1(G37R) mice by 6 weeks. The protective effect of the treatment was corroborated by the reduced immunodetection signals for markers of gliosis and neurodegeneration in the spinal cord of SOD1(G37R) mice. These results indicate that such three-drug combination may represent an effective strategy for ALS treatment."
"Heterozygous missense mutations in the caveolin-3 gene (CAV3) cause different muscle disorders. Most patients with CAV3 alterations present with rippling muscle disease (RMD) characterized by signs of increased muscle irritability without muscle weakness. In some patients, CAV3 mutations underlie the progressive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1C (LGMD1C). Here, we report two unrelated patients with novel homozygous mutations (L86P and A92T) in CAV3. Both presented with a more severe clinical phenotype than usually seen in RMD. Immunohistochemical and immunoblot analyses of muscle biopsies showed a strong reduction of caveolin-3 in both homozygous RMD patients similar to the findings in heterozygous RMD. Electron microscopy studies showed a nearly complete absence of caveolae in the sarcolemma in all RMD patients analyzed. Additional plasma membrane irregularities (small plasmalemmal discontinuities, subsarcolemmal vacuoles, abnormal papillary projections) were more pronounced in homozygous than in heterozygous RMD patients. A stronger activation of nitric oxide synthase was observed in both homozygous patients compared with heterozygous RMD. Like in LGMD1C, dysferlin immunoreactivity is reduced in RMD but more pronounced in homozygous as compared with heterozygous RMD. Thus, we further extend the phenotypic variability of muscle caveolinopathies by identification of a severe form of RMD associated with homozygous CAV3 mutations."
"The human brain is expert in analyzing rapidly and precisely facial features, especially emotional expressions representing a powerful communication vector. The involvement of insula in disgust recognition has been reported in behavioral and functional imaging studies. However, we do not know whether specific insular fields are involved in disgust processing nor what the processing time course is. Using depth electrodes implanted during presurgical evaluation of patients with drug-refractory temporal lobe epilepsy, we recorded intracerebral event-related potentials to human facial emotional expressions, that is, fear, disgust, happiness, surprise, and neutral expression. We studied evoked responses in 13 patients with insular contacts to specify the insular fields involved in disgust processing and assess the timing of their activation. We showed that specific potentials to disgust beginning 300 milliseconds after stimulus onset and lasting 200 milliseconds were evoked in the ventral anterior insula in four patients. The occurrence and latency of event-related potentials to disgust in the ventral anterior insula were affected by selective attention. The analysis of spatial and temporal characteristics of insular responses to disgust facial expression lead us to underline the crucial role of ventral anterior insula in the categorization of facial emotional expressions, particularly the disgust."
"Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome (GBS) is an immune-mediated neuropathy, in which leukocytes and humoral components of the immune system proposedly initiate localized inflammation. An important pathogenic role for anti-GM1 ganglioside antibodies has been suggested. Therefore, we evaluated anti-GM1 IgG antibody-induced leukocyte effector functions such as degranulation and phagocytosis using serum of 24 GBS patients. Serum without anti-GM1 antibodies of 9 GBS patients as well as pooled serum from healthy individuals served as controls. Ten out of 15 (67%) of anti-GM1 IgG positive sera were capable of inducing leukocyte degranulation, and 8 out of 15 (53%) of anti-GM1 IgG positive sera were capable of inducing phagocytosis of GM1-coated beads. In all of these sera anti-GM1 antibody titers were &gt;or=1:800. No leukocyte degranulation or phagocytosis was observed in control sera. Leukocyte activation was completely abrogated in the presence of IgG receptor (FcgammaR) blocking antibodies, suggesting a crucial role for leukocyte FcgammaR in GBS pathogenesis. No correlation of antibody titers with the extent of leukocyte activation, or severity of disease was observed. These data document the capacity of anti-GM1 IgG antibodies to activate leukocyte inflammatory functions, and suggest an important role for anti-ganglioside IgG antibodies in the pathogenesis of GBS."
"Electroencephalographic studies have demonstrated smaller auditory responses to infrequent deviances of speech and nonspeech sounds in dyslexic than normal-reading subjects. We used a whole-scalp neuromagnetometer to study selectively reactivity of the auditory cortices to sound deviances in 8 dyslexic and 11 normal-reading adults. Within a monotonous sequence of 50-millisecond 1000 Hz binaural tones, tones of 920 and 1080 Hz occurred with 7% probability each. Magnetic mismatch fields, elicited by the stimulus deviances, were diminished in the left hemisphere of the dyslexic subjects. The results indicate deficient change detection in the left auditory cortex of right-handed dyslexic adults."
"Mutations of the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 gene (GDAP1) cause autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4A. We report four additional families with recessive mutations (487C--&gt;T, Q163X; 359G--&gt;A, R120Q) of GDAP1; Q163X occurred in three unrelated Hispanic families that had the same haplotype suggesting a Spanish founder mutation. Both the Q163X and the R120Q mutation cause demyelination and axonal loss. The patients had symptoms within the first two years of life and involvement of cranial, sensory, and enteric nerves. Neuropathology showed loss of large myelinated fibers, onion bulb formations and focal folding of the outer myelin lamina."
"Neurogenesis persists in the adult brain, where it may contribute to repair and recovery after injury, but the lack of methods for noninvasive stimulation of cerebral neurogenesis limits its potential for clinical application. We report that intranasal administration of either fibroblast growth factor-2 or heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor increases neurogenesis, measured by the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine into cells that express the early neuronal marker protein doublecortin in the subventricular zone of mouse brain. These findings indicate that intranasal growth factors may have potential as neurogenesis-promoting therapeutic agents."
"We analyzed the PRNP M129V polymorphism in a Dutch population-based early-onset Alzheimer's disease sample. We observed a significant association between early-onset Alzheimer's disease and homozygosity of M129V (odds ratio [OR], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.3; p = 0.02) with the highest risk for V homozygotes (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.4-7.1; p &lt; 0.01). In patients with a positive family history, these risks increased to 2.6 (95% CI, 1.3-5.3; p &lt; 0.01) and 3.5 (95% CI, 1.3-9.3; p = 0.01), respectively."
"The reduced progesterone metabolite tetrahydroprogesterone is a potent positive modulator of GABA(A) chloride conductance that exerts powerful neuroinhibitiory and anti-seizure effects in animal models. Cyclic natural progesterone use may lessen seizure frequency in women with catamenial seizure exacerbation. We report a case in which efficacy was eliminated during concomitant treatment with a reductase inhibitor. The observation suggests that a reduced metabolite, rather than progesterone itself, was responsible for improved seizure control."
Twelve patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy and unilateral hippocampal sclerosis had repeat volumetric magnetic resonance imaging scans after a mean of 3.4 years to determine whether progressive hippocampal volume loss occurred. Seizure-free patients showed no change in hippocampal volume. Patients with continuing seizures had a decline in ipsilateral hippocampal volume that correlated with seizure frequency. Patients with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy and unilateral hippocampal sclerosis have progressive hippocampal atrophy.
"The etiopathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been elusive. Recently, several lines of evidence have converged to suggest that defects in the ubiquitin-proteasome system and proteolytic stress underlie nigral pathology in both familial and sporadic forms of the illness. In support of this concept, mutations in alpha-synuclein that cause the protein to misfold and resist proteasomal degradation cause familial PD. Similarly, mutations in two enzymes involved in the normal function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, parkin and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1, are also associated with hereditary PD. Furthermore, structural and function defects in 26/20S proteasomes with accumulation and aggregation of potentially cytotoxic abnormal proteins have been identified in the substantia nigra pars compacta of patients with sporadic PD. Thus, a defect in protein handling appears to be a common factor in sporadic and the various familial forms of PD. This hypothesis may also account for the vulnerability of the substantia nigra pars compacta in PD, why the disorder is age related, and the nature of the Lewy body. It has also facilitated the development of experimental models that recapitulate the behavioral and pathological features of PD, and hopefully will lead to the development of novel neuroprotective therapies for the disorder."
"Levodopa and other dopaminergic medications drastically improve the motor symptoms and quality of life of patients with Parkinson's disease in the early stages of the disease. However, once the ""honeymoon"" period has waned, usually after a few years of dopaminergic therapy, patients become progressively more disabled despite an ever more complex combination of available antiparkinsonian treatments. Sooner or later, they suffer from ""dopa-resistant"" motor symptoms (speech impairment, abnormal posture, gait and balance problems), ""dopa-resistant"" nonmotor signs (autonomic dysfunction, mood and cognitive impairment, sleep problems, pain) and/or drug-related side effects (especially psychosis, motor fluctuations, and dyskinesias). Therefore, the current antiparkinsonian therapy cannot be considered as ideal with regard to both efficacy and safety."
"Thirty-six patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) were randomized to either medical therapy (N = 18) or unilateral GPi pallidotomy (N = 18). The primary outcome variable was the change in total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score at 6 months. Secondary outcome variables included subscores and individual parkinsonian symptoms as determined from the UPDRS. At the six month follow-up, patients receiving pallidotomy had a statistically significant reduction (32% decrease) in the total UPDRS score compared to those randomized to medical therapy (5% increase). Following surgery, patients' showed improvement in all the cardinal motor signs of PD including tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, gait and balance. Drug-induced dyskinesias were also markedly improved. Although the greatest improvement occurred on the side contralateral to the lesion, significant ipsilateral improvement was also observed for bradykinesia, rigidity and drug-induced dyskinesias. A total of twenty patients have been followed for 2 years to assess the effect of time on clinical outcome. These patients have shown sustained improvement in the total UPDRS (p &lt; 0.0001), ""off"" motor (p &lt; 0.0001) and complications of therapy subscores (p &lt; 0.0001). Sustained improvement was also seen for tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, percent on time and drug-induced dyskinesias."
"We identified the IgG autoantibody ANNA-2 (""anti-Ri"") in 34 patients in a 12-year period by immunofluorescence screening of sera from approximately 75000 patients with subacute neurological disorders that were suspected to be paraneoplastic. Detailed clinical information was available for 28 patients (10 men, 18 women). Cancer was diagnosed in 24 patients (86%); 21 had histologically proven carcinoma (10 lung, 9 breast, 1 cervical, 1 bladder), and 3 had an intrathoracic imaging abnormality. Cancer anteceded neurological symptoms in 4 of 28 patients. Cancer detection frequency increased with continued surveillance. Neurological disorders, in decreasing frequency, were brainstem syndrome (including opsoclonus, myoclonus, or both), cerebellar syndrome, myelopathy, peripheral neuropathy, cranial neuropathy, movement disorder, encephalopathy, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, and seizures. Four patients had laryngospasm and four had jaw opening dystonia (two with neck dystonia). Nine (32%) were wheelchair-bound 1 month after neurological symptom onset. Most improved neurologically after immunomodulatory or tumor-directed therapy. Accompanying autoantibodies, found in 73% of sera, included ANNA-1, ANNA-3, CRMP-5-IgG, P/Q-type and N-type Ca(2+) channel antibodies, and muscle-type acetylcholine receptor antibody. Some neurological accompaniments of ANNA-2 may reflect potentially pathogenic humoral or cell-mediated responses to coimmunogenic tumor antigens, for example, Lambert-Eaton syndrome (P/Q-type Ca(2+) channel antibody) and peripheral neuropathy (ANNA-1 effector T cells)."
"Glutamate excitotoxicity is implicated in the progressive loss of oligodendrocytes in multiple sclerosis, but how glutamate metabolism is dysregulated in the disease remains unclear. Because there is microglia activation in all stages of multiple sclerosis, we determined whether a microglia product, interleukin-1beta, could provide the mechanism for glutamate excitotoxicity. We found that whereas interleukin-1beta did not kill oligodendrocytes in pure culture, it produced apoptosis of oligodendrocytes in coculture with astrocytes and microglia. This requirement for a mixed glia environment suggests that interleukin-1beta impairs the well-described glutamate-buffering capacity of astrocytes. In support, antagonists at AMPA/kainate glutamate receptors, NBQX and CNQX, blocked the interleukin-1beta toxicity to oligodendrocytes. Another microglia/macrophage cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, also evoked apoptosis of oligodendrocytes in a mixed glia environment in an NBQX-blockable manner. These results provide a mechanistic link between the persistent and insidious microglia activation that is evident in all stages of multiple sclerosis, with the recent appreciation that glutamate excitotoxicity leads to the destruction of oligodendrocytes in the disease."
"Polymicrogyria is a common malformation of cortical development characterized by an excessive number of small gyri and abnormal cortical lamination. Multiple syndromes of region-specific bilateral symmetric polymicrogyria have been reported. We previously have described two families with bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP), an autosomal recessive syndrome that we mapped to a locus on chromosome 16q12-21. Here, we extend our observations to include 19 patients from 10 kindreds, all linked to the chromosome 16q locus, allowing us to define the clinical and radiological features of BFPP in detail. The syndrome is characterized by global developmental delay of at least moderate severity, seizures, dysconjugate gaze, and bilateral pyramidal and cerebellar signs. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated symmetric polymicrogyria affecting the frontoparietal regions most severely, as well as ventriculomegaly, bilateral white matter signal changes, and small brainstem and cerebellar structures. We have refined our genetic mapping and describe two apparent founder haplotypes, one of which is present in two families with BFPP and associated microcephaly. Because 11 of our patients initially were classified as having other malformations, the syndrome of BFPP appears to be more common than previously recognized and may be frequently misdiagnosed."
"We determined whether higher endogenous estradiol levels were associated with lower risk of dementia in older men and women not using hormonal replacement therapy, using a case-cohort design within the Rotterdam Study, a population-based follow-up study on chronic diseases, including dementia, in 7983 subjects aged 55 years or older, and ongoing since 1990. The analyses were based on a random subcohort of 508 women and 438 men, and on 76 women and 53 men with incident dementia. Cox proportional hazards models with robustly estimated standard errors showed that in women higher levels of total estradiol were associated with higher risk of dementia (age-adjusted hazard ratio per standard deviation increase 1.38; 95% CI 1.04-1.84). Age-adjusted HR's of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia associated with higher levels of total estradiol (per SD increase) were 1.24 (95% CI 0.87-1.76) and 2.19 (95% CI 1.22-3.92), respectively. Similar results were observed for bioavailable estradiol. Additional adjustments for potential confounders did not change the results substantially. In men, no clear association was observed between estradiol levels and risk of dementia or its subtypes. The findings do not support the hypothesis that higher levels of endogenous estradiol reduce risk of dementia, neither in women nor in men."
"Fragile X premutation carriers do not have typical fragile X syndrome (FXS) although late-onset progressive action tremor and gait disorder with CNS atrophy was recently reported in male carriers. We compared tremor, gait disorder and parkinsonian signs in FXS premutation subjects (age 50 or more) and a similar control population, using a standardized videotaping protocol. Videotapes were rated using standard scales for tremor (CRST), ataxia (ICARS), and parkinsonian signs (UPDRS) by an investigator blinded to premutation status. Compared to all other groups pooled (n = 30), the male premutation carrier group (n = 7) had significantly higher scores on the CRST (p = 0.0008), ICARS (p = 0.001), and UPDRS (p = 0.0094). On the CRST, rest, postural and kinetic tremor scores were all higher in the male carriers. The elevated total UPDRS and ICARS scores mainly resulted from markedly higher scores for tremor and limb ataxia, respectively. The female carrier (n = 14) and control groups (n = 8) did not differ on any measure. The FMR1 premutation is associated with increased levels of CGG repeat-containing FMR1 mRNA, which may predispose to these symptoms by interfering with nuclear mechanisms. Given the relatively high population frequency of the FMR1 premutation, this mutation may be a significant cause of late-onset ""idiopathic"" progressive tremor."
"Multipotential human central nervous system progenitor cells, isolated from human fetal brain tissue by selective growth conditions, were cultured as undifferentiated, attached cell layers. Selective differentiation yielded highly purified populations of neurons or astrocytes. This report describes the novel use of this cell culture model to study cell type-specific recognition of a human neurotropic virus, JC virus. Infection by either JC virions or a plasmid encoding the JC genome demonstrated susceptibility in astrocytes and, to a lesser degree, progenitor cells, whereas neurons remained nonpermissive. JC virus susceptibility correlated with significantly higher expression of the NFI-X transcription factor in astrocytes than in neurons. Furthermore, transfection of an NFI-X expression vector into progenitor-derived neuronal cells before infection resulted in viral protein production. These results indicate that susceptibility to JC virus infection occurs at the molecular level and also suggest that differential recognition of the viral promoter sequences can predict lineage pathways of multipotential progenitor cells in the human central nervous system."
"Parkin, an E2-dependent ubiquitin protein ligase, carries pathogenic mutations in patients with autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism, but its role in the late-onset form of Parkinson's disease (PD) is not firmly established. Previously, we detected linkage of idiopathic PD to the region on chromosome 6 containing the Parkin gene (D6S305, logarithm of odds score, 5.47) in families with at least one subject with age at onset (AAO) younger than 40 years. Mutation analysis of the Parkin gene in the 174 multiplex families from the genomic screen and 133 additional PD families identified mutations in 18% of early-onset and 2% of late-onset families (5% of total families screened). The AAO of patients with Parkin mutations ranged from 12 to 71 years. Excluding exon 7 mutations, the mean AAO of patients with Parkin mutations was 31.5 years. However, mutations in exon 7, the first RING finger (Cys253Trp, Arg256Cys, Arg275Trp, and Asp280Asn) were observed primarily in heterozygous PD patients with a much later AAO (mean AAO, 49.2 years) but were not found in controls in this study or several previous reports (920 chromosomes). These findings suggest that mutations in Parkin contribute to the common form of PD and that heterozygous mutations, especially those lying in exon 7, act as susceptibility alleles for late-onset form of Parkinson disease."
"Neurophysiological studies in animals show that basal ganglia are involved not only in motor and nonmotor timing functions but also in integrating tactile and visual signals delivered in the peripersonal space. We tested temporal discrimination of cross-modal and unimodal stimuli in 13 controls and 14 patients with writer's cramp, a disorder supposedly linked to dysfunction of basal ganglia. Subjects were asked to discriminate whether pairs of visual, tactile, or visuotactile stimuli were simultaneous or sequential (temporal discrimination threshold) and which stimulus preceded the other (temporal order judgment). Patients were impaired in temporal processing of tactile and cross-modal stimuli. A significant positive correlation between temporal deficits and the severity of disability was detected for both affected and unaffected sides. Findings suggest that multimodal and not only modality-specific temporal processing is defective in focal hand dystonia. Deficits of temporal processing of stimuli delivered to the unaffected side may represent a behavioral index of the susceptibility to develop dystonia and thus have remarkable practical and theoretical implications."
"Using (11)C-raclopride positron emission tomography after methamphetamine challenge, we have evaluated regional brain changes in synaptic dopamine (DA) levels in six volunteers and six advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. The pharmacological challenge induced significant release of endogenous DA in putamen not only in the normal subjects, as reflected by a 25.2% reduction in (11)C-raclopride binding potential as compared with placebo, but also in the PD patients (6.8%). In individual PD patients, we found a correlation between putamen DA release and DA storage, as measured by (18)F-dopa uptake. Localization of significant changes in (11)C-raclopride binding after methamphetamine at a voxel level with statistical parametric mapping identified striatal and prefrontal DA release in both cohorts. Statistical comparisons between normal subjects and PD confirmed significantly reduced DA release in striatal areas in PD, but normal levels of prefrontal DA release. In conclusion, significant endogenous DA release can still be induced by pharmacological challenges in the putamen of advanced PD patients, and this release correlates with residual DA storage capacity. Our data also show that the capacity to release normal DA levels in prefrontal areas after a pharmacological challenge is preserved in severe stages of the disease."
Striatal dysfunction is thought to underlie many dystonias. We used [(123)I]iodobenzovesamicol single-photon emission computed tomography imaging to determine the density of cholinergic terminals in the striatum and other brain regions in 13 subjects with idiopathic cervical dystonia. Striatal [(131)I]iodobenzovesamicol binding was reduced. These results support a role for striatal dysfunction in idiopathic dystonias and suggest diminished striatal cholinergic interneuron density in cervical dystonia.
"Serial magnetic resonance images of 27 patients with untreated World Health Organization grade II oligodendrogliomas or mixed gliomas were reviewed retrospectively to study the kinetics of tumor growth before anaplastic transformation. Analysis of the mean tumor diameters over time showed constant growth. Linear regression, using a mixed model, found an average slope of 4.1mm per year (95% confidence interval, 3.8-4.4mm/year). Untreated low-grade oligodendrogliomas or mixed gliomas grow continuously during their premalignant phase, and their pattern of growth can be predicted within a relatively narrow range. These findings could be of interest to optimize patients management and follow-up."
"In healthy individuals, motor training elicits cortical plasticity that encodes the kinematic details of the practiced movements and is thought to underlie recovery of function after stroke. The influence of age on this form of plasticity is incompletely understood. We studied 55 healthy subjects and identified a substantial decrease in training-dependent plasticity as a function of age in the absence of differences in training kinematics. These results suggest that the ability of the healthy aging motor cortex to reorganize in response to training decreases with age."
"Excitotoxic cell death is the fundamental process responsible for many human neurodegenerative disorders, yet the basic mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Here, we exploited the fact that the immature brain is remarkably resistant to seizure-induced excitotoxic cell death and examined the underlying protective mechanisms. We found that, unlike in the adult, seizures do not increase the formation of reactive oxygen species or result in mitochondrial dysfunction in neonatal brain, because of high levels of the mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP2). UCP2 expression and function were basally increased in neonatal brain by the fat-rich diet of maternal milk, and substituting a low-fat diet reduced UCP2, restored mitochondrial coupling, and permitted seizure-induced neuronal injury. Thus, modulation of UCP2 expression and function by dietary fat protects neonatal neurons from excitotoxicity by preventing mitochondrial dysfunction. This mechanism offers novel neuroprotective strategies for individuals, greater than 1% of the world's population, who are affected by seizures."
"We examined the localization of cerebral functions in 28 patients with focal epilepsy and malformations of cortical development (MCDs). Polymicrogyria occurred in nine, hemimegalencephaly in four, heterotopia in eight, and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) in nine cases. We used simple (sensomotor, visual) or complex (language, memory) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigms. Two thirds of MCDs were activated by simple fMRI paradigms, whereas they less frequently showed activity during complex cognitive fMRI paradigms. During simple paradigms, all disturbances of cortical organization (polymicrogyria, schizencephaly, and mild-type FCD) showed activity, whereas other MCDs (disturbances of earlier steps of cortical development: hemimegalencephaly, Taylor-type FCD, and heterotopia) showed activity in only 44% (p &lt; 0.01). The association between the pathophysiology and morphology of MCDs confirms the recently proposed classification system. Both focal neurological signs (p &lt; 0.05) and focal electroencephalogram slowing (p &lt; 0.05) independently correlated with MCD inactivity, confirming that fMRI showed neuronal functions of MCDs. Conclusively, fMRI visualizes the MCD functions and their relationship to the eloquent cortex, providing useful information before epilepsy surgery. Surgery of cortical organization disturbances should be cautiously performed because these malformations may participate to some degree in brain functions."
"Children born preterm provide a fruitful population for studying structure-function relationships because they often have specific functional deficits in the context of normal neurological status. We selected a group of preterm adolescents with deficits in judgment of line orientation. Despite their very low birth weight, all were neurologically normal with no consistent abnormalities on conventional magnetic resonance imaging. However, voxel-based morphometric analysis of their magnetic resonance imaging scans showed areas of decreased gray matter and increased white matter most prominently in right ventral extrastriate cortex, close to an area previously implicated in the line orientation task. We suggest that these anomalies of cortical architecture relate to impaired performance on the line orientation task."
"Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by a loss of atonia and an increase in phasic muscle activity during REM sleep, leading to complex nocturnal motor behaviors. Brainstem structures responsible for the pathogenesis of RBD are also implicated in cortical activation. To verify the hypothesis that electroencephalogram (EEG) activation will be impaired in RBD, we performed quantitative analyses of waking and REM sleep EEG in 15 idiopathic RBD patients and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects. During wakefulness, RBD patients showed a considerably higher theta power in frontal, temporal, and occipital regions with a lower beta power in the occipital region. The dominant occipital frequency was significantly lower in RBD. During REM sleep, beta power in the occipital region was lower in RBD. This study shows for the first time an impaired cortical activation during both wakefulness and REM sleep in idiopathic RBD, despite an absence of changes on sleep architecture compared with controls. EEG slowing in these patients may represent an early sign of central nervous system dysfunction, perhaps paralleled by subclinical cognitive deficits. The topographical distribution of EEG slowing and possible pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed in light of the known association between RBD and neurodegenerative disorders."
"A three-nucleotide (GAG) deletion in the TOR1A gene is the most common cause of inherited dystonia, DYT1. Because the mutant protein, TorsinA (TA), is thought to act in a dominant manner to cause disease, inhibiting expression from the mutant gene represents a potentially powerful therapeutic strategy. In an effort to develop therapy for this disease, we tested whether small interfering RNA (siRNA) could selectively silence expression of mutant TA. Exploiting the three-base pair difference between wild-type and mutant alleles, we designed siRNAs to silence expression of mutant, wild-type, or both forms of TA. In transfected cells, siRNA successfully suppressed wild-type or mutant TA in an allele-specific manner: for example, mutant-specific siRNA reduced the levels of mutant TA to less than 1% of controls with minimal effect on wild-type TA expression. In cells expressing both alleles, thus simulating the heterozygous state, siRNA-mediated suppression remained robust and allele specific. Our siRNA studies demonstrate allele-specific targeting of a dominant neurogenetic disease gene and suggest the broad therapeutic potential of siRNA for DYT1 dystonia and other dominantly inherited neurological diseases."
"Emotional blunting can be found after cerebellar lesions. However, the mechanism of such a modification is not clear. We present a patient with emotional flattening and increased risk taking after left cerebellar infarct who had an impaired autonomic reactivity to negative as compared with positive reinforcement. This impairment was demonstrated by the patient's undifferentiated skin conductance responses to negative and positive reinforcement, whereas controls produced larger skin conductance responses after negative feedback. The cooccurrence of emotional flattening and undifferentiated autonomic reactions to positively and negatively valenced stimuli strengthens the role of the cerebellum in the modulation of the autonomic responses."
"Characteristics of alcoholic neuropathy have been obscured by difficulty in isolating them from features of thiamine-deficiency neuropathy. We assessed 64 patients with alcoholic neuropathy including subgroups without (ALN) and with (ALN-TD) coexisting thiamine deficiency. Thirty-two patients with nonalcoholic thiamine-deficiency neuropathy (TDN) also were investigated for comparison. In ALN, clinical symptoms were sensory-dominant and slowly progressive, predominantly impairing superficial sensation (especially nociception) with pain or painful burning sensation. In TDN, most cases manifested a motor-dominant and acutely progressive pattern, with impairment of both superficial and deep sensation. Small-fiber-predominant axonal loss in sural nerve specimens was characteristic of ALN, especially with a short history of neuropathy; long history was associated with regenerating small fibers. Large-fiber-predominant axonal loss predominated in TDN. Subperineurial edema was more prominent in TDN, whereas segmental de/remyelination resulting from widening of consecutive nodes of Ranvier was more frequent in ALN. Myelin irregularity was greater in ALN. ALN-TD showed a variable mixture of these features in ALN and TDN. We concluded that pure-form of alcoholic neuropathy (ALN) was distinct from pure-form of thiamine-deficiency neuropathy (TDN), supporting the view that alcoholic neuropathy can be caused by direct toxic effect of ethanol or its metabolites. However, features of alcoholic neuropathy is influenced by concomitant thiamine-deficiency state, having so far caused the obscure clinicopathological entity of alcoholic neuropathy."
"Primary (AL; immunoglobulin light-chain associated) amyloidosis is characterized by the deposition of pathological proteins in the extracellular matrix of tissues and organs. Autonomic and sensory peripheral neuropathy is a common feature of this disorder. The pathogenesis of the neuropathy is poorly defined. The aims of this study were to investigate vascular and neural function in the cutaneous microcirculation of AL amyloidosis patients. Seven patients with AL amyloidosis and controls were studied. Acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside were iontophoresed into the forearm skin. Endothelial, smooth muscle, and C-fiber-mediated cutaneous blood flow (CuBF) were recorded by laser Doppler flowmetry. Endothelial vasodilation in the forearm skin was attenuated in AL amyloidosis patients (p = 0.007). Maximum endothelium-mediated CuBF in the patient group was reduced (p = 0.047). No group differences could be detected in the C-fiber response or smooth muscle vasodilation (p value not significant). Maximum C-fiber and endothelium-independent CuBF did not differ between the two groups (p value not significant). Early in the disease, AL amyloidosis patients present with impaired endothelial function. At this stage, C-fiber and smooth muscle function are still preserved. These data suggest that endothelial abnormalities precede and may contribute to the pathogenesis of the neuropathy associated with AL amyloidosis."
"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is characterized by parenchymal hematoma formation with surrounding inflammation. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases defined by inflammation and cell death. To investigate the expression profile and pathogenic aspects of MMPs in ICH, we examined MMP expression in vivo using a collagenase-induced rat model of ICH. ICH increased brain MMP-2, -3, -7, and -9 mRNA levels relative to sham-injected (control) animals in the vicinity of the hematoma, but MMP-12 (macrophage metalloelastase) was the most highly induced MMP (&gt;80-fold). Immunohistochemistry showed MMP-12 to be localized in activated monocytoid cells surrounding the hematoma. In vitro studies showed that thrombin, released during ICH, induced MMP-12 expression in monocytoid cells, which was reduced by minocycline application. Similarly, in vivo minocycline treatment significantly reduced MMP-12 levels in brain. Neuropathological studies disclosed marked glial activation and apoptosis after ICH that was reduced by minocycline treatment. Neurobehavioral outcomes also were improved with minocycline treatment compared with untreated ICH controls. Thus, select MMPs exhibit increased expression after ICH, whereas minocycline is neuroprotective after ICH by suppressing monocytoid cell activation and downregulating MMP-12 expression."
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease with no cure. In a transgenic mouse model of ALS, creatine monohydrate showed a promising increase in survival. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential clinical trial to assess the effect of creatine monohydrate on survival and disease progression in patients with ALS. Between June 2000 and December 2001, 175 patients with probable, probable-laboratory supported, or definite ALS were randomly assigned to receive either creatine monohydrate or placebo 10 gm daily. A sequential trial design was used with death, persistent assisted ventilation, or tracheostomy as primary end points. Secondary outcome measurements were rate of decline of isometric arm muscle strength, forced vital capacity, functional status, and quality of life. The trial was stopped when the null hypothesis of indifference was accepted. Creatine did not affect survival (cumulative survival probability of 0.70 in the creatine group vs 0.68 in the placebo group at 12 months, and 0.52 in the creatine group vs 0.47 in the placebo group at 16 months), or the rate of decline of functional measurements. Creatine intake did not cause important adverse reactions. This placebo-controlled trial did not find evidence of a beneficial effect of creatine monohydrate on survival or disease progression in patients with ALS."
"We demonstrate that the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors atorvastatin and simvastatin enhance functional outcome and induce brain plasticity when administered after stroke to rats. With atorvastatin treatment initiated 1 day after stroke, animals exhibited significant increases in vascular endothelial growth factor, cyclic guanosine monophosphate, angiogenesis, endogenous cell proliferation and neurogenesis, and an increase in the synaptic protein, synaptophysin. Atorvastatin-induced angiogenesis in a tube formation assay was reduced by an antibody against the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (FIK-1) and by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N-mono-methyl-L-arginine (L-NAME). Atorvastatin also induced phosphorylation of Akt and Erk in cultured primary cortical neurons. These data indicate that atorvastatin induced brain plasticity and has neurorestorative activity after experimental stroke."
"We analyzed the clinical characteristics of 18 patients (13 female, 5 male) who had autoimmune autonomic neuropathy (AAN) and ganglionic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) autoantibodies. Mean age was 61.4 years (standard deviation, 12.0 years). Ten patients had subacute symptom onset, six with an antecedent event. Eight patients had chronic AAN, characterized by insidious symptom onset, without antecedent event, and gradual progression. A majority of patients with high antibody values (&gt;1.00 nmol/L) had a combination of sicca complex (marked dry eyes and dry mouth), abnormal pupillary light response, upper gastrointestinal symptoms, and neurogenic bladder. Chronic AAN segregated into two subgroups. One subgroup (N = 4) had low antibody titer (0.09 +/- 0.01 nmol/L) and a paucity of cholinergic symptoms. It was indistinguishable from pure autonomic failure. The other subgroup (N = 4) had high antibody titer (11.6 +/- 2.08 nmol/L), sicca complex, abnormal pupils, and neurogenic bladder; three had severe upper gastrointestinal dysfunction. Higher antibody titers correlated with greater autonomic dysfunction and more frequent cholinergic dysautonomia. These observations expand the clinical spectrum of AAN to include chronic cases, some being indistinguishable from pure autonomic failure, and support the concept that ganglionic AChR antibodies are important diagnostically and pathophysiologically in acquired dysautonomia."
"Neurodevelopmental disorders could be caused by maternal antibodies or other serum factors. We detected serum antibodies binding to rodent Purkinje cells and other neurons in a mother of three children: the first normal, the second with autism, and the third with a severe specific language disorder. We injected the serum (0.5-1.0 ml/day) into pregnant mice during gestation and found altered exploration and motor coordination and changes in cerebellar magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the mouse offspring, comparing with offspring of mice injected with sera from mothers of healthy children. This evidence supports a role for maternal antibodies in some forms of neurodevelopmental disorder."
"We describe 22 patients with mutations in the fukutin-related protein (FKPR) gene. Four patients had congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1C), with presentation at birth, severe weakness and inability to stand unsupported. The other 18 had limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2I). Eleven showed a Duchenne-like course with loss of ambulation in the early teens while 7 had a milder phenotype. Muscle biopsy invariably showed abnormal expression of a-dystroglycan. MDC1C patients either carried 2 missense or 1 missense and 1 nonsense mutations. Patients with LGMD2I shared a common mutation (C826A,Leu276Ileu) and their phenotypic severity was correlated with the second allelic mutation."
"Distractibility, which can be defined as an attention deficit in which orientation toward irrelevant targets can be hardly inhibited, is commonly related to a dysfunction of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Here, we show that increased distractibility, observed in a patient with an exceptionally small lesion located in the upper brainstem, may result from the interruption of a direct tract that connects the prefrontal cortex to the superior colliculus, a structure involved in both eye movement control and attentional shifts."
"The neuromuscular aspects of West Nile virus (WNV) infection have not been characterized in detail. We have studied a group of six patients with proven WNV infection. All cases presented with acute, severe, asymmetric, or monolimb weakness, with minimal or no sensory disturbance after a mild flu-like prodrome. Four cases also had facial weakness. Three of our cases had no encephalitic signs or symptoms despite cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. Electrophysiological studies showed severe denervation in paralyzed limb muscles, suggesting either motor neuron or multiple ventral nerve root damage. This localization is supported further by the finding of abnormal signal intensity confined to the anterior horns on a lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging. Muscle biopsies from three patients showed scattered necrotic fibers, implicating mild direct or indirect muscle damage from the WNV infection. In summary, we describe a group of patients with acute segmental flaccid paralysis with minimal or no encephalitic or sensory signs. We have localized the abnormality to either the spinal motor neurons or their ventral nerve roots. It will be important for physicians to consider WNV infection in patients with acute asymmetric paralysis with or without encephalitic symptoms."
"Identification of genes involved in human cerebral development is important for our understanding of disorders with potential neurodevelopmental causes such as epilepsy and learning disability. Murine models suggest that PAX6 plays a key role in human brain development. With magnetic resonance imaging in 24 humans heterozygous for defined PAX6 mutations, we demonstrated widespread structural abnormalities including absence of the pineal gland and unilateral polymicrogyria."
"We prospectively examined the changes of body weight among 468 individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) before and after the diagnosis. The average weight of PD patients was stable until shortly before the diagnosis (p for trend = 0.2) and then declined (p for trend &lt; 0.0001). Interestingly, PD patients tended to increase their energy intakes as their weights decreased (p for trend &lt; 0.002). In conclusion, weight loss in PD patients appears to be a continuous process that starts several years before the diagnosis and is not caused by reduced energy intake."
"We demonstrate a role for immune functions in the spontaneous remyelination of central nervous system (CNS) axons after lysolecithin-induced demyelination in the spinal cord. Rag-1-deficient mice lack both B cells and T cells and show significantly reduced spontaneous remyelination compared with control mice of matching genetic background. Mice lacking or depleted of either CD4(+) T cells or CD8(+) T cells also exhibit reduced remyelination. These data indicate that T cells are necessary for efficient CNS remyelination. Thus, general nonspecific immunosuppression as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of CNS injury and demyelinating disease may have undesirable effects on subsequent tissue repair."
"p34cdc2, collapsin response mediator protein 4 (CRMP4), doublecortin (DCX), HuD, and NeuN expression was assessed in tuber (n = 16) and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA; n = 6) specimens in tuberous sclerosis complex to define the developmental phenotype and lineage of giant cells (CGs) in these lesions. Many GCs exhibited HuD and NeuN immunolabeling suggesting a differentiated neural phenotype. Giant cells in tubers, SEGAs and subependymal nodules in the Eker rat model of TSC expressed CRMP4 and DCX. Tubers and SEGAs exhibit a heterogeneous profile of differentiation and may share a common cellular lineage. Tubers may contain a subpopulation of newly generated cells."
"In clinically isolated syndromes, the new McDonald criteria for multiple sclerosis diagnosis require new gadolinium-enhancing lesions for dissemination in time at a 3-month follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scan. In a cohort of 56 patients, these criteria were specific (95%) but less sensitive (58%) for clinically definite multiple sclerosis at 3 years. If new T2 lesions were allowed as an alternative for dissemination in time, sensitivity increased (74%) with maintained specificity (92%), enabling an accurate diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in more patients."
"We studied a patient with idiopathic generalized epilepsy and frequent absences, using electroencephalogram-correlated functional magnetic resonance imaging. Four prolonged runs of generalized spike-wave discharge occurred during a 35-minute experiment. Time-locked activation was observed bilaterally within the thalami in conjunction with widespread but symmetrical cortical deactivation with a frontal maximum. We demonstrate the reciprocal participation of focal thalamic and widespread cortical networks during human absence seizures and suggest reductions in cortical blood flow, in response to synchronized electroencephalogram activity."
"Autoantibodies have defined two paraneoplastic visual disorders related to small-cell lung carcinoma: retinopathy (""CAR""-IgG [23kDa, recoverin]) and optic neuritis collapsin response-mediated protein 5 (CRMP-5-IgG [62kDa]). Among 16 patients with CRMP-5-IgG and optic neuritis (aged 52-74 years; all smokers, 9 women), we documented coexisting retinitis in 5. None had CAR-IgG. Fifteen had subacute vision loss, swollen optic discs, and field defects. Vascular leakage was evident at and remote from the disc; 5/5 tested had abnormal electroretinograms. Nine had striking vitreous cells. Vitrectomy showed reactive lymphocytosis (4/4), predominantly CD4(+) (1/1). Most patients had multifocal neurological accompaniments. Cerebrospinal fluid contained lymphocytes (7-32), elevated protein, multiple oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands, and CRMP-5-IgG. Three patients superficially resembled Devic's disease at presentation. One autopsied patient had predominantly CD8(+) T lymphocytes infiltrating optic nerve and spinal cord. Eleven patients had confirmed small-cell carcinoma; 1 had imaging evidence of lung cancer; 3 had renal or thyroid carcinoma. Full-length CRMP-5 protein was identified in normal retina and optic nerve by Western blot analyses. Photoreceptor cells, retinal ganglion cells, and nerve fibers exhibited CRMP-5-specific immunoreactivity. In summary, CRMP-5-IgG defines a paraneoplastic ophthalmological entity of combined optic neuritis and retinitis with vitreous inflammatory cells. Positive serology obviates the need for vitreous biopsy and expedites the search for cancer."
"DCX mutations cause mental retardation in male subjects with lissencephalypachygyria and in female subjects with subcortical band heterotopia (SBH). We observed four families in which carrier women had normal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mild mental retardation, with or without epilepsy. Affected male subjects had SBH or pachygyria-SBH. In two families, the phenotype was mild in both genders. In the first family, we found a tyr138his mutation that is predicted to result in abnormal folding in the small hinge region. In the second family, we found an arg178cys mutation at the initial portion of R2, in the putative beta-sheet structure. Carrier female subjects with normal MRI showed no somatic mosaicism or altered X-inactivation in lymphocytes, suggesting a correlation between mild mutations and phenotypes. In the two other families, with severely affected boys, we found arg76ser and arg56gly mutations within the R1 region that are predicted to affect DCX folding, severely modifying its activity. Both carrier mothers showed skewed X-inactivation, possibly explaining their mild phenotypes. Missense DCX mutations may manifest as non-syndromic mental retardation with cryptogenic epilepsy in female subjects and SBH in boys. Mutation analysis in mothers of affected children is mandatory, even when brain MRI is normal."
"A primary therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease includes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors with the goal of enhancing cholinergic transmission. Stimulation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) by elevated levels of ACh plays a role in the effects of AChE inhibitors on cognition and behavior. However, AChE inhibitors only demonstrate modest symptomatic improvements. Chronic treatment with these drugs may cause mAChR downregulation and consequently limit the treatment efficacy. AChE knockout (-/-) mice were utilized in this study as a model for investigating the effects of selective, complete, and chronic diminished AChE activity on mAChR expression and function. In AChE -/- mice, the M(1), M(2), and M(4) mAChRs showed strikingly 50 to 80% decreased expression in brain regions associated with memory. In addition, mAChRs showed decreased presynaptic, cell surface, and dendritic distributions and increased localization to intracellular puncta. Furthermore, mAChR agonist-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, a signaling pathway associated with synaptic plasticity and amyloidogenesis, is diminished in the hippocampus and cortex of AChE -/- mice. Therefore, chronic diminished ACh metabolism produces profound effects on mAChR expression and function. The alterations of mAChRs in AChE -/- mice suggest that mAChR downregulation may contribute to the limited efficacy of AChE inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease treatment."
"We studied the effect of transcranial 2 MHz Doppler ultrasound (US) on the recanalization and outcome of stroke patients suffering from acute middle cerebral artery occlusion. All patients underwent intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator thrombolysis. Eleven patients were randomly selected for continuous US monitoring (C-US) over 1 hour; 14 patients were selected for the control group. The C-US group showed a higher grade of recanalization after 1 hour but also a higher number of intraparenchymal bleedings. Overall, a favorable functional outcome occurred more frequently in the C-US group (Barthel index, p = 0.037) after 3 months."
"Unilateral lesions of the occipital visual areas performed on postnatal day 5 (P5) in the ferret are not compensated by the appearance, in the lesioned hemisphere, of visual responses at ectopic locations. Instead, when parts of the visual areas are spared, they show abnormal retinotopic organizations; furthermore, callosal connections are abnormally distributed in relation to the retinotopic maps. Lesions that completely eliminate the visual areas including the posterior parietal cortex cause the appearance of abnormal callosal connections from the primary somatosensory cortex on the lesion side to the contralateral, intact, posterior parietal cortex. The occipital visual areas (17, 18, 19, and 21) of the intact hemisphere show a normal retinotopy but lose callosal connections in territories homotopic to the lesions. These findings clarify the nature and limits of structural developmental plasticity in the visual cortex. Early in life, certain regions of cortex have been irreversibly allocated to the visual areas, but two properties defining the areas, that is, retinotopy and connections, remain modifiable. The findings might be relevant for understanding the consequences of early-onset visual cortical lesions in humans."
"Previous observations suggested that multiple ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) are common in acute stroke patients. We hypothesized that a source of these multiple lesions was the recurrence of ischemic lesions within a week after a clinically symptomatic stroke. We analyzed 99 acute ischemic stroke patients scanned within 6 hours of onset and at subsequent times within the first week. Ischemic lesion recurrence was defined as any new lesion separate from the index lesion. Recurrent lesions occurring outside initial perfusion deficit were termed 'distant lesion recurrence'. We estimated the hazard ratio (HR) of recurrence associated with clinical and imaging characteristics using log-rank test. Any lesion recurrence was found in 34%, with distant lesion recurrence in 15%, while clinical recurrence was evident in 2%. Initial multiple DWI lesions were associated with any lesion recurrence (HR, 2.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-10.29; p = 0.002) and with distant lesion recurrence (HR, 5.99; 95% CI, 4.05-64.07; p &lt; 0.0001). Large-artery atherosclerosis was the most frequent stroke subtype associated with any lesion recurrence (p = 0.026). These results may indicate a prolonged state of increased ischemic risk over the first week and suggest DWI as a possible surrogate measure for recurrent stroke."
"Although 1 of 10 nursing home residents is taking an antiepileptic drug (AED), no study to our knowledge has determined whether most residents are already receiving AED treatment when they are admitted or are given these drugs afterward. That differentiation was the focus of this study. The study group consisted of 10,318 residents, 65 years and older, admitted to 510 nursing homes located throughout the United States during the first quarter of 1999. AED prevalence at admission was 7.7%; three fifths had an epilepsy/seizure indication. In a multivariate analysis, factors associated with AED use at admission included epilepsy/seizure, bipolar depression, age group, and cognitive performance. In the follow-up cohort (N = 9,516), postadmission initiation of AEDs was 2.7%; one fifth had an epilepsy/seizure indication. In the multivariate analysis, factors associated with postadmission AED initiation included epilepsy/seizure indication, bipolar depression, age group, peripheral vascular disease, and cognitive performance. This rate of AED postadmission initiation within the first 3 months of admission was much higher than expected, suggesting that new symptoms may develop after admission. Results also show that the rate of AED use in nursing homes is not static."
"The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between the level of mutated mitochondrial DNA in muscle and oxidative capacity in 24 patients with mitochondrial myopathy (MM). Maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)), workload (W(max)), and venous plasma lactate levels were measured during an incremental cycle test to exhaustion in 17 patients with point mutations of mtDNA and in seven with single, large-scale deletions of mtDNA (chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia [CPEO]). Results were compared with those in 25 healthy matched subjects. The mutation load in MM patients was 67 +/- 5% (range, 29 - 99%). VO(2max) and W(max) correlated with percentage of heteroplasmy (r &gt; 0.82; p &lt; 0.005) and were lower in patients versus healthy subjects (p &lt; 0.000005). Exercise-induced peak increases in heart rate, ventilation, and resting plasma lactate levels correlated with muscle mutation load (r &gt; 0.71; p &lt; 0.005). Exercise-induced increases in plasma lactate correlated with muscle mutation load in CPEO patients (r = 0.95; p &lt; 0.005). Impaired oxidative capacity and ragged red muscle fibers were found in CPEO and 3243A--&gt;G patients with mutation loads as low as 45 and 57%, respectively. The study indicates that oxidative capacity correlates directly with skeletal muscle mutation load in MM patients, and that the mutation threshold level for impaired oxidative metabolism in MM patients is lower than found in in vitro studies."
"Two autistic children with a chromosome 15q11-q13 inverted duplication are presented. Both had uneventful perinatal courses, normal electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging scans, moderate motor delay, lethargy, severe hypotonia, and modest lactic acidosis. Both had muscle mitochondrial enzyme assays that showed a pronounced mitochondrial hyperproliferation and a partial respiratory chain block most parsimoniously placed at the level of complex III, suggesting candidate gene loci for autism within the critical region may affect pathways influencing mitochondrial function."
"We tested whether a regular exercise regimen was associated with a change in the life span of G93A-SOD1 transgenic mice, a model of familial ALS. Regular treadmill running for 10 weeks led to a significant increase in the life span of G93A-SOD1 mice. The effect was stronger in male mice, whereas there was only a trend between exercised and sedentary female G93A-SOD1 mice. The data suggest that regular exercise has a beneficial effect on the progression of ALS."
"An infant presented with massive hyperchylomicronemia and a severe encephalopathy. MRI showed marked lipid deposition throughout the brain. Despite the normalization of the biochemistry, there was little clinical improvement, and at 18 months of age she has severe developmental delay, a strikingly abnormal MRI. Apolipoprotein C-II, the lipoprotein on chylomicrons responsible for the activation of lipoprotein lipase, was not detectable in blood. Analysis of the APO C-II gene revealed a novel homozygous point mutation, 1118C--&gt;A. Subsequently, another sibling has been born with the same homozygous mutation and similar biochemistry but, perhaps because of early treatment, a normal neurological outcome."
"Previous brain imaging and mapping studies have reported findings indicating functional reorganization in the central auditory pathways of patients with profound unilateral hearing loss. This study reports for the first time to our knowledge, using a whole-head neuromagnetometer with monaural stimulation of both intact and affected ears, a pattern of healthy-side dominance for cortical neuromagnetic responses in adult patients in the early stage of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, and a pattern of contralateral dominance is verified in controls."
"Several new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have been introduced for clinical use recently. These new AEDs, as did the classic AEDs, target multiple cellular sites both pre- and postsynaptically. The major common goal of the pharmacological treatment using AEDs is to counteract abnormal brain excitability by either decreasing excitatory transmission or enhancing neuronal inhibition. Interestingly, an excessive release of excitatory amino acids and a reduced neuronal inhibition also occur in brain ischemia. Thus, recently, the use of AEDs as a possible neuroprotective strategy in brain ischemia is receiving increasing attention, and many AEDs have been tested in animal models of stroke, providing encouraging results. Experimental studies utilizing global or focal ischemia in rodents have provided insights into the possible neuroprotective action of the various AEDs. However, the implication of these studies in the treatment of acute stroke in humans is not always direct. In fact, various clinical studies with drugs targeting the same voltage- and ligand-gated channels modulated by most of the AEDs failed to show neuroprotection. The differential mechanisms that underlie the development of focal ischemic injury in experimental animal models versus human stroke require further investigation to open a new therapeutic perspective for neuroprotection that might be applicable in the future."
"In a group of 331 sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases, we identified a new Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase single base substitution, N19S, in two patients. In the first case, seven healthy family members of 15 carried the substitution. Controls (n = 268) and familial ALS index cases (n = 180) were screened and one control subject with N19S was identified. Our data show that, despite a possible role of susceptibility factor for ALS, N19S alone cannot be considered as a direct cause for the disease."
"In the search for proteins that might play a role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS), osteopontin (OPN) has been identified as the most prominent cytokine-encoding gene expressed within MS lesions. Here, we report significantly increased OPN protein levels in plasma of relapsing-remitting MS patients. In contrast, OPN protein levels in primary progressive and secondary progressive MS patients were similar to healthy control levels. Interestingly, active relapsing-remitting patients had higher OPN protein levels than patients without relapses."
"Direct sequencing of exons 3 to 35 and the exon-intron boundaries of the CACNA1H gene was conducted in 118 childhood absence epilepsy patients of Han ethnicity recruited from North China. Sixty-eight variations have been detected in the CACNA1H gene, and, among the variations identified, 12 were missense mutations and only found in 14 of the 118 patients in a heterozygous state, but not in any of 230 unrelated controls. The identified missense mutations occurred in the highly conserved residues of the T-type calcium channel gene. Our results suggest that CACNA1H might be an important susceptibility gene involved in the pathogenesis of childhood absence epilepsy."
"To evaluate the significance of expanded CTG repeats at the SCA8 locus, we analyzed the allele distribution in 1,262 German ataxia patients. We found intermediate and expanded CTG repeats with similar frequencies in ataxia patients with and without established genetic diseases. One family linked to the SCA8 locus showed incomplete penetrance and an association of smaller CTG repeats with more severe disease. Our data question the disease-causing character of CTG expansions for SCA8 and advise great caution in genetic testing."
"Preclinical studies suggest ropinirole (a D2/D3 dopamine agonist) may be neuroprotective in Parkinson's disease (PD), and a pilot clinical study using (18)F-dopa positron emission tomography (PET) suggested a slower loss of striatal dopamine storage with ropinirole compared with levodopa. This prospective, 2-year, randomized, double-blind, multinational study compared the rates of loss of dopamine-terminal function in de novo patients with clinical and (18)F-dopa PET evidence of early PD, randomized 1 to 1 to receive either ropinirole or levodopa. The primary outcome measure was reduction in putamen (18)F-dopa uptake (Ki) between baseline and 2-year PET. Of 186, 162 randomized patients were eligible for analysis. A blinded, central, region-of-interest analysis showed a significantly lower reduction (p = 0.022) in putamen Ki over 2 years with ropinirole (-13.4%; n = 68) compared with levodopa (-20.3%; n = 59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-13.06). Statistical parametric mapping localized lesser reductions in (18)F-dopa uptake in the putamen and substantia nigra with ropinirole. The greatest Ki decrease in each group was in the putamen (ropinirole, -14.1%; levodopa, -22.9%; 95% CI, 4.24-13.3), but the decrease was significantly lower with ropinirole compared with levodopa (p &lt; 0.001). Ropinirole is associated with slower progression of PD than levodopa as assessed by (18)F-dopa PET."
"Previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies have shown that nonmanifesting carriers of the DYT1 dystonia mutation express an abnormal pattern of resting glucose metabolism. To determine whether motor behavior is impaired in these subjects, we compared movement and sequence learning in 12 clinically unaffected DYT1 carriers with 12 age-matched controls. Regional differences in brain function during task performance were assessed with simultaneous H(2) (15)O/PET. We found that motor performance was similar in the DYT1 and control groups, with no significant differences in movement time and spatial accuracy measured during each of the tasks. In contrast, sequence learning was reduced in gene carriers relative to controls (p &lt; 0.01). PET imaging during motor execution showed increased activation in gene carriers (p &lt; 0.001, uncorrected) in the left premotor cortex and right supplementary motor area, with concomitant reduction in the posterior medial cerebellum. During sequence learning, activation responses in DYT1 carriers were increased in the left ventral prefrontal cortex, and lateral cerebellum. These findings suggest that abnormalities in motor behavior and brain function exist in clinically nonmanifesting DYT1 carriers. Although localized increases in neural activity may enable normal movement execution in these subjects, this mechanism may not compensate for their defect in sequence learning."
"Cigarette smoking and caffeine consumption are associated with a decreased incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD). This inverse association may result from neuroprotective effects of cigarette smoke and caffeine, or from a disinclination of future PD patients to engage in habituating behaviors. We investigated the association between consumption of alcoholic beverages, another potentially habituating behavior, and risk of PD in two large prospective cohorts Nurses' Health Study, and Health Professionals' Follow-up Study. We detected 415 new cases of PD during follow-up. Compared with nondrinkers at baseline, the relative rate (95% confidence interval) was 1.0 (0.8-1.3) for drinkers of less than 5 gm/day, 1.0 (0.8-1.4) for 5 to less than 15 gm/day, 1.1 (0.8-1.6) for 15 to less than 30 gm/day, and 0.7 (0.5-1.2) for 30 gm/day or more (p for trend = 0.45). Consumption of wine or liquor was not associated with the incidence of PD. Compared with those who consumed beer less than once per month, the relative rate (95% confidence interval) was 0.7 (0.5-0.9) for one to three drinks of beer per month, and 0.7 (0.5, 0.9) for one or more drinks of beer per week. The risk of PD was similar in individuals who usually consume moderate amounts of alcohol and in abstainers."
"Increases in COX-2 enzymatic activity and prostaglandin production have been associated with neuronal injury in both acute and age-related degenerative neurological diseases. In this study, we tested the effects of increased COX-2 activity in a model of transient focal ischemia using a transgenic mouse model in which human COX-2 is constitutively expressed selectively in neurons of the striatum, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus. These COX-2 transgenic mice harbor elevated levels of PGE(2) that are 10-fold higher than nontransgenic levels. A significant increase in infarct volume was observed after middle cerebral artery occlusion with 4 days of reperfusion in COX-2 transgenic mice as compared with nontransgenic littermates. Pretreatment of nontransgenic mice with the selective COX-2 inhibitor SC58236 resulted in a significant reduction of infarct volume in nontransgenic mice, consistent with previous pharmacological studies. However, transgenic COX-2 mice treated with SC58236 did not show a significant reduction. This suggests that chronic increases in COX-2 expression and enzymatic activity, which can occur in aging and in pathological states characterized by oxidative stress and chronic inflammatory processes, can lead to downstream cellular changes that have a negative impact on neuronal survival in cerebrovascular disease."
"To establish phenotype-genotype correlations in early-onset parkinsonism, we have compared the phenotype of a large series of 146 patients with and 250 patients without parkin mutations. Although no single sign distinguished the groups, patients with mutations had significantly earlier and more symmetrical onset, dystonia more often at onset and hyperreflexia, slower progression of the disease, and a tendency toward a greater response to levodopa despite lower doses. After forward stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis, dystonia at onset and brisk reflexes were not longer significantly different but were correlated with age at onset rather than the presence of the parkin mutation. Age at onset in carriers of parkin mutations varied as did the rate of progression of the disease: the younger the age at onset the slower the evolution. The genotype influenced the phenotype: carriers of at least one missense mutation had a higher United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score than those carrying two truncating mutations. The localization of the mutations was also important because missense mutations in functional domains of parkin resulted in earlier onset. Patients with a single heterozygous mutation had significantly later and more asymmetrical onset and more frequent levodopa-induced fluctuations and dystonia than patients with two mutations."
"Huntington's Disease (HD) is an inherited neurological disorder causing movement impairment, personality changes, dementia, and premature death, for which there is currently no effective therapy. The modified tetracycline antibiotic, minocycline, has been reported to ameliorate the disease phenotype in the R6/2 mouse model of HD. Because the tetracyclines have also been reported to inhibit aggregation in other amyloid disorders, we have investigated their ability to inhibit huntingtin aggregation and further explored their efficacy in preclinical mouse trials. We show that tetracyclines are potent inhibitors of huntingtin aggregation in a hippocampal slice culture model of HD at an effective concentration of 30 microM. However, despite achieving tissue levels approaching this concentration by oral treatment of R6/2 mice with minocycline, we observed no clear difference in their behavioral abnormalities, or in aggregate load postmortem. In the light of these new data, we would advise that caution be exercised in proceeding into human clinical trials of minocycline."
"We used immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy applied to fingertip punch biopsy to study glabrous skin innervation in 14 healthy subjects. In addition to epidermal nerve fibers, we quantified mechanoreceptors and their myelinated afferents. Using digital images and dedicated software, we calculated caliber, internodal and nodal length, and G-ratio of the last four internodes of the myelinated endings. In our skin samples, we found a mean density of 59.0 +/- 29.3 myelinated endings per square millimeter with a mean diameter of 3.3 +/- 0.5 microm and an internodal length of 79.1 +/- 13.8 microm. These findings indicate that Abeta fibers undergo drastic changes in their course from the nerve trunk to the target organ, with repeated branching and consequent tapering and shortening of internodal length. Our work demonstrates that skin biopsy can give information on the status of large myelinated endings as well as unmyelinated sensory and autonomic nerves. Since distal endings are primarily involved in distal axonopathy, skin biopsy can be more suitable than sural nerve biopsy to detect early abnormalities. In addition to diagnostic applications, this technique allows clarification of the mode of termination of Abeta fibers and their relationship with mechanoreceptors, leading to relevant electrophysiological speculations."
"Quantitative neuropsychiatry has provided increasingly precise descriptions of behavioral phenotypes associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Degenerative diseases of the brain are disturbances of protein metabolism, with failure of protein degredation by the ubiquitin-proteosome system, production of neurotoxic peptide oligomers, and accumulation of intracellular protein deposits. Abnormalities of amyloid beta peptide, alpha-synuclein protein, and hyperphosphorylated tau protein account for more than 90% of degenerative dementias. Functionally related neuroanatomical systems have shared metabolic characteristics and common vulnerabilities to protein dysmetabolism, providing the basis for phenotypes that reflect the underlying proteotype. Patients with alpha-synuclein disorders are particularly prone to hallucinations, delusions, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. Patients with tauopathies manifest disproportionate disinhibition and apathy, and may exhibit compulsions. Alzheimer's disease is a triple proteinopathy with abnormalities of A-beta, tau, and alpha-synculein leading to a complex behavioral phenotype. This molecular approach to neuropsychiatry may assist in understanding the mechanisms of degenerative diseases, provide insight into the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms, and contribute to monitoring disease-modifying therapies."
"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system with a genetic component. Until now, the more consistent association with the disease is found with the major histocompatibility complex, especially HLA-DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 haplotype. In this report, we demonstrate the interaction of Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4 [CD152]) gene with DRB1*15 haplotype in multiple sclerosis genetic susceptibility. Our data were obtained from two European independent family-based studies including 610 multiple sclerosis family trios. Ann Neurol 2003;54:119-122"
"We recently noted a profound decline in brain sulfatides (ST) in subjects who died with incipient dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we measured ST levels in cerebrospinal fluid in cognitively normal elderly and in subjects with mild cognitive impairment due to incipient demenia of the Alzheimer type. There was a significant decrease in cerebrospinal fluid ST and in the ST to phosphatidylinositol ratio in MCI subjects. The ST to phosphatidylinositol ratio accurately differentiated very mildly impaired subjects from controls on an individual basis. The cerebrospinal fluid ST to phosphatidylinositol ratio may be a very useful biomarker for the earliest clinical stage of Alzheimer's disease."
"The cause of intraventricular hemorrhage in term neonates is poorly understood. Among 29 neonates of at least 36 weeks' gestation with intraventricular hemorrhage, 9 (31%) had cerebral sinovenous thrombosis. Of the 26 neonates who underwent computed tomography or magnetic resonance studies, those with thalamic hemorrhage were more likely to have sinovenous thrombosis than those without thalamic involvement (4/5 vs 5/21, p = 0.03). Term neonates with intraventricular hemorrhage should undergo neuroimaging to evaluate the presence of sinovenous thrombosis. Ann Neurol 2003"
"This study quantitatively explored the dendritic/spine extent of supragranular pyramidal neurons across several cortical areas in two adult male subjects who had undergone a callosotomy several decades before death. In all cortical areas, there were numerous atypical, supragranular pyramidal neurons with elongated ""tap root"" basilar dendrites. These atypical cells could be associated with an underlying epileptic condition and/or could represent a compensatory mechanism in response to deafferentation after callosotomy."
"Inherited succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency (gamma-hydroxybutyric aciduria) is one of the few neurogenetic disorders of GABA metabolism, and one in which tonic-clonic seizures associate with increased central nervous system GABA and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). To explore pathomechanisms and develop new preclinical treatment approaches, we developed a murine knockout model of SSADH deficiency. In the absence of intervention, SSADH(-/-) mice suffer 100% mortality at week 3 to 4 of life from generalized tonic-clonic seizures. In this report, we summarize earlier studies indicating disruption of the GABA/glutamine axis in SSADH(-/-) mouse brain, effective pharmacotherapeutic approaches, preliminary gene-therapy results, and electrophysiological analyses of mutant mice. We also present new evidence for oxidative stress in SSADH(-/-) mice, significant alterations of dopamine metabolism, and abnormal neurosteroid levels in brain, potentially implicating the GABA(A) receptor in pathogenesis. In SSADH deficiency, the accumulation of two neuroactive species, GABA and GHB, is significant because GABA is one of the earliest transmitters expressed in mammals, with key roles in synaptogenesis and myelination, whereas GHB displays a vast array of pharmacological actions. The SSADH(-/-) mouse may represent a useful model in which to explore the effect of GABA and GHB accumulation on central nervous system development and function."
"Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency is a rare disorder characterized by an inborn error of the catabolism of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Because of the deficiency of SSADH, the final enzyme of the GABA degradation pathway, the substrate, succinic semialdehyde, is shunted towards production of 4-hydroxybutyric acid (gamma-hydroxybutyric acid). Elevations of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid can be detected in the physiologic fluids of patients with SSADH deficiency, and forms the mainstay of diagnosis. The clinical features of SSADH deficiency include nonspecific neurologic manifestations such as mental retardation/developmental delay, absent speech, hypotonia, nonprogressive ataxia, features of autism or pervasive developmental delay, developmental language delay (dyspraxia, receptive, and expressive delays), and occasionally, seizures. Although the metabolic pathway has been established, it is not known whether insufficient GABA and/or excess gamma-hydroxybutyric acid contribute to the disease phenotype. Pharmacological therapy in patients with this disorder has been limited to vigabatrin, an anticonvulsant that blocks GABA transaminase. This review will discuss therapeutic options in SSADH deficiency, on the basis of patient experience, and preliminary work using a murine model. Finally, a discussion of adjunctive therapies will be included."
"The investigation of infants and children with suspected pediatric neurotransmitter diseases affecting serotonin and catecholamine metabolism is complicated because the measurement of metabolites in peripheral fluids is generally uninformative. Disorders that affect catecholamine (dopamine and norepinephrine) and serotonin neurotransmission, and that do not present with hyperphenylalaninemia, require that a lumbar puncture be performed and that specific metabolites be assessed in the collected cerebrospinal fluid. This review will discuss the disorders affecting catecholamine and serotonin biosynthesis, sample collection and handling, diagnostic methods and expected profiles, problems with diagnosis, and as yet to be described conditions that might be detected using current diagnostic methodologies."
"We present our approach to the diagnosis of pediatric neurotransmitter diseases exemplified by the differential diagnosis of children presenting with dystonia. This approach is based upon the primary aim of early diagnosis of treatable conditions and the need for a logical series of investigations. We have tried to be comprehensive with our coverage but are aware that ""new"" pediatric neurotransmitter diseases continue to be delineated and that, similarly, a proportion of children presenting with dystonia remain undiagnosed. If this is the case, all of the investigations suggested here may need to be performed regardless of age and presentation. However, of more value is a careful clinical reevaluation."
"Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is a rare disorder of the degradation pathway of gamma-aminobutyric acid. The disorder is detected when 4-hydroxybutyric aciduria is present on urine organic acid analysis, and is subsequently confirmed by enzyme measurement on leucocytes. The disorder has been identified in approximately 350 individuals worldwide. We review the clinical features in 60 patients. The most common characteristics are developmental delay maximally involving expressive language, hypotonia, mental retardation, ataxia, and behavioral problems. Seizures occur in approximately half of patients, and include tonic-clonic, absence, and myoclonic seizures, including status epilepticus. Electroencephalographic findings are background slowing and generalized and focal epileptiform discharges. Magnetic resonance imaging typically reveals increased T2-weighted signal of the globus pallidus bilaterally, with variable involvement of white matter and the cerebellar dentate nucleus. Preliminary human cerebrospinal fluid measurements are consistent with neurometabolic aberrations documented in the murine animal model, with elevations in gamma-aminobutyric acid, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, and homocarnosine, and low glutamine. Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency may be an underrecognized neurometabolic disorder with a nonspecific and wide phenotypic spectrum, and carries implications for a comprehensive fundamental understanding of interrelations between multiple neurotransmitter systems."
"Autosomal dominant guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I (GCH-I) deficiency (Segawa disease) is a dopa-responsive dystonia caused by mutation of the GCH-I gene located on 14q22.1-q22.2. Neurohistochemical examination revealed a decrease of the tyrosine hydroxylase protein as well as its activity in the striatum and decrease of dopamine content, particularly in its ventral portion rich in D1 receptors (striatal direct pathways). Neuroimaging, clinical neurophysiological, and biochemical studies showed preservation of the structure and function of the terminal of the nigrostriatal DA neuron. Clinical neurophysiological studies showed no progressive decrement of DA activities. As the enzymatic activity of pteridine metabolism is highest in the early developmental course, it may modulate dopamine receptors maturing early in the developmental course. Its product, tetrahydrobiopterin, has higher affinity to tyrosine hydroxylase among hydroxylases. Thus, partial deficiency of tetrahydrobiopterin caused by heterozygous mutation of the GCH-I gene decreases dopamine activity rather selectively. This affects the DA receptors that mature early and demonstrates characteristic symptoms age-dependently along with the developmental decrement of the tyrosine hydroxylase activities at the terminals and the maturational processes of the projecting neurons of the basal ganglia. A difference in the ratio of mutant/wild-type GCH-I mRNA that depends on the locus of mutation may explain intrafamilial and interfamilial variation of phenotype."
"In this paper, we provide a brief update of diagnostic considerations and biochemical phenotype in L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency. We review clinical features and outcome data in 11 affected patients, including 7 previously unreported cases. All had onset of the characteristic movement disorder by 6 months of age. The phenomenology of the movement disorder is identical to that previously reported, and includes intermittent oculogyric crises and limb dystonia, generalized athetosis, and impaired voluntary movement in all patients. Autonomic dysfunction is characterized by a significant impairment of sympathetic regulation of heart rate and blood pressure, as documented via detailed studies with spectral analysis techniques in two patients. Functional clinical outcomes as a group remain poor, in spite of a variety of attempted treatment interventions, with marked impairment in motor abilities as well as in speech and communication; however, outcome was quite variable from patient to patient and covered a broad spectrum of neurological disability. Much further work remains to identify and refine the best treatment options for patients with L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency."
"Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the catecholamines dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Recessively inherited deficiency of TH was recently identified and incorporated into recent concepts of genetic dystonias as the cause of recessive Dopa-responsive dystonia or Segawa's syndrome in analogy to dominantly inherited GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency. We report four patients with TH deficiency and two with GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency. Patients with TH deficiency suffer from progressive infantile encephalopathy dominated by motor retardation similar to a primary neuromuscular disorder, fluctuating extrapyramidal, and ocular and vegetative symptoms. Intellectual functions are mostly compromised. Prenatally disturbed brain development and postnatal growth failure were observed. Treatment with levodopa ameliorates but usually does not normalize symptoms. Compared with patients with dominantly inherited GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency, catecholaminergic neurotransmission is severely and constantly impaired in TH deficiency. In most patients, this results not in predominating dystonia, a largely nondegenerative condition, but in a progressive often lethal neurometabolic disorder, which can be improved but not cured by L-dopa. Investigations of neurotransmitter defects by specific cerebrospinal fluid determinations should be included in the diagnostic evaluation of children with progressive infantile encephalopathy."
"Rett's Syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from mutation in the mecp2 gene that encodes methyl CpG binding protein 2, a transcriptional repressor. Because this disease primarily affects neurons, tissue is not available during active disease. We used the olfactory system as a model to investigate abnormalities in neuronal development in RTT, because olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) are replaced throughout life by ongoing postnatal neurogenesis. Thus, even in the adult, the olfactory epithelium contains neurons at various developmental stages. We obtained biopsies of nasal epithelium containing ORNs from RTT patients and age-matched controls to study the status of the neuronal population using antibodies to stage-specific developmental markers. There were no postprocedure complications. Compared with age-matched controls, there were far fewer mature ORNs, as defined by olfactory marker protein expression, and significantly greater numbers of immature neuron-specific tubulin-positive ORNs present. In RTT biopsies, olfactory marker protein-positive neurons displayed abnormal structure. These results suggest that dysfunction of MeCP2 results in decreased survival of mature ORNs with a compensatory increase in neurogenesis, or a failure of immature neurons to mature. Our study indicates that olfactory biopsies provide a method to study neuronal developmental diseases in adults and children."
"The ketogenic diet (KD), a treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy, elevates brain acetone. Acetone has been shown to suppress experimental seizures. Whether elevation of acetone is the basis of the anticonvulsant effects of the KD and whether acetone, like the KD, antagonizes many different types of seizures, however, is unknown. This study investigated the spectrum of the anticonvulsant effects of acetone in animal seizure models. Rats were injected with acetone intraperitoneally. Dose-response effects were measured in four different models: (1) the maximal electroshock test, which models human tonic-clonic seizures; (2) the subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole test, which models human typical absence seizures; (3) the amygdala kindling test, which models human complex partial seizures with secondary generalization; and (4) the AY-9944 test, which models chronic atypical absence seizures, a component of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Acetone suppressed seizures in all of the models, with the following ED(50)'s (expressed in mmol/kg): maximal electroshock, 6.6; pentylenetetrazole, 9.7; generalized kindled seizures, 13.1; focal kindled seizures, 26.5; AY-9944, 4.0. Acetone appears to have a broad spectrum of anticonvulsant effects. These effects parallel the effects of the KD. Elevation of brain acetone therefore may account for the efficacy of the KD in intractable epilepsy."
"We previously have identified a large kindred from Colombia in which Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by the E280A presenilin 1 (PS1) mutation. The objective of this study was to examine whether environmental and genetic factors are responsible for variation in the phenotypic expression of the E280A PS1 mutation. We genotyped coding and promoter polymorphisms of the APOE gene in carriers of the E280A PS1 mutation. Kaplan-Meier product-limit and Cox proportional hazard models were used in the statistical analyses. DNA was available from 114 carriers of the E280A PS1 mutation, including 52 subjects with AD. APOE epsilon 4 allele carriers were more likely to develop AD at an earlier age than subjects without the epsilon 4 allele (hazard ratio, 2.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-3.99; p = 0.030). Subjects with low education were more likely to develop AD later than those with higher education (hazard ratio, 0.476; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.87). Low educational level was associated with rural residence (p &lt; 0.001). Promoter APOE variants did not influence either the onset or the duration of the disease. This study is the first to our knowledge to demonstrate that genetic and environmental factors influence age of onset in a kindred with a familial AD mutation."
"Benign hereditary chorea is an autosomal dominant disorder presenting with childhood-onset chorea, no dementia, and little or no progression. We present a family with typical clinical features of benign hereditary chorea. Pathological investigation of the brain of an affected family member who died of an unrelated condition showed no significant gross or histological abnormalities. Genetic evaluation showed a novel single nucleotide substitution of intron 2 of the TITF-1 gene (also referred to as TTF, NKX2.1, and T/ebp) on chromosome 14 which is predicted to have drastic consequences on the maturation processes of TITF-1."
"Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) maintains survival of adult motor neurons. Mice lacking the CNTF gene develop mild, progressive motor neuron loss. In the normal human population, 1 to 2.3% are homozygous for a null allele, and reports suggest this mutant is associated with a younger onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We have tested this hypothesis in a study of 400 subjects with ALS and 236 controls. There was no difference in age of onset, clinical presentation, rate of progression, or disease duration for those with one or two copies of the null allele, excluding CNTF as a major disease modifier in ALS."
"The hypothesis that blockade of muscarinic receptors is associated with increased Alzheimer-type pathology was investigated in Parkinson's disease. Amyloid plaque densities were more than 2.5-fold higher in cases treated with antimuscarinic medication in the long term compared with untreated or short-term treated cases (p = 0.005 and 0.00005, respectively). Neurofibrillary tangle densities were also highest in chronic compared with untreated or acute-treated groups (p = 0.02 and 0.05, respectively). The findings, if replicated, have potential implications for the use of anticholinergic medication in elderly Parkinson's disease patients."
"The purpose of this study was to better understand the frequency and mechanisms of stroke recurrence after the stroke with no determined cause (NC). We prospectively studied consecutive patients with acute cerebral infarcts. We divided the patients into five groups (large artery disease [LAD], cardioembolism [CE], small artery disease [SAD], two or more causes [TMC], and NC) and registered recurrent strokes and prognosis for 1 year. Those in the NC group were compared with other subtypes. A total of 204 patients were included; 56 LAD, 22 CE, 62 SAD, 27 TMC, and 37 NC. During follow-up, there were 7 deaths and 31 first recurrent strokes. Patients of the NC group showed a significantly higher rate (30%) of recurrent stroke than those of other subtypes (LAD 16%; CE 14%; SAD 2%), and it was associated with the existence of mild stenosis (&lt;/=50%) on relevant artery or the stenosis of greater than 50% on nonrelevant artery. Occlusive lesions other than significant stenosis of relevant artery may play an important role in the development of stroke recurrence in patients of the NC group. Therefore, from the therapeutic and prognostic point of view, the detection of such occlusive lesions in patients with cryptogenic stroke may be needed."
"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) is the most common neurological complication of HIV infection. Currently, the pathogenesis of HIV-SN is unknown. Because there is no convincing evidence of neuronal infection, HIV neurotoxicity is likely to be effected either by secreted viral proteins such as the envelope glycoprotein gp120 or by neurotoxic cytokines released from infected/activated glial cells. We describe a model of gp120 toxicity to primary sensory neurons, in which gp120 induces neuritic degeneration and neuronal apoptosis. We show that Schwann cells, the cells that ensheath peripheral nerve axons, and which traditionally have been viewed as having a passive, supporting role, mediate this neurotoxicity. Ligation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 on Schwann cells by gp120 resulted in the release of RANTES, which induced dorsal root ganglion neurons to produce tumor necrosis factor-alpha and subsequent TNFR1-mediated neurotoxicity in an autocrine fashion. This newly described Schwann cell-neuron interaction may be pathogenically relevant not only in HIV-SN but also in other peripheral neuropathies."
"We hypothesized that it would be possible to detect the distribution of cortical activation by using a sensitive, rapid, high-resolution infrared imaging technique to monitor changes in local cerebral blood flow induced by changes in focal cortical metabolism. In a prospective study, we recorded in 21 patients the emission of infrared radiation from the exposed human cerebral cortex at baseline, during language and motor tasks, and during stimulation of the contralateral median nerve using an infrared camera (sensitivity 0.02 degrees C). The language and sensorimotor cortex was identified by standard mapping methods (cortical stimulation, median nerve somatosensory-evoked potential, functional magnetic resonance imaging), which were compared with infrared functional localization. The temperature gradients measured during surgery are dominated by changes in local cerebral blood flow associated with evoked functional activation. The distribution of the evoked temperature changes overlaps with, but extends beyond, functional regions identified by standard mapping techniques. The distribution observed via infrared mapping is consistent with distributed and complex functional representation of the cerebral cortex, rather than the traditional concept of discrete functional loci demonstrated by brief cortical stimulation during surgery and by noninvasive functional imaging techniques. By providing information on the spatial and temporal patterns of sensory-motor and language representation, infrared imaging may prove to be a useful approach to study brain function."
"We report a Belgian family with autosomal dominant, late-onset, distal myopathy with selective foot extensor muscle involvement of the lower legs. Linkage to the tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD) locus 2q31 was not evident at first because of incomplete disease penetrance in a 50-year-old asymptomatic family member. An abnormal tibialis anterior muscle biopsy established her subclinical status and linkage of the family to the TMD locus. Mutation analysis showed a disease-specific, heterozygous point mutation in the last exon, Mex6, of the titin gene. This is the third mutation found in TMD and the second European family with TMD outside the Finnish population, suggesting that titinopathies may occur in various populations."
"Excessive astrocytosis in cortical tubers in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) suggests that astrocytes may be important for epileptogenesis in TSC. We previously demonstrated that astrocyte-specific Tsc1 gene inactivation in mice (Tsc1 cKO mice) results in progressive epilepsy. Here, we report that glutamate transporter expression and function is impaired in Tsc1 cKO astrocytes. Tsc1 cKO mice exhibit decreased GLT-1 and GLAST protein expression. Electrophysiological assays demonstrate a functional decrease in glutamate transport currents of Tsc1 cKO astrocytes in hippocampal slices and astrocyte cultures. These findings suggest that Tsc1 inactivation in astrocytes causes dysfunctional glutamate homeostasis, leading to seizure development in TSC."
"Recently, exclusive loss of paternal 19q alleles in six of six oligodendrogliomas has been reported, indicating that parental imprinting plays a role in these tumors. We examined a series of 10 oligodendrogliomas and 3 oligoastrocytomas with allelic losses on 1p and 19q for the parental origin of the lost alleles. Ten cases lost paternal 1p alleles and 3 cases lost maternal alleles. For 19q, six cases had loss of paternal alleles and seven cases of had loss of maternal alleles. These random distributions do not support the hypothesis that parental imprinting accounts for inactivation of the putative oligodendroglioma tumor suppressor genes."
"Gene therapy methods have continued to develop rapidly, and many initial limitations that hampered clinical application have been overcome. Thus serious consideration of clinical application of gene therapy is warranted for selected disorders in which the pathogenesis is well defined. Parkinson's disease has been the most extensively studied target of gene therapy for central nervous system disorders and shares many features with pediatric neurotransmitter diseases. Neurotransmitter replacement therapy using catecholamine-synthesizing genes and delivery of neurotrophic factors such as glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factors has been successful in animal models of Parkinson's disease. Application of gene therapy for pediatric neurotransmitter diseases will require delineating the optimal set of genes to correct the consequences of the deficiencies. The optimal anatomical targets and proper timing of the gene replacement must be understood. Safety of gene therapy vehicles and the ability to regulate gene expression will be essential for eventual clinical application."
"The dopamine system is implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Genetic mutations or variations that affect dopamine system functions either directly cause or contribute to these disorders, even though other genetic and environmental factors may contribute significantly to some of these disorders as well. Transgenic mice increasingly become important tools in revealing functions of genes that are essential components of the dopamine system as well as in modeling human genetic disorders. We have reviewed a comprehensive list of those genes and compared genetic mutations/variations in humans and transgenic mouse models. The significance and limitations of these animal models as well as future directions are discussed."
"Recovery of speech after infarction of the left pars opercularis (POp) may be due to recruitment of homotopic cortex in the right hemisphere. Using positron emission tomography, we investigated activity within left and right POp during everyday propositional speech. We studied seven aphasic patients with left anterior perisylvian infarction which included the POp. We compared their data with two control groups: 12 normal subjects and 7 anterior aphasic patients whose infarcts spared the left POp. During propositional speech, normal subjects activated the left POp, left posterior perisylvian cortex, and a distributed, predominantly left-lateralized, extrasylvian neural network. Importantly, activity in the right POp was reduced relative to a baseline nonspeech condition. In patients with infarction of the left POp, activity in the right POp was reversed: speech activated the right POp above baseline. Patient controls activated the left POp but did not show the normal relative reduction in activity in the right POp. In both patient groups, posterior perisylvian and extrasylvian activations remained unchanged from normal. This result demonstrates that infarction of the left POp is associated with a chronic change in function of the contralateral homotopic cortex during speech."
"During the first few hours after onset, stroke symptoms may evolve rapidly. We studied the correlation between brain perfusion and aphasia changes during the hyperacute phase of stroke using a new technique of perfusion computed tomography (P-CT). Using an aphasia score developed for each language modality, language was evaluated within 6 hours after onset, then sequentially during the first week. Maps of the penumbra and infarct obtained from P-CT images and definite infarct size evaluated using T2 and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) on day 3 were rated by a neuroradiologist, blinded to the clinical deficit. Within 6 hours, deficits in all language modalities were present in 13 out of 24 consecutive patients, corresponding to large anterior-posterior perfusion deficits of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. The aphasia score correlated with a corresponding perfusion deficit in specific areas of the MCA territory, and showed significantly less improvement when the penumbra evolved toward infarction than when at least part of the penumbra was rescued. Our findings suggest a particularly good correlation between the evolution of aphasic symptoms and penumbra dynamics. Further studies on the relevance of penumbra dynamics in function-specific brain areas to decision taking in hyperacute stroke management are required."
"Azulenyl nitrones are novel chain-breaking antioxidants with low oxidation potentials and high lipophilicity-properties favoring their efficacy as neuroprotectants. We tested the second-generation azulenyl nitrone, stilbazunenlyl nitrone (STAZN), in focal ischemic stroke. Physiologically monitored rats received 2 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion by intraluminal suture, resulting in substantial cortical and striatal infarcation. Neurobehavior was quantified on a standard battery, and brains were perfusion-fixed for quantitative histopathology at 3 days. In 3 independent series, rats were treated at either 2h + 4h, or 2h + 4h + 24h + 48h, after onset of ischemia; vehicle-treated rats received dimethylsulfoxide or saline. All animals (n = 52) developed high-grade neurological deficits (score 11 of 12) during ischemia, which improved, in STAZN-treated rats, within 1-1.5 h of the initial dose and fell to a median score of 3 at 72 h, compared to 8 in vehicle rats. STAZN treatment reduced mean cortical infarct volume by 64-97%, and total infarct volume by 42-72%. In over one-half of STAZN-treated animals, cortical infarction was virtually abolished. Regression analysis predicted that STAZN would confer approximately 50% cortical neuroprotection even in the most severely affected cases. The potency of STAZN was orders-of-magnitude greater than other nitrones such as NXY-059. These results suggest that STAZN has great promise for ischemic stroke."
"We report an autopsied case of a 21-gestational-week fetus with duplication of the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene (PLP1). An immunohistochemical study, which can detect the specific expression of PLP, myelin basic protein, myelin-associated glycoprotein, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha subunit in brain tissues, showed that the myelination was almost the same as that of age-matched controls. This result suggests that the development and migration of the oligodendrocyte is normal in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease until midgestation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the myelination of a fetus with duplication of the PLP1 gene."
"Decreased levels of beta-amyloid peptide 1-42 (Abeta1-42) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are a characteristic feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) but recently were also observed in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). We analyzed the CSF of patients with CJD, and AD and nondemented controls using a quantitative urea-based Abeta sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis immunoblot. Like in AD and nondemented controls, we found a highly conserved pattern of carboxyterminally truncated Abeta1-37/38/39 in addition to Abeta1-40/42 also in CJD patients. By the introduction of the ratio Abeta1-39 to Abeta1-42, CJD and AD can effectively be differentiated. We conclude that the immunoblot shows disease-specific CSF Abeta peptide patterns in CJD and AD and suppose that measurement of the Abeta peptide pattern seems to be a promising diagnostic tool in the differential diagnosis of dementias."
"We evaluated the association of HSV-1, HHV-6, and VZV with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Brain specimens for viral DNA polymerase chain reaction represented 34 patients with AD, 40 with PD, and 40 controls. One AD patient (2.9%) was positive for HSV-1 DNA, 88.2% for HHV-6 DNA, and 26.5% for VZV DNA; 17.5% of PD patients were HSV-1 DNA-positive and 75% HHV-6-positive, whereas 40% had VZV DNA. Twenty-five percent of the controls were positive for HSV-1 DNA, 87.5% for HHV-6, and 27.5% for VZV. HSV-1, VZV, or HHV-6 DNA in brains was no additional risk factor for AD."
"Mutations in DJ-1 have been linked to an autosomal recessive form of early-onset parkinsonism. To identify mutations causing Parkinson's disease (PD), we sequenced exons 1 through 7 of DJ-1 in 107 early-onset (age at diagnosis up to 50 years) PD subjects. One subject had a frameshift mutation in the first coding exon and an exon 7 splice mutation both predicted to result in a loss of functional protein. This subject was diagnosed with probable PD at age 24 years with asymmetric onset and an excellent response to levodopa therapy. Our observations suggest that sequence alterations in DJ-1 are a rare cause of early-onset PD."
"This report describes, for what may be only the second time, a ruptured miliary aneurysm within a cerebral hemorrhage. The report is unique in that the aneurysm has arisen at the site of a dissection within the wall of an arteriole at a site of fibrinoid necrosis. The case not only is a unique illustration of this pathogenetic pathway to miliary aneurysm formation, but also reemphasizes the relationship between fibrinoid and miliary aneurysm formation."
"The neural basis of the amnesia characterizing early Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains uncertain. Postmortem pathological studies have suggested early involvement of the mesial temporal lobe, whereas in vivo metabolic studies have shown hypometabolism of the posterior cingulate cortex. Using a technique that combined the anatomic precision of magnetic resonance imaging with positron emission tomography, we found severe reductions of metabolism throughout a network of limbic structures (the hippocampal complex, medial thalamus, mamillary bodies, and posterior cingulate) in patients with mild AD. We then studied a cohort with mild cognitive impairment in whom amnesia was the only cognitive abnormality and found comparable hypometabolism through the same network. The AD and mild cognitive impairment groups were differentiated, however, by changes outside this network, the former showing significant hypometabolism in amygdala and temporoparietal and frontal association cortex, whereas the latter did not. The amnesia of very early AD reflects severe but localized limbic dysfunction."
"We examined the potential role of the extra-cellular matrix-degrading enzyme, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), in the pathogenesis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)-induced spontaneous hemorrhage. The amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) induced the synthesis, release and activation of MMP-9 in murine cerebral endothelial cells, resulting in increased extracellular matrix degradation. Furthermore, extensive MMP-9 immunoreactivity was observed in CAA-vessels with evidence of microhemorrhage in aged APPsw transgenic mice, but not detected in aged wild type or young APPsw mice. These results suggest that increased vascular MMP-9 expression, stimulated by Abeta, may play a role in the pathogenesis of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in patients with CAA."
"Neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) may provide dopaminergic neurons for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, transplantation of NPCs into the striatum by current methods has had limited success. It is possible to reverse the symptoms of PD in model rats but difficult to reverse them in humans because the number of dopaminergic neurons generated from NPCs is low. We transduced the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene into NPCs isolated from embryonic rat brain. The NPCs with the transduced VHL gene efficiently differentiated into tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in vitro. NPCs with the transduced VHL gene, which were labeled in advance with bromodeoxyuridine, were transplanted into the striatum of a rat model of PD. Numerous bromodeoxyuridine-tyrosine hydroxylase double-labeled cells were seen close to the transplant site, showing that the transplanted cells efficiently generated new dopaminergic neurons within the host striatum. Moreover, all of the animals with NPCs with VHL showed a remarkable decrease in apomorphine-induced rotations. These findings show that NPCs with the VHL gene can efficiently generate dopaminergic neurons and that a sufficient number of dopaminergic neurons can develop from them to reverse the symptoms of PD in humans. VHL gene transduction provides a new therapeutic approach for treatment of PD."
"A cornerstone of mitochondrial genetics, strict maternal inheritance, has been challenged recently by the study of a patient with mitochondrial myopathy due to a sporadic 2bp deletion. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) harboring the mutation was paternal in origin, whereas the patient's blood was identical to the maternal genotype. To determine whether this is a common phenomenon, we studied mtDNA sequence variation between muscle and blood from 35 patients with sporadic mitochondrial myopathies, but detected no evidence of paternal mtDNA transmission. Our findings suggest that paternal transmission of mtDNA is rare and should not alter our genetic advice to families."
"Mutations in DJ-1 (PARK7) have been reported in two consanguineous families with young-onset Parkinson's disease (YOPD). This study aims to confirm the presence of pathogenic DJ-1 mutations and determine their contribution in young-onset and more typical later onset Parkinson's disease (PD). The entire open reading frame of the DJ-1 gene was screened by direct sequencing in 185 unrelated YOPD patients and a separate cohort of 190 pathologically proven cases of PD. Ethnically matched controls were screened for all mutations identified. We report a low frequency of pathogenic DJ-1 mutations in our cohort of patients. One homozygous missense mutation and one heterozygous mutation were found in two YOPD samples. In addition, several variants were found in the coding sequence of the gene, which are likely to represent polymorphisms. In one case, the polymorphism was population specific. The reported 14Kbp deletion was not found in any of our samples or controls. We confirm the presence of pathogenic DJ-1 mutations in YOPD and estimate their frequency at approximately 1%. No mutations were found in our cohort of later onset sporadic pathologically confirmed cases, suggesting that DJ-1 mutations may only rarely contribute to the cause of this more typical sporadic form of the disease."
"Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of neurodegenerative disorders clinically characterized by late-onset ataxia and variable other manifestations. Genetically and clinically, SCA is highly heterogeneous. Recently, CAG repeat expansions in the gene encoding TATA-binding protein (TBP) have been found in a new form of SCA, which has been designated SCA17. To estimate the frequency of SCA17 among white SCA patients and to define the phenotypic variability, we determined the frequency of SCA17 in a large sample of 1,318 SCA patients. In total, 15 patients in four autosomal dominant SCA families had CAG/CAA repeat expansions in the TBP gene ranging from 45 to 54 repeats. The clinical features of our SCA17 patients differ from other SCA types by manifesting with psychiatric abnormalities and dementia. The neuropathology of SCA17 can be classified as a ""pure cerebellar"" or ""cerebello-olivary"" form of ataxia. However, intranuclear neuronal inclusion bodies with immunoreactivity to anti-TBP and antipolyglutamine were much more widely distributed throughout the brain gray matter than in other SCAs. Based on clinical and genetic data, we conclude that SCA17 is rare among white SCA patients. SCA17 should be considered in sporadic and familial cases of ataxia with accompanying psychiatric symptoms and dementia."
"Women with Down's syndrome experience early onset of both menopause and Alzheimer's disease. This timing provides an opportunity to examine the influence of endogenous estrogen deficiency, indicated by age at menopause, on risk of Alzheimer's disease. A community-based sample of 163 postmenopausal women with Down's syndrome, 40 to 60 years of age, was ascertained through the New York State Developmental Disability service system. Information from cognitive assessments, medical record review, neurological evaluation, and caregiver interviews was used to establish ages for onset of menopause and dementia. We used survival and multivariate regression analyses to determine the relation of age at menopause to age at onset of Alzheimer's disease, adjusting for age, level of mental retardation, body mass index, and history of hypothyroidism or depression. Women with early onset of menopause (46 years or younger) had earlier onset and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared with women with onset of menopause after 46 years (rate ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-5.9). Demented women had higher mean serum sex hormone binding globulin levels than nondemented women (86.4 vs 56.6 nmol/L, p = 0.02), but similar levels of total estradiol, suggesting that bioavailable estradiol, rather than total estradiol, is associated with dementia. Our findings support the hypothesis that reductions in estrogens after menopause contribute to the cascade of pathological processes leading to AD."
"Given the high short-term risk of stroke after transient ischemic attack, we hypothesized that substantial acute neurological recovery in patients presenting with cerebral ischemia would be associated with a greater risk of subsequent neurological deterioration due to recurrent cerebral ischemia. Data from the Trial of ORG10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment, a randomized trial of the heparinoid danaparoid, were analyzed to determine whether substantial acute recovery, defined as an improvement of greater than or equal to 75% on National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) between baseline and 24 hours, was associated with a greater risk of subsequent deterioration, defined as a worsening on the NIHSS between day 1 and day 90. Of 1,184 subjects meeting entry criteria, 63 (5.3%) had substantial acute recovery. Subsequent deterioration was more common in those with substantial acute recovery compared with others (48 vs 33%; p = 0.028 by Fisher's exact test). In multivariable models, substantial acute recovery remained an independent predictor of subsequent deterioration (odds ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-5.2; p &lt; 0.001). Among patients with acute cerebral ischemia, those who recover substantially within 24 hours may be at greater risk of subsequent neurological deterioration due to causes other than hemorrhage."
"Macrophages are thought to represent a first line of defense in anti-tumor immunity. Despite infiltration by microglial cells, however, malignant gliomas are still highly aggressive tumors. We here identify monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) as a critical chemoattractant for glioma-infiltrating microglial cells. MCP-1-transfected rat CNS-1 gliomas were massively infiltrated by microglial cells. Whereas MCP-1 did not promote the growth of CNS-1 cells in vitro, intracerebral CNS-1-transfected tumors grew more aggressively than control-transfected tumors. This provides the first functional evidence that MCP-1 recruits microglial cells to gliomas and promotes their growth in vivo. Microglial cells may support rather than suppress glioma growth."
"We investigated the cleavage of caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis, in the medial temporal lobe of older subjects with minimal cognitive deficits and low CERAD/intermediate Braak scores, that is, clinicopathological descriptors of early Alzheimer's disease (AD). The activation of caspase-3 was studied with immunoprecipitation-mass spectroscopy and immunocytochemistry, including colocalization with paired helical filaments in the neuropil and perikarya. We found that caspase-3 is activated in the parahippocampal gyrus in subjects with mild AD and that this event is silenced in more advanced illness. Caspase-3 immunoreactivity has a tangle-like appearance that coevolves with paired helical filament pathology within neurons. We propose that activation of apoptosis may occur very early in the medial temporal lobe in AD."
"We report a case of congenital hypomyelination associated with cranial nerve dysfunction, respiratory failure, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy confounding the clinical picture. Molecular genetic testing showed a complex de novo myelin protein zero (MPZ) mutation consisting of a 3bp deletion of CTA from nucleotide 550 to 552 and insertion of G at nucleotide 550 that by conceptual translation results in a frameshift mutation. Muscle biopsy findings are presented that allude to the effect of abnormal innervation on early postnatal muscle differentiation."
"We report the molecular findings in two independent patients presenting with progressive generalized dystonia and bilateral striatal necrosis in whom we have identified a mutation (T14487C) in the mitochondrial ND6 gene. The mutation is heteroplasmic in all samples analyzed, and it fulfills all accepted criteria of pathogenicity. Transmitochondrial cell lines harboring 100% mutant mitochondrial DNA showed a marked decrease in the activity of complex I of the respiratory chain supporting the pathogenic role of T14487C."
"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has become an effective strategy in the treatment of motor symptoms in advanced Parkinson's disease. However, clinical studies have shown that DBS can affect verbal fluency. Seven Parkinson's disease patients with bilateral DBS of the STN were studied with positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate the effects of STN stimulation on regional cerebral blood flow during a verbal fluency task. Activation of the right orbitofrontal cortex and verbal fluency-associated activation within a left-sided frontotemporal network were decreased during STN stimulation compared with the OFF state. Our results offer an explanation for the commonest neuropsychological side effect of STN stimulation and show that STN stimulation affects a frontotemporal network during a fluency task."
"Hearing loss is the most frequent long-term complication of pneumococcal meningitis, affecting up to 40% of survivors. Unfortunately, adjuvant therapy with dexamethasone has failed to satisfactorily reduce its incidence. Therefore, we evaluated the use of antioxidants for the adjunctive therapy of meningitis-associated deafness. Eighteen hours after intracisternal injection of 7.5 x 10(5) colony-forming units of Streptococcus pneumoniae, rats were treated systemically either with ceftriaxone and the antioxidants and peroxynitrite scavengers Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)-porphyrin (MnTBAP) or N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or placebo (1 ml phosphate-buffered saline) for 4 days. Hearing was assessed by auditory brainstem response audiometry. Adjunctive antioxidant therapy significantly reduced the long-term hearing loss (14 days after infection) for square wave impulses (mean hearing loss +/- SD: ceftriaxone and placebo, 45+/-26 dB; ceftriaxone and MnTBAP, 9+/-23 dB; ceftriaxone and NAC, 19+/-30 dB) as well as 1 kHz (ceftriaxone and placebo, 28+/-19 dB; ceftriaxone and MnTBAP, 10+/-16 dB; ceftriaxone and NAC, 10+/-17 dB), and 10 kHz tone bursts (ceftriaxone and placebo, 62+/-27 dB; ceftriaxone and MnTBAP, 16+/-13 dB; ceftriaxone and NAC, 25+/-26 dB). Furthermore, both antioxidants attenuated the morphological correlates of meningogenic hearing loss, namely, long-term blood-labyrinth barrier disruption, spiral ganglion neuronal loss, and fibrous obliteration of the perilymphatic spaces. Adjuvant antioxidant therapy is highly otoprotective in meningitis and therefore is a promising future treatment option."
"Limited analyses of cerebrospinal fluid from patients with central nervous system infections have shown that the oligoclonal IgG is antibody directed against the agent that causes disease. Using a new method involving binding of IgG to beads coated with lysates prepared from candidate infectious antigens, we showed that the oligoclonal IgG in cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with chronic varicella zoster virus vasculopathy is directed against the causative virus. This approach holds promise in identifying and purifying the relevant oligoclonal IgGs in inflammatory central nervous system diseases of unknown cause."
"It has been proposed that the intact (ipsilateral) motor cortex play a significant role mediating recovery of motor function in the paretic hand of chronic stroke patients, but this hypothesis has not been tested experimentally. Here, we evaluated the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on motor performance of the paretic hand of chronic stroke patients and healthy controls. We hypothesized that, if activity in the intact hemisphere contributes to functional recovery, TMS should result in abnormal motor behavior in the paretic hand. We found that stimulation of the intact hemisphere resulted in delayed simple reaction times (RTs) in the contralateral healthy but not in the ipsilateral paretic hand, whereas stimulation of the lesioned hemisphere led to a marked delay in RT in the contralateral paretic hand but not in the ipsilateral healthy hand. RT delays in the paretic hand correlated well with functional recovery. Finger tapping in the paretic hand was affected by TMS of the lesioned but not the intact hemisphere. These results are consistent with the idea that recovered motor function in the paretic hand of chronic stroke patients relies predominantly on reorganized activity within motor areas of the affected hemisphere."
"Respiratory chain complex I deficiency is a common cause of Leigh's disease (LD) and can be caused by mutations in genes encoded by either nuclear or mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Most pathogenic mtDNA mutations act recessively and only cause disease when present at high mutant loads (typically &gt;90%) in tissues such as muscle and brain. Two mitochondrial DNA mutations in complex I subunit genes, G14459A in ND6, and T12706C in ND5, have been associated with complex I deficiency and LD. We report another ND5 mutation, G13513A, in three unrelated patients with complex I deficiency and LD. The G13513A mutation was present at mutant loads of approximately 50% or less in all tissues tested, including multiple brain regions. The threshold mutant load for causing a complex I defect in cultured cells was approximately 30%. Blue Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that fibroblasts with 45% G13513A mutant load had approximately 50% of the normal amount of fully assembled complex I. Fibroblasts with greater than 97% of the ND6 G14459A mutation had only 20% fully assembled complex I, suggesting that both mutations disrupt complex I assembly or turnover. We conclude that the G13513A mutation causes a complex I defect when present at unusually low mutant load and may act dominantly."
"In a prospective phase I/II clinical study, we treated eight patients suffering from recurrent glioblastoma multiform with stereotactically guided intratumoral convection-enhanced delivery of an HSV-1-tk gene-bearing liposomal vector and systemic ganciclovir. Noninvasive identification of target tissue together with assessment of vector-distribution volume and the effects of gene therapy were achieved using magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. The treatment was tolerated well without major side effects. In two of eight patients, we observed a greater than 50% reduction of tumor volume and in six of eight patients focal treatment effects. Intracerebral infusion of contrast medium before vector application displayed substantial inhomogeneity of tissue staining indicating the need of test infusions to monitor the mechanical distribution of vectors. Visualization of therapeutic effects on tumor metabolism and documentation of gene expression using positron emission tomography indicated that molecular imaging technology appears to be essential for the further development of biological treatment strategies."
"Subjects were followed in the Longitudinal Core Study of the Baltimore Huntington's Disease Center and given annual neurological, cognitive, and psychiatric examinations. Postmortem neuropathological grade was assigned using the system of Vonsattel and colleagues. We examined the correlations between the neuropathological grade and scores on the Quantified Neurological Examination (QNE) and its chorea and motor impairment subscales, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the HD Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Scale, and a number of demographic variables (CAG number, age of onset, age at death, disease duration) in 100 subjects who had been examined within 1,000 days of death. All measures showed significant correlation with Vonsattel score except for chorea. The strongest effect was that of motor impairment score (r(2) = 0.351, p &lt; 0.0001). In a stepwise correlation of clinical variables, motor impairment remained significant. The largest effect for a demographic variable was for age of onset (r(2) = 0.226, p &lt; 0.0001) A partial correlation was significant between CAG number and Vonsattel grade, controlling for age at death or disease duration. Motor impairment appears to be a good clinical measure of neuronal cell loss, at least late in the course of HD and therefore may prove useful in observational and treatment studies."
"It remains unclear whether uncontrolled epilepsy causes mental decline. This longitudinal study contrasts change of memory and nonmemory functions in 147 surgically and 102 medically treated patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. All participants were evaluated at baseline (T1) and after 2 to 10 years (T3). Surgical patients underwent additional testing 1 year postoperatively (T2). Data were analyzed on an individual and group level. Sixty-three percent of the surgical and 12% of the medically treated patients were seizure-free at T3. Fifty percent of the medically treated and 60% of the surgical patients showed significant memory decline at T3 with little change in nonmemory functions (difference not significant). Surgery anticipated the decline seen in the medically treated group and exceeded it when surgery was performed on the left, or if seizures continued postoperatively. Seizure-free surgical patients showed recovery of nonmemory functions at T2 (p &lt; 0.001) and of memory functions at T3 (T3, p = 0.03). Multiple regression indicated retest interval, seizure control, and mental reserve capacity as predictors of performance changes. In addition, psychosocial outcome was better when seizures were controlled. In conclusion, chronic temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with progressive memory impairment. Surgery, particularly if unsuccessful, accelerates this decline. However, memory decline may be stopped and even reversed if seizures are fully controlled."
"Myosin constitutes the major part of the thick filaments in the contractile apparatus of striated muscle. MYH7 encodes the slow/beta-cardiac myosin heavy chain (MyHC), which is the main MyHC isoform in slow, oxidative, type 1 muscle fibers of skeletal muscle. It is also the major MyHC isoform of cardiac ventricles. Numerous missense mutations in the globular head of slow/beta-cardiac MyHC are associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We identified a missense mutation, Arg1845Trp, in the rod region of slow/beta-cardiac MyHC in patients with a skeletal myopathy from two different families. The myopathy was characterized by muscle weakness and wasting with onset in childhood and slow progression, but no overt cardiomyopathy. Slow, oxidative, type 1 muscle fibers showed large inclusions consisting of slow/beta-cardiac MyHC. The features were similar to a previously described entity: hyaline body myopathy. Our findings indicate that the mutated residue of slow/beta-cardiac MyHC is essential for the assembly of thick filaments in skeletal muscle. We propose the term myosin storage myopathy for this disease."
"The interrelationship of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), hippocampal sclerosis, and febrile convulsions still remains an enigma. Additional microscopical cortical dysplasia or microdysgenesis has been suggested as pre-existent susceptibility factor rendering the affected brain vulnerable to the development of MTLE after initial precipitating injuries such as febrile convulsions. Twenty-four MTLE cases with histopathologically definite hippocampal sclerosis were examined for clearly defined features of microdysgenesis and further signs of neocortical dysplasia. Although unequivocal signs of dysplasia were absent, 29.2% of cases showed cortical neuronal clustering, 25.0% showed perivascular clustering, and 20.8% showed increased white matter neurons. The features of microdysgenesis studied here were not linked with each other and were not related to initial precipitating injuries, positive family history, or any other clinical parameter. Their suggested fundamental role as dysplastic factor within development of hippocampal sclerosis and MTLE is not confirmed."
"Dominantly inherited guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-cyclohydrolase deficiency, otherwise known as Segawa's disease or dopa-responsive dystonia, has a wide spectrum of phenotypic expression ranging from asymptomatic to very severe. Penetrance is more frequent in women as compared with men, and there is a variable occurrence of diurnal variation in symptom intensity. Biochemical characterization of the disease has demonstrated lower cerebrospinal fluid levels of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), neopterin, and homovanillic acid and low levels of tyrosine hydroxylase protein in the striatum. To investigate the pathophysiology, we have begun to characterize biogenic amine and BH4 metabolism in the GTP cyclohydrolase deficient hph-1 mouse. The data show low brain levels of BH4, catecholamines, serotonin, and their metabolites together with low levels of tyrosine hydroxylase protein within the striatum. The hph-1 mouse therefore provides a good model system in which to study the human disease."
"gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. GABA is converted from glutamic acid by the action of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) of which two isoforms exist GAD65 and GAD67. GABA then is broken down, both within the cell and in the synaptic cleft by GABA transaminase to form succinic semialdehyde. In turn, succinic semialdehyde is converted either to succinic acid by succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase or into gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) by succinic semialdehyde reductase. Because GABA modulates the majority of inhibition that is ongoing in the brain, perturbations in GABAergic inhibition have the potential to result in seizures. Therefore, the most common disorder in which GABA is targeted as a treatment is epilepsy. However, other disorders such as psychiatric disease, spasticity, and stiff-person syndrome all have been related to disorders of GABAergic function in the brain. This review covers the roles of GABAergic neurotransmission in epilepsy, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, stiff-person syndrome, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. In the final section of this review, the GABA metabolite GHB is discussed in terms of its physiological significance and its role in epilepsy, sleep disorders, drug and alcohol addiction, and an inborn error of GABA metabolism, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency."
"Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a noninvasive method that permits measurement of the concentration of specific biochemical compounds in the brain and other organ systems in precisely defined regions guided by MR imaging (MRI). Recently, MRS methods have been developed to measure specific neurotransmitters in the brain. More advanced MRS methods have been developed to measure the synthesis rates and turnover of specific neurotransmitters. These turnover rates can provide measures of brain metabolism similar to radioisotope techniques. Also, investigations of the relationship of brain metabolism and specific neurotransmitter systems are now possible using MRS. Here, we review the MRS techniques and studies of neurotransmitters in the human brain. A discussion of the potential use of these techniques in the context of certain pediatric neurotransmitter disorders will be presented."
"In 2002, paternal inheritance of muscle mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was reported in a patient with exercise intolerance and a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation restricted to skeletal muscle. To evaluate whether paternal inheritance is a common phenomenon, we studied 10 sporadic patients with skeletal muscle-restricted mtDNA mutations: five harbored mtDNA point mutations in protein-coding genes and five had single mtDNA deletions. We performed haplotype analysis and direct sequencing of the hypervariable regions 1 and 2 of the D-loop in muscle and blood from the patients and, when available, in blood from their parents. We did not observe paternal inheritance in any of our patients."
"The role of heredity in early- versus late-onset Parkinson's disease (PD) is controversial. We estimated the degree of increased risk of PD in first-degree relatives of 221 PD probands with age of onset 50 years or younger and 266 PD probands with age of onset older than 50 years compared with the first-degree relatives of 409 control probands. Risk of PD was similar among first-degree relatives of early-onset PD probands (risk ratio [RR], 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-5.0; p = 0.0002) and late-onset PD probands (RR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.4; p = 0.0002) when each was compared with first-degree relatives of controls. However, siblings of early-onset PD probands were at markedly increased risk of PD compared with siblings of controls (RR, 7.9; 95% CI, 2.5-25.5; p = 0.0005), whereas parents of early-onset PD probands were not at significantly increased risk compared with parents of controls (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.9-3.3; p = 0.2). In late-onset families, both siblings (RR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.3-10.3; p = 0.02) and parents (RR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4-4.6; p = 0.003) were at increased risk compared with control relatives. This pattern is consistent with an autosomal recessive contribution to the inheritance of early but not late-onset PD. Genetic factors are important in both early- and late-onset PD, but specific genes and mode of inheritance may differ between the two groups."
"Low-grade gliomas frequently are associated with epilepsy. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of epilepsy and antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment on cognitive functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in these patients. One hundred fifty-six patients without clinical or radiological signs of tumor recurrence for at least 1 year after histological diagnosis and with an epilepsy burden (based on seizure frequency and AED use) ranging from none to severe were compared with healthy controls. The association between epilepsy burden and cognition/HRQOL was also investigated. Eighty-six percent of the patients had epilepsy and 50% of those using AEDs actually were seizure-free. Compared with healthy controls, glioma patients had significant reductions in information processing speed, psychomotor function, attentional functioning, verbal and working memory, executive functioning, and HRQOL. The increase in epilepsy burden that was associated with significant reductions in all cognitive domains except for attentional and memory functioning could primarily be attributed to the use of AEDs, whereas the decline in HRQOL could be ascribed to the lack of complete seizure control. In conclusion, low-grade glioma patients suffer from a number of neuropsychological and psychological problems that are aggravated by the severity of epilepsy and by the intensity of the treatment."
"We found voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) antibodies in 4 of 15 patients with limbic encephalitis (LE). Two patients with idiopathic LE had high VGKC antibody levels (&gt;800 pM; controls &lt;100 pM), that fell in parallel with a clinical response to immunotherapy. Two patients with lower VGKC antibodies (170 pM, 300 pM) had lung cancer (radiological evidence only in one) and the LE improved with immunotherapy in one. The other 11 patients without VGKC antibodies had paraneoplastic LE and eight onconeural antibodies (Hu in 6; Ma2 in 2). VGKC antibodies do not unambiguously discriminate between idiopathic or paraneoplastic LE but probably indicate a good response to immunotherapy."
"Thirty-four patients with advanced Parkinson's disease participated in a prospective 24-month double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of fetal nigral transplantation. Patients were randomized to receive bilateral transplantation with one or four donors per side or a placebo procedure. The primary end point was change between baseline and final visits in motor component of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale in the practically defined off state. There was no significant overall treatment effect (p = 0.244). Patients in the placebo and one-donor groups deteriorated by 9.4 +/- 4.25 and 3.5 +/- 4.23 points, respectively, whereas those in the four-donor group improved by 0.72 +/- 4.05 points. Pairwise comparisons were not significant, although the four-donor versus placebo groups yielded a p value of 0.096. Stratification based on disease severity showed a treatment effect in milder patients (p = 0.006). Striatal fluorodopa uptake was significantly increased after transplantation in both groups and robust survival of dopamine neurons was observed at postmortem examination. Fifty-six percent of transplanted patients developed dyskinesia that persisted after overnight withdrawal of dopaminergic medication (""off""-medication dyskinesia). Fetal nigral transplantation currently cannot be recommended as a therapy for PD based on these results."
"Mutations in the tau gene cause familial frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17. Here, we describe two Dutch families with familial frontotemporal dementia associated with the novel missense mutation L315R in exon 11 of tau. The age at onset of disease showed a large variation within each family, ranging from 25 to 64 years. Incomplete penetrance was established in an 82-year-old mutation carrier with no signs of dementia and appeared probable in two additional subjects. The brains of two affected subjects were studied and showed extensive tau pathology in neurons (Pick-like inclusions) and astroglial cells, particularly in the frontotemporal cortex and the hippocampal formation. Sarkosyl-insoluble tau extracted from the cerebral cortex showed the presence of straight and twisted tau filaments and a pattern of pathological tau bands similar to that of Pick's disease. Upon dephosphorylation, only five of the six brain tau isoforms were observed, with the shortest isoform being undetectable. All six tau isoforms were present in soluble brain tau. Recombinant tau proteins with the L315R mutation showed a reduced ability to promote microtubule assembly."
"Regular physical activity is associated with a decrease of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events, which may relate to enhanced endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Here, we provide evidence that physical activity protects against ischemic stroke via mechanisms related to the upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the vasculature. Voluntary training on running wheels or exercise on a treadmill apparatus for 3 weeks, respectively, reduced cerebral infarct size and functional deficits, improved endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, and augmented cerebral blood flow in wild-type mice. The neuroprotective effects of physical training were completely absent in eNOS-deficient mice, indicating that the enhanced eNOS activity by physical training was the predominant mechanism by which this modality protects against cerebral injury. Our results suggest that physical activity not only decreases stroke risk, but also provides a prophylactic treatment strategy for increasing blood flow and reducing brain injury during cerebral ischemia."
"Delayed cerebral vasospasm has a major impact on the outcome of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Two important candidates to cause the arterial spasm are the red blood cell product oxyhemoglobin and the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1, although oxyhemoglobin alone is not sufficient to induce cerebral ischemia and endothelin-1 leads to ischemia only at relatively high concentrations. In this study, we demonstrated that the combination of oxyhemoglobin and endothelin-1 triggered spreading neuronal activation in rat cortex in vivo. In contrast with the expected transient increase of regional cerebral blood flow during spreading depression, however, cerebral blood flow decreased profoundly and was long-lasting, paralleled by delayed repolarization of the steady (direct current) potential. These changes are characteristic of cortical spreading ischemia. Replacing oxyhemoglobin for the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine mimicked these effects, implicating nitric oxide scavenging functions of oxyhemoglobin. Furthermore, the effect of endothelin-1 was related to a reduction of Na(+)-/K(+)-ATPase activity rather than solely to its vasoconstrictive properties. In conclusion, the threshold concentration of endothelin-1 that induces cerebral ischemia is profoundly reduced via a complex interaction between the neuronal/astroglial network and the cortical microcirculation if nitric oxide availability declines. The results may have implications for the understanding of subarachnoid hemorrhage-related cortical lesions."
"Successful axon regeneration depends on the expression of regeneration-associated genes by axotomized neurons. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, the expression of regeneration-associated genes by axotomized human CNS neurons. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed a transient induction of GAP-43 and c-jun in Clarke's nucleus neurons caudal to traumatic human spinal cord injury. These results support experimental data that nonregenerating central nervous system neurons can temporarily upregulate regeneration-associated genes, reflecting a transient regenerative capacity that fails over time."
"We investigated whether the second wind phenomenon (ie, a decrease in heart rate and perceived exertion during exercise) is pathognomonic for McArdle's disease. Twenty-four patients with McArdle's disease, 17 healthy subjects, and 25 patients with other inborn errors of muscle metabolism cycled a constant workload for 15 minutes. In McArdle's disease patients, heart rate consistently decreased by 35 +/- 3 beats per minute from the 7(th) to the 15(th) minute of exercise, whereas heart rate increased progressively with exercise in all 42 control subjects. The findings indicate that cycling at a moderate, constant workload provides a specific, sensitive, and simple diagnostic test for McArdle's disease."
"The cortical areas with vestibular input in humans were assessed by electrical stimulation in 260 patients with partial epilepsy who had undergone stereotactic intracerebral electroencephalogram recordings before surgery. Vestibular symptoms were electrically induced on 44 anatomical sites in 28 patients. The patients experienced illusions of rotation (yaw plane: 18, pitch plane: 6, roll plane: 6), translations (n = 6), or indefinable feelings of body motion (n = 8). Almost all vestibular sites were located in the cortex (41/44): in the temporal (n = 19), parietal (n = 14), frontal (n = 5), occipital (n = 2), and insular (n = 1) lobes. Among these sites, we identified a lateral cortical temporoparietal area we called the temporo-peri-Sylvian vestibular cortex (TPSVC), from which vestibular symptoms, and above all rotatory sensations, were particularly easily elicited (24/41 cortical sites, 58.5%). This area extended above and below the Sylvian fissure, mainly inside Brodmann areas 40, 21, and 22. It included the parietal operculum (9/24 TPSVC sites) which was particularly sensitive for eliciting pitch plane illusions, and the mid and posterior part of the first and second temporal gyri (15/24 TPSVC sites) which preferentially caused yaw plane illusions. We suggest that the TPSVC could be homologous with the monkey's parietoinsular vestibular cortex."
"Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between brain injury by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and vasculopathy by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in children with hemoglobin SS, the most serious form of sickle cell disease. We reviewed imaging for all 146 SS patients imaged at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital since 1993. Standard MRI criteria were used to identify cystic infarction, leukoencephalopathy, encephalomalacia, or atrophy. Standard MRA criteria were used to identify arterial tortuousity (limited vasculopathy), and stenosis or occlusion (extensive vasculopathy). At an average age of 10 years, the estimated prevalence of infarction, ischemic damage, or atrophy in SS patients was 46%, and of vasculopathy was 64%. Only 28% of patients were normal by both modalities, and patients abnormal by MRA often were abnormal by MRI (p &lt; 0.00001). Patients with cystic infarction had limited vasculopathy, whereas patients with encephalomalacia had stenosis or occlusion (p &lt; 0.0001). Large arteries were affected in 31% of brain injury patients, whereas small arteries are inferred to be abnormal in up to 69% of patients with brain injury. The degree of vasculopathy is closely related to the degree of brain injury, implying that vasculopathy is prodromal to most forms of brain injury in hemoglobin SS."
"This report describes the presence of reactive microglia, the accumulation of extracellular melanin, and the extensive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of monkeys administered 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) 5 to 14 years before death. This evidence of chronic neuroinflammation years after MPTP exposure is similar to that previously reported in humans. The monkeys were drug free for at least 3 years before death, indicating that a brief exposure to MPTP had instituted an ongoing inflammatory process. The mechanism is unknown but could have important implications regarding the cause of Parkinson's disease and possible approaches to therapy."
"Growth hormone (GH) is neuroprotective, presumably through its actions on GH receptor-mediated pathways. Here, we examined the effects of GH using in vitro and in vivo assays of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-induced neuronal injury. Neuronal cultures were in assays of neurotoxicity induced by supernatants from HIV-1 tat-transfected monocytoid cells (Tat supernatant). GH treatment reduced neuronal death compared with untreated cultures (p &lt; 0.001), which was blocked by a GH receptor antagonist, B2036. Tat supernatant-induced p53 expression in neurons was also reduced by GH treatment. Expression of both p53 and GH receptor were increased in brain tissue from HIV-infected persons compared with controls (p &lt; 0.05). Mice receiving intrastriatal implants of Tat supernatant and treated with GH showed less neurobehavioral abnormalities together with reduced neuroinflammation and neuronal injury compared with untreated animals (p &lt; 0.01). Three acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defined patients with neurocognitive impairment were serially evaluated during daily GH treatment showing a sustained improvement in neuropsychological performance (p &lt; 0.01). GH prevents neuronal death through its actions on neurons involving a p53-mediated pathway and also improved in vivo neurological function, indicating that GH may have a role in the treatment of HIV-induced neurodegeneration."
"Visual hallucinations are a core feature of dementia with Lewy bodies. Their pathophysiology is not well understood, because neither clinical nor histological data have shown their basic mechanisms. Here, we report the presence of pale inclusions in the outer plexiform layer of the retina in a patient with dementia with Lewy bodies. These inclusions are related to cytoskeletal disorganization of the cones at ultrastructural level and modifications of the immunohistochemical pattern of distribution of synucleins in the retina. These modifications may participate in the visual impairment in dementia with Lewy bodies."
"A 67-year-old woman had fever, myalgias, progressive weakness, and respiratory insufficiency. In 9 days, flaccid areflexic quadriparesis and bulbar palsy developed. She died 26 days after the onset of her illness. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid serology were positive for West Nile virus. Neuropathological study showed changes consistent with a viral encephalomyelitis, similar to poliomyelitis. The brainstem showed neuronal loss and multiple foci of necrosis. The spinal cord showed severe loss of anterior and posterior horn neurons. Immunohistochemistry identified West Nile virus antigens in the brainstem and spinal cord. Paralysis, in West Nile virus encephalitis, is caused by destruction of motor neurons."
"We evaluated reproductive endocrine function in women with unilateral temporolimbic epilepsy and normal control subjects to assess the effects of epilepsy, epilepsy laterality, and antiepileptic drug use on the cerebral regulation of hormonal secretion. The findings indicate that reproductive endocrine function differs between women with epilepsy and normal control subjects. Significant differences exist at all levels of the reproductive neuroendocrine axis, that is, hypothalamus, pituitary, and peripheral gland. Differences show significant relationships to the epilepsy itself as well as to medication use. Reproductive neuroendocrine changes occur in a stochastic manner such that the laterality of unilateral temporolimbic discharges is associated with predictable directional changes in hormonal secretion at all levels of the reproductive neuroendocrine axis. These directional changes are consistent with the finding that different reproductive disorders may develop in relation to left- and right-sided temporolimbic epilepsy. Hormonal changes can show close temporal relationship to the occurrence of interictal epileptiform discharges and may vary in relation to the laterality of the discharges. Antiepileptic drugs differ in their effects on reproductive hormone levels. There are notable differences between enzyme-inducing and noninducing drugs. Menstrual disorders are more common among women with interictal discharges as well as women with abnormal hormonal findings."
"Chemokines are a diverse group of small proteins that effect cell signaling by binding to G-protein-coupled, seven-trans-membrane receptors. Our group had found previously that the chemokine receptor CCR1 was present in neurons and dystrophic processes in a small sample of Alzheimer's disease cases. This expanded immunohistochemical study shows that the number of CCR1-positive plaque-like structures in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex is highly correlated to dementia state as measured by the clinical dementia rating score. CCR1 immunoreactivity is found in dystrophic, neurofilament-positive, synaptophysin-negative neurites that are associated with senile plaques containing amyloid beta peptides of the 1-42 species (Abeta42). CCR1 was not, however, associated with diffuse deposits of Abeta42. There was limited expression of CCR1 in neurofibrillary tangle-bearing neuritic processes. Astrocytes and microglia were typically negative for CCR1. Human brains from age-matched, nondemented individuals rarely displayed either CCR1 or Abeta42 immunoreactivity. Seven other types of dementing neurodegenerative diseases were examined, and all failed to demonstrate CCR1 immunopositivity unless Abeta42-positive plaques were also present. Thus, neuronal CCR1 is not a generalized marker of neurodegeneration. Rather, it appears to be part of the neuroimmune response to Abeta42-positive neuritic plaques."
"We describe a novel mutation in the ND6 gene (T14487C) in a patient with Leigh syndrome. Biochemical analyses indicated a low complex I activity in the patient's fibroblasts but normal values in muscle and liver. Cybrid clones showed a specific complex I defect that correlates with the mutant heteroplasmy levels. Additionally, we demonstrate an altered mobility and a decrease in the levels of fully assembled complex I in the patient's fibroblasts and cybrids, suggesting that the mutation has a profound effect on complex I assembly and/or stability."
"This study aimed to characterize cerebral perfusion in men with Klinefelter's syndrome, known to present specific deficits in language, using (99m)Tc- hexamethylpropylene-amine-oxime scintigraphy and Talairach normalization. While a perfusion asymmetry toward the left hemisphere was found in controls, perfusion was mostly symmetrical in Klinefelter patients in the upper temporal and lower parietal areas. Scores on verbal tests were inversely correlated with perfusion changes, providing neurobiological substrate of anomalous cerebral laterality."
"Mutations in the human alpha-sarcoglycan gene on chromosome 17q21.2 have been shown to cause a severe childhood autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy, a less severe limb girdle muscular dystrophy, exercise intolerance, or asymptomatic hyperCKemia. Here, we describe the clinical findings in a German family harboring a 371 T &gt; C (Ile124Thr) missense mutation in the alpha-sarcoglycan gene. Whereas our index patient, an 11-year-old girl homozygous for this mutation, presented with a severe Duchenne-like phenotype, 7 out of 12 heterozygous mutation carriers from three generations showed mild to moderate scapular winging. In analogy to symptomatic female dystrophinopathy carriers, our results suggest that heterozygous alpha-sarcoglycan gene mutation carriers can be symptomatic with selective muscle weakness. This finding may be attributed to an additional negative variation in a yet unknown modifier gene essential to the function of the sarcoglycan complex in shoulder girdle muscles."
"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited motor neuron disease caused by mutation of the telomeric copy of the survival motor neuron gene (SMN1). Although a centromeric copy of the survival motor neuron gene (SMN2) is retained in all patients with SMA, it differs from SMN1 at a critical nucleotide such that the majority of SMN2 transcripts lack exon 7 and encode an unstable, truncated protein. Here, we show that valproic acid increases levels of exon 7-containing SMN transcript and SMN protein in type I SMA patient-derived fibroblast cell lines. Valproic acid may increase SMN levels both by activating the SMN promoter and by preventing exon 7 skipping in SMN transcripts. Valproic acid and related compounds warrant further investigation as potential treatment for SMA."
"Human trigeminal ganglia were tested by double fluorescence in situ hybridization for the presence and distribution of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) latency. Latency transcripts of both viruses were detected in common areas within the ganglia. Also, a few single neurons were shown to harbor HSV-1 and VZV together."
"We present the clinicopathological features of two siblings from a consanguineous marriage who presented with respiratory hypoventilation and died 10 days and 4 years later, respectively. This disorder showed extensive tau neuropathology, and both had a novel homozygous S352L tau gene mutation. This is the first description of a pathologically proved young-onset tauopathy with apparent recessive inheritance."
"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) causes morbidity and mortality and commonly follows the reperfusion after an ischemic event. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a fibrinolytic serine protease, is routinely given for the treatment of stroke. However, tPA also can promote neuronal death, suggesting that caution should be exercised when using it. Furthermore, tPA upon brain injury mediates microglial activation and modulates neuronal survival. To investigate the role of tPA and microglia during brain hemorrhage, we induced experimentally ICH by intracerebral injection of collagenase. Seven days after the introduction of ICH, it persisted in tPA-deficient (tPA(-/-)) mice but is drastically reduced in size in wild-type mice. Three weeks after ICH, there are still red blood cells in tPA(-/-) but not in wild-type animals. Activated microglia persist around the injury site. When microglial activation is inhibited by tuftsin fragment 1-3 macrophage/microglial inhibitory factor (MIF), the stroke injury volume is significantly reduced, and the neurobehavioral deficits exhibited by the mice are improved. Our results suggest that endogenous tPA assists in the clearance of intracerebral hemorrhage, presumably by affecting microglial activation, and MIF could be a valuable neuroprotective agent for the treatment of ICH."
"We report the successful treatment using low-dose vigabatrin (21.5-34 mg/kg/day) of a 10-year-old girl with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency We verified that 4-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) concentrations in serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine continuously decreased in parallel with significant clinical improvement. Our results suggest that GHB quantification in physiological fluids may be a useful laboratory parameter for monitoring efficacy of vigabatrin treatment in SSADH deficiency."
"In a case of childhood-onset myoclonus epilepsy with ""ragged-red fibers"" (MERRF), a hitherto unreported mutation within the mitochondrial tRNA(Lys) gene was identified as the cause of the disease. Substitution G8361A was maternally inherited, heteroplasmic in all tissues tested, and correlated with mitochondrial dysfunction in individual muscle fibers. The growing number of MERRF-associated mutations within the tRNA(Lys) gene affirms the specific role of this mitochondrial tRNA in the pathogenesis of the disease."
"Autosomal recessive spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) is the second anterior horn cell disease in infants in which the genetic defect has been defined. SMARD1 results from mutations in the gene encoding the immunoglobulin micro-binding protein 2 (IGHMBP2) on chromosome 11q13. Our aim was to review the clinical features of 29 infants affected with SMARD1 and report on 26 novel IGHMBP2 mutations. Intrauterine growth retardation, weak cry, and foot deformities were the earliest symptoms of SMARD1. Most patients presented at the age of 1 to 6 months with respiratory distress due to diaphragmatic paralysis and progressive muscle weakness with predominantly distal lower limb muscle involvement. Sensory and autonomic nerves are also affected. Because of the poor prognosis, there is a demand for prenatal diagnosis, and clear diagnostic criteria for infantile SMARD1 are needed. The diagnosis of SMARD1 should be considered in infants with non-5q spinal muscular atrophy, neuropathy, and muscle weakness and/or respiratory distress of unclear cause. Furthermore, consanguineous parents of a child with sudden infant death syndrome should be examined for IGHMBP2 mutations."
"Episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) is a dominantly inherited disorder, characterized by spells of ataxia, dysarthria, vertigo, and migraines, associated with mutations in the neuronal calcium-channel gene CACNA1A. Ataxic spells lasting minutes to hours are provoked by stress, exercise, or alcohol. Some patients exhibit nystagmus between spells and some develop progressive ataxia later in life. At least 21 distinct CACNA1A mutations have been identified in EA2. The clinical and genetic complexities of EA2 have offered few insights into the underlying pathogenic mechanisms for this disorder. We identified a novel EA2 kindred in which members had ataxic spells induced by fevers or high environmental temperature. We identified a novel CACNA1A mutation (nucleotides 1253+1 G--&gt;A) that was present in all subjects with febrile spells or ataxia. Moreover, we found that, regardless of age or interictal clinical status, all affected subjects had objective evidence of abnormal saccades, ocular fixation, and postural stability. These findings suggest that early cerebellar dysfunction in EA2 results from the intrinsically abnormal properties of the CACNA1A channel rather than a degenerative process."
"The commonest cause of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is mutation in the spastin gene. Both the normal function of spastin in the central nervous system and the mechanism by which mutation in spastin causes axonal degeneration are unknown. One hypothesis is that mutant spastin disrupts microtubule dynamics, causing an impairment of organelle transport on the microtubule network, which leads to degeneration in the distal parts of long axons. To study this neuronal and non-neuronal cells were transfected with either wild type or mutant spastin proteins. We demonstrated evidence of a transient interaction of wild-type spastin with microtubules, with resulting disassembly of microtubules, supporting a role for wild-type spastin as a microtubule-severing protein. Mutant spastin demonstrated an abnormal interaction with microtubules, colocalizing with but no longer severing microtubules. The abnormal interaction of mutant spastin with microtubules was demonstrated to be associated with an abnormal perinuclear clustering of mitochondria and peroxisomes, suggestive of an impairment of kinesin-mediated intracellular transport. Our findings indicate that an abnormal interaction of mutant spastin with microtubules, which disrupts organelle transport on the microtubule cytoskeleton, is likely to be the primary disease mechanism in HSP caused by missense mutations in the spastin gene."
"We describe a family of Slovenian descent with progressive ataxia, corticospinal signs, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, and disruption of visual fixation by saccadic intrusions. Chromosome mapping indicated a mutation on 1p36, and this recessive disorder has been designated spinocerebellar ataxia with saccadic intrusions. Affected patients showed overshooting horizontal saccades, macrosaccadic oscillations, and increased velocity of larger saccades; other eye movements were normal. Slowed conduction in axons that are selectively vulnerable to the molecular defect could explain both the sensorimotor neuropathy and the saccadic disorder, which would be caused by delayed feedback control because of slow conduction in cerebellar parallel fibers."
"In this prospective study of 73 relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis patients followed up for a mean of 1.7 years, the relation was tested between serologically defined Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP) infection periods and exacerbation rate. Episodes of serologically defined CP infections were observed in a subgroup, and these episodes were associated with increased risk for exacerbation. CP polymerase chain reaction was positive in most of the CP seropositive patients. No correlation was found between the anti-CP antibody increase and titers of control antibodies."
"We describe an Italian pedigree with hereditary dementia associated with a novel T122R mutation in the presenilin-2 gene (PSEN2). The clinical history, symptom presentation, and structural neuroimaging were consistent with an atypical form of dementia. Disease expression varied within family members. One in a pair of mutated monozygotic twins had evident signs of disease, whereas the other did not, even if her functional neuroimaging investigations, cerebrospinal fluid levels of Abeta1-42, and Tau protein were able to provide markers for future disease development. These observations suggest the importance of still unknown biological and perhaps environmental factors in the disease determination."
"The amyloid-beta protein precursor, a type 1 transmembrane protein, gives rise to the amyloid beta-protein, a neurotoxic peptide postulated to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we show that soluble amyloid beta protein accelerates amyloid precursor protein complex formation, a process that contributes to neuronal cell death. The mechanism of cell death involves the recruitment of caspase-8 to the complex, followed by intracytoplasmic caspase cleavage of amyloid precursor protein. In vivo, the levels of soluble amyloid beta protein correlated with caspase-cleaved fragments of the amyloid precursor protein in brains of Alzheimer's disease subjects. These findings suggest that soluble amyloid beta protein-induced multimerization of the amyloid precursor protein may be another mechanism by which amyloid beta protein contributes to synapse loss and neuronal cell death seen in Alzheimer's disease."
"Two brothers with a leukodystrophy, progressive spastic diplegia, and peripheral neuropathy were found to have proteinaceous aggregates in the peripheral nerve myelin sheath. The patients' mother had only subclinical peripheral neuropathy, but the maternal grandmother had adult-onset leukodystrophy. Sequencing of the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene showed a point mutation IVS4 + 1 G--&gt;A within the donor splice site of intron 4. We identified one transcript with a deletion of exon 4 (Deltaex4, 169bp) encoding for PLP and DM20 proteins and lacking two transmembrane domains, and a second transcript with exon 4 + 10bp encoding three transmembrane domains. Immunohistochemistry showed abnormal aggregation in the myelin sheath of MBP and P0. Myelin-associated glycoprotein was present in the Schmidt-Lanterman clefts but significantly reduced in the periaxonal region. Using immunogold electron microscopy, we demonstrated the presence of mutated PLP/DM20 and the absence of the intact protein in the patient peripheral myelin sheath. We conclude that insertion of mutant PLP/DM20 with resulting aberrant distribution of other myelin proteins in peripheral nerve may constitute an important mechanism of dysmyelination in disorders associated with PLP mutations."
"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2) are caused by genomic expansions of CTG or CCTG repeats. When transcribed, these mutations give rise to repeat expansion RNAs that form nuclear inclusions and compromise the function of myonuclei. Here, we have used in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence to compare DM1 and DM2 and search for proteins that associate with the RNA nuclear (ribonuclear) inclusions. Although muscle disease is generally more severe in DM1, the ribonuclear inclusions were 8- to 13-fold more intense in DM2, implying greater amounts of repeat expansion RNA. Expression of repeat expansion RNA in myoblasts has been implicated in the pathogenesis of congenital DM1. However, we found that repeat expansion RNA is also expressed in myoblasts in DM2, a disorder that has not been associated with a congenital phenotype. Of 10 putative CUG binding proteins tested for colocalization with mutant RNA, only proteins in the muscleblind family were recruited into ribonuclear inclusions. Previous studies have shown activation of the protein kinase, PKR, by expanded CUG repeats in vitro. However, breeding experiments utilizing PKR knockout mice indicate that this kinase is not required for disease pathogenesis in a transgenic mouse model of DM1. We conclude that ribonuclear inclusions are a key feature of the muscle pathology in DM and that sequestration of muscleblind proteins may have a direct role in the disease process."
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated demyelinating condition in which numerous soluble mediators have been implicated. We have extended the repertoire of cytokines studied in MS tissue by examining interleukin (IL-4), IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, interferon (IFNgamma), and their receptors and have compared patterns with those seen in normal subjects and other neurological diseases (OND). Expression was evaluated by immunocytochemistry and Western blots. Remarkably, oligodendrocytes expressed all the cytokine receptors examined, particularly Th2-type, constitutively in normal subjects and upregulated in disease. Microglial cells also expressed cytokine receptors at similar levels. Cytokine expression was invariably a feature of microglial cells, except for IL-10, which was exclusively astrocytic. Oligodendrocytes did not display cytokines, except for low levels of IL-18. Although no pattern was specific for MS, most molecules were upregulated in MS and OND. Downstream JAK/STAT molecules were correspondingly upregulated. Cytokine receptors on oligodendrocytes (and microglia), and their corresponding ligands on microglia (and astrocytes), may implicate paracrine/autocrine regulation and may bespeak innate immunity in the central nervous system."
"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha overexpression has been related to experimental ischemic tolerance when transient ischemia precedes cerebral infarction. We investigated TNF-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 plasma concentrations in 283 patients with an acute stroke within 24 hours after symptom onset. An ipsilateral transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 72 hours before stroke was recorded in 38 patients. The infarct volume measured on computed tomography on days 4 to 7 and the frequency of poor outcome (Barthel Index score &lt; 85) at 3 months were significantly lower in patients with prior TIA. Plasma concentrations of TNF-alpha were higher (42.5 +/- 9.9 vs 13.1 +/- 6.4pg/ml, p &lt; 0.0001) and IL-6 levels were lower (10.1 +/- 6.2 vs 28.3 +/- 17.3pg/ml, p &lt; 0.0001) in patients with prior TIA. A new variable termed TNF-alpha/IL-6 index was considered positive when TNF-alpha was greater than 30pg/ml and IL-6 was less than 30pg/ml. Positive TNF-alpha/IL-6 index was found in 92% of patients with prior TIA and in 1% of those without. TNF-alpha/IL-6 index (p = 0.0003) and TIA (p = 0.0001) were associated with good outcome in logistic regression analysis after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Ischemic tolerance in acute stroke is associated with increased plasma levels of TNF-alpha in the presence of reduced concentrations of IL-6."
"In this postmortem study, we investigated the relationship between multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in the hypothalamus and the state of activity of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-producing neurons that control the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. A high incidence (15/16) of MS lesions was found in the hypothalamus, of which more than 50% was active, that is, contained activated macrophages. MS patients have increased numbers of CRH-immunoreactive neurons coexpressing vasopressin (CRH/VP neurons), a sign of chronic activation of CRH neurons and increased CRH mRNA expression. Active MS lesions correlated with a low number of hyperactive CRH/VP neurons. High human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, -DP, -DQ expression, a measure for macrophage and microglial activation, correlated with low CRH mRNA expression. The nearer the HLA expression was situated to the CRH neurons, the stronger the inhibiting effect, suggesting that activated microglial cells or macrophages suppress these neurons. The more active MS lesions were present in the hypothalamus, the shorter was the disease duration until the moment of death, indicating an unfavorable course of the disease. Thus, MS patients have a chronically activated CRH system, but, in the subgroup of patients with active MS lesions in the hypothalamus, this activation is impaired and the disease course is worse."
"We here report the second and third mutations in alphaB-crystallin causing myofibrillar myopathy. Two patients had adult-onset muscle weakness. Patient 1 had cervical, limb girdle, and respiratory muscle weakness and died of respiratory failure. Patient 2 had proximal and distal leg muscle weakness. Both had myopathic electromyogram with abnormal electrical irritability and muscle biopsy findings of myofibrillar myopathy and mild denervation. Myofibrillar disintegration begins at the Z-disk and results in abnormal local expression of desmin, alphaB-crystallin, dystrophin, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), and CDC2 kinase. Seven to 8% of nuclei display early apoptotic changes. Both patients carry a truncating mutation in the C-terminal region of alphaB-crystallin (464delCT in Patient 1 and Q151X in Patient 2) which is crucial for the solubilization and chaperone functions of the molecule. cDNA analysis shows the same mutations and no alternatively spliced transcripts. Immunoblots of muscle demonstrate increased expression of wild-type and reduced expression of the mutant protein. Immunoblots under nondenaturing conditions show that the mutant protein forms lower than normal molecular weight multimeric complexes with wild type. We conclude that (1) despite its reduced expression, the mutant protein exerts a dominant negative effect; (2) mutations in alphaB-crystallin are an infrequent cause of myofibrillar myopathy; (3) alphaB-crystallin-related myopathies display phenotypic heterogeneity."
"We updated the clinical features of a consanguineous Arab Israeli family, in which four of seven children were affected by spastic paraplegia complicated by skin pigmentary abnormalities. A genomewide linkage screen performed for the family identified a new locus (SPG23) for this form of hereditary spastic paraplegia, in an approximately 25cM region of chromosome 1q24-q32, with a peak logarithm of odds score of 3.05."
"Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC), a clinical syndrome characterized by multiple congenital joint contractures, frequently is caused by lesions in the peripheral nervous system. Two standard tests for the evaluation of the motor unit are nerve conduction studies/electromyography (NCS/EMG) and muscle biopsy. We reviewed the diagnostic value of these two studies in the evaluation of AMC over a 23-year period, analyzing 38 patients with AMC who had NCS/EMG, muscle biopsy, or both. Final diagnoses were classified as neurogenic (8 patients), myopathic (10 patients), ""other"" (12 patients), or unknown (8 patients). Neither test alone had consistently high sensitivities, positive predictive values, or specificities. However, when NCS/EMG and muscle biopsy were concordant for neurogenic or myopathic findings, they were more accurate than either test alone, especially for neurogenic diseases. Test results were most commonly discordant in patients with ""other"" or unknown diagnoses. These findings suggest that when the clinical evaluation indicates a specific syndromic, developmental, or exogenous cause, NCS/EMG and muscle biopsy are not helpful and may not need to be performed. When the history, examination, and genetic evaluation are unrevealing, NCS/EMG and muscle biopsy together provide valuable diagnostic information."
"We measured ischemic brain changes with diffusion and perfusion MRI in 42 ischemic stroke patients before and 2 hours (range approximately 1.5 to 4.5 hours) after standard intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy. The median time from stroke onset to tPA was 131 minutes. Clinical and MRI variables (change in perfusion and/or diffusion weighted lesion volume) were compared between those with excellent outcome defined as 3-month modified Rankin score (mRS) of 0 to 1 and those with incomplete recovery (mRS &gt;1). In multivariate logististic regression analysis, the most powerful independent predictor for excellent outcome was improved brain perfusion: hypoperfusion volume on mean transit time (MTT) map decrease &gt;30% from baseline to 2-hour post tPA scan (p=0.009; odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 20.7 [2.1-203.9]). Except for age &lt; 70 years, no other baseline clinical or imaging variable was an independent predictor of outcome. We propose MTT lesion volume decrease more than 30% 2 hours after tPA as an early marker of long-term clinical benefit of thrombolytic therapy."
"Two novel mutations recently have been identified in the DJ-1 gene that cause a new form of autosomal recessive, early-onset parkinsonism. Because the pathological role of this protein is unknown, we examined the issue here and report the colocalization of DJ-1 protein within a subset of pathological tau inclusions in a diverse group of neurodegenerative disorders known as tauopathies. Our study extends the view that different neurodegenerative diseases may have similar pathological mechanisms, and that these processes likely include DJ-1."
"We highlight the first case to our knowledge of vascular parkinsonism with angiographic moyamoya and functional imaging correlates. In addition, transmission electron microscopy of the cutaneous vasculature revealed the mean smooth muscle cell layer of the terminal arterioles to be significantly higher compared with ischemic stroke patients classified by vascular risk factors. Smooth muscle cell thickness was also greater in those with small vessel and large vessel strokes compared with cardioembolic strokes. The marked cutaneous arteriolar smooth muscle cell hypertrophy may be a useful surrogate marker for those at risk of developing angiographic moyamoya."
"Glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is an inherited organic aciduria with predominantly neurological presentation. Biochemically, it is characterized by an accumulation and enhanced urinary excretion of two key organic acids, glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid. If untreated, acute striatal degeneration is often precipitated by febrile illnesses during a vulnerable period of brain development in infancy or early childhood, resulting in a dystonic dyskinetic movement disorder. The mechanism underlying these acute encephalopathic crises has been partially elucidated using in vitro and in vivo models. 3-Hydroxyglutaric and glutaric acids share structural similarities with the main excitatory amino acid glutamate and are considered to play an important role in the pathophysiology of this disease. 3-Hydroxyglutaric acid induces excitotoxic cell damage specifically via activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Furthermore, glutaric and 3-hydroxyglutaric acids indirectly modulate glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, resulting in an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. It also has been suggested that secondary amplification loops potentiate the neurotoxic properties of these organic acids. Probable mechanisms for this effect include cytokine-stimulated nitric oxide production, a decrease in energy metabolism, and reduction of cellular creatine phosphate levels. Finally, maturation-dependent changes in the expression of neuronal glutamate receptors may affect the vulnerability to 3-hydroxyglutaric and glutaric acid toxicity."
"Both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA mutations can cause energy generation disorders. Respiratory chain complex I deficiency is the most common energy generation disorder and a frequent cause of infantile mitochondrial encephalopathies such as Leigh's disease and lethal infantile mitochondrial disease. Most such cases have been assumed to be caused by nuclear gene defects, but recently an increasing number have been shown to be caused by mutations in the mitochondrially encoded complex I subunit genes ND4, ND5, and ND6. We report the first four cases of infantile mitochondrial encephalopathies caused by mutations in the ND3 subunit gene. Three unrelated children have the same novel heteroplasmic mutation (T10158C), only the second mutation reported in ND3, and one has the previously identified T10191C mutation. Both mutations cause disproportionately greater reductions in enzyme activity than in the amount of fully assembled complex I, suggesting the ND3 subunit plays an unknown but important role in electron transport, proton pumping, or ubiquinone binding. Three cases appear to have a de novo mutation, with no mutation detected in maternal relatives. Mitochondrial DNA disease may be considerably more prevalent in the pediatric population than currently predicted and should be considered in patients with infantile mitochondrial encephalopathies and complex I deficiency."
"We identified 5345 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) among US veterans who first entered military service between 1960 and 1994, and who were ""service-connected"" for MS by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Two controls per case were matched on age, date of service entry, and branch of service. Available for service and VA files were demographic and military data for 4951 cases and 9378 controls. Versus white men, relative risk of MS was significantly higher for all women, at 2.99 for whites, 2.86 for blacks, and 3.51 for those of other races. This was a significant increase from our prior series of veterans of World War II and the Korean Conflict, where white women had a relative risk of 1.79. Risk for black men was higher now (0.67 vs 0.44), while other men remained low (0.30 vs 0.22). Residence at service entry in the northern tier of states had a relative risk of 2.02 versus the southern tier, which was significantly less than the 2.64 for the earlier series. Residence by individual state at birth and service entry for white men further supported this decreasing geographic differential. Such marked changes in geography, sex, and race in such a short interval strongly imply a primary environmental factor in the cause or precipitation of this disease."
"The long-term effects of brief but repetitive febrile seizures (FS) on memory have not been as thoroughly investigated as the impact of single and prolonged seizure in the developing brain. Using a heated-air FS paradigm, we subjected male rat pups to one, three, or nine episodes of brief FS on days 10 to 12 postpartum. Neither hippocampal neuronal damage nor apoptosis was noted within 72 hours after FS, nor was there significant hippocampal neuronal loss, aberrant mossy fiber sprouting, or altered seizure threshold to pentylenetetrazol in any FS group at adulthood. The adult rats subjected to nine episodes of early-life FS, however, showed long-term memory deficits as assessed by the Morris water maze. They also exhibited impaired intermediate and long-term memory but spared short-term memory in the inhibitory avoidance task. Three hours after inhibitory avoidance training, phosphorylation of cAMP response-element binding (CREB) protein in the hippocampus was significantly lower in nine-FS-group rats than in controls. Furthermore, rolipram administration, which activated the cAMP-CREB signaling pathway by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type IV, reversed the long-term memory deficits in nine-FS-group rats by enhancing hippocampal CREB phosphorylation. These results raise concerns about the long-term cognitive consequences of even brief frequently repetitive FS during early brain development."
"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) are neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized by intracytoplasmic aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau with four microtubule-binding repeats. Although PSP and CBD have distinctive pathological features, no biochemical difference in aggregated tau has been identified. In this study, we examined the brains of eight patients with PSP, six patients with CBD, and one atypical case with pathological features of both CBD and PSP. On immunoblots of sarkosyl-insoluble brain extracts, a 33kDa band predominated in the low molecular weight tau fragments in PSP, whereas two closely related bands of approximately 37kDa predominated in CBD. Immunoblots of the atypical case showed both the 33kDa band and the 37kDa doublet. Protein sequencing and immunochemical analyses showed that the 33kDa band and the 37kDa doublet consisted of the carboxyl half of tau with different amino termini. These results suggest that, despite the identical composition of tau isoforms, different proteolytic processing of abnormal tau takes place in these two diseases. Such a biochemical divergence may be related to the neuropathological features of these diseases."
"We compared neurocognitive indices with clinical status, mutation analysis, and urea synthetic capacity in 19 women heterozygous for ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Although as a group, these women had average IQ scores, they displayed a specific neuropsychological phenotype with significant strengths in verbal intelligence, verbal learning, verbal memory, and reading, and significant weaknesses in fine motor dexterity/speed and nonsignificant weaknesses in nonverbal intelligence, visual memory, attention/executive skills, and math. This suggests selective vulnerability of white matter and better preservation of gray matter. When the group was divided into symptomatic and asymptomatic subgroups, based on either clinical history or residual urea synthetic capacity, the asymptomatic subgroup outperformed the symptomatic subgroup on all tested domains of neuropsychological functioning. Furthermore, the amount of residual urea synthetic capacity was predictive of several end point cognitive measures. There was no correlation between neonatal versus late-onset mutation or between normal or abnormal allopurinol challenge and neuropsychological outcome. In sum, we identified a specific metabolic and neurocognitive phenotype in women heterozygous for ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. The findings support the importance of maintaining meticulous metabolic control in children with urea cycle disorders, because even mildly symptomatic subjects demonstrate cognitive deficits."
"Familial parkinsonism and dementia with cortical and subcortical Lewy bodies is uncommon, and no genetic defect has been reported in the previously described sibships. We present a Spanish family with autosomal dominant parkinsonism, dementia, and visual hallucinations of variable severity. The postmortem examination showed atrophy of the substantia nigra, lack of Alzheimer pathology, and numerous Lewy bodies which were immunoreactive to alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin in cortical and subcortical areas. Sequencing of the alpha-synuclein gene showed a novel, nonconservative E46K mutation in heterozygosis. The E46K mutation was present in all affected family members and in three young asymptomatic subjects, but it was absent in healthy and pathological controls. The novel mutation, that substitutes a dicarboxylic amino acid, glutamic acid, with a basic amino acid such as lysine in a much conserved area of the protein, is likely to produce severe disturbance of protein function. Our data show that, in addition to the previously described hereditary alpha-synucleinopathies, dementia with Lewy bodies is related to mutation of alpha-synuclein."
"Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) can rapidly detect lesions in acute ischemic stroke patients. The PWI volume is typically substantially larger than the DWI volume shortly after onset, that is, a diffusion/ perfusion mismatch. The aims of this study were to follow the evolution of the diffusion/ perfusion mismatch in permanent and 60- minute temporary focal experimental ischemia models in Sprague-Dawley rats using the intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) method. DWI and arterial spin-labeled PWI were performed at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes after occlusion and lesion volumes (mm(3)) calculated At 24 hours after MCAO, and infarct volume was determined using triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. In the permanent MCAO group, the lesion volume on the ADC maps was significantly smaller than that on the cerebral blood flow maps through the first 60 minutes after MCAO; but not after 90 minutes of occlusion. With 60 minutes of transient ischemia, the diffusion/perfusion mismatch was similar, but after reperfusion, the lesion volumes on ADC and cerebral blood flow maps became much smaller. There was a significant difference in 24- hour infarct volumes between the permanent and temporary occlusion groups."
"Dendritic cells are potent antigen-presenting cells that initiate and amplify immune responses. To determine whether dendritic cells participate in inflammatory reactions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we examined mRNA expression of dendritic cell surface markers in individual sporadic ALS (sALS), familial ALS (fALS), and nonneurological disease control (NNDC) spinal cord tissues using semiquantitative and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Immature (DEC205, CD1a) and activated/mature (CD83, CD40) dendritic cell transcripts were significantly elevated in ALS tissues. The presence of immature and activated/mature dendritic cells (CD1a(+) and CD83(+)) was confirmed immunohistochemically in ALS ventral horn and corticospinal tracts. Monocytic/macrophage/microglial transcripts (CD14, CD18, SR-A, CD68) were increased in ALS spinal cord, and activated CD68(+) cells were demonstrated in close proximity to motor neurons. mRNA expressions of the chemokine MCP-1, which attracts monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells, and of the cytokine macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) were increased in ALS tissues. The MCP-1 protein was expressed in glia in ALS but not in control tissues and was increased in the CSF of ALS patients. Those patients who progressed most rapidly expressed significantly more dendritic transcripts than patients who progressed more slowly. These results support the involvement of immune/inflammatory responses in amplifying motor neuron degeneration in ALS."
"Detrusor hyperreflexia is a relevant clinical symptom for patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. In a series of 16 patients, we demonstrated that subthalamic deep brain stimulation has a significant and urodynamically recordable effect leading to a normalization of pathologically increased bladder sensibility."
"Generally, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is caused by a germline mutation of the VHL gene (chromosome 3p), and tumorigenesis is initiated from a ""second-hit"" deletion. A subset of VHL patients have a germline deletion of the VHL gene, and the molecular events leading to tumorigenesis are not fully understood. To determine the molecular pathogenesis of tumor formation in this setting, we analyzed five central nervous system hemangioblastomas from three patients of a single VHL germline deletion kindred, all displaying mild clinical phenotype. Rather than loss of heterozygosity (the ""second hit"" in VHL germline mutation patients), all tumors from this kindred showed ""second-hit"" point mutations on the wild-type allele. Moreover, in two patients who each had two hemangioblastomas resected each tumor contained a unique mutation. The specific germline deletion and the overall genetic makeup of the patient did not predict these random ""second-hit"" point mutations. These results suggest that in patients with germline deletion of a tumor suppressor gene there is a unique genetic mechanism underlying tumorigenesis. This unique genetic mechanism correlates with and may help to understand the mild clinical phenotype seen in these patients."
"Early-onset ataxia with ocular motor apraxia and hypoalbuminemia (EAOH) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by early-onset ataxia, ocular motor apraxia, and hypoalbuminemia. Recently, the causative gene for EAOH, APTX, has been identified. Of the two splicing variants of APTX mRNA, the short and the long forms, long-form APTX mRNA was found to be the major isoform. Aprataxin is mainly located in the nucleus, and, furthermore, the first nuclear localization signal located near the amino terminus of the long-form aprataxin is essential for its nuclear localization. We found, based on the yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, that the long-form but not the short-form aprataxin interacts with XRCC1 (x-ray repair cross-complementing group 1). Interestingly the amino terminus of the long-form aprataxin is homologous with polynucleotidekinase-3'-phosphatase, which has been demonstrated to be involved in base excision repair, a subtype of single-strand DNA break repair, through interaction with XRCC1, DNA polymerase beta, and DNA ligase III. These results strongly support the possibility that aprataxin and XRCC1 constitute a multiprotein complex and are involved in single-strand DNA break repair, and furthermore, that accumulation of unrepaired damaged DNA underlies the pathophysiological mechanisms of EAOH."
"Cerebral palsy (CP) is a major neurodevelopmental disability in childhood. An association between intrauterine infection and CP has been reported. We examined the relationship between inflammatory mediators in cord serum and CP in term and preterm children. Regional multicenter study was conducted on 19 CP children and 19 gestation-matched paired controls. CP children (n = 27) were further compared with controls of similar gestation at birth (n = 25). Serum levels of 78 protein mediators were analyzed. Eleven analytes correlated with the length of gestation both in cases and controls. In paired analysis, B-lymphocyte chemoattractant, ciliary neurotrophic factor, epidermal growth factor, interleukin (IL)-5, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein-3, monokine induced by interferon gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand were higher in children with CP (p &lt; or = 0.05). Preterm infants with CP showed higher epidermal growth factor and lower levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-2, macrophage-derived chemokine, and pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine than their paired controls. Inflammatory mediators and growth factors serve as a footprint of the fetal response to an insult manifesting after birth as a permanent brain damage. The cytokine patterns at birth differ between premature and term infants who develop CP."
"To explore the clinical effects of inflammation associated with vascular deposits of the amyloid beta peptide (A beta), we analyzed 42 consecutive patients with pathologically diagnosed cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) for evidence of an inflammatory response. Inflammation with giant-cell reaction surrounding amyloid-laden vessels was identified in 7 of the 42 cases. The clinical symptoms in each of the seven were subacute cognitive decline or seizure rather than hemorrhagic stroke, the primary clinical presentation in 33 of 35 patients with noninflammatory CAA (p &lt; 0.001). Inflammatory CAA also was associated with radiographic white matter abnormalities, significantly younger age at presentation, and a marked overrepresentation of the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4/epsilon 4 genotype (71% vs 4%, p &lt; 0.001). Of the six inflammatory CAA patients with available follow-up information, five demonstrated clinical and radiographic improvement after immunosuppressive treatment. The syndrome of CAA-related perivascular inflammation appears to represent a subset of CAA with clinically distinct symptoms that may respond to immunosuppressive treatment. These data add to evidence that inflammation against A beta can cause vascular dysfunction, a potential mechanism for the toxic response recently observed in clinical trials of A beta immunization."
"Acute quadriplegic myopathy (AQM; also called ""critical illness myopathy"") shows acute muscle wasting and weakness and is experienced by some patients with severe systemic illness, often associated with administration of corticosteroids and/or neuroblocking agents. Key aspects of AQM include muscle atrophy and myofilament loss. Although these features are shared with neurogenic atrophy, myogenic atrophy in AQM appears mechanistically distinct from neurogenic atrophy. Using muscle biopsies from AQM, neurogenic atrophy, and normal controls, we show that both myogenic and neurogenic atrophy share induction of myofiber-specific ubiquitin/proteosome pathways (eg, atrogin-1). However, AQM patient muscle showed a specific strong induction of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta/MAPK pathways. Atrophic AQM myofibers showed coexpression of TGF-beta receptors, p38 MAPK, c-jun, and c-myc, including phosphorylated active forms, and these same fibers showed apoptotic features. Our data suggest a model of AQM pathogenesis in which stress stimuli (sepsis, corticosteroids, pH imbalance, osmotic imbalance) converge on the TGF-beta pathway in myofibers. The acute stimulation of the TGF-beta/MAPK pathway, coupled with the inactivity-induced atrogin-1/proteosome pathway, leads to the acute muscle loss seen in AQM patients."
"Disproportionate impairment of naming nouns versus verbs and the opposite pattern have been reported in cases of focal brain damage or degenerative disease, indicating that processing of nouns and verbs may rely on different brain regions. However, it has not been clear whether it is the spoken word forms or the meanings (or both) of nouns and verbs that depend on separate neural regions. We tested oral and written naming of nouns and verbs, matched in difficulty, in patients with nonfluent primary progressive aphasia (nonfluent PPA; n = 15), fluent primary progressive aphasia (fluent PPA; n = 7), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD; n = 6). Patients with nonfluent PPA and ALS-FTD, both individually and as groups, were significantly more impaired on verb naming than on noun naming and significantly more impaired on oral naming than written naming. Patients with fluent PPA showed the opposite pattern for both word class and modality, significantly more impaired naming of nouns versus verbs and significantly more impaired written versus oral naming. Results indicate that separate regions of the brain are essential for access to oral and written word forms of verbs and nouns, and that these neural regions can be differentially damaged in separate forms of PPA."
"Pathologicalprion protein (PrP(Sc)) is the hallmark of prion diseases affecting primarily the central nervous system. Using immunohistochemistry, paraffin-embedded tissue blot, and Western blot, we demonstrated abundant PrP(Sc) in the muscle of a patient with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and inclusion body myositis. Extraneural PrP(C)-PrP(Sc) conversion in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease appears to become prominent when PrP(C) is abundantly available as substrate, as in inclusion body myositis muscle."
"The dopamine D(1) receptor is considered to participate in levodopa's antiparkinsonian action and levodopa-induced dyskinesias. We examined the functional status of the D(1) receptor in brain of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Dopamine-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was significantly increased in putamen (+43%) and frontal cortex (+52%) in PD, normal in PSP, but decreased by 47% in putamen in MSA. The supersensitive dopamine D(1) receptors in both striatum and cerebral cortex in PD might compensate for dopamine deficiency, but could also contribute to long-term complications of levodopa therapy."
"We describe a consanguineous Indian family having spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) expansions with complex phenotypes (early-onset, dopa-responsive parkinsonism, ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa). The two probands having homozygous SCA2 mutations presenting with early-onset dopa-responsive parkinsonism without ataxia develop dyskinesias within a year of starting levodopa. Their siblings, heterozygous for SCA2 mutations, had retinitis pigmentosa with or without ataxia. Approximately 38% of family members with SCA2 mutations were asymptomatic."
"A chromosomal translocation t(18;21)(q23;q22) is reported in a patient with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We exclude the physical involvement and silencing of the ALS-linked gene for copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) on chromosome 21q22.1. The breakpoints are assigned to sequences flanked by the markers ATA1H06, D18S462, D21S1915, and D21S1898. These critical regions may contain susceptibility loci for FTD associated with ALS."
"Slow-channel syndrome (SCS) is a progressive neuromuscular disorder caused by abnormal gating of mutant acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). The pathological hallmark is selective degeneration of the NMJ termed endplate myopathy. Endplate myopathy consists of a combination of ultrastructural abnormalities, including degenerating subsynaptic nuclei, mitochondria, and postsynaptic folds, caused by localized cation overload through mutant AChRs. Because some of these changes resemble those seen in programmed cell death, we evaluated SCS muscle for evidence of focal activation of apoptotic pathways. Using antisera specific for the activated forms of caspases, the family of cysteine proteases that underlies apoptosis, we demonstrated that active forms of initiator and effector caspases are selectively localized at the NMJ in SCS. In comparison with an electron microscopic assessment of the abnormalities seen in endplate myopathy, we found that activated caspases were present at between 15 and 57% of endplates, similar to the proportion of endplates with degenerating mitochondria or vacuoles. This greatly exceeds the number of NMJs exhibiting nuclear degeneration. These findings provide the first evidence supporting the view that caspase activation in human disease can play a prominent role in localized cellular degenerative processes without causing nuclear or cell death."
"We report a homozygous case of spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 with 48 glutamines. The age of the patient at disease onset was not lower than those of heterozygotes with the same CAG-repeat sizes, but the clinical manifestations were rapidly progressive dementia and chorea. Neuronal loss was relatively restricted and most prominent in the Purkinje cell layer and striatum; however, intranuclear neuronal polyglutamine accumulation was widespread, with a high frequency in the cerebral cortex and striatum."
"We performed a comprehensive cognitive, neuroimaging, and genetic study of 31 patients with primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a decline in language functions that remains isolated for at least 2 years. Detailed speech and language evaluation was used to identify three different clinical variants: nonfluent progressive aphasia (NFPA; n = 11), semantic dementia (SD; n = 10), and a third variant termed logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA; n = 10). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) on MRIs showed that, when all 31 PPA patients were analyzed together, the left perisylvian region and the anterior temporal lobes were atrophied. However, when each clinical variant was considered separately, distinctive patterns emerged: (1) NFPA, characterized by apraxia of speech and deficits in processing complex syntax, was associated with left inferior frontal and insular atrophy; (2) SD, characterized by fluent speech and semantic memory deficits, was associated with anterior temporal damage; and (3) LPA, characterized by slow speech and impaired syntactic comprehension and naming, showed atrophy in the left posterior temporal cortex and inferior parietal lobule. Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 haplotype frequency was 20% in NFPA, 0% in SD, and 67% in LPA. Cognitive, genetic, and anatomical features indicate that different PPA clinical variants may correspond to different underlying pathological processes."
"A primary haplotype (H1) of the microtubule-associated protein Tau (MAPT) gene is associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the mechanism for disease susceptibility remains unknown. We examined the promoter region of MAPT and identified single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertions of 1 to 11 nucleotides. These polymorphisms corresponded to the previously characterized haplotypes, H1 and H2, as well as a novel variant of the H1 haplotype, H1'. As observed in other studies, we demonstrated a significant association with the H1/H1 promoter genotype and PD in a cohort of 206 idiopathic late-onset cases. This is in contrast with a panel of 13 early-onset PD patients, for whom we did not detect any mutations in MAPT. By examining single nucleotide polymorphisms in adjacent genes, we showed that linkage disequilibrium does not extend beyond the MAPT haplotype to neighboring genes. To define the mechanism of disease susceptibility, we examined the transcriptional activity of the promoter haplotypes using a luciferase reporter assay. We demonstrated in two human cell lines, SK-N-MC and 293, that the H1 haplotype was more efficient at driving gene expression than the H2 haplotype. Our data suggest that an increase in expression of the MAPT gene is a susceptibility factor in idiopathic PD."
"A drastic decrease in incidence has been observed for most human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related opportunistic manifestations after use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We assessed the trend of incidence of central nervous system (CNS) diseases in a prospective multicenter observational study involving 9,803 patients across Europe in the period 1994 to 2002 and analyzed patient and treatment variables associated with these conditions. Overall, 568 patients (5.8%) received a diagnosis of a new CNS disease. Incidence decreased significantly from 5.9 per 100 person-year in 1994 to 0.5 in 2002. Overall, the decrease was 40% per calendar year, and it was similar to that of non-CNS diseases and less evident after year 1998. In multivariable models, low CD4 cell count and high plasma viral load, but not HAART or calendar year, were significantly associated with risk to develop CNS disease, indicating that the effect of HAART was likely mediated by both improved immunological conditions and inhibition of viral replication. In contrast, use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, irrespective of use of protease inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, appeared to protect specifically against acquired immunodeficiency disease syndrome dementia complex, suggesting that, in this condition, therapy might have a direct, additive effect in the CNS."
"Infection by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) often results in neurological dysfunction including HIV dementia (HIVD). Alterations in cytokine and redox balance are thought to play important roles in the pathogenesis of HIVD, but the specific mechanisms underlying neuronal dysfunction and death are unknown. Activation of cytokine receptors and oxidative stress can induce the production of ceramide from membrane sphingomyelin, and recent findings suggest that ceramide is an important mediator of a form of programmed cell death called apoptosis. We now report that levels of ceramide, sphingomyelin, and hydroxynonenal (HNE) are significantly increased in brain tissues and cerebrospinal fluid of HIVD patients. Exposure of cultured neurons to the neurotoxic HIV proteins gp120 and Tat resulted in increased cellular levels of sphingomyelin, ceramide, and HNE. The ceramide precursor palmitoyl-CoA sensitized neurons to Tat and gp120 toxicity, whereas an inhibitor of ceramide production reduced Tat and gp120-induced increases of ceramide and HNE and protected the neurons from Tat and gp120-induced death. These results suggest that HIV-1 infection may promote a lipid imbalance in neural cells, resulting in an overproduction of ceramide and consequent cellular dysfunction and death."
"A time course study that examined the effects of the female estrous cycle on the chronic slow spike-and-wave discharges (SSWDs), gamma-aminobutyric B receptor (GABA(B)R) binding, and GABA(B)R protein expression was conducted in Long Evans hooded rats treated during development with a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor AY9944 (AY). In addition, a pharmacological study using the hormones progesterone, 17 beta-estradiol, mifepristone (intracellular progesterone receptor antagonist), tamoxifen (intracellular estrogen receptor antagonist), and allopregnanolone (progesterone metabolite) was performed to determine their effects on AY-induced seizures. The data indicate that there is a significant increase in both the duration of SSWD and GABA(B)R binding in the AY model, during the proestrus stage of the estrous cycle, the stage during which the levels of progesterone are at their highest. No changes in GABA(B)R1a or R2 protein levels were observed. In addition, the administration of both progesterone and allopregnanolone exacerbated seizures in the AY model, whereas 17 beta-estradiol attenuated the SSWD duration. Neither mifepristone nor tamoxifen blocked the effects of progesterone and 17 beta-estradiol, respectively, on SSWD duration in the AY model, suggesting that these two sex hormones are working in a manner independent of their intracellular receptors. These data suggest an important role for steroid hormones in the regulation and maintenance of AY-induced atypical absence seizures."
"Stiff-Man syndrome (SMS) is a rare disease of the central nervous system characterized by chronic muscle rigidity and autoimmunity directed against synaptic antigens. In a subset of patients, generally positive for antiamphiphysin autoantibodies, SMS has an autoimmune paraneoplastic origin. Amphiphysin isoforms are expressed at high levels in brain and skeletal muscle and often are overexpressed in breast cancer. We report here the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis in a patient with SMS, breast cancer, and antibodies that recognize both brain and muscle amphiphysin isoforms. Immunotherapy induced a remission of both rhabdomyolysis and SMS symptoms. Autoimmune rhabdomyolysis may represent a paraneoplastic complication of cancer patients with amphiphysin autoimmunity."
"Recently, it was suggested that the intensity of restless legs syndrome (RLS) symptoms may be modulated by a circadian factor. The objective of this study was to evaluate, during a 28-hour modified constant routine, the nycthemeral or circadian variations in subjective leg discomfort and periodic leg movements (PLMs) and to parallel these changes with those of subjective vigilance, core body temperature, and salivary melatonin. Seven patients with primary RLS and seven healthy subjects matched for sex and age entered this study. Although the symptoms were more severe in patients than in controls, a significant circadian variation in leg discomfort and PLM (p &lt; 0.01) was found for both groups. In both groups, the profiles of leg discomfort and PLM were significantly correlated with those of subjective vigilance, core body temperature, and salivary melatonin. However, among these variables, the changes in melatonin secretion were the only ones that preceded the increase in sensory and motor symptoms in RLS patients. This result and those of others studies showing that melatonin exerts an inhibitory effect on central dopamine secretion suggest that melatonin might be implicated in the worsening of RLS symptoms in the evening and during the night."
"Although memory deficits have been clearly documented in patients with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection, the physiological basis of this dysfunction is poorly understood. We focused on Tat, a viral protein released from HIV-1-infected cells and investigated its effect on spatial learning in adult mice. An intracerebroventricular injection of Tat leads to attenuation of spatial learning accompanied by suppression of long-term potentiation (LTP), the cellular basis of spatial learning, in hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 pyramidal neurons. Tat facilitates extrasynaptic but not synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that the Tat pathway underlies the development of memory dysfunction in patients with HIV-1 infection and suggest a causal relationship between Tat, the facilitation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptor activity, inhibition of LTP, and attenuation of spatial learning."
"Genomic triplication of the alpha-synuclein gene recently has been associated with familial Parkinson's disease in the Spellman-Muenter kindred. Here, we present an independent family, of Swedish-American descent, with hereditary early-onset parkinsonism with dementia due to alpha-synuclein triplication. Brain tissue available from affected individuals in both kindreds provided the opportunity to compare their clinical, pathological, and biochemical phenotypes. Of note, studies of brain mRNA and soluble protein levels demonstrate a doubling of alpha-synuclein expression, consistent with molecular genetic data. Pathologically, cornu ammonis 2/3 hippocampal neuronal loss appears to be a defining feature of this form of inherited parkinsonism. The profound implications of alpha-synuclein overexpression for idiopathic synucleinopathies are discussed."
"In patients with chronic stroke, the primary motor cortex of the intact hemisphere (M1(intact hemisphere)) may influence functional recovery, possibly through transcallosal effects exerted over M1 in the lesioned hemisphere (M1(lesioned hemisphere)). Here, we studied interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) between M1(intact hemisphere) and M1(lesioned hemisphere) in the process of generation of a voluntary movement by the paretic hand in patients with chronic subcortical stroke and in healthy volunteers. IHI was evaluated in both hands preceding the onset of unilateral voluntary index finger movements (paretic hand in patients, right hand in controls) in a simple reaction time paradigm. IHI at rest and shortly after the Go signal were comparable in patients and controls. Closer to movement onset, IHI targeting the moving index finger turned into facilitation in controls but remained deep in patients, a finding that correlated with poor motor performance. These results document an abnormally high interhemispheric inhibitory drive from M1(intact hemisphere) to M1(lesioned hemisphere) in the process of generation of a voluntary movement by the paretic hand. It is conceivable that this abnormality could adversely influence motor recovery in some patients with subcortical stroke, an interpretation consistent with models of interhemispheric competition in motor and sensory systems."
"In autosomal dominant acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ADANE), apparently healthy children develop necrotizing lesions in their thalami and brainstems in the course of febrile illnesses. We used DNA from affected subjects and obligate carriers to map ADANE to a 6.5Mb region on chromosome 2. Sequencing of four candidate genes in the interval (BCL2L11, ST6GalII, CHT1, and FLJ20019), involved in apoptosis, viral recognition, choline transport, and electron transport, showed no disease causing mutations."
"Increased neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia suggests that functional recovery after stroke may be attributed, in part, to neural regeneration. In this study, we investigated the role of neurogenesis in the behavioral performance of gerbils after cerebral global ischemia. We used ionizing radiation to decrease neural regeneration, and 2 weeks later cerebral global ischemia was induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. One month after the occlusion, the animals were behaviorally tested. Irradiation alone reduced neurogenesis but did not change vascular or dendritic morphology at the time of behavioral testing. Neither did irradiation, ischemia, or combined treatment impair rotor-rod performance or alter open-field activity. Gerbils subjected to both irradiation and ischemia demonstrated impaired performance in the water-maze task, compared with those that received only ischemia, radiation, or no treatment. These impairments after cerebral global ischemia under conditions of reduced neurogenesis support a role for the production of new cells in mediating functional recovery."
"We studied a patient with right parietal damage for whom tactile stimuli on the right/ipsilesional hand (projecting to the intact left hemisphere) were extinguished from awareness during double simultaneous stimulation, when his right hand was positioned in the left/contralesional space. This demonstrates the role of an egocentric spatial reference frame in attention that can determine awareness of stimuli despite intact sensory pathways. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging to elucidate the neural correlates of such perceptual extinction, we found that limb position modulated neural responses to tactile stimuli at early cortical stages (SI) in the intact hemisphere. Activity in bilateral middle frontal gyri also was modulated by limb position and may contribute to integrate sensory inputs into a supramodal, egocentric representation of space."
"Female SJL/J mice, suffering from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), were injected with 1 x 10(7) cells from a syngeneic fibroblast line transduced with a retroviral vector designed to encode proteolipid protein (101-157) targeted for secretion. A striking abrogation of both clinical and histological signs of disease resulted. The treatment was efficacious when given after the first or the third relapses, protected naive mice from challenge with spinal cord homogenate, and was dose dependent. This strategy was devised to provide a systemic, antigen-specific signal to pathogenic T cells in the absence of costimulation and, hence, render them anergic. Cytokine analyses of brain and spinal cord lymphocytes demonstrate that the treatment induces an antiinflammatory Th2 profile, indicating that this antigen-specific therapy acts by a cytokine-induced pathway. This study was designed for translation to the clinic. We envision using allogeneic transduced fibroblasts, encapsulated in a chamber, to deliver the antigen-specific signal. This will enable us to use one therapeutic cell line for all patients and to remove the device should the therapy exacerbate disease."
"Chronic reflex sympathetic dystrophy is a painful, disabling disorder for which no treatment with proven effect is available. We performed a randomized trial in a 2 to 1 ratio of patients, in which 36 patients were treated with spinal cord stimulation and physical therapy (SCS+PT), and 18 patients received solely PT. Twenty-four SCS+PT patients were given a permanent spinal cord stimulation system after successful test stimulation; the remaining 12 patients received no permanent system. We assessed pain intensity, global perceived effect, functional status, and health-related quality of life. Patients were examined before randomization, before implantation, and also at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months thereafter. At 2 years, three patients were excluded from the analysis. The intention-to-treat analysis showed improvements in the SCS+PT group concerning pain intensity (-2.1 vs 0.0 cm; p &lt; 0.001) and global perceived effect (43% vs 6% ""much improved""; p = 0.001). There was no clinically important improvement of functional status. Health-related quality of life improved only in the group receiving spinal cord stimulation. After careful selection and successful test stimulation, spinal cord stimulation results in a long-term pain reduction and health-related quality of life improvement in chronic reflex sympathetic dystrophy."
The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between the amygdala and human sex drive. We compared amygdalar volume in groups of patients with or without sexual changes after temporal lobe resection and in age-matched neurologically normal subjects. Forty-five patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent surgical resection in the Comprehensive Epilepsy Program at the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre completed a semistructured interview and questionnaire relating to sexual outcome after surgery. Volumetric analyses of both amygdalae were conducted on the patients' preoperative T(1)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans and those of 46 neurologically normal controls. Patients who reported a postoperative sexual increase had a significantly larger amygdalar volume contralateral to the site of their resective surgery than patients with a sexual decrease or no change than control subjects. There was a significant positive relationship between contralateral amygdalar volume and the maximum degree of sexual change. We have demonstrated a relationship between contralateral amygdalar volume and sexual outcome in patients undergoing temporal lobe resection. This finding provides evidence for an important role of the amygdala in regulating human sexual behavior. A larger contralateral amygdala may contribute to the expression of increased or improved sexuality after temporal lobe resection.
"Although genetic effects are known to be important for early onset Alzheimer's disease, little is known about the importance of genetic effects for late-onset disease. Furthermore, previous studies are based on prevalent cases. Our purpose was to characterize the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors for incident Alzheimer's disease late in life, and to test for differences in the importance of genetic effects at different ages. A cohort of 662 pairs of Swedish twins 52 to 98 years of age who were without symptoms of dementia was followed up for an average of 5 years. Incident dementia cases were detected through follow-up at 2 to 3-year intervals using either cognitive testing or telephone screening followed by dementia workups. A physician, psychologist, and nurse gave consensus diagnoses. During the follow-up period, 5.8% of the sample was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Average age of onset was 83.9 years (standard deviation, 6.3). Of the 26 monozygotic pairs in which at least one twin developed Alzheimer's disease, 5 were concordant (probandwise concordance, 32.2%). The concordance rate for dizygotic pairs was 8.7% (2 of 44 pairs). Structural model fitting indicated that 48% of the variation in liability to Alzheimer's disease could be attributed to genetic variation. Estimates did not differ significantly between twins younger than age 80 years and those older than age 80 years at baseline. Although these genetic estimates for incident disease are lower than those for prevalent disease, the importance of genetic factors for liability to Alzheimer's disease is considerable even late in life."
"Experimental and human data suggest programmed (active) cell death may contribute to the progressive hippocampal atrophy seen in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. Death-associated protein (DAP) kinase is a novel calcium/calmodulin-activated kinase that functions in apoptosis mediated by death receptors. Because seizure-induced neuronal death involves both death receptor activation and calcium, we examined DAP kinase expression, localization, and interactions in hippocampal resections from patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (n = 10) and autopsy controls (n = 6). Expression and phosphorylation of DAP kinase was significantly increased in epilepsy brain compared with control. DAP kinase and DAP kinase-interacting protein 1 (DIP-1) localized to mitochondria in control brain, whereas levels of both were increased in the cytoplasm and microsomal (endoplasmic reticulum) fraction in epilepsy samples. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed increased DAP kinase binding to calmodulin, DIP-1, and the Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) in epilepsy samples. Finally, immunohistochemistry determined DAP kinase was coexpressed with DIP-1 in neurons. This study provides the first description of DAP kinase and DIP-1 in human brain and suggests DAP kinase is a novel molecular regulator of neuronal death in epilepsy."
"Functional studies suggest that up to 95% of all glutamate transport is handled by the glutamate transporter EAAT2. Amino and C-terminal antibodies demonstrate that under normal conditions EAAT2 is specific to astrocytes. A truncated splice variant of EAAT2, known as EAAT2b, also has been identified in astrocytes and some neurons. In vitro studies suggest EAAT2b transports glutamate similar to EAAT2, although the contribution of EAAT2b to normal clearance of extracellular glutamate is unknown. To investigate EAAT2b biology in pathological conditions, we examined the cellular and regional distribution of EAAT2b in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Using epitope-specific, affinity purified antibodies, we found that EAAT2b tissue levels were increased by more than twofold in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis motor cortex, whereas EAAT2 levels were decreased by up to 95%. EAAT2b distribution in normal human cortex was largely confined to the neuropil-like EAAT2, with occasional faint neuronal expression. In contrast, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis motor cortex had an obvious qualitative increase in neuropil EAAT2b staining and a drastic increase in neuronal soma and dendritic EAAT2b immunostaining. Despite these increases in EAAT2b immunostaining, functional transporter studies demonstrated a large loss of EAAT2 function. These studies clearly document altered regulation and splicing of the dominant glutamate transporter EAAT2 under conditions of neurological stress."
"We have defined the genetic defect in a large family first described in one of the earliest reports of suspected mitochondrial myopathy, as the mutation T14709C in the mitochondrial transfer RNA(Glu) (mt-tRNA(Glu)) gene. Extraordinarily, this mutation has attained homoplasmy (100% mutated mt-tRNA(Glu)) on at least three independent occasions in this family and has done so in one individual who remains asymptomatic with no clinical evidence of disease. Heteroplasmy (dual populations of mutated and wild-type mtDNA) usually is regarded as one of the primary diagnostic criteria for pathogenicity and previous reports of the T14709C mutation detail heteroplasmy in a variety of tissues. In contrast, homoplasmy of mt-tRNA mutations generally has been regarded as evidence of a benign nature, with rare exceptions that result in organ-specific phenotypes. Discovering that T14709C, a common and severe mt-tRNA mutation, can attain homoplasmy without symptoms or clinical signs of disease has profound implications for the identification and prevalence of other pathogenic mt-tRNA mutations. Furthermore, variation in phenotype between homoplasmic individuals implies a crucial contribution from the nuclear genetic environment in determining the clinical outcome of mt-tRNA mutations."
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system disease with an unpredictable course and outcome. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are involved in the disease pathogenesis and induce active demyelination. Using oligonucleotide microarrays, we identified a statistically significant transcriptional signature of 1,109 genes in PBMCs from 26 MS patients, irrespective of disease activation state or immunomodulatory treatment. This signature contains genes that implicate underlying processes involved in MS pathogenesis including T-cell activation and expansion, inflammation, and apoptosis. Another transcriptional signature of 721 genes involved in cellular recruitment, epitope spreading, and escape from regulatory immune surveillance identified MS patients in acute relapse compared with remission. Our results offer new opportunity for understanding the mechanisms involved in MS and indicate that gene expression patterns in PBMCs contain information about a remote-target disease process that may be useful for diagnosis and future tailoring of therapeutic strategies for MS."
"This report describes the first human study of a novel amyloid-imaging positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, termed Pittsburgh Compound-B (PIB), in 16 patients with diagnosed mild AD and 9 controls. Compared with controls, AD patients typically showed marked retention of PIB in areas of association cortex known to contain large amounts of amyloid deposits in AD. In the AD patient group, PIB retention was increased most prominently in frontal cortex (1.94-fold, p = 0.0001). Large increases also were observed in parietal (1.71-fold, p = 0.0002), temporal (1.52-fold, p = 0.002), and occipital (1.54-fold, p = 0.002) cortex and the striatum (1.76-fold, p = 0.0001). PIB retention was equivalent in AD patients and controls in areas known to be relatively unaffected by amyloid deposition (such as subcortical white matter, pons, and cerebellum). Studies in three young (21 years) and six older healthy controls (69.5 +/- 11 years) showed low PIB retention in cortical areas and no significant group differences between young and older controls. In cortical areas, PIB retention correlated inversely with cerebral glucose metabolism determined with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. This relationship was most robust in the parietal cortex (r = -0.72; p = 0.0001). The results suggest that PET imaging with the novel tracer, PIB, can provide quantitative information on amyloid deposits in living subjects."
"The study describes the clinical and pathological findings in 12 patients with relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis, who died during or shortly after the onset of a relapse. Pathological changes not previously associated with the formation of new symptomatic lesions were observed in seven cases, namely, extensive oligodendrocyte apoptosis and microglial activation in myelinated tissue containing few or no lymphocytes or myelin phagocytes. No current laboratory model of multiple sclerosis, in particular, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, is known with these features, which raises the possibility of some novel process underlying new lesion formation in multiple sclerosis."
"The reported inverse association between the S18Y variant of the ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) gene and Parkinson's disease (PD) has strong biological plausibility. If confirmed, genetic association of this variant with PD may support molecular targeting of the UCHL1 gene and its product as a therapeutic strategy for PD. In this light, we performed a collaborative pooled analysis of individual-level data from all 11 published studies of the UCHL1 S18Y gene variant and PD. There were 1,970 cases and 2,224 unrelated controls. We found a statistically significant inverse association of S18Y with PD. Carriers of the variant allele (Y/Y plus Y/S vs S/S) had an odds ratio (OR) of 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-0.95) and homozygotes for the variant allele (Y/Y vs S/S plus Y/S) had an OR of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.57-0.88). There was a linear trend in the log OR consistent with a gene dose effect (p = 0.01). The inverse association was most apparent for young cases compared with young controls. There was no evidence for publication bias and the associations remained significant after excluding the first published, hypothesis-generating study. These findings confirm that UCHL1 is a susceptibility gene for PD and a potential target for disease-modifying therapies."
"Cervical myelopathy is a common cause of neurological disability among the elderly; however, the exact mechanism for the insidious and progressive deterioration remains to be elucidated. To study the pathophysiology, we developed a simple experimental model reproducing the course. In rats, a thin sheet of expanding polymer was implanted microsurgically underneath the C5-C6 laminae. In the control group, the polymer sheet was removed immediately. Changes in motor functions were monitored for 25 weeks after the operation, with voluntary exercise activity measured by odometer attached to revolving cages, and forced running capability measured by duration of exercise on a rotating treadmill. Motor neurons were counted stereologically in continuous sections. In the compression group, the forced running capability deteriorated after a latent period of 17 weeks and progressively thereafter. In the control group, it stayed unchanged throughout 25 weeks. Course of the voluntary exercise was comparable between the groups. Motor neuron density in the compression group decreased significantly in 9 weeks (-20.3%) and 25 weeks (-35.5%), but not in 1 or 3 weeks. This practical model properly reproduces characteristic features of the clinical cervical myelopathy, with progressive motor disturbance after a latency and insidious neuronal loss preceding the symptoms."
"Pompe's disease is an autosomal recessive myopathy. The characteristic lysosomal storage of glycogen is caused by acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency. Patients with late-onset Pompe's disease present with progressive muscle weakness also affecting pulmonary function. In search of a treatment, we investigated the feasibility of enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human alpha-glucosidase from rabbit milk. Three patients (aged 11, 16, and 32 years) were enrolled in the study. They were all wheelchair-bound and two of them were ventilator dependent with a history of deteriorating pulmonary function. After 3 years of treatment with weekly infusions of alpha-glucosidase, the patients had stabilized pulmonary function and reported less fatigue. The youngest and least affected patient showed an impressive improvement of skeletal muscle strength and function. After 72 weeks of treatment, he could walk without support and finally abandoned his wheelchair. Our findings demonstrate that recombinant human alpha-glucosidase from rabbit milk has a therapeutic effect in late-onset Pompe's disease. There is good reason to continue the development of enzyme replacement therapy for Pompe's disease and to explore further the production of human therapeutic proteins in the milk of mammals."
"We sought to determine whether medullary serotonergic neurons were affected in multiple system atrophy (MSA). Immunostaining for tryptophan hydroxylase was performed on serial 50 microm sections of the medulla of brains obtained at autopsy from six control subjects, eight subjects with clinical diagnosis of MSA, and four with Parkinson's disease. There was a severe depletion of serotonergic neurons in the nucleus raphe magnus, raphe obscurus, raphe pallidus, and ventrolateral medulla in MSA. Depletion of serotonergic neurons may contribute to impaired control of sympathetic outflow and other abnormalities in MSA."
"Apolipoprotein E (APOE)-epsilon4 has been associated with an unfavorable course of multiple sclerosis (MS). The mechanisms responsible for this are unclear, although cross-sectional MRI demonstrated a higher extent of ""black holes"" (BHs) in such patients. Here, we have studied the impact of the APOE genotype on both the longitudinal evolution of focal (BH ratio) and global (brain volume change [BVC]) brain tissue damage. Ninety-nine MS patients underwent ApoE genotyping, clinical examination, and magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and after 2.7 +/- 1.1 years to assess lesion load (LL) and BVC. In APOE-epsilon4 patients, the annual reduction in brain volume was fivefold higher (-0.65 +/- 0.61%) than in those without APOE-epsilon4 (-0.13 +/- 0.36%; p = 0.0001). At baseline, T(2) LL and T(1) LL were non-significantly higher in epsilon4 carriers, despite a shorter disease duration and absence of significant clinical differences. During follow-up, T(1) LL increased from 1.2 +/- 2.3 ccm to 1.7 +/- 2.7 ccm in the epsilon4 group, although T(2) LL did not change, leading to a significantly higher increase in the BH ratio [(T(1) LL/T(2) LL) x 100] from 5.5 to 12.4% (p = 0.005). BH ratio remained almost constant in non-epsilon4 patients (5.0 vs 5.7%). Accelerated brain tissue loss and a higher proportion of lesions evolving into BH therefore provide magnetic resonance imaging evidence for more pronounced tissue destruction in MS patients with APOE-epsilon4."
"We recently reported mutations in the sodium channel gene SCN2A in two families with benign familial neonatal-infantile seizures (BFNISs). Here, we aimed to refine the molecular-clinical correlation of SCN2A mutations in early childhood epilepsies. SCN2A was analyzed in 2 families with probable BFNIS, 9 with possible BFNIS, 10 with benign familial infantile seizures, and in 93 additional families with various early childhood epilepsies. Mutations effecting changes in conserved amino acids were found in two of two probable BFNIS families, in four of nine possible BFNIS families, and in none of the others. Our eight families had six different SCN2A mutations; one mutation (R1319Q) occurred in three families. BFNIS is an autosomal dominant disorder presenting between day 2 and 7 months (mean, 11.2 +/- 9.2 weeks) with afebrile secondarily generalized partial seizures; neonatal seizures were not seen in all families. The frequency of seizures varied; some individuals had only a few attacks without treatment and others had clusters of many per day. Febrile seizures were rare. All cases remitted by 12 months. Ictal recordings in four subjects showed onset in the posterior quadrants. SCN2A mutations appear specific for BFNIS; the disorder can now be strongly suspected clinically and the families can be given an excellent prognosis."
"A landmark of corticostriatal connectivity in nonhuman primates is that cortical connections are organized into a set of discrete circuits. Each circuit is assumed to perform distinct behavioral functions. In animals, most connectivity studies are performed using invasive tracing methods, which are nonapplicable in humans. To test the proposal that corticostriatal connections are organized as multiple circuits in humans, we used diffusion tensor imaging axonal tracking, a new magnetic resonance technique that allows demonstration of fiber tracts in a noninvasive manner. Diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber tracking showed that the posterior (sensorimotor), anterior (associative), and ventral (limbic) compartments of the human striatum have specific connections with the cortex, and particularly the frontal lobes. These results provide the first direct demonstration of distinct corticostriatal connections in humans."
"Subjects with Asperger's syndrome (AS) are impaired in social interaction and imitation, but the underlying brain mechanisms are poorly understood. Because the mirror-neuron system (MNS) that matches observed and executed actions has been suggested to play an important role in imitation and in reading of other people's intentions, we assessed MNS functions in 8 adult AS subjects and in 10 healthy control subjects during imitation of still pictures of lip forms. In the control subjects, cortical activation progressed in 30 to 80-millisecond steps from the occipital cortex to the superior temporal sulcus, to the inferior parietal lobe, and to the inferior frontal lobe, and finally, 75 to 90 milliseconds later, to the primary motor cortex of both hemispheres. Similar activation sites were found in AS subjects but with slightly larger scatter. Activation of the inferior frontal lobe was delayed by 45 to 60 milliseconds and activations in the inferior frontal lobe and in the primary motor cortex were weaker than in control subjects. The observed abnormal premotor and motor processing could account for a part of imitation and social impairments in subjects with AS."
"Increased brain volume in autism appears to be driven mainly by an unexplained white matter enlargement, and we have reported a similar phenomenon in developmental language disorder (DLD). Localization of this enlargement would strongly guide research into its cause, tissue basis, and functional implications. We utilized a white matter parcellation technique that divides cerebral white matter into an outer zone containing the radiate compartment and an inner zone containing sagittal and bridging system compartments. In both high-functioning autism and DLD, enlargement localized to the radiate white matter (all lobes in autism, all but parietal in DLD), whereas inner zone white matter compartments showed no volume differences from controls. Furthermore, in both autism and DLD, later or longer-myelinating regions showed greater volume increases over controls. Neither group showed cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, or internal capsule volume differences from control. Radiate white matter myelinates later than deep white matter; this pattern of enlargement thus is consistent with striking postnatal head circumference percentile increases reported in autism. These findings suggest an ongoing postnatal process in both autism and DLD that is probably intrinsic to white matter, that primarily affects intrahemispheric and corticocortical connections, and that places these two disorders on the same spectrum."
"Neuronal damage during acute viral encephalomyelitis can result directly from virus infection or indirectly from the host immune response to infection. In neurodegenerative diseases and stroke, neuronal death also can result from excess release of excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters, such as glutamate. To determine the role of glutamate excitotoxicity in fatal alphavirus-induced paralytic encephalomyelitis, we treated mice infected with neuroadapted Sindbis virus (NSV) with antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) subtypes of glutamate receptors. Both apoptotic and necrotic neurons in the hippocampus were decreased in animals treated with MK-801, an NMDA receptor antagonist, or GYKI-52466, an AMPA receptor antagonist. However, only AMPA receptor blockade prevented damage to spinal cord motor neurons and protected mice from paralysis and death due to NSV infection. Protection was not caused by altered virus replication because treatment did not affect virus distribution and actually delayed virus clearance. These results provide evidence that NSV infection activates neurotoxic pathways that result in aberrant glutamate receptor stimulation and neuronal damage. Furthermore, AMPA receptor-mediated motor neuron death is an important contributor to paralysis and mortality in acute alphavirus-induced encephalomyelitis."
"Currently, definite peripheral markers for the in vivo diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) are not available. Here, we report the presence of pathological prion protein in the olfactory mucosa of a case with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Prion protein immunoreactivity was detected in an olfactory biopsy performed 45 days after the disease onset, suggesting that the involvement of olfactory epithelium is an early event in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."
"Axonal degeneration is a major cause of permanent neurological deficit in multiple sclerosis (MS), but no current therapies for the disease are known to be effective at axonal protection. Here, we examine the ability of a sodium channel-blocking agent, flecainide, to reduce axonal degeneration in an experimental model of MS, chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (CR-EAE). Rats with CR-EAE were treated with flecainide or vehicle from either 3 days before or 7 days after inoculation (dpi) until termination of the experiment at 28 to 30 dpi. Morphometric examination of neurofilament-labeled axons in the spinal cord of CR-EAE animals showed that both flecainide treatment regimens resulted in significantly higher numbers of axons surviving the disease (83 and 98% of normal) compared with controls (62% of normal). These findings indicate that flecainide and similar agents may provide a novel therapy aimed at axonal protection in MS and other neuroinflammatory disorders."
"Wilson's disease results from mutations in the P-type Cu(2+)-ATPase causing Cu(2+) toxicity. We previously demonstrated that exposure of mixed neuronal/glial cultures to 20 microM Cu(2+) induced ATP loss and death that were attenuated by mitochondrial substrates, activators, and cofactors. Here, we show differential cellular sensitivity to Cu(2+) that was equalized to 5 microM in the presence of the copper exchanger/ionophore, disulfiram. Because Cu(2+) facilitates formation of oxygen radicals (ROS) which inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH), we hypothesized that their inhibition contributed to Cu(2+)-induced death. Toxic CU(2+) exposure was accompanied by early inhibition of neuronal and hepatocellular PDH and KGDH activities, followed by reduced mitochondrial transmembrane potential, DeltaPsi(M). Thiamine (1-6 mM), and dihydrolipoic acid (LA, 50 microM), required cofactors for PDH and KGDH, attenuated this enzymatic inhibition and subsequent death in all cell types. Furthermore, liver PDH and KGDH activities were reduced in the Atp7b mouse model of Wilson's disease prior to liver damage, and were partially restored by oral thiamine supplementation. These data support our hypothesis that Cu(2+)-induced ROS may inhibit PDH and KGDH resulting in neuronal and hepatocellular death. Therefore, thiamine or lipoic acid may constitute potential therapeutic agents for Wilson's disease."
"There are no known anatomical connections between neurons that innervate homologous right and left body parts. Nevertheless, some patients develop bilateral abnormalities after unilateral injury, a phenomenon often unrecognized and not yet characterized. Therefore, we examined in rats the effects of ligating and cutting one tibial nerve on sensory function and on density of innervation in hind paws contralaterally as well as ipsilaterally to the injury, at times between 1 day and 5 months after surgery. Punches removed from tibial- or sural-innervated planter paw skin were immunolabeled to quantitate epidermal nerve endings. Naive and sham-operated rats provided controls. Axotomized rats had near-total loss of PGP9.5(+) innervation within ipsilateral tibial-innervated skin at all time-points. Adjacent ipsilateral sural-innervated skin had persistent hyperalgesia without denervation, and robust axonal sprouting at 5 months after surgery. Contralesional hind paws lost 54% of innervation in tibial-innervated epidermis starting 1 week after surgery and persisting throughout. Contralesional sural-innervated skin had neither neurite loss nor sprouting. These results imply that unilateral nerve injury can cause profound, long lasting, nerve-branch-specific loss of distal innervation contralaterally as well as ipsilaterally. They discredit the practice of using tissues contralateral to an injury to provide normative controls and suggest the possibility of rapid, transmedian postinjury signals between homologous mirror-image neurons."
"It is unclear how immune cells traffic between the lymphoid compartment and the central nervous system (CNS), which lacks lymphatic vessels and is shielded by the blood-brain barrier. We studied the expression of CCR7, a chemokine receptor required for migration of T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) to lymphoid organs, in the CNS of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) to gain insight into pathways for CNS immune cell trafficking. Inflamed MS lesions contained numerous CCR7+ myeloid cells expressing major histocompatibility complex class II, CD68 and CD86, consistent with maturing DCs. CCR7+ DCs also were identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These observations suggested that the afferent limb of CNS immunity is comprised, in part, of DCs, which are generated within the CNS and migrate to deep cervical lymph nodes through the CSF after antigen capture. Ninety percent of CSF T cells expressed CCR7 and CSF from patients with MS was relatively depleted of CCR7-negative effector-memory T cells. In contrast, all T cells in parenchymal MS lesions lacked CCR7, indicating local retention and differentiation of central-memory T cells upon restimulation by antigen within the CNS. These data suggested that the efferent limb of CNS immunity is executed by central-memory T cells, which enter CSF directly from the circulation."
"Lacunar brain infarcts and cerebral white matter lesions are frequently observed on magnetic resonance imaging scans in elderly subjects. These lesions are also frequent in patient with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. We examined whether plasma amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) levels are associated with lacunar infarcts and white matter lesions in the general population, and whether the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype modifies these associations. We studied 1,077 participants within the population-based Rotterdam Scan Study, who were 60 to 90 years of age and free of dementia. Cross-sectional associations were analyzed by regression models with adjustments for age, sex, creatinine levels, and hypertension. In APOE epsilon4 carriers, plasma Abeta levels were positively associated with lacunar infarcts and white matter lesions, whereas in noncarriers no associations were observed. Per standard deviation increase in Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) levels the odds ratios for lacunar infarcts were 1.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22-2.43) and 1.93 (95% CI = 1.31-2.85), the periventricular white matter lesion grade increased by 0.32 (95% CI = 0.08-0.57) and 0.29 (95% CI = 0.00-0.57), and the subcortical white matter lesion volume increased by 0.48 ml (95% CI = 0.04-0.91) and 0.24 ml (95% CI = -0.27-0.75). Higher Abeta levels are associated with more lacunar infarcts and white matter lesions in elderly subjects who carry an APOE epsilon4 allele."
"We performed a case-control study of Parkinson's disease (PD) in a population characterized by a high prevalence of pesticide exposure and studied the joint effect of pesticide exposure and CYP2D6. Although they are based on a small group of subjects with the joint exposure, our findings are consistent with a gene-environment interaction disease model according to which (1) pesticides have a modest effect in subjects who are not CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, (2) pesticides' effect is increased in poor metabolizers (approximately twofold), and (3) poor metabolizers are not at increased PD risk in the absence of pesticide exposure."
"We report the translational readthrough levels induced by the aminoglycosides gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin, and paromomycin for eight premature stop codon mutations identified in Duchenne's and Becker's muscular dystrophy patients. In a transient transfection reporter assay, aminoglycoside treatment results show that one stop codon mutation is suppressed significantly better (up to 10% stop codon readthrough) than the others; five show lower but statistically significant suppression (&lt; 2% stop codon readthrough); and two appear refractory to aminoglycoside treatment. Readthrough levels do not substantially vary between different sources of gentamicin, and, for this set of mutations, the efficiency of termination at the premature stop codon mutation does not appear to correlate with disease severity."
"Degeneration of substantia nigra has been described in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). In this study, dopamine transporter (DAT) density with [123 I]FP-CIT SPECT was studied in six SCA2 patients with no parkinsonian signs, six Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, and six controls. Marked striatal DAT loss was found in both SCA2 and PD patients. However, a more severe reduction in the caudate and a higher putamen to caudate ratio distinguished SCA2 from PD patients, suggesting a more uniform nigrostriatal impairment in SCA2. Striatal DAT density of SCA2 patients correlated with the severity of cerebellar ataxia."
"We report three siblings, who were treated empirically with levodopa combined with carbidopa. There was an immediate therapeutic response. Biochemical investigation surprisingly showed the clinical phenotype to be caused by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency. Molecular characterization showed a homozygous point mutation (c.387 G--&gt;A) in exon 3. Kinetic studies showed the mutation to decrease the binding affinity for the substrate. This, combined with structural modeling suggesting alteration of active site configuration, provided an explanation for the therapeutic response to levodopa."
"Basis pontis lacunes cause contralateral but rarely ipsilateral ataxia. We explored this phenomenon with isotope tract tracing in the rhesus monkey. Labeled pontocerebellar fibers cross midline and disperse widely in the opposite hemipons before coalescing in the brachium pontis. This anatomical arrangement suggests that small pontine strokes spare sufficient decussating pontocerebellar fibers to prevent ipsilateral dysmetria, and that ipsilateral dysmetria after large pontine stroke represents a disconnection syndrome."
"Antibodies to rat muscle specific kinase, MuSK, have recently been identified in some generalized ""seronegative"" myasthenia gravis (SNMG) patients, who are often females with marked bulbar symptoms. Using immunoprecipitation of (125)I-labelled-human MuSK, 27 of 66 (41%) seronegative patients were positive, but 18 ocular SNMG patients, 105 AChR antibody positive MG patients, and 108 controls were negative. The antibodies are of high affinity (Kds around 100 pM) with titers between 1 and 200 nM. They bind to the extracellular Ig-like domains of soluble or native MuSK. Surprisingly they are predominantly in the IgG4 subclass. MuSK-antibody associated MG may be different in etiological and pathological mechanisms."
"Fatty acids are known to enhance mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP) activity. We asked whether a high-fat ketogenic diet (KD) increases UCP levels and activity in hippocampi of juvenile mice. Maximum mitochondrial respiration rates were significantly (p &lt; 0.001) higher in KD- versus standard diet (SD)-treated animals, indicating increased UCP-mediated proton conductance that can reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Western blots showed significant (p &lt; 0.05) or borderline significant increases in UCP2, UCP4, and UCP5 protein levels, and increased immunoreactivity to these three UCP isoforms was most prominently seen in the dentate gyrus of KD-fed mice. Finally, we found that oligomycin-induced ROS production was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower in KD-fed mice than in SD controls. Collectively, our data suggest that a KD may exert neuroprotective effects by diminishing ROS production through activation of mitochondrial UCPs."
"A functional --1021C --&gt; T polymorphism in the dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene has been demonstrated to regulate plasma DBH activity. We report that individuals with genetically determined low serum DBH activity (genotype T/T) have protection against Parkinson's disease (p = 0.01). In particular, we observed an underrepresentation of the T/T genotype odds ratio = 0.46 (CI = 0.27-0.8). Rather than identifying a haplotype, or a marker in linkage disequilibrium with the risk variant, this to our knowledge is the first report directly linking PD susceptibility with a proven functional variant."
"We examined the distribution of Pael-R, a newly identified substrate for Parkin, in Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Pael-R, Parkin, alpha-synuclein, and ubiquitin accumulated in Lewy bodies (LBs) and neurites. Pael-R was localized in the core of LBs. Parkin and alpha-synuclein accumulated in the halo, neuronal cell bodies, and processes. These findings potentially suggest the involvement of Pael-R in LB formation, and protection role of Parkin in Pael-R-mediated neurotoxicity in PD. The absence of Pael-R and Parkin in glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in MSA implies a distinct pathway involved in the formation of LBs and GCIs."
"Brain injury from inorganic Pb(2+) is considered the most important environmental childhood health hazard worldwide. The microvasculature of the developing brain is uniquely susceptible to high level Pb(2+) toxicity (ie, Pb(2+) encephalopathy) characterized by cerebellar hemorrhage, increased blood-brain barrier permeability, and vasogenic edema. However, the specific molecular mediators of Pb(2+) encephalopathy have been elusive. We found that Pb(2+) induces vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF) in cultured astrocytes (J Biol Chem, 2000;275:27874-27882). The study presented here asks if VEGF dysregulation contributes mechanistically to Pb(2+) encephalopathy. Neonatal rats exposed to 4% Pb-carbonate develop the histopathological features of Pb(2+) encephalopathy seen in children. Cerebellar VEGF expression increased approximately twofold (p &lt; 0.01) concurrent with the development of cerebellar microvascular hemorrhage, enhanced vascular permeability to serum albumin, and vasogenic cerebellar edema (p &lt; 0.01). No change in VEGF expression occurred in cerebral cortex that does not develop these histopathological complications of acute Pb(2+) intoxication. Pb(2+) exposure increased phosphorylation of cerebellar Flk-1 VEGF receptors and the Flk-1 inhibitor CEP-3967 completely blocked cerebellar edema formation without affecting microhemorrhage formation or blood-brain barrier permeability. This establishes that Pb(2+)-induced vasogenic edema formation develops via a Flk-1-dependent mechanism and suggests that the vascular permeability caused by Pb(2+) is Flk-1 independent."
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease with early lesions characterized by mononuclear cellular infiltrate, edema, demyelination, and axonal loss that contribute to the clinical course of the disease. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the mouse is a valuable model with a similar disease course to relapsing-remitting MS. The ability to detect the migration of encephalitogenic T cells into the central nervous system in EAE and MS would provide key information on these cells role in the development of lesions observed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). T cells were labeled for detection by magnetic resonance imaging using Food and Drug Administration-approved, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (Ferumoxides) complexed to poly-L-Lysine (FE-PLL). EAE was induced by adoptive transfer of either labeled or unlabeled T cells. After disease onset, FE-PLL-labeled T cells were detected in the mouse spinal cord using in vivo and ex vivo cellular MRI. Excellent correlation was seen between MRI-visible lesions in the spinal cord and histopathology. The results demonstrate that T cells labeled with FE-PLL can induce EAE disease and can be detected in vivo in the mouse model. The magnetic labeling of cells opens the possibility of monitoring specific cellular phenotypes or pharmacologically or genetically engineered cells by MRI."
"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was defined recently as another symptom of insulin resistance. Continuous therapy with valproate can result in increased body weight and insulin resistance, but no data are yet available on a possible relationship between valproate and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. We here demonstrate in abdominal ultrasound investigations that characteristics of fatty liver disease were present in 61% of valproate-treated patients as compared with 23% receiving carbamazepine therapy."
"We report that administration of paroxetine, a widely prescribed antidepressant drug that acts by inhibiting reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin, suppresses the neurodegenerative process and increases the survival of huntingtin mutant mice, an animal model of Huntington's disease (HD). Paroxetine attenuated motor dysfunction and body weight loss and improved glucose metabolism in the HD mice. Paroxetine was beneficial when treatment was initiated before or after the onset of motor dysfunction, suggesting a potential for such antidepressant drugs in the treatment of presymptomatic and symptomatic HD patients."
"The urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor (uPAR) play an important role in extracellular matrix degradation and cell migration in the central nervous system (CNS). To investigate the role of the uPA/uPAR system in the pathophysiology of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome dementia complex (ADC), we measured soluble uPAR (suPAR) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected patients and controls. CSF suPAR levels were significantly higher in HIV-1-infected patients than in controls and in patients with ADC or opportunistic CNS infections (CNS-OIs) than in neurologically asymptomatic patients, irrespective of HIV-1 disease stage. The highest levels of suPAR were found in patients with ADC, and among those with CNS-OIs in patients with cytomegalovirus encephalitis or cryptococcosis. Plasma suPAR levels were higher in HIV-1-infected patients than in controls and increased with HIV-1 disease stage regardless of the presence of CNS disease. In patients with ADC or CNS-OIs, CSF suPAR levels correlated with CSF HIV-1 RNA, but not with plasma suPAR concentrations. Highly active antiretroviral therapy was associated with a significant and parallel decrease of both CSF suPAR and HIV-1 RNA. In brain tissue from patients with HIV-1 encephalitis, uPAR was highly expressed by microglial and multinucleated giant cells staining positively for HIV-1. The overexpression of uPAR in the CNS of patients with ADC suggests that the uPA/uPAR system may contribute to the tissue injury and neuronal damage in this disease."
"Desmin-related myopathies (DRMs) are a heterogeneous group of muscle disorders, morphologically defined by intrasarcoplasmic aggregates of desmin. Mutations in the desmin and the alpha-B crystallin genes account for approximately one third of the DRM cases. The genetic basis of the other forms remain unknown, including the early-onset, recessive form with Mallory body-like inclusions (MB-DRMs), first described in five related German patients. Recently, we identified the selenoprotein N gene (SEPN1) as responsible for SEPN-related myopathy (SEPN-RM), a unique early-onset myopathy formerly divided in two different nosological categories: rigid spine muscular dystrophy and the severe form of classical multiminicore disease. The finding of Mallory body-like inclusions in two cases of genetically documented SEPN-RM led us to suspect a relationship between MB-DRM and SEPN1. In the original MB-DRM German family, we demonstrated a linkage of the disease to the SEPN1 locus (1p36), and subsequently a homozygous SEPN1 deletion (del 92 nucleotide -19/+73) in the affected patients. A comparative reevaluation showed that MB-DRM and SEPN-RM share identical clinical features. Therefore, we propose that MB-DRM should be categorized as SEPN-RM. These findings substantiate the molecular heterogeneity of DRM, expand the morphological spectrum of SEPN-RM, and implicate a necessary reassessment of the nosological boundaries in early-onset myopathies."
"The prostaglandin synthesizing enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has emerged as a critical pathogenic factor in brain diseases associated with activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, including stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the COX-2 reaction products responsible for these deleterious effects have not been identified. In particular, the relative contribution to the neurotoxicity of COX-2-derived prostanoids and reactive oxygen species has not been defined. We found that the brain damage produced by direct injection of NMDA into the somatosensory cortex is attenuated by the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 or in COX-2-null mice, but that the associated production of free radicals is not. Furthermore, COX-2 inhibition reduces the lesions even if the deleterious effects of free radicals are eliminated by the scavenger superoxide dismutase. The protection exerted by NS-398 is counteracted by a stable analog of prostaglandin E2. The findings directly implicate COX-2-derived prostanoids, rather then radicals, in the COX-2-dependent component of the damage mediated by NMDA receptors and strengthen the rationale for using COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of neurological diseases associated with glutamate neurotoxicity."
"Alpers' syndrome is a fatal neurogenetic disorder first described more than 70 years ago. It is an autosomal recessive, developmental mitochondrial DNA depletion disorder characterized by deficiency in mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) catalytic activity, refractory seizures, neurodegeneration, and liver disease. In two unrelated pedigrees of Alpers' syndrome, each affected child was found to carry a homozygous mutation in exon 17 of the POLG locus that led to a Glu873Stop mutation just upstream of the polymerase domain of the protein. In addition, each affected child was heterozygous for the G1681A mutation in exon 7 that led to an Ala467Thr substitution in POLG, within the linker region of the protein."
"Epileptic patients experienced an irreversible loss of their peripheral visual field upon treatment with vigabatrin (gamma-vinyl GABA), an inhibitor of the GABA degrading enzyme, GABA transaminase. Subsequently, central visual function was reported to also be irreversibly altered. This visual loss is associated with a decrease in the electroretinogram measurement localizing the deficit to the retina. To investigate its cellular origin, we treated rats daily with vigabatrin for 45 days. Two days after arresting this treatment, rats exhibited an irreversible decrease in the photopic electroretinogram, the flicker response, and the oscillatory potentials. These functional alterations were associated with a peripheral disorganization of the outer retina. However, photoreceptor damage was not limited to these disorganized areas, but cone inner and outer segments were severely injured in more central areas and their numbers were irreversibly decreased by 17 to 20%. Ultrastructural examination of the retina confirmed the presence of major photoreceptor damages, which were further supported by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and caspase-3 activation both indicative of photoreceptor apoptosis. This study suggests that the visual field loss in vigabatrin-treated epileptic patients may result from a sequence of events starting from cone cell injury to a more severe disorganization of the photoreceptor layer."
"Familial forms of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with tauopathy are mostly caused by mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT). However, rare forms of familial tauopathy without MAPT mutations have been reported, suggesting other tauopathy-related genetic defects. Interestingly, two presenilin 1 (PS1) mutations (Leu113Pro and insArg352) recently have been associated with familial FTD albeit without neuropathological confirmation. We report here a novel PS1 mutation in a patient with Pick-type tauopathy in the absence of extracellular beta-amyloid deposits. The mutation is predicted to substitute Gly--&gt;Val at codon position 183 (Gly183Val) and to affect the splice signal at the junction of the sixth exon and intron. Further clinical-genetic investigation showed a positive family history of FTD-like dementia and suggested that Gly183Val is associated with a phenotypically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder. Our results suggest PS1 as a candidate gene for Pick-type tauopathy without MAPT mutations."
"We used positron emission tomography (PET) with (+)-[(11)C]dihydrotetrabenazine ([+]-[(11)C]DTBZ) to examine striatal monoaminergic presynaptic terminal density in 20 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 25 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 19 normal elderly controls. Six DLB patients developed parkinsonism at least 1 year before dementia (DLB/PD) and 14 developed dementia before parkinsonism or at about the same time (DLB/AD). Striatal mean binding potential was decreased by 62 to 77% in the DLB/PD group and 45 to 67% in the DLB/AD compared to AD and control. Binding was lower in the DLB/PD group than the DLB/AD, but the differences reached only marginal significance in the caudate nucleus. No differences were found between AD and control groups though a few AD patients had binding values below the range of the controls. Subsequent neuropathological examination in one AD patient revealed both AD and DLB changes despite the absence of clinical parkinsonism. Both DLB groups had an anterior to posterior binding deficit gradient relative to controls, largest in posterior putamen, smaller in anterior putamen, smallest in caudate nucleus. The DLB/AD group showed significant binding asymmetry only in posterior putamen. We conclude that PET with (+)-[(11)C]DTBZ differentiates DLB from AD, and decreased binding in AD may indicate subclinical DLB pathology in addition to AD pathology."
"The dopamine transporter (DAT) may be the single most important determinant of extracellular dopamine concentrations. The importance of DAT in Parkinson's disease (PD) in which DAT may be reduced by 50 to 70% is unclear. We have examined the effects of methylphenidate (MPD), an inhibitor of DAT, administered alone or with levodopa, on parkinsonism measured with tapping and walking speeds, dyskinesia, subjective effects, and vital signs. MPD in oral doses of up to 0.4 mg/kg was well tolerated. Administered alone, MPD produced no objective improvement of parkinsonism. MPD, 0.4 mg/kg orally, coadministered with 2-hour levodopa infusions at 0.5 or 1.0mg/kg/hr increased the percentage of patients responding to the 0.5mg/kg/hr dose and prolonged the response to levodopa infusions as measured by tapping and walking speeds. Dyskinesia was prolonged in proportion to the increase in antiparkinson actions but severity was not increased. MPD decreased the hypotensive response to levodopa. In conclusion, MPD appeared to have no effect given alone but potentiated the effects of levodopa, particularly doses at threshold for clinical effects. These observations indicate that the residual DAT is functional in PD and is a potential target for symptomatic therapy of PD."
"The histogenetic origin and the basis of the distribution of central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene syndrome, VHL disease, are unknown. To better understand hemangioblastoma histogenesis, we analyzed postmortem CNS tissues from four patients with well-established diagnosis of VHL disease including development of characteristic tumors and positive family history. Numerous angiomesenchymal tumorlets, which resembled hemangioblastoma, but which also consistently showed distinct histological features, were distributed in the nerve roots, spinal cord, and cerebellum. Genetic analysis consistently showed deletion of the wild-type VHL allele in these tumorlets. Most angiomesenchymal tumorlets were in the dorsal nerve roots; the anterior roots and cerebellum were less frequently affected. Tumorlet distribution was highly consistent in the four cases. In analogy to the wide morphological spectrum of lesions known to exist in VHL kidneys, nerve roots appear to harbor more wide-spread and morphologically heterogeneous changes than previously appreciated. The abundance of tumorlets, associated with highly consistent morphology and topography, suggests a developmental origin of hemangioblastoma. Therefore, in VHL disease, inactivation of the VHL wild-type allele appears necessary, but not sufficient, for the formation of tumor that produces symptoms and neurological disability."
"We followed up 11 patients for up to 5 years after bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation for advanced Parkinson's disease. Dyskinesias remained significantly reduced until the last assessment. The initial improvement of off-period motor symptoms and fluctuations, however, was not sustained and gradually declined. Beneficial effects of pallidal deep brain stimulation on activities of daily living in the on- and off-period were lost after the first year. Replacement of pallidal electrodes into the subthalamic nucleus in four patients could restore the initial benefit of deep brain stimulation and allowed a significant reduction of dopaminergic drug therapy."
"A large body of research supports a multifactorial cause in multiple sclerosis (MS), with an underlying genetic susceptibility likely acting in concert with undefined environmental exposures. Here, we used a highly efficient multilocus genotyping assay to study single nucleotide polymorphisms representing variation in 34 genes from inflammatory pathways in a well-characterized MS familial data set. Evidence of transmission distortion was present for several polymorphisms. Results for the NOS2A locus (exon 10 C/T, D346D) on chromosome 17q11 remained significant after correction for multiple testing and were reproduced in a second independent African American MS data set. In addition, linkage to a NOS2A promoter region polymorphism, (CCTTT)(n), was present in a third data set of multicase MS families. Our results provide strong evidence for linkage and association to a new candidate disease gene on chromosome 17q11 in MS and suggest that variation within NOS2A or a nearby locus contributes to disease susceptibility."
"In the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), accumulation of the abnormal disease-specific prion protein is associated with neurodegeneration. Previous data suggested that abnormal prion protein (PrP) could induce neuronal pathology only when neurons expressed the normal form of PrP, but conflicting evidence also has been reported. Understanding whether neuronal PrP expression is required for TSE neuropathological damage in vivo is essential for determining the mechanism of TSE pathogenesis. Therefore, these experiments were designed to study scrapie pathogenesis in vivo in the absence of neuronal PrP expression. Hamster scrapie (strain 263K) was used to infect transgenic mice expressing hamster PrP in the brain only in astrocytes. These mice previously were shown to develop clinical scrapie, but it was unclear whether the brain pathology was caused by damage to astrocytes, neurons, or other cell types. In this electron microscopic study, neurons demonstrated TSE-specific pathology despite lacking PrP expression. Abnormal PrP was identified around astrocytes, primarily in the extracellular spaces of the neuropil, but astrocytes showed only reactive changes and no damage. Therefore, in this model the pathogenesis of the disease appeared to involve neuronal damage associated with extracellular astrocytic accumulation of abnormal PrP acting upon nearby PrP-negative neurons or triggering the release of non-PrP neurotoxic factors from astrocytes."
"Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 1C (CMT1C) is an autosomal dominant demyelinating peripheral neuropathy caused by missense mutations in the small integral membrane protein of lysosome/late endosome (SIMPLE) gene. To investigate the prevalence of SIMPLE mutations, we screened a cohort of 152 probands with various types of demyelinating or axonal and pure motor or sensory inherited neuropathies. SIMPLE mutations were found only in CMT1 patients, including one G112S and one W116G missense mutations. A novel I74I polymorphism was identified, yet no splicing defect of SIMPLE is likely. Haplotype analysis of STR markers and intragenic SNPs linked to the gene demonstrated that families with the same mutation are unlikely to be related. The clustering of the G112S, T115N, and W116G mutations within five amino acids suggests this domain may be critical to peripheral nerve myelination. Electrophysiological studies showed that CMT1C patients from six pedigrees (n = 38) had reduced nerve conduction velocities ranging from 7.5 to 27.0m/sec (peroneal). Two patients had temporal dispersion of nerve conduction and irregularity of conduction slowing, which is unusual for CMT1 patients. We report the expression of SIMPLE in various cell types of the sciatic nerve, including Schwann cells, the affected cell type in CMT1C."
We studied the clinical impact of neutralizing antibodies to botulinum toxin A that occurred during long-term treatment of children between 1993 and 2001. Antibodies were found in high titers in 35 of 110 (31.8%) samples from individual patients. Antibody formation correlated with secondary nonresponse (p &lt; 0.001). The most significant risk factors for antibody formation were the frequency of treatments (p = 0.0001) and the injection of a higher weight-adapted maximum dose per treatment (p = 0.001).
"After stroke, the pattern of brain activation during performance of a motor task is related to outcome. Here, we compare this relationship in the early (10-14 days) and late (at least 3 months) phases after first-ever stroke. A negative linear relationship between task-related brain activation, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging, and outcome is seen in several identical primary and nonprimary motor regions that is independent of time after stroke. In other words, patients with poorer outcome scores recruit more widely within motor-related regions in both the early or late poststroke phase. However, in contralesional middle intraparietal sulcus, contralesional cerebellum, and ipsilesional rostral premotor cortex, this relationship is seen only in the early poststroke phase. Thus, patients with poorer outcome scores recruit these areas in only the early and not the late poststroke phase. These results suggest that there are differences in the cerebral implementation of action in patients with poor outcome that are dependent on the time since stroke. Thus, in those patients with the most to gain from rehabilitation, different therapeutic approaches may be required at different stages after stroke."
"The cholinergic denervation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) provides the rationale for treatments with anticholinesterases. The presence of this cholinergic lesion is solidly established in advanced AD. Whether it also exists in early disease remains unsettled. This question was addressed with thioflavin-S histofluorescence to identify neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and two tau antibodies (AT8, Alz-50) to identify pre-tangle cytopathology in the nucleus basalis, the source of cortical cholinergic innervation. Methods for the concurrent visualization of tauopathy and choline acetyltransferase were used to determine if the cytopathology was selectively located within cholinergic neurons. Five elderly index cases who had died at the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early AD were identified by longitudinal neuropsychological and behavioral assessments. They were compared to 7 age-matched cognitively normal subjects. NFT and AT8 (or Alz-50) immunostaining in cholinergic nucleus basalis neurons existed even in the cognitively normal subjects. The percentage of tauopathy-containing nucleus basalis neurons was greater in the cognitively impaired and showed a significant correlation with memory scores obtained 1-18 months prior to death. These results show that cytopathology in cortical cholinergic pathways is a very early event in the course of the continuum that leads from advanced age to MCI and AD."
"Increasing evidence points to synaptic plasticity impairment as one of the first events in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, studies on synaptic dysfunction in different transgenic AD models that overexpress familial AD mutant forms of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and/or presenilin (PS) have provided conflicting results. Both long-term potentiation (LTP) and basal synaptic transmission (BST) have been found to be both unchanged and altered in different models and under differing experimental conditions. Because of their more robust amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition, double transgenic mice currently are used by several laboratories as an AD model. Here, we report that mice overexpressing APP (K670N:M671L) together with PS1 (M146L) have abnormal LTP as early as 3 months of age. Interestingly, reduced LTP paralleled plaque appearance and increased Abeta levels and abnormal short-term memory (working memory). BST and long-term memory (reference memory) are impaired only later (approximately 6 months) as amyloid burden increases. Abeta pathology across different ages did not correlate with synaptic and cognitive deficits, suggesting that Abeta levels are not a marker of memory decline. In contrast, progression of LTP impairment correlated with the deterioration of working memory, suggesting that percentage of potentiation might be an indicator of the cognitive decline and disease progression in the APP/PS1 mice."
"Twenty-one children and young adults with sickle/beta-thalassemia without overt stroke were examined with magnetic resonance imaging and angiography (MRA), transcranial Doppler (TCD), visual (VEP) and median nerve somatosensory (SEP)-evoked potential recordings, and neuropsychological testing (Wechsler Intelligence Scale [WISC-III]). Eight (38%) had silent infarction in the parietooccipital cortex, deep white matter, or basal ganglia, including two of three with previous seizures. Of 17 undergoing TCD, none had maximum middle cerebral artery (MCA) velocities greater than 126cm/sec, but 9 were abnormal, with low velocities and difficulty in tracking the MCA and/or asymmetry. Three patients had abnormal MRA, one of whom also had silent infarction. One patient had pathological VEP recordings, whereas all SEP recordings were normal. WISC-III was performed in all 11 children, 4 with silent infarction: all but 1 had IQ scores greater than 85 (mean, 97.7; standard deviation, 14.2). We conclude that Greek children and young adults with Sbeta-thalassemia and no history of clinical stroke have TCD abnormalities and silent infarction similar to those reported in children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia, but cognitive function is not necessarily compromised. International collaboration is needed to establish the risk factors for central nervous system sequelae in patients with sickle cell disease, including Sbeta-thalassemia, leading to evidence-based prevention."
"Cerebral lateralization may be important in neural control of immune function. Animal studies have demonstrated differential effects of left and right brain lesions on immune function, but human studies are inconclusive. Here, we show that resections in the language dominant hemisphere of patients with epilepsy reduce lymphocytes, total T cells, and helper T cells. In contrast, resections in the language nondominant hemisphere increased the same cellular elements. T-cell responses to mitogens and microbial antigens were not differentially affected. Left/right arm histamine skin response ratios were altered in patients with left cerebral epileptic focus, and flare skin responses were reduced by left cerebral resections in contrast with an increase after right cerebral resections. The findings demonstrate a differential role of the left and right cerebral hemispheres on immune functions in humans."
"Autosomal dominant facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD1A) is associated with contractions of the polymorphic D4Z4 repeat array on chromosome 4qter. The disease has a high frequency of new mutations of mitotic origin. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-based studies show that mitotic mutations leading to somatic mosaicism occur equally frequently in patients and parents. Nevertheless, somatic mosaicism in FSHD is mainly reported in asymptomatic parents by applying standard Southern analysis after linear gel electrophoresis. Explaining this apparent discrepancy, we here demonstrate that somatic mosaicism in FSHD patients goes largely undetected using the standard diagnostic technique, indicating that linear electrophoresis is unsuitable to identify mosaic patients. As a consequence, the phenotype of mosaic patient's offspring will be underestimated, whereas the recurrence risk in the symptomatic mosaic individuals will be overestimated. Moreover, somatic mosaicism may partly explain the observation of anticipation in de novo kindreds. Therefore, clinicians should always consider pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis in de novo FSHD families, in particular when the patient's phenotype is much milder than expected based on D4Z4 length proper."
"Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is an mRNA surveillance system that eliminates aberrant mRNAs containing premature translation termination codons (PTCs). We evaluated the role of NMD in of Ullrich's disease. The patient has a frameshift mutation with a PTC in the collagen VI alpha2 gene causing the loss of collagen VI and functional defects in extracellular matrix (ECM). The pharmacological block of NMD caused upregulation of the mutant collagen VI alpha2 subunit, resulting in collagen VI assembly and partially functional ECM formation. Our results suggest that NMD inhibitors can be used as a therapeutic tool to rescue some human genetic diseases exacerbated by NMD."
"Although previous studies of focal hand dystonia have detected cortical sensorimotor abnormalities, little is known about the role of the basal ganglia in this disorder. We report here that when focal hand dystonic patients performed finger-tapping tasks, functional magnetic resonance imaging showed persisting elevations of basal ganglia activity after the tasks ended. We posit that inhibitory control of the basal ganglia may be faulty in focal hand dystonia, and that the increases we observe in ""resting"" activity may mask basal ganglia abnormalities in standard imaging contrast analyses."
"Electrophysiological data in primates suggest that the superior parietal lobule integrates the position of the limbs to construct complex representations of postures. Although in humans the neural basis of these mechanisms remains largely unknown, neuropsychological studies have implicated left superior parietal regions. We devised a simple functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm aimed at exploring this hypothesis in healthy humans. Strong activation was obtained within the left but not the right superior parietal lobule, providing additional evidence that this structure may play a key role in body part localization processing."
"We performed a population-based clinical and molecular genetic study of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) in the northeast of England. The minimum point prevalence of SCA6 was 1.59 in 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.14), and the number of individuals who either had SCA6 or are at risk of developing SCA6 was at least 5.21 in 100,000 (95% CI, 4.31-6.10), or 1 in 19,210. Microsatellite analysis of the CACNA1A gene indicated a founder effect for SCA6 within this region."
"No consistent cerebral anatomical abnormality has ever been reported in primary focal hand dystonia (FHD). The present voxel-based morphometry study showed a significant bilateral increase in gray matter in the hand representation area of primary somatosensory and, to a lesser extent, primary motor cortices in 36 patients with unilateral FHD compared with 36 controls. The presence of anatomical changes in the perirolandic cortex for the unaffected hand as well as that for the affected hand suggests that these disturbances may be, at least in part, primary."
"The explanation for why some patients develop psychotic change in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear. ""Psychosis-modifier genes"" may act in the setting of neurodegeneration to produce AD plus psychosis in a similar way to how genetic modulation during neurodevelopment leads to schizophrenia. Because there is increasing interest in the common disruption of cytokine pathways seen in both AD and schizophrenia, we tested the association between the functional interleukin-1beta -511 promoter polymorphism with delusions and hallucinations in AD. Significant associations between psychotic symptoms and the CC genotype (p = 0.001 - p = 0.043) and C allele (p = 0.014 vs p = 0.048) were found, thus confirming the previously noted increased risk in schizophrenia."
"Evidence suggests early structural brain changes in individuals with the Huntington's disease (HD) genetic mutation who are presymptomatic for the movement symptoms of the illness. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of functional brain changes in this same population using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects and matched controls underwent an functional magnetic resonance imaging ""interference"" protocol, a task known to be mediated in part by corticostriatal circuitry. In the setting of normal cognitive performance, presymptomatic HD subjects had significantly and specifically less activation in the left anterior cingulate cortex (BA 24, 32) compared with matched controls."
"Unstable GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH) mutations in dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) can exert a dominant-negative effect in the HeLa cell model, but in a batch of cells this effect could not be shown. Through differential display, we found a higher Hsc70 expression in the non-dominant-negative cells. We further demonstrated that ectopic expression of Hsp40/Hsp70 stabilized the GCH mutant G201E. Moreover, Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin destroyed the wild-type GCH level, and heat shock increased the synthesis of GCH protein. Therefore, the dominant-negative effect produced by unstable proteins would be susceptible to the status of molecular chaperones, which could be the modifying genes and therapeutic targets for DRD and other genetic diseases."
"An inception cohort of 40 children and adolescents with traumatic brain injury and suspected diffuse axonal injury were studied using a new high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging susceptibility-weighted technique that is very sensitive for hemorrhage. A blinded comparison was performed between the extent of parenchymal hemorrhage and initial clinical variables as well as outcomes measured at 6 to 12 months after injury. Children with lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores (&lt; or =8, n = 30) or prolonged coma (&gt;4 days, n = 20) had a greater average number (p = 0.007) and volume (p = 0.008) of hemorrhagic lesions. Children with normal outcomes or mild disability (n = 30) at 6 to 12 months had, on average, fewer hemorrhagic lesions (p = 0.003) and lower volume (p = 0.003) of lesions than those who were moderately or severely disabled or in a vegetative state. Significant differences also were observed when comparing regional injury to clinical variables. Because susceptibility-weighted imaging is much more sensitive than conventional T2*-weighted gradient-echo sequences in detecting hemorrhagic diffuse axonal injury, more accurate and objective assessment of injury can be obtained early after insult, and may provide better prognostic information regarding duration of coma as well as long-term outcome."
"Penetrating cortical trauma frequently results in delayed development of epilepsy. In the rat undercut model of neocortical posttraumatic hyperexcitability, suppression of neuronal activity by exposing the injured cortex to tetrodotoxin (TTX) in vivo for approximately 2 weeks prevents the expression of abnormal hypersynchronous discharges in neocortical slices. We examined the relationship between neuronal activity during the latent period after trauma and subsequent expression of hyperexcitability by varying the timing of TTX treatment. Partially isolated islands of rat sensorimotor cortex were treated with Elvax polymer containing TTX to suppress cortical activity and slices obtained for in vitro experiments 10 to 15 days later. TTX treatment was either started immediately after injury and discontinued after a variable number of days or delayed for a variable time after the lesion was placed. Immediate treatment lasting only 2 to 3 days and treatment delayed up to 3 days prevented hyperexcitability. Thus, there is a critical period for development of hyperexcitability in this model that depends on cortical activity. We propose that the hyperexcitability caused by partial cortical isolation may represent an early stage of posttraumatic epileptogenesis. A hypothetical cascade of events leading to subsequent pathophysiological activity is likely initiated at the time of injury but remains plastic during this critical period."
"Dopamine is a potent modulator of learning and has been implicated in the encoding of stimulus salience. Repetition, however, as required for the acquisition and reacquisition of sensorimotor or cognitive skills (e.g., in aphasia therapy), decreases salience. We here tested whether increasing brain levels of dopamine during repetitive training improves learning success. Forty healthy humans took 100mg of the dopamine precursor levodopa or placebo daily for 5 days in a randomized double-blind and parallel-group design. Ninety minutes later on each day, subjects were trained on an artificial vocabulary using a high-frequency repetitive approach. Levodopa significantly enhanced the speed, overall success, and long-term retention of novel word learning in a dose-dependent manner. These findings indicate new ways to potentiate learning in a variety of domains if conventional training alone fails."
"Human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) and type II (HTLV-II) are closely related retroviruses with similar biological properties and common modes of transmission. HTLV-I infection is endemic in well-defined geographic regions, and it is estimated that some 20 million individuals are infected worldwide. Although most infected individuals are asymptomatic carriers, some 2 to 5% will develop a chronic encephalomyelopathy, HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). In contrast with HTLV-I, the role of HTLV-II in the development of neurological disorders is much less clear. HTLV-II is endemic in many native Amerindian groups and epidemic in injecting drug users (IDUs) worldwide. To evaluate the role of HTLV-II in neurological disease, we have critically reviewed all reported cases of HTLV-II-associated disorders. This has confirmed that although rare infection is associated with a disorder clinically similar or identical to HAM/TSP. However, most reports that have attributed infection to a range of other neurological disorders are difficult to evaluate in that in many cases either the association appears to be fortuitous or the presentations were confounded by a background of concomitant human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection and/or active IDU. In view of the many HTLV-II-infected individuals in urban areas of North America and Europe, neurologists should be aware of the potential clinical consequences of this infection."
"Human prion diseases can occur as an idiopathic disorder (sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) or can be acquired, as is the case for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. These disorders are characterized by the accumulation of a protease-resistant form of the host-encoded prion protein termed PrP(Sc) in the brains of affected individuals. PrP(Sc) has been proposed to be the principal, if not sole, component of the infectious agent, with its accumulation in the central nervous system the primary event leading to neurodegeneration. A major question remains as to whether self-propagating structural differences in PrP(Sc) might account for the clinicopathological diversity evident in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and whether different prion protein types underlie the existence of different strains of causative agent. Here, we describe the results of a large-scale biochemical study of PrP(Sc) from autopsy-proved cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (n = 59) and compare these with cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (n = 170) in the United Kingdom over the period 1991 to 2002. The results show PrP(Sc) in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease to be remarkably stereotyped. In contrast, considerable heterogeneity in PrP(Sc) exists both between and within cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."
"The neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) impairs mitochondrial respiration and damages dopaminergic neurons as seen in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we report that L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase type II/amyloid binding alcohol dehydrogenase (HADH II/ABAD), a mitochondrial oxidoreductase enzyme involved in neuronal survival, is downregulated in PD patients and in MPTP-intoxicated mice. We also show that transgenic mice with increased expression of human HADH II/ABAD are significantly more resistant to MPTP than their wild-type littermates. This effect appears to be mediated by overexpression of HADH II/ABAD mitigating MPTP-induced impairment of oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. This study demonstrates that HADH II/ABAD modulates MPTP neurotoxicity and suggests that HADH II/ABAD mimetics may provide protective benefit in the treatment of PD."
"Alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) is typically distinguished from familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) by infantile onset of the characteristic symptoms and high prevalence of associated neurological deficits that become increasingly obvious with age. Expansion of the clinical spectrum in FHM recently has begun to blur the distinction between these disorders. We report a novel ATP1A2 mutation in a kindred with features that bridge the phenotypic spectrum between AHC and FHM syndromes, supporting a possible common pathogenesis in a subset of such cases. Mutation analysis in classic sporadic AHC patients and in an additional five kindreds in which linkage to the ATP1A2 locus could not be excluded failed to identify additional mutations."
"Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder that arises because of mutations in the ATM gene. The 5762ins137 A--&gt;G point mutation activates a cryptic splice donor site resulting in a 137 bp intronic insert being aberrantly spliced into the ATM transcript. However, normal ATM transcript also is produced from this affected allele, albeit at significantly reduced levels. An exceptionally mild A-T phenotype occurs as a result of homozygosity for the 5762ins137 mutation because of relative preservation of ATM protein expression/kinase activity."
A new restless legs syndrome locus on chromosome 14 recently has been reported in one family of Italian origin. Our study aimed to replicate this finding and determine the importance of this locus in the French Canadian population. Markers spanning the region were genotyped in 14 large families and linkage assessed using two-point and multipoint logarithm of odds scores. Possible linkage to this locus was found in one of our kindreds providing support for the existence of this locus and indicating that this locus may be responsible for a small fraction of French Canadian restless legs syndrome.
"In Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) gene, there is a C/G polymorphism immediately after the CAG repeat; the expanded CAG repeat tract is exclusively followed by C, whereas about half of wild-type alleles are followed by G. Using this C/G polymorphism, we have engineered the small interfering RNA (siRNA) which decreased the expression of mutant ataxin-3, Q79C, by 96.0%, whereas there was minimal reduction on that of the wild type, Q22G (5.9%). Furthermore, unexpectedly, the expression of another wild-type allele, Q22C, was also much less suppressed (22.5%) by this siRNA possibly due to difference of the secondary structure of the target RNA. This is the first report of sequence-independent discrimination of mutant and wild-type alleles by siRNA."
"S100B is a glial-derived protein that is a well-established biomarker for severity of neurological injury and prognosis for recovery. Cell-based and clinical studies have implicated S100B in the initiation and maintenance of a pathological, glial-mediated proinflammatory state in the central nervous system. However, the relationship between S100B levels and susceptibility to neurological injury in vivo has not been determined. We used S100B transgenic (Tg) and knockout (KO) mice to test the hypothesis that overexpression of S100B increases vulnerability to cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury and that this response correlates with an increase in neuroinflammation from activated glia. Postnatal day 8 Tg mice subjected to hypoxia-ischemia showed a significant increase in mortality compared with KO and wild-type mice. Tg mice also exhibited greater cerebral injury and volume loss in the ischemic hemisphere after an 8-day recovery, as assessed by histopathology and magnetic resonance imaging. Measurement of glial fibrillary acidic protein and S100B levels showed a significant increase in the Tg mice, consistent with heightened glial activation and neuroinflammation in response to injury. This is the first demonstration to our knowledge that overexpression of S100B in vivo enhances pathological response to injury."
"A defect of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) interrupts heparan and dermatan sulfate degradation and causes neuropathology in children with severe forms of mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPSI, Hurler syndrome). Enzyme substitution therapy is beneficial but ineffective on the central nervous system. We could deliver the missing enzyme to virtually the entire brain of MPSI mice through a single injection of gene transfer vectors derived from adenoassociated virus serotype 2 (AAV2) or 5 (AAV5) coding for human IDUA. This result was reproducibly achieved with both vector types in 46 mice and persisted for at least 26 weeks. Success was more frequent, enzyme activity was higher, and corrected areas were broader with AAV5 than with AAV2 vectors. Treatment presumably reversed and certainly prevented the accumulation of GM2 and GM3 gangliosides, which presumably participates to neuropathology. Lysosomal distension, which already was present at the time of treatment, had disappeared from both brain hemispheres and was minimal in the cerebellum in mice analyzed 26 weeks after injection. This study shows that pathology associated with MPSI can be prevented in the entire mouse brain by a single AAV vector injection, providing a preliminary evaluation of the feasibility of gene therapy to stop neuropathology in Hurler syndrome."
"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) recently has been assessed as a noninvasive treatment modality for movement and psychiatric disorders, whereas the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects is not fully understood. Studies in rodents showed lasting functional changes in some selected regions, such as limbic-associated structures, but unfocused brain stimulation did not clarify the regional effects. To address the topographical and temporal profiles of the effects on glucose metabolism in primate brain, we performed rTMS and repeated (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) before, during, and up to 16 days after rTMS in anesthetized cynomologous monkeys. We delivered a total of 2,000 pulses of 5 Hz-rTMS over the right precentral gyrus using a small-sized eight-figured coil that induced a localized electrical field. Voxel-based analysis in a standard space of the macaque brain showed statistically robust changes in FDG uptake: a decrease in the motor/premotor cortices and an increase in the limbic-associated areas involving the anterior/posterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortices. Interestingly, these uptake changes continued for at least 8 days and the magnitude of the lasting effects in the limbic-related areas was negatively correlated across subjects with those in the motor/premotor cortices. The results demonstrate that motor rTMS has a long-term lasting effect on motor-related regions and distant limbic-related areas via functional connections."
"The CD19+ B-lymphocyte and CD138+ plasma cell repertoires in cerebrospinal fluid from four patients with monosymptomatic optic neuritis (ON) were analyzed by single-cell reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Amplified heavy (H)- and light (L)-chain antibody segments were sequenced and used to identify the rearranged germline and J segment of closest homology. Both the B-cell and plasma cell repertoires from ON cerebrospinal fluid demonstrated significant clonal expansion. Up to 75% of the amplified H- and L-chain sequences were contained in overrepresented populations and were somatically mutated, consistent with an antigen-targeted response. The relationship between clonal populations within the CD19+ B lymphocyte and CD138+ plasma cell populations suggests ongoing mutational pressure to refine antigen binding. Our observations demonstrate that an antigen-driven clonal B-lymphocyte and plasma cell response is prominent in the initial stages of central nervous system demyelination and suggest that detection of the disease-relevant antigens in ON may bear on the inciting antigens in chronic inflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis."
"Benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE) is considered to be a genetically determined idiopathic partial epilepsy. We studied twins with BRE and compared the concordance with a twin sample of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). All eight BRE pairs (six monozygous [MZ], two dizygous [DZ]) were discordant. MZ pairwise concordance was 0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0-0.4) for BRE compared with 0.7 (95% CI, 0.5-0.9) for 26 IGE MZ pairs. Our data suggest that conventional genetic influences in BRE are considerably less than for IGE, and other mechanisms need to be explored."
"The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been improved in recent decades with the incorporation of paraclinical investigations in diagnostic workup. In the last 15 years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an especially valuable tool for supporting MS diagnosis, and specific imaging criteria became fundamental to the guidelines for the diagnosis of MS published in 2001 by an international panel (IP). The new IP criteria include MRI evidence of dissemination in space and time, making it possible to diagnose MS after a single clinical episode. This review considers current evidence concerning the reliability of the new IP criteria for the diagnosis of relapsing-onset MS, discusses strengths and weaknesses of the criteria, and outlines areas which may need modification or should be the focus of future research directed toward improving diagnostic accuracy. It also makes practical recommendations when using MRI and the IP criteria in MS diagnosis, especially in patients with clinically isolated syndromes or atypical presentations. The IP criteria are timely and concrete and introduce an important concept to MS diagnosis. Future modifications, based on emerging evidence, should further facilitate their implementation and improve their accuracy."
"Nemaline myopathy (NM) is the most common of several congenital myopathies that present with skeletal muscle weakness and hypotonia. It is clinically heterogeneous and the diagnosis is confirmed by identification of nemaline bodies in affected muscles. The skeletal muscle alpha-actin gene (ACTA1) is one of five genes for thin filament proteins identified so far as responsible for different forms of NM. We have screened the ACTA1 gene in a cohort of 109 unrelated patients with NM. Here, we describe clinical and pathological features associated with 29 ACTA1 mutations found in 38 individuals from 28 families. Although ACTA1 mutations cause a remarkably heterogeneous range of phenotypes, they were preferentially associated with severe clinical presentations (p &lt; 0.0001). Most pathogenic ACTA1 mutations were missense changes with two instances of single base pair deletions. Most patients with ACTA1 mutations had no prior family history of neuromuscular disease (24/28). One severe case, caused by compound heterozygous recessive ACTA1 mutations, demonstrated increased alpha-cardiac actin expression, suggesting that cardiac actin might partially compensate for ACTA1 abnormalities in the fetal/neonatal period. This cohort also includes the first instance of an ACTA1 mutation manifesting with adult-onset disease and two pedigrees exhibiting potential incomplete penetrance. Overall, ACTA1 mutations are a common cause of NM, accounting for more than half of severe cases and 26% of all NM cases in this series."
"We describe a second large Italian kindred with autosomal dominant vacuolar myopathy characterized by variable severity, adult-onset weakness of distal limb muscles, and no cardiac involvement. At least 19 individuals over four generations are affected. Histopathological and immunochemical features of the vacuoles, present in many fibers, indicate protein degradation abnormalities with dysregulation of the lysosomal pathway and activation of the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. Linkage analysis localized the defect to the 19p13.3 locus in a region with no known genes. We speculate that the primary defect may be an abnormality in the lysosomal degradation pathway or related components."
"Olfactory dysfunction is an early and common symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). In an effort to determine whether otherwise unexplained (idiopathic) olfactory dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of developing PD, we designed a prospective study in a cohort of 361 asymptomatic relatives (parents, siblings, or children) of PD patients. A combination of olfactory detection, identification, and discrimination tasks was used to select groups of hyposmic (n = 40) and normosmic (n = 38) individuals for a 2-year clinical follow-up evaluation and sequential single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), using [123I]beta-CIT as a dopamine transporter ligand, to assess nigrostriatal dopaminergic function at baseline and 2 years from baseline. A validated questionnaire, sensitive to the presence of parkinsonism, was used in the follow-up of the remaining 283 relatives. Two years from baseline, 10% of the individuals with idiopathic hyposmia, who also had strongly reduced [123I]beta-CIT binding at baseline, had developed clinical PD as opposed to none of the other relatives in the cohort. In the remaining nonparkinsonian hyposmic relatives, the average rate of decline in dopamine transporter binding was significantly higher than in the normosmic relatives. These results indicate that idiopathic olfactory dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of developing PD of at least 10%."
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is accompanied by a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) leading to edema formation and aggravation of the disease. Interferon-beta (IFN-beta) has been approved for the treatment of MS and besides its immunomodulatory effects has been demonstrated to lead to a stabilization of BBB integrity in vivo. To investigate whether human recombinant IFN-beta exerts direct effects on the BBB, we used an in vitro BBB model in which brain endothelial cells in coculture with astrocytes form a tight permeability barrier for 3H-inulin and 14C-sucrose. Removal of the astrocytes from the coculture or alternatively addition of histamine resulted in an increased paracellular permeability for small tracers across the brain endothelial cell monolayer. Strikingly, in the presence of IFN-beta, permeability increase under both conditions was inhibited. Permeability changes were accompanied by minor changes in the staining for tight junction-associated proteins in brain endothelial cell monolayers. Taken together, our data demonstrate a direct stabilizing effect of IFN-beta on BBB cerebral endothelial cells in vitro that might significantly contribute to the beneficial effects of IFN-beta treatment in MS in vivo."
"Focal ischemia followed by reperfusion initiates a harmful P- and E-selectin-mediated recruitment of leukocytes in brain microvasculature. In this study, we tested whether a novel magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent (Gd-DTPA-sLe(x) A), which is designed to bind to activated endothelium could be detected by MR imaging (MRI) in a focal stroke mouse model. MRIs (9.4T) of the brain were acquired 24 hours after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. T1 maps were acquired repeatedly before and up to 1.5 hours after the intravenous injection of either Gd-DTPA or Gd-DTPA-sLe(x) A. Analysis of images included a pixel-by-pixel subtraction of T1 maps from the precontrast T1 maps and quantification of T1 within the ischemic area. After injection of Gd-DTPA-sLe(x) A, T1 decreased compared with precontrast levels, and an interhemispheric difference between the pre-post contrast T1 developed within the stroke lesion at a mean time of 52 minutes after injection (p &lt; 0.05). Animals injected with Gd-DTPA did not exhibit changes in T1 signal intensity between regions of the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, indicating that the reductions in T1 observed with Gd-DTPA-sLe(x) A were unrelated to blood-brain barrier breakdown. Fluorescent-labeled sLe(x) A administered intravenously was observed to bind to the endothelium of injured but not control brain. The study suggests that the contrast agent Gd-DTPA-sLe(x) A can be used to visualize early endothelial activation after transient focal ischemia in vivo with MRI."
"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to study memory-associated activation of medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions in 32 nondemented elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Subjects performed a visual encoding task during fMRI scanning and were tested for recognition of stimuli afterward. MTL regions of interest were identified from each individual's structural MRI, and activation was quantified within each region. Greater extent of activation within the hippocampal formation and parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) was correlated with better memory performance. There was, however, a paradoxical relationship between extent of activation and clinical status at both baseline and follow-up evaluations. Subjects with greater clinical impairment, based on the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes, recruited a larger extent of the right PHG during encoding, even after accounting for atrophy. Moreover, those who subsequently declined over the 2.5 years of clinical follow-up (44% of the subjects) activated a significantly greater extent of the right PHG during encoding, despite equivalent memory performance. We hypothesize that increased activation in MTL regions reflects a compensatory response to accumulating AD pathology and may serve as a marker for impending clinical decline."
"The presence of fast ripple oscillations (FRs, 200-500 Hz) has been confirmed in rodent epilepsy models but has not been observed in nonepileptic rodents, suggesting that FRs are associated with epileptogenesis. Although studies in human epileptic patients have reported that both FRs and ripples (80-200 Hz) chiefly occur during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), and that ripple oscillations in human hippocampus resemble those found in nonprimate slow wave sleep, quantitative studies of these oscillations previously have not been conducted during polysomnographically defined sleep and waking states. Spontaneous FRs and ripples were detected using automated computer techniques in patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy during sleep and waking, and results showed that the incidence of ripples, which are thought to represent normal activity in animal and human hippocampus, was similar between epileptogenic and nonepileptogenic temporal lobe, whereas rates of FR occurrence were significantly associated with epileptogenic areas. The generation of both FRs and ripples showed the highest rates of occurrence during NREM sleep. During REM sleep, ripple rates were lowest, whereas FR rates remained elevated and were equivalent to rates observed during waking. The predominance of FRs within the epileptogenic zone not only during NREM sleep, but also during epileptiform-suppressing desynchronized episodes of waking and REM sleep supports the view that FRs are the product of pathological neuronal hypersynchronization associated with seizure-generating areas."
"Fuel utilization in two adult patients with the myopathic form of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency and five healthy subjects was investigated with stable isotopes during exercise at 50% of VO2max. The findings indicate that residual VLCAD activity in the patients is sufficient to maintain normal oxidation of fat at rest, but that fat oxidation rate cannot increase above basal levels during exercise. This can cause an energy deficit and intramuscular accumulation of fat intermediates that may induce the exercise-induced symptoms."
"Episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by paroxysmal attacks of ataxia, vertigo, and nausea, typically lasting minutes to days in duration. These symptoms can be prevented or significantly attenuated by the oral administration of acetazolamide; however, the mechanism by which acetazolamide ameliorates EA2 symptoms is unknown. EA2 typically results from nonsense mutations in the CACNA1A gene that encodes the alpha1A (Cav2.1) subunit of the P/Q-type calcium (Ca2+) channel. We have identified a novel H1736L missense mutation in the CACNA1A gene associated with the EA2 phenotype. This mutation is localized near the pore-forming region of the P/Q-type Ca2+ channel. Functional analysis of P/Q-type channels containing the mutation show that the H1736L alteration affects several channel properties, including reduced current density, increased rate of inactivation, and a shift in the voltage dependence of activation to more positive values. Although these findings are consistent with an overall loss of P/Q-type channel function, the mutation also caused some biophysical changes consistent with a gain of function. We also tested the direct effect of acetazolamide on both wild-type and H1736L mutated P/Q-type channels and did not observe any direct action on channel properties of this pharmacological agent used to treat EA2 patients."
"In healthy volunteers, reduction of somatosensory input from one hand leads to rapid performance improvements in the other hand. Thus, it is possible that reduction of somatosensory input from the healthy hand can influence motor function in the paretic hand of chronic stroke patients with unilateral hand weakness. To test this hypothesis, we had 13 chronic stroke patients perform motor tasks with the paretic hand and arm during cutaneous anesthesia of the healthy hand and healthy foot in separate sessions. Performance of a finger tapping task, but not a wrist flexion task, improved significantly with anesthesia of the hand, but not the foot. This effect progressed with the duration of anesthesia and correlated with baseline motor function. We conclude that cutaneous anesthesia of the healthy hand elicits transient site-specific improvements in motor performance of the moderately paretic hand in patients with chronic stroke, consistent with interhemispheric competition models of sensorimotor processing."
"Muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB), is caused by mutations in the POMGnT1 gene. We describe a white family with two siblings affected with congenital hypotonia early-onset glaucoma, and psychomotor delays. Brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) showed hydrocephalus, bilateral frontal polymicrogyria, abnormal cerebellum, and characteristic flattened dystrophic pons. We identified novel POMGnT1 gene alterations in this family. Both affected siblings were found to be compound hetrozygotes and carried two missense changes inherited from their mother and one missense change (p.R442C) inherited from their father. Our findings further define the phenotypic spectrum of MEB and its occurrence in the US population."
"Immune responses against gangliosides are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of some variants of Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome (GBS). For example, IgG antibodies against GM1, GD1a, and related gangliosides are frequently present in patients with post-Campylobacter acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) variant of GBS, and immunization of rabbits with GM1 has produced a model of AMAN. However, the role of anti-ganglioside antibodies in GBS continues to be debated because of lack of a passive transfer model. We recently have raised several monoclonal IgG anti-ganglioside antibodies. We passively transfer these antibodies by intraperitoneal hybridoma implantation and by systemic administration of purified anti-ganglioside antibodies in mice. Approximately half the animals implanted with an intraperitoneal clone of anti-ganglioside antibody-secreting hybridoma developed a patchy, predominantly axonal neuropathy affecting a small proportion of nerve fibers. In contrast to hybridoma implantation, passive transfer with systemically administered anti-ganglioside antibodies did not cause nerve fiber degeneration despite high titre circulating antibodies. Blood-nerve barrier studies indicate that animals implanted with hybridoma had leaky blood-nerve barrier compared to mice that received systemically administered anti-ganglioside antibodies. Our findings suggest that in addition to circulating antibodies, factors such as antibody accessibility and nerve fiber resistance to antibody-mediated injury play a role in the development of neuropathy."
"Folic acid supplementation has proved to be extremely effective in reducing the occurrence of neural tube defects (NTDs) and other congenital abnormalities in humans, suggesting that folic acid can modulate key mechanisms for growth and differentiation in the central nervous system (CNS). To prevent NTDs, however, supplemental folate must be provided early in gestation. This suggests that the ability of folic acid to activate growth and differentiation mechanisms may be confined to the early embryonic period. Here, we show that folic acid can enhance growth and repair mechanisms even in the adult CNS. Using lesion models of CNS injury, we found that intraperitoneal treatment of adult rats with folic acid significantly improves the regrowth of sensory spinal axons into a grafted segment of peripheral nerve in vivo. Regrowth of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons into a similar graft also was enhanced, although to a smaller extent than spinal axons. Furthermore, folic acid supplementation enhances neurological recovery from a spinal cord contusion injury, showing its potential clinical impact. The results show that the effects of folic acid supplementation on CNS growth processes are not restricted to the embryonic period, but can also be effective for enhancing growth, repair, and recovery in the injured adult CNS."
"Mutations in genes encoding the NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase, complex I of the respiratory chain, cause a diverse group of diseases. They include Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, Leigh syndrome, and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes. There is no effective treatment for these or any other mitochondrial disorder. Using a unique animal model of severe complex I deficiency induced by ribozymes targeted against a critical complex I subunit gene (NDUFA1), we attempted rescue of the optic nerve degeneration associated with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. We used adenoassociated virus to deliver the human gene for SOD2 to the visual system of disease-induced mice. Relative to mock infection, SOD2 reduced apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells and degeneration of optic nerve fibers, the hallmarks of this disease. Rescue of this animal model supports a critical role for oxidative injury in disorders with complex I deficiency and shows that a respiratory deficit may be effectively treated in mammals, thus offering hope to patients."
"We tested the hypothesis that the DYT1 genotype is associated with a disorder of anatomical connectivity involving primarily the sensorimotor cortex. We used diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) to assess the microstructure of white matter pathways in mutation carriers and control subjects. Fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of axonal integrity and coherence, was reduced (p &lt; 0.005) in the subgyral white matter of the sensorimotor cortex of DYT1 carriers. Abnormal anatomical connectivity of the supplementary motor area may contribute to the susceptibility of DYT1 carriers to develop clinical manifestations of dystonia."
"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) are sporadic neurodegenerative diseases presenting as atypical parkinsonian disorders, characterized by the presence of tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles. Recently, an extended haplotype (H1E) of 787.6 kb that comprises several genes including MAPT showed increased association with PSP. The objective of this study was to determine the size of the H1E haplotype associated with PSP and CBD in different populations and to identify specific subhaplotypes in the background of H1E haplotype. Nineteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 17q21 region were genotyped in two case-control samples. The SNPs that were associated with higher risk for the disease in the homozygous state delimit a region of more that 1 Mb. Haplotype analyses in the Spanish sample showed that the most frequent haplotype found among the patients (H1E'), which extends 1.04 Mb and contains several genes such as MAPT, CRHR1, IMP5, Saitohin, WTN3, and NSF. A specific subhaplotype (H1E'A) was present in 16% of PSP patients but was not observed in the controls. Furthermore, the H2E'A haplotype, was rarely present in the disease group suggesting that it plays a protective role. The identification of these specific subhaplotypes that modify risk for PSP/CBD supports the hypothesis that a pathogenic allele exists in a subgroup of PSP patients."
"Recent studies suggest that the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase, COX-2, promotes motor neuron loss in rodent models of ALS. We investigated the effects of PGE2, a principal downstream prostaglandin product of COX-2 activity, on motor neuron survival in an organotypic culture model of ALS. We find that PGE2 paradoxically protects motor neurons at physiological concentrations in this model. PGE2 exerts its downstream effects by signaling through a class of four distinct G-protein-coupled E-prostanoid receptors (EP1-EP4) that have divergent effects on cAMP. EP2 and EP3 are dominantly expressed in ventral spinal cord in neurons and astrocytes, and activation of these receptor subtypes individually or in combination also rescued motor neurons. The EP2 receptor is positively coupled to cAMP, and its neuroprotection was mimicked by application of forskolin and blocked by inhibition of PKA, suggesting that its protective effect is mediated by downstream effects of cAMP. Conversely, the EP3 receptor is negatively coupled to cAMP, and its neuroprotective effect was blocked by pertussis toxin, suggesting that its protective effect is dependent on Gi-coupled heterotrimeric signaling. Taken together, these data demonstrate an unexpected neuroprotective effect mediated by PGE2, in which activation of its EP2 and EP3 receptors protected motor neurons from chronic glutamate toxicity."
"Bilateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) was performed in a patient with Huntington's disease (HD) with severe chorea. Stimulation at 40 and 130 Hz improved chorea. Stimulation at 130 Hz slightly worsened bradykinesia overall, whereas 40 Hz had little effect. A [15O] H2O positron emission tomography showed increased regional cerebral blood flow in motor decision making and execution areas more evident at 40 Hz. Adjustment of stimulation parameters in GPi DBS may have the potential to optimize the motor response in HD, improving chorea without aggravating bradykinesia."
"This study was initiated to investigate prothrombotic risk factors in children with porencephaly. 76 porencephalic and 76 healthy infants were investigated for factor V (FV) G1691A mutation, factor II G20210A variant, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T genotype, lipoprotein (a), protein C, protein S, and antithrombin. Only the FV mutation (p = 0.005) and combinations of two or three different risk factors (p = 0.003) were significantly associated with porencephaly. These data give evidence that the FV G1691A mutation and a combination of prothromboic factors play a major role in the development of childhood porencephaly."
"Neurotoxicity of anticancer agents complicates treatment of children with cancer. We investigated neurotoxic effects of common cytotoxic drugs in neuronal cultures and in the developing rat brain. When neurons were exposed to cisplatin (5-100 microM), cyclophosphamide (5-100 microM), methotrexate (5-100 microM), vinblastin (0.1-1 microM), or thiotepa (5-100 microM), a concentration-dependent neurotoxic effect was observed. Neurotoxicity was potentiated by nontoxic glutamate concentrations. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist MK 801 (10 microM), the AMPA receptor antagonists GYKI 52466 (10 microM) and NBQX (10 microM), and the pancaspase inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (1 nM) ameliorated neurotoxicity of cytotoxic drugs. To investigate neurotoxicity in vivo, we administered to 7-day-old rats the following: cisplatin (5-15 mg/kg i.p.), cyclophosphamide (200-600 mg/kg i.p.), thiotepa (15-45 mg/kg), or ifosfamide (100-500 mg/kg) and their brains were analyzed at 4 to 24 hours. Cytotoxic drugs produced widespread lesions within cortex, thalamus, hippocampal dentate gyrus, and caudate nucleus in a dose-dependent fashion. Early histological analysis demonstrated dendritic swelling and relative preservation of axonal terminals, which are morphological features indicating excitotoxicity. After longer survival periods, degenerating neurons displayed morphological features consistent with active cell death. These results demonstrate that anticancer drugs are potent neurotoxins in vitro and in vivo; they activate excitotoxic mechanisms but also trigger active neuronal death."
"Environmental toxins have been implicated in the etiology of Parkinson's disease. Recent findings of defects in the ubiquitin-proteasome system in hereditary and sporadic forms of the illness suggest that environmental proteasome inhibitors are candidate PD-inducing toxins. Here, we systemically injected six doses of naturally occurring (epoxomicin) or synthetic (Z-lle-Glu(OtBu)-Ala-Leu-al [PSI]) proteasome inhibitors into adult rats over a period of 2 weeks. After a latency of 1 to 2 weeks, animals developed progressive parkinsonism with bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and an abnormal posture, which improved with apomorphine treatment. Positron emission tomography demonstrated reduced carbon-11-labeled 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane (CFT) binding to dopaminergic nerve terminals in the striatum, indicative of degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway. Postmortem analyses showed striatal dopamine depletion and dopaminergic cell death with apoptosis and inflammation in the substantia nigra pars compacta. In addition, neurodegeneration occurred in the locus coeruleus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and the nucleus basalis of Meynert. At neurodegenerative sites, intracytoplasmic, eosinophilic, alpha-synuclein/ubiquitin-containing, inclusions resembling Lewy bodies were present in some of the remaining neurons. This animal model induced by proteasome inhibitors closely recapitulates key features of PD and may be valuable in studying etiopathogenic mechanisms and putative neuroprotective therapies for the illness."
"We describe the ninth variant of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) or Batten disease, due to defects in a putative new gene, CLN9. We therefore refer to the new variant as CLN9-deficient. Two Serbian sisters and two German brothers are described. Their clinical history is characteristic for juvenile NCL. They show similar gene expression patterns. The existence of this variant is supported by the presence of curvilinear inclusions, fingerprint profiles, and granular osmiophilic deposits in neurons, lymphocytes, and conjunctival cells. Enzyme screening and sequencing of the coding regions of other NCL genes was negative. CLN9-deficient cells have a distinctive phenotype. They have rounded cell bodies, have prominent nucleoli, attach poorly to the culture dish, and are sensitive to apoptosis but have increased growth rates. Gene expression of proteins involved in cell adhesion and apoptosis is altered in these cells. Sphingolipid metabolism is also perturbed. They have decreased levels of ceramide, sphingomyelin, lactosylceramide, ceramide trihexoside, and globoside and increased activity of serine palmitoyl transferase."
"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients commonly have attention and concentration problems. However, it remains unclear how HIV infection affects the attention network. Therefore, blood oxygenation level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) was performed in 36 subjects (18 HIV and 18 seronegative [SN] controls) during a set of visual attention tasks with increasing levels of attentional load. Compared with SN controls, HIV subjects showed similar task performance (accuracies and reaction times) but decreased activation in the normal visual attention network (dorsal parietal, bilateral prefrontal, and cerebellar regions) and increased activation in adjacent or contralateral brain regions. Cognitive performance (assessed with NPZ-8), CD4, and viral load all correlated with activated BOLD signals in brain regions that activated more in HIV subjects. Furthermore, HIV subjects activated more than SN controls in brain regions that showed load-dependent increase in activation (right prefrontal and right parietal regions) but less in regions that showed a saturation effect with increasing load. These findings suggest that HIV-associated brain injury leads to reduced efficiency in the normal attention network, thus requiring reorganization and increased usage of neural reserves to maintain performance during attention-requiring tasks. Exceeding the brain reserve capacity may lead to attention deficits and cognitive impairment in HIV patients."
"Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the causative organism of Lyme borreliosis, is a heterogeneous group of spirochetes, consisting of at least three pathogenic species. To test the hypothesis that the genetic heterogeneity is the reason for the clinical differences, we investigated whether the experimental disease induced by European isolates is different from that induced by American isolates. Two American isolates of species B. burgdorferi sensu stricto were compared with three European isolates, two of species B. garinii, and one of species B. afzelii. The patterns of infection, immunity, and inflammation induced by the different species was distinctive. Inflammatory cells and levels of antibody in B. garinii- and B. afzelii-infected animals were lower than in B. burgdorferi s.s.-infected animals, whereas levels of spirochetal infection in the skin and nervous system were higher in the former group of animals. These data demonstrate that B. burgdorferi s.s. strains are more infective and inflammatory, whereas B. garinii and B. afzelii strains can survive the adaptive immune response to a greater degree and persist at greater numbers in the skin and nervous system. The results explain to a large extent the disparities between LNB in humans in the United States and Europe."
"It is considered that the site of action of the abortive antimigraine compounds acting at serotonin, 5-HT(1B/1D,) receptors (triptans) is the trigeminovascular system. We tested whether there is a non-trigeminal site of action. The 5-HT(1B/1D) agonist, naratriptan, was microinjected into the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), and activity in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) was monitored. Recordings were made from 20 nociceptive neurons in the dorsal horn of the TNC that received convergent input from the dura mater and face. Responses of neurons to dural, facial cutaneous and corneal stimulation were studied before and after injection of naratriptan. Naratriptan decreased the excitability to electrical stimulation of the dura mater as the A-fiber response decreased by 24 +/- 4.1% (p &lt; 0.001) and the C-fiber response decreased by 42 +/- 8.2% (p &lt; 0.001). Spontaneous activity was decreased by 38 +/- 7.5% (p &lt; 0.001). After injection, the mechanical thresholds of the dura mater increased from (n = 14, p &lt; 0.01). Responses to stimulation of the face and cornea were not altered by injection of naratriptan. These results suggest that 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor activation in the vlPAG activates descending pain-modulating pathways that inhibit dural, but not facial and corneal nociceptive input. These findings have implications for the understanding of the action of triptans in migraine and cluster headache, suggesting that brain loci other than the trigeminal nucleus may play a role in the clinical action of triptans."
"In 2001, we followed up all patients from the 1991 Olmsted County Multiple Sclerosis (MS) prevalence cohort. We found that the longer the duration of MS and the lower the disability, the more likely a patient is to remain stable and not progress. This is particularly powerful for patients with benign MS with Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 2 or lower for 10 years or longer who have a greater than 90% chance of remaining stable. This is important because these patients represent 17% of the entire prevalence cohort. These data should assist in the shared therapeutic decision-making process of whether to start immunomodulatory medications."
"The benefits of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV cognitive disorders vary substantially between individuals. This study evaluated whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drug penetration and CSF virological suppression influence the extent of neuropsychological (NP) improvement during ART. Overall performance on a battery of NP tests administered at baseline and follow-up (median 15 weeks) was computed by using the global deficit score (GDS) methods in 31 cognitively impaired, HIV-infected individuals who began new ART regimens. Virological suppression (attaining undetectable viral load by RT-PCR at follow-up) was assessed separately for plasma and CSF. Subjects on regimens containing greater numbers of CSF-penetrating drugs showed significantly greater reduction in CSF viral load. Subjects attaining CSF virological suppression demonstrated greater GDS improvement than those who did not (median GDS change, 0.62 vs 0.23; p = 0.01). A similar trend for plasma did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.053). NP improvement was greater in ART-naive versus treatment-experienced subjects. In a multivariate model (overall p = 0.0008), significant, independent predictors of GDS reduction were CSF HIV RNA suppression, baseline antiretroviral history, and their interaction. Including CSF-penetrating drugs in the ART regimen and monitoring CSF viral load may be indicated for individuals with HIV-associated cognitive impairment."
"Loss of integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) resulting from ischemia/reperfusion is believed to be a precursor to hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and poor outcome. We used a novel magnetic resonance imaging marker to characterize early BBB disruption in human focal brain ischemia and tested for associations with reperfusion, HT, and poor outcome (modified Rankin score &gt;2). BBB disruption was found in 47 of 144 (33%) patients, having a median time from stroke onset to observation of 10.1 hours. Reperfusion was found to be the most powerful independent predictor of early BBB disruption (p = 0.018; odds ratio, 4.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-13.1). HT was observed in 22 patients; 16 (72.7%) of those also had early BBB disruption (p &lt; 0.001; odds ratio, 8.11; 95% confidence interval, 2.85-23.1). In addition to baseline severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score &gt;6), early BBB disruption was found to be an independent predictor of HT. Because the timing of the disruption was early enough to make it relevant to acute thrombolytic therapy, early BBB disruption as defined by this imaging biomarker may be a promising target for adjunctive therapy to reduce the complications associated with thrombolytic therapy, broaden the therapeutic window, and improve clinical outcome."
"Chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc) is a severe, neurodegenerative disorder that shares clinical features with Huntington's disease and McLeod syndrome. It is caused by mutations in VPS13A, which encodes a large protein called chorein. Using antichorein antisera, we found expression of chorein in all human cells analyzed. However, chorein expression was absent or noticeably reduced in ChAc patient cells, but not McLeod syndrome and Huntington's disease cells. This suggests that loss of chorein expression is a diagnostic feature of ChAc."
"One common genetic change in anaplastic meningiomas is amplification of chromosome 17q23 containing the S6 kinase (S6K) gene. We show, for the first time to our knowledge, increased S6K mRNA expression in anaplastic meningiomas compared with benign tumors. To evaluate S6K as a candidate meningioma progression gene, we generated IOMM-Lee human meningioma cell lines overexpressing S6K. Whereas no effect of S6K overexpression on meningioma cell growth, motility, or adhesion was observed in vitro, S6K overexpression resulted in increased tumor size in vivo. Collectively, these results suggest that S6K is functionally important for meningioma progression and may represent a target for future meningioma therapy."
"Several quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) measures are used to investigate multiple sclerosis (MS) in vivo. Precise quantitative investigation of the histopathological correlates of such measures has, to date, been limited. This study investigates the relationship of quantitative measures of myelin content, axonal density, and gliosis with quantitative MR measures in postmortem (PM) MS tissue. MR imaging (MRI) was performed on a 1.5T scanner and T1-relaxation time (T1-RT) and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) maps were acquired in fresh PM brain of 20 MS subjects. Myelin content, axonal counts, and the extent of gliosis all were quantified using morphometric and digital imaging techniques. MRI and pathological data were in most cases coregistered using stereotactic navigation. Using multiple regression analysis, we detected significant correlations between myelin content (Tr(myelin)) and MTR (r = -0.84, p &lt; 0.001) and myelin content and axonal count (-0.80, p &lt; 0.001); MTR correlated with T1-RT (r = -0.79, p &lt; 0.001). No association was detected between the extent of gliosis and either MR measure. MTR was significantly higher in remyelinated than demyelinated lesions (means: 30.0 [standard deviation, 2.9] vs 23.8 [standard deviation, 4.3], p = 0.008). In conclusion, MTR is affected by myelin content in MS white matter."
"The term frontotemporal dementia (FTD) encompasses a range of clinical syndromes that are believed not to map reliably onto the spectrum of recognized pathologies. This study reexamines the relationships between clinical and pathological subtypes of FTD in a large series from two centers (n = 61). Clinical subtypes defined were behavioral variant FTD (n = 26), language variants (semantic dementia, n = 9; and progressive nonfluent aphasia, n = 8), and motor variants (corticobasal degeneration, n = 9; and motor neuron disease, n = 9), although most cases presented with a combination of behavioral and language problems. Unexpectedly, some behavioral cases (n = 5) had marked amnesia at presentation. The pathological subtypes were those with tau-immunopositive inclusions (with Pick bodies, n = 20; or without, n = 11), those with ubiquitin immunopositive inclusions (n = 16), and those lacking distinctive histology (n = 14). Behavioral symptoms and semantic dementia were associated with a range of pathologies. In contrast, other clinical phenotypes had relatively uniform underlying pathologies: motor neuron disease predicted ubiquitinated inclusions, parkinsonism and apraxia predicted corticobasal pathology, and nonfluent aphasia predicted Pick bodies. Therefore, the pathological substrate can be predicted in a significant proportion of FTD patients, which has important implications for studies targeting mechanistic treatments."
"Among 407 New England Medical Center Posterior Circulation registry patients, 59% had strokes without transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), 24% had TIAs then strokes, and 16% had only TIAs. Embolism was the commonest stroke mechanism (40% of patients including 24% cardiac origin, 14% intraarterial, 2% cardiac and arterial sources). In 32% large artery occlusive lesions caused hemodynamic brain ischemia. Infarcts most often included the distal posterior circulation territory (rostral brainstem, superior cerebellum and occipital and temporal lobes); the proximal (medulla and posterior inferior cerebellum) and middle (pons and anterior inferior cerebellum) territories were equally involved. Severe occlusive lesions (&gt;50% stenosis) involved more than one large artery in 148 patients; 134 had one artery site involved unilaterally or bilaterally. The commonest occlusive sites were: extracranial vertebral artery (52 patients, 15 bilateral) intracranial vertebral artery (40 patients, 12 bilateral), basilar artery (46 patients). Intraarterial embolism was the commonest mechanism of brain infarction in patients with vertebral artery occlusive disease. Thirty-day mortality was 3.6%. Embolic mechanism, distal territory location, and basilar artery occlusive disease carried the poorest prognosis. The best outcome was in patients who had multiple arterial occlusive sites; they had position-sensitive TIAs during months to years."
"Mutations in the PINK1 gene (PARK6), a putative serine-threonine kinase, cause autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease. PINK1 functions as a protein kinase and confers protective effects in the mitochondria, where it is primarily located. We assessed in a population of European ancestry whether common genetic variation in this novel gene influences nonmendelian forms of Parkinson's disease. We defined the linkage disequilibrium structure of PINK1 and used this to identify a set of tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms that we estimate will efficiently represent all of the common DNA variation in the entire gene. Genotyping these tags in a set of 576 Parkinson's disease patients and 514 controls did not demonstrate a case-control partition for allele or for haplotype and thus provides evidence against the existence of a common functional variants in PINK1 that has a strong influence on PD risk."
"Mutated intracellular huntingtin is widely expressed in tissues of Huntington's disease (HD) patients. Intraneuronal nuclear protein aggregates of mutant huntingtin are present in HD brains, suggesting a dysfunction of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Because many cells and tissues can cope with the abnormal gene effects while others dysfunction and die, we determined gene-induced effects and considered the hypothesis that the gene causes multiple intracellular problems, but severe pathology is seen only in selected brain regions. In this study, we found inhibition of UPS function in both early (0-1, with no or little neuronal loss) and late (3-4, with more severe neuronal loss) stage HD patients' cerebellum, cortex, substantia nigra and caudate-putamen brain regions. Late HD stage increases in ubiquitin levels were unique to caudate-putamen. HD patients' skin fibroblasts also had UPS inhibition similar to brain despite increases in proteasome beta-subunit expression. Gene delivery and expression of proteasome activator PA28 increased UPS function in normal but not HD fibroblasts. These generalized UPS problems are associated with severe neuronal pathology only when coupled with decreases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, mitochondrial complex II/III activity, and increases of ubiquitin levels particularly as seen in the caudate-putamen of HD patients."
"The genetic basis of human narcolepsy remains poorly understood. Multiplex families with full-blown narcolepsy-cataplexy are rare, whereas families with both narcolepsy-cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness without cataplexy are more common. We performed a genomewide linkage analysis in a large French family with four members affected with narcolepsy-cataplexy and 10 others with isolated recurrent naps or lapses into sleep. Only three regions showed logarithm of odds (LOD) scores greater than 1 in two-point linkage analysis (D6S1960, D11S2359, and D21S228). Genotyping additional markers provided support for linkage to 9 markers on chromosome 21 (maximum two-point LOD score, 3.36 at D21S1245). The multipoint linkage analysis using SimWalk2 provided further evidence for linkage to the same region (maximum parametric LOD score, 4.00 at 21GT26K). A single haplotype was shared by all affected individuals and informative crossovers indicated that the elusive gene that confers susceptibility to narcolepsy is likely to be located between markers D21S267 and ABCG1, in a 5.15 Mb region of 21q."
"Current practical evidence-based acute treatments of cluster headache are limited to subcutaneous and intranasal formulations of sumatriptan, and oxygen. Two small randomized, double-blind trials suggested efficacy of somatostatin in cluster headache. We sought to determine whether octreotide, a somatostatin analog, is effective in the abortive treatment of acute cluster headache. Patients with episodic and chronic cluster headache, as defined by the International Headache Society, were recruited to a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study. Patients were instructed to treat two attacks of at least moderate pain severity, with at least a 24-hour break, using subcutaneous octreotide microg or matching placebo. The primary end point was the headache response defined as very severe, severe, or moderate pain becomes mild or nil, at 30 minutes. The primary end point was examined using a multilevel analysis approach. A total of 57 patients were recruited of whom 46 provided efficacy data on attacks treated with octreotide and 45 with placebo. The headache response rate with subcutaneous octreotide was 52%, whereas that with placebo was 36%. Modeling the treatment outcome as a binomial where response was determined by treatment, using the patient as the level 2 variable, and considering period effect, sex, and cluster headache type as other variables of interest, we found that the effect of subcutaneous octreotide 100 microg was significantly superior to placebo (p &lt; 0.01). Subcutaneous octreotide 100 microg is effective in the acute treatment of cluster headache when compared with placebo. Nonvasconstrictor treatment of acute cluster headache is possible."
"Balloon cells (BCs) in focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and giant cells (GCs) in tubers of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) share phenotypic similarities. TSC1 or TSC2 gene mutations in TSC lead to mTOR pathway activation and p70S6kinase (phospho-S6K) and ribosomal S6 (phospho-S6) protein phosphorylation. Phospho-S6K, phospho-S6, and phospho-S6K-activated proteins phospho-STAT3 and phospho-4EBP1 were detected immunohistochemically in GCs, whereas only phospho-S6 was observed in BCs. Expression of four candidate gene families (cell signaling, cell adhesion, growth factor/receptor, and transcription factor mRNAs) was assayed in single, microdissected phospho-S6-immunolabeled BCs and GCs as a strategy to define whether BCs and GCs exhibit differential transcriptional profiles. Among 60 genes, differential expression of 24 mRNAs distinguished BCs from GCs and only 4 genes showed similar expression profiles between BCs and GCs. Tuberin mRNA levels were reduced in GCs from TSC patients with TSC2 gene mutations but were unchanged in BCs. Phospho-S6K, -S6, -STAT3, and -4EBP1 expression in GCs reflects loss of hamartin-tuberin-mediated mTOR pathway inhibition. Phospho-S6 expression alone in BCs does not support mTOR cascade activation in FCD. Differential gene expression profiles in BCs and GCs supports the hypothesis that these cell types derive by distinct pathogenic mechanisms."
Study of patients with callosal lesions can provide insight into the mediation of spatial attention-intention by each hemisphere. Two patients with anterior callosal strokes bisected lines to the left of midline with the left hand and to the right of midline with the right in both a visual and tactile bisection task. The patients demonstrated a similar pattern of performance on pointing to body-midline in space. These results are consistent with the notion that each hemisphere supports spatial attention-intention toward contralateral space and that the corpus callosum is critical in the integration of such information.
"This investigation assessed the frequency of catamenial epilepsy in 87 women who charted seizures and menses during three cycles. Catamenial epilepsy designation was made if two of three cycles showed at least one of three previously defined catamenial patterns. Among ovulatory cycles, average daily seizure frequency was significantly greater during the perimenstrual and preovulatory phases. Among anovulatory cycles, average daily seizure frequency was substantially less during the midfollicular phase than during the remainder of the cycle. Overall, 39.1% of the women had catamenial epilepsy."
"We assessed maximal saccade velocity (MSV) in 82 spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) patients and 80 controls, correlating it to disease duration, polyglutamine expansion size, age at onset, ataxia score, age, and sex. Little overlap with normal values was found even at earliest stages. Stepwise linear regression analysis showed that 60-degree MSV was strongly influenced by polyglutamine size and less by disease duration, whereas the reverse was found for ataxia score. Saccade velocity thus is a sensitive, quite specific, and objective endophenotype, useful to search polyglutamine modifier genes."
"Acquired neuromyotonia (ANM) is associated with antibodies to voltage-gated K+ channels (VGKCs). ANM sera reduce the number of K+ currents in neuronal cell lines, but it is not clear how the antibodies act. Here, we show by using the NB-1 cell line that the reduction in K+ currents by IgG is independent of added complement. IgG Fc and Fab fragments from ANM sera had no effect, but three of four ANM F(ab')2 fragments significantly reduced K+ currents. Thus, cross-linking of the channels by divalent antibodies is likely to be an important mechanism in reducing K+ currents."
"Antibodies specific for a complex of gangliosides GD1a and GD1b (GD1a/GD1b) were found in sera from eight of 100 patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) by the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and thin-layer chromatogram immunostaining. Those sera also had antibody activities to such ganglioside complexes as GD1a/GM1, GD1b/GT1b, and GM1/GT1b but had little or no reactivity to the each isolated antigen. Clustered epitopes of the ganglioside complex in the plasma membrane may be targeted by such an antibody, and interaction between the antibody and ganglioside complex may induce the neuropathy."
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease associated with the death of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem. The cause of ALS is unknown and there is no cure. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) delays progression of symptoms and prolongs survival in a Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) transgenic mouse model of ALS. These observations suggest that VEGF or related compounds, might be of value in the treatment of ALS patients."
"IFN-beta is effective in reducing relapses and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS). It is assumed that individual therapeutic responses vary, but methods to identify IFN-beta responsiveness have not been validated. Our objective was to evaluate methods to classify IFN-beta responder status using relapses and MRI lesions. Data was analyzed from 172 patients who were followed up in a placebo-controlled clinical trial of IFN-beta1a for 2 years. Patients were classified as responders or nonresponders using (1) the number of relapses during the 2-year trial; (2) the number of new T2 lesions after 2 years; and (3) the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions at year 1 and year 2 on study. Outcomes included 2-year change in the Expanded Disability Status Scale, Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite, and brain parenchymal fraction. We found that subgroups with high on-study relapse numbers had more disease progression, differences between responder subgroups were similar in the IFN-beta1a and placebo arms. In contrast, subgroups with high numbers of new MRI lesions had significantly more disease progression only in the IFN-beta1a arm. Baseline characteristics failed to account for differential outcome. New MRI lesion activity during IFN-beta1a treatment correlates with poor response to IFN-beta1a. MRI classification may facilitate rational therapeutic decisions, better clinical trial designs, and studies correlating biomarkers with therapeutic response."
"DYT1 dystonia is a severe form of young-onset dystonia caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes for the protein torsinA, which is thought to play a role in protein transport and degradation. We describe, for the first time to our knowledge, perinuclear inclusion bodies in the midbrain reticular formation and periaqueductal gray in four clinically documented and genetically confirmed DYT1 patients but not in controls. The inclusions were located within cholinergic and other neurons in the pedunculopontine nucleus, cuneiform nucleus, and griseum centrale mesencephali and stained positively for ubiquitin, torsinA, and the nuclear envelope protein lamin A/C. No evidence of inclusion body formation was detected in the substantia nigra pars compacta, striatum, hippocampus, or selected regions of the cerebral cortex. We also noted tau/ubiquitin-immunoreactive aggregates in pigmented neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and locus coeruleus in all four DYT1 dystonia cases, but not in controls. This study supports the notion that DYT1 dystonia is associated with impaired protein handling and the nuclear envelope. The role of the pedunculopontine and cuneiform nuclei, and related brainstem brainstem structures, in mediating motor activity and controlling muscle tone suggests that alterations in these structures could underlie the pathophysiology of DYT1 dystonia [corrected]"
"Substantia nigra (SN) neurons were counted on single, transverse caudal midbrain sections from 217 male participants in the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study, aged 74-97 years at death. Quadrants areas within the SN were determined with a planimeter and neuronal density was expressed as neurons/mm(2) for 10 Parkinson's disease (PD) cases, 29 incidental Lewy body cases, and 178 controls with neither condition. Mean densities in all quadrants were significantly lower in the PD group compared with the other groups (p = 0.006). This relationship was strongest in the ventrolateral quadrant. In a subgroup of 50 controls who were examined with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale an average of 2.1 years prior to death, there was an association of stooped posture (p = 0.009), postural instability (p = 0.013), body bradykinesia (p = 0.048), and gait disturbance (p = 0.05) with neuron density in the dorsolateral quadrant; and impaired speech (p = 0.014), abnormal facial expression (p = 0.022), and difficulty rising from a chair (p = 0.032) with neuron density in the dorsomedial quadrant. There was a significant association of increasing number of signs present with decreasing neuron density in both quadrants (p = 0.001 for trend). Low SN neuron density may be the basis for parkinsonian signs in the elderly without PD."
"PAX6 mutations are associated with absence/hypoplasia of the anterior commissure and reduction in the callosal area in humans. Both of these structures contain auditory interhemispheric fibers. The aim of this study was to characterize central auditory function in patients with a PAX6 mutation. We conducted central auditory tests (dichotic speech, pattern, and gaps in noise tests) on eight subjects with a PAX6 mutation and eight age- and sex-matched controls. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed absent/hypoplastic anterior commissure in six and a hypoplastic corpus callosum in three PAX6 subjects. The control group gave normal central auditory tests results. All the PAX6 subjects gave abnormal results in at least two tests that require interhemispheric transfer, and all but one gave normal results in a test not requiring interhemispheric transfer. The left ear scores in the dichotic speech tests was significantly lower in the PAX6 than in the control group. These results are consistent with deficient auditory interhemispheric transfer in patients with a PAX6 mutation, which may be attributable to structural and/or functional abnormalities of the anterior commisure and corpus callosum, although the exact contribution of these two formations to our findings remains unclear. Our unique findings broaden the possible functions of PAX6 to include neurodevelopmental roles in higher order auditory processing."
"Data on the familial aggregation of Parkinson's disease (PD) remain conflicting. We conducted a historical cohort study of 1,001 first-degree relatives of 162 probands with PD and of 851 relatives of 147 control probands representative of the population of Olmsted County, Minnesota (from 1976 through 1995). In addition, we studied 2,713 first-degree relatives of 411 probands with PD referred to the Mayo Clinic from 1996 through 2000 and 625 spouses of PD or control probands. Whenever possible, relatives were interviewed and screened for parkinsonism either directly or through a proxy, and those who screened positive were examined or a copy of their medical record was obtained to confirm the diagnosis (family study method). Thirty relatives of population-based PD probands, 18 relatives of population-based control probands, 65 relatives of referral PD probands, and 8 spouses had developed PD. Combining population-based with referral PD probands and population-based control probands with spouses, the relative risk was modestly increased (relative risk, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-2.64). Relatives of probands with younger onset (&lt;/=66 years; first tertile) had a more significantly increased risk (relative risk, 2.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.66-4.15), whereas relatives of probands with later onset had no increased risk. The relative risk decreased when the incidence of all types of parkinsonism was considered."
"We report a cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-deficient patient, clinically affected with Leigh-like disease, with a homozygous mutation in the COX10 start codon. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed a decrease of fully assembled COX without the accumulation of partially assembled COX subcomplexes. Western blot analysis with antibodies directed to COX subunits I, II, and IV showed a decrease of these subunits in this patient compared with control. Overexpression of the COX10 protein in the patient's fibroblasts proved that the detected mutation was indeed the disease cause."
"Extremely long (&gt;150) CAG repeats are often used to create models of polyglutamine diseases yet are very rare in humans where they manifest as pediatric multisystem syndromes of little specificity. Here, we describe an infant with 180 CAG repeats in the spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 gene and focus on systemic ataxin-7 aggregation. This was found in many organs, including the cardiovascular system. In the brain, the hippocampus emerged as a principal site of ataxin-7 aggregation without cell loss. We note differential ubiquitination of aggregates and discuss how this may relate to selective vulnerability."
"Superior canal dehiscence syndrome is a newly recognized syndrome characterized by vertigo and nystagmus induced by sound (Tullio phenomenon) or changes of middle ear (Hennebert sign) or intracranial pressure. We report on a patient with bilateral superior canal dehiscence syndrome who presented with unusual manifestations including pulse-synchronous vertical pendular nystagmus and Valsalva-induced, up and counterclockwise-beating jerk nystagmus. These unusual symptoms may be a clue to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of superior canal dehiscence syndrome. Abnormal communication between the inner ears and the intracranial space may explain the vertical pendular and pulse-synchronous nystagmus, modulated by increased intracranial pressure."
"In diabetic nerves, the activation of the polyol pathway and a resulting decrease in Na(+)-K(+) ATPase activity lead to intra-axonal Na(+) accumulation and a smaller Na(+) gradient across the axolemma than normal. To investigate whether glycemic control is associated with acutely reversible changes in axonal excitability and Na(+) conductance, we measured the multiple excitability indices (strength-duration time constant, rheobase, refractoriness, and refractory period) of the median motor axons of 21 diabetic patients before and after intensive insulin treatment. Within 4 weeks after treatment was begun, there was a significant improvement in nerve conduction velocities, associated with increased strength-duration time constant, decreased rheobase, increased refractoriness, and prolonged refractory periods. Assuming that the strength-duration time constant partly reflects persistent Na(+) conductance, and that refractoriness/refractory periods depend on inactivation of transient Na(+) channels caused by prior depolarization (the influx of Na(+)), the patterns of changes in these indices may reflect a reduced trans-axonal Na(+) gradient during hyperglycemia and its restoration by glycemic control in diabetic patients. Measurement of the excitability indices could provide new insights into the pathophysiology of human diabetic neuropathy."
"Degeneration of cholinergic nucleus basalis (NB) cortical projection neurons is associated with cognitive decline in late-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). NB neuron survival is dependent on coexpression of the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors p75(NTR) and TrkA, which bind NGF in cortical projection sites. We have shown previously a significant reduction of NB perikarya expressing p75(NTR) and TrkA protein during the early stages of AD. Whether there is a concomitant reduction in cortical levels of these receptors during the progression of AD is unknown. p75(NTR) and TrkA protein was evaluated by quantitative immunoblotting in five cortical regions (anterior cingulate, superior frontal, superior temporal, inferior parietal, and visual cortex) of individuals clinically diagnosed with no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mild/moderate AD, or severe AD. Cortical p75(NTR) levels were stable across the diagnostic groups. In contrast, TrkA levels were reduced approximately 50% in mild/moderate and severe AD compared with NCI and MCI in all regions except visual cortex. Mini-Mental Status Examination scores correlated with TrkA levels in anterior cingulate, superior frontal, and superior temporal cortex. The selective reduction of cortical TrkA levels relative to p75(NTR) may have important consequences for cholinergic NB function during the transition from MCI to AD."
"To evaluate the possible roles of the Akt/PKB-mTOR-p70S6K-S6 and cap-dependent translation (eIF4G) pathways in the pathogenesis of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated cortical tubers and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), we performed qualitative and semiquantitative immunohistochemical evaluation on surgically resected corticectomy specimens to detect phosphorylated molecules as activated downstream targets of the signaling pathways. A tissue microarray paraffin block was constructed from 63 archival specimens of surgically resected TSC tubers, FCDs with balloon cells, cortical dysplasia without balloon cells, and histologically normal-appearing neocortex obtained from cases with Rasmussen encephalitis, cystic-gliotic encephalopathy, and temporal lobe epilepsy. Abnormal neuroglial cells were positive for phospho-S6 and phospho-eIF4G with various staining intensities in FCDs and TSC tubers. Both proteins were much less abundantly expressed in normal-appearing neocortex. Phospho-mTOR expression was observed in neurons in all groups. The expression of phospho-S6 and phospho-eIF4G was associated with dysplastic lesions (p &lt; 0.05), and the cytoplasmic phospho-p70S6K expression was most specific for and abundant in TSC tubers and much less prominent in other groups (p &lt; 0.01). These results suggest that constitutive activation of cytoplasmic p70S6K plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of TSC tubers and that FCDs possess a distinct mechanism for activation of S6 and eIF4G."
"A novel mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transition (3733G--&gt;A) inducing the E143 K amino acid change at a very conserved site of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1) was identified in a family with six maternally related individuals with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) and in an unrelated sporadic case, all negative for known mutations and presenting with the canonical phenotype. The transition was not detected in 1,082 control mtDNAs and was heteroplasmic in several individuals from both pedigrees. In addition, the mtDNAs of the two families were found to belong to different haplogroups (H and X), thus confirming that the 3733G--&gt;A mutation occurred twice independently. Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy disclosed an in vivo brain and skeletal muscle energy metabolism deficit in the four examined patients. Muscle biopsy from two patients showed slight mitochondrial proliferation with abnormal mitochondria. Biochemical investigations in platelets showed partially insensitive complex I to rotenone inhibition. We conclude that the 3733G--&gt;A transition is a novel cause of LHON and, after those at positions 3460 and 4171, is the third ND1 mutation to be identified in multiple unrelated families. This finding shows that, in addition to ND6, the ND1 subunit gene is also a mutational hot spot for LHON."
"Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) type II is an autosomal recessive disorder clinically characterized by distal and proximal sensory loss that is caused by the reduction or absence of peripheral sensory nerves. Recently, a novel gene called HSN2 has been found to be the cause of HSAN type II in five families from Newfoundland and Quebec. Screening of this gene in an HSAN type II Lebanese family showed a 1bp deletion mutation found in a homozygous state in all affected individuals. This novel mutation supports the hypothesis that HSN2 is the causative gene for HSAN type II."
"Serum of a patient with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) and malignant melanoma had a unique reactivity with Purkinje cells that was not observed in serum of patients with PCD and other tumors, or with malignant melanoma without paraneoplastic syndromes. The screening of a human cerebellar complementary DNA expression library with the patient's serum resulted in the isolation of the CA8 gene. CA8 encodes carbonic anhydrase-related protein (CARP) VIII, preferentially expressed in Purkinje cells. The patient had intrathecal synthesis of CARP VIII antibodies. One of seven melanomas tested expressed CARP VIII. These data suggest CARP VIII may be an autoantigen involved in the pathogenesis of melanoma-associated PCD."
"The hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders characterized by progressive lower-limb spasticity. In this study, we performed linkage analysis on an autosomal recessive pure HSP family and mapped the disease to chromosome 10q22.1-10q24.1, a locus partially overlapping the existing SPG9 locus. We have either identified a novel locus for pure recessive HSP (SPG27), or we have found the first case of allelic disorders with different mode of inheritance in HSP. If the disorders are indeed allelic, our results have reduced the SPG9 interval by 3Mb with D10S536 and D10S1758 as flanking markers."
"Impairment of mitochondrial energy metabolism has been associated with a wide range of human disorders. Large-scale partial deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cause sporadic Kearns-Sayre syndrome, a fatal multisystem disorder, in which the majority of mtDNAs in affected tissues have deletions (Delta-mtDNAs). Since most mtDNA-related diseases, including Kearns-Sayre syndrome, are recessive, only a few wild-type mtDNAs can compensate for the deleterious effects of many Delta-mtDNAs. We have developed a pharmacological approach to reduce the proportion of Delta-mtDNAs in vitro, in which we grow cells in medium containing ketone bodies, replacing glucose as the carbon source. Cells containing 100% Delta-mtDNA died after 5 days of treatment, whereas those containing 100% wild-type mtDNA survived. Furthermore, in a cloned heteroplasmic cell line, the proportion of wild-type mtDNA increased from 13% initially to approximately 22% after 5 days in ketogenic medium and was accompanied by a dramatic improvement in mitochondrial protein synthesis. We also present evidence that treatment with ketone bodies caused ""heteroplasmic shifting"" not only among cells (ie, intercellular selection) but also within cells (ie, intracellular selection). The demonstration that ketone bodies can distinguish between normal and respiratorily compromised cells points to the potential use of a ketogenic diet to treat patients with heteroplasmic mtDNA disorders."
"Myotonic syndromes and periodic paralyses are rare disorders of skeletal muscle characterized mainly by muscle stiffness or episodic attacks of weakness. Familial forms are caused by mutations in genes coding for skeletal muscle voltage-gated ion channels. Exercise is known to trigger, aggravate, or relieve the symptoms. Therefore, exercise can be used as a functional test in electromyography to improve the diagnosis of these muscle disorders. Abnormal changes in the compound muscle action potential can be disclosed using different exercise tests. We report the outcome of an inclusive electromyographic survey of a large population of patients with identified ion channel gene defects. Standardized protocols comprising short and long exercise tests were applied on 41 unaffected control subjects and on 51 case patients with chloride, sodium, or calcium channel mutations known to cause myotonia or periodic paralysis. These tests disclosed significant changes of compound muscle action potential, which generally matched the clinical symptoms. Combining the responses to the different tests defined five electromyographic patterns (I-V) that correlated with subgroups of mutations and may be used in clinical practice as guides for molecular diagnosis. We hypothesize that mutations are segregated into the different electromyographic patterns according to the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms."
"The GM2 gangliosidoses are caused by incomplete catabolism of GM2 ganglioside in the lysosome, leading to progressive storage and a neurodegenerative clinical course. An inflammatory response (microglial activation, macrophage infiltration, oxidative damage) has been found to be a consequence of GM2 storage in the brain, although it remains unclear whether this contributes to pathogenesis or disease progression. In this study, we treated Sandhoff disease mice with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (indomethacin, aspirin, and ibuprofen) and antioxidants (L-ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol acetate). The treated mice lived significantly longer than untreated littermates (12-23%, p &lt;0.0001) and showed a slower rate of disease progression (p &lt;0.001). When aspirin treatment was combined with substrate reduction therapy, synergy resulted (11%, p &lt;0.05) with a maximum improvement of 73% in survival (p &lt;0.00001). This study demonstrates that inflammation contributes to disease progression and identifies antiinflammatory and antioxidant therapies as a potential adjunctive approach to slow the clinical course of this and related disorders."
"Five right-handed patients with a right-sided vestibular neuritis were examined twice with fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography while lying supine with eyes closed: once during the acute stage (mean, 6.6 days) and then 3 months later when central vestibular compensation had occurred. Regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCGM) was significantly increased (p &lt;0.001 uncorrected) during the acute stage in multisensory vestibular cortical and subcortical areas (parietoinsular vestibular cortex in the posterior insula, posterolateral thalamus, anterior cingulate gyrus [Brodmann area 32/24], pontomesencephalic brainstem, hippocampus). Simultaneously, there was a significant rCGM decrease in the visual (Brodmann area 17 to 19) and somatosensory cortex areas in the postcentral gyrus as well as in parts of the auditory cortex (transverse temporal gyrus). Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography thus allows imaging of the cortical activation pattern that is induced by unilateral peripheral vestibular loss. It was possible to demonstrate that the central vestibular system including the vestibular cortex exhibits a visual-vestibular activation-deactivation pattern during the acute stage of vestibular neuritis similar to that in healthy volunteers during unilateral labyrinthine stimulation. Contrary to experimental vestibular stimulation, the activation of the vestibular cortex was not bilateral but was unilateral and contralateral to the right-sided labyrinthine failure."
"The term Charcot-Wilbrand syndrome (CWS) denotes dream loss following focal brain damage. We report the first case of CWS, in whom neuropsychological functions, extension of the underlying lesion, and sleep architecture changes were assessed. A 73-year-old woman reported a total dream loss after acute, bilateral occipital artery infarction (including the right inferior lingual gyrus), which lasted for over 3 months. In the absence of sleep-wake complaints and (other) neuropsychological deficits, polysomnography demonstrated an essentially normal sleep architecture with preservation of REM sleep. Dreaming was denied also after repeated awakenings from REM sleep. This observation suggests that CWS (1) can represent a distinct and isolated neuropsychological manifestation of deep occipital lobe damage, and (2) may occur in the absence of detectable REM sleep abnormalities."
"Two homozygous mutations in the PINK1 gene, encoding a mitochondrial putative protein kinase, recently have been identified in families with PARK6-linked, autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism (AREP). Here, we describe a novel homozygous mutation (1573_1574 insTTAG) identified in an AREP patient, which causes a frameshift and truncation at the C-terminus of the PINK1 protein, outside the kinase catalytic domain. The clinical phenotype includes early-onset (28 years) parkinsonism, foot dystonia at onset, good levodopa response, slow progression, early levodopa-induced dyskinesias, and sleep benefit, thereby resembling closely parkin-related disease. These findings confirm that recessive mutations in PINK1 cause early-onset parkinsonism and expand the associated clinical phenotype."
"Individuals with Down's syndrome develop Alzheimer's-like pathologies comparatively early in life, including progressive degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs). Cholinergic hypofunction contributes to dementia-related cognitive decline and remains a target of therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer's disease. In light of this, partial trisomy 16 (Ts65Dn) mice have been developed to provide an animal model of Down's syndrome that exhibits progressive loss of BFCNs and cognitive ability. Another feature common to both Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease is neuroinflammation, which may exacerbate neurodegeneration, including cholinergic loss. Minocycline is a semisynthetic tetracycline with antiinflammatory properties that has demonstrated neuroprotective properties in certain disease models. Consistent with a role for inflammatory processes in BFCN degeneration, we have shown previously that minocycline protects BFCNs and improves memory in mice with acute, immunotoxic BFCN lesions. We now report that minocycline treatment inhibits microglial activation, prevents progressive BFCN decline, and markedly improves performance of Ts65Dn mice on a working and reference memory task. Minocycline is an established antiinflammatory and neuroprotective drug and may provide a novel approach to treat specific AD-like pathologies."
"PINK1 was recently found to be associated with PARK6 as the causative gene. We performed mutation analysis in eight inbred families whose haplotypes link to the PARK6 region. We identified six pathogenic mutations (R246X, H271Q, E417G, L347P, and Q239X/R492X) in six unrelated families. All sites of mutations were novel, suggesting that PINK1 may be the second most common causative gene next to parkin in parkinsonism with the recessive mode of inheritance."
"We have recently reported homozygous mutations in the PINK1 gene in three consanguineous families with early-onset parkinsonism (EOP) linked to the PARK6 locus. To further evaluate the pathogenic role of PINK1 in EOP and to draw genotype-phenotype correlates, we performed PINK1 mutation analysis in a cohort of Italian EOP patients, mostly sporadic, with onset younger than 50 years of age. Seven of 100 patients carried missense mutations in PINK1. Two patients had two PINK1 mutations, whereas in five patients only one mutation was identified. Age at onset was in the fourth-fifth decade (range, 37-47 years). The clinical picture was characterized by a typical parkinsonian phenotype with asymmetric onset and rare occurrence of atypical features. Slow progression and excellent response to levodopa were observed in all subject. Two of 200 healthy control individuals also carried one heterozygous missense mutation. The identification of a higher number of patients (5%) than controls (1%) carrying a single heterozygous mutation, along with previous positron emission tomography studies demonstrating a preclinical nigrostriatal dysfunction in PARK6 carriers, supports the hypothesis that haploinsufficiency of PINK1, as well as of other EOP genes, may represent a susceptibility factor toward parkinsonism. However, the pathogenetic significance of heterozygous PINK1 mutations still remains to be clarified."
"Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury is a major cause of permanent neurological dysfunction in children. An approach to study the treatment of neonatal HI encephalopathy that allows for neuroprotection is to investigate the states of tolerance to HI. Twenty-four-hour carotid-artery ligation preconditioning established by delaying the onset of hypoxia for 24 hours after permanent unilateral carotid ligation rats markedly diminished the cerebral injury, however, the signaling mechanisms of this carotid-artery ligation preconditioning in neonatal rats remain unknown. Ligation of the carotid artery 24 hours before hypoxia provided complete neuroprotection and produced improved performance on the Morris water maze compared with ligation performed 1 hour before hypoxia. Carotid artery ligation 6 hours before hypoxia produced intermediate benefit. The 24-hour carotid-artery ligation preconditioning was associated with a robust and sustained activation of a transcription factor, the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), on its phosphorylation site on Ser133. Intracerebroventricular infusions of antisense CREB oligodeoxynucleotides significantly reduced the 24-hour carotid-artery ligation-induced neuroprotection effects by decreasing CREB expressions. Pharmacological activation of the cAMP-CREB signaling with rolipram 24 hours before hypoxia protected rat pups at behavioral and pathological levels by sustained increased CREB phosphorylation. This study suggests that 24-hour carotid-artery ligation preconditioning provides important mechanisms for potential pharmacological preconditioning against neonatal HI brain injury."
"We report three heterozygous missense mutations of the skeletal muscle alpha actin gene (ACTA1) in three unrelated cases of congenital fiber type disproportion (CFTD) from Japan and Australia. This represents the first genetic cause of CFTD to be identified and confirms that CFTD is genetically heterogeneous. The three mutations we have identified Leucine221Proline, Aspartate292Valine, and Proline332Serine are novel. They have not been found previously in any cases of nemaline, actin, intranuclear rod, or rod-core myopathy caused by mutations in ACTA1. It remains unclear why these mutations cause type 1 fiber hypotrophy but no nemaline bodies. The three mutations all lie on one face of the actin monomer on the surface swept by tropomyosin during muscle activity, which may suggest a common pathological mechanism. All three CFTD cases with ACTA1 mutations had severe congenital weakness and respiratory failure without ophthalmoplegia. There were no clinical features specific to CFTD cases with ACTA1 mutations, but the presence of normal eye movements in a severe CFTD patient may be an important clue for the presence of a mutation in ACTA1."
"In 1996, our group published objective electroencephalogram (EEG) criteria to define periodic sharp-wave complexes (PSWCs) suggestive for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). These criteria have since then been strictly applied in all cases reported to us as possible CJD in the course of the German CJD surveillance study. Furthermore, EEG analysis of the records was performed without any additional information on complementary clinical and laboratory data. In this study, we investigated sensitivity, specificity, and the predictive values of these EEG criteria exclusively in cases in which autopsy confirmed (n=150) or excluded (n=56) CJD. EEG criteria were positive in 64% (n=96) of the CJD cases and falsely positive in 9% (n=5) of other dementias. The resulting figures for sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 64%, 91%, 95%, and 49%, respectively. In the falsely positive cases, Alzheimer's disease (n=4) and vascular dementia (n=1) were the underlying diseases. However, only in one of these five cases both clinical and EEG data would have led to the false-positive result to diagnose probable CJD. These data prove the high diagnostic value of our objective EEG criteria in CJD."
"A contributing factor to the failure of trials of neuroprotectants in acute ischemic stroke may be the differing vulnerability to ischemia of white compared with gray matter. To address this issue, we determined to establish the existence of potentially viable tissue in white matter and its evolution to infarction or salvage in both gray and white matter compartments in patients with ischemic stroke. Twenty-seven patients (mean age, 73.4 years) at a median of 16.5 hours after symptom onset were studied using the hypoxic marker 18F-misonidazole with positron emission tomography (PET). Tissue was segmented using an magnetic resonance probabilistic map. Although there was a greater volume of initially ""at-risk tissue"" in gray matter (58.3 cm3, 29.9-93.0 cm3 than white matter (42.0 cm3, 15.8-74.0 cm3; p &lt;0.001) at the time of PET imaging, a higher proportion of this was still potentially viable in white matter (41.4%, 4.6-74.5%) than in gray matter (23.6%, 3.2-61.1%; p &lt;0.05). However, a similar proportion in each compartment spontaneously survived. These data provide evidence for the existence of potentially salvageable tissue in human white matter and is consistent with it having a similar or even greater resistance to ischemia than gray matter. For the latter possibility, alternative therapeutic strategies may be required for its salvage."
"Whereas most febrile seizures (FSs) carry a benign outcome, a subpopulation of individuals with prolonged FSs are at risk for later temporal lobe epilepsy. Signal changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may provide early markers for changes in neuronal integrity that may promote epileptogenesis in such individuals. Here, we used serial MRIs, obtained before and at several time points after experimental prolonged FSs, to determine the prevalence and distribution of signal changes on T2-weighted images and to investigate the pathological substrates leading to these changes. Seventy-five percent of immature rats with experimental prolonged FSs had abnormal T2 signal enhancement at 24 hours, and 87.5% at 8 days after the seizures. The altered T2 values involved the dorsal hippocampus (75%), the piriform cortex (87.5%), and the amygdala (25%). However, these changes were not accompanied by evidence of neuronal injury or death in these regions, as assessed using the Fluoro-Jade method. Thus, experimental prolonged FSs lead to relatively frequent abnormal MRI signal in ""temporal lobe"" structures. Although these changes do not signify cell death, they may denote pathological cellular processes that promote epileptogenesis. ."
"We identified a large Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease family with a novel mutation in the Connexin 32 (Cx32) P2 promoter region at position -526bp. This mutation was in a highly conserved SOX10 binding site. Functional studies were conducted on the Cx32 promoter that showed that this mutation reduced the activity of the Cx32 promoter and the affinity for SOX10 binding. These data suggest that interaction between the Cx32 P2 promoter, SOX10, and EGR2 highlight a mechanism of peripheral nerve dysfunction."
"Familial Parkinson's disease (PD) has been linked to missense and genomic multiplication mutations of the alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA). Genetic variability within SNCA has been implicated in idiopathic PD in many populations. We now confirm and extend these findings, within a Belgian sample, using a high-resolution map of genetic markers across the SNCA locus. Our study implicates the SNCA promoter in susceptibility to PD, and more specifically defines a minimum promoter haplotype, spanning approximately 15.3kb of sequence, which is overrepresented in patients. Our findings represent a biomarker for PD and may have implications for patient diagnosis, longitudinal evaluation, and treatment."
"We investigated coexisting autoantibodies in sera of 553 patients with a neurological presentation and one or more paraneoplastic neuronal nuclear or cytoplasmic autoantibodies: antineuronal nuclear autoantibody type 1 (ANNA-1), ANNA-2, ANNA-3; Purkinje cell cytoplasmic autoantibody type 1 (PCA-1), PCA-2; and CRMP-5-immunoglobulin G or amphiphysin-immunoglobulin G. Except for PCA-1, which occurred alone, 31% of sera had more than one of these autoantibodies. In addition, 25% of sera had neuronal calcium channel (P/Q-type or N-type), potassium channel, ganglionic acetylcholine receptor, muscle acetylcholine receptor, or striational antibodies. The autoantibody profiles observed in patients with paraneoplastic disorders imply the targeting of multiple onconeural antigens and predict the patient's neoplasm, but not a specific neurological syndrome."
"Disturbances in surround inhibition could account for various movement disorders. Here we test the functional operation of surround inhibition in focal hand dystonia. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was set to be triggered by self-initiated voluntary flexion of the index finger. During this movement, motor-evoked potential amplitudes from the little finger muscle were significantly suppressed in healthy subjects but enhanced in dystonia patients. This result supports the idea that disturbed surround inhibition is a principal pathophysiological mechanism of dystonia."
"Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in the setting of parkinsonism or dementia often reflects an underlying synucleinopathy. Lewy bodies, intraneuronal aggregates containing abnormal alpha-synuclein, are absent in most cases of parkinsonism with parkin mutations (Park2). We performed clinical history and video-polysomnography in 10 Park2 patients (seven men; age, 51.2 +/- 11.6 years; parkinsonism duration, 18.3 +/- 11.2 years) and found RBD in 6. In all instances, RBD followed the onset of motor symptoms by several years. Our study shows that RBD is frequent in Park2, suggesting that mechanisms other than synuclein deposition can cause RBD in neurodegenerative disorders."
"We have known for a long time that erythropoietin signaling plays a key role in bone marrow erythrocyte proliferation. However, recent studies have indicated that erythropoietin also may have protective effects on the nervous system. This unexpected role remains incompletely characterized. To investigate the potential neuroprotective role of erythropoietin in the central nervous system, we assessed its effects on a well-characterized autoimmune demyelinating model of multiple sclerosis-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the mouse. We found that erythropoietin administered intravenously for 14 days after the onset of symptoms reduced both disease severity and duration of maximum impairment at dose levels as low as 50U/kg (p &lt; 0.001). We assessed the neuropathology of diseased spinal cords and found that erythropoietin-treated EAE animals had reduced axonal damage, inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelination, and diminished blood-brain barrier leakage when compared with saline-treated EAE controls. Moreover, the pronounced upregulation of spinal cord major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression found in saline-treated EAE was significantly reduced in erythropoietin-treated animals, a finding we replicated in vitro, using microglial cultures. The notion that short-term erythropoietin therapy might be of clinical benefit in human autoimmune demyelinating diseases needs investigation."
"Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) play an important role as the autoantigens in certain autoimmune disorders including neurological diseases such as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis and paraneoplastic neurological syndromes. To clarify their implication in multiple sclerosis (MS), we assayed antibodies (Abs) against hnRNP A and B proteins in sera and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients and compared the results with 25 patients with other neurological diseases (ONDs). Using recombinant hnRNP A1, A2, and B1 proteins and Western blotting for the assay, we found Abs against hnRNP B1 in CSF from 32 of 35 MS patients (91.4%) but not in any sera or CSF of the 25 OND patients. Most notably, no Abs against hnRNP B1 were found in sera of all 22 MS patients examined. Although Abs against hnRNP A1 and A2 were concomitantly found in CSF reacting with B1, their incidence and immunoreactivity were lower or weaker than those of anti-hnRNP B1 Abs. There was no correlation between the reactivity of CSF with hnRNP B1 and CSF parameters-such as the number of the cells and the IgG level-or clinical parameters-such as duration of illness and disease activity. The selective generation of Abs against hnRNP B1 in CSF was shown to be highly specific for MS, which makes them a disease marker."
"We assessed decision-making capacity and emotional reactivity in 20 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and in 16 healthy subjects using the Gambling Task (GT), a model of real-life decision making, and the skin conductance response (SCR). Demographic, neurological, affective, and cognitive parameters were analyzed in MS patients for their effect on decision-making performance. MS patients persisted longer (slope, -3.6%) than the comparison group (slope, -6.4%) in making disadvantageous choices as the GT progressed (p &lt; 0.001), suggesting significant slower learning in MS. Patients with higher Expanded Disability Status Scale scores (EDSS &gt;2.0) showed a different pattern of impairment in the learning process compared with patients with lower functional impairment (EDSS &lt;/=2.0). This slower learning was associated with impaired emotional reactivity (anticipatory SCR 3.9 vs 6.1 microSiemens [microS] for patients vs the comparison group, p &lt; 0.0001; post-choice SCR 3.9 vs 6.2 microS, p &lt; 0.0001), but not with executive dysfunction. Impaired emotional dimensions of behavior (assessed using the Dysexecutive Questionnaire, p &lt; 0.002) also correlated with slower learning. Given the considerable consequences that impaired decision making can have on daily life, we suggest that this factor may contribute to handicap and altered quality of life secondary to MS and is dependent on emotional experience. Ann Neurol 2004."
"Dominant optic atrophy has been associated with mutations in the OPA1 gene, which encodes for a dynamin-related GTPase, a mitochondrial protein implicated in the formation and maintenance of mitochondrial network and morphology. We used phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy to assess calf muscle oxidative metabolism in six patients from two unrelated families carrying the c.2708-2711delTTAG deletion in exon 27 of the OPA1 gene. The rate of postexercise phosphocreatine resynthesis, a measure of mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate production rate, was significantly delayed in the patients. Our in vivo results show for the first time to our knowledge a deficit of oxidative phosphorylation in OPA1-related DOA."
"To examine the antiparkinsonian effects of blocking glycineB receptors, we designed a pilot study testing the potent and selective antagonist, PAMQX, in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated primates. PAMQX had no intrinsic effects but markedly potentiated the antiparkinsonian action of levodopa. In a dose-dependent fashion, coadministration of the glycineB antagonist with levodopa extended the response duration by nearly 60%. It is noteworthy that PAMQX, within a considerable dose range, did not cause ataxia or other side effects. These data indicate that blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors selectively to manipulate dopaminergic-mediated motor responses may be produced effectively by glycineB antagonists."
"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency is a disorder of leucine metabolism that usually presents with recurrent episodes of life-threatening hypoglycemia during early childhood. We report on a 36-year-old woman with seizures, recurrent metabolic disturbances, and severe leukoencephalopathy. The diagnosis was made by analysis of amino acids in urine and serum and was confirmed by demonstration of the deficient enzyme in cultured skin fibroblasts. The patient improved clinically on oral L-carnitine substitution. This treatable condition can remain unrecognized in adults and should be considered a potential cause of leukoencephalopathy."
"There are two known autosomal dominant genes for the hereditary ulcero-mutilating neuropathies: SPTLC1 (hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1) and RAB7 (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B). We report a family with autosomal dominant ulcero-mutilating neuropathy, developing in the teens and characterized by ulcers, amputations, sensory involvement in the feet but no motor features. Sequencing the RAB7 gene showed a novel heterozygous A to C mutation, changing asparagine to threonine at codon 161. The mutation is situated adjacent to a previously identified valine to methionine mutation at codon 162, implying a hotspot for mutations in the highly conserved C terminus of RAB7."
"The mitochondrial respiratory chain comprises 85 subunits, 13 of which are mitochondrial encoded. The synthesis of these 13 proteins requires many nuclear-encoded proteins that participate in mitochondrial DNA replication, transcript production, and a distinctive mitochondrial translation apparatus. We report a patient with agenesis of corpus callosum, dysmorphism, and fatal neonatal lactic acidosis with markedly decreased complex I and IV activity in muscle and liver and a generalized mitochondrial translation defect identified in pulse-label experiments. The defect was associated with marked reduction of the 12S rRNA transcript level likely attributed to a nonsense mutation in the MRPS16 gene. A new group of mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders is proposed, resulting from mutations in nuclear encoded components of the mitochondrial translation apparatus."
"Mutations in the gene encoding fukutin-related protein cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2I. In this multicenter retrospective analysis of 38 patients, 55.3% had cardiac abnormalities, of which 24% had developed cardiac failure. Heterozygotes for the common C826A mutation developed cardiac involvement earlier than homozygotes. All patients initially improved while receiving standard therapy. Independent of cardiac status, forced vital capacity was below 75% in 44.4% of the patients. There was no absolute correlation between skeletal muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy or respiratory insufficiency. These complications are a primary part of this specific type of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, with important implications for management."
"Clinically relevant peripheral neuropathies (such as diabetic and human immunodeficiency virus sensory neuropathies) are characterized by distal axonal degeneration, rather than neuronal death. Here, we describe a novel, endogenous pathway that prevents axonal degeneration. We show that in response to axonal injury, periaxonal Schwann cells release erythropoietin (EPO), which via EPO receptor binding on neurons, prevents axonal degeneration. We demonstrate that the relevant axonal injury signal that stimulates EPO production from surrounding glial cells is nitric oxide. In addition, we show that this endogenous pathway can be therapeutically exploited by administering exogenous EPO. In an animal model of distal axonopathy, systemic EPO administration prevents axonal degeneration, and this is associated with a reduction in limb weakness and neuropathic pain behavior. Our in vivo and in vitro data suggest that EPO prevents axonal degeneration and therefore may be therapeutically useful in a wide variety of human neurological diseases characterized by axonopathy."
"To specifically investigate the effect that large-vessel disease may have on cortical reorganization, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study patients with unilateral hemispheric hypoperfusion and impaired vasomotor reactivity from critical internal carotid or middle cerebral artery disease but without stroke. We hypothesized that when these patients used the hand contralateral to the hypoperfused hemisphere they would show unique activation in motor-related areas of the normally perfused hemisphere, that is, ipsilateral activation. We found that normal performance of two motor tasks was associated with increased ipsilateral hemispheric activation in the patients compared with age-matched controls. In addition, although task difficulty had an effect on ipsilateral activation, the increased ipsilateral activation seen in patients was not dependent on task difficulty. Our findings demonstrate that hemodynamic compromise alone is sufficient to cause atypical ipsilateral activation. This activation may serve to maintain normal motor performance."
"We examined whether treatment with daclizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain, was safe and efficacious in relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis patients. Nineteen ambulatory patients with clinically active disease were treated for 5 to 25 months. Seventeen patients were not responding to other immunotherapies. Daclizumab was generally well tolerated. Sustained clinical improvement (10 patients) or stabilization (9 patients) was observed. Daclizumab treatment produced significant reduction in magnetic resonance imaging activity."
"The association between hippocampal volume (as a presumed index of Alzheimer's disease pathology) with serum total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was studied in 86 elderly subjects with a range of cognitive functions. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but not low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or total cholesterol, was associated with hippocampal volume and dementia. This is compatible with protective effects of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol on hippocampal atrophy and Alzheimer's disease."
"We noted a new clinical syndrome with prominent cerebellar symptoms in apartment building residents in Kamisu, Japan. The well that provided drinking water contained diphenylarsinic acid, a degradation product of diphenylcyanoarsine or diphenylchloroarsine, which were developed for use as chemical weapons, inducing severe vomiting and sneezing. Characteristics of diphenylarsinic acid poisoning include brainstem-cerebellar and cerebral symptoms. Mental retardation associated with brain atrophy in magnetic resonance images was evident in some infants. We must be vigilant to prevent or minimize the effects of further diphenylarsinic acid poisoning in Japan or elsewhere."
"Blood gene expression profiling has been applied to a variety of hematological malignancies, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases. This study applies this approach to genetic diseases without obvious blood phenotypes. Three genetic diseases including tuberous sclerosis complex 2, neurofibromatosis type 1, and Down's syndrome were compared with a group of healthy controls. RNA from whole blood was surveyed using Affymetrix U133A arrays. Each disease was associated with a unique gene expression pattern in blood that can be accurately distinguished by a classifier. Genes on chromosome 21 were overexpressed in Down's syndrome, and genes controlling cell cycle and proliferation were associated with tuberous sclerosis complex type 2 or neurofibromatosis type 1. A subset of genes involved in cardiac development or remodeling were overexpressed in patients with Down's syndrome and congenital heart defects. These findings suggest that blood gene expression profiling on a broader basis might be useful for genetic disease screening/diagnosis and might help elucidate mechanisms and pathways that lead to genotype-phenotype differences."
"The clinical characteristics of childhood-onset restless legs syndrome are described. Thirty-two of 538 subjects (5.9%) examined in our sleep disorders center received diagnoses of restless legs syndrome. They were classified based on published criteria into probable (n = 9/32 or 28%) and definite (n = 23/32 or 78%) categories. Apart from an earlier age of diagnosis of the probable group, no differences were found between the two categories. Sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia was the most common symptoms, being present in 28 of 32 subjects (87.5%). Inattentiveness was seen in 8 of 32 subjects (25%). Serum ferritin levels were measured in 24 of 32 subjects and were below 50 microg/L in 20 of 24 subjects (83%). A family history of restless legs syndrome was present in 23 of 32 (72%) subjects, with mothers almost three times more likely to be affected than fathers (p = 0.02). We conclude that iron deficiency and a strong family history are characteristic of childhood-onset restless legs syndrome."
"Polymyositis is a CD8(+) T-cell-mediated disease. T-cell clonal expansions are observed at disease onset, but little is known about their persistence over time. Qualitative and quantitative spectratyping demonstrated that PM relapse features dramatically perturbed blood T-cell repertoires but is not associated with the emergence of new T-cell clones. It is striking that patients in remission also maintained all their T-cell repertoire abnormalities. The clonally expanded T-cells displayed a memory phenotype, expressed intracellular perforin, and dramatically responded to IL-2, showing a potential to be reactivated upon appropriate conditions. These results indicate that persistent T-cell clonal expansion is an important feature of polymyositis."
"During speech comprehension the auditory association cortex in the superior temporal cortex is involved in perceptual analysis of the speech signal, whereas the basal language area in the inferior temporal cortex mediates access to word meaning. Disruption of the interaction between the superior and inferior temporal cortices is one factor that may determine recovery from aphasic stroke. We used positron emission tomography to investigate semantic processing within inferior temporal cortex in control subjects and after infarction involving the superior temporal cortex. In the control group, semantic decision making on clear speech activated both anterior fusiform gyri. Chronic aphasic patients were impaired at the task and demonstrated reduced activation within the left anterior fusiform gyrus. A similar pattern of impaired performance and reduced left anterior fusiform gyrus activation was observed when control subjects heard perceptually degraded speech. Performance in both groups predicted activity in the right anterior fusiform gyrus and the temporal poles, where accuracy linearly correlated with activity. These results demonstrate that the function of the basal language area is sensitive to changes in the quality of perceptual input. In addition, different profiles of response observed in each hemisphere suggest distinct contributions of both left and right inferior temporal cortices to the semantic processing of speech."
"We examined the effects of C-peptide replacement on unmyelinated fiber function in the hind paw, sural nerve C-fiber morphometry, sciatic nerve neurotrophins, and the expression of neurotrophic receptors and content of neuropeptides in dorsal root ganglia in type 1 diabetic BB/Wor-rats. C-peptide replacement from onset of diabetes had no effect on hyperglycemia, but it significantly prevented progressive thermal hyperalgesia and prevented C-fiber atrophy, degeneration, and loss. These findings were associated with preventive effects on impaired availability of nerve growth factor and neurotrophin 3 in the sciatic nerve and significant prevention of perturbed expression of insulin, insulin growth factor-1, nerve growth factor, and neurotrophin 3 receptors in dorsal root ganglion cells. These beneficial effects translated into prevention of the decreased content of dorsal root ganglia nociceptive peptides such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide. From these findings we conclude that replacement of insulinomimetic C-peptide prevents abnormalities of neurotrophins, their receptors, and nociceptive neuropeptides in type 1 BB/Wor-rats, resulting in the prevention of C-fiber pathology and nociceptive sensory nerve dysfunction. The data indicate that perturbed insulin/C-peptide action plays an important pathogenetic role in nociceptive sensory neuropathy and that C-peptide replacement may be of benefit in treating painful diabetic neuropathy in insulin-deficient diabetic conditions."
"Involuntary movements, or dyskinesia, represent a debilitating complication of levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease. Although changes affecting D(1) and D(2) dopamine receptors have been studied in association with this condition, no causal relationship has yet been established. Taking advantage of a monkey brain bank constituted to study levodopa-induced dyskinesia, we report changes affecting D(1) and D(2) dopamine receptors within the striatum of normal, parkinsonian, nondyskinetic levodopa-treated parkinsonian, and dyskinetic levodopa-treated parkinsonian animals. Whereas D(1) receptor expression itself is not related to dyskinesia, D(1) sensitivity per D(1) receptor measured by D(1) agonist-induced [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding is linearly related to dyskinesia. Moreover, the striata of dyskinetic animals show higher levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and of the dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32kDa (DARPP-32). Our data suggest that levodopa-induced dyskinesia results from increased dopamine D(1) receptor-mediated transmission at the level of the direct pathway."
"It is well established that the reorganizational potential of the developing human brain is superior to that of the adult brain, but whether age-dependent differences exist already in the prenatal and perinatal period is not known. We have studied sensorimotor reorganization in 34 patients with congenital hemiparesis (age range, 5-27 years), using transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging during simple hand movements. Underlying pathologies were brain malformations (first and second trimester lesions; n = 10), periventricular brain lesions (early third trimester lesions; n = 12), and middle cerebral artery infarctions (late third trimester lesions; n = 12). Of this cohort, eight patients with malformations and all patients with periventricular lesions have been published previously. In all three groups of pathologies, transcranial magnetic stimulation identified patients in whom the paretic hand was controlled via ipsilateral corticospinal projections from the contralesional hemisphere (n = 16). In these patients, the motor dysfunction of the paretic hand correlated significantly with the timing period of the underlying brain lesion. This demonstrates that the efficacy of reorganization with ipsilateral corticospinal tracts indeed decreases during pregnancy."
"Selective learning (SL), the ability to select items to learn from among other items, engages cognitive control, which is purportedly mediated by the frontal cortex and its circuitry. Using incentive-based auditory word recall and expository discourse tasks, we studied the efficiency of SL in children ages 6 to 16 years who had sustained severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) at least 1 year earlier. We hypothesized that SL would be compromised by severe TBI. Results indicated that children with severe TBI performed significantly worse than age-matched typically developing children on word- and discourse-level measures of SL efficiency with no significant group differences in number of items recalled from auditory word lists or declarative facts. We conclude that severe TBI disrupts incentive-based cognitive control processes, possibly due to involvement of frontal neural networks."
"Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy is an autosomal recessive multisystemic disorder caused by thymidine phosphorylase deficiency. Whereas the pathomechanism of the secondary mitochondrial dysfunction has been extensively studied, that of the leukoencephalopathy has not been elucidated. We hypothesized that the white matter hyperintensities on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images reflect disturbance of blood-brain barrier function. Albumin immunohistochemistry disclosed quantitative (p &lt; 0.01) and qualitative differences between the mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy and control brains, indicating that loss of thymidine phosphorylase function impairs the integrity of the blood-brain barrier."
"Vertical eye deviation in hypoxic coma is considered to be rare. In contrast, we found that in a consecutive series of 50 postresuscitation comatose patients, 28 (56.0%) developed tonic upward or downward eye deviation. We suggest that both the upward and the downward deviations resulted from diffuse cerebrocerebellar damage sparing the brainstem. Upward deviation is an early sign, whereas downward deviation appears later and generally implies a transition to the vegetative state."
"We molecularly characterized human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) present in pure populations of astrocytes, macrophages, and multinucleated giant cells isolated using laser capture microdissection from brain tissue of two patients who died with HIV-associated dementia. The V3 region of the HIV-1 envelope (env) gene was amplified from the pure-cell populations, and multiple clones were sequenced. In both patients, the V3 env sequences were distinct in astrocytes compared with neighboring macrophages or multinucleated giant cells and were characteristic of CCR5-using (R5) HIV-1. These results demonstrate cell-specific compartmentalization of distinct R5-like viral strains in the central nervous system microenvironment."
"Nemaline myopathy is a human neuromuscular disorder associated with muscle weakness, Z-line accumulations (rods), and myofibrillar disorganization. Disease-causing mutations have been identified in genes encoding muscle thin filament proteins: actin, nebulin, slow troponin T, betaTropomyosin, and alphaTropomyosin(slow). Skeletal muscle expresses three tropomyosin (Tm) isoforms from separate genes: alphaTm(fast)(alphaTm, TPM1), betaTm (TPM2), and alphaTm(slow) (gammaTm, TPM3). In this article, we show that the level of betaTm, but not alphaTm(fast) protein, is reduced in human patients with mutations in alphaTm(slow) and in a transgenic mouse model of alphaTm(slow)(Met9Arg) nemaline myopathy. A postnatal time course of Tm expression in muscles of the mice indicated that the onset of alphaTm(slow)(Met9Arg) expression coincides with the decline of betaTm. Reduction of betaTm levels is independent of the degree of pathology (rods) within a muscle and is detected before the onset of muscle weakness. Thus, reduction in the level of betaTm represents an early clinical diagnostic marker for alphaTm(slow)-based mutations. Examinations of tropomyosin dimer formation using either recombinant proteins or sarcomeric extracts show that the mutation reduces the formation of the preferred alpha/beta heterodimer. We suggest this perturbation of tropomyosin isoform levels and dimer preference alters sarcomeric thin filament dynamics and contributes to muscle weakness in nemaline myopathy."
"Despite many refinements in current therapeutic strategies, the overall prognosis for a patient with glioblastoma is dismal. Neural precursor cells (NPCs) are capable of tracking glioma tumors and thus could be used to deliver therapeutic molecules. We have engineered mouse NPCs to deliver a secreted form of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (S-TRAIL); S-TRAIL is optimized to selectively kill neoplastic cells. Furthermore, we have developed means to simultaneously monitor both the migration of NSCs toward gliomas and the changes in glioma burden in real time. Using a highly malignant human glioma model expressing Renilla luciferase (Rluc), intracranially implanted NPC-FL-sTRAIL expressing both firefly luciferase (Fluc) and S-TRAIL was shown to migrate into the tumors and have profound antitumor effects. These studies demonstrate the potential of NPCs as therapeutically effective delivery vehicles for the treatment of gliomas and also provide important tools to evaluate the migration of NPCs and changes in glioma burden in vivo."
"Many studies have shown a protective effect of cigarette smoking on Parkinson's disease. However, criticism has been raised concerning confounding by genetic factors. We investigated the associations between Parkinson's disease and smoking, alcohol, coffee, area of living, and education in a co-twin control study. Because twins are matched for genetic and familial environmental factors, this design controls for confounding by these factors. We also examined control subjects unrelated to cases. Exposure information was taken from questionnaires answered in the 1960s and 1970s. Parkinson's disease cases were identified through the Swedish Inpatient Discharge Register (IDR) and the Cause of Death Register. In the unrelated control subject comparison, 476 Parkinson's disease cases and 2,380 control subjects were included. In the co-twin control comparison, 415 same-sex twin pairs were included. There was an inverse association between smoking and Parkinson's disease using unrelated control subjects and co-twin control cases. There was no association between Parkinson's disease and alcohol, coffee, or area of living. High educational level was associated with Parkinson's disease in the unrelated control subject comparison but not in the co-twin control comparison. We confirm the protective effect of smoking on Parkinson's disease and establish that the association is only partially explained by genetic and familial environmental factors."
"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired communication and social interaction and may be accompanied by mental retardation and epilepsy. Its cause remains unknown, despite evidence that genetic, environmental, and immunological factors may play a role in its pathogenesis. To investigate whether immune-mediated mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of autism, we used immunocytochemistry, cytokine protein arrays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to study brain tissues and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from autistic patients and determined the magnitude of neuroglial and inflammatory reactions and their cytokine expression profiles. Brain tissues from cerebellum, midfrontal, and cingulate gyrus obtained at autopsy from 11 patients with autism were used for morphological studies. Fresh-frozen tissues available from seven patients and CSF from six living autistic patients were used for cytokine protein profiling. We demonstrate an active neuroinflammatory process in the cerebral cortex, white matter, and notably in cerebellum of autistic patients. Immunocytochemical studies showed marked activation of microglia and astroglia, and cytokine profiling indicated that macrophage chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and tumor growth factor-beta1, derived from neuroglia, were the most prevalent cytokines in brain tissues. CSF showed a unique proinflammatory profile of cytokines, including a marked increase in MCP-1. Our findings indicate that innate neuroimmune reactions play a pathogenic role in an undefined proportion of autistic patients, suggesting that future therapies might involve modifying neuroglial responses in the brain."
"Oxidative stress may contribute to the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We therefore examined prospectively whether individuals who regularly use supplements of the antioxidant vitamins E and C have a lower risk of ALS than nonusers. The study population comprised 957,740 individuals 30 years of age or older participating in the American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study II. Information on vitamin use was collected at time of recruitment in 1982; participants then were followed up for ALS deaths from 1989 through 1998 via linkage with the National Death Index. During the follow-up, we documented 525 deaths from ALS. Regular use of vitamin E supplements was associated with a lower risk of dying of ALS. The age- and smoking-adjusted relative risk was 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-1.41) among occasional users, 0.59 (95% CI, 0.36-0.96) in regular users for less than 10 years, and 0.38 (95% CI, 0.16-0.92) in regular users for 10 years or more as compared with nonusers of vitamin E (p for trend = 0.004). In contrast, no significant associations were found for use of vitamin C or multivitamins. These results suggest that vitamin E supplementation could have a role in ALS prevention."
"Because cellular and extract data have suggested that N-acetylaspartate (NAA) reflects neuronal mitochondrial function, we evaluated the quantitative relationship between NAA, high-energy phosphates, and ADP levels in the hippocampus and occipital lobe of 15 healthy volunteers. The ADP levels are calculated using the creatine kinase equilibrium and quantified (31)P and total creatine measurements. Using high-field quantitative MR spectroscopic imaging, we find that NAA and ADP concentrations in the hippocampal body are 9.7 +/- 1.5mM and 35 +/- 8microM, respectively. In the occipital lobe, NAA and ADP are 11.9 +/- 1.9mM and 32 +/- 12microM, respectively. There is a statistically significant positive correlation between NAA and ADP, with R = +0.80, p &lt; 2 x 10(-7)in the hippocampal body. In an adjacent hippocampal NAA voxel, the correlation between NAA and ADP had a R = +0.62, p &lt; 3 x 10(-4), whereas, in the occipital lobe, R = +0.67, p &lt; 5 x 10(-5). There was no significant relationship NAA and either ATP or phosphocreatine. This positive relationship of NAA with ADP suggests a directional process wherein energetics may modulate mitochondrial function."
"Neocortical neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are hallmark neuropathological lesions of dementia. Concomitant cerebrovascular lesions increase dementia severity in patients meeting neuropathological criteria for Alzheimer's disease and contribute to cognitive impairment in persons with mild entorhinal Alzheimer lesions. This study investigates whether individuals with sparse neocortical neuritic plaques experience increased odds of crossing the threshold to clinical dementia when they have coexistent cerebrovascular lesions. Dementia examinations were given to 3,734 men during the 1991-1993 Honolulu-Asia Aging Study examination and to 2,603 men during the 1994-1996 examination. Lesion quantification was done without clinical data. Among 333 autopsied men, 120 had dementia, 115 had marginal results, and 98 had normal cognition. In men with neurofibrillary tangles, dementia frequency increased with increasing neuritic plaque density, and increased further in the presence of cerebrovascular lesions. The association was strongest in men with sparse neuritic plaques (1-3/mm(2)) where dementia frequency more than doubled with coexistent cerebrovascular lesions (45 vs 20%). Among all dementia cases, 24% were linked to cerebrovascular lesions. Findings suggest cerebrovascular lesions are associated with a marked excess of dementia in cases with low neuritic plaque frequency. Prevention of cerebrovascular lesions may be critically important in preserving late-life cognitive function."
"Early anatomically based models of language consisted of an arcuate tract connecting Broca's speech and Wernicke's comprehension centers; a lesion of the tract resulted in conduction aphasia. However, the heterogeneous clinical presentations of conduction aphasia suggest a greater complexity of perisylvian anatomical connections than allowed for in the classical anatomical model. This article re-explores perisylvian language connectivity using in vivo diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging tractography. Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging data from 11 right-handed healthy male subjects were averaged, and the arcuate fasciculus of the left hemisphere reconstructed from this data using an interactive dissection technique. Beyond the classical arcuate pathway connecting Broca's and Wernicke's areas directly, we show a previously undescribed, indirect pathway passing through inferior parietal cortex. The indirect pathway runs parallel and lateral to the classical arcuate fasciculus and is composed of an anterior segment connecting Broca's territory with the inferior parietal lobe and a posterior segment connecting the inferior parietal lobe to Wernicke's territory. This model of two parallel pathways helps explain the diverse clinical presentations of conduction aphasia. The anatomical findings are also relevant to the evolution of language, provide a framework for Lichtheim's symptom-based neurological model of aphasia, and constrain, anatomically, contemporary connectionist accounts of language."
"Patients with the myopathic form of carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) deficiency typically experience muscle pain, cramps, and myoglobinuria during prolonged exercise. It has been suggested that carriers of CPT2 gene mutations also may have milder clinical symptoms, but fatty acid oxidation (FAO) has never been investigated in vivo in this group. We studied fuel utilization by indirect calorimetry and stable isotope methodology in four patients with CPT II deficiency, three subjects who carried one CPT2 gene mutation, and five healthy control subjects. Cycle exercise at a constant workload of 50% of maximal oxygen uptake capacity was used to facilitate FAO. We found that in vivo oxidation of long-chain fatty acids was normal at rest but severely impaired during prolonged, low-intensity exercise in patients with CPT II deficiency, and that two of the single CPT2 gene mutation carriers, who displayed symptoms of CPT II deficiency, had an FAO comparable with the patients. These results indicate that residual CPT II activity is sufficient to maintain long-chain FAO at rest in CPT II deficiency but not to increase FAO during exercise. The findings also suggest that single CPT2 gene mutations may exert a dominant-negative effect on the tetrameric CPT II protein."
"Intracytoplasmic aggregation of alpha-synuclein protein as Lewy bodies in the brainstem neurons is diagnostic for Parkinson's disease, whereas if this process also occurs in the cortical neurons, it is considered pathognomonic for dementia with Lewy bodies. However, the link between alpha-synuclein incorporation into inclusions, neuronal dysfunction, and clinical symptoms needs to be clarified. Another important issue of the pathogenetic puzzle is to understand where alpha-synuclein pathology begins and how it progresses in the brain. To study this, we collected all cases from autopsy material (N = 904) that had alpha-synuclein pathology in the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, substantia nigra, and/or basal forebrain nuclei. In this way, our study has a unique design because the selection of material is entirely based on the presence of alpha-synuclein pathology regardless of clinical phenotype. Retrospective clinical assessment then showed that only 32 (30%) of 106 alpha-synuclein-positive cases were diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disorder. The distribution or load of alpha-synuclein pathology did not permit a dependable postmortem diagnosis of extrapyramidal symptoms or cognitive impairment. Some neurologically unimpaired cases had a reasonable burden of alpha-synuclein pathology in both brainstem and cortical areas, suggesting that alpha-synuclein-positive structures are not definite markers of neuronal dysfunction."
"Infants born prematurely may develop neurocognitive deficits without an obvious cause. Oxygen, which is widely used in neonatal medicine, constitutes one possible contributing neurotoxic factor, because it can trigger neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain of rodents. We hypothesized that two caspase-1-processed cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18, are involved in oxygen-induced neuronal cell death. Six-day-old Wistar rats or C57/BL6 mice were exposed to 80% oxygen for various time periods (2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours). Neuronal cell death in the brain, as assessed by Fluoro-Jade B and silver staining, peaked at 12 to 24 hours and was preceded by a marked increase in mRNA and protein levels of caspase 1, IL-1beta, IL-18, and IL-18 receptor alpha (IL-18Ralpha). Intraperitoneal injection of recombinant human IL-18-binding protein, a specific inhibitor of IL-18, attenuated hyperoxic brain injury. Mice deficient in IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK-4), which is pivotal for both IL-1beta and IL-18 signal transduction, were protected against oxygen-mediated neurotoxicity. These findings causally link IL-1beta and IL-18 to hyperoxia-induced cell death in the immature brain. These cytokines might serve as useful targets for therapeutic approaches aimed at preserving neuronal function in the immature brain, which is exquisitely sensitive to a variety of iatrogenic measures including oxygen."
"We studied 14 patients with neurological manifestations of subacute combined degeneration (SCD) and 40 control patients not cobalamin (Cbl)-deficient. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of Cbl deficiency (Cbl and total homocysteine [tHCYS] levels) and the CSF levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were measured. Significantly higher levels of tHCYS and TNF-alpha, and significantly lower levels of Cbl and EGF were found in the SCD patients. In human CSF, as in human serum and the rat central nervous system, decreased Cbl concentrations are concomitant with an increase in TNF-alpha and a decrease in EGF-levels. Ann Neurol 2004;56:886-890."
"Using anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we studied the pattern of brain lateralization during spoken and written language tasks, in an 11-year-old girl who underwent a left occipitotemporal resection for a Sturge-Weber angioma at the age of 4 years, that is, after the development of speech but before the acquisition of reading. We observed a selective and successful shift to the right hemisphere of the visual component of reading, particularly the Visual Word Form Area, whereas the verbal components remained strongly left-lateralized. This emphasizes the potential utility of a precise functional and developmental cartography of language for the surgical treatment of focal brain lesions in children."
"Impaired glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier results in Glut-1 deficiency syndrome (Glut-1 DS, OMIM 606777), characterized by infantile seizures, developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, spasticity, ataxia, and hypoglycorrhachia. We studied 16 new Glut-1 deficiency syndrome patients focusing on clinical and laboratory features, molecular genetics, genotype-phenotype correlation, and treatment. These patients were classified phenotypically into three groups. The mean cerebrospinal fluid glucose concentration was 33.1 +/- 4.9mg/dl equal to 37% of the simultaneous blood glucose concentration. The mean cerebrospinal fluid lactate concentration was 1.0 +/- 0.3mM, which was less than the normal mean value of 1.63mM. The mean V(max) for the 3-O-methyl-D-glucose uptake into erythrocytes was 996 fmol/10(6) red blood cells per second, significantly less (54 +/- 11%; t test, p &lt; 0.05) than the mean control value of 1,847. The mean Km value for the patient group (1.4 +/- 0.5mM) was similar to the control group (1.7 +/- 0.5mM; t test, p &gt; 0.05). We identified 16 rearrangements, including seven missense, one nonsense, one insertion, and seven deletion mutations. Fourteen were novel mutations. There were no obvious correlations between phenotype, genotype, or biochemical measures. The ketogenic diet produced good seizure control."
"Using positron emission tomography and [(11)C](R)-PK11195, a marker of ""peripheral benzodiazepine sites"" that is upregulated on activated microglia during progressive tissue pathology, we show increased binding of [(11)C](R)-PK11195 in frontotemporal lobar degeneration in the typically affected frontotemporal brain regions. This implies the presence of an active glial response reflecting progressive neuronal degeneration. It also suggests that increased [(11)C](R)-PK11195 binding, previously demonstrated for Alzheimer's disease, may occur independently from increased amyloid plaque formation, given that it is not a characteristic feature of frontotemporal lobar degeneration."
"Friedreich ataxia patients are homozygous for expanded GAA triplet-repeats containing 66 to 1,700 triplets. We report two patients with delayed-onset, hyperreflexia and gradually progressive disease. Both were heterozygous for large expansions and also carried alleles with 44 and 66 triplet-repeats, respectively. Due to somatic instability, 15% (GAA-44) and 75% (GAA-66) of cells contained alleles with &gt;/=66 triplet-repeats, constituting a plausible mechanism for their mild phenotype. A sibling with a stable GAA-37 allele and a large expansion was clinically normal. Instability of borderline alleles confers a risk for Friedreich ataxia, and the range of pathogenic alleles is broader than previously recognized."
"Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging can acquire quantitative information on the microstructural integrity of white matter structures and depict brain connectivity in vivo based on the behavior of water diffusion. Diffusion tensor imaging-derived tractography has been used for virtual dissection of the fornix and cingulum in healthy subjects, but not in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Eight patients with medically intractable TLE and unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis and nine healthy control subjects were imaged using diffusion tensor imaging. Fiber tracking was performed to delineate the fornix and cingulum, which were quantitatively analyzed. Bilateral symmetrical reduction in fractional anisotropy was observed in the fornix of patients with TLE, together with an increase in water mobility perpendicular to the axis of the fibers. The findings in the cingulum are similar to those of the fornix with the exception of significantly increased bulk diffusivity in the latter. We observed strikingly symmetrical bilateral abnormalities of axonal integrity in the fornix and cingulum in a series of patients with unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis. Our findings suggest that TLE with unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis is associated with bilateral limbic system pathology."
"To evaluate whether the chemosensitivity of primary central nervous system lymphomas to water-soluble drugs could result from improved drug delivery, we quantitatively assessed pharmacokinetic factors in seven patients. The capillary permeability surface product was found to be significantly increased in central nervous system lymphomas compared with glioblastoma multiforme, medulloblastomas, and metastases. Tumoral blood flow was significantly greater than in normal white matter. Our results suggest favorable pharmacokinetics to water- and lipid-soluble drugs in primary central nervous system lymphomas."
"Children affected with the inherited tumor predisposition syndrome, neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), are prone to the development of low-grade astrocytic optic pathway tumors (optic pathway glioma [OPG]). Previously, we developed a model of NF1-associated astrocytoma (GFAPCre; Nf1(flox/mut) mice) in which mice develop optic nerve and chiasm glioma. To define the molecular pathogenesis of OPG, we used this mouse model to study the natural history of OPG formation using immunohistological and radiographic approaches. We observed that whereas astrocyte hyperplasia is present in the optic nerves associated with gross optic nerve thickening at 3 weeks of age, overt neoplastic changes were not seen until 2 months of age. Astrocyte proliferation was maximal between 3 weeks and 2 months of age, suggesting that the most rapid period of growth occurs early. Mouse OPG tumors were detected by magnetic resonance imaging at 2 months of age and exhibited contrast enhancement, as seen in human OPG. In addition, the mouse OPG tumors exhibited expression of proteins associated with astroglial progenitors, including nestin and brain lipid binding protein. Last, we observed neovascularization and microglial cell infiltration by 3 weeks of age before overt neoplastic transformation, suggesting that these cellular changes participate in the early stages of tumor formation."
"Neuroinflammatory glial response may contribute to degenerative processes in Parkinson's disease (PD). To investigate changes in microglial activity associated with changes in the presynaptic dopamine transporter density in the PD brain in vivo, we studied 10 early-stage drug-naive PD patients twice using positron emission tomography with a radiotracer for activated microglia [(11)C](R)-PK11195 and a dopamine transporter marker [(11)C]CFT. Quantitative levels of binding potentials (BPs) of [(11)C](R)-PK11195 and [(11)C]CFT in the nigrostriatal pathway were estimated by compartment analyses. The levels of [(11)C](R)-PK11195 BP in the midbrain contralateral to the clinically affected side were significantly higher in PD than that in 10 age-matched healthy subjects. The midbrain [(11)C](R)-PK11195 BP levels significantly correlated inversely with [(11)C]CFT BP in the putamen and correlated positively with the motor severity assessed by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale in PD. In healthy subjects, the [(11)C](R)-PK11195 BP in the thalamus and midbrain showed an age-dependent increase. In vivo demonstration of parallel changes in microglial activation and corresponding dopaminergic terminal loss in the affected nigrostriatal pathway in early PD supports that neuroinflammatory responses by intrinsic microglia contribute significantly to the progressive degeneration process of the disease and suggests the importance of early therapeutic intervention with neuroprotective drugs."
"Hypocretin/orexin deficiency appears to be a consistent feature of narcolepsy with a putative autoimmune mechanism involved. We treated four hypocretin/orexin-deficient narcolepsy patients with intravenous immunoglobulins and assessed the efficacy by repeated polysomnographies and questionnaires. Three patients received the treatment within a few months after acute onset of narcolepsy. A clear improvement in the frequency and severity of cataplexy was obtained with a benefic effect up to 7 months without any anticataplectics drugs at follow-up. Our findings point to the importance of early diagnosis of narcolepsy, which once treated quickly may modify its long-term outlook."
"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is the prime autoimmune manifestation of thymomas. We investigated the generation of T cells with a regulatory phenotype (T(R)) in thymomas with and without associated MG. In patients with MG(+) thymomas, maturation and export of T(R) cells but not of other T-cell subsets was significantly reduced. We conclude that imbalance between effector and regulatory T cells in thymomas may be involved in modulation of onset and/or severity of MG."
"Muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies are found in some patients with ""seronegative"" myasthenia gravis (MG), but how they cause myasthenic symptoms is not clear. We visualized acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and complement component 3 (C3) in muscle biopsies from 10 Japanese MG patients with MuSK antibodies, compared with 42 with AChR antibodies. The AChR density was not significantly decreased in MuSK antibody (Ab)-positive end-plates compared with AChR antibody-positive end-plates, and C3 was detected in only two of eight MuSK Ab-positive patients. MuSK antibodies do not appear to cause substantial AChR loss, complement deposition, or morphological damage. Effects on MuSK function need to be explored."
"Neuroimaging studies of language networks in patients with brain lesions of the left language-dominant hemisphere have shown activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). We tested the functional relevance of right IFG activation using neuroimaging-guided repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to disturb language function over bilateral IFG in right-handed patients with brain tumors and controls. All subjects were susceptible to TMS over the left IFG. In patients, this susceptibility correlated with left-sided the degree of language lateralization to the left. Those patients with lowest dominance were also susceptible to right-sided TMS proving relevant language function of the right IFG."
We discovered intronic mutations in two episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) families: a four-nucleotide GAGT deletion at IVS41+(3-6) and a single nucleotide insertion (insT) at IVS24+3. We expressed minigenes harboring the mutations in cell lines to demonstrate exon skipping from the deletion mutation and the activation of a cryptic splice donor site from the insertion mutation. The identification of these disease-causing mutations expands the spectrum of EA2 mutations and emphasizes the importance of intronic sequences in regulating gene expression.
"Fever can provoke ""febrile"" seizures (FS). Because complex FS may promote development of temporal lobe epilepsy, understanding their mechanisms is clinically important. Using an immature rodent model and transgenic technology, we examined the role of interleukin-1beta, (IL-1beta), a pyrogenic, proinflammatory cytokine, in FS. IL-1beta receptor-deficient mice were resistant to experimental FS. This resistance appeared independent of genetic background and was attributed to lack of IL-1beta signaling, because exogenous cytokine reduced seizure threshold in wild-type but not receptor-deficient mice independent of strain. In addition, high IL-1beta doses induced seizures only in IL-1beta receptor-expressing mice. These data indicate that IL-1beta signaling contributes critically to fever-induced hyperexcitability underlying FS, constituting a potential target for their prevention."
"We report a young girl with a phenotype combining early-onset myopathy and a progeria. She had myopathy and marked axial weakness during the first year of life; progeroid features, including growth failure, sclerodermatous skin changes, and osteolytic lesions, developed later. We identified the underlying cause to be a hitherto unreported de novo missense mutation in the LMNA gene (S143F) encoding the nuclear envelope proteins lamins A and C. Although LMNA mutations have been known to cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, this is the first report of a patient combining features of these two phenotypes because of a single mutation in LMNA."
"Fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a recently described condition consisting of tremor, ataxia, parkinsonism, and executive dysfunction, presenting predominantly in male carriers of a fragile X mental retardation 1 premutation. In this report, we present premutation carrier sisters in whom severity of clinical signs correlated with a molecular pattern of X-inactivation favoring higher expression of the premutation allele. In these women with a common genetic background, we suggest that symptom severity may be dictated by X-inactivation, and thus a higher percentage of cells producing the premutation-containing mRNA result in increased toxicity and disease."
"Futility studies are designed to test new treatments over a short period in a small number of subjects to determine if those treatments are worthy of larger and longer term studies, or if they should be abandoned. An appropriate outcome measure for a neuroprotection futility study in Parkinson's disease (sensitive to tracking disease progression in the short-term) has not been determined. Data sets from three clinical trials were used to compare Parkinson's disease outcome measures. Total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS; Mentation + Activities of Daily Living + Motor) change and Motor plus Activities of Daily Living UPDRS change, measured in untreated patients, required the smallest sample sizes of all the outcome measures explored. Other outcomes (UPDRS Motor, UPDRS Activities of Daily Living, and time to need levodopa) required somewhat larger sample sizes. Futility designs in Parkinson's disease are feasible in terms of short duration and small sample size requirements, and this design is being applied in two ongoing Parkinson's disease studies to select agents for future larger and longer term neuroprotection studies."
"Impaired word retrieval is a main symptom of primary progressive aphasia (PPA). The cognitive features of this impairment in PPA are poorly understood. We studied 12 patients with PPA (6 English-speaking and 6 Dutch-speaking), 7 patients with early-stage clinically probable Alzheimer's disease (PRAD), 5 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 15 age-matched, cognitively intact, control subjects. Subjects had to name a picture (the probe), which was preceded by a written word (the prime) that could be the correct name of the picture, a noun belonging to the same semantic subcategory (related prime), a semantically unrelated noun (unrelated prime), or a pseudoword (neutral control). Naming latencies were longer in PPA and PRAD patients than in control subjects. Critically, the interaction between group and prime type was highly significant. PPA patients named the probe more slowly after a related compared with an unrelated prime. In contrast, PRAD patients, mild cognitive impairment patients, and healthy control subjects tended to name the probe faster when it was preceded by a related prime. The semantic interference effect in PPA generalized across languages and PPA subtypes. Selection among competing word forms sharing a same semantic field is abnormal in PPA. The semantic interference effect constitutes a positive distinguishing feature between PPA and PRAD."
"Optic neuritis presentations are thought to have a better prognosis. The aim of our study was to compare conversion to multiple sclerosis on the different topographies of CISs. We prospectively evaluated 320 patients with CISs (123 with optic neuritis, 78 with brainstem syndromes, 89 with spinal cord syndromes, and 30 with other topographies) who were observed for a median of 39 months. Patients underwent brain MRI within 3 months of their first attack and again 12 months later. Conversion to multiple sclerosis determined either clinically or by MRI was evaluated according to topography. Baseline MRI was normal in 49.2% of patients with optic neuritis compared with 24% in brainstem syndromes, 24% in spinal cord syndromes, and 18.5% in other syndromes. Optic neuritis behaved differently from the other CISs for lower conversion to clinically definite multiple sclerosis and smaller proportion of patients fulfilling MRI dissemination in space, time, or both. Nevertheless, when only patients with abnormal cranial MRI results at baseline were selected, no differences for clinical or MRI conversion were found. Optic neuritis has a smaller risk for conversion to multiple sclerosis. Nevertheless, MRI at baseline, not CIS topography, appears to be the crucial issue at multiple sclerosis presentation."
"Anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (anti-MAG) neuropathy is a chronic demyelinating neuropathy with predominant involvement of large sensory fibers and deposits of IgM and complement on sural nerve myelinated fibers. We assessed the presence of IgM deposits on skin myelinated nerve fibers and the involvement of unmyelinated axons in anti-MAG neuropathy. Skin biopsies were performed in 14 patients with anti-MAG neuropathy, in 8 patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), and in 2 patients with IgM paraproteinemic neuropathy. Biopsies were taken at the proximal thigh in 20 patients, at the distal leg in 21 patients, at the proximal arm in 13 patients, and at the hand or fingertip in 10 patients. We found IgM deposits on dermal myelinated fibers in all anti-MAG neuropathy patients, with a greater prevalence at the distal site of the extremities. Deposits were located throughout the length of the fibers and at the paranodal loops. CIDP and IgM paraproteinemic neuropathies did not show any deposit of IgM. Anti-MAG neuropathy and CIPD patients showed a decrease in epidermal nerve fiber density reflecting an associated axonal loss. In anti-MAG neuropathy, both large- and small-diameter nerve fibers are affected, and specific deposits of IgM are found on skin myelinated nerve fibers."
"In patients with the frontal variant of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (fv-FTLD), behavioral abnormalities may vary from apathy with motor slowness (apathetic form) to disinhibition with agitation (disinhibited form). These clinical presentations may be related to specific regional cerebral dysfunction and to deficit in the serotoninergic system. We studied cerebral glucose uptake using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography in 18 patients fulfilling clinical criteria for fv-FTLD and showing, respectively, an apathetic or disinhibited behavioral syndrome. In eight of these patients, we also evaluated the 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptor cerebral receptor distribution with [(11)C]MDL and positron emission tomography. We found a reduction of frontal glucose metabolism in the whole group of fv-FTLD patients. Apathetic syndrome was associated with a prevalent dorsolateral and frontal medial hypometabolism, whereas the disinhibited syndrome demonstrated a selective hypometabolism in interconnected limbic structures (the cingulate cortex, hippocampus/amygdala, and accumbens nucleus). The in vivo measurements of [(11)C]MDL indicated a significant reduction of 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptors in orbitofrontal, frontal medial, and cingulate cortices. These (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography changes can be considered as specific functional markers of the different behavioral presentations in fv-FTLD. The serotoninergic system dysfunction provides a rationale for therapeutic trials with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors."
"Presenilin-1 (PS-1) mutations can cause Pick's disease without evidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We describe a family with a PS-1 M146L mutation and both Pick bodies and AD. Sarkosyl-insoluble hyperphosphorylated tau showed three bands consistent with AD, although dephosphorylation showed primarily three-repeat isoforms. M146L mutant PS-1 may predispose to both Pick's disease and AD by affecting multiple intracellular pathways involving tau phosphorylation and amyloid metabolism."
"Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with a loss of neurons from the midbrain. The cause of PD is unknown, but it is established that certain neurotoxins can cause similar syndromes. The brain is normally protected from these noxious blood-borne chemicals by the blood-brain barrier which includes specialized proteins on the inside of blood vessels in the brain. These act as molecular efflux pumps and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an abundant representative. Vulnerability to PD appears codetermined by the genotype for the P-gp gene. We hypothesized that PD patients have reduced P-gp function in the blood-brain barrier. We used positron emission tomography to measure brain uptake of [(11)C]-verapamil, which is normally extruded from the brain by P-gp. Here, we show significantly elevated uptake of [(11)C]-verapamil (18%) in the midbrain of PD patients relative to controls. This is the first evidence supporting a dysfunctional blood-brain barrier as a causative mechanism in PD."
"The dominantly inherited spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive gait ataxia, upper limb incoordination, and dysarthria. We studied a six-generation kindred of Norwegian ancestry with pure cerebellar ataxia inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. All affected family members had a slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia, with an age of onset range from 26 to 60 years. Brain magnetic resonance imaging study of 11 affected patients showed that atrophy was confined to the cerebellum. After excluding all the known SCAs using linkage analysis or direct mutation screen, we conducted a genomewide genetic linkage scan. With the aid of a novel linkage analysis strategy, we found linkage between the disease locus and marker D19S591 and D19S1034. Subsequent genetic and clinical analysis identified a critical region of 15.55cM interval on chromosome 19p13.3, flanked by markers D19S886 and D19S894, and have established a new genetic locus designated SCA26. The SCA26 locus is adjacent to the genes for Cayman ataxia and SCA6. The region consists of 3.3 million base pairs (Mb) of DNA sequences with approximately 100 known and predicted genes. Identification of the responsible gene for SCA26 ataxia will provide further insight into mechanisms of neurodegeneration."
"Patients are understandably anxious if seizures occur immediately after temporal lobectomy. Such ""neighborhood"" seizures are commonly regarded as irrelevant to seizure outcome and discounted in outcome measurement. We conducted an in-depth examination of early postoperative seizures (&lt;28 days) and outcome. The risk of recurrence at one postoperative year was calculated using Poisson regression, and statistical adjustments were made for preoperative pathology. Of 321 patients, 69 (22%) experienced early postoperative seizures. These early seizures were associated with subsequent seizure recurrence (rate ratio [RR] 5.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1-8.4). Among patients with early seizures, the only significant factor was the presence of seizure precipitants, which was associated with a lower recurrence risk. However, when compared with patients with no early seizures, those with precipitants to early seizures had a higher risk of recurrence (RR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.8-5.2). The risk was higher again for patients without precipitants to early seizures (RR, 7.6; 95% CI, 5.0-11.5). Early seizures and other seizure recurrences in the first postoperative year did not differ in their effect on subsequent outcome (X(2) [3] = 3.4, p = 0.33). We conclude that early postoperative seizures are associated with subsequent seizure recurrence. These findings have implications for patient counseling and the measurement of outcome."
"Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by the loss of normal muscle atonia during REM sleep, leading to an increase of phasic muscle activity and complex motor behaviors during the night. There is some evidence that RBD patients have more of slow-wave sleep (SWS) than healthy elderly subjects. No study has looked at quantitative electroencephalogram analysis during non-REM sleep in either primary or secondary RBD. The aim of this study was to assess the increase of SWS and to analyze different electroencephalographic frequency ranges during non-REM sleep in 28 idiopathic RBD patients compared with 28 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Idiopathic RBD patients spent more time in SWS (men: 1.4%; women: 5.9%) than control subjects (men: 0.4%; women: 0.6%; p = 0.004). Spectral analyses demonstrated that idiopathic RBD patients had increased all-night delta power in comparison with control subjects (p = 002). This study shows an increase of SWS and power in the delta band during non-REM sleep in idiopathic RBD patients compared with control subjects. Results are discussed about the possible nigrostriatal dopaminergic impairment in RBD patients and the association between RBD and neurodegenerative disorders."
"We have shown previously that intraparenchymal infusion of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) continuously into the posterior putamen in five Parkinson's disease patients is safe and may represent a new treatment option. Here, we report a continuation of this phase I study. After 2 years of continual GDNF infusion, there were no serious clinical side effects and no significant detrimental effects on cognition. Patients showed a 57% and 63% improvement in their off-medication motor and activities of daily living subscores of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, respectively, and health-related quality-of-life measures (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 and Short Form-36) showed general improvement over time."
"Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type IIC (HMSN IIC) is an autosomal dominant axonal neuropathy. The cardinal features include distal muscle wasting and weakness, vocal cord paralysis, and mild sensory impairment. Recently, HMSN IIC locus was mapped to chromosome 12q23-24. Two families affected by HMSN IIC were identified and evaluated for linkage to this region. Segregation analysis in both families was consistent with linkage to chromosome 12q23-24. Combined analysis generated a multipoint LOD score of 2.1 at marker D12S1583 and refined the HMSN IIC gene interval to The clinical and molecular findings are discussed."
"Myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) is a morphologically distinct disorder in which disintegration of the Z-disk and then of the myofibrils is followed by abnormal accumulation of multiple proteins. Mutations in desmin, alphaB-crystallin, and myotilin, all Z-disk-related proteins, cause MFM in the minority of cases. ZASP (a Z-band alternatively spliced PDZ motif-containing protein) is another Z-disk-associated protein, and targeted deletion of ZASP in mouse causes skeletal and cardiac myopathy. We therefore searched for mutations in ZASP in 54 MFM patients and detected 3 heterozygous missense mutations in 11. Their age at onset was 44 to 73 years. Dominant inheritance was apparent in seven patients, cardiac involvement in three, and signs of peripheral neuropathy in five. Most patients had proximal and distal weakness, but in six, the weakness was greater distally than proximally. Ten carried either of two mutations in exon 6 (A147T and A165V) at or within a motif important in linking ZASP to the Z-disk; one carried a missense mutation in exon 9 (R268C). We conclude that (1) mutations in ZASP cause stereotyped MFM pathology; (2) cardiomyopathy, distal more than proximal weakness, and neuropathy are in the spectrum of zaspopathy; and (3) mutations in ZASP define a novel form of autosomal dominant muscular dystrophy in humans."
"Antiepileptic drugs, particularly cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, are associated with disorders of bone metabolism. We studied premenopausal women with epilepsy receiving antiepileptic drug monotherapy (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproate, and lamotrigine). Subjects completed exercise and nutrition questionnaires and bone mineral density studies. Serum was analyzed for indices of bone metabolism including calcium, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, insulin growth factor I, insulin binding protein III, and bone formation markers, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin. Urine was analyzed for cross-linked N-telopeptide of type I collagen, a bone resorption marker. Calcium concentrations were significantly less in subjects receiving carbamazepine, phenytoin, and valproate than in those receiving lamotrigine (p = 0.008). Insulin growth factor-I was significantly reduced in subjects receiving phenytoin compared with those receiving lamotrigine (p = 0.017). Subjects receiving phenytoin had significantly greater levels of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (p = 0.007). Our results demonstrate that phenytoin is associated with changes in bone metabolism and increased bone turnover. The lower calcium concentrations in subjects taking carbamazepine or valproate compared with those taking other antiepileptic drugs suggest that these antiepileptic drugs may have long-term effects. Subjects receiving lamotrigine had no significant reductions in calcium or increases in markers of bone turnover, suggesting this agent is less likely to have long-term adverse effects on bone."
"The causative pathomechanism of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is not clearly understood. Using microarray technology combined with laser-captured microdissection, gene expression profiles of degenerating spinal motor neurons isolated from autopsied patients with sporadic ALS were examined. Gene expression was quantitatively assessed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. Spinal motor neurons showed a distinct gene expression profile from the whole spinal ventral horn. Three percent of genes examined were downregulated, and 1% were upregulated in motor neurons. Downregulated genes included those associated with cytoskeleton/axonal transport, transcription, and cell surface antigens/receptors, such as dynactin, microtubule-associated proteins, and early growth response 3 (EGR3). In contrast, cell death-associated genes were mostly upregulated. Promoters for cell death pathway, death receptor 5, cyclins A1 and C, and caspases-1, -3, and -9, were upregulated, whereas cell death inhibitors, acetyl-CoA transporter, and NF-kappaB were also upregulated. Moreover, neuroprotective neurotrophic factors such as ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor were upregulated. Inflammation-related genes, such as those belonging to the cytokine family, were not, however, significantly upregulated in either motor neurons or ventral horns. The motor neuron-specific gene expression profile in sporadic ALS can provide direct information on the genes leading to neurodegeneration and neuronal death and are helpful for developing new therapeutic strategies."
"Interictal brain energy metabolism and glutamate-glutamine cycling are impaired in epilepsy and may contribute to seizure generation. We used the zero-flow microdialysis method to measure the extracellular levels of glutamate, glutamine, and the major energy substrates glucose and lactate in the epileptogenic and the nonepileptogenic cortex and hippocampus of 38 awake epileptic patients during the interictal period. Depth electrodes attached to microdialysis probes were used to identify the epileptogenic and the nonepileptogenic sites. The epileptogenic hippocampus had surprisingly high basal glutamate levels, low glutamine/glutamate ratio, high lactate levels, and indication for poor glucose utilization. The epileptogenic cortex had only marginally increased glutamate levels. We propose that interictal energetic deficiency in the epileptogenic hippocampus could contribute to impaired glutamate reuptake and glutamate-glutamine cycling, resulting in persistently increased extracellular glutamate, glial and neuronal toxicity, increased lactate production together with poor lactate and glucose utilization, and ultimately worsening energy metabolism. Our data suggest that a different neurometabolic process underlies the neocortical epilepsies."
"The purpose of this study was to describe unusual variants of Alexander's disease. We studied 10 patients who did not meet previously established magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) criteria for Alexander's disease, but for whom this diagnosis was considered because of Rosenthal fibers at histological examination or presence of some MRI features suggestive of Alexander's disease. Sequence analysis of the GFAP gene was performed. In eight patients, MRI results showed predominantly posterior fossa lesions, especially multiple tumor-like brainstem lesions. One patient had asymmetrical frontal white matter abnormalities and basal ganglia abnormalities. One patient (Patient 10) developed degeneration of the frontal white matter. In nine patients, a mutation was found that was concluded to be pathogenic, because the mutation was de novo (five patients), a known mutation was found (two patients), or assembly of the glial fibrillary acidic protein was abnormal in cultured cells (two patients). In Patient 10, a DNA variation was found that was also present in the patient's clinically unaffected father and was concluded to be a polymorphism. In conclusion, DNA diagnostics is warranted in patients who display MRI features suggestive of Alexander's disease, even if they do not meet the full set of previously established MRI criteria."
"In generalized myasthenia gravis (MG) patients without detectable acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies (SNMG), the thymus is often reported as ""normally involuted."" We analyzed thymic compartments in 67 patients with generalized MG, with AChR antibodies (AChR+, n = 23), with muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) antibodies (MuSK+, n = 14) or with neither (MuSK-, n = 30), and in 11 non-MG controls. Four of 14 MuSK+ thymi had rare small germinal centers, but overall they were not different from age-matched controls. However, approximately 75% MuSK- samples showed lymph node-type infiltrates similar to those in AChR+ patients, but with fewer germinal centers. These variations may explain some apparent differences in responses to thymectomy in SNMG."
"To determine whether the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) and alpha-synuclein (SNCA) genes interact to confer Parkinson's disease (PD) susceptibility, we conducted a study of 557 case-control pairs. There was an increased risk of PD for persons with either SNCA 261/261 or MAPT H1/H1 genotypes as compared with persons with neither (odds ratio, 1.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-2.86; p = 0.0003). However, the combined effect of the two genotypes was the same as for either of the genotypes alone (separate and equal). These findings are consistent with in vitro experiments that revealed tau-mediated fibrillization of alpha-synuclein protein at low concentrations (dose threshold effect)."
"We report a case of cerebral fat embolism which occurred in a 33-year-old man after a diaphyseal femoral fracture without cranial traumatism. The initial examination showed an incomplete picture of coma with tetrapyramidal syndrome and cutaneomucous purpura. There was no respiratory damage. We present a magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis of the cerebral lesions observed in the initial phase of the embolism, as well as follow-up, which has strengthened the clinical and imaging features for the diagnosis."
"Converging evidence points to a pivotal role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in neuronal protection and a lack of its activity in neurodegenerative disorders. To investigate this possible association, we screened the VEGF gene promoter for various well-known single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a series of 249 consecutively recruited Italian patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Genetic analysis indicated different distributions of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the AD population compared with healthy control subjects. In particular, the frequencies of -2578A/A and -1198C/T genotypes were significantly greater in AD patients than in control subjects (23.7 vs 14.7% and 2.8 vs 0%, respectively). The -2578A/A genotype was associated with an increased risk for disease, independently of apolipoprotein E genotype. The risk was significantly increased with respect to various VEGF genotype combinations. In contrast, no difference in serum VEGF levels was detected comparing 96 patients and 49 control subjects. These findings suggest that polymorphisms within the promoter region of the VEGF gene confer greater risk for AD, probably by reducing its neuroprotective effect, and confirm the biological role of VEGF in neurodegenerative processes."
"During the last few years several loci have been linked to Mendelian forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, 5 causative genes of 10 identified loci are known, and they have provided enormous insight into the molecular pathways involved in this common neurodegenerative disorder. One of the recently identified loci, PARK8, causes autosomal dominant PD with, apparently, various degrees of abnormal deposition of alpha-synuclein or tau in the neuronal cells in the pedigrees currently reported. We genetically characterized four Basque families and found evidence for linkage of autosomal dominant PD to the PARK8 locus, with a maximum 2-point logarithm of odds score of 3.21 (theta = 0.00) for marker D12S345. The clinical features of these families are those of typical PD, including good response to levodopa therapy, rigidity, and akinesia, and a mean age of 55 years at disease onset."
"Genetic diseases affecting the brain typically have widespread lesions that require global correction. Lysosomal storage diseases are good candidates for central nervous system gene therapy, because active enzyme from genetically corrected cells can be secreted and taken up by surrounding diseased cells, and only small amounts of enzyme (&lt;5% of normal) are required to reverse storage lesions. Injection of gene transfer vectors into multiple sites in the mouse brain has been shown to mediate widespread reversal of storage lesions in several disease models. To study a brain closer in size to the human brain, we evaluated the extent of storage correction mediated by a limited number of adeno-associated virus vector injections in the cat model of human alpha-mannosidosis. The treated cats showed remarkable improvements in clinical neurological signs and in brain myelination assessed by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging. Postmortem examination showed that storage lesions were greatly reduced throughout the brain, even though gene transfer was limited to the areas surrounding the injection tracks. The data demonstrate that widespread improvement of neuropathology in a large mammalian brain can be achieved using multiple injection sites during one operation and suggest that this could be an effective treatment for the central nervous system component of human lysosomal enzyme deficiencies."
"We report early-onset parkinsonism and dementia of 18 years' duration in a 52-year-old man whose grandfather and father had suffered from a similar neurological disease. In this patient, we found neuronal loss in various brain regions including the substantia nigra and cerebral cortex, Lewy bodies, cotton wool plaques, corticospinal tract degeneration, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and a novel three-base pair deletion in exon 12 of the presenilin-1 (PSEN1) gene. We considered that the mutant PSEN1 might play an important role in the pathogenetic process of both aggregation of alpha-synuclein into Lewy bodies and deposition of beta-amyloid into cotton wool plaques."
"Patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and intractable pain showed a shrinkage of cortical maps on primary (SI) and secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) contralateral to the affected limb. This was paralleled by an impairment of the two-point discrimination thresholds. Behavioral treatment over 1 to 6 months consisting of graded sensorimotor retuning led to a persistent decrease in pain intensity, which was accompanied by a restoration of the impaired tactile discrimination and regaining of cortical map size in contralateral SI and SII. This suggests that the reversal of tactile impairment and cortical reorganization in CRPS is associated with a decrease in pain."
"This study documents the effects of puffer-fish poisoning on peripheral nerve. Excitability measurements investigated membrane properties of sensory and motor axons in four patients. The median nerve was stimulated at the wrist, with compound muscle potentials recorded from abductor pollicis brevis and compound sensory potentials from digit 2. Stimulus-responses, strength-duration time constant (tau(SD)), threshold electrotonus, and current-threshold relations were recorded. The urine of each patient tested positive for tetrodotoxin. Compared with controls, axons were of higher threshold, compound muscle action potentials and compound sensory nerve action potentials were reduced in amplitude, latency was prolonged, and tau(SD) was reduced. In recovery cycles, refractoriness, superexcitability, and late subexcitability were decreased. Threshold electrotonus of motor axons exhibited distinctive abnormalities with less threshold decline than normal on depolarization and greater threshold increase on hyperpolarization (p &lt; 0.0005 for each patient). The changes in excitability were reproduced in a mathematical model by reducing sodium (Na(+)) permeabilities by a factor of two. This study confirms that the neurotoxic effects of puffer-fish poisoning can be explained by tetrodotoxin blockade of Na(+) channels. It demonstrates the ability of noninvasive nerve excitability studies to detect Na(+) channel blockade in vivo and also the utility of mathematical modeling to aid interpretation of altered excitability properties in disease."
"We have recently identified mutations in a gene leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2), which cause autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease. Here, we describe two families with autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease caused by a LRRK2 G2019S mutation. We present here a clinical description of patients, including 6-(18)F-fluoro-L-dopa positron emission tomography and discuss the potential implications of this mutation, which alters a conserved residue in a domain required for kinase activation."
"Parkinson's disease patients benefit from deep brain stimulation (DBS) in subthalamic nucleus (STN), but the basis for this effect is still disputed. In this intraoperative microdialysis study, we found elevated cGMP extracellular concentrations in the internal segment of the globus pallidus, despite negligible changes in glutamate levels, during a clinically effective STN-DBS. This supports the view that a clinically beneficial effect of STN-DBS is paralleled by an augmentation (and not an inactivation) of the STN output onto the GPi."
"In this study, we used a monoclonal IgM antibody from a patient with a pure motor chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy, which binds specifically to the complex gangliosides GM(2), GalNAc-GD(1a), and GalNAc-GM(1b), which appear to have a common epitope of -[GalNAcbeta1-4Gal(3-2alphaNeuAc)beta1]. This was done for the following reasons: (1) to localize these gangliosides in specific cellular components of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), and (2) to describe the anti-ganglioside antibody-induced structural and functional changes in the NMJs to gain insight into the role of gangliosides in the synaptic function. Using immunofluorescence techniques, we found that these gangliosides are located only in the presynaptic component of the motor end-plates, both in nerve terminals and in Schwann cells. After 2 weeks of continued passive transfer of the IgM monoclonal antibody over the mouse levator auris longus muscle, electromyography showed an axonal or NMJ disorder. Morphology showed important nerve terminal growth and retraction changes. Using intracellular recording electrophysiology, we found neurotransmitter release alterations, including quantal content reduction and an immature expression of voltage-dependent calcium channels similar to what occurred during NMJ development and regeneration. These changes were complement independent. The results showed that these gangliosides were involved in the reciprocal Schwann cell-nerve terminal interactions, including structural stability and neurotransmission."
"Nerve injury represents a major cause of disability. In the peripheral nervous system, nerves have the capacity to regrow but within weeks after injury, it is impossible to clarify whether proper regeneration is under way or is failing. In this experimental study, we report on a novel tool to assess nerve outgrowth in vivo. After systemic application, the novel gadolinium-based magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent Gadofluorine M (Gf) selectively accumulated and persisted in nerve fibers undergoing Wallerian degeneration causing bright contrast on T1-weighted MR images. Gf enhancement on MR imaging was present already at 48 hours within the entire nerve segments undergoing Wallerian degeneration, and subsequently disappeared from proximal to distal parts in parallel to regrowth of nerve fibers. Most importantly, Gf enhancement persisted in nonregenerating, permanently transected nerves. Our novel Gf-based MR imaging methodology holds promise for clinical use to bridge the diagnostic gap between nerve injury and completed nerve regeneration, and to determine the necessity for neurolysis and engraftment if spontaneous regeneration is not successful."
"Depression associates with increased risk for dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), although it is unclear whether it represents an actual risk factor or a prodrome. To determine the relative hazard of premorbid depressive symptomatology for development of dementia and AD, we studied risk for incident dementia and AD over a 14-year period in 1,357 community-dwelling men and women participating in the 40-year prospective Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Screening for depressive symptoms, comprehensive medical and neuropsychological evaluations were prospectively collected every 2 years. Time-dependent proportional hazards of development of AD or dementia were calculated separately for men and women, with symptoms of depression detected at 2-, 4-, and 6-year intervals before onset of dementia symptoms. Vascular risk factors were analyzed as covariates. Premorbid depressive symptoms significantly increased risk for dementia, particularly AD in men but not in women. Hazard ratios were approximately two times greater than for individuals without history of depressive symptoms, an effect independent of vascular disease. We conclude that the impact of depressive symptoms on risk for dementia and AD may vary with sex. Further studies assessing separately the role of depression as a risk factor in men and women are necessary."
"Alexander disease is a progressive, usually fatal neurological disorder defined by the widespread and abundant presence in astrocytes of protein aggregates called Rosenthal fibers. The disease most often occurs in infants younger than 2 years and has been labeled a leukodystrophy because of an accompanying severe myelin deficit in the frontal lobes. Later onset forms have also been recognized based on the presence of abundant Rosenthal fibers. In these cases, clinical signs and pathology can be quite different from the infantile form, raising the question whether they share the same underlying cause. Recently, we and others have found pathogenic, de novo missense mutations in the glial fibrillary acidic protein gene in most infantile patients examined and in a few later onset patients. To obtain further information about the role of glial fibrillary acidic protein mutations in Alexander disease, we analyzed 41 new patients and another 3 previously described clinically, including 18 later onset patients. Our results show that dominant missense glial fibrillary acidic protein mutations account for nearly all forms of this disorder. They also significantly expand the catalog of responsible mutations, verify the value of magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis, indicate an unexpected male predominance for the juvenile form, and provide insights into phenotype-genotype relations."
"Mutations in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene on chromosome 9p13-p12 recently have been shown to cause autosomal dominant inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia. Here, we report the central nervous system autopsy findings in a 55-year-old German patient with inclusion body myopathy and frontotemporal dementia who harbors a heterozygous R155C missense mutation residing in the N-terminal CDC48 domain of VCP, which is involved in ubiquitin binding. We demonstrate that mutant VCP causes a novel type of frontotemporal dementia characterized by neuronal nuclear inclusions containing ubiquitin and VCP."
"Senataxin recently was identified as the mutated gene in ataxia-oculomotor apraxia 2, which is characterized by ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and increased alpha-fetoprotein levels. In this study, we evaluated 24 ataxic patients from 10 French-Canadian families. All cases have a homogeneous phenotype consisting of a progressive ataxia appearing between 2 and 20 (mean age, 14.8) years of age with associated dysarthria, saccadic ocular pursuit, distal amyotrophy, sensory and motor neuropathy, and increased alpha-fetoprotein levels but absence of oculomotor apraxia. Linkage disequilibrium was observed with markers in the ataxia-oculomotor apraxia 2 locus on chromosome 9q34. We have identified four mutations in senataxin in the French-Canadian population including two novel missense mutations: the 5927T--&gt;G mutation changes the leucine encoded by codon 1976 to an arginine in the helicase domain (L1976R), and the 193G--&gt;A mutation changes a glutamic acid encoded by codon 65 into a lysine in the N-terminal domain of the protein (E65K). The common L1976R mutation is shared by 17 of 20 (85%) carrier chromosomes. The study of this large French-Canadian cohort better defines the phenotype of this ataxia and presents two novel mutations in senataxin including the more common founder mutation in the French-Canadian population."
"Recently, two missense mutations (N88S, S90L) in the Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy gene have been identified in autosomal dominant distal hereditary motor neuropathy and Silver syndrome. We report the phenotypic consequences of the N88S mutation in 90 patients of 1 large Austrian family and two unrelated German families. Variation in the clinical and electrophysiological phenotype enabled us to distinguish six subtypes. In 4.4%, the disorder was not penetrant. Twenty percent of the patients were subclinically affected; some of these patients could only be detected by pathological nerve conduction studies. A distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V phenotype characterized by predominant hand muscle involvement was found in 31.1%, whereas 14.5% showed typical Silver syndrome with amyotrophy of the small hand muscles and spasticity of the lower extremities. Moreover, the phenotype present in 20% was compatible with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. In 10%, the clinical diagnosis of pure or complicated hereditary spastic paraparesis was made. Electrophysiological studies showed an axonal neuropathy but also chronodispersion of compound motor action potentials and conduction blocks. Sensory nerve conduction studies were rarely pathological. Our study indicates that the dominant N88S mutation in the Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy gene 2 leads to a broad spectrum of motor neuron disorders."
"Pure hereditary spastic paraplegias are characterized by isolated and progressive spasticity in the lower limbs. We mapped the spastic paraplegia 28 (SPG28) locus to chromosome 14q21.3-q22.3 in a Moroccan family with autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia. Affected patients experienced development of progressive spastic gait during childhood and required help walking in their early 40s. Nine additional hereditary spastic paraplegia families were not linked to this locus, demonstrating further genetic heterogeneity. No mutations were found in exons of GCH1 and SPG3A, two genes from the candidate region involved in movement disorders."
"There is increasing evidence that genetic variants of mitochondrial DNA have an important role in the cause of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. We determined the mitochondrial DNA haplogroup of 455 Parkinson's disease cases, 185 Alzheimer's disease cases, and 447 healthy English control subjects. The UKJT haplogroup cluster was associated with a 22% reduction in population-attributable risk for Parkinson's disease. There was no association between individual haplogroups or the UKJT cluster and Alzheimer's disease, confirming that the association with Parkinson's disease was disease specific and not a general effect seen in all neurodegenerative diseases."
Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is an inherited disorder with a chronic progressive disease course and additional episodes of rapid neurological deterioration. These episodes typically are provoked by febrile infections or minor head trauma. We report on two patients who experienced an episode of rapid neurological deterioration after a fright.
"Methylation is an important aspect of many fundamental biological processes including creatine biosynthesis. We studied five patients with an inborn error of cobalamin metabolism to characterize the relation between homocysteine and creatine metabolism. Plasma guanidinoacetate concentrations were increased, 14.9 +/- 4.8 micromol/L (p &lt; 0.0001), whereas plasma creatine concentrations were in the low reference range, 43.8 +/- 20.7 micromol/L (p = not significant). Individuals with combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria have a functional impairment of the creatine synthetic pathway probably secondary to a relative depletion of labile methyl groups. The neurotoxic effects of guanidinoacetate may be partly responsible for the observed neurological phenotype."
"Nogo, a protein inhibiting axonal regeneration, exhibits a characteristic isoform-specific pattern of expression in skeletal muscle of transgenic mice and patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Here, the increased levels of Nogo-A or Nogo-B in muscle biopsies of 15 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients significantly correlated with the severity of clinical disability and with the degree of muscle fiber atrophy. Nogo-A immunoreactivity was observed selectively in atrophic slow-twitch type I fibers. These results suggest that Nogo expression in muscle is a marker of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis severity."
"We report here a family in which each of nine children has inherited giant SCA8 CTG expansions from a homozygous mother who has two moderately large SCA8 CTG alleles. In contrast, three homozygous male individuals and a case of coexistence of two expansions of the FRDA gene and one of SCA8, all of them with moderately large alleles, have transmitted their respective SCA8 expanded alleles with minor changes, as usually occurs in heterozygous male transmissions."
"Jouberts syndrome-related disorders are a group of recessively inherited conditions showing cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and the molar tooth sign of the midbrain-hindbrain junction. Recent analyses have suggested at least three loci, JBTS1 (9q34.3), -2 (11p11.2-q12.3), and -3 (6q23), but the phenotypic spectrum associated with each locus has not been delineated. In addition, deletions of the NPHP1 gene, usually responsible for isolated juvenile nephronophthisis, are occasionally encountered among Jouberts syndrome-related disorder patients. Here, we describe four novel families showing evidence of linkage to two of these loci, provide a 3.6Mb refinement of the JBTS2 locus, and perform a detailed comparison of all linked families identified so far, to define the clinical and radiographical hallmarks for each genetic condition. We find that JBTS1 and -3 primarily show features restricted to the central nervous system, with JBTS1 showing largely pure cerebellar and midbrain-hindbrain junction involvement, and JBTS3 displaying cerebellar, midbrain-hindbrain junction, and cerebral cortical features, most notably polymicrogyria. Conversely, JBTS2 is associated with multiorgan involvement of kidney, retina, and liver, in addition to the central nervous system features, and results in extreme phenotypic variability. This provides a useful framework for genetic testing strategies and prediction of which patients are most likely to experience development of systemic complications."
"Two studies found that stroke patients with intracranial arterial dolichoectasia (IADE) had lacunar infarction more often than the control subjects. The relation between IADE and other manifestations of small-vessel disease (multilacunar state, leukoaraiosis, and &#xe9;tat cribl&#xe9;) was not investigated. The magnetic resonance images of 510 patients with brain infarction in the Etude du Profil Genetique de l'Infarctus Cerebral (GENIC) study were evaluated for the diagnosis of multilacunar infarction (&gt;1 lacunar infarct), leukoaraiosis (assessed in periventricular and subcortical regions according to Scheltens and colleagues' scale, with severe leukoaraiosis defined as a score &gt; 8), &#xe9;tat cribl&#xe9; (using a semiquantitative score ranging from 0-8, with severe EC &gt; 4), and IADE (using the consensus method). By comparison with stroke patients without IADE (n = 447), IADE(+) stroke patients (n = 63) had significantly more frequent multilacunar state (51 vs 33%), severe leukoaraiosis (34 vs 19%), and severe &#xe9;tat cribl&#xe9; (32 vs 12%). After adjustment for potential confounding factors, the odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for the presence of IADE were 2.05 (1.08-3.87) for multilacunar state, 2.40 (1.11-5.20) for severe leukoaraiosis, and 3.60 (1.43-9.08) for severe &#xe9;tat cribl&#xe9;. The factors significantly associated with &#xe9;tat cribl&#xe9; were older age and a familial history of stroke. IADE in stroke patients was independently associated with parenchymal manifestations of small-vessel disease. These conditions may have in common underlying pathophysiological processes."
"In dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), the issue of whether non-CAG dependent factors contribute to onset age remains unsettled. Data on SCA genotype, onset age, normal/expanded CAG repeat length, sex of the patient and transmitting parent, and family details were available from 802 patients. Based on the model [log(10) (age at onset) = k - b CAG(exp) + epsilon], we examined changes in adjusted R(2) and residual standard error following incorporation of the other factors in this model. The expanded repeat explained 44.3 to 74.9% of onset age variance, although this was less than 50% in SCA3 and SCA6, implicating a large effect of non-CAG factors. The relation between onset age and CAG repeat was similar for SCA1, 3, 6, and 7, but different for SCA2, pointing to different polyglutamine effects in SCA2. For SCA2 and SCA3, 17.1 and 45.5% of onset age variance, respectively, were explained by currently (unidentified) familial factors. We found a significant contribution of the nonexpanded allele in SCA1 and SCA6. Besides polyglutamine motif (determined by the expanded CAG repeat length), we identified the following age at onset modifiers: protein context in SCA2; familial factors in SCA2 and SCA3; and the nonexpanded CAG repeat in SCA1 and SCA6."
"The objective of this article is to study the accuracy of antemortem clinical diagnoses of frontotemporal lobar degenerations (FTLDs). From brain autopsies performed on subjects enrolled in the Mayo Alzheimer Center between 1991 and 2003, cases with neuropathological diagnoses of FTLD were identified. Neuropathological diagnoses of FTLDs were based on consensus criteria for FTLD. The initial clinical histories, neuropsychological test results, brain imaging studies, and initial clinical diagnoses were reviewed. There were 34 pathological FTLD cases among 433 subjects who underwent autopsy; 29 of these 34 cases were diagnosed as FTLD antemortem based on the sum of clinical, neuropsychological, and imaging features (sensitivity, 85%). The specificity was 99%. Among the 34 cases with pathological FTLD, 27 (79%) had clinical histories diagnostic of an FTLD syndrome, 20 (62%) had neuropsychological profiles consistent with FTLD, 17 (50%) had magnetic resonance scans consistent with FTLD, and 7 of 8 who had functional imaging studies had ones consistent with FTLD. In those with incorrect antemortem diagnoses, three were thought to have Alzheimer's disease, one was considered hard to classify, and one was diagnosed with vascular dementia. The antemortem consensus diagnosis of FTLD was moderately sensitive and very specific. With experienced clinicians and awareness of the unique manifestations of FTLD, accurate antemortem diagnosis was feasible."
"The entorhinal cortex lies in the mediotemporal lobe and has major functional, structural, and clinical significance. The entorhinal cortex has a unique cytoarchitecture with large stellate neurons in layer II that form clusters. The entorhinal cortex receives vast sensory association input, and its major output arises from the layer II and III neurons that form the perforant pathway. Clinically, the neurons in layer II are affected with neurofibrillary tangles, one of the two pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. We describe detection of the entorhinal layer II islands using magnetic resonance imaging. We scanned human autopsied temporal lobe blocks in a 7T human scanner using a solenoid coil. In 70 and 100 microm isotropic data, the entorhinal islands were clearly visible throughout the anterior-posterior extent of entorhinal cortex. Layer II islands were prominent in both the magnetic resonance imaging and corresponding histological sections, showing similar size and shape in two types of data. Area borders and island location based on cytoarchitectural features in the mediotemporal lobe were robustly detected using the magnetic resonance images. Our ex vivo results could break ground for high-resolution in vivo scanning that could ultimately benefit early diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative disease."
"Volume expansion associated with brain infarction occurs in perfusion-diffusion mismatch of magnetic resonance imaging. We aimed at elucidating the metabolic impairment of this phenomenon with (15)O positron emission tomography and perfusion and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Eleven patients with acute unilateral embolic occlusion of the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery were studied within 6 hours of onset. Regional cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) were compared with those in the contralateral cerebral hemisphere. The relative apparent diffusion coefficient of water was estimated as a marker of cytotoxic edema. Relative cerebral blood flow and relative CMRO(2) in an evolving infarct (normal diffusion initially, but abnormal on day 3) were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) less than those in the periinfarct area (normal diffusion initially and on day 3). The relative apparent diffusion coefficient between the evolving infarct and periinfarct showed no significant difference. These findings indicated that the initial 3-day volume expansion of an embolic brain infarction was associated with disturbed CMRD(2) but not with cytotoxic edema as early as 6 hours after onset. The ""metabolic penumbra"" defined as normal water diffusion with depressed CMRO(2) is a target to reduce the volume expansion of brain infarction."
"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms and by a progressive loss among other, of dopaminergic receptors in striatum, cortex, and hypothalamus. Central dopaminergic activity has been implicated in the regulation of sex hormones. Several features of testosterone deficiency, such as reduced muscle mass, depressive mood, and cognitive impairment, are often present in HD patients, but data on their testosterone levels are lacking. We assessed plasma levels of testosterone, LH, and FSH in 42 male patients with HD, confirmed by molecular genetic analysis, and searched for differences from age-matched healthy male subjects and for relations to CAG repeat number, age, age range, 26 to 76 (mean, 50.7 +/- 12.3) years; duration of illness range, 1 to 23 (mean, 6.7 +/- 6.3) years; and CAG repeat numbers from 40 to 65 (45.1 +/- 3.8). Disease symptomatology was assessed using the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale. Testosterone and LH levels of the patients were significantly lower compared to the levels of 44 age-matched (mean age, 48.9 +/- 13.0, range, 26-76 years) healthy men. Severity of illness was negatively related to plasma testosterone levels. Further, low testosterone levels were associated with dementia but not with depression or psychotic features. Clinical studies with selected HD patients are needed to evaluate possible beneficial effects of androgen substitution therapy on cognitive functions, depression, muscle mass and strength, general well-being, and, eventually, neuroprotective effects."
"Human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system. Immune activation in the host, which results from high levels of persistent antigenic stimulation and from transactivation of host immunoregulatory genes by HTLV-I, appears important in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP. In a single-center, open-label trial, 12 patients with HAM/TSP were treated with doses of interferon-beta1a of up to 60mug twice weekly, based on its antiviral and immunomodulatory effects. Primary end points were immunological and virological measures that are potential biomarkers for HAM/TSP. Interferon-beta1a therapy reduced the HTLV-I tax messenger RNA load and the frequency of potentially pathogenic HTLV-I-specific CD8(+) cells. The HTLV-I proviral DNA load remained unchanged. Spontaneous lymphoproliferation, a marker of T-cell activation in HAM/TSP, also was reduced. Some measures of motor function were improved, and no significant clinical progression occurred during therapy. These results indicate that interferon-beta1a may beneficially affect the immune mechanisms central to the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP."
"A major limitation in thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke is the restricted time window for safe and effective therapy. Any method that can extend the reperfusion time window would be important. In this study, we show that normobaric hyperoxia extends the time window for effective reperfusion from 1 to 3 hours in rats subjected to focal cerebral ischemia. Normobaric hyperoxia did not increase cellular markers of superoxide generation or brain levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9. Normobaric hyperoxia may be a clinically feasible adjunct method for significantly increasing the time window for effective thrombolytic therapy in acute ischemic stroke."
"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) typically affects the CNS white matter of the central nervous system. We present an human immunodeficiency virus-infected patient with polyomavirus JC infection restricted to granule cell neurons of the cerebellum and with corresponding neurological symptomatology. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated cerebellar atrophy without white matter lesions and stereotactic biopsy showed selective infection of the cerebellar granular cell layer, with preservation of Purkinje cells and absence of classic progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy histopathology in underlying white matter. Evolution over 8 years was marked by symptomatic improvement corresponding to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), with modest increase in CD4(+) T-cell counts. We propose to call this novel syndrome JCV granule cell neuronopathy (JCV GCN)."
"Although acute intermittent porphyria presents with dramatic neurological findings, the diagnosis is difficult. An 18-year-old woman had a clinical picture of porphyric encephalopathy. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated multiple large contrast-enhancing subcortical white matter lesions, which regressed with glucose and hematin infusions. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging was normal, and MR spectroscopy excluded acute demyelination or tissue necrosis. MR findings of acute intermittent porphyria can differ from those in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome by virtue of intense contrast enhancement. Because diffusion-weighted MR imaging and spectroscopy were normal, the lesions are likely caused by reversible vasogenic edema and transient breakdown of the blood-brain barrier."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex multifactorial disease in which many genetic and environmental factors are involved. We performed an association study using 376 AD patients and 376 control subjects. We studied 35 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 35 genes that were significantly downregulated or upregulated only in the AD hippocampus compared with control and found that 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with AD. Our data indicated that single nucleotide polymorphisms could highly reflect differences in gene expression. Furthermore, an intronic polymorphism (+9943T/C) in POU2F1 was most significantly associated with AD (p = 0.0007). Our results suggest that POU2F1 is a candidate gene for AD."
"A 2-year-old boy presented with early-onset Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). His parents had not been diagnosed previously with CMT, but on careful examination they showed clinical signs of CMT and reduced nerve conduction velocities. Genetic analysis identified the boy as a heterozygote for both a peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) duplication and a mutation in the lipopolysaccharide-induced-tumour-necrosis-factor-alpha-factor (LITAF) gene, whereas each parent only had one mutated CMT gene. This suggests that LITAF mutations can severely affect the CMT phenotype caused by a PMP22 duplication."
