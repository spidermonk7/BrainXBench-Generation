Abstract
"alpha-Synuclein is considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of both the rare familial and the common sporadic forms of Parkinson's disease. Previous reports primarily have tested the association of alpha-synuclein promoter polymorphisms with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, but results are controversial. We first characterized the linkage disequilibrium structure of the alpha-synuclein gene region with a dense set of 56 genetic markers and subsequently performed two independent case-control association analyses using tagging markers. We could distinguish two large linkage disequilibrium blocks spanning the alpha-synuclein gene. Several markers within the 3'-block around exons 5 and 6 showed strong association with Parkinson's disease (p = 0.00009). Effects of the associated variants might be mediated by regulatory elements in this highly conserved region or by a frequency shift in a previously described splice variant lacking exon 5. A direct association with promoter polymorphisms could not be replicated in our sample set. A second set of markers in the 5'-block of the gene were also significantly associated with Parkinson's disease, when young patients and female subjects were analyzed separately. These findings indicate locus heterogeneity for the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease in different genetic or physiological environments, related to sex and age."
"Epstein-Barr virus infection may cause severe neurological complications that are not mirrored by animal models. Here, we show that nasal inoculation of newborn BALB/c wild-type mice with MHV-68, a murine gammaherpesvirus, causes cerebral infection with inflammation in 50% of the animals. The inflammatory patterns are strikingly similar to those known from Epstein-Barr virus, including hydrocephalus, meningitis, cerebellitis, focal or diffuse encephalitis, and temporal lobe encephalitis. This offers a new powerful tool to study the virological and immunological characteristics of cerebral gammaherpesvirus infections."
"Sarcotubular myopathy (OMIM 268950) is a rare autosomal recessive myopathy first described in two Hutterite brothers from South Dakota and in two non-Hutterite brothers from Germany. We report that sarcotubular myopathy (STM) is caused by mutation in TRIM32, the gene encoding the tripartite motif-containing protein 32. TRIM32 was found to be the gene mutated in limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2H (LGMD2H [OMIM 254110]), a disorder that has been confined to the Hutterite population. The TRIM32 mutation found in the STM patients is identical to the causative mutation for LGMD2H (D487N), Haplotype analysis shows that the disease chromosomes share common ancestry."
"We used [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography to determine a discrete cerebral pattern of abnormal glucose utilization in dopa-responsive dystonia. Network analysis demonstrated that dopa-responsive dystonia is associated with a specific pattern of regional metabolic covariation, characterized by increases in the dorsal midbrain, cerebellum, and supplementary motor area, as well as reductions in motor and lateral premotor cortex and in the basal ganglia. This pattern was not expressed in mutation carriers for primary torsion dystonia. Dopa-responsive dystonia has a unique metabolic architecture that differs from other inherited forms of dystonia."
"Systemic enzyme replacement for Gaucher's disease has not prevented premature death or severe morbidity in patients with a neuronopathic phenotype, because the enzyme does not cross the blood-brain barrier. We used convection-enhanced delivery for regional distribution of glucocerebrosidase in rat and primate brains and examined its safety and feasibility for neuronopathic Gaucher's disease. Rats underwent intrastriatal infusion and were observed and then sacrificed at 14 hours, 4 days, or 6 weeks. Primates underwent serial magnetic resonance imaging during enzyme perfusion of the right frontal lobe or brainstem, were observed and then sacrificed after infusion completion. Animals underwent histologic and enzymatic tissue analyses. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed perfusion of the primate right frontal lobe or pons with infusate. Enzyme activity was substantially and significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased in cortex and white matter of the infused frontal lobe and pons compared to control. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated intraneuronal glucocerebrosidase. There was no toxicity. Convection-enhanced delivery can be used to safely perfuse large regions of the brain and brainstem with therapeutic levels of glucocerebrosidase. Patients with neuronopathic Gaucher's disease and similar central nervous system disorders may benefit from this treatment."
"The ability to distinguish adaptive cortical reorganization may help to target future therapeutic strategies after neurological insult. We investigated cortical plasticity by prospectively applying visual functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and optic nerve MRI to 20 patients with acute optic neuritis at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. We performed three types of correlation analyses to investigate the relationships between fMRI activity, clinical function, and optic nerve structure. The first analysis directly correlated the fMRI response to clinical function or optic nerve structure and found dynamic relations especially within the first 3 months. The second analysis used a novel technique that modeled the fMRI response and optic nerve structure together with clinical function, to determine the contribution fMRI made to clinical function after accounting for structural factors. Significant effects were found at baseline only, within the right peristriate cortex, and bilaterally in the lateral occipital complexes, which are normally involved in higher order visual processing. The third analysis investigated the relation between the modeled visual recovery rate and fMRI response but found no significant effects. The key findings of this study are from the second analysis and suggest a genuine adaptive role for cortical reorganization within extrastriate visual areas early after optic neuritis."
"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a disorder of unknown pathogenesis. Familial clusters of PSP have been reported related to mutations of protein tau. We report the linkage of a large Spanish family with typical autosomal dominant PSP to a new locus in chromosome 1. Four members of this family had typical PSP, confirmed by neuropathology in one case. At least five ancestors had similar disease. Other members of the family have incomplete phenotypes. The power of the linkage analysis was increased by detecting presymptomatic individuals with 18F-fluoro-dopa and 18F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography. We screened the human genome with 340 polymorphic markers and we enriched the areas of interest with additional markers. The disease status was defined according to the clinical and positron emission tomography data. We excluded linkage to the tau gene in chromosome 17. PSP was linked, in this family, to one area of 3.4 cM in chromosome 1q31.1, with a maximal multipoint &lt; OD score of +3.53. This area contains at least three genes, whose relevance in PSP is unknown. We expect to further define the gene responsible for PSP, which could help to understand the pathogenesis of this disease and to design effective treatment."
"To test the proposed neuroprotective activity of whole ginseng extract and its components, we used 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), an inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, to produce neurodegeneration. Treatment with 3-nitropropionic acid (90 mg/kg) over a 5-day period resulted in severe impairment of movement and loss of neurons in the striatum. Pretreatment with a preparation from the whole root of American ginseng had no protective effects. Pretreatment with a preparation of ground leaves and stems, which contains greater levels of ginsenosides than ground root, improved the behavioral score and reduced the volume of the striatal lesion. A partial purification of American ginseng was performed to concentrate the putative protective components: Rb1, Rb3, and Rd (termed Rb extract). Pretreatment with the Rb extract significantly reduced the 3-nitropropionic acid-induced motor impairment and cell loss in the striatum, and it completely prevented any mortality. Significant effects on motor function, mortality, and the striatal lesion volume also were measured in animals pretreated with the individual ginsenosides, Rb1, Rb3, or Rd. The results demonstrate that some of the ginsenosides have neuroprotective activity, and that a partial purification of whole ginseng to concentrate the neuroprotective components may have utility as a neuroprotective agent."
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease of the neuromuscular system resulting in paralysis and ultimately death. Currently, no effective therapy is prescribed for patients; however, several therapeutic strategies are showing promise. Either exercise or treatment with adeno-associated virus/insulin-like growth factor-1 alone has therapeutic benefits in an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis transgenic mouse model. We show here that activity duration affects the therapeutic benefit associated with exercise, with 6- and 12-hour exposure to a running wheel providing significant motor function benefits and increased survival. Remarkably, a combination of insulin-like growth factor-1 gene delivery and exercise has profound effects on survival and function, indicative of synergistic effects with exercise and insulin-like growth factor-1. Our results indicate that a drug treatment in combination with appropriate exercise may provide the most promising therapy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis to date."
"Freezing of gait (FOG) is a disabling phenomenon common in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). The cause of FOG is unclear. The objective of this study was to explore a novel hypothesis stating that FOG is related to asymmetric motor performance. We compared PD patients that experience FOG episodes (PD+FOG) with PD patients that do not (PD-FOG) and studied the relationship of FOG to asymmetry in gait and in rhythmic hand movement performance to determine whether potential FOG-related gait asymmetry is unique to walking or whether it is systemic. Subjects were tested in an ""off"" (unmedicated) and again in an ""on"" (medicated) state. Gait was more asymmetric in PD+FOG than in PD-FOG during ""off"" state (p = 0.005) and during ""on"" (p = 0.016). Rhythmicity of foot swing in one leg was correlated with the other leg in PD-FOG but not in PD+FOG. There was no difference in asymmetry in performance of rhythmic hand movements between the two groups. No correlation was found between asymmetry of clinical symptoms and gait asymmetry. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that bilateral uncoordinated gait and marked gait asymmetry, but not asymmetry in motor performance in general, are associated with FOG."
"Mutations in superoxide dismutase cause a subset of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and provoke progressive paralysis when expressed in mice. After retrograde transport to the spinal cord following injection into muscles, an adeno-associated virus carrying a gene that encodes a small interfering RNA was shown to target superoxide dismutase messenger RNA for degradation. The corresponding decrease in mutant superoxide dismutase in spinal motor neurons preserved grip strength. This finding provides proof of principle for the selective reduction of any neuronal protein and supports intramuscular injections of a small interfering RNA-encoding virus as a viable therapy for this type of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."
"Overproduction of interleukin-1 within the brain is associated with Alzheimer's disease and other neurological conditions. We report that peripheral administration of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors tacrine, rivastigmine, neostigmine, or EN101 (an antisense oligonucleotide directed at acetylcholinesterase messenger RNA) to mice significantly attenuated the production of interleukin-1beta in the hippocampus and blood, concomitantly with the reduction in acetylcholinesterase activity. These findings demonstrate that cholinergic enhancement produces central and peripheral antiinflammatory effects and suggest a novel therapeutic mechanism for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors."
"Several pathogenic mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2; PARK8) gene recently have been identified in familial and sporadic parkinsonism. We screened 435 Norwegian patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and 519 control subjects for the presence of 7 LRRK2 mutations. Nine patients from seven families were found to be heterozygote carriers of the LRRK2 6055G&gt;A (G2019S) mutation. Twelve of 28 first-degree relatives also carried the mutation, but only 1 had Parkinson's disease. The clinical features included asymmetric resting tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity with a good response to levodopa and could not be distinguished from idiopathic Parkinson's disease."
"Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) causes a progressive generalized dystonia which remains pharmacologically intractable. We performed bilateral internal globus pallidus stimulation in six patients with genetically confirmed PKAN who obtained a major and long-lasting improvement of their painful spasms, dystonia, and functional autonomy. This study shows the benefits of pallidal DBS for the dystonia of PKAN patients."
"Heron and colleagues (Ann Neurol 2004;55:595-596) identified three missense mutations in the Cav3.2 T-type calcium channel gene (CACNA1H) in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. None of the variants were associated with a specific epilepsy phenotype and were not found in patients with juvenile absence epilepsy or childhood absence epilepsy. Here, we introduced and functionally characterized these three mutations using transiently expressed human Cav3.2 channels. Two of the mutations exhibited functional changes that are consistent with increased channel function. Taken together, these findings along with previous reports, strongly implicate CACNA1H as a susceptibility gene in complex idiopathic generalized epilepsy."
"X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is one of a set of diseases caused by mutations in gap junction proteins called connexins. We identified a connexin32 missense mutation (F235C) in a girl with unusually severe neuropathy. The localization and trafficking of the mutant protein in cell culture was normal, but electrophysiological studies showed that the mutation caused abnormal hemichannel opening, with excessive permeability of the plasma membrane and decreased cell survival. Abnormal leakiness of connexin hemichannels is likely a mechanism of cellular toxicity in this and perhaps other diseases caused by connexin mutations."
"The effect of 12 weeks of aerobic training on a cycle ergometer was studied in 12 patients with myotonic dystrophy. Efficacy was evaluated by cycle testing and muscle morphology before and after training. Patients increased their maximal oxygen uptake by 14%, the maximal workload by 11%, muscle fiber diameter increased significantly, and creatine kinase did not increase with training. The study indicates that aerobic training is safe and can improve fitness effectively in patients with myotonic dystrophy."
Recent studies suggest a neuroprotective function of the PGE2 EP2 receptor in excitotoxic neuronal injury. The function of the EP2 receptor was examined at time points after excitotoxicity in an organotypic hippocampal model of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) challenge and in a permanent model of focal forebrain ischemia. Activation of EP2 led to significant neuroprotection in hippocampal slices up to 3 hours after a toxic NMDA stimulus. Genetic deletion of EP2 resulted in a marked increase in stroke volume in the permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion model. These findings support further investigation into therapeutic strategies targeting the EP2 receptor in stroke.
"Dermatomyositis has been modeled as an autoimmune disease largely mediated by the adaptive immune system, including a local humorally mediated response with B and T helper cell muscle infiltration, antibody and complement-mediated injury of capillaries, and perifascicular atrophy of muscle fibers caused by ischemia. To further understand the pathophysiology of dermatomyositis, we used microarrays, computational methods, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy to study muscle specimens from 67 patients, 54 with inflammatory myopathies, 14 with dermatomyositis. In dermatomyositis, genes induced by interferon-alpha/beta were highly overexpressed, and immunohistochemistry for the interferon-alpha/beta inducible protein MxA showed dense staining of perifascicular, and, sometimes all myofibers in 8/14 patients and on capillaries in 13/14 patients. Of 36 patients with other inflammatory myopathies, 1 patient had faint MxA staining of myofibers and 3 of capillaries. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells, potent CD4+ cellular sources of interferon-alpha, are present in substantial numbers in dermatomyositis and may account for most of the cells previously identified as T helper cells. In addition to an adaptive immune response, an innate immune response characterized by plasmacytoid dendritic cell infiltration and interferon-alpha/beta inducible gene and protein expression may be an important part of the pathogenesis of dermatomyositis, as it appears to be in systemic lupus erythematosus."
"It is debated whether transient symptoms associated with infarction (TSI) are best considered a minor ischemic stroke, a subtype of transient ischemic attack (TIA), or a separate ischemic brain syndrome. We studied clinical and imaging features to establish similarities and differences among ischemic stroke, TIA without infarction, and TSI. Eighty-seven consecutive patients with TIA and 74 patients with ischemic stroke were studied. All underwent diffusion-weighted imaging on admission. Symptom duration and infarct volume were determined in each group. Thirty-six patients (41.3%) with TIA had acute infarct(s). Although TIA-related infarcts were smaller than those associated with ischemic stroke (mean, 0.7 vs 27.3 ml; p &lt; 0.001), there was no lesion size threshold that distinguished ischemic stroke from TSI. In contrast, the symptom duration probability density curve was not broad, but instead peaked early with only a few patients having symptoms for longer than 200 minutes. The probability density function for symptom duration was similar between TIA with or without infarction. The in-hospital recurrent ischemic stroke and TIA rate was 19.4% in patients with TSI and 1.3% in those with ischemic stroke. TIA with infarction appears to have unique features separate from TIA without infarction and ischemic stroke. We propose identifying TSI as a separate clinical syndrome with distinct prognostic features."
"Impaired axonal transport has been postulated to play a role in the pathophysiology of multiple neurodegenerative disorders. In this report, we describe the results of clinical and neuropathological studies in a family with an inherited form of motor neuron disease caused by mutation in the p150Glued subunit of dynactin, a microtubule motor protein essential for retrograde axonal transport. Affected family members had a distinct clinical phenotype characterized by early bilateral vocal fold paralysis affecting the adductor and abductor laryngeal muscles. They later experienced weakness and atrophy in the face, hands, and distal legs. The extremity involvement was greater in the hands than in the legs, and it had a particular predilection for the thenar muscles. No clinical or electrophysiological sensory abnormality existed; however, skin biopsy results showed morphological abnormalities of epidermal nerve fibers. An autopsy study of one patient showed motor neuron degeneration and axonal loss in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and hypoglossal nucleus of the medulla. Immunohistochemistry showed abnormal inclusions of dynactin and dynein in motor neurons. This mutation of dynactin, a ubiquitously expressed protein, causes a unique pattern of motor neuron degeneration that is associated with the accumulation of dynein and dynactin in neuronal inclusions."
"Denervation was assessed in 89 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) 1, 2, and 3 subjects via motor unit number estimation (MUNE) and maximum compound motor action potential amplitude (CMAP) studies, and results correlated with SMN2 copy, age, and function. MUNE and maximum CMAP values were distinct among SMA subtypes (p &lt; 0.05). Changes in MUNE and maximum CMAP values over time were dependent on age, SMA type, and SMN2 copy number. SMN2 copy number less than 3 correlated with lower MUNE and maximum CMAP values (p &lt; 0.0001) and worse functional outcomes. As SMN2 copy number increases, so does functional status (p &lt; 0.0001). Change in MUNE longitudinally over the time intervals examined in this study was not statistically significant for any SMA cohort. However, a decline in maximum CMAP over time was apparent in SMA2 subjects (p = 0.049). Age-dependent decline in MUNE and maximum CMAP was apparent in both SMA 1 (p &lt; 0.0001) and SMA 2 (p &lt; 0.0001) subjects, with age as an independent factor regardless of type. Maximum CMAP at the time of the initial assessment was most predictive of functional outcome (p &lt; 0.0001). Prospective longitudinal studies in four prenatally diagnosed infants demonstrated significant progressive denervation in association with symptomatic onset or functional decline. These data highlight the potential value of such measures in increasing our understanding of pathophysiological factors involved in denervation in SMA."
"We prospectively examined fruit and vegetable intake in relation to cognitive function and decline among aging women. Participants were followed from in 1976 with biennial questionnaires, and food frequency questionnaires were administered in 1984, 1986, and every 4 years thereafter. From 1995 to 2001, we administered, by telephone, six cognitive tests measuring general cognition, verbal memory, category fluency, and working memory. We repeated assessments two years later for 13,388 women (&gt;90% follow-up). We averaged dietary intakes from 1984 through the first cognitive assessment, and used linear regression to obtain multivariable-adjusted mean differences in performance and decline in performance across intake levels. Fruits were not associated with cognition or cognitive decline. However, total vegetable intake was significantly associated with less decline. Specifically, on a global score combining all tests, women in the highest quintile of cruciferous vegetables declined slower (by 0.04 unit; 95% confidence interval, 0.003, 0.07; p trend = 0.1) compared with the lowest quintile. Women consuming the most green leafy vegetables also experienced slower decline than women consuming the least amount (by 0.05 unit; 95% confidence interval, 0.02, 0.09; p trend &lt; 0.001). These mean differences were equivalent to those observed for women about 1 to 2 years apart in age."
"We assessed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of tau and other biomarkers of neurodegenerative disease. CSF tau levels vary widely in reports of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). CSF samples were assayed for tau, amyloid beta1-42 (A1-42), and the isoprostane 8,12-iso-iPF2a-VI (iP) prospectively in 64 patients with FTD, retrospectively in 26 autopsied cases with FTD or Alzheimer's disease (AD), and in 13 healthy seniors. To validate our observations in vivo, we correlated CSF tau levels with cortical atrophy in 17 FTD patients using voxel-based morphometry analyses of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. CSF levels of tau, Abeta1-42, and iP differed significantly in FTD compared with AD. Individual patient analyses showed that 34% of FD patients had significantly low levels of CSF tau, although this was never seen in AD. A discriminant analysis based on CSF levels of tau, Abeta1-42, and iP was able to classify 88.5% of these patients in a manner that corresponds to their clinical or autopsy diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging studies showed that CSF tau levels correlate significantly with right frontal and left temporal cortical atrophy, brain regions known to be atrophic in patients with autopsy-proved FTD. We conclude that CSF tau levels are significantly reduced in many patients with FTD."
"We report an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder in 25 white members from a large inbred Brazilian family, 22 of whom were evaluated clinically. This condition is characterized by (1) subnormal vision secondary to apparently nonprogressive congenital optic atrophy; (2) onset of progressive spastic paraplegia in infancy; (3) onset of progressive motor and sensory axonal neuropathy in late childhood/early adolescence; (4) dysarthria starting in the third decade of life; (5) exacerbated acoustic startle response; and (6) progressive joint contractures and spine deformities. Motor handicap was severe, and all patients were wheelchair bound after 15 years old. We performed a genome-wide screen including 25 affected individuals and 49 of their unaffected relatives. Linkage was detected at 11q13 region with a maximum logarithm of odds score of +14.43, obtained with marker D11S1883. The candidate region, which lies between D11S1908 and D11S1889, encompasses approximately 4.8Mb and has more than 100 genes and expressed sequences. We propose the acronym SPOAN (spastic paraplegia, optic atrophy, and neuropathy) for this complex syndrome."
"The ability of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to prevent the onset of HIV-associated dementia and to prevent or reduce the neuropathological features of HIV encephalitis (HIVE) remains unclear. Using a severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model of HIVE, we determined the effects of regular HAART treatment on HIVE. Before studying HAART in infected SCID mice, nonmanipulated SCID mice were treated with a single injection of the HAART cocktail (consisting of zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir) to determine optimum dosage and sampling time and to measure antiretroviral levels in the brain. After these preliminary studies, SCID mice that were inoculated with either HIV-infected or uninfected human monocytes were given intraperitoneal (IP) injections of HAART three times daily over a 1- and 2-week period. All three drugs were detected in the brain using a novel drug extraction technique and a modified high-performance liquid chromatography method. HAART significantly decreased the amount of astrogliosis and viral load in treated mice compared with mice that received vehicle injections. These studies offer insight into the ability of HAART to treat HIV infection of the brain."
"Brain inflammatory reactions have been described in various neurological disorders, including epilepsy. Although there is clear evidence that cytokines affect neuroglial functions and blood-brain barrier permeability, scarce information is available on the functional consequences of brain inflammation on seizures. We studied the role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF)-alpha and its p55 and p75 receptors in seizure modulation. We found that intrahippocampal injection of murine recombinant TNF-alpha potently inhibits seizure in mice while human recombinant TNF-alpha, which shows strong specificity for mouse p55 receptors, was ineffective. p75 receptors were detected in mouse hippocampal neurons, whereas p55 receptors were absent. Transgenic mice with a perturbed TNF-alpha system showed profound alterations in seizure susceptibility: astrocytic overexpression of TNF-alpha was associated with reduced seizures, whereas mice lacking TNF-alpha p75 or both p55 and p75, receptors showed prolonged seizures. Mice deficient in p55 receptor only showed reduced seizures; and both p75 and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 protein levels were upregulated in their hippocampi. Our findings show that increased brain levels of TNF-alpha result in significant inhibition of seizures in mice, and this action is mediated by neuronal p75 receptors. This evidence highlights a novel function of TNF-alpha in brain and indicates a new system for anticonvulsive intervention."
"Both short- and long-term cognitive changes continue to occur after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), but the pathophysiology of these neurobehavioral changes remains incompletely understood. The persistence of mild postoperative neurocognitive changes despite multiple improvements in the cardiopulmonary bypass procedure may be partially because of surgical populations being older and having more prevalent comorbid disease. The cause of the early postoperative changes is most likely multifactorial and may include ischemic injury from microemboli, hypoperfusion, and other factors resulting from major surgery. Several lines of evidence suggest that the late cognitive decline between 1 and 5 years after surgery may be secondary to high rates of cerebrovascular disease among candidates for CABG. A history of hypertension and other risk factors for vascular disease is known to be associated with increased risk for long-term cognitive decline in community-dwelling elderly individuals. Cerebrovascular risk factors are also associated with silent magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities in patients undergoing CABG. Thus, whereas both short- and long-term postoperative cognitive changes have been associated with CABG, only the short-term, transient changes appear to be directly related to the use of cardiopulmonary bypass."
We describe clinical and pathological features of a case of paralytic rabies with acute axonal neuropathy that closely resembled axonal Guillain-Barre syndrome. This case emphasizes that there is overlap of both clinical and pathological features in paralytic rabies and axonal Guillain-Barre syndrome. These findings raise the possibility that infectious and autoimmune etiologies can lead to similar morphological changes in the nerves.
We tested whether transfer of the gene coding for glutamic acid decarboxylase to dorsal root ganglion using a herpes simplex virus vector to achieve release of GABA in dorsal horn would attenuate nociception in this condition. Subcutaneous inoculation of a replication-defective herpes simplex virus vector expressing glutamic acid decarboxylase (vector QHGAD67) 7 days after selective L5 spinal nerve ligation reversed mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia; the antiallodynic effect lasted 6 weeks and was reestablished by reinoculation. QHGAD67 inoculation also suppressed induction of c-Fos and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 in the spinal cord.
"We detected a missense mutation in the kinase domain of the LRRK2 gene in members with autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease of the Japanese family (the Sagamihara family) who served as the basis for the original defining of the PARK8 Parkinson's disease locus. The results of the Sagamihara family, in combination with the unique pathological features characterized by pure nigral degeneration without Lewy bodies, provided us with valuable information for elucidating the protein structure-pathogenesis relationship for the gene product of LRRK2. We did not detect this mutation or other known mutations of the LRRK2 gene in Japanese patients with sporadic Parkinson's disease."
"Previous work has suggested that in many neurological diseases genetic variability in the loci predisposing subjects to autosomal dominant disease contributes to the risk of sporadic disease. Here, using a population-based sample of dystonia cases, we show an association with the torsin A haplotype and sporadic idiopathic dystonia."
"Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) is a chronic infection in which B-cell activation, plasma cell infiltration, and enhanced Ig production in infected tissue are prominent feature. However, little is known about how B cells and plasma cells invade and persist in target organs. To assess this issue, we developed real-time PCR measurements of IgG and CXCL13 production. We used these RNA assays and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for protein and demonstrated that human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), stimulated by Borrelia burgdorferi sonicate, produced CXCL13 and IgG. Magnetic separation of PBMC populations and flow cytometry showed that CXCL13 is produced by dendritic cells. We then measure the expression of CXCL13 and IgG in tissues and correlated the expression of these host genes with spirochetal load. We also measured expression of dbpA and BBK32, two spirochetal genes important in chronic infection. There was a strong correlation between host immune response gene expression (CXCL13 and IgG) and spirochetal load. Immunohistochemistry of infected nonhuman primates tissue confirmed that CXCL13 is expressed in the nervous system. We conclude that persistent production of CXCL13 and IgG within infected tissue, two characteristics of ectopic germinal centers, are definitive features of LNB."
"To investigate the incompletely understood somatotopical organization of the corticospinal tract in the human brainstem, we performed a voxel-based statistical analysis of standardized magnetic resonance scans of 41 prospectively recruited patients with pyramidal tract dysfunction caused by acute brainstem infarction. Motor hemiparesis was rated clinically and by the investigation of motor evoked potentials to arms and legs. Infarction affected the pons in 85% of cases. We found the greatest level of significance of affected brainstem areas between the pontomesencephalic junction and the mid pons. Lesion location was significantly more dorsal in patients with hemiparesis affecting more proximal muscles and was significantly more ventral in patients with predominantly distal limb paresis. Comparison of magnetic resonance lesion from patients with paresis predominantly affecting arm or leg did not show significant topographical differences. We conclude that a topographical arm/leg distribution of corticospinal fibers is abruptly broken down as the descending corticospinal tract traverses the pons. Corticospinal fibers, however, follow a somatotopical order in the pons with fibers controlling proximal muscles being located close to the reticular formation in the dorsal pontine base, and thus more dorsal than the fibers controlling further distal muscle groups."
"Cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity is decreased in patients with Alzheimer's disease. It is being debated whether this reflects diminished demand because of advanced neurodegeneration or that cerebral hypoperfusion contributes to dementia. We examined the relation of CBF velocity as measured with transcranial Doppler with dementia and markers of incipient dementia (ie, cognitive decline and hippocampal and amygdalar atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging) in 1,730 participants of the Rotterdam Study aged 55 years and older. Cognitive decline in the 6.5 years preceding CBF velocity measurement was assessed with repeated Mini-Mental State Examinations in nondemented subjects (n = 1,716). Hippocampal and amygdalar volumes were assessed in a subset of 170 nondemented subjects. Subjects with greater CBF velocity were less likely to have dementia. Furthermore, in nondemented subjects, greater CBF velocity was related to significantly less cognitive decline over the preceding period (odds ratio per standard deviation increase in mean CBF 0.74 [95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.98]) and larger hippocampal and amygdalar volumes. A low CBF is associated with dementia, but also with markers of incipient dementia. Although we cannot exclude that this is caused by preclinical neurodegeneration leading to hypoperfusion, it does suggest that cerebral hypoperfusion precedes and possibly contributes to onset of clinical dementia."
"Amyloid beta peptide (A beta) has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an initiator of the pathological cascades. Several lines of compelling evidence have supported major roles of A beta-degrading enzyme neprilysin in the pathogenesis of sporadic AD. Here, we have shown a substantial reduction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neprilysin activity (CSF-NEP) in patients with AD-converted mild cognitive impairment and early AD as compared with age-matched control subjects. The altered CSF-NEP likely reflects changes in neuronal neprilysin, since transfer of neprilysin from brain tissue into CSF was demonstrated by injecting neprilysin-carrying viral vector into the brains of neprilysin-deficient mice. Interestingly, CSF-NEP showed an elevation with the progression of AD. Along with a close association of CSF-NEP with CSF tau proteins, this finding suggests that presynaptically located neprilysin can be released into CSF as a consequence of synaptic disruption. The impact of neuronal damages on CSF-NEP was further demonstrated by a prominent increase of CSF-NEP in rats exhibiting kainate-induced neurodegeneration. Our results unequivocally indicate significance of CSF-NEP as a biochemical indicator to pursue a pathological process that involves decreased neprilysin activity and A beta-induced synaptic toxicity, and the support the potential benefits of neprilysin up-regulation in ameliorating neuropathology in prodromal and early AD."
"The NOA-03 trial explored high-dose methotrexate alone in 37 patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma. The overall median survival was 25 months. After 4 years, the rate of leukoencephalopathy in patients surviving more than 12 months was 58% with and 10% without whole-brain radiotherapy given at relapse (p = 0.11). Attention deficits were found in all six tested patients, and memory deficits in four patients. Two patients had normal, three had moderately restricted, and one had markedly restricted quality of life. Thus, high-dose methotrexate with deferred radiotherapy had only moderate efficacy and was associated with significant neurotoxicity in long-term surviving patients."
"To evaluate the role of molecular genetics in the routine clinic, we investigated allelic imbalance at 1p36, 19q13, 17p13, 10p12-15, and 10q22-26 and p53 mutation in 100 oligodendroglial neoplasms diagnosed at a single treatment center between 2000 and 2003. The -1p/-19q genotype, seen in 64, 34, 77, and 30% of OII, OAII, OIII, and OAIII respectively, was inversely related to p53 mutation and 17p13 loss. Genotype was unrelated to tumor location and could not distinguish high-grade tumors that presented de novo from those that progressed from a previous lower grade malignancy. Presentation with seizures was more common in cases with the -1p/-19q genotype, and these remained stable for longer before treatment. In longitudinal samples, 74% retained their initial histological differentiation, whereas 29% showed new genetic alterations, the -1p/-19q genotype being acquired in three cases. Loss of 1p36 and 19q13, 17p13, chromosome 10, and p53 mutation were significantly associated with survival from presentation in Kaplan-Meier analysis (p &lt; 0.01), and loss of 1p36 and 19q13 and loss of 17p13 retained significance in multivariate analysis. In this recently diagnosed unselected series, clinical differences in tumors with and without the -1p/-19q genotype support a genetic approach to aid diagnosis and prognostication for oligodendroglial neoplasms."
"We examined whether the presence of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions and vessel occlusion on acute brain magnetic resonance images of minor stroke and transient ischemic attack patients predicted the occurrence of subsequent stroke and functional outcome. 120 transient ischemic attack or minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale &lt; or = 3) patients were prospectively enrolled. All were examined within 12 hours and had a magnetic resonance scan within 24 hours. Overall, the 90-day risk for recurrent stroke was 11.7%. Patients with a DWI lesion were at greater risk for having a subsequent stroke than patients without and risk was greatest in the presence of vessel occlusion and a DWI lesion. The 90-day risk rates, adjusted for baseline characteristics, were 4.3% (no DWI lesion), 10.8% (DWI lesion but no vessel occlusion), and 32.6% (DWI lesion and vessel occlusion) (p = 0.02). The percentages of patients who were functionally dependent at 90 days in the three groups were 1.9%, 6.2%, and 21.0%, respectively (p = 0.04). The presence of a DWI lesion and a vessel occlusion on a magnetic resonance image among patients presenting acutely with a transient ischemic attack or minor stroke is predictive of an increased risk for future stroke and functional dependence."
"Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS) an autosomal recessive hepatocerebral syndrome of early onset, has been associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion and mutations in polymerase gamma gene (POLG). We have identified POLG mutations in four patients with hepatocerebral syndrome and mtDNA depletion in liver, who fulfilled criteria for AHS. All were compound heterozygous for the G848S and W748S mutations, previously reported in patients with progressive external ophtalmoplegia or ataxia. We conclude that AHS should be included in the clinical spectrum of mtDNA depletion and is often associated with POLG mutations, which can cause either multiple mtDNA deletions or mtDNA depletion."
"Photosensitivity or photoparoxysmal response (PPR) is a common and highly heritable electroencephalographic trait characterized by an abnormal visual sensitivity of the brain in reaction to intermittent photic stimulation. PPR occurs frequently associated with idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGEs). The present genomewide linkage scan was designed to map susceptibility loci for PPR and to explore their genetic relationship with IGE. The study included 60 families with at least two siblings displaying PPR. To dissect PPR-specific and IGE-related susceptibility loci, we defined two distinct family subgroups, comprising 19 families with predominantly pure PPR and photosensitive seizures (PPR-families) and 25 families, in which PPR was strongly associated with IGE (PPR/IGE-families). MOD score analyses provided significant evidence for linkage to the region 6p21.2 in the PPR-families (empirical p = 0.00004) and suggestive evidence for linkage to the region 13q31.3 in the PPR/IGE families (p = 0.00015), both with a best-fitting recessive mode of inheritance. In the PPR/IGE-families, linkage evidence was even stronger (p = 0.00003) when the trait definition was broadened by IGE traits. Our study shows two PPR-related susceptibility loci, depending on the familial background of IGE. The locus on 6p21.2 seems to predispose to PPR itself, whereas the locus on 13q31.3 also confers susceptibility to IGE."
"Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation improves recovery from ischemic stroke in animals. We examined the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of cell therapy using culture-expanded autologous MSCs in patients with ischemic stroke. We prospectively and randomly allocated 30 patients with cerebral infarcts within the middle cerebral arterial territory and with severe neurological deficits into one of two treatment groups: the MSC group (n = 5) received intravenous infusion of 1 x 10(8) autologous MSCs, whereas the control group (n = 25) did not receive MSCs. Changes in neurological deficits and improvements in function were compared between the groups for 1 year after symptom onset. Neuroimaging was performed serially in five patients from each group. Outcomes improved in MSC-treated patients compared with the control patients: the Barthel index (p = 0.011, 0.017, and 0.115 at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively) and modified Rankin score (p = 0.076, 0.171, and 0.286 at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively) of the MSC group improved consistently during the follow-up period. Serial evaluations showed no adverse cell-related, serological, or imaging-defined effects. In patients with severe cerebral infarcts, the intravenous infusion of autologous MSCs appears to be a feasible and safe therapy that may improve functional recovery."
"The tyrosine kinase receptor RON and its ligand, macrophage stimulating protein (MSP), exert inhibitory effects on systemic innate immunity, but their CNS expression and impact on human neuroinflammatory diseases are unknown were RON and MSP present in human brain perivascular macrophages and microglia, but RON mRNA and protein abundance in the CNS were diminished in both MS patients and the MS animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Treatment of differentiated human monocytoid cells with MSP resulted in significant reduction of interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and MMP-9 mRNA levels, whereas minimal effects were observed in human astrocytes. After induction of EAE, RON knockout and heterozygote animals exhibited significantly increased CNS proinflammatory gene (TNF-alpha, MMP-12) expression compared with wild-type littermate controls, although IL-4 levels were suppressed in both RON-deficient groups. Neurological disease in RON-deficient animals showed a more rapid onset with overall worsened severity, together with exacerbated demyelination, axonal injury, and neuroinflammation after EAE induction. The proto-oncogene, c-Cbl, which modulates ubiquitylation of RON, was increased in glia in both MS brains and EAE spinal cords. Thus, the MSP-RON pathway represents a novel regulatory mechanism within the CNS by which innate immunity and its pathogenic effects could be targeted for future therapeutic interventions."
"The cornu ammonis 1 region of the hippocampus (CA1) sector of hippocampus is vulnerable to both Alzheimer's disease (AD)-type neurofibrillary degeneration and anoxia-ischemia. The objective of this article is to compare number and size of neurons in CA1 in AD versus ischemic vascular dementia. Unbiased stereological methods were used to estimate the number and volume of neurons in 28 autopsy-derived brain samples. For each case, the entire hippocampus from one cerebral hemisphere was sliced into 5mm slabs (5-7 slabs/case), cut into 50 microm sections, and stained with gallocyanine. Using the optical dissector, we systematically sampled the number and size of neurons throughout the extent of CA1 and CA2. The total number of neurons was significantly less in AD compared with ischemic vascular dementia (p &lt; 0.02), but there was no significant difference in neuron size. The greatest loss of neurons was observed in two cases with combined AD and hippocampal sclerosis. Regardless of causative diagnosis, the number of CA1 neurons correlates with magnetic resonance imaging-derived hippocampal volume (r = 0.72; p &lt; 0.001) and memory score (r = 0.62; p &lt; 0.01). We conclude that although CA1 neuron loss is more consistently observed in AD than ischemic vascular dementia, severity of loss shows the expected correlation with structure and function across causative subtype. Reductions in magnetic resonance imaging-derived hippocampal volume reflect loss, rather than shrinkage, of CA1 neurons."
"We compared the diagnostic capabilities of contrast reversal and sparse pattern pulse stimulation for dichoptic multifocal visual evoked potentials (mfVEPs) measured in normal subjects and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Multifocal responses were obtained from 27 normal subjects and 50 relapsing-remitting patients, 26 of whom had experienced optic neuritis (ON+). The patient groups were matched for length of disease and number of clinical attacks. Compared with the responses of normal subjects those of MS patients had significantly smaller response amplitudes, lower signal-to-noise ratios, more complex response waveforms, and longer response delays. The effects were larger for sparser stimuli. Sensitivities and specificities for the different stimulus types were estimated from receiver operator characteristic (ROC) plots. Bootstrap estimates of the accuracies of the ROCs for the most promising measure, the template delays, indicated the sparsest stimulus would deliver 92% sensitivity at a false-positive rate of 0%. In contrast, at 92% sensitivity the conventional mfVEP stimulus misdiagnosed more than 20% of the normal population. The results were similar for patients with no history of ON (ON-). In performing well in patients with no history of ON, the sparse mfVEPs seem to measure progressive damage associated with axon and gray matter losses rather than damage associated with a history of serious inflammation."
"Lacunar infarcts are commonly found in the basal ganglia, though little is known about the organization of small-scale microvascular territories that presumably subtend lacunae. We investigated microvascular territories of the lenticulostriate arteries, the recurrent artery of Heubner, the anterior choroidal artery, and striate branches of the anterior cerebral and anterior communicating arteries in perfusion-fixed human brains by simultaneous injection of fluorescent dyes and a radio-opaque substance in 5% gelatin. Territories were defined by ultraviolet illumination of dye and high-resolution mammography of radio-opaque substance. Brains were sectioned coplanar with the Talairach proportional grid system and vascular data were plotted, allowing for application to any human brain. The data suggest first that the lenticulostriate artery, recurrent artery of Heubner, and anterior choroidal artery supply distinct territories of the basal ganglia with minimal overlap and sparse anastomoses between major penetrating vessels. Individual territories are spatially consistent across brains and match the extent of major/minor infarcts. Second, branching patterns of parental, second-, and third-order vessels leading to circumscribed terminal vascular beds could account structurally for ""lacunar"" infarcts."
"Recent studies of enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis by antidepressants suggest enhancement of neurogenesis is a potentially effective therapy in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we evaluated nigral neurogenesis in animals and autopsy brains including patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). First, proliferating cells in substantia nigra were labeled with retroviral transduction of green fluorescent protein, which is an efficient method to label neuronal stem cells. Subsequent differentiation of labeled cells was followed; many transduced cells became microglia, but no differentiation into tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons was detected at 4 weeks after injection, in both intact rodents and those treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. Second, polysialic acid (PSA)-like immunoreactivity, indicative of newly differentiated neurons, was detected in the substantia nigra of rodent, primate, and human midbrains. A large number of PSA-positive cells were detected in the substantia nigra pars reticulata of some patients with PD. In rats and a macaque monkey, the dopamine-depleted hemispheres showed more PSA staining than the intact side. A small number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells were PSA-positive. Our results suggest enhanced neural reconstruction in PD, which may be important in the design of new therapies against the progression of PD."
"The rare primary headache short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) is characterized by 3 to 200 attacks per day of severe unilateral orbital pain. Functional magnetic resonance imaging shows increased blood flow in the ipsilateral posterior inferior hypothalamus during attacks, indicating activation. We report the first patient with SUNCT in whom severe intractable pain (70 per day) was well controlled by electrode implant to and continuous stimulation of the posterior inferior hypothalamus. Ann Neurol 2005;57:925-927."
"Various C-terminally truncated amyloid beta peptides (Abeta) are linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of Abeta38, Abeta40, and Abeta42 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 30 patients with AD and 26 control subjects. CSF Abeta42 levels was decreased in patients with AD, whereas CSF Abeta38 and Abeta40 levels were similar in patients with AD and control subjects. All three Abeta peptides were interrelated, particularly CSF Abeta38 and Abeta40. Diagnostic accuracy of CSF Abeta42 concentrations was not improved by applying the ratios of CSF Abeta42 to Abeta38 or Abeta40."
"In a prospective, population-based cohort study among 5,920 participants aged 55 years or older, we observed that the TT variant of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymorphism is associated with an increased risk for Parkinson's disease in smokers. Both smoking and the TT genotype are known to induce hyperhomocystinemia, and synergistic effects on homocysteine levels have been reported. Increased plasma levels of homocysteine through direct neurotoxic effects might accelerate the selective dopaminergic cell death underlying Parkinson's disease. Our findings support the hypothesis that homocysteine plays a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease."
"In contrast with acquired pain syndromes, molecular substrates for hereditary pain disorders have been poorly understood. Familial erythromelalgia (Weir Mitchell's disease), also known as primary erythermalgia, is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by burning pain in the extremities in response to warm stimuli or moderate exercise. The cause of this disorder has been enigmatic, and treatment has been empirical and not very effective. Recent studies, however, have shown that familial erythromelalgia is a channelopathy caused by mutations in the gene encoding the Na(v)1.7 sodium channel which lead to altered channel function. Selective expression of Na(v)1.7 within dorsal root ganglion neurons including nociceptors (in which this channel is targeted to sensory terminals, close to impulse trigger zones) and within sympathetic ganglion neurons explains why patients experience pain but do not suffer from seizures or other manifestations of altered excitability within central nervous system neurons. Erythromelalgia is the first human disorder in which it has been possible to associate an ion channel mutation with chronic neuropathic pain. Identification of mutations within a peripheral neuron-specific sodium channel suggests the possibility of rational therapies that target the affected channel. Moreover, because some other pain syndromes, including acquired disorders, involve altered sodium channel function, erythromelalgia may emerge as a model disease that holds more general lessons about the molecular neurobiology of chronic pain."
"The atypical febrile seizure has important clinical implications because of its association with the mesial temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome, which is the most common of the intractable epilepsies. However, whether a causal relation exists between these conditions is currently unknown. We have previously shown that a focal cortical lesion induced in the neonatal rat predisposes to the development of atypical hyperthermic seizures. We show here that 86% of the lesion plus hyperthermia group experience development of spontaneous recurrent seizures recorded from the amygdala ipsilateral to the lesion. Control rats did not have spontaneous recurrent behavioral or electrographic seizures. Lesioned rats with hyperthermic seizures also showed an impaired performance on the Morris water maze when compared with naive control rats, suggesting mild deficits in learning and memory. These findings support a link between the atypical febrile seizure and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, and at the same time establish a new model for this condition through which new preventative and therapeutic strategies can be tested."
"Dystonia is a neurological syndrome characterized by sustained muscle contractions that produce repetitive twisting movements or abnormal postures. X-linked recessive dystonia parkinsonism (XDP; DYT3; Lubag) is an adult-onset disorder that manifests severe and progressive dystonia with a high frequency of generalization. In search for the anatomical basis for dystonia, we performed postmortem analyses of the functional anatomy of the basal ganglia based on the striatal compartments (ie, the striosomes and the matrix compartment) in XDP. Here, we provide anatomopathological evidence that, in the XDP neostriatum, the matrix compartment is relatively spared in a unique fashion, whereas the striosomes are severely depleted. We also document that there is a differential loss of striatal neuron subclasses in XDP. In view of the three-pathway basal ganglia model, we postulate that the disproportionate involvement of neostriatal compartments and their efferent projections may underlie the manifestation of dystonia in patients with XDP. This study is the first to our knowledge to show specific basal ganglia pathology that could explain the genesis of dystonia in human heredodegenerative movement disorders, suggesting that dystonia may result from an imbalance in the activity between the striosomal and matrix-based pathways."
"T cells are considered to play a pivotal role in orchestrating the self-reactive immune responses in multiple sclerosis (MS). Programmed death 1 (PD-1) is a member of the B7/CD28 superfamily of costimulatory molecules exerting inhibitory functions on T cells. Recently, an intronic 7146G/A polymorphism within the PD-1 gene was described and suggested to be associated with autoimmunity. We investigated whether this genetic polymorphism is a genetic modifier for risk and progression of MS. Blood samples from 939 German MS patients (mean age, 39 years; range, 13-71; 566 patients [60%] with relapsing-remitting MS, 279 (30%) with secondary, and 94 (10%) with primary progressive MS) and 272 healthy white controls were tested. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion; results were confirmed by automatic sequencing. A significant association of the mutated allele with a progressive disease course was detected (44% 7146G vs 56% 7146A, chi(2) p = 0.002). Consequences of the PD-1 mutation for T-cell function were assessed ex vivo in some patients using microsphere-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes and purified CD4 cells. Importantly, PD-1-mediated inhibition of T-cell cytokine secretion (interferon-gamma) is impaired in patients carrying the PD-1 polymorphism. In conclusion, our data suggest that PD-1 polymorphism is a genetic modifier of the progression of MS, possibly through inducing a partial defect in PD-1-mediated inhibition of T-cell activation."
"Previously, we reported evidence of genetic heterogeneity in late-onset familial Alzheimer's disease, based on sex of affected parent, demonstrating linkage to chromosome 10q, a region identified by other groups and implicated as a quantitative trait loci for Abeta levels, in families with an affected mother. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a memory encoding task, we now show differential brain activation patterns among asymptomatic offspring which correspond to the previous linkage finding. These results suggest the possibility that activation patterns may prove useful as a preclinical quantitative trait related to the putative familial late-onset AD gene in this chromosome 10 region."
"The electroencephalographic response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) recently has been established as a direct parameter of motor cortex excitability. Its N100 component was suggested to reflect an inhibitory response. We investigated influences of cerebral maturation on TMS-evoked N100 in 6- to 10-year-old healthy children. We used a forewarned reaction time (contingent negative variation) task to test the effects of response preparation and sensory attention on N100 amplitude. Single-pulse TMS of motor cortex at 105% motor threshold intensity evoked N100 amplitudes of more than 100 microV in resting children (visible in single trials), which correlated negatively with age and positively with absolute stimulation intensity. During late contingent negative variation, which involves preactivation of the cortical structures necessary for a fast response, N100 amplitude was significantly reduced. We conclude that (1) N100 amplitude reduction during late contingent negative variation provides further evidence that TMS-evoked N100 reflects inhibitory processes, (2) response preparation and attention modulate N100, and (3) TMS-evoked N100 undergoes maturational changes and could serve to test cortical integrity and inhibitory function in children. Parallels between the inhibitory N100 after TMS (provoking massive synchronous excitation) and the inhibitory wave component of epileptic spike wave complexes are suggested."
"Hypertension has been associated with subclinical injury in the brain and may therefore increase the impact of an incident stroke on cognitive function. The Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) is a prospective, observational study of 9,704 women aged 65 years and older recruited from four U.S. metropolitan areas. Blood pressure was measured at study entry, and cognitive decline was defined by the change from prestroke to poststroke cognitive testing. During an average follow-up of 6.8 years, incident stroke occurred in 260 participants (3.1%) who had previously completed baseline cognitive testing. Among participants with stroke, 119 completed follow-up cognitive testing a median of 1.9 years after the stroke, 80 died before the next study visit, and 61 did not complete further cognitive testing. After adjustment for demographic factors and other confounders, pre-existing hypertension was a strong predictor of cognitive decline when a stroke occurred (odds ratio [OR], 4.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37-12.1). In contrast, hypertension was only weakly associated with cognitive decline in the absence of stroke (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.04-1.22) (p for interaction = 0.032). Pre-existing hypertension in women is associated with a greater impact of stroke on cognitive function, possibly by influencing the ability to tolerate or recover from brain injury."
"We tested the efficacy and safety of glutamine (0.6 gm/kg/day) and creatine (5 gm/day) in 50 ambulant boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy in a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Drug efficacy was tested by measuring muscle strength manually (34 muscle groups) and quantitatively (10 muscle groups). Timed functional tests, functional parameters, and pulmonary function tests were secondary outcome measures. Although there was no statistically significant effect of either therapy based on manual and quantitative measurements of muscle strength, a disease-modifying effect of creatine in older Duchenne muscular dystrophy and creatine and glutamine in younger Duchenne muscular dystrophy cannot be excluded. Creatine and glutamine were well tolerated."
"Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide levels are widely measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in Alzheimer's disease research. Here, we show that oligomerization of Abeta results in underestimated Abeta ELISA levels. The implications are that comprehensive analysis of soluble Abeta requires either sample pretreatment at denaturing conditions or novel conformation-dependent immunoassays. Our findings might be of relevance for many neurodegenerative disorders in which soluble protein aggregates are the main neurotoxic species."
"Receptor end organs and free-nerve endings in the skin are the peripheral sentinels of the sensorial nervous system encoding for touch, temperature, and pain. Using a novel approach to analyze the outermost nerves of the skin, we visualized for the first time the distinct microanatomical structure of the touch dome of human hairy skin. The dermal nerve fibers of this slowly adapting type 1 mechanoreceptor were embedded in dermal protrusions that could be readily discerned by Laminin-5 staining. Concerning the nerves supplying the touch domes, we found, unexpectedly, that besides Abeta-fibers, Adelta- and C-fibers also were regularly present. The epidermis overlying the nerve convolutes showed a distinctive architecture of the rete ridges clearly demarcated from the surroundings and extending over 0.193 +/- 0.138 mm(2) (mean +/- standard deviation). Within this area, 756 +/- 386 Merkel cells/mm(2) (mean +/- standard deviation) were present compared with less than 50/mm(2) outside the touch dome, demonstrating for the first time a highly discontinuous distribution of these cells in nonglabrous skin. Our findings strongly suggest that the receptive qualities of human touch domes exceed mechanosensation, and that they may serve as multifunctional nerve end organs in human skin."
"Hypothermia after perinatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) is neuroprotective; the precise brain temperature that provides optimal protection is unknown. To assess the pattern of brain injury with 3 different rectal temperatures, we randomized 42 newborn piglets: (Group i) sham-normothermia (38.5-39 degrees C); (Group ii) sham-33 degrees C; (Group iii) HI-normothermia; (Group iv) HI-35 degrees C; and (Group v) HI-33 degrees C. Groups iii through v were subjected to transient HI insult. Groups ii, iv, and v were cooled to their target rectal temperatures between 2 and 26 hours after resuscitation. Experiments were terminated at 48 hours. Compared with normothermia, hypothermia at 35 degrees C led to 25 and 39% increases in neuronal viability in cortical gray matter (GM) and deep GM, respectively (both p &lt; 0.05); hypothermia at 33 degrees C resulted in a 55% increase in neuronal viability in cortical GM (p &lt; 0.01) but no significant increase in neuronal viability in deep GM. Comparing hypothermia at 35 and 33 degrees C, 35 degrees C resulted in more viable neurons in deep GM, whereas 33 degrees C resulted in more viable neurons in cortical GM (both p &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that optimal neuroprotection by delayed hypothermia may occur at different temperatures in the cortical and deep GM. To obtain maximum benefit, you may need to design patient-specific hypothermia protocols by combining systemic and selective cooling."
"Amphiphysin-IgG was identified in 71 patients among 120,000 evaluated serologically for paraneoplastic autoantibodies. Clinical information was available for 63 patients. Cancer was detected in 50 (mostly limited), proven histologically in 46, and was imaged intrathoracically in 4 patients (lung, small-cell [27] and non-small cell [1]), breast [16] and melanoma [2]). Neurological accompaniments included (decreasing frequency): neuropathy, encephalopathy, myelopathy, stiff-man phenomena, and cerebellar syndrome. In a case examined neuropathologically, parenchymal T-lymphocyte infiltration (predominantly CD8(+)) was prominent in lower brainstem, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglion. Coexisting paraneoplastic autoantibodies, identified in 74% of patients, predicted a common neoplasm and indicated other neuronal autoantigen targets that plausibly explained several neurological manifestations; for example, P/Q-type Ca(2+)-channel antibody with Lambert-Eaton syndrome (n = 5), anti-neuronal nuclear antibody type 1 with sensory neuronopathy (n = 7), K(+)-channel antibody with limbic encephalitis (n = 1) or neuromyotonia (n = 1), and collapsin response-mediator protein-5-IgG with optic neuritis (n = 3). Patients with isolated amphiphysin-IgG (n = 19) were more likely to be women (with breast cancer, p &lt; 0.05) and to have myelopathy or stiff-man phenomena (p &lt; 0.01). Overall, a minority of women (39%) and men (12%) had stiff-man phenomena. Only 10% of women (some with lung carcinoma) and 4% of men fulfilled diagnostic criteria for stiff-man syndrome."
"Periventricular white matter injury (PWMI) is the leading cause of cerebral palsy and chronic neurological disability in survivors of prematurity. Despite the large number of affected children, the pathogenetic mechanisms related to PWMI remain controversial. Through studies of 33 human autopsy brains, we determined that early PWMI was related to oxidative damage that particularly targeted the oligodendrocyte lineage, whereas other neuronal and glial cell types were markedly more resistant. F(2)-isoprostanes, an arachidinate metabolite/lipid peroxidation marker of oxidative damage, were significantly increased in early PWMI lesions but not in cerebral cortex. That deleterious lipid peroxidation accompanied early PWMI was supported by similar increases in F(2)-isoprostanes levels in the cerebral cortex from term infants with hypoxic-ischemic cortical injury. Detection of F(4)-neuroprostanes, a neuronal-specific oxidative damage marker, confirmed that neuroaxonal elements were resistant to injury in cerebral cortex and white matter. Significant protein nitration was not detected in PWMI lesions by 3-nitrotyrosine staining. Significant cellular degeneration was confirmed in early PWMI lesions by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling and a marked depletion of oligodendrocyte progenitors of 71 +/- 8%. Hence, the predilection of preterm infants for PWMI is related to selective lipid peroxidation-mediated injury of cerebral white matter and targeted death of oligodendrocyte progenitors."
"A 12-year-old boy with mental retardation, obesity, ataxia, and visual impairment was shown to have normal fasting plasma triglyceride but low cholesterol and vitamin E levels. Investigations indicated that he was compound heterozygous for two mutations in the apolipoprotein B gene (APOB), resulting in a failure to express apolipoprotein B-100, yet retain apolipoprotein B-48 production. The proband therefore was able to form chylomicrons, but not a low-density lipoprotein capable of receptor-mediated endocytosis. This resulted in chronic vitamin E deficiency. We suggest the term normotriglyceridemic hypobetalipoproteinemia for this easily recognizable condition."
"Severe 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydrobiopterin synthase deficiency is a tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency disorder that presents in infancy with developmental delay, seizures, and abnormal movements associated with hyperphenylalaninemia usually detectable by neonatal phenylketonuria screening programs. We describe an 8-year-old girl with delay, seizures, and dystonia with mild hyperphenylalaninemia detected in late childhood. The diagnosis of 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydrobiopterin synthase deficiency was made by analysis of pterins in urine, pterins and neurotransmitters in cerebrospinal fluid, and enzyme assay. The patient improved clinically taking oral tetrahydrobiopterin, levodopa/carbidopa, and 5-hydroxytryptophan. This treatable condition may not always be detected by routine population screening for hyperphenylalaninemia."
"University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test data from control subjects (n = 63), patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 147), and patients with Alzheimer's disease (n = 100) were analyzed to derive an optimal subset of items related to risk for Alzheimer's disease (ie, healthy through mild cognitive impairment to early and moderate disease stages). The derived 10-item scale performed comparably with the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test in classifying subjects, and it strongly predicted conversion to Alzheimer's disease on follow-up evaluation in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Independent replication is needed to validate these findings."
"The ability of the central nervous system to form motor memories, a process contributing to motor learning and skill acquisition, decreases with age. Dopaminergic activity, one of the mechanisms implicated in memory formation, experiences a similar decline with aging. It is possible that restoring dopaminergic function in elderly adults could lead to improved formation of motor memories with training. We studied the influence of a single oral dose of levodopa (100mg) administered preceding training on the ability to encode an elementary motor memory in the primary motor cortex of elderly and young healthy volunteers in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Attention to the task and motor training kinematics were comparable across age groups and sessions. In young subjects, encoding a motor memory under placebo was more prominent than in older subjects, and the encoding process was accelerated by intake of levodopa. In the elderly group, diminished motor memory encoding under placebo was enhanced by intake of levodopa to levels present in younger subjects. Therefore, upregulation of dopaminergic activity accelerated memory formation in young subjects and restored the ability to form a motor memory in elderly subjects; possible mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of dopaminergic agents on motor learning in neurorehabilitation."
"The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has functions that may contribute to brain infarction (BI). In 459 matched pairs of white patients and control subjects, we measured plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, seven polymorphisms (angiotensinogen T174M and M235T, ACE I/D and 4656 2/3CT repeat [rpt], angiotensin II type 1 receptor A1166C and A153G, and aldosterone synthase CYP11B2), and evaluated 5-year poststroke mortality. Mean plasma ACE levels (+/-standard error) were significantly greater in patients than control subjects (37.5 +/- 0.9 vs 33.9 +/- 0.9), in patients with lacunar stroke, and in patients with no previous vascular (cerebrovascular or cardiovascular) history. The risk for BI increased with tertiles of plasma ACE, without an interaction with hypertension. After adjustments, the association disappeared except among patients with cardioembolic BI and those without previous vascular events. Among the polymorphisms, there was a weak association of BI with angiotensin II type 1 receptor 1166C, a weak protective effect with angiotensinogen 174M, and a strong association of angiotensinogen 235T with 5-year vascular mortality. These results suggest that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity and genes contribute to cerebrovascular disease and poststroke vascular death in white patients."
"Female patients experience substantial neuroprotection after experimental stroke compared with male patients, a finding attributed to the protective effects of gonadal hormones. This study examined the response of male- and female-derived organotypic hippocampal slices to oxidative and excitotoxic injury. Both oxygen and glucose deprivation and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid exposure led to neuronal death; however, female-derived cultures sustained less injury than male-derived cultures. Cell death after oxygen and glucose deprivation was ameliorated in male cultures, but not female cultures, by the addition of 7-nitroindazole, a neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. These studies have relevance to researchers investigating neuroprotective agents in mixed sex experiments."
"Childhood opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome can occur with or without associated neuroblastoma. An autoimmune pathogenesis has been discussed for both forms. We show here that the majority of children with opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (10/14) have autoantibodies binding to the surface of isolated rat cerebellar granular neurons. In some patients, these antibodies are masked by IgG binding to ubiquitous surface antigens, which could be removed by preincubation with the nonneuronal control cell line HEK 293. A newly introduced competitive binding assay showed that the surface binding is directed against the same autoantigen in different patients. Therefore, we hypothesize that opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome may be the result of an autoimmune process against a neuronal surface protein."
"Some carriers of a ""premutation"" allele of the FMR1 gene develop late-onset tremor/ataxia. We conducted a magnetic resonance imaging volumetric study in an unselected sample of eight older male premutation carriers. Volumetric measures, including total brain volume, and the volumes of cerebrum, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex all were significantly reduced in premutation carriers compared with similar data from 21 age-matched normal controls. Total brain and cerebral volumes were significantly related to the number of CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene. Moreover, increased hippocampal volume indicates this premutation may account for both neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental changes."
"Search for loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 1p, 9p, 10q, and 19q, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene amplification, and p53 expression was performed in a series of 131 low-grade gliomas. The profile of molecular changes, clinical findings, and histology were subsequently correlated with the course of the disease, mainly progression-free survival. When these parameters were considered as candidate variables in a multivariate analysis, only loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 1p was associated with increased progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.521), indicating a major favorable prognostic role of this genetic alteration in low-grade gliomas."
"Human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is associated with cellular alterations (eg, hilar cell death, neurogenesis, and granule cell dispersion) in the dentate gyrus but their underlying molecular mechanism are not known. We previously demonstrated increased expression of cystatin C, a protease inhibitor linked to both neurodegeneration and neurogenesis, during epileptogenesis in the rat hippocampus. Here, we investigated cystatin C expression in the dentate gyrus in chronic epilepsy and its association with neuronal loss and neurogenesis. In both rats with epilepsy and human patients with TLE, cystatin C expression was increased in glial cells in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, being most prominent in cases with granule cell dispersion. In patients with TLE, high cystatin C expression associated with greater numbers of polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule-positive newborn cells in the molecular layer, although the overall number was decreased, indicating that the newborn cells migrate to abnormal locations in the epileptic dentate gyrus. These data thus demonstrate that cystatin C expression is altered during the chronic phase of epilepsy and suggest that cystatin C plays a role in network reorganization in the epileptic dentate gyrus, especially in granule cell dispersion and guidance of migrating newborn granule cells."
"A large body of clinical and experimental data indicate that complement activation is an important mechanism for neuronal and glial injury in Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndromes. Inhibition of complement activation therefore might be expected to limit the progression of the disease. Using in vitro and in vivo models of the Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome variant, Miller Fisher syndrome, we have shown previously that anti-GQ1b ganglioside antibodies target the presynaptic motor nerve terminal axon and surrounding perisynaptic Schwann cells, thereby mediating destructive injury through deposition of membrane attack complex. Here, we have used this model to investigate the effects of a novel therapeutic inhibitor of complement activation, APT070 (Mirococept), both in vitro and in vivo. In these models, APT070 completely prevents membrane attack complex formation, and thereby has a major neuroprotective effect at the nerve terminal, as assessed by immunohistology of perisynaptic Schwann cell and axonal integrity. These data provide a rationale for considering clinical trials of APT070 in Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome, its variant forms, and other complement dependent neuromuscular disorders."
"Perinatal asphyxia can result in neuronal injury with long-term neurological and behavioral consequences. Although hypothermia may provide some modest benefit, the intervention itself can produce adverse consequences. We have investigated whether xenon, an antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of the glutamate receptor, can enhance the neuroprotection provided by mild hypothermia. Cultured neurons injured by oxygen-glucose deprivation were protected by combinations of interventions of xenon and hypothermia that, when administered alone, were not efficacious. A combination of xenon and hypothermia administered 4 hours after hypoxic-ischemic injury in neonatal rats provided synergistic neuroprotection assessed by morphological criteria, by hemispheric weight, and by functional neurological studies up to 30 days after the injury. The protective mechanism of the combination, in both in vitro and in vivo models, involved an antiapoptotic action. If applied to humans, these data suggest that low (subanesthetic) concentrations of xenon in combination with mild hypothermia may provide a safe and effective therapy for perinatal asphyxia."
"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease caused by dysfunction of the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene. Human SMN gene is present in duplicated copies: SMN1 and SMN2. More than 95% of patients with SMA lack a functional SMN1 but retain at least one copy of SMN2. Unlike SMN1, SMN2 is primarily transcribed into truncated messenger RNA and produces low levels of SMN protein. We tested a therapeutic strategy by treating cultured lymphocytes from patients with SMA with hydroxyurea to modify SMN2 gene expression and to increase the production of SMN protein. Twenty lymphoblastoid cell lines (15 SMA and 5 control lines) were treated with hydroxyurea at 5 concentrations (0.5, 5, 50, 500, and 5,000 microg/ml) and 3 time points (24, 48, and 72 hours). SMN2 gene copy numbers were determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Hydroxyurea treatment resulted in a time-related and dose-dependent increase in the ratio of full-length to truncated SMN messenger RNA. SMN protein levels and intranuclear gems also were significantly increased in these hydroxyurea-treated cells. The SMN2 gene copy number correlated inversely with the SMA phenotypic severity. This study provides the first evidence for a therapeutic indication of hydroxyurea in SMA."
"Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) promotes the survival, growth, and regeneration of dopamine neurons in the midbrain that degenerate in Parkinson's disease. However, translating successful animal studies into effective clinical therapy for Parkinson's disease has proved difficult. In this article, using pulsed infusion for convection-enhanced delivery of GDNF, we have analyzed two variables hypothesized to be important for achieving efficacy: dose and GDNF distribution in the target tissue. Motor functions were significantly improved in rhesus monkeys with unilateral 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced parkinsonism that received midbrain infusion of GDNF for 10 weeks. The volume of distribution of GDNF in the five trophic factor recipients varied more than fivefold, from 59 to 325 mm3, and significantly correlated with motor function improvements. Significant increases were evident in the number of midbrain dopamine neurons immunopositive for tyrosine hydroxylase in both the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. Based on neurochemical and quantitative morphological measures, GDNF administration promoted recovery of both the nigrostriatal and ventral tegmental area-nucleus accumbens dopaminergic pathways without producing evident side effects. Increasing the dose threefold did not increase efficacy, suggesting that after achieving a critical threshold, GDNF tissue distribution is more important than dose for trophic stimulation of dopamine neurons."
"Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is a major cause of primary lactic acidosis and neurological dysfunction in infancy and early childhood. Most cases are caused by mutations in the X-linked gene for the E1alpha subunit of the complex. Mutations in DLAT, the gene encoding dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, the E2 core component of the complex, have not been described previously. We report two unrelated patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency caused by defects in the E2 subunit. Both patients are less severely affected than typical patients with E1alpha mutations and both have survived well into childhood. Episodic dystonia was the major neurological manifestation, with other more common features of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, such as hypotonia and ataxia, being less prominent. The patients had neuroradiological evidence of discrete lesions restricted to the globus pallidus, and both are homozygous for different mutations in the DLAT gene. The clinical presentation and neuroradiological findings are not typical of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency and extend the clinical and mutational spectrum of this condition."
"The pathomechanism of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) in the central nervous system is insufficiently understood. The aims of this study were to identify differentially regulated genes in the frontal cortex of sCJD and to profile the gene expression patterns in sCJD by using Affymetrix HGU133A microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The microarray data were generated by dChip and analyzed by Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) software. A comparison between control and sCJD samples identified 79 upregulated and 275 downregulated genes, which showed at least 1.5- and 2-fold changes, respectively, in sCJD frontal cortex, with an estimated false discovery rate of 5% or less. The major alterations in sCJD brains included upregulation of the genes encoding immune and stress-response factors and elements involved in cell death and cell cycle, as well as prominent downregulation of genes encoding synaptic proteins. A comparison of the molecular subtypes of sCJD showed various expression patterns associated with particular subtypes. The range of the upregulated genes and the degree of the increased expression appeared to be correlated with the degree of the neuropathological alterations in particular subtypes. Conspicuously, sCJD brains showed a great similarity with ageing human brains, both in the global expression patterns and in the identified differentially expressed genes."
"Mice that overexpress the human Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase-1 mutant G93A develop a delayed and progressive motor neuron disease similar to human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Most current studies of therapeutics in these mice to date have involved administration of agents long before onset of symptoms, which cannot currently be accomplished in human ALS patients. We examined the effects of the manganese porphyrin AEOL 10150 (manganese [III] tetrakis[N-N'-diethylimidazolium-2-yl]porphyrin) given at symptom onset and found, in three separate studies, that it extended the survival after onset up to 3.0-fold. Immunohistochemical analysis of spinal cord for SMI-32, an abundant protein in motor neurons, indicated better preservation of motor neuron architecture, less astrogliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein), and markedly less nitrotyrosine and malondialdehyde in porphyrin-treated spinal cords relative to vehicle-treated mice. These results show that the catalytic antioxidant AEOL 10150 provides a pronounced therapeutic benefit with onset administration and is, therefore, a promising agent for the treatment of ALS."
"Medical measures that bear no known danger for the adult brain may trigger active neuronal death in the developing brain. Pharmacological blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate or activation of GABA(A) receptors, blockade of voltage-dependent sodium channels, and oxygen induce widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration during the period of rapid brain growth in rodents. Because such measures are often necessary in critically ill infants and toddlers, search for adjunctive neuroprotective strategies is warranted. We report that 17beta-estradiol ameliorates neurotoxicity of drugs that block N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, activate GABA(A) receptors, or block voltage-gated sodium channels and reduces neurotoxicity of oxygen in the infant rat brain. This neuroprotective effect is reversed by tamoxifen and cannot be reproduced by 17alpha-estradiol. 17Beta-estradiol did not affect GABA(A) or N-methyl-D-aspartate currents in hippocampal neuronal cultures, indicating that direct modulation of neurotransmitter receptor/channel properties by this compound cannot explain neuroprotective effect. 17beta-Estradiol did, however, increase levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and AKT, suggesting that activation of these prosurvival proteins may represent one mechanism for its neuroprotective action. 17Beta-estradiol and related compounds may be neuroprotective agents suitable for use in critically ill infants and toddlers. Its supplementation may particularly help to improve neurocognitive outcome in preterm infants who are prematurely deprived of maternal estrogen."
"Several approaches have been used in an effort to identify proteins that interact with beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). However, few studies have addressed the identification of proteins associated with APP in brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer's disease. We report the results of a pilot proteomic study performed on complexes immunoprecipitated with APP in brain samples of patients with Alzheimer's disease and normal control subjects. The 21 proteins identified could be grouped into five functional classes: molecular chaperones, cytoskeletal and structural proteins, proteins involved in trafficking, adaptors, and enzymes. Among the proteins identified, six had been reported previously as direct, indirect, or genetically inferred APP interactors. The other 15 proteins immunoprecipitated with APP were novel potential partners. We confirmed the APP interaction by Western blotting and coimmunolocalization in brain tissues, for 5 of the 21 interactors. In agreement with previous studies, our results are compatible with an involvement of APP in axonal transport and vesicular trafficking, and with a potential association of APP with cellular protein folding/protein degradation systems."
"The 8993T--&gt;C mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been described previously to be associated with infantile- or childhood-onset phenotypes, ranging from Leigh's syndrome to neurogenic weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa syndrome. We report a kindred with adult-onset slowly progressive ataxia and polyneuropathy and with the heteroplasmic 8993T--&gt;C mutation. Our findings suggest that the 8993T--&gt;C mtDNA mutation should be considered in the differential diagnosis of nondominant adult-onset ataxia and axonal neuropathy."
"Although the prevalence of seizures in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) is 10 times that of the general population, there are few prospectively collected data on mechanism. With transcranial Doppler and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography, we evaluated 76 patients with sickle cell disease, 29 asymptomatic and 47 with neurological complications (seizures, stroke, transient ischemic attack, learning difficulty, headaches, or abnormal transcranial Doppler), who also underwent bolus-tracking perfusion MRI. The six patients with recent seizures also had electroencephalography. Group comparisons (seizure, nonseizure, and asymptomatic) indicated that abnormal transcranial Doppler was more common in the seizure (4/6; 67%) and nonseizure (26/41; 63%) groups than in the asymptomatic (10/29; 34%) group (chi2; p = 0.045), but abnormal structural MRI (chi2; p = 0.7) or magnetic resonance angiography (chi2; p = 0.2) were not. Relative decreased cerebral perfusion was found in all seizure patients and in 16 of 32 of the remaining patients with successful perfusion MRI (p = 0.03). In the seizure patients, the perfusion abnormalities in five were ipsilateral to electroencephalographic abnormalities; one had normal electroencephalogram results. These findings suggest that vasculopathy and focal hypoperfusion may be factors in the development of sickle cell disease-associated seizures."
"Some infants with perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAS) experience development of cerebral palsy (CP), epilepsy, and cognitive impairment, whereas others have a normal outcome. Previous prognostic studies rarely have included all diagnosed cases of PAS within a population. Among 199,176 infants born within Kaiser Permanente from 1997 to 2002, we electronically identified head imaging reports and physician diagnoses suggesting stroke. The diagnosis of PAS was confirmed by review of brain imaging and medical records. Presentation of PAS was considered delayed if symptoms were only noted after 28 days. Outcomes were determined by chart review. Of 40 infants with PAS, 36 were observed over 12 months. Abnormal outcomes included CP (58%), epilepsy (39%), language delay (25%), and behavioral abnormalities (22%). A delayed presentation was associated with increased risk for CP (relative risk [RR], 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-4.2). Radiological predictors of CP included large stroke size (RR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2-3.2) and injury to Broca's area (RR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3-5.0), internal capsule (RR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.4), Wernicke's area (RR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.8), or basal ganglia (RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.3). Among infants with PAS, specific radiological findings and a lack of symptoms in the newborn period are associated with increased risk for CP."
"The 12/15 lipoxygenase (12/15LOX) enzyme is increased in pathologically affected frontal and temporal regions of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains compared with controls. Herein, we measured 12(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HETE levels, products of 12/15LOX, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of normal individuals, subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Compared with controls, there was a significant increase of both metabolites in CSF from AD and MCI, which correlated with lipid peroxidation and tau protein levels. These results suggest that the activation of this enzyme occurs early in the course of AD, before the onset of overt dementia, thereby implicating 12/15LOX-mediated lipid peroxidation in the pathogenesis of AD."
"D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria is a neurometabolic disorder with mild and severe phenotypes. Recently, we reported pathogenic mutations in the D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase gene as the cause of the severe phenotype of D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria in two patients. Here, we report two novel pathogenic mutations in this gene in one patient with a mild presentation and two asymptomatic siblings with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria from two unrelated consanguineous Palestinian families: a splice error (IVS4-2A--&gt;G) and a missense mutation (c.1315A--&gt;G;p.Asn439Asp). Overexpression of this mutant protein showed marked reduction of the enzyme activity."
"Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive disorder with no known cure. We report two-year postoperative positron emission tomography (PET) data from 7 HD patients who underwent intrastriatal fetal transplantation. Patients showed widespread reductions in glucose uptake with no significant change over 2 years. Dopamine receptor binding was significantly reduced in HD striatum. D1 binding did not change significantly following transplantation, but there was a significant loss of D2 binding. These findings may reflect loss of graft viability and/or disease progression. There was no significant relationship between changes in PET and clinical function. In summary, there was no benefit from transplantation."
"Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is a rare neurodegenerative disease with the greatest incidence occurring in patients between 60 and 70 years old. Younger patients may also be affected. In this study, we used all case material available from 52 patients with sCJD aged 50 years or younger at disease onset, who were identified between 1993 and 2003 in Germany. The objective of this study was to describe the psychiatric and neurological features of these young patients with emphasis on the different codon 129 genotypes and PrP types, and to compare them with elder patients with sCJD and patients with variant CJD. We also gave particular attention to electroencephalogram, magnetic resonance imaging, and 14-3-3 results, as well as to the neuropathological lesion profile. The clinical syndrome in young patients differs from elder patients with CJD with respect to clinical signs, disease duration, technical investigations, and neuropathological lesion profile. The psychiatric symptoms in young patients with sCJD are similar to the psychiatric symptoms expressed by patients with variant CJD; however, in contrast with the variant cases, young patients with sCJD experience development of prominent dementia early in the disease course."
"Surgical treatment of cryptogenic neocortical epilepsy is challenging. The aim of this study was to evaluate surgical outcomes and to identify possible prognostic factors including the results of various diagnostic tools. Eighty-nine patients with neocortical epilepsy with normal magnetic resonance imaging (35 patients with frontal lobe epilepsy, 31 with neocortical temporal lobe epilepsy, 11 with occipital lobe epilepsy, 11 with parietal lobe epilepsy, and 1 with multifocal epilepsy) underwent invasive study and focal surgical resection. Patients were observed for at least 2 years after surgery. The localizing values of interictal electroencephalogram (EEG), ictal scalp EEG, interictal 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and subtraction ictal single-photon emission computed tomography were evaluated. Seventy-one patients (80.0%) had a good surgical outcome (Engel class 1-3); 42 patients were seizure free. Diagnostic sensitivities of interictal EEG, ictal scalp EEG, FDG-PET, and subtraction ictal single-photon emission computed tomography were 37.1%, 70.8%, 44.3%, and 41.1%, respectively. Localization by FDG-PET and interictal EEG was correlated with a seizure-free outcome. The localizing value of FDG-PET was greatest in neocortical temporal lobe epilepsy. The focalization of ictal onset and also ictal onset frequency in invasive studies were not related to surgical outcome. Concordance with two or more presurgical evaluations was significantly related to a seizure-free outcome."
"The objective of this study was to investigate clinical, biochemical, and genetic features in 7 probands (a total of 11 patients) with nicotine-amide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase (complex I) deficiency. We screened the mitochondrial DNA for mutations and found pathogenic mutations in complex I genes (mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit (MTND) genes) in three probands. The 10191T&gt;C mutation in MTND3 and the 14487T&gt;C mutation in MTND6 were present in two probands with Leigh's-like and Leigh's syndrome, respectively. Four siblings with a syndrome consisting of encephalomyopathy with hearing impairment, optic nerve atrophy, and cardiac involvement had the 11778G&gt;A mutation in MTND4, previously associated with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. These findings demonstrate that mutations in MTND genes are relatively frequent in patients with complex I deficiency. Biochemical measurements of respiratory chain function in muscle mitochondria showed that all patients had a moderate decrease of the mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate production rate. Interestingly, the complex I deficiency caused secondary metabolic alterations with decreased oxaloacetate-induced inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (complex II) and excretion of Krebs cycle intermediates in the urine. Our results thus suggest that altered regulation of metabolism may play an important role in the pathogenesis of complex I deficiency."
"Mutations in AbetaPP cause deposition of Abeta amyloid fibrils in brain parenchyma and cerebral vessels, resulting in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and/or cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). We report a novel mutation (L705V) within the Abeta sequence of AbetaPP in a family with autosomal dominant, recurrent intracerebral hemorrhages. Pathological examination disclosed severe CAA, without parenchymal amyloid plaques or neurofibrillary tangles. This variant highlights the vascular tropism of mutated Abeta, resulting in CAA instead of the pathological hallmarks of AD."
"In patients with Parkinson's disease, hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra using transcranial ultrasound has been related to increased tissue concentrations of iron. Recently, deficient iron transport mechanisms in substantia nigra neurons have been described in postmortem tissue of patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS). This study was performed to study substantia nigra echogenicity in RLS patients compared with normal control subjects and Parkinson's disease patients. RLS patients had significantly reduced midbrain areas of hyperechogenicity compared with control subjects, and even more markedly reduced hyperechogenicity compared with Parkinson's disease patients. These findings lend further support to nigral iron deficiency as a pathogenetic factor in RLS."
"Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter syndrome (childhood ataxia with central nervous system hypomyelination/vanishing white matter disease) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the occurrence of acute episodes of deterioration after minor head trauma or infection, and symmetrical demyelination on magnetic resonance with cavitation aspects. Mutations in each of the five subunits of eIF2B have been identified. We report in an affected man and his mother an adult-onset form of childhood ataxia with central nervous system hypomyelination/vanishing white matter disease-like disorder with no mutations in the EIF2B genes and normal guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B activity, suggesting a new dominant inheritance of this syndrome that may involve other genes."
"The vestibular nerves are known to influence neuronal circuits in the medullary cardiovascular areas and, through the cerebellar vermis, the basal ganglia and the limbic system. By means of noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), it might be possible to ameliorate blunted responsiveness of degenerated neuronal circuits of patients with multi system atrophy or Parkinson's disease, or both. We evaluated the effect of 24-hour noisy GVS on long-term heart rate dynamics in 7 patients with multi system atrophy and on daytime trunk activity dynamics in 12 patients with either levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease or levodopa-unresponsive parkinsonism. Six of the latter patients were also examined for cognitive performance by means of a continuous performance test. Short-range or high-frequency fluctuations of heart rate were significantly increased by the noisy GVS compared with sham stimulation, suggestive of improved autonomic, especially parasympathetic, responsiveness. Long-range antipersistency of trunk activity patterns probed by an autocorrelation measure was significantly increased by the noisy GVS, suggestive of quickening of bradykinesic rest-to-active transitions. The mean reaction time of the continuous performance test was also significantly decreased by the noisy GVS, without significant changes in either the omission or commission error ratios, which is suggestive of improved motor execution during the cognitive task. In conclusion, the noisy GVS is effective in boosting the neurodegenerative brains of patients with multi system atrophy or Parkinson's disease, or both, including those unresponsive to standard levodopa therapy; it is also effective in improving these patients' autonomic and motor responsiveness."
"Axonal loss is thought to be a likely cause of persistent disability after a multiple sclerosis relapse; therefore, noninvasive in vivo markers specific for axonal loss are needed. We used optic neuritis as a model of multiple sclerosis relapse to quantify axonal loss of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and secondary retinal ganglion cell loss in the macula with optical coherence tomography. We studied 25 patients who had a previous single episode of optic neuritis with a recruitment bias to those with incomplete recovery and 15 control subjects. Optical coherence tomography measurement of RNFL thickness and macular volume, quantitative visual testing, and electrophysiological examination were performed. There were highly significant reductions (p &lt; 0.001) of RNFL thickness and macular volume in affected patient eyes compared with control eyes and clinically unaffected fellow eyes. There were significant relationships among RNFL thickness and visual acuity, visual field, color vision, and visual-evoked potential amplitude. This study has demonstrated functionally relevant changes indicative of axonal loss and retinal ganglion cell loss in the RNFL and macula, respectively, after optic neuritis. This noninvasive RNFL imaging technique could be used in trials of experimental treatments that aim to protect optic nerves from axonal loss."
"Myasthenia gravis (MG) in thymoma patients depends critically on intratumorous generation and export of mature autoreactive CD4+ T cells. Why non-MG thymomas fail to produce CD4+ T cells is unknown. We studied three single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4(CTLA4) gene in thymoma patients, nonthymoma early-onset MG patients, and control subjects. Surprisingly, the CTLA4high genotype +49A/A, which is protective against several autoimmune diseases, exerted a prominent predisposing effect to paraneoplastic MG in thymoma patients. The unusual disease association with a CTLA4high genotype implies a unique pathogenesis of paraneoplastic MG, with high CTLA4 levels possibly supporting the nontolerogenic selection of CD4+ T cells in MG-associated thymomas."
"The hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) is a rare developmental malformation often characterized by gelastic seizures, which are usually refractory to medical therapy. The mechanisms of epileptogenesis operative in this subcortical lesion are unknown. In this study, we used standard patch-clamp electrophysiological techniques combined with histochemical approaches to study individual cells from human HH tissue immediately after surgical resection. More than 90% of dissociated HH cells were small (6-9 microm soma) and exhibited immunoreactivity to the neuronal marker NeuN, and to glutamic acid decarboxylase, but not to glial fibrillary acidic protein. Under current-clamp, whole-cell recordings in single dissociated cells or in intact HH slices demonstrated typical neuronal responses to depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current injection. In some cases, HH cells exhibited a ""sag-like"" membrane potential change during membrane hyperpolarization. Interestingly, most HH cells exhibited robust, spontaneous ""pacemaker-like"" action potential firing. Under voltage-clamp, dissociated HH cells exhibited functional tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive Na(+) and tetraethylammonium-sensitive K(+) currents. Both GABA and glutamate evoked whole-cell currents, with GABA exhibiting a peak current amplitude 10-fold greater than glutamate. These findings suggest that human HH tissues, associated with gelastic seizures, contained predominantly small GABAergic inhibitory neurons that exhibited intrinsic ""pacemaker-like"" behavior."
"A postherpetic-neuralgia patient abruptly discontinued pregabalin. Thirty hours later, unexplained nausea, headache, and ataxia developed, progressing to delirium 8 days later. Magnetic resonance imaging indicated T2-hyperintense lesions of her splenium. Similar magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities, interpreted as focal vasogenic edema, develop in some epileptic patients after rapid anticonvulsant withdrawal. Patients with high-altitude cerebral edema have similar splenial-predominant magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities that accompany these same neurological symptoms. This case is the first to associate anticonvulsant-withdrawal splenial abnormalities with neurological symptoms, with gabapentin-type anticonvulsants, and is among the first in nonepileptic patients, suggesting that sudden anticonvulsant withdrawal alone, unaccompanied by seizures, can initiate symptomatic focal brain edema. The similarity of this syndrome to high-altitude cerebral edema suggests a possible common pathophysiology and offers potential therapies."
"Risk for ischemic stroke is mediated by both environmental and genetic factors. Although several environmental exposures have been implicated, relatively little is known about the genetic basis of predisposition to this disease. Recent studies in Iceland identified risk polymorphisms in two putative candidate genes for ischemic stroke: phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) and 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (ALOX5AP). A collection of North American sibling pairs concordant for ischemic stroke and two cohorts of prospectively ascertained North American ischemic stroke cases and control subjects were used for evaluation of PDE4D and ALOX5AP. Although no evidence supported linkage of ischemic stroke with either of the two candidate genes, single-nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypic associations were observed between PDE4D and ischemic stroke. There was no evidence of association between variants of ALOX5AP and ischemic stroke. These data suggest that common variants in PDE4D may contribute to the genetic risk for ischemic stroke in multiple populations."
"In this study, we characterized five Ullrich scleroatonic muscular dystrophy patients (two Italians, one Belgian, and two Turks) with a clinical phenotype showing different degrees of severity, all carrying mutations localized in COL6A1. We sequenced the three entire COL6 complementary DNA. Three of five patients have recessive mutations: two patients (P1and P3) have homozygous single-nucleotide deletions, one in exon 9 and one in exon 22; one patient (P2) has a homozygous single-nucleotide substitution leading to a premature termination codon in exon 31. The nonsense mutation of P2 also causes a partial skipping of exon 31 with the formation of a premature termination codon in exon 32 in 15% of the total COL6A1 messenger RNA. The remaining two patients carry a heterozygous glycine substitution in exons 9 and 10 inside the triple-helix region; both are dominant mutations because the missense mutations are absent in the DNA of their respective parents. As for the three homozygous recessive mutations, the apparently healthy consanguineous parents all carry a heterozygous mutated allele. Here, for the first time, we report a genotype-phenotype correlation demonstrating that heterozygous glycine substitutions in the triple-helix domain of COL6A1 are dominant and responsible for a milder Ullrich scleroatonic muscular dystrophy phenotype, and that recessive mutations in COL6A1 correlate with more severe clinical and biochemical Ullrich scleroatonic muscular dystrophy phenotypes."
"We report the clinical, genetic, and neuropathological findings of a seven generation-spanning pedigree with 196 individuals, 25 of whom had levodopa-responsive parkinsonism. Genetic analyses indicated Parkin mutations in 77 subjects. Among the 25 patients, 5 carried compound heterozygous mutations and met criteria for definite Parkinson's disease (PD) according to UK PD Society Brain Bank guidelines; 8 subjects carried only a heterozygous Parkin mutation. The mutational status of five deceased patients was unknown, and seven PD patients had no Parkin mutation. Survival analyses showed a significant difference in the age-at-onset distribution between patients with compound heterozygous mutations and the groups of heterozygous carriers and subjects without detectable Parkin mutations. Autopsy of a 73-year-old patient, who carried two mutant Parkin alleles (delExon7 + del1072T), showed PD-type cell loss, reactive gliosis, and alpha-synuclein-positive Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus. Surviving neurons were reactive with antibodies to the N terminus of Parkin but not the In-Between-RING (""IBR"") domain, which had been deleted by both mutations. This large Parkin pedigree represents a unique opportunity to prospectively study the role of heterozygous Parkin mutations as a PD risk factor, to identify additional contributors to the expression of late-onset PD in heterozygous carriers, and to reexamine the role of Parkin in inclusion formation."
"In aphasia due to stroke, language-related activity shifts not only to undamaged cortex within the dominant hemisphere but also toward right-sided areas homotopical to the left-sided lesion. We examined whether a rightward shift takes place in primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Nineteen PPA patients participated, 19 healthy subjects and 14 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who served as controls. Subjects underwent neuropsychological assessment, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a functional MRI with a factorial design: words versus pictures and associative-semantic versus visuoperceptual task. Measures of neuropsychological performance were entered as regressors into a multiple linear regression analysis, with response amplitude during the associative-semantic versus control conditions as outcome variable. Language competence correlated negatively with responses in the right anterior temporal cortex and positively with volume and responses in the left-sided homotope. In normal subjects, anterior temporal activation was more extensive to the left than the right (laterality index [LI], +0.64; standard error [SE], 0.11). Laterality was inverted in PPA with word comprehension deficit (LI, - 0.34; SE, 0.19), with an intermediate pattern in PPA without comprehension deficit (LI, +0.23; SE, 0.14). The rightward laterality shift previously reported in aphasic stroke extends to PPA, in particular, when comprehension is deficient."
"We have updated the clinical description of a large Scottish pedigree, in which patients were affected by spastic paraplegia complicated by hearing impairment and persistent vomiting due to hiatal hernia inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Using a genome-wide mapping approach, we identified a novel locus (SPG29) for this form of hereditary spastic paraplegia on chromosome 1p31.1-21.1 and narrowed it to 22.3cM between markers D1S2889 and D1S248. Sequencing of one candidate gene in the region (sorting nexin 7, SNX7), involved in several stages of intracellular trafficking and protein transport, showed no disease-causing mutations."
"The main objective of this study was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of five alternative diagnostic strategies for identification of severe carotid stenosis in recently symptomatic patients. A decision-analytical model with Markov transition states was constructed. Data sources included a prospective study involving 167 patients who had screening Doppler ultrasound (DUS), confirmatory contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CEMRA) and confirmatory digital subtraction angiography (DSA), individual patient data from the European Carotid Surgery Trial and other published clinical and cost data. A ""selective"" strategy, whereby all patients receive DUS and CEMRA (only proceeding to DSA if the CEMRA is positive and the DUS is negative), was most cost-effective. This was both the cheapest imaging and treatment strategy (35,205 dollars per patient) and yielded 6.1590 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), higher than three alternative imaging strategies. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that there was less than a 10% probability that imaging with either DUS or DSA alone are cost-effective at the conventional 50,000 dollars/QALY threshold. In conclusion, DSA is not cost-effective in the routine diagnostic workup of most patients. DUS, with additional imaging in the form of CEMRA, is recommended, with a strategy of ""CEMRA and selective DUS review"" being shown to be the optimal imaging strategy."
"Serum samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients immunized with Abeta42 (AN1792) were analyzed to determine the induced antibody properties including precise amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) epitopes and amyloid plaque-binding characteristics. The predominant response in these patients is independent of whether or not meningoencephalitis developed and is against the free amino terminus of Abeta. The immunostaining of amyloid plaques in brain tissue by patient sera is adsorbable by a linear Abeta1-8 peptide, demonstrating that the antibodies are directed predominantly to this epitope and not dependent on Abeta conformations or aggregates specific to plaques. Furthermore, the antibodies are not capable of binding amyloid precursor protein and would be predicted to be competent in facilitating clearance of amyloid plaques in AD brains."
"Alterations in cholesterol homeostasis influence the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Apolipoprotein A1 is the major apolipoprotein of the high-density lipoprotein and is involved in reverse cholesterol transport. Variation in the apolipoprotein A1 gene (APOA1) might influence the function of the protein, and thus brain cholesterol metabolism, leading to an increased risk for AD. Two polymorphisms of APOA1, a G/A substitution at position -75bp and a C/T and G/A base substitution at position +83bp or +84bp, or both, in the APOA1 promoter, have been described. We investigated the effect of these polymorphisms on the risk for AD in 427 AD patients and 500 healthy control subjects of German and English descent. The A allele of the APOA1 -75bp G/A polymorphism was associated with an increased risk for AD in subjects with an age at onset of 66 years or younger. Further data analysis indicated that AD patients homozygous for the A allele at position -75bp presented with disease onset 8 years earlier than carriers of at least one G allele. No influence of the +83/84bp polymorphism on the risk for AD was observed. These results suggest that variants of APOA1 might influence the onset and the risk for AD."
"Mutations in myosin heavy chain (MyHC) genes recently have been shown to be associated with various forms of congenital myopathies: myosin myopathies. The MyHC IIa E706K mutation is associated with congenital joint contractures, early-onset muscle weakness, and progressive course with moderate to severe muscle weakness later in life. To study the pathogenicity of this MyHC mutation, we investigated the effect of the corresponding mutation (E710K) in the major MyHC isoform (MyHC B) of the body wall muscle of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Worms with null mutations in the MyHC B gene (unc-54) are severely paralyzed and depleted of thick filaments in the body wall muscle sarcomeres. unc-54 null mutants with extrachromosomal arrays of a gene construct including the entire wild-type unc-54 gene were partially rescued as determined by a motility assay and by morphological analysis of the body wall muscle. Analysis of unc-54 null mutants with extrachromosomal arrays of the unc-54 gene with the E710K mutation were severely paralyzed but showed formation of thick filaments in the body wall muscle. We conclude that the MyHC E706K (E710K in C. elegans) mutation is pathogenic and that the effect is primarily functional rather than structural because thick filaments are formed. The C. elegans model may be useful to study suspected pathogenic mutations in MyHC genes associated with human muscle diseases."
"A 78-year-old woman suffered a stroke inside a magnetic resonance scanner while being imaged because of a brief transient ischemic attack 2 hours earlier. Diffusion-weighted images obtained 11 minutes after stroke showed tissue injury not found on initial images. The data show early, abrupt diffusion changes in hypoperfused tissue, adding to our understanding of the progression of microstructural abnormalities in the hyperacute phase of stroke."
"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a common cause of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), as well as small asymptomatic hemorrhage in the elderly. We used gradient-echo MRI to analyze spatial distribution of 321 hemorrhages in 59 patients with probable CAA-related ICH. Hemorrhagic lesions were found preferentially in the temporal (ratio of actual to expected hemorrhages = 1.37) and occipital lobes (ratio = 1.45, p &lt; 0.0001). Within individuals, hemorrhages tended to cluster, regardless of lobe (p &lt; 0.0001). Among subjects followed prospectively for recurrence, clustering of new symptomatic and asymptomatic hemorrhages was observed. These data suggest that regional differences within the brain play a role in the development of CAA-related hemorrhage."
"Two independent studies have described bilateral temporal hypoperfusion in autistic children. Temporal regions are implicated in social perception, language, and ""theory-of-mind,"" abilities that are impaired in autism. We investigated a putative relationship between cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measured at rest and clinical profile of 45 autistic children (Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised [ADI-R] scores). A whole-brain covariance analysis was performed. Significant negative correlation was observed between rCBF and ADI-R score in the left superior temporal gyrus. The more severe the autistic syndrome, the more rCBF is low in this region, suggesting that left superior temporal hypoperfusion is related to autistic behavior severity."
"Inheritance patterns in twins and multiplex families led us to hypothesize that two loci were segregating in subjects with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), one predisposing to generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and a second to myoclonic seizures. We tested this hypothesis by performing genome-wide scan of a large family (Family 01) and used the results to guide analyses of additional families. A locus was identified in Family 01 that was linked to GTCS (10q25-q26). Model-based multipoint analysis of the 10q25-q26 locus showed a logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 2.85; similar results were obtained with model-free analyses (maximum nonparametric linkage [NPL] of 2.71; p = 0.0019). Analyses of the 10q25-q26 locus in 10 additional families assuming heterogeneity revealed evidence for linkage in four families; model-based and model-free analyses showed a heterogeneity LOD (HLOD) of 2.01 (alpha = 0.41) and maximum NPL of 2.56 (p = 0.0027), respectively, when all subjects with GTCS were designated to be affected. Combined analyses of all 11 families showed an HLOD of 4.04 (alpha = 0.51) and maximum NPL score of 4.20 (p = 0.000065). Fine mapping of the locus defined an interval of 4.45Mb. These findings identify a novel locus for GTCS on 10q25-q26 and support the idea that distinct loci underlie distinct seizure types within an epilepsy syndrome such as JME."
"Previous studies have used paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to show that short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) is reduced in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). This study examined whether reduced SICI in PD is caused by an increase in the threshold of inhibitory pathways or a reduction in the threshold of excitatory pathways. Motor-evoked potentials were recorded from a hand muscle in 12 patients with PD (7 patients were tested off and on antiparkinsonian medications) and 12 control subjects. SICI was tested at seven conditioning stimulus intensities (CSIs; 40-100% of resting motor threshold) and at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 2, 3, and 4 milliseconds. No differences were found between groups in resting or active motor threshold, SICI threshold, or the extent of SICI at CSIs at or below 80% of resting motor threshold. Significant differences between groups were observed at CSIs of 90% and 100% with an ISI of 3 milliseconds. Antiparkinsonian medication had no effect on SICI. These findings show that the low threshold inhibitory pathways mediating SICI are normal in PD. The suppression of SICI observed at higher CSIs suggests that the threshold of intracortical facilitatory pathways is decreased in PD."
"Defective elimination of autoreactive cells is thought to play a role in the development of autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS). We examined the activation of the ATM-CHK2-p53 pathway in MS patients after subjecting their peripheral blood mononuclear cells to gamma-irradiation. We found that peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a subset of MS patients show resistance to cell death induced by irradiation. This defect is due to impaired constitutive expression and activation of ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), resulting in impaired stabilization of p53. We predict that these fundamental defects likely alter the regulation of the immune population of cells in MS and may contribute to the development or progression of the disease."
"We report a 49-year-old woman with a history of progressive gait disturbance, white matter disease, and cerebrospinal fluid immunoglobulin abnormalities who met criteria for primary progressive multiple sclerosis and whose son died at age 10 years of an unknown congenital neurodevelopmental disorder. Sequencing of the proteolipid protein 1 gene showed a novel mutation, Leu30Arg (c.89TG), in the mother and son. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease is the cause of death in the son and explains the mother's adult-onset neurological disorder. This case goes against dogma that mothers of severely affected sons are asymptomatic as adults and expands the differential diagnosis of primary progressive multiple sclerosis to include proteolipid protein 1 gene mutations."
"A serine protease activated protein C has been shown to be a powerful neuroprotectant in stressed neurons and in hypoxic brain endothelium. In a clinically relevant model of embolic stroke in rodents, we now show that administration of activated protein C alone or in combination with tissue plasminogen activator, or both, 4 hours after embolic stroke improves the functional outcome and reduces brain infarction within 7 days of stroke. In contrast, tissue plasminogen activator alone was not protective. Thus, activated protein C may be useful as a new stand-alone therapy for clinical stroke and to extend the time window of thrombolytic therapy."
"Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging and patient studies indicate cerebellar participation in verbal working memory. In particular, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging showed superior cerebellar activation during the initial encoding phase of the Sternberg task. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test whether disruption of the right superior cerebellum (hemispheric lobule VI/Crus I) impairs verbal working memory performance. Single-pulse TMS was administered immediately after letter presentation during the encoding phase on half the trials. Sham TMS and a Motor Control task were included to test for general distraction and nonmemory-related motor effects. Results showed no effects of TMS on accuracy, but reaction times (RTs) on correct trials were significantly increased on TMS relative to non-TMS trials for the Verbal Working Memory and Motor Control tasks. Additional analyses showed that the increased RT was significantly greater for Verbal Working Memory than for the motor task, suggesting that the effect on working memory was not caused by interference with finger responses. Sham TMS did not affect RTs, indicating that the potentially distracting effects of the postencoding click did not contribute to the increase in RT. The observed effects from cerebellar disruption are consistent with proposed cerebrocerebellar involvement in verbal working memory."
"Congenital amusia is a lifelong disability that prevents afflicted individuals from enjoying music as ordinary people do. The deficit is limited to music and cannot be explained by prior brain lesion, hearing loss, or any cognitive or socio-affective disturbance. Recent behavioral results suggest that this disorder is critically dependent on fine-grained pitch discrimination. Here, we present novel electrophysiological evidence that this disorder can be traced down to a right-lateralized N2-P3 response elicited by pitch changes. This abnormal brain response begins as early as 200 milliseconds after tone onset and may serve as a marker of an anomaly in music acquisition."
"Deletion of the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p) is considered a favorable prognostic factor in glial tumors. High-density array-comparative genomic hybridization analysis of 108 gliomas shows two distinct types of 1p deletions. Complete hemizygous losses of 1p, which are tightly associated with 19q loss and oligodendroglial phenotype, and partial 1p deletions mainly observed in astrocytic tumors and not associated with 19q loss. Whereas the first type predicts longer overall and progression-free survival (p &lt; 0.0001), the second type has a pejorative prognostic value. Complete 1p-arm evaluation therefore is required to appreciate the real clinical significance of 1p loss in gliomas."
"The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) has been widely adopted. Failure to assess the verbal score in intubated patients and the inability to test brainstem reflexes are shortcomings. We devised a new coma score, the FOUR (Full Outline of UnResponsiveness) score. It consists of four components (eye, motor, brainstem, and respiration), and each component has a maximal score of 4. We prospectively studied the FOUR score in 120 intensive care unit patients and compared it with the GCS score using neuroscience nurses, neurology residents, and neurointensivists. We found that the interrater reliability was excellent with the FOUR score (kappa(w) = 0.82) and good to excellent for physician rater pairs. The agreement among raters was similar with the GCS (kappa(w) = 0.82). Patients with the lowest GCS score could be further distinguished using the FOUR score. We conclude that the agreement among raters was good to excellent. The FOUR score provides greater neurological detail than the GCS, recognizes a locked-in syndrome, and is superior to the GCS due to the availability of brainstem reflexes, breathing patterns, and the ability to recognize different stages of herniation. The probability of in-hospital mortality was higher for the lowest total FOUR score when compared with the lowest total GCS score."
"We report four young women who developed acute psychiatric symptoms, seizures, memory deficits, decreased level of consciousness, and central hypoventilation associated with ovarian teratoma (OT) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory abnormalities. Three patients recovered with treatment of the tumor or immunosuppression and one died of the disorder. Five other OT patients with a similar syndrome and response to treatment have been reported. Our patients' serum or CSF showed immunolabeling of antigens that were expressed at the cytoplasmic membrane of hippocampal neurons and processes and readily accessed by antibodies in live neurons. Immunoprobing of a hippocampal-expression library resulted in the isolation of EFA6A, a protein that interacts with a member of the two-pore-domain potassium channel family and is involved in the regulation of the dendritic development of hippocampal neurons. EFA6A-purified antibodies reproduced the hippocampal immunolabeling of all patients' antibodies and colocalized with them at the plasma membrane. These findings indicate that in a young woman with acute psychiatric symptoms, seizures, and central hypoventilation, a paraneoplastic immune-mediated syndrome should be considered. Recognition of this disorder is important because despite the severity of the symptoms, patients usually recover. The location and function of the isolated antigen suggest that the disorder is directly mediated by antibodies."
"Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding thymidine phosphorylase (TP). All MNGIE patients have had severe loss of TP function and prominent plasma accumulations of the TP substrates thymidine (dThd) and deoxyuridine (dUrd). Here, we report for the first time to our knowledge three MNGIE patients with later onset, milder phenotype, and less severe TP dysfunction, compared with typical MNGIE patients. This report demonstrates a direct relationship between the biochemical defects and clinical phenotypes in MNGIE and supports the notion that reduction of dThd and dUrd accumulation or TP replacement could be useful therapy for MNGIE."
"Human cerebral cortical polymicrogyria is a heterogeneous disorder, with only one known gene (GPR56) associated with an apparently distinctive phenotype, termed bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP). To define the range of abnormalities that could be caused by human GPR56 mutations and to establish diagnostic criteria for BFPP, we analyzed the GPR56 gene in a cohort of 29 patients with typical BFPP. We identified homozygous GPR56 mutations in all 29 patients with typical BFPP. The total of 11 GPR56 mutations found represented a variety of distinct founder mutations in various populations throughout the world. In addition, we analyzed five patients with BFPP who did not show GPR56 mutation and found that they define a clinically, radiographically, and genetically distinct syndrome that we termed BFPP2. Finally, we studied seven patients with a variety of other polymicrogyria syndromes including bilateral frontal polymicrogyria, bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria, and bilateral generalized polymicrogyria. No GPR56 mutation was found in these patients. This study provides a molecular confirmation of the BFPP phenotype and provides the wherewithal for diagnostic screening."
"Regular, evidence-based assignment of patients to etiologic stroke categories is essential to enable valid comparison among studies. We designed an algorithm (SSS-TOAST) that incorporated recent advances in stroke imaging and epidemiology to identify the most probable TOAST category in the presence of evidence for multiple mechanisms. Based on the weight of evidence, each TOAST subtype was subdivided into 3 subcategories as ""evident"", ""probable"", or ""possible"". Classification into the subcategories was determined via predefined specific clinical and imaging criteria. These criteria included published risks of ischemic stroke from various mechanisms and published reports of the strength of associations between clinical and imaging features and particular stroke mechanisms. Two neurologists independently assessed 50 consecutively admitted patients with acute ischemic stroke through reviews of abstracted data from medical records. The number of patients classified as ""undetermined-unclassified"" per the original TOAST system decreased from 38-40% to 4% using the SSS-TOAST system. The kappa value for inter-examiner reliability was 0.78 and 0.90 for the original TOAST and SSS-TOAST respectively. The SSS-TOAST system successfully classifies patients with acute ischemic stroke into determined etiologic categories without sacrificing reliability. The SSS-TOAST is a dynamic algorithm that can accommodate modifications as new epidemiological data accumulate and diagnostic techniques advance."
"Migraine is among the most common types of pain, but its mechanisms are poorly understood. A growing body of evidence points to a critical role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the pathophysiology of migraine headache. During migraine, CGRP is thought to be released from peripheral endings of perivascular meningeal nociceptors primary and to promote vasodilatation. A current hypothesis suggests that peripheral CGRP and its related meningeal vasodilatation results in activation and sensitization, leading to the generation of migraine headache. However, direct evidence supporting this idea is lacking. Here, using electrophysiological, extracellular, single-unit recording combined with laser-Doppler flowmetry measurements of dural blood flow (DBF), we examined whether CGRP and meningeal vasodilatation promote activation or sensitization of meningeal nociceptors. Changes in (DBF), ongoing discharge, and responsiveness to mechanical stimulation of the dura were studied after either topical administration or intravenous infusion of rat alpha-CGRP in anesthetized rats. Both topical and systemic administration of CGRP caused a significant increase in dural blood flow; however, neither method of CGRP administration resulted in activation or sensitization of meningeal nociceptors. The results of this study suggest that CGRP effects in the meninges, including meningeal vasodilatation, are not sufficient to activate or sensitize meningeal nociceptors."
"A critical role of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage has been hypothesized in both aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Much of the evidence has been correlative, but recent evidence has shown that the accumulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations accelerates normal aging, leads to oxidative damage to nuclear DNA, and impairs gene transcription. Furthermore, overexpression of the antioxidant enzyme catalase in mitochondria increases murine life span. There is strong evidence from genetics and transgenic mouse models that mitochondrial dysfunction results in neurodegeneration and may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and cerebellar degenerations. Therapeutic approaches targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage in these diseases therefore have great promise."
"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) progressively affects the facial, shoulder, and upper arm muscles and is associated with contractions of the polymorphic D4Z4 repeat array in 4q35. Recently, we demonstrated that FSHD alleles are hypomethylated at D4Z4. To study potential relationships between D4Z4 hypomethylation and both residual repeat size and clinical severity, we compared the clinical severity score with D4Z4 methylation in unrelated FSHD patients. Correcting the clinical severity score for age at examination improves the parameter to define clinical severity and provides further support for hypomethylation of FSHD alleles. However, a linear relationship between repeat size and clinical severity of the disease cannot be established. Interestingly, FSHD can be separated in two clinical severity classes: patients with residual repeat sizes of 10 to 20 kb are severely affected and show pronounced D4Z4 hypomethylation. In contrast, patients with repeat sizes of 20 to 31kb show large interindividual variation in clinical severity and D4Z4 hypomethylation. Because the majority of familial FSHD cases are represented in this interval and considering the overt variation in clinical severity in these familial cases, it thus is imperative to develop comprehensive allele-specific assays monitoring total D4Z4 methylation to investigate whether interindividual variation in D4Z4 methylation can be translated into a prognostic factor for clinical severity."
"In contrast with other systemic rheumatic diseases in childhood, no systematic studies exist that focus on possible long-term risks for central nervous system involvement in systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (SJRA). We investigated 31 children and adolescents with SJRA, aged 6 to 24 years (mean, 12.5 years; standard deviation, 4.3 years), with mean disease duration of 6.2 years (standard deviation, 3.5 years; range, 0.6-14 years) for their cognitive and fine motor abilities. We also examined 31 matched healthy control subjects. In addition, parents assessed social activities and social and emotional problems in their children. Patients and control subjects performed within normal limits of intelligence quotient, memory and learning, attention, and fine motor scores. Less social activities were reported for patients. Patients and control subjects, however, had normal social and emotional problem scores. SJRA, although a burdensome chronic disease, is not associated with cognitive impairment or increased social and emotional problems. Cognitive performance and social adjustment of young patients with SJRA are not affected by disease activity and duration."
"Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a heterogeneous group of neurological disorders. Point mutations in the gene encoding protein kinase Cgamma (PRKCG) are responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia 14 (SCA14). We screened for mutations in the PRKCG gene, in a large series of 284 ADCA index cases, mostly French (n=204) and German (n=48), in whom CAG repeat expansions in the known SCA genes were previously excluded. Six mutations were found that segregated with the disease and were not detected on 560 control chromosomes, including F643L (exon 18), already reported in another French kindred. Five new missense mutations were identified in exons 4 (C114Y/G123R/G123E), 10 (G360S) and 18 (V692G). All but one (V692G) were located in highly conserved regions of the regulatory or catalytic domains of the protein. All six SCA14 families were French and there was no evidence of reduced penetrance. The phenotype consisted in a very slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia with a mean age at onset of 33.5+/-14.2 years (range 15 to 60 years), occasionally associated with executive dysfunction, myoclonus, myorythmia, tremor or decreased vibration sense. SCA14 represented only 1.5% (7/454) of French ADCA families but none of the German families. It should, however, be considered in patients with slowly progressive ADCA, particularly when myoclonus and cognitive impairment are present."
"Multiple studies demonstrate that the brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD) contains extensive oxidative damage. Most of these studies used advanced-stage AD patients raising the question of whether oxidative damage is a late effect of neurodegeneration or precedes and contributes to the pathogenesis of AD. Here we describe F(2)-isoprostane (F(2)-IsoP) and F(4)-neuroprostane (F(4)-NP) levels in longitudinally followed, well documented autopsied normal control subjects and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and late-stage AD. Gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization/mass spectrometry was used to determine F(2)-IsoP and F(4)-NP levels. Significant increases in F(2)-IsoP levels were found in frontal, parietal and occipital lobes in MCI and late AD compared to controls but no significant differences were present between MCI and late AD. A significant increase in F(4)-NPs was present in parietal and occipital lobes in MCI compared to controls and a significant increase was present in these regions and hippocampus in late AD compared to controls. The only difference between MCI and late AD was significantly increased F(4)-NP in hippocampus in late AD. Our data indicate that lipid peroxidation is present in the brain of MCI patients and suggest that oxidative damage may play a role in the pathogenesis of AD."
"White matter lesions progress over time, but the clinical consequences are widely unknown. Three-hundred twenty-nine elderly community-dwelling volunteers underwent serial magnetic resonance imaging scanning and cognitive testing at baseline and at 3- and 6-year follow-up. We measured the changes in white matter lesion and brain parenchymal volumes. After 6 years, the median increase in white matter lesion load was 0.2 cm3 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.0-0.80 cm3) with a maximum of 31.4 cm3. The median loss of brain volume was 2.3% (IQR, 1.13-3.58%). Increasing white matter lesion volume was correlated with loss of brain volume (p &lt; 0.0001) and performance decline in tests of memory (p = 0.022), conceptualization (p = 0.046), and visuopractical skills (p = 0.005). Associations between changes in white matter lesion load and cognitive functioning were no longer significant when adding change in brain volume to the models, suggesting that cognitive decline related directly to loss of brain substance with progression of lesion burden."
A heterozygous R1101K mutation of the p150 subunit of dynactin (DCTN1) is reported in a family with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and co-occurrence of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Two members of our kindred were affected with motor neuron disease and two with dementia in an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. We excluded the involvement of the ALS and FTD-linked genes for copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and tau. The R1101K sequence alteration of the DCTN1 gene may predispose subjects to ALS and FTD.
"Retrospectively, we assessed the specificity of two proposed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS) in patients suspected to have MS but who ultimately receive another diagnosis. Brain MRIs of 28 patients mixed with 28 MRIs of MS patients from the same cohort of 377 consecutively referred patients were scored by a neuroradiologist masked to the final diagnosis. The criteria for dissemination in space incorporated in the McDonald International Panel showed good specificity (89%). However, the more sensitive criteria proposed by a Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology resulted in a lower specificity (29%), indicating an increased risk of a false-positive diagnosis."
"Epilepsy is a disease of recurrent seizures that can develop after a wide range of brain insults. Although surgical resection of focal regions of seizure onset can result in clinical improvement, the molecular mechanisms that produce and maintain focal hyperexcitability are not understood. Here, we demonstrate a regional, persistent induction of a common group of genes in human epileptic neocortex in 17 patients with neocortical epilepsy, regardless of the underlying pathology. This relatively small group of common genes, identified using complementary DNA microarrays and confirmed with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining, include the immediate early gene transcription factors EGR-1, EGR-2, and c-fos, with roles in learning and memory, and signaling genes such as the dual-specificity kinase/phosphatase MKP-3. Maximal expression of these genes was observed in neurons in neocortical layers II through IV. These neurons also showed persistent cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB) activation and nuclear translocation of EGR-2 and c-fos proteins. In two patients, local interictal epileptiform discharge frequencies correlated precisely with the expression of these genes, suggesting that these genes either are directly modulated by the degree of epileptic activity or help sustain ongoing epileptic activity. The identification of a common set of genes and the persistent activation of CREB signaling in human epileptic foci provide a clinically relevant set of biological markers with potential importance for developing future diagnostic and therapeutic options in human epilepsy."
"Twenty-two patients with Parkinson's disease drawn from a community-based study were followed prospectively until their deaths. Even though 18 patients had dementia, none fulfilled Braak and Braak or The National Institute on Aging and Ronald and Nancy Reagan Institute of the Alzheimer's Association, whereas all patients had limbic or neocortical Lewy body disease. The Lewy body score and Braak and Braak stage were significantly associated with the rate of cognitive decline, but only the Lewy body score was associated with the rate of cognitive decline in the univariate analyses. This study strongly suggests that Lewy body disease is the main substrate driving the progression of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease."
"Mutations in LRRK2 were recently identified in autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD), including the G2019S mutation. To evaluate its frequency, we analyzed 198 probands with autosomal dominant PD, mostly from France and North Africa. Surprisingly, the frequency in North African families (7/17, 41%) was greater than those from Europe (5/174, 2.9%). The clinical features in 21 patients, including 1 with a homozygous mutation, were those of typical PD, with lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores. There were also 15 unaffected mutation carriers, aged 32 to 74 years. LRRK2 mutations appear to be a common cause of autosomal dominant PD, particularly in North Africa."
"The concept of reserve in neuroscience maintains that there are aspects of brain structure and function that can buffer the effects of neuropathology such that the greater the reserve, the more severe the pathology must be to cause functional impairment. This article provides a concise overview of structural and functional approaches to reserve and shows how reserve may be conceived as the sum of its lifetime input. In this context, reserve therefore provides an empirical yet general model of cognitive aging and development."
"The Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS) has not been previously applied to perfusion CT (CTP). Five raters assigned ASPECTS to baseline noncontrast CT (NCCT), CT angiography source images (CTA-SI), CTP source images (CTP-SI), and CTP maps of cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and mean transit time (MTT) from 37 consecutive patients with less than 6-hour anterior circulation ischemic stroke. Major reperfusion was identified on follow-up imaging. Mean baseline ASPECTS was compared with follow-up imaging ASPECTS. Rates of favorable outcome were compared for dichotomized baseline ASPECTS. In patients with major reperfusion, mean CBV and CTP-SI ASPECTS closely predicted final infarct ASPECTS. In patients without major reperfusion, mean CBF and MTT ASPECTS best predicted final infarct ASPECTS. There were significant increases in rates of favorable outcome for CTP-SI and CBV ASPECTS of greater than 6, versus less than or equal to 6, but not for other baseline CT modalities. ASPECTS applied to CTP is more accurate at identifying the extent of reversible and irreversible ischemia and at predicting final clinical outcome than NCCTor CTA-SI."
"Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia, is multifactorial and heterogeneous; its diagnosis remains probable. We postulated that more than one disease mechanism yielded Alzheimer's histopathology, and that subgroups of the disease might be identified by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of proteins associated with senile (neuritic) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. We immunoassayed levels of tau, ubiquitin, and Abeta(1-42) in retrospectively collected CSF samples of 468 clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease patients (N = 353) or non-Alzheimer's subjects (N = 115). Latent profile analysis assigned each subject to a cluster based on the levels of these molecular markers. Alzheimer's disease was subdivided into at least five subgroups based on CSF levels of Abeta(1-42), tau, and ubiquitin; each subgroup presented a different clinical profile. These subgroups, which can be identified by CSF analysis, might benefit differently from different therapeutic drugs."
"Current knowledge of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific T-cell responses in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with EBV-related lymphoproliferative disease (EBV-LPD) in the central nervous system (CNS) is very limited. Here, we present two recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplants with EBV-LPD in the CNS. EBV-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes were detected in CSF and peripheral blood using major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I multimers loaded with EBV-derived peptides. The appearance of EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells in CSF and blood correlated with neurological improvement and disappearance of EBV-LPD. These observations suggest a role for EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells in the control of EBV-LPD in the CNS."
"""Pure"" adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) is the noninflammatory myeloneuropathic variant of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, where the disease process appears to be restricted to spinal cord tracts and peripheral nerves. The absence of obvious brain involvement makes it distinct from the inflammatory cerebral phenotypes of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. However, some pure AMN patients later experience development of cerebral demyelination, but little is known about the extent of brain involvement in pure AMN patients who have normal brain magnetic resonance imaging. We used diffusion tensor imaging to investigate possible occult cerebral abnormalities in such pure AMN patients. Fractional anisotropy and trace were studied in three-dimensional reconstructions of white matter tracts commonly involved in cerebral phenotypes of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Results demonstrated reduced fractional anisotropy and increased trace in bilateral corticospinal tracts and genu of corpus callosum (p &lt; 0.05). Diffusion tensor imaging-based three-dimensional fiber tracking showed occult tract-specific cerebral microstructural abnormalities in pure AMN patients who had a normal conventional brain magnetic resonance image. Corticospinal tract abnormalities could reflect a centripetal extension of spinal cord long-tract distal axonopathy. Accompanying abnormalities in genu of corpus callosum indicate that the disease pathology in pure AMN may not be limited to spinal cord long tracts alone, although the involvement of the latter is most prominent and severe."
"We describe a four-generation family with a previously unreported form of congenital fiber-type disproportion that follows an X-linked inheritance pattern. Affected male family members have a striking pattern of weakness. From birth there is marked ptosis, facial weakness, poor sucking, hypotonia, respiratory weakness, and relatively preserved limb strength. Most affected male individuals die of respiratory failure within the first months of life. A mild dilated cardiomyopathy developed in infancy in the sole surviving affected male member of this family. Some carrier female individuals manifest milder signs. We have demonstrated linkage to two regions of the X chromosome, Xp22.13 to Xp11.4 and Xq13.1 to Xq22.1, with a maximum logarithm of odds score of 3.25 in the latter region. We propose that clinical clues can differentiate this disorder from other forms of congenital fiber-type disproportion so that affected families can receive appropriate genetic counseling."
"We examined the relation between plasma total homocysteine (tHcy), folate, vitamin B12, and episodic memory in elderly community-dwelling subjects. A population-based study was conducted in 1992 and 1993, and subjects were re-investigated after 6 years. Plasma analytes were determined on both occasions. At follow-up, memory performance, using the Kendrick Object Learning Test, was investigated in 2,189 subjects (age, 65-67 years at baseline). Subjects with memory deficit (test score, &lt; 25) had higher tHcy and lower folate at follow-up compared with those without memory deficit: 12.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.1, 13.1) versus 11.5 (95% CI, 11.3, 11.6) micromol/L (p &lt; 0.001) for tHcy, and 6.7 (95% CI, 6.2, 7.1) versus 7.6 (95% CI, 7.5, 7.8) nmol/L (p &lt; 0.001) for folate. The risk of memory deficit increased according to quintiles of tHcy both at baseline and at follow-up. A decline in tHcy, or an increase in folate, over a 6-year period was associated with a higher memory test score; and vice versa. These findings indicate that increased plasma tHcy is an independent risk factor for memory deficit both cross-sectionally and prospectively, and that a ""favorable"" change in folate or tHcy concentrations over time is associated with better memory performance."
"The prion protein (PrP) is central to the prion diseases, although a role in other neurodegenerative diseases has been postulated. A common polymorphism (Met or Val) at codon 129 of the PrP gene (PRNP) features prominently in the risk and phenotype, of prion disease, and an abnormality in its distribution frequency may signal a role for PrP in other diseases. We conducted a case-control study to compare the PRNP codon 129 genotype distribution in Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and primary progressive aphasia (PPA), including 281 AD, 256 ALS, 39 PPA, and 415 healthy control subjects. Statistical analysis was applied to determine the presence or absence of disease-specific genotype associations. The distribution of codon 129 genotypes was similar among healthy control, AD, and ALS subjects, although the heterozygous state was significantly overrepresented (age-adjusted odds ratio, 8.47) in PPA, a rare condition of unknown cause. Although these findings do not entirely exclude a role for PrP in AD or ALS, they do not support the codon 129 genotype as a risk factor for either disease. However, the strong association between heterozygosity and PPA raises new questions about its cause and the role of PrP in other neurodegenerative diseases."
"Mutation of the spastin gene is the single most common cause of pure hereditary spastic paraparesis. In patients with an unexplained sporadic upper motor neuron (UMN) syndrome, clinical distinction between primary lateral sclerosis and sporadic hereditary spastic paraparesis may be problematic. To investigate whether spastin mutations are present in patients with primary lateral sclerosis and sporadic hereditary spastic paraparesis, we screened the spastin gene in 99 Dutch patients with an unexplained, apparently sporadic, adult-onset UMN syndrome. We found 6 mutations, of which 4 were novel, in the subgroup of 47 patients with UMN symptoms restricted to the legs (13%). Another novel spastin mutation was found in a patient with a rapidly progressive spinal and bulbar UMN syndrome that progressed to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the patients with arm or bulbar UMN symptoms and slow progression, no spastin mutations were found. Our study shows that spastin mutations are a frequent cause of apparently sporadic spastic paraparesis but not of primary lateral sclerosis."
"We conducted an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment to better understand the potentially compensatory alternative brain networks activated by a clinically relevant face-name association task in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and matched control subjects. We recruited 17 healthy subjects and 12 AD patients at an early stage of the disease. They underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning in four sessions. Each of the sessions combined a ""study"" phase and a ""test"" phase. Face/name pairs were presented in each study phase, and subjects were asked to associate faces with names. In the test phase, a recognition task, faces seen in the study phase were presented each with four different names. The task required selection of appropriate previously associated names from the study phase. Responses were recorded for post hoc classification into those successfully or unsuccessfully encoded. There were significant differences between the groups in accuracy and reaction time. Comparison of correctly versus incorrectly encoded and recognized pairs in the two groups indicated bilateral hippocampal hypoactivation both when encoding and recognizing in the AD group. Moreover, patients showed bilateral hyperactivation of parts of the parietal and frontal lobes. We discuss whether hyperactivation of a frontoparietal network reflects compensatory strategies for failing associative memory in AD patients."
"Abnormal sensory responses have been found in the upper airway of obstructive sleep apnea patients, but no long-term study has been published previously regarding the evolution of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and persistence of abnormal pharyngeal sensory evaluation in response to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. Over 5 years, we managed healthy, nonobese subjects compliant with nasal CPAP. Only 47 subjects completed this prospective study, due to protocol requirements. They underwent regular clinical evaluation, subjective scales, four polysomnographies without nasal CPAP, recalibration of nasal CPAP with polysomnography, regular downloading of home data, and a palatal two-point discrimination study. None of the subjects presented normal results at any checkpoint when they had been without CPAP for two or three nights. By the completion of the study, all subjects required an increase in nasal CPAP (1-7 cm H(2)O) and demonstrated abnormal two-point palatal discrimination compared with control subjects. Despite initial control of clinical symptoms with regular usage of nasal CPAP in subjects without weight change, abnormal sensory palatal evaluation was present at the conclusion of the study. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome involves abnormal upper airway sensory input, which may be responsible for the development of apneas and hypopneas. These neurological lesions are persistent despite nasal CPAP treatment."
"Epilepsy is associated with significant neurological morbidity, including learning disabilities, motor deficits, and behavioral problems. Although the causes of neurological dysfunction in epilepsy are multifactorial, accumulating evidence indicates that seizures in themselves may directly cause brain injury. Although it is clear that seizures can result in neuronal death, it is likely that under some circumstances seizures can induce more subtle functional or structural alterations in neurons. We induced focal neocortical seizures with 4-aminopyridine in transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein in cortical neurons and sequentially imaged individual dendrites in living animals with two-photon laser-scanning microscopy to determine whether these seizures caused acute alterations in dendritic spine morphology. No dendritic alterations were observed in anesthetized animals during electrographic seizures over a 3-hour period. Similarly, in unanesthetized mice, low-stage, clinical electrographic seizures had minimal effect on dendritic spines. More severe, high-stage seizures in unanesthetized mice were associated with a moderate loss of spines and dendritic swelling, but this effect may have been contingent on a synergistic action of phototoxicity from the imaging method itself. Overall, our results suggest that most neocortical seizures have minimal acute effects on dendrites over several hours, but may predispose to dendritic injury under extreme conditions."
"Stroke is a major public health concern with few positive phase III clinical trials and a shortage of stroke care expertise. Drug development likely can be enhanced by adapting new outcome measures and following guidelines generated by consensus groups. To enhance rates of drug implementation and to improve stroke care, some states are requiring that acute care hospitals obtain primary stroke center certification, and this mandate necessitates that smaller hospitals join larger ones in stroke care networks. Cutting-edge technology in the form of telemedicine is being implemented in stroke care networks to combat the lack of stroke care expertise by extending the availability of physician stroke expertise. The telemedicine network can be used to transmit real-time data from stroke care-certified community hospitals (spokes) to a tertiary center (hub). Telemedicine can be used to educate physicians in spoke hospitals about new stroke treatments. The advent and development of telemedicine has the potential to ensure that patients with stroke have a greater opportunity to receive the full range of therapeutic options currently available and those that will become available in the future. The implementation of future drug therapies through telemedicine-organized stroke networks will likely substantially influence the future of acute stroke therapy."
"Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy up to now has been considered a channelopathy caused by mutations in the alpha(4) and beta(2) subunits of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. However, these mutations account for only a minority of patients, and the existence of at least a new locus for the disease has been demonstrated. In one Italian nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy family, we identified two new putative loci on chromosomes 3 and 8, where several candidate genes are mapped. In particular, on chromosome 8, corticotropin-releasing hormone gene (CRH) appears to be a good candidate. We therefore searched for CRH mutations in the proband. The study allowed the identification of a nucleotide variation in the promoter that was subsequently detected in all affected and obligate carrier members of the same family, in two sporadic cases, in all affected members of an additional compliant family, and in the proband of a noncompliant family. Moreover, a different mutation in the promoter was detected in a familial case. In vitro experiments showed altered levels of gene expression. CRH alterations could explain several autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy clinical features."
"Direct genomic DNA sequencing fails to detect epsilon-sarcoglycan (SGCE) mutations in up to 30% of familial myoclonus-dystonia (M-D) cases. We identified novel large heterozygous deletions of SGCE exon 5 or exon 6 in two M-D pedigrees. Like nonsense mutations, exon rearrangements result in the generation of premature stop codons downstream of the deleted exon. SGCE exon dosage assays may identify additional families with SGCE mutation and thus reduce ""genetic heterogeneity."""
"Hypotheses that inflammation contributes to neonatal cerebral white matter damage have evolved over the last three decades. The latest, expanded here, suggests that the adaptive immune system contributes to the intensity and duration of the processes that result in damage to cerebral white matter in the fetus and newborn. We propose several mechanisms by which fetal T lymphocytes could be activated during fetal exposure to infection. These include specific recognition of bacterial antigens, specific recognition of autoantigens, polyclonal activation by Toll-like receptors, and bystander activation by cytokines."
"In a prospective population-based cohort study among 4,695 participants aged 55 years and older, with repeated in-person examination and on average 9.4 years of follow-up, we observed that higher serum levels of uric acid were associated with a significantly decreased risk of Parkinson disease (adjusted hazard ratio per standard deviation increase 0.71 [95% confidence interval 0.51-0.98]), with evidence for a dose-effect relationship (p value for trend over quartiles 0.040). Our findings support the hypothesis that oxidative stress contributes to the risk of Parkinson disease and suggest a potential protective effect of the natural antioxidant and free radical scavenger uric acid."
"Multiple mutations in the gene for the leucine-rich repeat kinase (LRRK2) cause autosomal dominant late-onset parkinsonism (PARK8). The Gly2019Ser mutation appears to be common in different populations. To investigate whether this novel gene influences the non-Mendelian sporadic form of Parkinson's disease, we genotyped 121 single nucleotide polymorphisms comprehensively covering the entire LRRK2 gene region in a set of 340 Parkinson's disease patients and 680 matched control subjects from Germany. No association could be demonstrated. We have therefore no evidence for the existence of a common variant in LRRK2 that has a strong influence on Parkinson's disease risk."
We present a 32-year-old Turkish male with juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 and a previously unrecognized homozygous deletion in exon 4 of the ALS2 gene (553delA). Disease progression is more rapid than in the ALS2 phenotype cases described to date. The patient's consanguineous parents carry the mutation in the heterozygous state as do his two unaffected brothers.
"DJ-1 gene mutations have been found to cause early-onset Parkinson's disease. We report a family from southern Italy with three brothers affected by early-onset parkinsonism, dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Molecular analysis of the DJ-1 gene in two living patients showed a novel homozygous mutation in exon 7 (E163K) and a new homozygous mutation (g.168_185dup) in the promoter region of the gene. Both mutations cosegregated with the disease and were detected in a heterozygous state in the patients' mother and their healthy siblings. Our findings expand the spectrum of clinical presentations associated with mutations in DJ-1 gene."
"Although, in principle, gene expression profiling is well suited to isolate pathogenic molecules associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), techniques such as microarray present unique analytic challenges when applied to disorders of the brain. Here, we addressed these challenges by first constructing a spatiotemporal model, predicting a priori how a molecule underlying AD should behave anatomically and over time. Then, guided by the model, we generated gene expression profiles of the entorhinal cortex and the dentate gyrus, harvested from the brains of AD cases and controls covering a broad age span. Among many expression differences, the retromer trafficking molecule VPS35 best conformed to the spatiotemporal model of AD. Western blotting confirmed the abnormality, establishing that VPS35 levels are reduced in brain regions selectively vulnerable to AD. VPS35 is the core molecule of the retromer trafficking complex and further analysis revealed that VPS26, another member of the complex, is also downregulated in AD. Cell culture studies, using small interfering RNAs or expression vectors, showed that VPS35 regulates Abeta peptide levels, establishing the relevance of the retromer complex to AD. Reviewing our findings in the context of recent studies suggests how downregulation of the retromer complex in AD can regulate local levels of Abeta peptide."
"Mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) cause frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17. Clinical variability is seen not only among families with different mutations, but also among family members with the same mutation. We investigated a newly identified familial frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism family. The disease was of early onset and was inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Clinically, parkinsonism was the prominent and often early feature, and it preceded dementia. Three autopsied cases shared involvement predominantly in the frontal and temporal lobes and also in the subcortical nuclei, including substantia nigra, globus pallidus, and subthalamic nucleus, that microscopically consisted of neuronal loss, microvacuolation, and astrocytic fibrosis. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated neuropil threads, ballooned cells, and glial fibrillary tangles. Sequencing analysis of the MAPT gene showed an alteration in one allele, resulting in a P301S substitution. These findings suggest that the MAPT P301S mutation can cause pathologically subcortical-predominant, neuropil thread-rich, tau-containing lesions, which could result in consistent parkinsonism. Our study confirms the notion that the phenotype observed in affected individuals from P301S MAPT mutation families is heterogeneous and is broader than the phenotypes seen to date in affected family members carrying other MAPT mutations."
"Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) causes central vision loss from bilateral optic neuropathy. Although 13 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are strongly associated with LHON, only three account for roughly 90% of cases and thus are found in multiple independent LHON families. The remaining LHON mutations are rare. Here, we describe the clinical and genetic characterization of a new LHON mtDNA mutation. The 12848T mutation alters a highly conserved amino acid in the ND5 complex I gene, is not found in controls, and is heteroplasmic. Despite ND5 being the largest of the mtDNA complex I genes, ND5 mutations are quite rare in LHON."
"We report 19 patients with a previously undelineated neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by episodic acute onset of irritability or neurological deficits between 2 months and 3.5 years of age, followed by steady or intermittent clinical deterioration. Seven children died between 11 months and 14 years of age. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows patchy leukoencephalopathy with cavities, and vascular permeability, in actively affected regions. Early lesions affect corpus callosum and centrum semiovale, with or without cerebellar or cord involvement. After repeated episodes, areas of tissue loss coalesce with older lesions to become larger cystic regions in brain or spinal cord. Diffuse spasticity, dementia, vegetative state, or death ensues. Gray matter is spared until late in the course. In some, incomplete clinical or MRI recovery occurs after episodes. The clinical course varies from rapid deterioration to prolonged periods of stability that are unpredictable by clinical or MRI changes. Elevated levels of lactate in brain, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid, abnormal urine organic acids, and changes in muscle respiratory chain enzymes are present but inconsistent, without identifiable mitochondrial DNA mutations or deletions. Pathological studies show severe loss of myelin sparing U-fibers, axonal disruption, and cavitary lesions without inflammation. Familial occurrence and consanguinity suggest autosomal recessive inheritance of this distinct entity."
"Several studies have reported evidence for linkage of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) to chromosome 9. Recently, an intronic polymorphism affecting alternative splicing of exon 8 of ubiquilin 1 (UBQLN1) was reported to be associated with LOAD. We attempted to replicate this observation by genotyping this polymorphism, rs12344615 (also known as UBQ-8i), in a large sample of 1,544 LOAD cases and 1,642 nondemented controls. We did not find any evidence that this single nucleotide polymorphism, or any of six others tested in UBQLN1, increases risk for LOAD."
"Metabotropic glutamate receptors alter the vulnerability of neurons to excitotoxic damage and are reported to display abnormal expression in the central nervous system of ALS patients. Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we investigated the mRNA expression of specific metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes in T lymphocytes of 20 patients with sporadic ALS, compared with healthy age-matched control subjects and patients with other neurological disorders. The levels of metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 mRNA were markedly reduced, whereas the expression of other subtypes (1b, 3, 8) was similar to control levels. Our findings may provide a reliable peripheral marker of the glutamatergic dysfunction that characterizes ALS."
"Stroke is a prevalent and devastating disorder, and no treatment is currently available to restore lost neuronal function after stroke. One unique therapy that improves recovery after stroke is neutralization of the neurite inhibitory protein Nogo-A. Here, we show, in a clinically relevant model, improved functional recovery and brain reorganization in the aged and adult rat when delayed anti-Nogo-A therapy is given after ischemic injury. These results support the efficacy of Nogo-A neutralization as treatment for ischemic stroke, even in the aged animal and after a 1-week delay, and implicate neuronal plasticity from unlesioned areas of the central nervous system as a mechanism for recovery."
"Massive catecholamine release resulting in the formation of cardiac contraction bands may represent the cause of death in status epilepticus (SE). We reviewed the cardiac pathology of patients who died during SE to asses for contraction bands. Eight of 11 patients who died during SE had identifiable myocardial contraction bands compared with 5 of 22 control patients (p &lt; 0.05, Fisher's exact t test). These findings delineate a pathological substrate and provide compelling evidence that excessive catecholamine release is the mechanism responsible for death in SE."
"The heterozygous R445H mutation in OPA1 was found in five patients with optic atrophy and deafness. Audiometry suggested that the sensorineural deafness resulted from auditory neuropathy. Skin fibroblasts showed hyperfragmentation of the mitochondrial network, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and adenosine triphosphate synthesis defect. In addition, OPA1 was found to be widely expressed in the sensory and neural cochlear cells of the guinea pig. Thus, optic atrophy and deafness may be related to energy defects due to a fragmented mitochondrial network."
"We investigated whether nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use was associated with a lower risk for Parkinson's disease (PD) in a large cohort of US men and women. PD risk was lower among ibuprofen users than nonusers. Compared with nonusers, the relative risks were 0.73 for users of fewer than 2 tablets/week, 0.72 for 2 to 6.9 tablets/week, and 0.62 for 1 or more tablets/day (p trend = 0.03). No association was found between the use of aspirin, other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or acetaminophen and PD risk. The results suggest that ibuprofen use may delay or prevent the onset of PD."
"Knowledge about the balance between heritable and nonheritable risk in multiple sclerosis (MS) is based on twin studies in high-prevalence areas. In a study that avoided ascertainment limitations and directly compared continental Italy (medium-prevalence) and Sardinia (high-prevalence), we ascertained 216 pairs from 34,549 patients. This gives a twinning rate of 0.62% among MS patients, significantly less than that of the general population. In continental Italy, probandwise concordance was 14.5% (95% confidence interval, 5.1-23.8) for monozygotic and 4.0% (95% confidence interval, 0.8-7.1) for dizygotic twins. Results in Sardinia resemble those in northern populations but in limited numbers. Monozygotic concordance was 22.2% (95% confidence interval, 0-49.3) probandwise, but no concordant dizygotic pairs were identified. A questionnaire on 80 items possibly related to disease cause was administered to 70 twin pairs, 135 sporadic patients, and 135 healthy volunteers. Variables positively (7) or negatively (2) associated with predisposition and concordance in twins largely overlapped and were mainly linked to infection. If compared with previous studies, our data demonstrate that penetrance in twins appears to correlate with MS prevalence. They highlight the relevance of nonheritable variables in Mediterranean areas. The apparent underrepresentation of MS among Italian twins draws attention to protective factors, shared by twins, that may influence susceptibility."
"Motor sequence learning is abnormal in presymptomatic Huntington's disease (p-HD). The neural substrates underlying this early manifestation of HD are poorly understood. To study the mechanism of this cognitive abnormality in p-HD, we used positron emission tomography to record brain activity during motor sequence learning in these subjects. Eleven p-HD subjects (age, 45.8 +/- 11.0 years; CAG repeat length, 41.6 +/- 1.8) and 11 age-matched control subjects (age, 45.3 +/- 13.4 years) underwent H(2) (15)O positron emission tomography while performing a set of kinematically controlled motor sequence learning and execution tasks. Differences in regional brain activation responses between groups and conditions were assessed. In addition, we identified discrete regions in which learning-related activity correlated with performance. We found that sequence learning was impaired in p-HD subjects despite normal motor performance. In p-HD, activation responses during learning were abnormally increased in the left mediodorsal thalamus and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; BA 11/47). Impaired learning performance in these subjects was associated with increased activation responses in the precuneus (BA 18/31). These data suggest that enhanced activation of thalamocortical pathways during motor learning can compensate for caudate degeneration in p-HD. Nonetheless, this mechanism may not be sufficient to sustain a normal level of task performance, even during the presymptomatic stage of the disease."
"Major depression has been shown to increase the risk for development of epilepsy, but prior studies have not evaluated whether this is due to specific symptoms of depression. We conducted a population-based case-control study of all newly diagnosed unprovoked seizures among Icelandic children and adults aged 10 years and older to test the hypothesis that major depression is a risk factor for developing unprovoked seizure and epilepsy, and to address whether specific symptoms of depression account for this increased risk. Cases were matched to the next two same sex births from the population registry. Using standardized interviews, we ascertained symptoms of major depression to make a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis. A history of major depression was 1.7-fold more common among cases than among controls (95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.7). A history of attempted suicide was 5.1-fold more common among cases than among controls (95% confidence interval, 2.2-11.5). Attempted suicide increased seizure risk even after adjusting for age, sex, cumulative alcohol intake, and major depression or number of symptoms of depression. Major depression and attempted suicide independently increase the risk for unprovoked seizure. These data suggest that depression and suicide attempt may be due to different underlying neurochemical pathways, each of which is important in the development of epilepsy."
"The epilepsy that occurs in SSADH deficiency has a seizure phenotype similar to that occurring in the SSADH(-/-) mouse. We examined the expression and function of the GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) in SSADH-deficient mice. A selective decrease in binding of [(35)S]tert-butylbicyclophosphorothionate was observed in SSADH(-/-) mice at postnatal day 7 that was progressive until the third postnatal week of life when, at the nadir of the decreased [(35)S]tert-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding, generalized convulsive seizures emerged that rapidly evolved into status epilepticus. We also observed a substantial downregulation of the beta(2) subunit of GABA(A)R, a reduction in GABA(A)-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, and augmented postsynaptic population spikes recorded from hippocampal slices. The SSADH(-/-) mouse model represents a powerful investigative tool for understanding the pathophysiology of the seizures associated with human SSADH deficiency. These data raise the possibility that progressive dysfunction of the GABA(A)R may be involved in the development of seizures in SSDAH-deficient mice. Elucidation of the precise fundamental mechanisms of the perturbation of the GABA(A)R-mediated function in SSADH(-/-) mice could lead to the development of novel treatment modalities designed to reduce the neurological morbidity in children with SSADH deficiency."
"A 15-year-old male patient presented with mental retardation, mild motor impairment, and partial deafness. Biochemical investigations showed an abnormal urinary profile of leukotrienes. Concentration of leukotriene D(4) (LTD(4)), which is usually not detectable, was highly increased, whereas LTE(4), the major urinary metabolite in humans, was completely absent. These data suggest membrane-bound dipeptidase deficiency, a new defect in leukotriene biosynthesis on the step of LTE(4) synthesis, as underlying defect."
"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a combination of motor symptoms. We identified two functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in the glycogen synthase kinase-3beta gene (GSK3B). A promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (rs334558) is associated with transcriptional strength in vitro in which the T allele has greater activity. An intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (rs6438552) regulates selection of splice acceptor sites in vitro. The T allele is associated with altered splicing in lymphocytes and increased levels of GSK3B transcripts that lack exons 9 and 11 (GSKDeltaexon9+11). Increased levels of GSKDeltaexon9+11 correlated with enhanced phosphorylation of its substrate, Tau. In a comparison of PD and control brains, there was increased in frequency of T allele (rs6438552) and corresponding increase in GSKDeltaexon9+11 and Tau phosphorylation in PD brains. Conditional logistic regression indicated gene-gene interaction between T/T genotype of rs334558 and H1/H1 haplotype of microtubule-associated protein Tau (MAPT) gene (p = 0.009). There was association between a haplotype (T alleles of both GSK3B polymorphisms) and disease risk after stratification by Tau haplotypes ((H1/H2+H2/H2 individuals: odds ratio, 1.64; p = 0.007; (H1/H1 individuals: odds ratio, 0.68; p &lt; 0.001). Ours results suggest GSK3B polymorphisms alter transcription and splicing and interact with Tau haplotypes to modify disease risk in PD."
"Interventional paired associative stimulation (IPAS) to the contralateral peripheral nerve and cerebral cortex can enhance the primary motor cortex (M1) excitability with two synchronously arriving inputs. This study investigated whether dopamine contributed to the associative long-term potentiation-like effect in the M1 in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Eighteen right-handed PD patients and 11 right-handed age-matched healthy volunteers were studied. All patients were studied after 12 hours off medication with levodopa replacement (PD-off). Ten patients were also evaluated after medication (PD-on). The IPAS comprised a single electric stimulus to the right median nerve at the wrist and subsequent transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left M1 with an interstimulus interval of 25 milliseconds (240 paired stimuli every 5 seconds for 20 minutes). The motor-evoked potential amplitude in the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle was increased by IPAS in healthy volunteers, but not in PD patients. IPAS did not affect the motor-evoked potential amplitude in the left abductor pollicis brevis. The ratio of the motor-evoked potential amplitude before and after IPAS in PD-off patients increased after dopamine replacement. Thus, dopamine might modulate cortical plasticity in the human M1, which could be related to higher order motor control, including motor learning."
"Of six patients registered in our center with nonparaneoplastic limbic encephalitis associated with antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels, the five men had rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) coincident with voltage-gated potassium channel antibody-associated limbic encephalitis onset. In three patients, immunosuppression resulted in resolution of RBD in parallel with remission of the limbic syndrome. RBD persisted in two patients with partial resolution of the limbic syndrome. Our findings suggest that RBD is frequent in the setting of voltage-gated potassium channel antibody-associated limbic encephalitis and can be related to autoimmune-mediated mechanisms. In addition, these observations suggest that impairment of the limbic system may play a role in the pathogenesis of RBD."
"Since 1992, research teams from Indiana University and the University of Ibadan have been collecting and comparing data from two diverse, elderly populations to identify risk factors for dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) was genotyped in 2,245 Nigerian samples. Of these, 830 had a diagnosis: 459 were normal, and 140 had dementia including 123 diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In contrast with other populations, the APOE epsilon4 allele was not significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease or dementia. This lack of association in the Yoruba might reflect genetic variation, environmental factors, as well as genetic/environmental interactions."
"We recently reported that the GG genotype of the interleukin-6 (IL-6)-174G&gt;C promoter polymorphism is associated with clinical presentation of intracranial hemorrhage in brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) patients. In this study, we investigated whether tissue IL-6 expression was associated with IL-6-174G&gt;C genotype, and whether IL-6 was linked to downstream targets involved in angiogenesis and vascular instability. Our results showed that the highest IL-6 protein levels in brain AVM tissue were associated with IL-6-174GG genotype (GG: 57.7 +/- 20.2; GC: 35.6 +/- 26.6; CC: 13.9 +/- 10.2pg/mg; p = 0.001). IL-6 protein levels were increased in AVM tissue from patients with hemorrhagic presentation compared with patients without hemorrhage (55 +/- 22 vs 40 +/- 27pg/mg; p = 0.038). IL-6 messenger RNA expression strongly correlated with messenger RNA levels of IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-8, matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), MMP-9, and MMP-12. We further investigated the plausibility of IL-6 being an upstream cytokine responsible for initiating the angiogenic cascade by cell culture and animal experiments. IL-6 induced MMP-3 and MMP-9 expression and activity in mouse brain and increased proliferation and migration of cerebral endothelial cells. Together, our results suggest that the IL-6 genotype associated with intracranial hemorrhage modulates IL-6 expression in brain AVM tissue, which is consistent with the hypothesis that inflammatory processes induce angiogenic activity possibly contributory to brain AVM intracranial hemorrhage."
"Neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus persists throughout life and is increased by seizures. The dentate granule cell (DGC) layer is often abnormal in human and experimental temporal lobe epilepsy, with dispersion of the layer and the appearance of ectopic granule neurons in the hilus. We tested the hypothesis that these abnormalities result from aberrant DGC neurogenesis after seizure-induced injury. Bromodeoxyuridine labeling, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry were used to identify proliferating progenitors and mature DGCs in the adult rat pilocarpine temporal lobe epilepsy model. We also examined dentate gyri from epileptic human hippocampal surgical specimens. Prox-1 immunohistochemistry and pulse-chase bromodeoxyuridine labeling showed that progenitors migrate aberrantly to the hilus and molecular layer after prolonged seizures and differentiate into ectopic DGCs in rat. Neuroblast marker expression indicated the delayed appearance of chainlike progenitor cell formations extending into the hilus and molecular layer, suggesting that seizures alter migratory behavior of DGC precursors. Ectopic putative DGCs also were found in the hilus and molecular layer of epileptic human dentate gyrus. These findings indicate that seizure-induced abnormalities of neuroblast migration lead to abnormal integration of newborn DGCs in the epileptic adult hippocampus, and implicate aberrant neurogenesis in the development or progression of recurrent seizures."
"Visual neglect after stroke is often associated with a failure to explore contralesional space. Here, we show that guanfacine, a noradrenergic agonist that modulates dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, improves leftward space exploration in selected right-hemisphere patients with neglect. The positive effects of guanfacine were associated with extended ability to maintain attention on task. The results suggest that neuropharmacological targeting of intact frontal areas might be one way to enhance cognitive function after damage to posterior brain regions in selected individuals."
"New diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis integrating magnetic resonance image assessment with clinical and other paraclinical methods were introduced in 2001. The ""McDonald Criteria"" have been extensively assessed and used since 2001. New evidence and consensus now strengthen the role of these criteria in the multiple sclerosis diagnostic workup to demonstrate dissemination of lesions in time, to clarify the use of spinal cord lesions, and to simplify diagnosis of primary progressive disease. The 2005 Revisions to the McDonald Diagnostic Criteria for MS should simplify and speed diagnosis, whereas maintaining adequate sensitivity and specificity."
"von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is caused by germline mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene. Affected individuals are predisposed to development of multiple neoplastic and preneoplastic lesions of different organs. A ""second hit,"" which is usually represented by deletion in the wild-type VHL allele at 3p25, is necessary for initiation of tumor formation. The impact of the size of this deletion is thought to be critical, because other tumor suppressor genes are located nearby, but this has not yet been studied in detail. We mapped the deletion size of the ""second hit"" in microdissected tissue from 16 different VHL-associated lesions from the same patient using 10 polymorphic chromosome 3 markers. We found that the deletion size is highly variable, ranging from short deletions around the VHL gene to complete loss of the chromosome 3. The deletion sizes are not correlated with the site of the germline mutation, the affected organ, or the type or biological behavior of the tumor. Even preneoplastic cystic structures may harbor entire loss of the chromosome 3, suggesting that loss of VHL gene function alone is not immediately causative for neoplastic growth, but further events, either mutations and deletions in other chromosomes or epigenetic or other than genetic phenomena, are required for tumor formation."
"We have identified highly similar heterozygous COL6A1 genomic deletions, spanning from intron 8 to exon 13 or intron 13, in two patients with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy and the milder Bethlem myopathy. The 5' breakpoints of both deletions are located within a minisatellite in intron 8. The mutations cause in-frame deletions of 66 and 84 amino acids in the amino terminus of the triple-helical domain, leading to intracellular accumulation of mutant polypeptides and reduced extracellular collagen VI microfibrils. Our studies identify a deletion-prone region in COL6A1 and suggest that similar mutations can lead to congenital muscle disorders of different clinical severity."
"Understanding emotions in others may involve neural structures implicated in both perception and action.1 Laughter is a socially important behavior and its neural correlates are poorly understood. Depth electrode electrophysiological techniques offer a rare opportunity to both record and stimulate neural structures involved in emotion processing. (2,3) This kind of direct electrophysiological investigation in humans is particularly determinant because laughter processing cannot be studied in animals."
"Despite many years of intensive research, multiple sclerosis (MS) defies understanding and treatment remains suboptimal. The prevailing hypothesis is that MS is immune mediated and that experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a suitable model to elucidate pathogenesis and devise therapy. This review examines critically the validity that EAE is an adequate and useful animal model of MS and finds credible evidence lacking. EAE represents more a model of acute central nervous system inflammation than the counterpart of MS. We propose to reconsider the utilization of EAE, especially when this model is used to define therapy. This will also force us to examine MS without the restraints imposed by EAE, as to what it is, rather than what it looks like."
"The neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by deposits of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides and neurofibrillary tangles, but also, among other aspects, by signs of a chronic inflammatory process. Epidemiological studies have shown that long-term use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces the risk of developing AD and delays its onset. The classic target of NSAIDs is the prevention of cyclooxygenase (COX) activation. The main mechanism of action of COXs is the synthesis of prostaglandins, some of which have potent inflammatory activity. The discovery of two isoforms of this enzyme, COX-1 and COX-2, and that the latter is inducible by inflammatory cytokines supported the hypothesis that its inhibition would result in a potent antiinflammatory effect and led to the rapid development of selective COX-2 inhibitors, collectively called coxibs. Based on this rationale, some coxibs have been used in clinical trials for AD patients, but all the results obtained so far have been negative. Here, we review our knowledge in terms of COX-2 in the central nervous system, COX-2 and Abeta formation, and finally COX-2 and AD pathogenesis to understand the reasons why these drugs have failed and whether there is any scientific support to keep them as therapeutic tools for this chronic disease."
"We describe two sisters with a mild-onset variant of Canavan's disease who presented at age 50 and 19 months with developmental delay but without macrocephaly, hypotonia, spasticity, or seizures. Remarkably, both patients had age-appropriate head control, gross motor development, and muscle tone. There were very mild deficits in fine motor skills, coordination, and gait. Both sisters had a history of strabismus, but otherwise vision was normal. The older child showed evidence of mild cognitive and social impairment, whereas language and behavior were normal for age in the infant. Both patients were found to be compound heterozygotes for C914A (A305E) and G212A (R71H) mutations in ASPA. Like all other known ASPA mutations, this previously unknown G212A mutation appears to have low absolute enzyme activity. Nevertheless, it is associated in these patients with an extremely benign phenotype that is highly atypical of Canavan's disease. Biochemical and clinical data were evaluated using a generalized linear mixed model generated from 25 other subjects with Canavan's disease. There were statistically significant differences in brain chemistry and clinical evaluations, supporting a distinct variant of Canavan's disease. Future studies of ASPA enzyme structure and gene regulation in these subjects could lead to a better understanding of Canavan's pathophysiology and improvements in ASPA gene therapy."
"Neurodegenerative diseases are often classified based on the abnormal accumulation of synuclein or tau. Traditionally, these disorders have been viewed as distinct clinical and pathological entities. However, advances in molecular genetics and protein biochemistry have shown intriguing overlaps. The most common synucleinopathy, Parkinson's disease, is characterized by extrapyramidal motor dysfunction, whereas the most common tauopathy, Alzheimer's disease, is defined by dementia. Yet there is overlap of clinical features; Parkinson's disease patients frequently have dementia, and Alzheimer's disease patients often manifest parkinsonism. Dementia with Lewy bodies exemplifies the existence of a continuum among these diseases. This overlap extends to the neuropathological findings; the pathognomonic hallmark for one set of disorders, Lewy bodies or neurofibrillary tangles, is present more often than expected in the other set. Moreover, mutations in LRRK2 known to cause parkinsonism are associated not only with dopaminergic neuronal degeneration, but also with the accumulation of synuclein, tau, neither, or both proteins. Other shared genetic features between tauopathies and synucleinopathies also exist. Finally, the known protein interactions between tau and synuclein further highlight the interface. Evidence for the intersection of tauopathies and synucleinopathies indicates the need for an updated disease classification scheme and may have important implications for therapeutic development."
"Stroke is associated with a limited degree of functional recovery. Imaging studies in humans have shown that reorganization in periinfarct and connected cortical areas most closely correlates with functional recovery after stroke. On a cellular level, two major regenerative events occur in periinfarct cortex: axons sprout new connections and establish novel projection patterns, and newly born immature neurons migrate into periinfarct cortex. Stroke induces a unique microenvironment for axonal sprouting in periinfarct cortex, in which growth-inhibitory molecules are reduced for 1 month after the infarct. During this period, neurons activate growth-promoting genes in successive waves. Neurogenesis also occurs through waves of migration of immature neurons from their origin in the subventricular zone into periinfarct cortex. This migration is mediated, in part, by the cytokine erythropoietin. These data indicate that the cellular environment after stroke is far from one of just death and destruction, but rather involves a longer evolving process of neuronal regeneration. Poststroke neuronal regeneration is characterized by waves of specific cellular and molecular events. Manipulating these waves of regeneration may provide for novel therapies that will improve recovery after stroke."
"To report two unrelated patients with a new phenotype of nonketotic hyperglycinemia associated with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. Clinical findings included rapidly progressive neurological deterioration with onset in the first year of life characterized by developmental regression without seizures or electroencephalogram abnormalities during follow-up. Both patients died before the age of 18 months. Glycine cleavage system deficiency was confirmed by enzymatic studies in frozen liver. Molecular analysis in the related genes showed no pathogenic mutation. Radiological and pathological findings were consistent with progressive vacuolating encephalopathy. Our patients with biochemical and enzymatic parameters consistent with atypical nonketotic hyperglycinemia. The clinical and radiological evolution, as progressive vacuolating leukoencephalopathy and the association with pulmonary hypertension constitute a previously unrecognized variant."
To determine the relationship between cerebral amyloid plaque load and rates of cerebral atrophy in Alzheimer's disease. (11)C-PIB((11)C-6-OH benzothiazole)PET (positron emission tomography) findings were correlated with volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements in nine subjects with mild to moderate AD. Analysis revealed a positive correlation between rates of whole brain atrophy and whole brain (p = 0.019) and regional (11)C-PIB uptake. This provides support for the central role of amyloid deposition in the pathogenesis of AD.
"B cells have long played an enigmatic role in the scenario of multiple sclerosis pathogenesis. This review summarizes recent progress in our understanding of B-cell trafficking, survival, and differentiation in the central nervous system (CNS). We propose four possible routes of intrathecal immunoglobulin-producing cells. The inflammatory CNS provides a unique, B-cell-friendly environment, in which B lineage cells, notably long-lived plasma cells, can survive for many years, perhaps even for a lifetime. These new findings offer a plausible explanation for the notorious persistence and stability of cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands. Furthermore, we highlight similarities and differences of intrathecal immunoglobulin production in multiple sclerosis patients and patients with other CNS inflammatory conditions. Finally, we outline the possibly double-edged effects of B cells and immunoglobulin in the CNS and discuss various therapeutic strategies for targeting the B-cell response."
"The histological classification of brain tumors currently is based on the morphological appearance and protein expression patterns that reflect specific cell types within the central nervous system. Recent studies have suggested that the cells of origin for brain tumors may persist in the fully formed tumors, and that these ""cancer stem cells"" might represent the relevant cellular targets for anticancer therapy. In this regard, insights into the developmental neurobiology of brain tumors has significant impact on our understanding of the molecular and cellular pathogenesis of these devastating cancers, as well as the development of new strategies for treating brain tumors."
"In their Point of View entitled ""Experimental Allergic Encephalomyelitis: A Misleading Model of Multiple Sclerosis,"" Sriram and Steiner(1) wrote, ""The most disappointing aspect of EAE [experimental allergic encephalomyelitis] as a potential model for MS is its almost total inability to point toward a meaningful therapy or therapeutic approach for MS."" Actually, EAE has led directly to the development of three therapies approved for use in multiple sclerosis (MS): glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, and natalizumab. Several new approaches to MS are in clinical trials based on positive indications in preclinical work relying on EAE. New clues to the pathogenesis of MS and new potential surrogate markers for MS are shown from research involving EAE when it is critically coupled with actual findings in MS. There are pitfalls in overreliance on the EAE model, or on any animal model for any human disease. Nevertheless, over the past 73 years, the EAE model has proved itself remarkably useful for aiding research on MS."
"Systemic administration of proteasomal inhibitors to rats has been proposed as producing progressive nigral dopaminergic cell loss and impairment of motor function, although this has proved difficult to reproduce. We report reproducible loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in substantia nigra and decrease in locomotor activity by proteasomal inhibitor injection in rats up to 10 months after treatment. Dopaminergic cell death was accompanied by the appearance of ubiquitin and alpha-synuclein-positive inclusions in the substantia nigra in these rats. Neuronal loss was also observed in the locus ceruleus, raphe nuclei, and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, verifying that proteasomal inhibition produces a relevant model of Parkinson's disease."
"Nothing is more disappointing for patients than when a promising new treatment hits a roadblock because of unexpected side effects. This is what happened when natalizumab (Tysabri) was associated with a few cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease patients, caused by the reactivation of the polyomavirus JC. These dramatic events drew PML squarely into the spotlight and generated considerable interest from the medical community, the pharmaceutical industry, financial markets, and regulatory agencies alike. This scrutiny, in turn, helped crystallize areas of consensus and expose gaps in our understanding of PML pathogenesis. Indeed, since its initial description, there has been a considerable evolution in both the epidemiology and clinical presentations of this disease, and new manifestations of central nervous system infection by polyomavirus JC have been characterized. To keep pace with this opportunistic pathogen, we are therefore forced to reexamine the foundations of our knowledge of virus-host interactions, reappraise our investigational approaches, and in short, rethink PML down to its very name. Hopefully, this crisis will be instrumental in helping us define novel avenues of research, develop predictive tests for PML in populations at risk, and challenge us to find a treatment for this deadly disease."
"Dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasomal system (UPS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. The systemic administration of UPS inhibitors has been reported to induce nigrostriatal cell death and model Parkinson's disease pathology in rodents. We administered a synthetic, specific UPS inhibitor (PSI) subcutaneously to rats and quantified substantia nigral tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic neurons by stereology. PSI caused a 15% decrease in UPS activity at 2 weeks and a 42% reduction in substantia nigra pars compacta tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons at 8 weeks. Systemic inhibition of the UPS warrants further evaluation as a means to model Parkinson's disease."
"McNaught and colleagues reported recently that systemic administration of proteasome inhibitors PSI (Z-Ileu-Glu(OtBu)-Ala-Leu-CHO) or epoxomicin recapitulated many of the degenerative changes seen in Parkinson's disease including loss of striatal dopamine and cell loss in the substantia nigra, locus ceruleus, dorsal motor nucleus of the X cranial nerve, and nucleus basalis of Meynert. Intracytoplasmic inclusions resembling Lewy bodies were also described. All experiments administering PSI to rats using identical procedures and multiple attempts failed to induce any of the previously described changes. Furthermore, administration of PSI or epoxomicin to monkeys in an attempt to extend the model to a primate species failed. Currently, systemic proteasome inhibition is not a reliable model for Parkinson's disease."
"We recently reported that systemic administration of a proteasome inhibitor induced a progressive levodopa-responsive, bradykinetic syndrome in rats with imaging, pathological, and biochemical features that strikingly resemble what is found in PD. This model has the potential to be a useful tool for studying the mechanism of cell death in Parkinson's disease and for testing putative neuroprotective agents. Since publication of these findings, several laboratories have sought to reproduce the model; some have been successful in replicating our findings, but others have not. The reason for this variability is not known, but resolution is critically important given the potential utility of this model. We have begun to examine various factors that alone or in combination might explain these differences, and we present in this article preliminary results from these studies."
"Impaired proteasome function is a potential mechanism for dopaminergic neuron degeneration. To model this molecular defect, we administered systemically the reversible lipophilic proteasome inhibitor, carbobenzoxy-L-isoleucyl-gamma-t-butyl-L-glutamyl-L-alanyl-L-leucinal (PSI), to rodents. In contrast to a previous report, this approach failed to cause any detectable behavioral or neuropathological abnormality in either rats or mice. Although theoretically appealing, this specific model of Parkinson's disease appears to exhibit poor reproducibility."
"Systemic administration of ubiquitin-proteasome system inhibitors to rodents has been reported to induce certain behavioral and neuropathological features of Parkinson's disease. The goal of this study was to replicate these observations by administering a proteasome inhibitor (PSI) to rats using McNaught and colleagues' protocol. No alterations in locomotor activity or striatal dopamine and its metabolites were observed. Differences in nigral dopaminergic cell number between proteasome inhibitor- and vehicle-treated rats and inclusion bodies were not found. Extending the time of survival after administration and using different solvents failed to alter results, indicating this proteasome inhibitor does not consistently produce the selective toxicity and pathological hallmarks characterizing Parkinson's disease."
"A consecutive series of 143 unselected adult patients with histologically proved World Health Organization grade II gliomas was reviewed to assess the prognostic value of growth rates of mean tumor diameters on successive magnetic resonance images before treatment. There is an inverse correlation between growth rates and survival (p &lt; 0.001; median survival at 5.16 years for a growth rate of 8mm/year or more; median survival &gt;15.0 years for a growth rate &lt;8mm/year). Thus, individual magnetic resonance imaging tumor growth rates should be incorporated in the planning of the initial therapeutic strategy of grade II gliomas."
"The protein profiles in the cerebrospinal fluid of 10 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), 10 patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO), 8 inflammatory disease control patients, and 4 noninflammatory disease control patients were screened by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Peaks of 12.5 kDa were significantly lower in multiple sclerosis, NMO, and inflammatory disease control patients than in noninflammatory disease control patients, and 13.4 kDa peaks were higher in NMO than in inflammatory disease control patients. Further analyses demonstrated that both peaks were cystatin C. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the cystatin C levels tended to be lower in multiple sclerosis and NMO. Alterations of cystatin C may relate to the pathogeneses of demyelinating diseases."
"Since 1999, there have been nearly 20,000 cases of confirmed symptomatic West Nile virus (WNV) infection in the United States, and it is likely that more than 1 million people have been infected by the virus. WNV is now the most common cause of epidemic viral encephalitis in the United States, and it will likely remain an important cause of neurological disease for the foreseeable future. Clinical syndromes produced by WNV infection include asymptomatic infection, West Nile Fever, and West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND). WNND includes syndromes of meningitis, encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis/poliomyelitis. The clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic features of these syndromes are reviewed here. Many patients with WNND have normal neuroimaging studies, but abnormalities may be present in areas including the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, and brainstem. Cerebrospinal fluid invariably shows a pleocytosis, with a predominance of neutrophils in up to half the patients. Diagnosis of WNND depends predominantly on demonstration of WNV-specific IgM antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid. Recent studies suggest that some WNV-infected patients have persistent WNV IgM serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid antibody responses, and this may require revision of current serodiagnostic criteria. Although there is no proven therapy for WNND, several vaccines and antiviral therapy with antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides, and interferon preparations are currently undergoing human clinical trials. Recovery from neurological sequelae of WNV infection including cognitive deficits and weakness may be prolonged and incomplete."
"A major question in the pathogenesis of motor neuron disease is why motor neurons are selectively susceptible to mutations in widely expressed gene products. Reexamination of motor neuron degeneration due to alterations of neurofilament (NF) expression suggests that disruption of assembly with aggregation of the light neurofilament (NFL) protein may be an upstream event and contributing factor leading to the preferential degeneration of motor neurons. The implications of these findings are that aggregation of NFL is not only a triggering mechanism to account for the hallmark aggregates of NF protein in sporadic and familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but that aggregates of NFL may also promote aggregation of wildly expressed proteins that are destabilized by missense mutations, such as by mutations in superoxide dismutase-1 protein. This review examines the potential role of NFs in determining and promoting the preferential degeneration of motor neurons in motor neuron disease. The underlying premise is that motor neurons are selectively susceptible to alterations in NF expression, that alterations in NF expression lead to NF aggregates in motor neurons, and that elevated levels of NF aggregates provide a favorable microenvironment for the formation of neurotoxic aggregation and degeneration of motor neurons."
"Recently, Irani and colleagues proposed a C-terminal cleaved isoform cystatin C (12.5 kDa) in cerebrospinal fluid as a marker of multiple sclerosis. In this study, we demonstrate that the 12.5 kDa product of cystatin C is formed by degradation of the first eight N-terminal residues. Moreover, such a degradation is not specific in the cerebrospinal fluid of multiple sclerosis, but rather is given by an inappropriate sample storage at -20 degrees C. We conclude that the use of the 12.5 kDa product of cystatin C in cerebrospinal fluid might lead to a fallacious diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Preanalytical validation procedure is mandatory for proteomics investigations."
"Daunting obstacles to the development of careers in academic medicine represent the most important threat to the future of academic neurology. The Long Range Planning Committee of the American Neurological Association has for the past 2 years considered what practical methods might be undertaken to enhance the attractiveness of careers as neurologist investigators and to ensure that aspiring clinician-scientists are encouraged and retained. The deliberations have resulted in several recommendations. First, a plan has been developed to introduce flexibility during residency training in neurology. This will permit trainees who plan careers in academic medicine to have a substantial exposure to research during residency, shortening the subsequent transition to independent careers. Second, the American Neurological Association will create an annual course in clinical neuroscience research, to be held each summer for academically oriented residents. Improved mentoring and career guidance was identified as a third priority, addressed in part by the development of several new courses for trainees and mentors. Finally, planning is under way for a new postresidency training program in clinical research that will link small and large departments of neurology. Beyond these recommendations, the entire continuum of training for physician-scientists should be reexamined, from the first days of college to the successful launch as independent investigators. The development of additional demonstration projects to improve the quality and reduce the total length of training would be highly desirable."
"To elucidate the role of D-serine in human central nervous system, we analyzed D-serine, L-serine, and glycine concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid of healthy children and children with a defective L-serine biosynthesis (3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency). Healthy children showed high D-serine concentrations immediately after birth, both absolutely and relative to glycine and L-serine, declining to low values at infancy. D-Serine concentrations were almost undetectable in untreated 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase-deficient patients. In one patient treated prenatally, D-serine concentration was nearly normal at birth and the clinical phenotype was normal. These observations suggest a pivotal role for D-serine in normal and aberrant human brain development."
"The blood-brain barrier is a natural diffusion barrier, which expresses active carriers extruding drugs on their way to the brain back into the blood against concentration gradients. Whereas these so-called adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporters prevent the brain entry of toxic compounds under physiological conditions, they complicate pharmacotherapies in neurological disease. Recent observations in animal models of ischemic stroke, drug-resistant epilepsy, and brain cancer showed that the prototype of ABC transporters, ABCB1, is upregulated on brain injury, deactivation of this carrier considerably enhancing the accumulation of neuroprotective, antiepileptic, and chemotherapeutic compounds. These studies provide the proof of concept that the efficacy of brain-targeting drugs may significantly be improved when drug efflux is blocked. Under clinical conditions, efforts currently are made to enhance drug accumulation by selecting new compounds that do not bind to efflux carriers or deactivating ABC transporters by targeted downregulation or pharmacological inhibition. We predict that strategies aiming at circumventing drug efflux may greatly facilitate progress in neurological therapies."
"Until 10 years ago, conventional wisdom held that Parkinson's disease was not a genetic disorder. Since that time, there have been a plethora of genetic findings, culminating in the cloning of several genes that derive from the loci given the nomenclature PARK1-PARK12 (OMIM 168600). Recently, these research findings have begun to impact clinical practice, and this impact is likely to increase. The primary purpose of this article is to outline these genetic advances, discuss their importance for current practice in clinical and related settings, and outline briefly how they are influencing research into the causes of and possible future treatments for this prevalent disorder."
"A talented medical student at our institution was recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). beta interferon was prescribed; however, her annual cap from student health insurance coverage for outpatient drug expenses is only Dollars 3000, a sum that would be exceeded within 3 months and leave her without coverage for symptomatic medications also required for her care. Unable to pay for the treatment from personal resources, she qualified to receive beta interferon without cost from a universal access program established by the manufacturer. Unfortunately, it was evident within a few months that she had a poor therapeutic response, so her physician prescribed natalizumab. Her health care plan requires that infusion therapy be given at the hospital's infusion center, yet for various reasons, the drug was not yet approved by the formulary. She remains unable to receive the drug."
The methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-methyltransferase promoter (MGMTP) was evaluated in 68 low-grade gliomas treated by neoadjuvant temozolomide. Methylated MGMTP was detected in 63 of 68 (92.6 %) patients and was a favorable predictor of progression-free survival as compared with unmethylated MGMTP tumors (p &lt; 0.0001). Assessment of MGMTP status could help identifying low-grade gliomas patients more likely to respond to chemotherapy or to benefit from MGMT depletion strategies.
"Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is a dramatic disorder of emotional expression and regulation characterized by uncontrollable episodes of laughing and crying that often cause embarrassment, curtailment of social activities, and reduction in quality of life. The disorder occurs in patients with brain injury caused by many types of neurological disease, including stroke, tumors, and neurodegenerative gray and white matter disorders. Although the pathophysiology is unknown, PBA may relate to release of brainstem emotional control centers from regulation by the frontal lobes. Diagnosis of PBA can be difficult and relies on careful characterization of episodes and differentiation from depression. Although there are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments for PBA, several agents have been shown to be effective, including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and a new agent containing dextromethorphan and quinidine. The growing number of treatment options, some of great benefit to patients, highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis of this disorder."
"Hemispherectomy for intractable unihemispheric epilepsy (IUE) has long been established in pediatric patients. This study reports the first series examining hemispherectomy exclusively in adult patients (&gt;18 years old). Nine adults with IUE underwent hemispherectomy at the University of Minnesota. All patients had unilateral hemiplegia and visual field loss. Seven patients (77.8%) were Engel class I/II at last follow-up. Five (83.3%) of the six patients with &gt;30 years of follow-up were seizure free. No surgery-related mortality, hydrocephalus, or superficial cerebral hemosiderosis occurred. Hemispherectomy is an effective procedure in appropriately selected adult patients, resulting in excellent long-term seizure control and no mortality."
"In February 2004, we initiated an epidemiological investigation within a US state to enhance autopsy surveillance for clinically suspected prion disease. During the first 30 months, 30 cases of suspected prion disease were referred from throughout Washington. Of these, 18 cases had prion disease, and all of these were classified as either familial or sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD); there was no case of variant CJD. This represents a death rate of approximately 1.1 cases of sporadic CJD per 1 million people per year in Washington. Our results do not support the hypotheses that variant CJD is an emerging illness in Washington or that sporadic CJD is more common in this state than in other regions of the world."
"Optic pathway glioma (OPG), seen in 15% to 20% of individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), account for significant morbidity in young children with NF1. Overwhelmingly a tumor of children younger than 7 years, OPG may present in individuals with NF1 at any age. Although many OPG may remain indolent and never cause signs or symptoms, others lead to vision loss, proptosis, or precocious puberty. Because the natural history and treatment of NF1-associated OPG is different from that of sporadic OPG in individuals without NF1, a task force composed of basic scientists and clinical researchers was assembled in 1997 to propose a set of guidelines for the diagnosis and management of NF1-associated OPG. This new review highlights advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical behavior of these tumors made over the last 10 years. Controversies in both the diagnosis and management of these tumors are examined. Finally, specific evidence-based recommendations are proposed for clinicians caring for children with NF1."
"We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-patient (N = 1) trial to evaluate the efficacy of zolpidem in a 48-year-old woman with an akinetic mutism. Motor and cognitive examinations and functional imaging were performed. Acute administration of zolpidem markedly improved motor performance and neuropsychological status. Cerebral metabolism ((18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) increased in postrolandic territories and in frontal cortex. Using the H(2) (15)O positron emission tomography, we found a drug-induced activation in the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices. Zolpidem induced a transient improvement in motor and cognitive performances. This paradoxical effect could result from an activation of limbic loops modulating motivational processes."
"Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are characterized by progressive lower limb spasticity and weakness. Mutations in the SPG3A gene, which encodes the large guanosine triphosphatase atlastin, are the second most common cause of autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia. In a large SPG3A screen of 70 hereditary spastic paraplegia subjects, a novel in-frame deletion, p.del436N, was identified. Characterization of this deletion showed that it affects neither the guanosine triphosphatase activity of atlastin nor interactions between atlastin and spastin. Interestingly, immunoblot analysis of lymphoblasts from affected patients demonstrated a significant reduction in atlastin protein levels, supporting a loss-of-function disease mechanism."
"""Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease,"" is heard so often that it is widely accepted as fact by the current generation of students and physicians. Yet, although it is undisputed that multiple sclerosis (MS) is immune mediated, an autoimmune mechanism remains unproven. Immune-mediated tissue damage can also result from viral infections in which the host immune response is directed to viral rather than self proteins, or as a consequence of nonspecific or bystander immune responses that change the local cytokine environment. Increasing evidence suggests that poorly controlled host immune responses account for much of the tissue damage in chronic infections, and it has been postulated that a similar mechanism may underlie many chronic diseases with features suggestive of an infectious causative factor, including MS. A recent study suggesting that oligodendrocyte death accompanied by microglial activation is the primary event in new MS lesion formation, rather than lymphocyte infiltration, could change the current mindset almost exclusively focused on autoimmunity. This review presents the rationale for considering MS a single disease caused by one virus, as well as the anticipated pattern of a persistent central nervous system infection, the application of Koch's postulates to viral discovery in MS as the causative agent, and tissue culture-independent genotypic approaches to viral discovery in MS."
"Although genetic susceptibility explains the clustering of multiple sclerosis (MS) cases within families and the sharp decline in risk with increasing genetic distance, it cannot fully explain the geographic variations in MS frequency and the changes in risk that occur with migration. Epidemiological data provide some support for the ""hygiene hypothesis,"" but with the additional proviso for a key role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in determining MS risk. We show that whereas EBV stands out as the only infectious agent that can explain many of the key features of MS epidemiology, by itself the link between EBV and MS cannot explain the decline in risk among migrants from high to low MS prevalence areas. This decline implies that either EBV strains in low-risk areas have less propensity to cause MS, or that other infectious or noninfectious factors modify the host response to EBV or otherwise contribute to determine MS risk. The role of infectious factors is discussed here; in a companion article, we will examine the possible role of noninfectious factors and provide evidence that high levels of vitamin D may have a protective role, particularly during adolescence. The primary purpose of these reviews is to identify clues to the causes of MS and to evaluate the possibility of primary prevention."
"The concept of neuroprotective therapy for acute ischemic stroke to salvage tissue at risk and improve functional outcome is based on sound scientific principles and extensive preclinical animal studies demonstrating efficacy. The failure of most neuroprotective drugs in clinical trials has been due to inadequate preclinical testing and flawed clinical development programs. The Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) group has outlined rational approaches to preclinical and clinical studies. The positive results from the first Stroke-Acute-Ischaemic-NXY-Treatment (SAINT-I) trial of the free-radical spin-trap drug, NXY-059, which followed many of the STAIR guidelines, reinvigorated enthusiasm in neuroprotection, but the SAINT-II trial did not replicate the positive effect on the same primary prespecified outcome measure. This has led to concerns about the future of neuroprotection as a therapeutic strategy for acute ischemic stroke. We discuss new suggestions to bridge the chasm between preclinical animal modeling and acute human stroke trials to potentially enhance the future assessment of novel neuroprotective drugs."
The success in mapping genetic loci and identifying mutant genes in familial neurodegenerative disease has outpaced our ability to understand the linkage between genotype and phenotype of disease. The results have led to a backlog of genetic information with limited clarification of underlying disease mechanisms. A major dilemma is how mutations in widely expressed proteins lead to degeneration or dysfunction of small subsets of neurons. The problem raises fundamental questions as to the nature and interrelation of pathways that maintain the homeostasis of differentiated neurons. The issue also bears on the pathogenesis of sporadic forms of disease and prospective efficacy of therapeutic applications. This review examines the problem as it relates to motor neuron disease.
"Retinal vessels may provide a way to study the cerebral microcirculation. In particular, larger retinal venular diameters have been associated with cerebrovascular disease. An inflammatory response may underlie this association. In a population-based cohort study among 5,279 participants aged 55 years or older with graded retinal vessel diameters, we observed that greater serum levels of C-reactive protein and fibrinogen and greater lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) activity were strongly associated with larger venular diameters. Weaker associations were found with arteriolar diameters. Our findings support the hypothesis that larger retinal venular diameters reflect systemic inflammation and suggest that inflammation is involved in cerebrovascular disease."
"The prevalence of migraine is much greater in female than male individuals. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is thought to be a fundamental mechanism of migraine, and CSD in rodents is used as a model for migraine. We used optical intrinsic signal imaging and electrophysiological techniques to investigate CSD in C57Bl/6 mice. Using two different methods for induction of CSD, we found that female mice had a significantly reduced threshold for induction of CSD compared with male mice. These results suggest an increased cortical excitability in female mice that may be independent of the estrous cycle."
"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is caused by expansion of a CAG/CAA repeat in the TBP gene. Most pathogenic alleles are interrupted and are stably transmitted from parent to offspring without anticipation. We identified three SCA17 families with expansion of uninterrupted alleles, thus greatly increasing the number of known intergenerational transmissions of such alleles. We found that uninterrupted SCA17 alleles are unstable, associated with anticipation, and show a paternal expansion bias that increases with age. Even small increments in repeat length resulted in inordinate increases in anticipation. Anticipation was also associated with childhood presentation. Sequencing of all SCA17 alleles is required for effective genetic counseling."
"As discussed in Part I of this review, the geographic distribution of multiple sclerosis (MS) and the change in risk among migrants provide compelling evidence for the existence of strong environmental determinants of MS, where ""environmental"" is broadly defined to include differences in diet and other behaviors. As we did for infections, we focus here primarily on those factors that may contribute to explain the geographic variations in MS prevalence and the change in risk among migrants. Among these, sunlight exposure emerges as being the most likely candidate. Because the effects of sun exposure may be mediated by vitamin D, we also examine the evidence linking vitamin D intake or status to MS risk. Furthermore, we review the evidence on cigarette smoking, which cannot explain the geographic variations in MS risk, but may contribute to the recently reported increases in the female/male ratio in MS incidence. Other proposed risk factors for MS are mentioned only briefly; although we recognize that some of these might be genuine, evidence is usually sparse and unpersuasive."
"DBH is a candidate gene in Parkinson's disease (PD) and contains a putative functional polymorphism (-1021C--&gt;T) that has been reported to modify PD susceptibility. We examined -1021C--&gt;T in a sample of 1,244 PD patients and 1,186 unrelated control subjects. There was no significant difference in allele (p = 0.14) or genotype (p = 0.26) frequencies between the two groups. A similar result was obtained after pooling our data with those previously published. Furthermore, we found no evidence for an effect of genotype on age at onset among patients. Our findings argue against DBH -1021C--&gt;T as a risk factor or age at onset modifier in PD."
"Peer review is a cornerstone of scientific publication. However, it is time consuming for reviewers and contributors, and must be balanced with editorial oversight for balance and bias. To test a more efficient method of reviewing manuscripts, we performed a randomized trial comparing traditional peer review for all manuscripts received by the Annals of Neurology with an early screening approach in which six editors rejected a manuscript without external review when the chance of acceptance was deemed very low. Of the 351 manuscripts entered into the trial, 88 were randomized to traditional external review and 263 to early screening. Rates of final acceptance were similar in the two groups (p = 0.41). Final decisions were more delayed for traditional review (mean 48 days versus 18 days with early screening; p &lt; 0.0001) and more reviewers were required for each manuscript (mean 2.3 versus 0.7 with early screening; p &lt; 0.0001). Among accepted manuscripts, reviewer ratings of scientific and clinical impact were similar. We conclude that a method of early screening of manuscripts for appropriateness for publication results in substantial decreases in the time between manuscript submission and publication decisions, and reduces the burden on reviewers with minimal impact on the quality of accepted manuscripts. Editorial screening is now journal policy."
"In 1954, John Enders, Thomas Weller, and Frederick Robbins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ""for their discovery of the ability of poliomyelitis viruses to grow in cultures of various types of tissue.""5370 This discovery provided for the first time opportunities to produce both inactivated and live polio vaccines. By searching previously sealed Nobel Committee archives, we were able to review the deliberations that led to the award. It appears that Sven Gard, who was Professor of Virus Research at the Karolinska Institute and an adjunct member of the Nobel Committee at the time, played a major role in the events leading to the awarding of the Prize. It appears that Gard persuaded the College of Teachers at the Institute to decide not to follow the recommendation by their Nobel Committee to give the Prize to Vincent du Vigneaud. Another peculiar feature of the 1954 Prize is that Weller and Robbins were included based on only two nominations submitted for the first time that year. In his speech at the Nobel Prize ceremony, Gard mentioned the importance of the discovery for the future production of vaccines, but emphasized the implications of this work for growing many different, medically important viruses. We can only speculate on why later nominations highlighting the contributions of scientists such as Jonas Salk, Hilary Koprowski, and Albert Sabin in the development of poliovirus vaccines have not been recognized by a Nobel Prize."
"In childhood, the risk for seizures is greatest in the neonatal period. Currently used therapies have limited efficacy. Although the treatment of neonatal seizures has not significantly changed in the past several decades, there has been substantial progress in understanding developmental mechanisms that influence seizure generation and responsiveness to anticonvulsants. This review includes an overview of current approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal seizures, identifies some of the critical factors that have limited progress, and highlights recent insights about the pathophysiology of neonatal seizures that may provide the foundation for better treatment."
"Alien hand syndrome is a rare neurological disorder in which movements are performed without conscious will. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging in a patient with alien hand syndrome after right parietal lesion, we could identify brain regions activated during involuntary or voluntary actions with the affected left hand. Alien hand movements involved a selective activation of contralateral primary motor cortex (M1), presumably released from conscious control by intentional planning systems. By contrast, voluntary movements activated a distributed network implicating not only the contralateral right M1 and premotor cortex but also the left inferior frontal gyrus, suggesting an important role of the dominant hemisphere in organizing willed actions."
"Visual hemineglect, the failure to explore the half of space, real or imagined, contralateral to a cerebral lesion with respect to body or head, can be seen as an illustration of the brain's Euclidean representation of the left/right axis. Here we present two patients with left-sided neglect, in whom only the left hemispace in front of an imagined and/or real body position was inaccessible, but the space behind them remained fully represented. These observations suggest that of the three Euclidean dimensions (up/down, left/right, and front/back), at least the latter two are modularly and separately represented in the human brain."
"To determine the role of recombinant human erythropoietin as a possible treatment option in Friedreich's ataxia, we performed an open-label clinical pilot study. Primary outcome measure was the change of frataxin levels at week 8 versus baseline. Twelve Friedreich's ataxia patients received 5,000 units recombinant human erythropoietin three times weekly subcutaneously. Frataxin levels were measured in isolated lymphocytes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and serum peroxides, were measured. Treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin showed a persistent and significant increase in frataxin levels after 8 weeks (p &lt; 0.01). All patients showed a reduction of oxidative stress markers."
"In primates, ventral premotor and rostral inferior parietal neurons fire during the execution of hand and mouth actions. Some cells (called mirror neurons) also fire when hand and mouth actions are just observed. Mirror neurons provide a simple neural mechanism for understanding the actions of others. In humans, posterior inferior frontal and rostral inferior parietal areas have mirror properties. These human areas are relevant to imitative learning and social behavior. Indeed, the socially isolating condition of autism is associated with a deficit in mirror neuron areas. Strategies inspired by mirror neuron research recently have been used in the treatment of autism and in motor rehabilitation after stroke."
"Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) deficiency (OMIM 191290) is one cause of early-onset dopa-responsive dystonia. We describe seven cases from five unrelated families with dopa-responsive dystonia and low homovanillic acid in cerebrospinal fluid who were suspected to suffer from TH deficiency. Analysis of part of the TH promotor showed five homozygous and two heterozygous mutations in the highly conserved cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element. Our data suggest that, if no mutations are found in the coding regions of the gene in patients strongly suspected of TH deficiency, the search for pathogenic mutations should be extended to regulatory promotor elements."
"We report on two patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who were exhibiting a peculiar and stereotyped behavior characterized by an irrepressible need to sing compulsively when under high-dose dopamine replacement therapy. Sharing many features with punding, this singing behavior is proposed as a distinct manifestation of the dopamine dysregulation syndrome in Parkinson's disease."
"Recently, alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde (alpha-AASA) dehydrogenase deficiency was shown to cause pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy in a considerable number of patients. alpha-AASA dehydrogenase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a neonatal-onset epileptic encephalopathy in which seizures are resistant to antiepileptic drugs but respond immediately to the administration of pyridoxine (OMIM 266100). Increased plasma and urinary levels of alpha-AASA are associated with pathogenic mutations in the alpha-AASA dehydrogenase (ALDH7A1/antiquitin) gene. Here, we report an intriguing ""silent"" mutation in ALDH7A1, a novel missense mutation and a founder mutation in a Dutch cohort (10 patients) with alpha-AASA dehydrogenase deficiency."
"The effects of cancer treatments such as cranial radiation and chemotherapy on human hippocampal neurogenesis remain unknown. In this study, we examine neuropathological markers of neurogenesis and inflammation in the human hippocampus after treatment for acute myelogenous leukemia or medulloblastoma. We demonstrate a persistent radiation-induced microglial inflammation that is accompanied by nearly complete inhibition of neurogenesis after cancer treatment. These findings are consistent with preclinical animal studies and suggest potential therapeutic strategies."
"We report four heterozygous dynamin 2 (DNM2) mutations in five centronuclear myopathy patients aged 1 to 15 years. They all presented with neonatal hypotonia with weak suckling. Thereafter, their phenotype progressively improved. All patients demonstrated muscle weakness prominent in the lower limbs, and most of them also presented with facial weakness, open mouth, arched palate, ptosis, and ophthalmoparesis. Electrophysiology showed only myopathic changes, and muscle biopsies showed central nuclei and type 1 fiber hypotrophy and predominance. Our results expand the phenotypic spectrum of dynamin 2-related centronuclear myopathy from the classic mild form to the more severe neonatal phenotype."
"Certain low-molecular-weight substrate analogs act both as in vitro competitive inhibitors of lysosomal hydrolases and as intracellular enhancers (chemical chaperones) by stabilization of mutant proteins. In this study, we performed oral administration of a chaperone compound N-octyl-4-epi-beta-valienamine to G(M1)-gangliosidosis model mice expressing R201C mutant human beta-galactosidase. A newly developed neurological scoring system was used for clinical assessment. N-Octyl-4-epi-beta-valienamine was delivered rapidly to the brain, increased beta-galactosidase activity, decreased ganglioside G(M1), and prevented neurological deterioration within a few months. No adverse effect was observed during this experiment. N-Octyl-4-epi-beta-valienamine will be useful for chemical chaperone therapy of human G(M1)-gangliosidosis."
"Although the cause of multiple sclerosis (MS) has remained obscure, many findings support an autoimmune pathogenesis on the background of a complex interaction between multiple genes and environmental factors. Accordingly, targeting the immune system has been a rational approach for the treatment of MS. The development of disease-modifying immunomodulatory drugs with partial efficacy, coupled with advances in understanding the pathophysiology and pathology of MS, has provided momentum to explore more specific and hopefully more effective immune-based therapeutic strategies. With increased knowledge and appreciation of the contribution of neurodegenerative processes to disease pathology, the therapeutic challenges, however, have become even more formidable. Future treatments will likely need both to target inflammation and to focus on promotion of neuroprotection and repair. In this review, we discuss the most promising therapeutic approaches for MS currently in the pipeline."
"The identification in 1993 of superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) mutations as the cause of 10 to 20% of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases, which represents 1 to 2% of all amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases, prompted a substantial amount of research into the mechanisms of SOD1-mediated toxicity. Recent experiments have demonstrated that oxidation of wild-type SOD1 leads to its misfolding, causing it to gain many of the same toxic properties as mutant SOD1. In vitro studies of oxidized/misfolded SOD1 and in vivo studies of misfolded SOD1 have indicated that these protein species are selectively toxic to motor neurons, suggesting that oxidized/misfolded SOD1 could lead to ALS even in individuals who do not carry an SOD1 mutation. It has also been reported that glial cells secrete oxidized/misfolded mutant SOD1 to the extracellular environment, where it can trigger the selective death of motor neurons, offering a possible explanation for the noncell autonomous nature of mutant SOD1 toxicity and the rapid progression of disease once the first symptoms develop. Therefore, considering that sporadic (SALS) and familial ALS (FALS) cases are clinically indistinguishable, the toxic properties of mutated SOD1 are similar to that of oxidized/misfolded wild-type SOD1 (wtSOD1), and secreted/extracellular misfolded SOD1 is selectively toxic to motor neurons, we propose that oxidized/misfolded SOD1 is the cause of most forms of classic ALS and should be a prime target for the design of ALS treatments."
"We evaluated the incidence, volume, and spatial distribution of T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging lesions in 58 children with clinically isolated syndromes at risk for multiple sclerosis compared with 58 adults with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Pediatric patients with clinically isolated syndromes who had brain lesions had supratentorial lesion volumes similar to adult multiple sclerosis patients, but greater infratentorial lesion volumes (p &lt; 0.009), particularly in the pons of male patients. The predilection for infratentorial lesions the pediatric patients with clinically isolated syndromes may reflect immunological differences or differences in myelin, possibly related to the caudorostral temporal gradient in myelin maturation."
"Several autoimmune myelopathies are recognized clinically. We describe 57 patients in whom serological evaluation for myelopathy of uncertain cause demonstrated collapsin response-mediator protein 5 IgG. Most had spinal imaging and cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities and insidiously progressive presentation; some had acute monophasic or relapsing myelopathy. Initial diagnoses included multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, and unspecified neurodegenerative myelopathy. Most were smokers; neoplasia was discovered in 68% (most commonly small-cell lung carcinoma and after collapsin response-mediator protein-5 IgG detection). Collapsin response-mediator protein-5 autoimmune myelopathy and occult neoplasia are important considerations in patients with insidiously progressive myelopathy, especially with known cancer risk."
"Environmental agents, including viruses, prions, and toxins, have been implicated in the cause of a number of neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The presence of smell loss and the pathological involvement of the olfactory pathways in the formative stages of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, together with evidence that xenobiotics, some epidemiologically linked to these diseases, can readily enter the brain via the olfactory mucosa, have led to the hypothesis that Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases may be caused or catalyzed by agents that enter the brain via this route. Evidence for and against this concept, the ""olfactory vector hypothesis,"" is addressed in this review."
"Complex I deficiency is the most common respiratory chain defect, clinically manifesting by severe neonatal lactic acidosis, Leigh's disease, or various combinations of cardiac, hepatic, and renal disorders. Using homozygosity mapping, we identified a splice-site mutation in the NDUFA11 gene in six patients from three unrelated families. The patients presented with encephalocardiomyopathy or fatal infantile lactic acidemia. The mutation is predicted to abolish the first transmembrane domain of the gene product, thereby destabilizing the enzymatic complex. Mutation analysis of the NDUFA11 is warranted in isolated complex I deficiency presenting with infantile lactic acidemia or encephalocardiomyopathy."
"To identify novel causes of familial neurodegenerative diseases, we extended our previous studies of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) proteinopathies to investigate TDP-43 as a candidate gene in familial cases of motor neuron disease. Sequencing of the TDP-43 gene led to the identification of a novel missense mutation, Ala-315-Thr, which segregates with all affected members of an autosomal dominant motor neuron disease family. The mutation was not found in 1,505 healthy control subjects. The discovery of a missense mutation in TDP-43 in a family with dominantly inherited motor neuron disease provides evidence of a direct link between altered TDP-43 function and neurodegeneration."
"Over the past decade, the hospitalist model has become a dominant system for the delivery of general adult and pediatric inpatient care. Similar forces, including national mandates to improve safety and quality and intense pressure to safely reduce length of hospital stays, that led to the remarkable growth of hospitalist medicine are now exerting pressure on neurologists. A neurohospitalist model, in which inpatient neurology specialists deliver high-quality and efficient care to neurology patients, is emerging to meet these challenges. Benefits of this system may include more frequent, timely neurology consultations in the hospital and emergency department, as well as improved quality of inpatient neurological education for residents and medical students. Challenges will involve defining the relationship of neurohospitalists with primary stroke centers, the economic feasibility of such neurohospitalist systems, and how to train members of this new field. A neurohospitalist model of care is an emerging idea in neurology that would overcome many regulatory, educational, and economic challenges facing neurologists; further research is needed to gauge the effects of this innovative approach."
"Mutant superoxide dismutases type 1 (SOD1s) cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by an unidentified toxic property. In a patient carrying the G127X truncation mutation, minute amounts of SOD1 were found in ventral horns using a mutant-specific antibody. Still, both absolute levels and ratios versus wild-type SOD1 were considerably greater than in other central nervous system areas and peripheral organs. Inclusions of mutant SOD1 were abundant in motoneurons but were also seen in hepatocytes and kidney epithelium. This first examination of mutant SOD1 in both central nervous system and peripheral organs supports the notion that enrichment of misfolded SOD1s might explain the particular vulnerability of motor areas."
"Our aim was to develop a detailed clinical description of fatal familial insomnia in a large patient group with respect to the M129V genotype. Data on 41 German fatal familial insomnia patients were analyzed. Clinical features, 14-3-3 proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, polysomnography, and electroencephalography were studied. Age at disease onset, disease duration, and clinical syndrome varied depending on the codon 129 genotype. Because the sensitivity of the most diagnostic tests is low in fatal familial insomnia, detailed clinical investigation is extremely important. Polysomnography may help to support the diagnosis."
"We evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and activity of B-cell depletion with rituximab in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, receiving two courses of rituximab 6 months apart, and followed for a total of 72 weeks. No serious adverse events were noted; events were limited to mild-to-moderate infusion-associated events, which tended to decrease with subsequent infusions. Infections were also mild or moderate, and none led to withdrawal. Fewer new gadolinium-enhancing or T2 lesions were seen starting from week 4 and through week 72. An apparent reduction in relapses was also observed over the 72 weeks compared with the year before therapy."
"The objective is to determine whether corticosteroid administration before biopsy prevents histopathological diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). A retrospective review was performed of immunocompetent PCNSL patients from 1985 to 2005. A total of 109 patients was identified. Sixty-eight (63.6%) patients received corticosteroids before diagnosis. Thirteen patients (of 109; 12%) had undergone repeat brain biopsy to confirm PCNSL. These included 8 (of 68) patients who had received corticosteroids (12%), and 5 (of 39) who had not (13%) (p = 1.0). The majority of PCNSL patients who received corticosteroids before diagnosis did not experience significant radiographic change or require second biopsy for diagnosis."
"Rates of progression vary widely in primary progressive multiple sclerosis. This multicenter study aimed to identify predictors of progression over 10 years. A total of 101 patients who had been imaged at baseline and 2 years were scored on the expanded disability status scale after 10 years. Ordinal logistic regression identified the following independent variables that predicted progression: male sex, shorter disease duration, and slower timed walk test at baseline (best overall predictor), and deterioration in expanded disability status scale score and reduction in brain volume over 2 years. These predictors of long-term disability provide some insight into disease progression."
"A new c.740G&gt;A (R247H) mutation in OPA1 alternate spliced exon 5b was found in a patient presenting with bilateral optic neuropathy followed by partial, spontaneous visual recovery. R247H fibroblasts from the patient and his unaffected father presented unusual highly tubular mitochondrial network, significant increased susceptibility to apoptosis, oxidative phosphorylation uncoupling, and altered OPA1 protein profile, supporting the pathogenicity of this mutation. These results suggest that the clinical spectrum of the OPA1-associated optic neuropathies may be larger than previously described, and that spontaneous recovery may occur in cases harboring an exon 5b mutation."
"We determined whether serum cystatin C, a novel measure of kidney function that colocalizes with brain beta-amyloid, is associated with cognition among 3,030 elders. Those with high cystatin C (n = 445; 15%) had worse baseline scores on Modified Mini-Mental State Examination or Digit Symbol Substitution Test (p &lt;or= 0.02) compared with those with intermediate/low level and 7 years greater decline (p &lt;or= 0.04). Incident cognitive impairment (decline &gt;or=1.0 standard deviation) was greatest among those with high cystatin C (Modified Mini-Mental State Examination: 38 vs 25%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.37-2.69; Digit Symbol Substitution: 38 vs 26%; odds ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.15)."
"Hereditary optic neuropathies are heterogeneous diseases characterized by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells leading to optic nerve atrophy and impairment of central vision. We found a common coupling defect of oxidative phosphorylation in fibroblasts of patients affected by autosomal dominant optic atrophy (mutations of OPA1), autosomal dominant optic atrophy associated with cataract (mutations of OPA3), and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, a disorder associated with point mutations of mitochondrial DNA complex I genes. Interestingly, the energetic defect was significantly more pronounced in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and autosomal dominant optic atrophy patients with a more complex phenotype, the so-called plus phenotype."
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder. Accumulating evidence has shown that 43kDa TAR-DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) is the disease protein in ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. We previously reported a familial ALS with Bumina bodies and TDP-43-positive skein-like inclusions in the lower motor neurons; these findings are indistinguishable from those of sporadic ALS. In three affected individuals in two generations of one family, we found a single base-pair change from A to G at position 1028 in TDP-43, which resulted in a Gln-to-Arg substitution at position 343. Our findings provide a new insight into the molecular pathogenesis of ALS."
"Stroke remains a leading cause of adult disability. Some degree of spontaneous behavioral recovery is usually seen in the weeks after stroke onset. Variability in recovery is substantial across human patients. Some principles have emerged; for example, recovery occurs slowest in those destined to have less successful outcomes. Animal studies have extended these observations, providing insight into a broad range of underlying molecular and physiological events. Brain mapping studies in human patients have provided observations at the systems level that often parallel findings in animals. In general, the best outcomes are associated with the greatest return toward the normal state of brain functional organization. Reorganization of surviving central nervous system elements supports behavioral recovery, for example, through changes in interhemispheric lateralization, activity of association cortices linked to injured zones, and organization of cortical representational maps. A number of factors influence events supporting stroke recovery, such as demographics, behavioral experience, and perhaps genetics. Such measures gain importance when viewed as covariates in therapeutic trials of restorative agents that target stroke recovery."
"Peripheral blood is a readily available tissue source allowing relatively noninvasive screening for a host of medical conditions. We screened total-blood progranulin (PGRN) levels in 107 patients with neurodegenerative dementias and related conditions, and 36 control subjects, and report the following findings: (1) confirmation of high progranulin expression levels in peripheral blood; (2) two subjects with reduced progranulin levels and mutations in the PGRN gene confirmed by direct sequencing; and (3) greater PGRN messenger RNA levels in patients with clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. This proof-of-principle report supports the use of gene quantification as diagnostic screen for PGRN mutations and suggests a potential role for progranulin in Alzheimer's disease."
"We report chronic histopathological features in thrombi mechanically retrieved from five acute ischemic stroke patients with a median age of 68 years and a median pretreatment National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 13. Early endothelialization occurred over and within the thrombus, and calcifications were seen, in addition to the usual acute laminar fibrin, intervening red blood cells, and neutrophils. The effectiveness of tissue plasminogen activator in clot dissolution might be affected by these features, if extensive. Thrombus composition could critically determine the success of chemical thrombolysis. Our results should stimulate the development of imaging modalities to determine thrombus composition."
"Common genetic variants that increase the risk for Parkinson's disease may differentiate patient subgroups and influence future individualized therapeutic strategies. Herein we show evidence for leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) c.4883G&gt;C (R1628P) as a risk factor in ethnic Chinese populations. A study of 1,986 individuals from 3 independent centers in Taiwan and Singapore demonstrates that Lrrk2 R1628P increases risk for Parkinson's disease (odds ratio, 1.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-2.83; p = 0.006). Haplotype analysis suggests an ancestral founder for carriers approximately 2,500 years ago. These findings support the importance of LRRK2 variants in sporadic Parkinson's disease. Ann Neurol 2008."
"Traditional risk factors associated with adult arterial ischemic stroke (AIS; ie, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking, and atherosclerosis) are relatively rare in children. Childhood AIS is instead associated with a variety of conditions including cerebral arteriopathies, congenital heart disease, infection, head and neck trauma, sickle cell anemia, and prothrombotic abnormalities. Although the pathophysiology and outcomes of adult AIS differ significantly from those in childhood AIS, therapeutic management remains similar, largely because of the paucity of evidence from devoted pediatric observational studies and clinical trials. The purpose of this article is to review the current guidelines and evidence in the treatment of childhood AIS, within the context of that which exists in adult AIS. Medical management of hypoxia, hyperglycemia, fever, blood pressure, and increased intracranial pressure has been insufficiently investigated in childhood stroke, resulting in a lack of guidance in these areas. Although acute antithrombotic management in childhood AIS has received relatively greater attention in published recommendations, it is based almost exclusively on consensus and expert opinion, and differs considerably among existing pediatric guidelines. Rehabilitation therapy in childhood AIS has great potential for meaningful improvements in long-term outcomes, especially given the plasticity of the young brain; however, little guidance for rehabilitative measures is provided by published recommendations. Ongoing and future multicenter cohort study efforts, and ultimately devoted pediatric clinical trials, will be essential to establish comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of childhood AIS."
"Falls pose an important problem to neurologists caring for patients with cerebellar disorders. Normal human gait is characterized by prominent up-and-down linear head movements (vertical translations). Thus, we asked whether patients with cerebellar gait ataxia showed abnormal responses of otolithic vestibuloocular reflexes to this motion. Compared with healthy subjects, all cerebellar patients showed impaired otolith-ocular responses. Neurologists often test the rotational vestibuloocular reflexes in cerebellar patients, but our results indicate that vestibular responses to vertical linear motion are severely affected. Impairment of the corresponding otolith-spinal reflexes may contribute substantially to falls."
"To clarify the relation between the drainage pathway of cerebrospinal fluid and the development of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), we examined flow patterns of internal jugular veins in 20 patients with iNPH and 13 control patients using air-contrast ultrasound venography during the Valsalva maneuver. The iNPH group had a significantly greater frequency of retrograde jugular venous flow (19/20, 95%) than the control group (3/13, 23%) (chi(2) test, p &lt; 0.001). Our results suggest that retrograde jugular venous flow may be associated with the development of iNPH; therefore, the analysis of retrograde jugular venous flow could be a useful element in the diagnosis of iNPH."
"Spontaneous behavioral recovery is usually limited after stroke, making stroke a leading source of disability. A number of therapies in development aim to improve patient outcomes not by acutely salvaging threatened tissue, but instead by promoting repair and restoration of function in the subacute or chronic phase after stroke. Examples include small molecules, growth factors, cell-based therapies, electromagnetic stimulation, device-based strategies, and task-oriented and repetitive training-based interventions. Stage of development across therapies varies widely, from preclinical to late-phase clinical trials. The optimal methods to prescribe such therapies require further studies, for example, to best identify appropriate patients or to guide features of dosing. Likely, anatomic, functional, and behavioral measures of brain state, as well as measures of injury, will each be useful in this regard. Considerations for clinical trials of restorative therapies are provided, emphasizing both similarities and points of divergence with acute stroke clinical trial design."
"A recent study has reported an excellent correlation between intraocular pressure (IOP) and intracranial pressure (ICP), suggesting that measurement of IOP may serve as a noninvasive means to determine ICP. To reexamine the relation between IOP and ICP, we reviewed the medical records of all patients who underwent lumbar puncture between 1991 and 2007 in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic at the University of California San Francisco. Data for IOP and ICP were available for 55 patients. There was no correlation between IOP and ICP (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.07; p = 0.59). IOP measurement is not a useful substitute for ICP measurement."
"In the past century, particularly the last decade, there has been enormous progress in our understanding of frontotemporal dementia, a non-Alzheimer's type dementia. Large clinicopathological series have been published that have clearly demonstrated an overlap between the clinical syndromes subsumed under the term frontotemporal dementia and the progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome, corticobasal syndrome, and motor neuron disease. There have also been significant advancements in brain imaging, neuropathology, and molecular genetics that have led to different approaches to classification. Unfortunately, the field is complicated by a barrage of overlapping clinical syndromes and histopathological diagnoses that does not allow one to easily identify relations between individual clinical syndromic presentations and underlying neuropathology. This review deciphers this web of terminology and highlights consistent, and hence important, associations between individual clinical syndromes and neuropathology. These associations could ultimately allow the identification of appropriate patient phenotypes for future targeted treatments."
"Human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is a neglected disease, and it continues to pose a major threat to 60 million people in 36 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Transmitted by the bite of the tsetse fly, the disease is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Trypanosoma and comes in two types: East African human African trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and the West African form caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. There is an early or hemolymphatic stage and a late or encephalitic stage, when the parasites cross the blood-brain barrier to invade the central nervous system. Two critical current issues are disease staging and drug therapy, especially for late-stage disease. Lumbar puncture to analyze cerebrospinal fluid will remain the only method of disease staging until reliable noninvasive methods are developed, but there is no widespread consensus as to what exactly defines biologically central nervous system disease or what specific cerebrospinal fluid findings should justify drug therapy for late-stage involvement. All four main drugs used for human African trypanosomiasis are toxic, and melarsoprol, the only drug that is effective for both types of central nervous system disease, is so toxic that it kills 5% of patients who receive it. Eflornithine, alone or combined with nifurtimox, is being used increasingly as first-line therapy for gambiense disease. There is a pressing need for an effective, safe oral drug for both stages of the disease, but this will require a significant increase in investment for new drug discovery from Western governments and the pharmaceutical industry."
"In contrast with more common dementing conditions that typically develop over years, rapidly progressive dementias can develop subacutely over months, weeks, or even days and be quickly fatal. Because many rapidly progressive dementias are treatable, it is paramount to evaluate and diagnose these patients quickly. This review summarizes recent advances in the understanding of the major categories of RPD and outlines efficient approaches to the diagnosis of the various neurodegenerative, toxic-metabolic, infectious, autoimmune, neoplastic, and other conditions that may progress rapidly."
"Humans have an individual profile of the electroencephalographic power spectra at the 8 to 16 Hz frequency during non-rapid eye movement sleep that is stable over time and resistant to experimental perturbations. We tested the hypothesis that this electroencephalographic ""fingerprint"" is genetically determined, by recording 40 monozygotic and dizygotic twins during baseline and recovery sleep after prolonged wakefulness. We show a largely greater similarity within monozygotic than dizygotic pairs, resulting in a heritability estimate of 96%, not influenced by sleep need and intensity. If replicated, these results will establish the electroencephalographic profile during sleep as one of the most heritable traits of humans."
"The timing and yield of metabolic studies for patients with neurodevelopmental disorders is a matter of continuing debate. We determined the yield of additional or repeated metabolic studies in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. Patients referred to a tertiary diagnostic center for patients with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders were included. Initial metabolic studies had been performed in most patients (87%) before referral. Additional/repeated metabolic studies were individually tailored. Twelve metabolic diseases of 433 patients studied (2.8%) were diagnosed, despite normal initial metabolic studies before referral. Specific metabolic investigations lead to a greater diagnostic yield in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders."
We investigated whether the integrity of the corticospinal tract classified by diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) can predict the motor outcome in 25 patients with pontine infarct. DTTs were obtained in the early stage of stroke (5-30 days) and were classified into two groups (type A: the integrity of corticospinal tract was preserved around the infarct; type B: corticospinal tract was interrupted). DTT type A patients showed better motor function than the type B patients at 6 months after onset. DTT obtained at the early stage of pontine infarct appears to have predictive value for motor outcome in patients with pontine infarct.
"We analyzed whether genetic variation of alpha-synuclein modulates the extent of neuropathological changes in a population-based autopsied sample of 272 elderly Finns. None of the 11 markers was associated with the extent of neocortical beta-amyloid pathology. The intron 4 marker rs2572324 was associated with the extent of neurofibrillary pathology (p = 0.0006, permuted p = 0.004; Braak stages IV-VI vs 0-II). The same variant also showed a trend for association with neocortical Lewy-related pathology. These results suggest for the first time that variation of alpha-synuclein modulates neurofibrillary tau pathology and support the recent observations of an interaction of alpha-synuclein and tau in neurodegeneration."
"Early treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, plus nutritional support extended median survival of spinal muscular atrophy mice by 170%. Treated mice continued to gain weight, maintained stable motor function, and retained intact neuromuscular junctions long after trichostatin A was discontinued. In many cases, ultimate decline of mice appeared to result from vascular necrosis, raising the possibility that vascular dysfunction is part of the clinical spectrum of severe spinal muscular atrophy. Early spinal muscular atrophy disease detection and treatment initiation combined with aggressive ancillary care may be integral to the optimization of histone deacetylase inhibitor treatment in human patients."
"The motor complications associated with levodopa therapy, namely, fluctuations in motor response and dyskinesias, occur in the majority of Parkinson's disease patients. These complications can impair a patient's quality of life and even cause pronounced disability. ""Off"" states that result in freezing of gait and falling are disabling for many patients. Dyskinesias most commonly occur at peak dose and typically alternate with the wearing-off state. Once these problems appear, they usually persist, and the physician needs to make continual adjustments in medications to minimize these problems. Medical treatments should be attempted before treatments such as deep brain stimulation are considered because of the potential adverse effects that are associated with surgery. The timing of surgery, however, is also important because younger patients and less advanced patients tend to have a better outcome. There is thus a need for experienced and knowledgeable physicians and surgeons who are able to handle these motor complications. This review discusses available medications and surgical approaches, and their outcomes."
"There is an increasing awareness that impulse control disorders (ICDs), including compulsive gambling, buying, sexual behavior, and eating, can occur as a complication of Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, other impulsive or compulsive disorders have been reported to occur, including dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) and punding. Case reporting and prospective studies have reported an association between ICDs and the use of dopamine agonists (DAs), particularly at greater dosages, whereas dopamine dysregulation syndrome has been associated with greater dosages of levodopa or short-acting DAs. Data suggest that risk factors for an ICD may include male sex, younger age or younger age at PD onset, a pre-PD history of ICD symptoms, personal or family history of substance abuse or bipolar disorder, and a personality style characterized by impulsiveness. Although psychiatric medications are used clinically in the treatment of ICDs, there is no empiric evidence supporting their use in PD. Therefore, management for clinically significant ICD symptoms should consist of modifications to dopamine replacement therapy, particularly DAs, and there is emerging evidence that such management is associated with an overall improvement in ICD symptomatology. It is important that PD patients be aware that DA use may lead to the development of an ICD, and that clinicians monitor patients as part of routine clinical care. As empirically validated treatments for ICDs are emerging, it will be important to examine their efficacy and tolerability in individuals with cooccurring PD and ICDs."
"Cognitive impairment is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and involves attentional, executive, visuospatial, and memory dysfunctions. Dementia is more frequently encountered in PD than in age-matched control populations, and whereas operational definitions of Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies have been developed, Parkinson's disease dementia (PD-D) has remained undefined. The Movement Disorder Society developed a task force to define and develop diagnostic guidelines for PD-D. This effort was based on existing descriptive studies with special emphasis on drawing distinction among Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and PD-related cognitive impairment without dementia whenever possible. The second goal was to provide practical diagnostic procedures to diagnose PD-D. This effort emphasized available bedside tools that do not require neuropsychological expertise to administer or interpret. This work recently has been completed, and two primary articles have been published. The suggested clinical diagnostic criteria for PD-D involve four domains and are anchored in core features, associated clinical features, features that make the diagnosis uncertain, and features that are not compatible with the diagnosis of PD-D. When all four criteria are satisfactorily met, probable PD-D is designated; when the first and last criteria are met, but clinical characteristics are atypical or uncertainty factors exist, possible PD-D is designated. Whereas these definitions are operative and subject to change based on future data, they are based on widely available tests. The inclusion criteria can be applied internationally and in multicenter research on treatment interventions, clinicopathological correlations, and studies of cognitive and other nonmotor elements of PD."
"There is increasing evidence to challenge the traditional view that the initiation of drug treatment in Parkinson's disease (PD) should be delayed until the patient has significant disability such as to affect work or social function. Firstly, to delay treatment sentences the patient to protracted impairment of quality of life that could be improved by therapy. Secondly, there is evidence to support the notion that earlier rather than later initiation of treatment leads to better long term motor benefit. The selection of which drug to begin must be tailored to the patient's individual characteristics and circumstances. Monoamine oxidase B inhibitors result in a mild improvement in motor function compared to dopamine agonists or levodopa. They are well tolerated, easy to use once a day drugs and there is evidence that early use of Rasagiline improves motor outcome. Dopamine agonists lead to a substantial improvement in motor function and are, or will shortly be, available as once a day drugs. They are generally well tolerated but can be associated with exacerbating confusion or hallucinations and with behavioral changes. Levodopa is the most potent of the dopaminergic drugs. It is routinely combined with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor and can also be used with a catecholo-o-methyl transferase inhibitor for enhanced absorption. The most important limiting factor for the use of levodopa is the emergence of motor complications. These are related to a number of factors including the dose of levodopa and the duration of its use."
"The development of a neuroprotective therapy that slows, stops, or reverses neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) is the single most important unresolved issue in the management of this disorder. Current therapies provide effective control of symptoms, particularly in the early stages of the disease, but disease progression is associated with the development of ""nondopaminergic"" features such as postural instability, falling, and dementia that are not adequately controlled with existing medications. There are many promising candidate neuroprotective agents based on pathological and laboratory studies, but to date, it has not been possible to determine that any drug has a disease-modifying effect in PD. Obstacles to the development of a neuroprotective therapy in PD include: (1) uncertainty as to the precise cause of cell death in PD and what to target; (2) the lack of an animal model of PD that precisely reflects the etiopathogenesis of the disease, the pattern of dopaminergic and nondopaminergic pathology, and its chronic, progressive nature; (3) determination of the correct dose to use in clinical trials; and (4) delineation of a clinical end point that is an accurate measure of the underlying disease and is not confounded by potential symptomatic effects of a study intervention. New developments in understanding the cause of the disease, in the development of animal models of PD, and in clinical trial methodology will hopefully hasten the resolution of these problems."
"The period immediately before the onset of motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) often has a recognizable phenotype with features including autonomic dysfunction and impaired olfaction. Subclinical dopaminergic cell loss can also be detected at this time using molecular imaging techniques. A greater recognition of the features of premotor PD and improvements in screening technologies have opened the possibility of predictive testing for PD. In addition to molecular imaging of the dopamine system, screening tests that can potentially be used to identify the physiological abnormalities in premotor PD include olfactory testing, imaging of the sympathetic innervation of the heart, transcranial ultrasound, and genetic testing for mutations known to cause hereditary PD. All of these technologies have trade-offs as screening tests for accuracy, availability, and costs. Using these tests in combination may produce a more favorable combination of reasonable cost and accuracy than using any single test alone. Ultimately, the value of screening for PD depends on development of neuroprotective treatments for PD that would create an imperative for early identification and treatment."
"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease. Traditionally, attention has focused on the motor symptomatology of PD, but it is now appreciated that the nonmotor symptoms affecting neuropsychiatric, sleep, autonomic, and sensory domains occur in up to 88% of PD patients and can be an important source of disability. Nonmotor manifestations of PD play a significant role in the impairment of disease-related quality of life. The cause of nonmotor manifestations of PD is multifactorial, but to a large extent, these manifestations are related to the nature of the neurodegenerative process and the widespread nondopaminergic neuropathological changes associated with the disease. Recognition of nonmotor disability is essential not only for ascertaining the functional status of patients but also for better appreciating the nature of the neurodegenerative process in PD. In addition, a number of nonmotor manifestations can precede the onset of motor symptoms in PD and can be used as screening tools allowing for early disease identification and for trials of possible disease-modifying interventions. This article reviews depression, sleep, and autonomic dysfunction in PD."
"The experimental field of restorative neurology continues to advance with implantation of cells or transfer of genes to treat patients with neurological disease. Both strategies have generated a consensus that demonstrates their capacity for structural and molecular brain modification in the adult brain. However, both approaches have yet to successfully address the complexities to make such novel therapeutic modalities work in the clinic. Prior experimental cell transplantation to patients with PD utilized dissected pieces of fetal midbrain tissue, containing mixtures of cells and neuronal types, as donor cells. Stem cell and progenitor cell biology provide new opportunities for selection and development of large batches of specific therapeutic cells. This may allow for cell composition analysis and dosing to optimize the benefit to an individual patient. The biotechnology used for cell and gene therapy for treatment of neurological disease may eventually be as advanced as today's pharmaceutical drug-related design processes. Current gene therapy phase 1 safety trials for PD include the delivery of a growth factor (neurturin via the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor) and a transmitter enzyme (glutamic acid decarboxylase and aromatic acid decarboxylase). Many new insights from cell biological and molecular studies provide opportunities to selectively express or suppress factors relevant to neuroprotection and improved function of neurons involved in PD. Future gene and cell therapies are likely to coexist with classic pharmacological therapies because their use can be tailored to individual patients' underlying disease process and need for neuroprotective or restorative interventions."
"The pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease is reviewed in light of recent advances in the understanding of the functional organization of the basal ganglia (BG). Current emphasis is placed on the parallel interactions between corticostriatal and corticosubthalamic afferents on the one hand, and internal feedback circuits modulating BG output through the globus pallidus pars interna and substantia nigra pars reticulata on the other. In the normal BG network, the globus pallidus pars externa emerges as a main regulatory station of output activity. In the parkinsonian state, dopamine depletion shifts the BG toward inhibiting cortically generated movements by increasing the gain in the globus pallidus pars externa-subthalamic nucleus-globus pallidus pars interna network and reducing activity in ""direct"" cortico-putaminal-globus pallidus pars interna projections. Standard pharmacological treatments do not mimic the normal physiology of the dopaminergic system and, therefore, fail to restore a functional balance between corticostriatal afferents in the so-called direct and indirect pathways, leading to the development of motor complications. This review emphasizes the concept that the BG can no longer be understood as a ""go-through"" station in the control of movement, behavior, and emotions. The growing understanding of the complexity of the normal BG and the changes induced by DA depletion should guide the development of more efficacious therapies for Parkinson's disease."
"Functional models of Parkinson's disease (PD) have led to effective treatment for the motor symptoms. Toxin-based models, such as the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated primate, have resulted in novel dopaminergic therapies and new therapeutic strategies. They have also been used to study processes underlying motor complications, particularly dyskinesia, and for developing pharmacological approaches to dyskinesia avoidance and suppression. Symptomatic models of PD based on nigrostriatal degeneration have a high degree of predictability of clinical effect of dopaminergic drugs on motor symptoms in humans. However, the effects of nondopaminergic drugs in these models do not translate effectively into clinical efficacy. Newer experimental models of PD have attempted to reproduce the pathogenic process and to involve all areas of the brain pathologically affected in humans. In addition, models showing progressive neuronal death have been sought but so far unsuccessfully. Pathogenic modeling has been attempted using a range of toxins, as well as through the use of transgenic models of gene defects in familial PD and mutant rodent strains. However, there are still no accepted progressive models of PD that mimic the processes known to occur during cell death and that result in the motor deficits, pathology, biochemistry, and drug responsiveness as seen in humans. Nevertheless, functional models of PD have led to many advances in treating the motor symptoms of the disorder, and we have been fortunate to have them available. They are an important reason the treatment of PD is so much better compared with treatments for related illnesses."
"Evidence supports a pathogenic role for free radical injury to brain in Alzheimer's disease; however, clinical trial results are only mildly encouraging. Examining brains from The Adult Changes in Thought study offers a unique perspective. Selectively increased free radical damage to cerebral cortex was associated with Alzheimer's disease, microvascular brain injury, and current smoking, but not with antioxidant supplement usage. Our results support suppression of free radical injury to brain as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease and microvascular brain injury; however, future clinical trials should consider other antioxidants or doses than those identified in our study."
"Three siblings with metachromatic leukodystrophy underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation at different stages of disease. Neuroimaging, nerve conduction studies, neurological examinations, and neuropsychological examinations were used to measure outcome over 2 years. After transplant, the oldest sibling experienced disease progression. His two siblings had near or total resolution of signal abnormalities on neuroimaging. Their neuropsychological testing remained stable, and nerve conduction studies have shown improvement. These results indicate pretransplantation neurological examinations may be the most significant predictor of outcome after transplant. To our knowledge, this report is the first to document neurological outcome of metachromatic leukodystrophy treated by umbilical cord blood transplantation."
"Imaging of cerebrovascular beta-amyloid (cerebral amyloid angiopathy) is complicated by the nearly universal overlap of this pathology with Alzheimer's pathology. We performed positron emission tomographic imaging with Pittsburgh Compound B on 42-year-old man with early manifestations of Iowa-type hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a form of the disorder with little or no plaque deposits of fibrillar beta-amyloid. The results demonstrated increased Pittsburgh Compound B retention selectively in occipital cortex, sparing regions typically labeled in Alzheimer's disease. These results offer compelling evidence that Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography can noninvasively detect isolated cerebral amyloid angiopathy before overt signs of tissue damage such as hemorrhage or white matter lesions."
"The anatomical basis of conscious experience has traditionally been linked to sensory-fugal (inward) pathways that convey sensory information to progressively ""higher"" association cortices. Current thinking is emphasizing the importance of sensory-petal pathways that run in the opposite (outward) direction. According to emerging views, many aspects of cognition may represent an iterative neural dialogue between sensory-fugal connections, which reflect the physical nature of ambient events, and sensory-petal connections, which infer the nature of the stimulus based on empirical accounts of past experience. These reciprocal pathways, embedded within the internally generated oscillations of the brain, are further modulated by top-down projections from high-order association cortices, most prominently located in prefrontal cortex. This set of top-down projections has the capacity to transcend experience-based representations and to insert internally generated priorities into the interpretation of ongoing events. The characteristically human capacity for resisting stimulus-bound responses and favoring novel interpretations may be linked to the influence of these top-down projections. The reciprocal sensory-processing pathways and their top-down modulations collectively define the conscious interpretation of experience."
"Braak and colleagues have proposed that, within the central nervous system, Parkinson's disease (PD) begins as a synucleinopathy in nondopaminergic structures of the lower brainstem or in the olfactory bulb. The brainstem synucleinopathy is postulated to progress rostrally to affect the substantia nigra and cause parkinsonism at a later stage of the disease. In the context of a diagnosis of PD, made from current clinical criteria, the pattern of lower brainstem involvement accompanying mesencephalic synucleinopathy is often observed. However, outside of that context, the patterns of synucleinopathy that Braak described are often not observed, particularly in dementia with Lewy bodies and when synucleinopathy occurs in the absence of neurological manifestations. The concept that lower brainstem synucleinopathy represents ""early PD"" rests on the supposition that it has a substantial likelihood of progressing within the human lifetime to involve the mesencephalon, and thereby cause the substantia nigra pathology and clinical parkinsonism that have heretofore defined the disease. However, the predictive validity of this concept is doubtful, based on numerous observations made in populations of aged individuals who, despite the absence of neurological signs, have brain synucleinopathy ranging up to Braak stages 4 to 6 at postmortem. Furthermore, there is no relation between Braak stage and the clinical severity of PD. We conclude that the relation between patterns of abnormal synuclein immunostaining in the human brain and the disease entity now recognized as PD remains to be determined."
"The mechanisms involved in selective motor neuron degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis remain unknown more than 135 years after the disease was first described. Although most cases have no known cause, mutations in the gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have been implicated in a fraction of familial cases of the disease. Transgenic mouse models with mutations in the SOD1 gene and other ALS genes develop pathology reminiscent of the disorder, including progressive death of motor neurons, and have provided insight into the pathogenesis of the disease but have consistently failed to predict therapeutic efficacy in humans. However, emerging research has demonstrated that mutations and pathology associated with the TDP-43 gene and protein may be more common than SOD1 mutations in familial and sporadic ALS. Putative mechanisms of toxicity targeting motor neurons include oxidative damage, accumulation of intracellular aggregates, mitochondrial dysfunction, defects in axonal transport, growth factor deficiency, aberrant RNA metabolism, glial cell pathology, and glutamate excitotoxicity. Convergence of these pathways is likely to mediate disease onset and progression."
"It is now possible to slow the disease progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but documented improvement in the quality of life of ALS patients has been difficult to quantitate. Putative mechanisms involved in motor neuron degeneration in ALS include oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, growth factor deficiency, and glutamate excitotoxicity. Several pharmacological agents that target these potential targets have demonstrated therapeutic potential in animal models with mutations in the gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Many treatments that have been moderately effective in this animal model have not been successfully translated into effective treatments for humans with ALS. Only the glutamate modulator riluzole has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials and is approved for treating ALS. Combination treatments may represent a potential therapeutic strategy to more robustly prolong life and preserve function, but only vitamin E with riluzole has been formally studied in clinical trials, and to date, no combination treatments have been found to be more effective than currently available single agents."
"Recognition of the early symptoms and signs in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, exclusion of alternative diagnoses, and referral to a tertiary center can have a significant positive impact on the lives of patients and their caregivers. This article provides the most current amyotrophic lateral sclerosis criteria, as well as helpful clinical clues to the diagnosis. An approach to laboratory testing, electrodiagnostic testing, and imaging to exclude diseases that mimic ALS also are discussed, as are atypical presentations that can confound timely diagnosis."
"Currently, there is no proven neuroprotective or neurorestorative therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). Several advances in the genetics of PD have created an opportunity to develop mechanistic-based therapies that hold particular promise for identifying agents that slow and even halt the progression of PD, as well as restore function. Here we review many of the advances in the last decade regarding the identification of new targets for the treatment of PD based on understanding the molecular mechanisms of how mutations in genes linked to PD cause neurodegeneration."
"Protein translation ends when a stop codon in a gene's messenger RNA transcript enters the ribosomal A site. Mutations that create premature stop codons (nonsense mutations) typically cause premature translation termination. An alternative outcome, read-through translation (or nonsense suppression), is well known in prokaryotic, viral, and yeast genes but has not been clearly documented in humans except in the context of pharmacological manipulations. Here, we identify and characterize native read-through of a nonsense mutation (R201X) in the human copper transport gene, ATP7A. Western blotting, in vitro expression analyses, immunohistochemistry, and yeast complementation assays using cultured fibroblasts from a classic Menkes disease patient all indicated small amounts of native ATP7A(R201X) read-through and were associated with a dramatic clinical response to early copper treatment."
"Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease is an X-linked hypomyelinatiing leukodystrophy. We report mutations in the thyroid hormone transporter gene MCT8 in 11% of 53 families affected by hypomyelinating leukodystrophies of unknown aetiology. The 12 MCT8 mutated patients express initially a Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-Like disease phenotype with a latter unusual improvement of magnetic resonance imaging white matter signal despite absence of clinical progression. This observation underlines the interest of determining both free T3 and free T4 serum concentrations to screen for MCT8 mutations in young patients (&lt;3 y) with a severe Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-Like disease presentation or older severe mentally retarded male patients with ""hypomyelinated"" regions."
"We are in the midst of a revolution in the genomic sciences that will forever change the way we view biology and medicine, particularly with respect to brain form, function, development, evolution, plasticity, neurological disease pathogenesis and neural regenerative potential. The application of epigenetic principles has already begun to identify and characterize previously unrecognized molecular signatures of disease latency, onset and progression, mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis, and responses to new and evolving therapeutic modalities. Moreover, epigenomic medicine promises to usher in a new era of neurological therapeutics designed to promote disease prevention and recovery of seemingly lost neurological function via reprogramming of stem cells, redirecting cell fate decisions and dynamically modulating neural network plasticity and connectivity."
"Complex regional pain syndrome is a refractory pain condition with few tested therapies. We hypothesized that botulinum toxin A (BTA) would prolong analgesia after sympathetic blocks in patients with complex regional pain syndrome. We compared the duration of standard lumbar sympathetic block (LSB) with bupivacaine to LSB with bupivacaine and BTA in nine patients with refractory complex regional pain syndrome. Median time to analgesic failure was 71 (95% confidence interval, 12-253) days after LSB with BTA compared with fewer than 10 days (95% confidence interval, 0-12) after standard LSB (log-rank, p &lt; 0.02). BTA profoundly prolonged the analgesia from sympathetic block in this preliminary study."
"Reliable and well-validated biomarkers for PD to identify individuals ""at risk"" before motor symptoms, accurately diagnose individuals at the threshold of clinical PD, and monitor PD progression throughout its course would dramatically accelerate research into both PD cause and therapeutics. Biomarkers offer the potential to provide a window onto disease mechanism, potentially generating therapeutic targets for disease. In particular, biomarkers enable investigation of the premotor period of PD before typical symptoms are manifest, but while degeneration has already begun. Given the multiple genetic causes for PD already identified, the marked variability in the loss of dopaminergic markers measured by imaging at motor symptom onset and the clear heterogeneity of clinical symptoms in PD onset and clinical progression, it is likely many biomarkers with a focus ranging from clinical symptoms to PD pathobiology to molecular genetic mechanisms will be necessary to fully map PD risk and progression. Biomarkers are also critical in new drug development for PD, both in early validation studies to assess drug dosing and to determine drug penetrance into the brain, and in later efficacy studies to complement PD clinical outcomes. During the past two decades, much progress has been made in identifying and assessing PD biomarkers, but as yet, no fully validated biomarker for PD is currently available. Nonetheless, there is increasing evidence that molecular genetics, focused -omic (proteomic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic) assessment of blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and advanced in vivo brain imaging will provide critical clues to assist in the diagnosis and medical management of PD patients."
"Herpesvirions and varicella zoster virus (VZV) DNA were recently reported in all 15 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) obtained within 1 week of exacerbation. Using identical electron microscopic and polymerase chain reaction techniques, including additional primer sets representing different regions of the VZV genome, we found no herpesvirions or VZV DNA in MS CSF or acute MS plaques. Although enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis demonstrated a higher titer of VZV antibody in MS CSF than in inflammatory control samples, recombinant antibodies prepared from clonally expanded MS CSF plasma cells did not bind to VZV. VZV is not a disease-relevant antigen in MS."
"TDP-43 (TAR-DNA binding protein) aggregates in neuronal inclusions in motoneuron disease (MND), as well as in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and FTLD associated with MND (FTLD-MND). Mutations in TARDBP gene, coding for TDP-43, were found in patients with pure MND. We now describe TARDBP mutations in two patients with FTLD-MND, presenting with a behavioral variant of FTLD and semantic dementia, suggesting that TDP-43 may also have a direct pathogenic role in FTLD disorders."
"A systematic autonomic dysfunction observed among patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) has recently attracted close attention. Here, we compare cardiovascular and pulmonary autonomic functions among patients with DLB, patients with Alzheimer's disease, and healthy control subjects. All 15 DLB patients demonstrated severely low ventilatory response to hypercapnia, whereas none of the other subjects demonstrated abnormal results. The majority of the DLB patients showed impaired heart rate variability, low uptake on (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy, and orthostatic hypotension. Ventilatory response to hypercapnia as a marker of respiratory autonomic function is a promising diagnostic tool for DLB."
"There are few data on platelet function in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We prospectively enrolled 69 patients with ICH and measured platelet function on admission. Aspirin use before ICH was associated with reduced platelet activity. Less platelet activity was associated with intraventricular hemorrhage (516.5 [interquartile range (IQR), 454-629.25] vs 637 [IQR, 493-654] aspirin reaction units; p = 0.04) and death at 14 days (480.5 [IQR, 444.5-632.5] vs 626 [IQR, 494-652] aspirin reaction units; p = 0.04). Objective measures of platelet function on admission are associated with intraventricular hemorrhage and death after ICH."
"The polyomavirus JC (JCV) is the causative agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and of JCV granule cell neuronopathy. We present a human immunodeficiency virus-negative patient who experienced development of multiple cortical lesions, aphasia, and progressive cognitive decline after chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer. Brain biopsy and cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction demonstrated JCV, and she had a rapidly fatal outcome. Postmortem analysis showed diffuse cortical lesions and areas of necrosis at the gray-white junction. Immunostaining showed a productive JCV infection of cortical pyramidal neurons, confirmed by electron microscopy, with limited demyelination. This novel gray matter syndrome expands the scope of JCV clinical presentation and pathogenesis."
"Sporadic inclusion body myositis is the commonest acquired disease of skeletal muscles after 50 years of age, and as such it has commanded a great deal of attention of investigators over the past 25 years. As a result, a large amount of information has accumulated concerning its clinical profile, myopathology, and immunopathology. In the myopathology and immunopathology, there is general agreement that the characteristic features could be divided into a degenerative and an inflammatory group. However, there has been controversy about the possible role of these changes in the pathogenesis of muscle fiber damage. In particular, there is no agreement whether a cause-and-effect relationship exists between these two groups of changes, and if so, which is the primary one. In this brief overview, we examine the validity of the various controversial observations and critically review the justification for the two major hypotheses for the primary role of inflammation versus degeneration."
"We performed high-resolution in vitro proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on cerebrospinal fluid and urine samples of 44 patients with leukodystrophies of unknown cause. Free sialic acid concentration was increased in cerebrospinal fluid of two siblings with mental retardation and mild hypomyelination. By contrast, urinary excretion of free sialic acid in urine was normal on repeated testing by two independent methods. Both patients were homozygous for the K136E mutation in SLC17A5, the gene responsible for the free sialic acid storage diseases. Our findings demonstrate that mutations in the SLC17A5 gene have to be considered in patients with hypomyelination, even in the absence of sialuria."
"We sequenced genes coding for components of the SNARE complex (STX1A, VAMP2, SNAP25) and their regulatory proteins (STXBP1/Munc18-1, SYT1), which are essential for neurotransmission, in 95 patients with idiopathic mental retardation. We identified de novo mutations in STXBP1 (nonsense, p.R388X; splicing, c.169+1G&gt;A) in two patients with severe mental retardation and nonsyndromic epilepsy. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and sequencing showed that the splicing mutation creates a stop codon downstream of exon-3. No de novo or deleterious mutations in STXBP1 were found in 190 control subjects, or in 142 autistic patients. These results suggest that STXBP1 disruption is associated with autosomal dominant mental retardation and nonsyndromic epilepsy."
"The introduction of newer therapies for the treatment of multiple sclerosis has generated considerable optimism. That optimism has been tempered by the potential risks of these therapies, such as the risk for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. A review of the possible causes of reactivation of JC virus in this population has illustrated the need to better understand the untoward effects of monoclonal antibody therapies and other immunomodulatory therapies currently being contemplated for use in multiple sclerosis. These drugs alter the immune response at different sites, and most, if not all, affect more than one aspect of host immunity. Drawing from existing experience with the use of these immunomodulatory therapies in other conditions and that available from the limited experience with multiple sclerosis, we review their potential untoward effects. The latter include a predisposition to opportunistic and community-acquired infections, an altered response to vaccination, the development of cancers, and the appearance of autoimmune diseases. The identification of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy as a risk of therapy is relatively straightforward in light of its rarity and high morbidity and mortality, but a relatively slight increased risk for more common and less disabling disorders may be overlooked. Determining the actual risk frequency for many of these complications will likely require careful postmarketing surveillance."
"Animal studies suggest that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is governed by the interaction of REM-promoting and REM-inhibiting nuclei in the pontomesencephalic tegmentum. The pedunculopontine nucleus is proposed to be REM promoting. Using polysomnography, we studied sleep in five parkinsonian patients undergoing unilateral pedunculopontine nucleus deep brain stimulation (DBS). We demonstrated a near doubling of nocturnal REM sleep between the DBS ""off"" and DBS ""on"" states, without significant changes in other sleep states. This represents the first demonstration that DBS can selectively modulate human sleep, and it supports an important role for the pedunculopontine nucleus region in modulating human REM sleep. Ann Neurol 2009;66:110-114."
"Recent advances in molecular biology, neurobiology, genetics, and imaging have demonstrated important insights about the nature of neurological diseases. However, a comprehensive understanding of their pathogenesis is still lacking. Although reductionism has been successful in enumerating and characterizing the components of most living organisms, it has failed to generate knowledge on how these components interact in complex arrangements to allow and sustain two of the most fundamental properties of the organism as a whole: its fitness, also termed its robustness, and its capacity to evolve. Systems biology complements the classic reductionist approaches in the biomedical sciences by enabling integration of available molecular, physiological, and clinical information in the context of a quantitative framework typically used by engineers. Systems biology employs tools developed in physics and mathematics such as nonlinear dynamics, control theory, and modeling of dynamic systems. The main goal of a systems approach to biology is to solve questions related to the complexity of living systems such as the brain, which cannot be reconciled solely with the currently available tools of molecular biology and genomics. As an example of the utility of this systems biological approach, network-based analyses of genes involved in hereditary ataxias have demonstrated a set of pathways related to RNA splicing, a novel pathogenic mechanism for these diseases. Network-based analysis is also challenging the current nosology of neurological diseases. This new knowledge will contribute to the development of patient-specific therapeutic approaches, bringing the paradigm of personalized medicine one step closer to reality."
"Multiple sclerosis is (MS) a T-cell autoimmune disease characterized by a relapsing-remitting followed by a progressive phase. Relapses are driven by the adaptive immune system and involve waves of T helper cell 1 (Th1), Th17, and CD8 cells that infiltrate the nervous system and provoke a attack. These cells are modulated by regulatory T and B cells. Infiltration of T cells into the nervous system initiates a complex immunological cascade consisting of epitope spreading, which triggers new attacks, and activation of the innate immune system (microglia, dendritic cells, astrocytes, B cells), which leads to chronic inflammation. The secondary progressive phase is due to neurodegeneration triggered by inflammation and is driven by the innate immune system. Why a shift to the progressive stage occurs and how to prevent it is a central question in MS. Effective treatment of MS must affect multiple disease pathways: suppression of proinflammatory T cells, induction of regulatory T cells, altering traffic of cells into the nervous system, protecting axons and myelin, and controlling innate immune responses. Without biomarkers, the clinical and pathological heterogeneity of MS makes treatment difficult. Treatment is further hampered by untoward adverse effects caused by immune suppression. Nonetheless, major progress has been made in the understanding and treatment of MS. There are three definitions of cure as it applies to MS: (1) halt progression of disease, (2) reverse neurological deficits, and (3) prevent MS. Although the pathways to each of these cures are linked, each requires a unique strategy."
"Hand clapping is a motor program mastered in infancy. Inspired by a question posed by an Eastchester High School AP Psychology class, we present a case series of 14 patients with hemispatial neglect who, when asked to clap, repeatedly performed one-handed motions stopping abruptly at the midline of the visual hemispace, as if pantomiming slapping an invisible board. In contrast, hemiplegic patients without neglect will reach across and clap against their plegic hands. This phenomenon provides an easy, rapid, and unambiguous test for neglect, applicable to patients of any ethnicity or age. Ann Neurol 2009;66:114-117."
"X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is the most common inherited peroxisomal disorder characterized by a progressive demyelination of the central nervous system. The marked loss of myelin and oligodendrocytes observed in the disease prompted us to evaluate the therapeutic potential of insulin-like growth factor-1 and neurotrophin-3, two potent inducers of myelin formation and oligodendrocyte survival. Viral vectors engineered to produce insulin-like growth factor-1 or neurotrophin-3 were administrated into the cerebrospinal fluid of an X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy mouse model. We show that viral-based, long-lasting delivery of insulin-like growth factor-1 and neurotrophin-3 significantly halts the progression of the disease and leads to potent protective effect against the demyelination process. Ann Neurol 2009;66:117-122."
"To test whether the synucleinopathies Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy (MSA) share a common genetic etiology, we performed a candidate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association study of the 384 most associated SNPs in a genome-wide association study of Parkinson's disease in 413 MSA cases and 3,974 control subjects. The 10 most significant SNPs were then replicated in additional 108 MSA cases and 537 controls. SNPs at the SNCA locus were significantly associated with risk for increased risk for the development of MSA (combined p = 5.5 x 10(-12); odds ratio 6.2) [corrected]."
"Migraine continues to be an elephant in the room of medicine: massively common and a heavy burden on patients and their healthcare providers, yet the recipient of relatively little attention for research, education, and clinical resources. Its visibility is gradually increasing, however, as advances in genetics, imaging, epidemiology, and pharmacology produce a more definitive understanding of the condition, and identify more specific and effective treatments. Rapid evolution of concepts regarding its prevalence, pathophysiology, and clinical management is leading to growing recognition of migraine as a fundamentally important disorder of the nervous system."
"Neurologist S. Weir Mitchell first described ""causalgia"" following wartime nerve injury, with its persistent distal limb burning pain, swelling, and abnormal skin color, temperature, and sweating. Similar post-traumatic symptoms were later identified in patients without overt nerve injuries after trauma. This was labeled reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD; now complex regional pain syndrome type I [CRPS-I]). The pathophysiology of symptoms is unknown and treatment options are limited. We propose that persistent RSD/CRPS-I is a post-traumatic neuralgia associated with distal degeneration of small-diameter peripheral axons. Small-fiber lesions are easily missed on examination and are undetected by standard electrophysiological testing. Most CRPS features-spreading pain and skin hypersensitivity, vasomotor instability, osteopenia, edema, and abnormal sweating-are explicable by small-fiber dysfunction. Small fibers sense pain and temperature but also regulate tissue function through neuroeffector actions. Indeed, small-fiber-predominant polyneuropathies cause CRPS-like abnormalities, and pathological studies of nerves from chronic CRPS-I patients confirm small-fiber-predominant pathology. Small distal nerve injuries in rodents reproduce many CRPS features, further supporting this hypothesis. CRPS symptoms likely reflect combined effects of axonal degeneration and plasticity, inappropriate firing and neurosecretion by residual axons, and denervation supersensitivity. The resulting tissue edema, hypoxia, and secondary central nervous system changes can exacerbate symptoms and perpetuate pathology. Restoring the interest of neurologists in RSD/CRPS should improve patient care and broaden our knowledge of small-fiber functions."
"We aimed to identify neuroanatomical regions associated with deficits to the graphemic buffer, a working memory component of the spelling system that holds the sequence of letter identities during production. We evaluated 331 patients with left hemisphere ischemic stroke with various spelling tests and magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging and perfusion-weighted imaging, within 48 hours of stroke onset. A voxel-wise statistical map showed that ischemia in voxels in posterior and inferior frontal and parietal cortex, subcortical white matter underlying prefrontal cortex, lateral occipital gyrus, or caudate was associated with impairment in maintaining the sequence of letter identities while spelling."
"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is caused by deposition of the amyloid beta protein in the cerebral vasculature. In analogy to previous observations in Alzheimer disease, we hypothesized that analysis of amyloid beta(40) and beta(42) proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid might serve as a molecular biomarker. We observed strongly decreased cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta(40) (p &lt; 0.01 vs controls or Alzheimer disease) and amyloid beta(42) concentrations (p &lt; 0.001 vs controls and p &lt; 0.05 vs Alzheimer disease) in cerebral amyloid angiopathy patients. The combination of amyloid beta(42) and total tau discriminated cerebral amyloid angiopathy from controls, with an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.98. Our data are consistent with neuropathological evidence that amyloid beta(40) as well as amyloid beta(42) protein are selectively trapped in the cerebral vasculature from interstitial fluid drainage pathways that otherwise transport amyloid beta proteins toward the cerebrospinal fluid."
"Astrocyte infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is considered rare, so astrocytes are thought to play a secondary role in HIV neuropathogenesis. By combining double immunohistochemistry, laser capture microdissection, and highly sensitive multiplexed polymerase chain reaction to detect HIV DNA in single astrocytes in vivo, we showed that astrocyte infection is extensive in subjects with HIV-associated dementia, occurring in up to 19% of GFAP+ cells. In addition, astrocyte infection frequency correlated with the severity of neuropathological changes and proximity to perivascular macrophages. Our data indicate that astrocytes can be extensively infected with HIV, and suggest an important role for HIV-infected astrocytes in HIV neuropathogenesis."
"Absence epilepsies of childhood are heterogeneous with most cases following complex inheritance. Those cases with onset before 4 years of age represent a poorly studied subset. We screened 34 patients with early-onset absence epilepsy for mutations in SLC2A1, the gene encoding the GLUT1 glucose transporter. Mutations leading to reduced protein function were found in 12% (4/34) of patients. Two mutations arose de novo, and two were familial. These findings suggest GLUT1 deficiency underlies a significant proportion of early-onset absence epilepsy, which has both genetic counseling and treatment implications because the ketogenic diet is effective in GLUT1 deficiency."
"Elevations in beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) levels after traumatic brain injury (TBI) may confer risk for developing Alzheimer's disease in head trauma patients. We investigated the effects of simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, on hippocampal A beta burden in a clinically relevant head injury/intervention model using mice expressing human A beta. Simvastatin therapy blunted TBI-induced increases in A beta, reduced hippocampal tissue damage and microglial activation, and improved behavioral outcome. The ability of statins to reduce post-injury A beta load and ameliorate pathological sequelae of brain injury makes them potentially effective in reducing the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in TBI patients."
"Traditionally, autoimmune pathogeneses have been attributed to CD4(+) T lymphocytes, as in multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and/or to B lymphocytes, as in myasthenia gravis and systemic lupus erythematosus. That is because their primary genetic associations are mostly with certain human leukocyte antigen class II alleles, whose gene products present antigens to CD4(+) T cells. Because few autoimmune diseases show stronger associations with major histocompatibility complex class I alleles (ankylosing spondylitis, Beh&#xe7;et's disease, and psoriasis), CD8(+) T cells, which interact with major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, have been largely ignored in autoimmunity research. However, a variety of findings has recently revived interest in this population, particularly in MS. First, it shows associations with major histocompatibility complex class I alleles. Second, its lesions show a predominance of CD8(+) T cells. Third, these represent effectors that can directly damage central nervous system target cells. Furthermore, several clinical trials of monoclonal antibodies specifically against CD4(+) T cells, or the polarizing cytokines on which they depend, have failed to show any therapeutic benefit in MS, unlike broader-spectrum antibodies that deplete all T cells. Here, we review the evidence that CD8(+) T cells play a role in MS pathogenesis."
"Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for acute ischemic stroke was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1996. Since then it has been severely underutilized. At the time when most practitioners were first being exposed to the literature concerning tPA, there were many concerns about safety and the restrictions on use were quite onerous. Since then a good deal of further work has been done to loosen the restrictions and allay concerns about the risks. The true risk to benefit ratio is far better than is generally realized. Now it is mostly economic problems related to the costs of constantly supplying emergency care that is limiting access. Furthermore, in the current litigious environment, failure to treat is likely to be a more hazardous course of action than legal exposure due to poor outcomes. It must be emphasized that the drug is quite safe and highly effective, and current utilization rates are unacceptably low. Ann Neurol 2009;66:6-10."
"Four patients, aged 7-20 years, suffered from recurrent episodes of flaccid paralysis and encephalopathy associated with bilateral striatal necrosis and chronic progressive polyneuropathy. Using homozygosity mapping, a pathogenic missense mutation in the SLC25A19 gene that encodes the mitochondrial thiamine pyrophosphate transporter was identified. An SLC25A19 mutation was previously reported in Amish congenital lethal microcephaly but the present patients' phenotype is markedly different, with normal head circumference, normal early childhood development, age-appropriate cognitive skills, and normal urinary organic acid profile. Determination of the SLC25A19 sequence should be considered in patients with bilateral striatal necrosis and progressive polyneuropathy."
"Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is presumably mediated by an autoantibody against aquaporin-4 densely expressed at the blood-brain barrier. In 18 patients with NMO, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were systematically reviewed. Brain MRI abnormalities were found for 89% of the patients, and the most prominent feature was ""cloud-like enhancement,"" multiple patchy enhancing lesions with blurred margin, found in 90% of the patients with positive contrast enhancement. In NMO, brain MRI abnormalities are frequent, and cloud-like enhancement appears to be an MRI finding specific to NMO, possibly caused by primary involvement of the blood-brain barrier by the autoantibodies."
"Cerebral developmental venous anomalies are the most frequently encountered cerebral vascular malformation, and as such, are frequently reported as fortuitous findings in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) are generally considered extreme anatomical variations of the cerebral vasculature, and follow a benign clinical course in the vast majority of cases. Here we review current concepts on DVAs with the aim of helping clinicians understand this complex entity. Morphological characteristics that are necessary to conceptualize DVAs are discussed in depth. Images modalities used in diagnosing DVAs are reviewed, including new MRI or CT techniques. Clinical presentation, association with other vascular malformations and cerebral parenchymal abnormalities, and possible physiopathological processes leading to associated imaging or clinical findings are discussed. Atypical forms of DVAs are also reviewed and their clinical significance discussed. Finally, recommendations as to how to manage asymptomatic or symptomatic patients with a DVA are advanced."
"Calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK) belongs to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein family. The members of this protein family function as multiple domain adaptor proteins originally identified at cell junctions and synapses. Insertional mutations or targeted disruption of the CASK gene in mice results in neonatal lethality, indicating an important role for CASK in development. Recently, several reports have also indicated that mutations in the human CASK gene result in X-linked malformations of the brain and mental retardation. At the molecular level, many studies indicate that CASK is critical for synapse formation at both presynaptic and postsynaptic junctions, and in the regulation of gene expression. The known molecular functions of CASK explain, at least partially, mental retardation and brain developmental defects in patients. In this review, recent findings about CASK are summarized and discussed."
"Measuring in vivo spinal cord injury and repair remains elusive. Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) we examined brainstem N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) as a surrogate for spinal cord injury in two mouse strains with different reparative phenotypes following virus-induced demyelination. Swiss Jim Lambert (SJL) and Friend Virus B (FVB) mice progressively demyelinate with axonal loss. FVB mice demyelinate similarly but eventually remyelinate coincident with functional recovery. Brainstem NAA levels drop in both but recover in FVB mice. Chronically infected SJL mice lost 30.5% of spinal cord axons compared to FVB mice (7.3%). In remyelination-enhancing or axon-preserving clinical trials, brainstem MRS may be a viable endpoint to represent overall spinal cord dysfunction."
"The consensus conference on intracranial atherosclerosis provides a comprehensive review of the existing literature relevant to the epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of intracranial atherosclerosis, and identifies principles of management and research priorities. Patients who have suffered a stroke or transient ischemic attack attributed to stenosis (50-99%) of a major intracranial artery face a 12 to 14% risk for subsequent stroke during the 2-year period after the initial ischemic event, despite treatment with antithrombotic medications. The annual risk for subsequent stroke may exceed 20% in high-risk groups. In patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease, short-term and long-term anticoagulation is not superior to antiplatelet treatment. Overall, the subgroup analyses from randomized trials provide evidence about benefit of aggressive atherogenic risk factor management. Intracranial angioplasty with or without stent placement has evolved as a therapeutic option for patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease, particularly those with high-grade stenosis with recurrent ischemic symptoms, medication failure, or both. A multicenter randomized trial is currently under way to compare stent placement with intense medical management for patients with high-grade symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease."
"We sought to identify racial disparities in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). We identified 307 incident PD cases using Pennsylvania State Medicaid claims, and extracted claims for medications, physical therapy, and healthcare visits for the 6 months after diagnosis. After controlling for age, sex, and geography, African-Americans were four times less likely than whites to receive any PD treatment (odds ratio, 0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.64), especially indicated medications. In a group with the same healthcare insurance, disparities in PD treatment exist. Physician and community awareness of these racial differences in PD treatment is the first step in addressing healthcare disparities."
"Cell-based therapies that involve transplantation into the striatum of dopaminergic cells have attracted considerable interest as possible treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, all double-blind, sham-controlled, studies have failed to meet their primary endpoints, and transplantation of dopamine cells derived from the fetal mesencephalon is associated with a potentially disabling form of dyskinesia that persists even after withdrawal of levodopa (off-medication dyskinesia). In addition, disability in advanced patients primarily results from features such as gait dysfunction, freezing, falling, and dementia, which are likely due to nondopaminergic pathology. These features are not adequately controlled with dopaminergic therapies and are thus unlikely to respond to dopaminergic grafts. More recently, implanted dopamine neurons have been found to contain Lewy bodies, suggesting that they are dysfunctional and may have been affected by the PD pathological process. Collectively, these findings do not bode well for the short-term future of cell-based dopaminergic therapies in PD."
"Familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1), a severe migraine with aura variant, is caused by mutations in the CACNA1A gene. Mutant mice carrying the FHM1 R192Q mutation exhibit increased propensity for cortical spreading depression (CSD), a propagating wave of neuroglial depolarization implicated in migraine aura. The CSD phenotype is stronger in female R192Q mutants and diminishes after ovariectomy. Here, we show that orchiectomy reciprocally increases CSD susceptibility in R192Q mutant mice. Chronic testosterone replacement restores CSD susceptibility by an androgen receptor-dependent mechanism. Hence, androgens modulate genetically-enhanced CSD susceptibility and may provide a novel prophylactic target for migraine."
"A 40-year-old man with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) developed primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) after having received 21 doses of natalizumab monotherapy. PCNSL is a disease of the elderly, with the majority of patients being diagnosed in the 7th to 8th decade of life. Immunodeficiency, iatrogenic immunosuppression, and some autoimmune diseases are known as predisposing conditions, and in these patients PCNSL peaks in the 4th decade. Because there is no increased prevalence of PCNSL in MS, and the patient was otherwise not immunocompromised, an association between natalizumab therapy and PCNSL cannot be ruled out."
"Clinical course and prognosis are variable among patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), whereas the extent of axonal degeneration is the major prognostic factor. We studied the effects of sera from CIDP patients on axonal growth in cultured mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons. Compared with control sera, CIDP sera prominently suppressed axonal outgrowth of dorsal root ganglion neurons and shortened axonal length. The inhibitory activity was abolished by adding Y27632, a Rho-kinase inhibitor. These findings suggest that CIDP sera inhibit axonal elongation by Rho-kinase activation, and some serum factors may be responsible for development of axonal degeneration in CIDP."
"Envisioning the future of stroke appears daunting considering the milestones already achieved in stroke imaging. A historical perspective on the developments in stroke care provides a striking narrative of how imaging has transformed diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis of cerebrovascular disorders. Multimodal imaging techniques such as CT and MRI, incorporating parenchymal depictions, illustration of the vasculature, and perfusion data, can provide a wealth of information regarding ischemic pathophysiology. Key elements of ischemic pathophysiology depicted with imaging include vascular occlusion, compensatory collateral flow, resultant hemodynamic conditions that reflect these sources of blood flow, and the neurovascular injury that ensues. The mantra of ""time is brain"" has been perpetuated, but this does not provide an entirely accurate reflection of ischemic pathophysiology and imaging insight shows far more than time alone. Maximizing the potential of perfusion imaging will continue to expand the nascent concept that cerebral ischemia may be completely reversible in certain scenarios. Novel modalities provide a fertile ground for discovery of therapeutic targets and the potential to assess effects of promising strategies. Beyond clinical trials, imaging has become a requisite component of the neurological examination enabling tailored stroke therapy with the use of detailed neuroimaging modalities. In this first article on ischemia, the focus is on the most recent imaging advances and exploring aspects of cerebral ischemia where imaging may yield additional therapeutic strategies. A subsequent article will review recent and anticipated imaging advances in hemorrhage. These thematic overviews underscore that imaging will undoubtedly continue to dramatically shape the future of stroke."
"Over the past decade, molecularly targeted therapies have been added to cytotoxic and antiendocrine drugs in the treatment of cancer, with the aim of targeting the molecular pathways that underlie the carcinogenic process and maintain the cancer phenotype. Success with some of these agents has suggested that identification and validation of drug targets is the starting point for the development of active, safe, and effective drugs. The main molecular targets used to develop anticancer drugs are cell surface receptors, signal transduction pathways, gene transcription targets, ubiquitin-proteasome/heat shock proteins, and tumor microenvironment components. Here, we review the development of the main molecularly targeted noncytotoxic agents studied in glioma, highlighting lessons derived from the development of these novel drugs and proposing new horizons for the clinical development of molecularly targeted therapies."
"Research in multiple sclerosis (MS) has recently been focusing on the extent of neuroaxonal damage and its contribution to disease outcome. In the present study, we examined spinal cord tissue from 30 clinically well-characterized MS patients. MS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and control spinal cord tissue were subjected to morphometric analysis and immunohistochemistry for markers of cell damage and regeneration. Data were related to disease duration and age at death. Here, we present evidence for substantial, nonprogressive neuronal loss on the cervical and lumbar levels early in the disease course of MS. Chromatolytic neurons and immunoreactivity for c-Jun and GAP43 were observed in the ventral gray matter in and adjacent to actively demyelinating lesions, pointing toward neuronal damage and regeneration as an early response to lesion formation."
"Transcranial magnetic resonance (MR)-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (tcMRgHIFU) implies a novel, noninvasive treatment strategy for various brain diseases. Nine patients with chronic neuropathic pain were treated with selective medial thalamotomies. Precisely located thermal ablations of 4mm in diameter were produced at peak temperatures of 51 degrees C to 60 degrees C under continuous visual MR guidance and MR thermometry. The resulting lesions are clearly visible on follow-up MR imaging. All treatments were well tolerated, without side effects or neurological deficits. This is the first report on successful clinical application of tcMRgHIFU in functional brain disorders, portraying it as safe and reliable for noninvasive neurosurgical interventions."
"Encephalitis lethargica (EL) describes an encephalitis with psychiatric, sleep, and extrapyramidal movement disorders. Dyskinetic and parkinsonian forms have been described. EL shares clinical features with the anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR-Ab) encephalitis. We studied 20 sera from pediatric patients with contemporary EL. Ten sera (from 2 males and 8 females, aged 1.3-13 years) and 6/6 cerebrospinal fluid samples were positive for NMDAR-Ab. NMDAR-Ab-positive patients had dyskinesias, agitation, seizures, and insomnia, whereas parkinsonism and somnolence dominated in the NMDAR-Ab-negative children. We were unable to identify any tumors. The dyskinetic form of EL is an NMDAR-Ab encephalitis and can affect very young children."
"Neurological diseases frequently induce pathological changes of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that might secondarily influence brain activity, as the CSF-brain barrier is partially permeable. However, functional effects of CSF on neuronal network activity have not been specified to date. Here, we report that CSF specimens from patients with reduced Glasgow Coma Scale values caused by severe traumatic brain injury suppress synchronous activity of in vitro-generated neuronal networks in comparison with controls. We present evidence that underlying mechanisms include increased N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activity mediated by a CSF fraction containing elevated amino acid concentrations. These proof-of-principle data suggest that determining effects of CSF specimens on neuronal network activity might be of diagnostic value."
"Early in the 20th century during the Russo-Japanese War and World War I (WWI), some of the most important, lasting contributions to clinical neurology were descriptive clinical studies, especially those concerning war-related peripheral nerve disorders (eg, Hoffmann-Tinel sign, Guillain-Barr&#xe9;-Strohl syndrome [GBS]) and occipital bullet wounds (eg, the retinal projection on the cortex by Inouye and later by Holmes and Lister, and the functional partitioning of visual processes in the occipital cortex by Riddoch), but there were also other important descriptive studies concerning war-related aphasia, cerebellar injuries, and spinal cord injuries (eg, cerebellar injuries by Holmes, and autonomic dysreflexia by Head and Riddoch). Later progress, during and shortly after World War II (WWII), included major progress in understanding the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injuries by Denny-Brown, Russell, and Holbourn, pioneering accident injury studies by Cairns and Holbourn, promulgation of helmets to prevent motorcycle injuries by Cairns, development of comprehensive multidisciplinary neurorehabilitation by Rusk, and development of spinal cord injury care by Munro, Guttman, and Bors. These studies and developments were possible only because of the large number of cases that allowed individual physicians the opportunity to collect, collate, and synthesize observations of numerous cases in a short span of time. Such studies also required dedicated, disciplined, and knowledgeable investigators who made the most out of their opportunities to systematically assess large numbers of seriously ill and injured soldiers under stressful and often overtly dangerous situations."
"Little is known about the influence of cerebral white matter lesion (WML) location on gait. We applied partial least squares regression in brain magnetic resonance imaging scans (n = 385) to evaluate which WML voxel systems were independently associated with a composite gait score and identified affected tracts using a diffusion tensor imaging template. Bilateral frontal and periventricular WML-affected voxels corresponding to major anterior projection fibers (thalamic radiations, corticofugal motor tracts) and adjacent association fibers (corpus callosum, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, short association fibers) showed the greatest covariance with poorer gait. WMLs probably contribute to age-related gait decline by disconnecting motor networks served by these tracts."
We report motor cortical function in the left occipital cortex of a subject who suffered a left middle cerebral artery stroke early in development. Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left occipital cortex evoked contraction of right hand muscles. Electroencephalogram recorded over the left occipital cortex showed: 1) coherence with electromyogram from a right hand muscle; 2) a typical sensorimotor Mu rhythm at rest that was suppressed during contraction of right hand muscles. This is the first evidence that cortical plasticity extends beyond reshaping of primary sensory cortical fields to respecification of the cortical origin of subcortically projecting pathways.
"Multicenter clinical research involves parallel Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviews based on the premise that local review reflects aspects of the research environment. We examined the costs and effects of local IRB review of the consent and protocol in a multicenter clinical trial in Parkinson disease. Seventy-six percent of changes to the consent reflected standard institutional language, with no substantive changes to the protocol. The costs of this process exceeded $100,000. These findings support initiatives by the Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to facilitate centralized reviews. This may be an opportune time for the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) to adopt a central review model."
"Chronic, daytime sleepiness is a major, disabling symptom for many patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), but thus far, its etiology is not well understood. Extensive loss of the hypothalamic neurons that produce the wake-promoting neuropeptide hypocretin (orexin) causes the severe sleepiness of narcolepsy, and partial loss of these cells may contribute to the sleepiness of Parkinson disease and other disorders. We have found that the number of hypocretin neurons is significantly reduced in patients with severe TBI. This observation highlights the often overlooked hypothalamic injury in TBI and provides new insights into the causes of chronic sleepiness in patients with TBI."
"We investigated a large German family (n = 37) with male members who had contractures, rigid spine syndrome, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Muscle weakness or atrophy was not prominent in affected individuals. Muscle biopsy disclosed a myopathic pattern with cytoplasmic bodies. We used microsatellite markers and found linkage to a locus at Xq26-28, a region harboring the FHL1 gene. We sequenced FHL1 and identified a new missense mutation within the third LIM domain that replaces a highly conserved cysteine by an arginine (c.625T&gt;C; p.C209R). Our finding expands the phenotypic spectrum of the recently identified FHL1-associated myopathies and widens the differential diagnosis of Emery-Dreifuss-like syndromes."
"Previous studies have indicated a male predominance in pediatric stroke. To elucidate this gender disparity, total testosterone concentration was measured in children with arterial ischemic stroke (AIS; n = 72), children with cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT; n = 52), and 109 healthy controls. Testosterone levels above the 90th percentile for age and gender were documented in 10 children with AIS (13.9%) and 10 with CSVT (19.2%), totaling 16.7% of patients with cerebral thromboembolism overall, as compared with only 2 of 109 controls (1.8%; p = 0.002). In multivariate analysis with adjustment for total cholesterol level, hematocrit, and pubertal status, elevated testosterone was independently associated with increased disease risk (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: overall = 3.98 [1.38-11.45]; AIS = 3.88 [1.13-13.35]; CSVT = 5.50 [1.65-18.32]). Further adjusted analyses revealed that, for each 1nmol/l increase in testosterone in boys, the odds of cerebral thromboembolism were increased 1.3-fold."
"Although Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases predominately affect elderly adults, the proteins that play a role in the pathogenesis of these diseases are expressed throughout life. In fact, many of the proteins hypothesized to be important in the progression of neurodegeneration play direct or indirect roles in the development of the central nervous system. The systems affected by these proteins include neural stem cell fate decisions, neuronal differentiation, cellular migration, protection from oxidative stress, and programmed cell death. Insights into the developmental roles of these proteins may ultimately impact the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases and lead to the discovery of novel treatments."
"The risk for development of multiple sclerosis has been associated with human leukocyte antigen-DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 (HLA-DR15) genotype, low infant sibling exposure, and high Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen IgG levels. In a population-based case-control study (Tasmania, Australia), we found that the combined effect of HLA-DR15 positivity and low infant sibling exposure on multiple sclerosis (odds ratio, 7.88; 95% confidence interval, 3.43-18.11) was 3.9-fold greater than expected (test for interaction, p = 0.019) This interaction was observed irrespective of Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen IgG levels. This suggests that immune mechanisms involving HLA class II molecules are susceptible to modulation in early life. Ann Neurol 2009;66:261-265 ANN NEUROL 2010;67:259-263."
"The neural mechanism by which patients spontaneously recover cognitive function after brain injury is not understood. Here we demonstrate for the first time that aphasic patients, who have largely recovered language function, show increased frontoparietal integration. A similar change in functional connectivity is also observed when normal subjects are exposed to adverse listening conditions. Thus, compensation for inefficient language processing is associated with increased integration between parts of the language network critical to language control. This change reflects greater top-down control of speech comprehension and provides a mechanism by which language impairments after stroke may be compensated for."
"Narcolepsy with cataplexy is a sleep-wake disorder caused by a loss of hypothalamic hypocretins. Here we assessed the time course of amygdala activation during aversive conditioning in unmedicated patients with narcolepsy. Unlike healthy matched control subjects, narcolepsy patients had no enhancement of amygdala response to conditioned stimuli and no increase in functional coupling between the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that human narcolepsy is accompanied by abnormal emotional learning, and that, in line with animal data, the hypocretin system and the amygdala are involved in this process."
Twelve pregnancies in 11 adult women harboring World Health Organization (WHO) grade II gliomas (GIIGs) prior to pregnancy were reviewed to address whether pregnancy affects tumor growth using a quantitative approach of the radiological velocity of diametric expansion (VDE) on successive magnetic resonance images. VDE was significantly increased during pregnancy as compared to prepregnancy (p &lt; 0.001) and to postdelivery (p = 0.012) periods. Pregnancy increases the radiological growth rates of GIIGs. An increase in seizure frequency was observed concomitantly in 40% of cases and further oncological treatment was started after delivery in 25% of cases.
"Sodium channel Na(V)1.7, encoded by the SCN9A gene, is preferentially expressed in nociceptive primary sensory neurons, where it amplifies small depolarizations. In studies on a family with inherited erythromelalgia associated with Na(V)1.7 gain-of-function mutation A863P, we identified a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism within SCN9A in the affected proband and several unaffected family members; this polymorphism (c. 3448C&amp;T, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms database rs6746030, which produces the amino acid substitution R1150W in human Na(V)1.7 [hNa(V)1.7]) is present in 1.1 to 12.7% of control chromosomes, depending on ethnicity. In this study, we examined the effect of the R1150W substitution on function of the hNa(V)1.7 channel, and on the firing of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in which this channel is normally expressed. We show that this polymorphism depolarizes activation (7.9-11mV in different assays). Current-clamp analysis shows that the 1150W allele depolarizes (6mV) resting membrane potential and increases ( approximately 2-fold) the firing frequency in response to depolarization in DRG neurons in which it is present. Our results suggest that polymorphisms in the Na(V)1.7 channel may influence susceptibility to pain."
"We evaluated the arginine growth hormone (GH) stimulation test for the diagnosis of cerebellar-type multiple system atrophy (MSAc) in patients with ataxia. Fourteen subjects with MSAc, 11 with idiopathic late-onset cerebellar ataxia (ILOCA), 10 with familial ataxia, and 10 healthy controls were tested. After pituitary GH deficiency was excluded, subjects underwent arginine testing. Peak serum GH response was analyzed. No significant differences in peak GH response were found between subject populations. Thirty-three percent of MSAc subjects mounted responses &gt;10 microg/l GH. Thirty-six percent of ILOCA subjects and 40 percent of healthy controls mounted responses &lt;4 microg/l GH. Arginine thus appears to be unreliable for the diagnosis of MSAc."
"Physicians use heuristics or shortcuts in their decision making to help them sort through complex clinical information and formulate diagnoses efficiently. Practice would come to a halt without them. However, there are pitfalls to the use of certain heuristics, the same ones to which humans are prone in everyday life. It may be possible to improve clinical decision making through techniques that minimize biases inherent in heuristics. Five common clinical heuristics or other sources of cognitive error are illustrated through neurological cases with missed diagnoses, and literature from cognitive psychology and medicine are presented to support the occurrence of these errors in diagnostic reasoning as general phenomena. Articulation of the errors inherent in certain common heuristics alerts clinicians to their weaknesses as diagnosticians and should be beneficial to practice. Analysis of cases with missed diagnoses in teaching conferences might proceed along formal lines that identify the type of heuristic used and of inherent potential cognitive errors. Addressing these cognitive errors by becoming conscious of them is a useful tool in neurologic education and should facilitate a career-long process of continuous self-improvement."
"The genetic architecture of common epilepsies is largely unknown. HCNs are excellent epilepsy candidate genes because of their fundamental neurophysiological roles. Screening in subjects with febrile seizures and genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus revealed that 2.4% carried a common triple proline deletion (delPPP) in HCN2 that was seen in only 0.2% of blood bank controls. Currents generated by mutant HCN2 channels were approximately 35% larger than those of controls; an effect revealed using automated electrophysiology and an appropriately powered sample size. This is the first association of HCN2 and familial epilepsy, demonstrating gain of function of HCN2 current as a potential contributor to polygenic epilepsy."
"For most of us, the foundations of our understanding of genetics were laid by considering Mendelian diseases in which familial recurrence risks are high, and mutant alleles are both necessary and sufficient. One consequence of this deterministic teaching is that our conceptualization of genetics tends to be dominated by the notion that the genetic aspects of disease are caused by rare alleles exerting large effects. Unfortunately, the preconceptions that flow from this training are frequently erroneous and misleading in the context of common traits, where familial recurrence risks are modest, and for the most part the relevant alleles are neither rare, necessary, nor sufficient. For these common traits, the genetic architecture is far more complex, with susceptibility rather than causality resulting from the combined effects of many alleles, each exerting only a modest effect on risk. None of these alleles is sufficient to cause disease on its own, and none is essential for the development of disease. Furthermore, most are carried by large sections of the population, the vast majority of which does not develop the disease. One consequence of our innate belief in the Mendelian paradigm is that we have an inherent expectation that knowledge about the genetic basis for a disease should allow genetic testing and thereby accurate risk prediction. There is an inevitable feeling that the same should be true in complex disease, but is it?"
"The pedunculopontine nucleus is part of the reticular ascending arousal system and is involved in locomotion and sleep. Two patients with Parkinson disease received electrodes that stimulated the pedunculopontine nucleus area to alleviate their severe gait impairment. Instead, we found that low-frequency stimulation of the pedunculopontine nucleus area increased alertness, whereas high-frequency stimulation induced non-rapid eye movement sleep. In addition, the sudden withdrawal of the low-frequency stimulation was consistently followed by rapid eye movement sleep episodes in 1 patient. These data have the potential to benefit patients who suffer from sleep disorders."
"Most neurodegenerative disorders are thought to result primarily from the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which interfere with protein homeostasis in neurons. For a subset of diseases, however, noncoding regions of RNAs assume a primary toxic gain-of-function, leading to degeneration in many tissues, including the nervous system. Here we review a series of proposed mechanisms by which noncoding repeat expansions give rise to nervous system degeneration and dysfunction. These mechanisms include transcriptional alterations and the generation of antisense transcripts, sequestration of mRNA-associated protein complexes that lead to aberrant mRNA splicing and processing, and alterations in cellular processes, including activation of abnormal signaling cascades and failure of protein quality control pathways. We place these potential mechanisms in the context of known RNA-mediated disorders, including the myotonic dystrophies and fragile X tremor ataxia syndrome, and discuss recent results suggesting that mRNA toxicity may also play a role in some presumably protein-mediated neurodegenerative disorders. Lastly, we comment on recent progress in therapeutic development for these RNA-dominant diseases."
"P2X3 purinoreceptors expressed in mammalian sensory neurons play a key role in several processes, including pain perception. From the venom of the Central Asian spider Geolycosa sp., we have isolated a novel peptide, named purotoxin-1 (PT1), which is to our knowledge the first natural molecule exerting powerful and selective inhibitory action on P2X3 receptors. PT1 dramatically slows down the removal of desensitization of these receptors. The peptide demonstrates potent antinociceptive properties in animal models of inflammatory pain."
"Familial Parkinson disease (PD) due to the A30P mutation in the SNCA gene encoding alpha-synuclein is clinically associated with PD symptoms. In this first pathoanatomical study of the brain of an A30P mutation carrier, we observed neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, locus coeruleus, and dorsal motor vagal nucleus, as well as widespread occurrence of alpha-synuclein immunopositive Lewy bodies, Lewy neurites, and glial aggregates. Alpha-synuclein aggregates ultrastructurally resembled Lewy bodies, and biochemical analyses disclosed a significant load of insoluble alpha-synuclein, indicating neuropathological similarities between A30P disease patients and idiopathic PD, with a more severe neuropathology in A30P carriers."
"To determine whether multiple sclerosis (MS) risk increases following primary infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), we conducted a nested case-control study including 305 individuals who developed MS and 610 matched controls selected among the &gt;8 million active-duty military personnel whose serum has been stored in the Department of Defense Serum Repository. Time of EBV infection was determined by measuring antibody titers in serial serum samples collected before MS onset among cases, and on matched dates among controls. Ten (3.3%) cases and 32 (5.2%) controls were initially EBV negative. All of the 10 EBV-negative cases became EBV positive before MS onset; in contrast, only 35.7% (n = 10) of the 28 controls with follow-up samples seroconverted (exact p value = 0.0008). We conclude that MS risk is extremely low among individuals not infected with EBV, but it increases sharply in the same individuals following EBV infection."
"Herpes simplex virus type 1 is a common cause of severe sporadic encephalitis. Treatment with acyclovir is highly effective in this disease. We report the case of a 27-year-old, immunocompetent woman with acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex encephalitis. Although she had not been treated before, herpes simplex virus type 1 DNA from the cerebrospinal fluid showed a non-synonymous mutation in the thymidine kinase gene, which is likely to have caused resistance to acyclovir. Herpes simplex encephalitis resolved after treatment with foscarnet. To our knowledge, this is the first report of acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus encephalitis in an immunocompetent, previously therapy-naive adult."
"Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by early infantile macrocephaly and delayed motor and cognitive deterioration. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows diffusely abnormal and swollen cerebral white matter and subcortical cysts. On follow-up, atrophy ensues. Approximately 80% of MLC patients have mutations in MLC1. We report 16 MLC patients without MLC1 mutations. Eight retained the classical clinical and MRI phenotype. The other 8 showed major MRI improvement. They lacked motor decline. Five had normal intelligence; 3 displayed cognitive deficiency. In conclusion, 2 phenotypes can be distinguished among the non-MLC1 mutated MLC patients: a classical and a benign phenotype."
"Inhibitory neurosteroids, molecules generated in glia from circulating steroid hormones and de novo from cholesterol, keep seizures in check in epileptic animals. They can enhance inhibitory transmission mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors and have anticonvulsant action."
"We conducted a masked, crossover, therapeutic trial of gabapentin (1,200mg/day) versus memantine (40 mg/day) for acquired nystagmus in 10 patients (aged 28-61 years; 7 female; 3 multiple sclerosis [MS]; 6 post-stroke; 1 post-traumatic). Nystagmus was pendular in 6 patients (4 oculopalatal tremor; 2 MS) and jerk upbeat, hemi-seesaw, torsional, or upbeat-diagonal in each of the others. For the group, both drugs reduced median eye speed (p &lt; 0.001), gabapentin by 32.8% and memantine by 27.8%, and improved visual acuity (p &lt; 0.05). Each patient improved with 1 or both drugs. Side effects included unsteadiness with gabapentin and lethargy with memantine. Both drugs should be considered as treatment for acquired forms of nystagmus."
"Three clustered, homologous paraoxonase genes (PON1, PON2, and PON3) have roles in preventing lipid oxidation and detoxifying organophosphates. Recent reports describe a genetic association between the PON genes and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We now report that in genomic DNA from individuals with familial and sporadic ALS, we have identified at least 7 PON gene mutations that are predicted to alter PON function."
"Despite tremendous growth in recent years in our knowledge of the molecular basis of Parkinson disease (PD) and the molecular pathways of cell injury and death, we remain without therapies that forestall disease progression. Although there are many possible explanations for this lack of success, one is that experimental therapeutics to date have not adequately focused on an important component of the disease process, that of axon degeneration. It remains unknown what neuronal compartment, either the soma or the axon, is involved at disease onset, although some have proposed that it is the axons and their terminals that take the initial brunt of injury. Nevertheless, this concept has not been formally incorporated into many of the current theories of disease pathogenesis, and it has not achieved a wide consensus. More importantly, in view of growing evidence that the molecular mechanisms of axon degeneration are separate and distinct from the canonical pathways of programmed cell death that mediate soma destruction, the possibility of early involvement of axons in PD has not been adequately emphasized as a rationale to explore the neurobiology of axons for novel therapeutic targets. We propose that ongoing degeneration of axons, not cell bodies, is the primary determinant of clinically apparent progression of disease, and that future experimental therapeutics intended to forestall disease progression will benefit from a new focus on the distinct mechanisms of axon degeneration."
"A novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus was recently identified in Mexico. Some cases of infection with neurological complications have been reported to date. We report a case of acute necrotizing encephalopathy associated with the novel H1N1 virus in a 2-year-old European girl who suddenly developed fever, seizures, and altered mental status. Brain and spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral symmetrical lesions of the insulae, thalami, geniculate bodies, and pons tegmentum suggestive of an acute necrotizing encephalopathy. An involvement of meninges and spinal cord was observed configuring an acute necrotizing meningoencephalomyelitis."
"Evidence from well-designed clinical trials may guide clinicians, reduce regional variation, and lead to improved outcomes. Many physicians choose to ignore evidence-based practice guidelines. Using unproven therapies outside of a randomized trial slows recruitment in clinical trials that could yield information on clinical and economic efficacy. Using acute stroke therapy as an illustration, we present an ethical hierarchy for therapeutic decision making during medical emergencies. First, physicians should offer standard care. If no standard care option exists, the physician should consider enrollment in a randomized clinical trial. If no trial is appropriate, the physician should consider a nonrandomized registry, or consensus-based guidelines. Finally, only after considering the first 3 options, the physician should use best judgment based on previous personal experience and any published case series or anecdotes. Given the paucity of quality randomized clinical trial data for most medical decisions, the ""best judgment"" option will be used most frequently. Nevertheless, such a hierarchy is needed because of the limited time during medical emergencies for consideration of general principles of clinical decision making. There should be general agreement in advance as to the hierarchy to follow in selecting treatment for critically ill patients. Were more clinicians to follow this hierarchy, and choose to participate in clinical trials, the generation of new knowledge would accelerate, yielding rigorous data supporting or refuting the efficacy and safety of new interventions more quickly, thus benefiting far more patients over time."
"A chronic state of impaired venous drainage from the central nervous system, termed chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), is claimed to be a pathologic phenomenon exclusively seen in multiple sclerosis (MS). This has invigorated the causal debate of MS and generated immense interest in the patient and scientific communities. A potential shift in the treatment paradigm of MS involving endovascular balloon angioplasty or venous stent placement has been proposed as well as conducted in small patient series. In some cases, it may have resulted in serious injury. In this Point of View, we discuss the recent investigations that led to the description of CCSVI as well as the conceptual and technical shortcomings that challenge the potential relationship of this phenomenon to MS. The need for conducting carefully designed and rigorously controlled studies to investigate CCVSI has been recognized by the scientific bodies engaged in MS research. Several scientific endeavors examining the presence of CCSVI in MS are being undertaken. At present, invasive and potentially dangerous endovascular procedures as therapy for patients with MS should be discouraged until such studies have been completed, analyzed, and debated in the scientific arena."
"Mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonists such as morphine are extremely effective treatments for acute pain. In the setting of chronic pain, however, their long-term utility is limited by the development of tolerance and physical dependence. Drug companies have tried to overcome these problems by simply ""dialing up"" signal transduction at the receptor, designing more potent and efficacious agonists and more long-lasting formulations. Neither of these strategies has proven to be successful, however, because the net amount of signal transduction, particularly over extended periods of drug use, is a product of much more than the pharmacokinetic properties of potency, efficacy, half-life, and bioavailability, the mainstays of traditional pharmaceutical screening. Both the quantity and quality of signal transduction are influenced by many regulated processes, including receptor desensitization, trafficking, and oligomerization. Importantly, the efficiency with which an agonist first stimulates signal transduction is not necessarily related to the efficiency with which it stimulates these other processes. Here we describe recent findings that suggest MOR agonists with diminished propensity to cause tolerance and dependence can be identified by screening drugs for the ability to induce MOR desensitization, endocytosis, and recycling. We also discuss preliminary evidence that heteromers of the delta opioid receptor and the MOR are pronociceptive, and that drugs that spare such heteromers may also induce reduced tolerance."
"This study aimed to determine whether retinal fractal dimension, a quantitative measure of microvascular branching complexity and density, is associated with lacunar stroke. A total of 392 patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke had retinal fractal dimension measured from digital photographs, and lacunar infarct ascertained from brain imaging. After adjusting for age, gender, and vascular risk factors, higher retinal fractal dimension (highest vs lowest quartile and per standard deviation increase) was independently and positively associated with lacunar stroke (odds ratio [OR], 4.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-12.17 and OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.20-2.84, respectively). Increased retinal microvascular complexity and density is associated with lacunar stroke."
"To determine the impact of cortical Alzheimer disease pathology on shunt responsiveness in individuals treated for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), 37 patients clinically diagnosed with iNPH participated in a prospective study in which performance on neurologic, psychometric, and gait measures before and 4 months after shunting was correlated with amyloid &#x3b2; plaques, neuritic plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles observed in cortical biopsies obtained during shunt insertion. No complications resulted from biopsy acquisition. Moderate to severe pathology was associated with worse baseline cognitive performance and diminished postoperative improvement on NPH symptom severity scales, gait measures, and cognitive instruments compared to patients lacking pathology."
"Mutations in the gap junction protein gamma-2 gene, GJC2, cause a central hypomyelinating disorder; Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease (PMLD; MIM311601). Using a homozygosity mapping and positional candidate gene approach, we identified a homozygous mutation (c.-167A&gt;G) within the GJC2 promoter at a potent SOX10 binding site in a patient with mild PMLD. Functionally, this mutation completely abolished the SOX10 binding and attenuated GJC2 promoter activity. These findings suggest not only that the SOX10-to-GJC2 transcriptional dysregulation is a cause of PMLD, but also that GJC2 may be in part responsible for the central hypomyelination caused by SOX10 mutations."
"To investigate the possible efficacy of amantadine in the control of pathological gambling (PG) associated with Parkinson disease (PD), 17 PD patients with PG were randomly selected for a double-blind crossover study with amantadine 200mg/day versus placebo and an open follow-up. Assessments included PG-specific scales (Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale for PG, Gambling-Symptom Assessment Scale, South Oaks Gambling Screen) and assessment of expenditures and time spent gambling. Amantadine abolished or reduced PG in all treated patients, as confirmed by scale score and daily expenditure reduction. Amantadine might be useful to treat PG. The effect of amantadine, acting as an antiglutamatergic agent, also opens new insights into the pathogenesis of PG."
"Peroxisomal biogenesis disorders typically cause severe multisystem disease and early death. We describe a child and an adult of normal intelligence with progressive ataxia, axonal motor neuropathy, and decreased vibration sense. Both patients had marked cerebellar atrophy. Peroxisomal studies revealed a peroxisomal biogenesis disorder. Two mutations in PEX10 were found in the child, c.992G&gt;A (novel) and c.764_765insA, and in the adult, c.2T&gt;C (novel) and c.790C&gt;T. Transfection with wild-type PEX10 corrected the fibroblast phenotype. Bile acid supplements and dietary restriction of phytanic acid were started. Peroxisomal biogenesis disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis of autosomal recessive ataxia."
"Residual tumor cells remain beyond the margins of every glioblastoma (GBM) resection. Their resistance to postsurgical therapy is considered a major driving force of mortality, but their biology remains largely uncharacterized. In this study, residual tumor cells were derived via experimental biopsy of the resection margin after standard neurosurgery for direct comparison with samples from the routinely resected tumor tissue. In vitro analysis of proliferation, invasion, stem cell qualities, GBM-typical antigens, genotypes, and in vitro drug and irradiation challenge studies revealed these cells as unique entities. Our findings suggest a need for characterization of residual tumor cells to optimize diagnosis and treatment of GBM."
"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs) remain among the most common disorders in people infected with HIV, even in an era when potent antiretroviral therapy is widely deployed. This review discusses the clinical features of HANDs and the implications for more effective treatment. With the improved survival of individuals treated with antiretrovirals, comorbid conditions are increasingly salient, including particularly coinfection with hepatitis C and the effects of aging. This review attempts to answer why there appears to be a therapeutic gap between the salutary effects of antiretroviral regimens and normalization of neurological function. A second gap is found in the understanding of the pathophysiology of HANDs. This review addresses this and discusses the animal models that have helped to elucidate these mechanisms. Although triggered by productive HIV infection of brain macrophages, aberrant and sustained immune activation appears to play a major role in inducing HANDs, and may explain the often incomplete neurological response to highly active antiretroviral therapy. Novel therapies aimed at persistent central nervous system inflammation will be needed to close this gap."
"Discussing the problem of multiple sclerosis and viruses should not be limited to reviewing the epidemiological evidence in favor, or against, a particular candidate, such as Epstein-Barr virus or human herpes virus 6. In this text, I discuss the difficulty of going from association to causation in human epidemiology; the fact that viruses can trigger or prevent autoimmunity; the problem of our very limited knowledge of the viruses that we harbor as part of our metagenome; and the role of such viral flora in multifactorial diseases and also, possibly, in health."
"Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are being considered for clinical trials of multiple sclerosis (MS). We examined the effects of adult bone marrow-derived hMSCs on responses of primary human Th1, Th17, and Th1/17 double-expressing T-cell subsets, all implicated in MS. As expected, soluble products from hMSCs inhibited Th1 responses; however, Th17 responses were increased. Secretion of interleukin (IL)-10, considered anti-inflammatory, was decreased. Pretreating hMSCs with the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1&#x3b2; accentuated these effects, and caused decreases in the Th1/17 subset. These findings underscore the importance of further preclinical work and immune-monitoring to define hMSC effects on disease-relevant immune responses under variable conditions."
"Severe excessive autonomic overactivity occurs in a subgroup of people surviving acquired brain injury, the majority of whom show paroxysmal sympathetic and motor overactivity. Delayed recognition of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) after brain injury may increase morbidity and long-term disability. Despite its significant clinical impact, the scientific literature on this syndrome is confusing; there is no consensus on nomenclature, etiological information for diagnoses preceding the condition is poorly understood, and the evidence base underpinning our knowledge of the pathophysiology and management strategies is largely anecdotal. This systematic literature review identified 2 separate categories of paroxysmal autonomic overactivity, 1 characterized by relatively pure sympathetic overactivity and another group of disorders with mixed parasympathetic/sympathetic features. The PSH group comprised 349 reported cases, with 79.4% resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI), 9.7% from hypoxia, and 5.4% from cerebrovascular accident. Although TBI is the dominant causative etiology, there was some suggestion that the true incidence of the condition is highest following cerebral hypoxia. In total, 31 different terms were identified for the condition. Although the most common term in the literature was dysautonomia, the consistency of sympathetic clinical features suggests that a more specific term should be used. The findings of this review suggest that PSH be adopted as a more clinically relevant and appropriate term. The review highlights major problems regarding conceptual definitions, diagnostic criteria, and nomenclature. Consensus on these issues is recommended as an essential basis for further research in the area."
"We investigated the pattern of volitional facial motor deficits in acute stroke patients. We assessed the strength of single facial movements and correlated it to the site of infarct classified on computed tomography scans. Exclusion criteria were previous stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, and subcortical stroke. Results showed that weakness in eyelid closure was associated with anterior cerebral artery (ACA) stroke. Weakness in lip opening was associated with middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. We suggest that sparing of upper facial movements in MCA stroke is due to the presence of an upper face motor representation in both the MCA and ACA territories."
"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) may be an important predisposing factor for the hemorrhagic complications of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) therapy. We studied patients treated within 3 hours of onset of ischemic stroke with rt-PA using positron emission tomography to compare Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) (a cerebral &#x3b2;-amyloid ligand) retention in those with and without parenchymal hemorrhage (PH) and normal controls. Neocortical PiB retention was higher among patients with PH compared with patients without PH and normal controls, suggesting underlying CAA as a predisposing factor for rt-PA-related hemorrhage. This finding may provide an impetus for the development of a more practical rapid pretreatment screening technique."
"It has been suggested that natalizumab-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy may be prevented by structured interruptions of treatment. Evidence supporting such a drug holiday is not yet available. Here we present initial observations in 10 multiple sclerosis patients who were stringently monitored up to 6 months after discontinuation of the infusions. Cumulatively, a combination of clinical relapse and new and/or enhanced lesions on magnetic resonance imaging had occurred in 7 of 10 patients. Although numbers are small, our data suggest that in patients who were switched to natalizumab because of disease activity despite first-line treatment, a natalizumab drug holiday without reinstatement of alternate disease-modifying therapy is poorly tolerated."
"Two families manifesting Glut1 deficiency syndrome (DS) as an autosomal recessive trait are described. In 1 family, a severely affected boy inherited a mutated allele from his asymptomatic heterozygous mother. A de novo mutation developed in the paternal allele, producing compound heterozygosity. In another family, 2 mildly affected sisters inherited mutations from their asymptomatic heterozygous consanguineous parents. Red blood cell glucose uptake residual activity, a surrogate of haploinsufficiency, correlated with the clinical severity. These cases demonstrate that Glut1 DS may present as an autosomal recessive trait. The clinical pattern of inheritance is determined by the relative pathogenicity of the mutation and the resulting degree of haploinsufficiency."
"Advanced cerebrovascular &#x3b2;-amyloid deposition (cerebral amyloid angiopathy, CAA) is associated with cerebral microbleeds, but the precise relationship between CAA burden and microbleeds is undefined. We used T2*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and noninvasive amyloid imaging with Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) to analyze the spatial relationship between CAA and microbleeds. On coregistered positron emission tomography (PET) and MRI images, PiB retention was increased at microbleed sites compared to simulated control lesions (p = 0.002) and declined with increasing distance from the microbleed (p &lt; 0.0001). These findings indicate that microbleeds occur preferentially in local regions of concentrated amyloid and support therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing vascular amyloid deposition."
"Early differential diagnosis of motor neuropathies (MN) and lower motor neuron diseases (LMND) is important, as prognosis and therapeutic approaches are different. We evaluated the diagnostic contribution of the biopsy of the motor branch of the obturator nerve and gracilis muscle in 21 consecutive patients in which, after proper clinical and neurophysiological studies, the differential diagnosis was still open. At baseline, motor biopsy was performed; diagnostic confirmation was obtained by 2-year clinical follow-up. Our results support the usefulness of this diagnostic procedure for selected cases of MN and LMND."
"We report 12 aquaporin-4 antibody-positive patients (12% of seropositive Mayo Clinic patients identified since 2005) whose initial presenting symptom of neuromyelitis optica was intractable vomiting. The initial evaluation in 75% was gastroenterologic. Vomiting lasted a median of 4 weeks (range, 2 days-80 weeks). Optic neuritis or transverse myelitis developed after vomiting onset in 11 patients (median interval, 11 weeks; range, 1-156). At last evaluation (median, 48 months after vomiting onset), 7 patients fulfilled neuromyelitis optica diagnostic criteria. Our clinical, pathologic and neuroimaging observations suggest the aquaporin-4-rich area postrema may be a first point of attack in neuromyelitis optica."
"The prevailing view on multiple sclerosis etiopathogenesis has been challenged by the suggested new entity chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency. To test this hypothesis, we studied 21 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis cases and 20 healthy controls with phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, in multiple sclerosis cases we performed contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography. We found no differences regarding internal jugular venous outflow, aqueductal cerebrospinal fluid flow, or the presence of internal jugular blood reflux. Three of 21 cases had internal jugular vein stenoses. In conclusion, we found no evidence confirming the suggested vascular multiple sclerosis hypothesis."
"Complex humanitarian emergencies include the relatively acute, severe, and overwhelming health consequences of armed conflict, food scarcity, mass displacement, and political strife. Neurological manifestations of complex humanitarian emergencies are important and underappreciated consequences of emergencies in populations worldwide. This review critically assesses the existing knowledge of the range of neurological disorders that accompany complex humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters in both the acute phase of crisis and the ""long shadow"" that follows."
"JC virus (JCV) DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provides the laboratory confirmatory diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients whose clinical symptoms and magnetic resonance imaging findings are consistent with PML.The Laboratory of Molecular Medicine and Neuroscience (LMMN), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), made the confirmatory laboratory diagnosis in 35 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients treated with natalizumab. Thirteen patients had 3 or more CSF samples taken from weeks to months following PML diagnosis. Seven of the 13 patients demonstrated persistence of JCV DNA in the CSF even though all patients experienced immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), 11 patients had plasma exchange, and 2 had immunoabsorption. Specific anti-JCV antibody was measured in plasma/sera samples from 25 of the 35 patients. Most of the samples showed moderate to high or rising antibody levels from the time of PML diagnosis. However, plasma from 1 patient at or near the time of PML diagnosis had a titer considered seronegative and 2 other plasma samples from patients had titers considered at baseline for seropositivity. In several PML cases, viral persistence and neurological deficits have continued for several years, indicating that once initiated, JCV infection may not entirely clear, even with IRIS."
"Primary dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by sustained muscle contractions and in which dystonia is the only or predominant clinical feature. TOR1A(DYT1) and the transcription factor THAP1(DYT6) are the only genes identified thus far for primary dystonia. Using electromobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), we demonstrate a physical interaction between THAP1 and the TOR1A promoter that is abolished by pathophysiologic mutations. Our findings provide the first evidence that causative genes for primary dystonia intersect in a common pathway and raise the possibility of developing novel therapies targeting this pathway."
"Surgery has become the standard of care for patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy, with anterior temporal lobe resection the most common operation performed for adults with hippocampal sclerosis. This procedure leads to significant improvement in the lives of the overwhelming majority of patients. Despite improved techniques in neuroimaging that have facilitated the identification of potential surgical candidates, the short-term and long-term success of epilepsy surgery has not changed substantially in recent decades. The basic surgical goal, removal of the amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus, is based on the hypothesis that these structures represent a uniform and contiguous source of seizures in the mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) syndrome. Recent observations from the histopathology of resected tissue, preoperative neuroimaging, and the basic science laboratory suggest that the syndrome is not always a uniform entity. Despite clinical similarity, not all patients become seizure-free. Improving surgical outcomes requires a re-examination of why patients fail surgery. This review examines recent findings from the clinic and laboratory. Historically, we have considered MTLE a single disorder, but it may be time to view it as a group of closely related syndromes with variable type and extent of histopathology. That recognition may lead to identifying the appropriate subgroups that will require different diagnostic and surgical approaches to improve surgical outcomes."
"Analysis of 819 participants enrolled in the Rett syndrome (RTT) Natural History Study validates recently revised diagnostic criteria. 765 females fulfilled 2002 consensus criteria for classic (653/85.4%) or variant (112/14.6%) RTT. All participants classified as classic RTT fulfilled each revised main criterion; supportive criteria were not uniformly present. All variant RTT participants met at least 3 of 6 main criteria in the 2002, 2 of 4 main criteria in the current format, and 5 of 11 supportive criteria in both. This analysis underscores the critical role of main criteria for classic RTT; variant RTT requires both main and supportive criteria."
"Mutations in THAP1 have been associated with dystonia 6. THAP1 encodes a transcription factor with mostly unknown targets. We tested the hypothesis that THAP1 regulates the expression of DYT1 (TOR1A), another dystonia-causing gene. After characterization of the TOR1A promoter, we demonstrate that THAP1 binds to the core promoter of TOR1A. Further, we report that wild type THAP1 represses the expression of TOR1A, whereas dystonia 6-associated mutant THAP1 results in decreased repression of TOR1A. Our data demonstrate that THAP1 regulates the transcription of TOR1A, suggesting transcriptional dysregulation as a cause of dystonia."
"Using intracranial electroencephalographic recordings, we identified a distinct brain activity in 3 patients with refractory epilepsy characterized by very early occurrence from 8 minutes 10 seconds to 22 minutes 40 seconds prior to clinical seizure onset, periodical appearance of slow negative baseline shift, long interpeak interval of 40 to 120 seconds, and disappearance after clinical seizure. We named this activity ""very low frequency oscillation"" (VLFO), which reflected a dynamic process during the preictal state. This observation may render new insight into epileptogenesis and provide additional information concerning the epileptogenic zone as well as prediction of epileptic seizures."
"The risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy increases with the duration of treatment with natalizumab. Planned dosage interruptions have been proposed as a means of decreasing cumulative risk. The clinical consequences of dosage interruption were evaluated in a single center cohort of natalizumab-treated patients. Medical records were reviewed for 84 patients identified with multiple sclerosis who received 12 or more infusions of natalizumab at an academic multiple sclerosis center. Eighty-one percent (68/84) underwent a dosage interruption, and 19% (16/84) had no interruption in natalizumab treatment. Of those with a treatment interruption, 27.9% (19/68) experienced a clinical relapse within 6 months of the suspension, whereas none of the patients with ongoing treatment experienced a flare during months 12 to 18 of treatment (p = 0.017, Fisher exact test). Survival analysis showed that Kaplan-Meier curves comparing dosage interruption to ongoing treatment diverged (p = 0.025). Median time from treatment interruption to relapse onset was 3 months. No clinical predictors associated with an increased risk of developing flares during dosage interruption were identified. Among the 19 patients who had a flare, 7 had severe flares, with a mean number of 16 Gad+ lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging (range, 6-40). Their median Expanded Disability Status Scale at natalizumab interruption was 3.0 and increased to 6.0 during the flare (p = 0.0008). Natalizumab dosage interruption is associated with clinical flares and return of radiographic inflammatory disease activity. Some of these flares can be clinically severe, with a high number of contrast-enhanced lesions, suggesting a possible rebound of disease activity."
"A recent controlled clinical trial suggested a role for amantadine as a treatment for pathological gambling in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Analyzing data from a large cross-sectional study of impulse control disorders (ICDs) in PD, amantadine use (n = 728), vs no amantadine use (n = 2,357), was positively associated with a diagnosis of any ICD (17.6% vs 12.4%, p &lt; 0.001) and compulsive gambling specifically (7.4% vs 4.2%, p &lt; 0.001). This amantadine association remained after controlling for covariates of amantadine use, including both dopamine agonist use and levodopa dosage. Further research, including larger clinical trials, is needed to assess the role of amantadine in the development and treatment of ICDs in PD."
"To test for an association between the LRRK2-G2019S mutation and gait, we studied 52 first-degree relatives of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who carry this mutation. An accelerometer quantified gait during usual-walking, fast-walking, and dual-tasking. Noncarriers (n = 27) and carriers (n = 25) were similar with respect to age, gender, height, and gait speed during all conditions. During dual-tasking and fast-walking, gait variability and the amplitude of the dominant peak of the accelerometer signal were significantly altered among the carriers. These findings support the possibility of previously unidentified, presymptomatic motor changes among relatives who have an increased risk of developing PD."
"The 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) has been recognized to cause neurological complications including seizures and encephalopathy. We identified 18 children with 2009 H1N1 influenza and neurological complications from first and second wave activity, and compared characteristics to seasonal influenza. Seizures, encephalopathy, and status epilepticus were common presentations. Focal neurological symptoms persisted in 22% of patients at discharge. Compared to seasonal influenza, patients with pandemic 2009 influenza were more likely to have encephalopathy, focal neurological findings, aphasia, and abnormal electroencephalographic findings. In addition, we noted a trend toward heightened neurological complications following second wave influenza activity."
"Bleeding into the brain or adjacent structures is one of the most devastating neurological conditions, incurring tremendous emotional, financial, and societal costs. Imaging is essential to differentiate variants of hemorrhage, as the clinical features may be insufficient. A comprehensive approach to hemorrhage therefore relies on imaging to disclose pathophysiology, elucidate mechanisms, and thereby open further avenues to effective treatment. Hemorrhage patterns from superficial to deep locations in the brain are surveyed in this work, noting myriad potential causes and the influential pathophysiology of arterial ischemia, venous hypertension, and microvascular dysfunction. Recent progress of imaging studies and novel techniques to evaluate hemorrhage are explored. For decades, only computed tomography was available to define a hematoma without corroborating evidence of other pathology whereas multimodal computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, including noninvasive imaging of brain tissue, vessels, and perfusion, have now radically altered clinical practice. Imaging of the blood-brain barrier, cerebral microbleeds, coexistent ischemia, associated vascular lesions, and markers of hemorrhage expansion is possible with routine protocols akin to diagnostic strategies for ischemic stroke. Imaging applications for hemorrhagic transformation, venous thrombosis, and microvascular disorders are considered with a perspective that balances concern for hemorrhage with prevention of ischemia as these processes are often intertwined and clinical conundrums arise. Imminent imaging advances are anticipated with increased use of detailed imaging for hemorrhage and overlap with cerebral ischemia. Numerous questions abound regarding optimal management of hemorrhage and definitive treatments are lacking, yet imaging of pivotal pathophysiology offers tremendous opportunity for future progress in combating this debilitating condition."
"Authorship of scientific publications holds great importance for basic and clinical researchers. Academic appointments and promotions, grant funding, and salary support depend to some extent on published recognition through authorship. Peer-recognition and personal satisfaction are additional incentives for authorship. Some current ""rules"" and conventions for assigning authorship are based on largely unwritten but widely-accepted arbitrary decisions. We hypothesize that the inherent uncertainties about assigning ""credit where credit is due"" serve as a disincentive for clinicians considering an academic career and may discourage or at least impede the collaborations essential to address most translational and clinical research issues. Surveys of the New England Journal of Medicine and the Annals of Neurology suggest that neurologists have been slow to adopt ways of sharing ""credit"" appropriately. We recommend that authorship of reports of the primary results of multicenter or multidisciplinary studies should be in the name of the group of investigators collaborating on the work. Given the availability of digital methods that could apportion credit quantitatively, academic leaders, including funding agencies and promotions committees, should consider challenging outmoded authorship conventions. Authorship is too important to be left to chance."
"Migraine with aura is often the first manifestation of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy syndrome (CADASIL), a disorder caused by NOTCH3 gene mutations expressed predominantly in vascular smooth muscle. Here, we report that cortical spreading depression (CSD), the electrophysiological substrate of migraine aura, is enhanced in mice expressing a vascular Notch 3 CADASIL mutation (R90C) or a Notch 3 knockout mutation. The phenotype was stronger in Notch 3 knockout mice, implicating both loss of function and neomorphic mutations in its pathogenesis. Our results link vascular smooth muscle Notch 3 mutations to enhanced spreading depression susceptibility, implicating the neurovascular unit in the development of migraine aura."
Two mutational mechanisms are known to underlie Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD): heterozygous dominant negatively-acting mutations and recessively-acting loss-of-function mutations. We describe large genomic deletions on chromosome 21q22.3 as a novel type of mutation underlying recessively inherited UCMD in 2 families. Clinically unaffected parents carrying large genomic deletions of COL6A1and COL6A2also provide conclusive evidence that haploinsufficiency for COL6A1and COL6A2is not a disease mechanism for Bethlem myopathy. Our findings have important implications for the genetic evaluation of patients with collagen VI-related myopathies as well as for potential therapeutic interventions for this patient population.
Public and private investment in induced pluripotent stem cell research is likely to have major benefits for health; however human embryonic stem cell research remains essential.
Market exclusivity given to biologics puts burdens on healthcare and new development.
"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction, where acetylcholine receptor (AChR), muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein 4 (Lrp4) are essential. About 80% and 0% to 10% of patients with generalized MG have autoantibodies to AChR and MuSK, respectively, but pathogenic factors are elusive in others. Here we show that a proportion of AChR antibody-negative patients have autoantibodies to Lrp4. These antibodies inhibit binding of Lrp4 to its ligand and predominantly belong to the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) subclass, a complement activator. These findings together indicate the involvement of Lrp4 antibodies in the pathogenesis of AChR antibody-negative MG."
"Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are common and portend a high short-term risk of stroke. Evidence-based recommendations for the urgent evaluation and treatment of patients with TIA have been published. However, implementation of these recommendations reliably and consistently will require changes in the systems of care established for TIA. The National Stroke Association convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts to develop recommendations for the essential components of systems of care at hospitals to improve the quality of care provided to patients with TIA. The panel recommends that hospitals establish standardized protocols to assure rapid and complete evaluation and treatment for patients with TIA, with particular attention to urgency and close observation in patients at high risk of stroke."
"Preclinical evidence and uncontrolled clinical studies suggest an increased risk for distant spread and development of a gliomatosislike phenotype at recurrence or progression of malignant glioma patients treated with bevacizumab (BEV), an antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Here we asked whether BEV treatment of recurrent malignant glioma increases the risk of distant or diffuse tumor spread at further recurrence. BEV-treated patients were compared with matched pairs of patients treated without anti-VEGF regimens. T1 contrast-enhanced (T1+c) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images were analyzed using a novel automated tool of image analysis. At the start of the study, 20.5% of BEV-treated and 22.7% of non-BEV-treated patients had displayed distant or diffuse recurrence. Distant or diffuse recurrences were observed in 22% (BEV) and 18% (non-BEV) on T1+c and in 25% and 18% on FLAIR (p &gt; 0.05). The correlation between changes on T1+c and FLAIR at progression was high. The risk of distant or diffuse recurrence at the time of failure of BEV-containing treatments was not higher than with anti-VEGF-free regimens, arguing against a specific property of BEV that promotes distant tumor growth or a gliomatosislike phenotype at recurrence."
"The mammalian gastrointestinal track harbors a highly heterogeneous population of microbial organisms that are essential for the complete development of the immune system. The gut microbes or ""microbiota,"" coupled with host genetics, determine the development of both local microbial populations and the immune system to create a complex balance recently termed the ""microbiome."" Alterations of the gut microbiome may lead to dysregulation of immune responses both in the gut and in distal effector immune sites such as the central nervous system (CNS). Recent findings in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of human multiple sclerosis, suggest that altering certain bacterial populations present in the gut can lead to a proinflammatory condition that may result in the development of autoimmune diseases, in particular human multiple sclerosis. In contrast, other commensal bacteria and their antigenic products, when presented in the correct context, can protect against inflammation within the CNS."
"Chronic peripheral neuropathic pain is the result of abnormal activity in sensory nerves. It is well recognized that this sensory nerve dysfunction can be caused by traumatic, toxic, or metabolic insult to the nerve. In addition, there is growing recognition that neuropathic pain is a frequent manifestation of neurodegenerative diseases. In this regard, important clues to the cellular mechanisms of neuropathic pain may be found by close examination of neurodegenerative diseases (including Parkinson's disease) in which neuropathic pain is often an underappreciated but important clinical manifestation. This approach identifies specific mitochondrial and cytoskeletal mechanisms, previously implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases in the central nervous system, that might contribute to neuropathic dysfunction in peripheral sensory nerve fibers. Investigations in preclinical models of common peripheral neuropathic pain conditions have supported the idea that a subset of these cellular mechanisms of neurodegeneration can produce painful hyperactivity in primary afferent nociceptors. Importantly, this emerging concept of neurodegenerative disease mechanisms in the primary afferent nociceptor identifies novel molecular targets for the treatment neuropathic pain."
"T cells exit secondary lymphoid organs along a sphingosine1-phosphate (S1P) gradient and, accordingly, are reduced in blood upon fingolimod-mediated S1P-receptor (S1PR)-blockade. Serving as a model of adaptive immunity, we characterized cellular and humoral immune responses to influenza vaccine in fingolimod-treated patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and in untreated healthy controls. Although the mode of action of fingolimod might predict reduced immunity, vaccine-triggered T cells accumulated normally in blood despite efficient S1PR-blockade. Concentrations of anti-influenza A/B immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG also increased similarly in both groups. These results indicate that fingolimod-treated individuals can mount vaccine-specific adaptive immune responses comparable to healthy controls."
"Currently, stroke laboratory examinations are usually performed in the centralized hospital laboratory, but often planned thrombolysis is given before all results are available, to minimize delay. In this study, we examined the feasibility of gaining valuable time by transferring the complete stroke laboratory workup required by stroke guidelines to a point-of-care laboratory system, that is, placed at a stroke treatment room contiguous to the computed tomography, where the patients are admitted and where they obtain neurological, laboratory, and imaging examinations and treatment by the same dedicated team. Our results showed that reconfiguration of the entire stroke laboratory analysis to a point-of-care system was feasible for 200 consecutively admitted patients. This strategy reduced the door-to-therapy-decision times from 84 &#xb1; 26 to 40 &#xb1; 24 min (p &lt; 0.001). Results of most laboratory tests (except activated partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio) revealed close agreement with results from a standard centralized hospital laboratory. These findings may offer a new solution for the integration of laboratory workup into routine hyperacute stroke management."
"The aborted trial of semagacestat has led some to invoke unanticipated effects of &#x3b3;-secretase inhibition on formation of amyloid &#x3b2;. However, the many substrates for &#x3b3;-secretases and the varied biological effects of each of the resultant cleavage products make ascribing causality much more complex than that."
"New evidence and consensus has led to further revision of the McDonald Criteria for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. The use of imaging for demonstration of dissemination of central nervous system lesions in space and time has been simplified, and in some circumstances dissemination in space and time can be established by a single scan. These revisions simplify the Criteria, preserve their diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, address their applicability across populations, and may allow earlier diagnosis and more uniform and widespread use."
"Recent reports showed many patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) harbor a retrovirus, xenotropic murine leukemia-related virus (XMRV), in blood; other studies could not replicate this finding. A useful next step would be to examine cerebrospinal fluid, because in some patients CFS is thought to be a brain disorder. Finding a microbe in the central nervous system would have greater significance than in blood because of the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. We examined cerebrospinal fluid from 43 CFS patients using polymerase chain reaction techniques, but did not find XMRV or multiple other common viruses, suggesting that exploration of other causes or pathogenetic mechanisms is warranted."
"Chronic neurological disorders in children have significant effects on adult medical and social function. Transition and then formal transfer of care from pediatric to adult services is a complex process, although there are virtually no objective data to inform physicians about the most effective approach. Some neurological disorders that start in children are a danger to society if poorly treated in adulthood, some disorders that were previously lethal in childhood now permit survival well into adulthood, and others are static in childhood but progressive in adulthood. Some disorders remit or are cured in childhood but continue to have serious comorbidity in adulthood, whereas others are similar and persistent in children and adults. Maturity, provision of information, and cognitive problems are confounders. We discuss several models of transition/transfer but prefer a joint pediatric/adult transition clinic. We make a series of suggestions about how to improve the transition/transfer process with the hope of better medical and social adult outcome for children with neurological disorders."
"Ten members of a 3-generation pedigree with 7 showing Tourette syndrome/chronic tic phenotype (TS-CTD) were evaluated with whole exome sequencing. We identified 3 novel, nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants in the MRPL3, DNAJC13, and OFCC1 genes that segregated with chronic tic phenotype. These variants were not present in 100 control subjects or in dbSNP/1000 Genomes databases. A novel variant in the 5' untranslated region of the OFCC1 gene was found in 2 TS-CTD patients from a different pedigree. Further studies will clarify the importance of variants in MRPL3, DNAJC13, and OFCC1 genes in TS."
"Myelination is a central nervous system (CNS) process wherein oligodendrocyte-axon interactions lead to the establishment of myelin sheaths that stabilize, protect, and electrically insulate axons. In inflammatory demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), the degeneration and eventual loss of functional myelin sheaths slows and blocks saltatory conduction in axons, which results in clinical impairment. However, remyelination can occur, and lesions can be partially repaired, resulting in clinical remission. The recruitment and activation of resident oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) play a critical role in the repair process because these cells have the capacity to differentiate into functional myelinating cells. Mature oligodendrocytes, however, are thought to have lost the capacity to develop new myelin sheaths and frequently undergo programmed cell death in MS. The endogenous capacity to generate new oligodendrocytes in MS is limited, and this is predominantly due to the presence of inhibitory components that block OPC differentiation and maturation. Here, we present an overview of recently identified negative regulators of oligodendroglial differentiation and their potential relevance for CNS repair in MS. Because currently available immunomodulatory drugs for MS mainly target inflammatory cascades outside the brain and fail to repair existing lesions, achieving more efficient lesion repair constitutes an important goal for future MS therapies."
"Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in infants and young children. Therapeutic opportunities are very limited for neonatal and pediatric HIE. Specific neural systems and populations of cells are selectively vulnerable in HIE; however, the mechanisms of degeneration are unresolved. These mechanisms involve oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, inflammation, and the activation of several different cell death pathways. Decades ago the structural and mechanistic basis of the cellular degeneration in HIE was thought to be necrosis. Subsequently, largely due to advances in cell biology and to experimental animal studies, emphasis has been switched to apoptosis or autophagy mediated by programmed cell death (PCD) mechanisms as important forms of degeneration in HIE. We have conceptualized based on morphological and biochemical data that this degeneration is better classified according to an apoptosis-necrosis cell death continuum and that programmed cell necrosis has prominent contribution in the neurodegeneration of HIE in animal models. It is likely that neonatal HIE evolves through many cell death chreodes influenced by the dynamic injury landscape. The relevant injury mechanisms remain to be determined in human neonatal HIE, though preliminary work suggests a complexity in the cell death mechanisms greater than that anticipated from experimental animal models. The accurate identification of the various cell death chreodes and their mechanisms unfolding within the immature brain matrix could provide fresh insight for developing meaningful therapies for neonatal and pediatric HIE."
"The blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) is the functional equivalent of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the sense of providing a specialized microenvironment for the cellular constituents of the spinal cord. Even if intuitively the BSCB could be considered as the morphological extension of the BBB into the spinal cord, evidence suggests that this is not so. The BSCB shares the same principal building blocks with the BBB; nevertheless, it seems that morphological and functional differences may exist between them. Dysfunction of the BSCB plays a fundamental role in the etiology or progression of several pathological conditions of the spinal cord, such as spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and radiation-induced myelopathy. This review summarizes current knowledge of the morphology of the BSCB, the methodology of studying the BSCB, and the potential role of BSCB dysfunction in selected disorders of the spinal cord, and finally summarizes therapeutic approaches to the BSCB."
"Existing and emerging strategies for managing L-dopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) in patients with Parkinson disease have involved either delaying the introduction of L-dopa therapy, treatment with an antidyskinetic agent, using a therapy or delivery system that can provide continuous dopaminergic stimulation, or using novel agents that target receptors implicated in the mechanisms underlying LIDs. Treatment with dopamine agonists such as pramipexole or ropinirole allows levodopa to be delayed, but once levodopa is added to the drug regimen the usual course of onset of dyskinesias is observed. Amantadine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, is so far the only approved compound with evidence of providing a sustained antidyskinetic benefit in the absence of unacceptable side effects. These findings support the hypothesis of glutamate overactivity in the development of dyskinesias. More continuous delivery of dopaminergic medication, such as through intraintestinal or subcutaneous routes, is promising but invasive and associated with injection site reactions. As a result of molecular research and elucidation of the role of a variety of neurotransmitters in the mechanism of LIDs, new compounds have been identified, including those that modulate the direct and indirect striatal output pathways; some of these new agents are in the early stages of development or undergoing proof-of-concept evaluation as antidyskinetic agents."
"Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults. Its often rapid clinical course, with many medical and psychosocial challenges, requires a multidisciplinary management. Modern multimodality treatment and care improve patients' life expectancy and quality of life. This review covers major aspects of care of glioblastoma patients with a focus on the management of common symptoms and complications. We aim to provide a guide for clinicians confronted with glioblastoma patients in their everyday practice."
"Until recently, all approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease treatments were administered parenterally. Oral fingolimod was approved in September 2010 by the US Food and Drug Administration to reduce relapses and disability progression in relapsing forms of MS. In the clinical trials that led to approval, fingolimod reduced not only acute relapses and magnetic resonance imaging lesion activity but also disability progression and brain volume loss, suggesting preservation of tissue. Fingolimod's mechanism of action in MS is not known with certainty. Its active form, fingolimod-phosphate (fingolimod-P), is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulator that inhibits egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes and their recirculation, potentially reducing trafficking of pathogenic cells into the central nervous system (CNS). Fingolimod also readily penetrates the CNS, and fingolimod-P formed in situ may have direct effects on neural cells. Fingolimod potently inhibits the MS animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, but is ineffective in mice with selective deficiency of the S1P&#x2081; S1PR subtype on astrocytes despite normal expression in the immune compartment. These findings suggest that S1PR modulation by fingolimod in both the immune system and CNS, producing a combination of beneficial anti-inflammatory and possibly neuroprotective/reparative effects, may contribute to its efficacy in MS. In clinical trials, fingolimod was generally safe and well tolerated. Its interaction with S1PRs in a variety of tissues largely accounts for the reported adverse effects, which were seen more frequently with doses 2.5 to 10x the approved 0.5 mg dose. Fingolimod's unique mechanism of action distinguishes it from all other currently approved MS therapies."
"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a frequent sleep disorder that is linked to disturbed iron homeostasis. Genetic studies identified MEIS1 as an RLS-predisposing gene, where the RLS risk haplotype is associated with decreased MEIS1 mRNA and protein expression. We show here that RNA interference treatment of the MEIS1 worm orthologue increases ferritin expression in Caenorhabditis elegans and that the RLS-associated haplotype leads to increased expression of ferritin and DMT1 in RLS brain tissues. Additionally, human cells cultured under iron-deficient conditions show reduced MEIS1 expression. Our data establish a link between the RLS MEIS1 gene and iron metabolism."
"Academic neurology is undergoing transformational changes. The public investment in biomedical research and clinical care is enormous and there is a growing perception that the return on this huge investment is insufficient. Hospitals, departments, and individual neurologists should expect more scrutiny as information about their quality of care and financial relationships with industry are increasingly reported to the public. There are unprecedented changes occurring in the financing and delivery of health care and research that will have profound impact on the mission and operation of academic departments of neurology. With the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) there will be increasing emphasis on research that demonstrates value and includes the patient's perspective. Here we review neurological investigations of our clinical and research enterprises that focus on quality of care and comparative effectiveness, including cost-effectiveness. By highlighting progress made and the challenges that lie ahead, we hope to create a clinical, educational, and research roadmap for academic departments of neurology to thrive in today's increasingly regulated environment."
"Over the past 20 years, stem cell technologies have become an increasingly attractive option to investigate and treat neurodegenerative diseases. In the current review, we discuss the process of extending basic stem cell research into translational therapies for patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. We begin with a discussion of the burden of these diseases on society, emphasizing the need for increased attention toward advancing stem cell therapies. We then explain the various types of stem cells utilized in neurodegenerative disease research, and outline important issues to consider in the transition of stem cell therapy from bench to bedside. Finally, we detail the current progress regarding the applications of stem cell therapies to specific neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal muscular atrophy. With a greater understanding of the capacity of stem cell technologies, there is growing public hope that stem cell therapies will continue to progress into realistic and efficacious treatments for neurodegenerative diseases."
"Lymph node-type T- and B-cell infiltrates with germinal centers are characteristic features of the hyperplastic thymus in early onset myasthenia gravis (EOMG).Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection confers survival advantages on B cells, and has recently been implicated in tertiary lymphoid tissue formation in EOMG. We evaluated the frequency of intrathymic EBV-infected B-lineage cells and antiviral immune responses in treatment-naive patients with EOMG. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify the content of genomic EBV DNA (BamHI-W repeat region) in thymic cell suspensions. Serial paraffin sections of EOMG thymi were analyzed for the presence of EBV-encoded RNA by in situ hybridization and for viral gene expression by immunohistochemistry. Humoral and cellular immune responses to viral antigens were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry-based intracellular cytokine staining. We detected minimal levels of viral DNA-corresponding to single viral genomes-in only 6 of 16 hyperplastic EOMG thymi, indicating extreme rarity of viral copy numbers in the investigated thymic samples. That was confirmed by similar rarity of EBV-encoded RNA and viral proteins identified in thymic sections. Furthermore, EBV-specific T- and B-cell responses were unchanged in patients with EOMG. These findings do not support an etiologic role for EBV in the initiation of EOMG."
"In neurology, as in any other clinical specialty, there is a need to develop treatment strategies that allow stratification of therapies to optimize efficacy and minimize toxicity. Pharmacogenomics is one such method for therapy optimization: it aims to elucidate the relationship between human genome sequence variation and differential drug responses. Approaches have focused on candidate approaches investigating absorption-, distribution-, metabolism, and elimination (ADME)-related genes (pharmacokinetic pathways), and potential drug targets (pharmacodynamic pathways). To date, however, only few genetic variants have been incorporated into clinical algorithms. Unfortunately, a large number of studies have thrown up contradictory results due to a number of deficiencies, including small sample sizes, inadequate phenotyping, and genotyping strategies. Thus, there still exists an urgent need to establish biomarkers that could help to select for patients with an optimal benefit to risk relationship. Here we review recent advances, and limitations, in pharmacogenomics for agents used in neuroimmunology, neurodegenerative diseases, ischemic stroke, epilepsy, and primary headaches. Further work is still required in all of these areas, which really needs to progress on several fronts, including better standardized phenotyping, appropriate sample sizes through multicenter collaborations and judicious use of new technological advances such as genome-wide approaches, next generation sequencing and systems biology. In time, this is likely to lead to improvements in the benefit-harm balance of neurological therapies, cost efficiency, and identification of new drugs."
"The relationship between neurodegeneration and the 2 hallmark proteins of Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) and tau, is still unclear. Here, we examined 286 nondemented participants (107 cognitively normal older adults and 179 memory impaired individuals) who underwent longitudinal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and lumbar puncture. Using mixed effects models, we investigated the relationship between longitudinal entorhinal cortex atrophy rate, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau(181p) and CSF A&#x3b2;(1-42) . We found a significant relationship between elevated entorhinal cortex atrophy rate and decreased CSF A&#x3b2;(1-42) only with elevated CSF p-tau(181p) . Our findings indicate that A&#x3b2;-associated volume loss occurs only in the presence of phospho-tau in humans at risk for dementia."
"The prevalence of congenital myopathies in the United States has not been examined. To address this, we determined the point prevalence of congenital myopathies in a well-defined pediatric population from Southeastern Michigan. The overall point prevalence was 1:26,000. Mutations in RYR1 were the most common cause of congenital myopathies at 1:90,000. Our data broadly agrees with estimates from previous European studies and provides the first estimate of the prevalence of congenital myopathies in the United States. Ann Neurol 2011;70:662-665."
"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) results from deposition of &#x3b2;-amyloid in the media and adventitia of small arteries and capillaries of the leptomeninges and cerebral cortex and is a major cause of lobar intracerebral hemorrhage and cognitive impairment in the elderly. CAA is associated with a high prevalence of magnetic resonance imaging markers of small vessel disease, including cerebral microbleeds and white matter hyperintensities. Although advanced CAA is present in approximately &#xbc; of brains with Alzheimer disease (AD), fewer than half of CAA cases meet pathologic criteria for AD. This review will discuss the pathophysiology of CAA and focus on new imaging modalities and laboratory biomarkers that may aid in the clinical diagnosis of individuals with the disease."
"Cerebral palsy is a major health problem caused by brain damage during pregnancy, delivery, or the immediate postnatal period. Perinatal stroke, intraventricular hemorrhage, and asphyxia are the most common causes of neonatal brain damage. Periventricular white matter damage (periventricular leukomalacia) is the predominant form in premature infants and the most common antecedent of cerebral palsy. Stem cell treatment has proven effective in restoring injured organs and tissues in animal models. The potential of stem cells for self-renewal and differentiation translates into substantial neuroprotection and neuroregeneration in the animal brain, with minimal risks of rejection and side effects. Stem cell treatments described to date have used neural stem cells, embryonic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, umbilical cord stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells. Most of these treatments are still experimental. In this review, we focus on the efficacy of stem cell therapy in animal models of cerebral palsy, and discuss potential implications for current and future clinical trials."
"A role for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in myasthenia gravis pathogenesis has been suggested recently. Using in situ hybridization for the detection of the EBV-encoded RNAs and EBNA1-specific immunohistochemistry, we found no latently infected cells in a series of thymus specimens from patients with myasthenia gravis showing lymphofollicular thymitis. In addition, using immunohistochemistry and an antibody specific for the viral immediate early protein BZLF1, no evidence of lytic EBV infection was seen in these cases. Our results therefore do not support a direct role of thymic EBV infection in the pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis."
"Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are often told that solid organ donation is not possible following death, although the reasons for exclusion are not evidence based. Because ALS patients typically remain sentient until death, organs may be procured under donation after cardiac death protocols. Anticipating this need, our institution created a process for organ donation in ventilator-dependent ALS patients that was subsequently implemented. To our knowledge, this is the first report of organ donation in a patient with rapidly progressive ventilator-dependent ALS."
"The discovery that electroencephalography (EEG) contains useful information at frequencies above the traditional 80Hz limit has had a profound impact on our understanding of brain function. In epilepsy, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs, &gt;80Hz) have proven particularly important and useful. This literature review describes the morphology, clinical meaning, and pathophysiology of epileptic HFOs. To record HFOs, the intracranial EEG needs to be sampled at least at 2,000Hz. The oscillatory events can be visualized by applying a high-pass filter and increasing the time and amplitude scales, or EEG time-frequency maps can show the amount of high-frequency activity. HFOs appear excellent markers for the epileptogenic zone. In patients with focal epilepsy who can benefit from surgery, invasive EEG is often required to identify the epileptic cortex, but current information is sometimes inadequate. Removal of brain tissue generating HFOs has been related to better postsurgical outcome than removing the seizure onset zone, indicating that HFOs may mark cortex that needs to be removed to achieve seizure control. The pathophysiology of epileptic HFOs is challenging, probably involving populations of neurons firing asynchronously. They differ from physiological HFOs in not being paced by rhythmic inhibitory activity and in their possible origin from population spikes. Their link to the epileptogenic zone argues that their study will teach us much about the pathophysiology of epileptogenesis and ictogenesis. HFOs show promise for improving surgical outcome and accelerating intracranial EEG investigations. Their potential needs to be assessed by future research."
"The development of a clinically validated biomarker of acute cerebral ischemia would have the potential to facilitate the use of time-sensitive reperfusion strategies, allow for individualization of patient care by predicting relative risk of hemorrhage and volume of penumbral tissue, and add valuable prognostic information for patients presenting with acute stroke. Additionally, a stroke biomarker might benefit early stage clinical research by serving as a surrogate measure of ischemic injury. Although at present there are no clinically validated biomarkers of acute stroke, previous studies have focused on markers associated with different components of the ischemic cascade, including microglial activation, inflammation, oxidative stress, neuronal injury, hemostasis, and endothelial dysfunction. Evolving technologies have provided high throughput approaches to investigate potential gene and protein signatures, and methods to measure newly discovered markers of cell death and immune responses. Prior to defining the clinical utility of stroke biomarkers, it is critical to understand the inherent limitations of a biomarker-based approach and define its potential value for providing adjunctive diagnostic and prognostic information. The identification and validation of a clinically relevant biomarker, or panel of markers, of stroke will ultimately require incorporation of both stringent research design and assessment in the clinical context in which the marker will be used."
"Amyloid-beta (A&#x3b2;) accumulation was evaluated with 2 [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography scans about 2.5 years apart in 146 cognitively normal adults. Seventeen of 21 participants with initially elevated A&#x3b2; deposition demonstrated subsequent A&#x3b2; plaque growth (approximately 8.0% per year), and none reverted to a state of no A&#x3b2; deposits. Ten individuals converted from negative to positive PiB status, based on a threshold of the mean cortical binding potential, representing a conversion rate of 3.1% per year. Individuals with an &#x3b5;4 allele of apolipoprotein E demonstrated increased incidence of conversion (7.0% per year). Our findings suggest that the major growth in A&#x3b2; burden occurs during a preclinical stage of Alzheimer disease (AD), prior to the onset of AD-related symptoms."
"Inflammation is increasingly recognized as being of both physiological and pathological importance in the immature brain. The rationale of this review is to present an update on this topic with focus on long-term consequences of inflammation during childhood and in adults. The immature brain can be exposed to inflammation in connection with viral or bacterial infection during pregnancy or as a result of sterile central nervous system (CNS) insults. Through efficient anti-inflammatory and reparative processes, inflammation may resolve without any harmful effects on the brain. Alternatively, inflammation contributes to injury or enhances CNS vulnerability. Acute inflammation can also be shifted to a chronic inflammatory state and/or adversely affect brain development. Hypothetically, microglia are the main immunocompetent cells in the immature CNS, and depending on the stimulus, molecular context, and timing, these cells will acquire various phenotypes, which will be critical regarding the CNS consequences of inflammation. Inflammation has long-term consequences and could speculatively modify the risk of a variety of neurological disorders, including cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, cognitive impairment, and Parkinson disease. So far, the picture is incomplete, and data mostly experimental. Further studies are required to strengthen the associations in humans and to determine whether novel therapeutic interventions during the perinatal period can influence the occurrence of neurological disease later in life."
"To investigate the putative interaction between chronic exposure to adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine and genetic influences on Parkinson's disease (PD), we determined whether deletion of the adenosine A(2A) receptor in knockout (KO) mice protects against dopaminergic neuron degeneration induced by a mutant human &#x3b1;-synuclein (hm(2)-&#x3b1;SYN) transgene containing both A53T and A30P. The A(2A) KO completely prevented loss of dopamine and dopaminergic neurons caused by the mutant &#x3b1;-synuclein transgene without altering levels of its expression. The adenosine A(2A) receptor appears required for neurotoxicity in a mutant &#x3b1;-synuclein model of PD. Together with prior studies the present findings indirectly support the neuroprotective potential of caffeine and more specific A(2A) antagonists."
"Recent developments in high-throughput sequence capture methods and next-generation sequencing technologies have now made exome sequencing a viable approach to elucidate the genetic basis of Mendelian disorders with hitherto unknown etiology. In addition, exome sequencing is increasingly being employed as a diagnostic tool for specific genetic diseases, particularly in the context of those disorders characterized by significant genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, for example, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and congenital disorders of glycosylation. Such disorders are challenging to interrogate with conventional polymerase chain reaction-Sanger sequencing methods, because of the inherent difficulty in prioritizing candidate genes for diagnostic testing. Here, we explore the value of exome sequencing as a diagnostic tool and discuss whether exome sequencing can come to serve a dual role in diagnosis and discovery. We summarize the current status of exome sequencing, the technical challenges facing it, and its adaptation to diagnostics, and make recommendations for the use of exome sequencing as a routine diagnostic tool. Finally, we discuss pertinent ethical concerns, such as the use of exome sequencing data, originally generated in a diagnostic context, in research investigations."
"Limb girdle muscular dystrophy 1D/1E (OMIM nomenclature LGMD1D, Human Gene Nomenclature Committee LGMD1E), a skeletal and cardiac myopathy, has previously been linked to chromosome 6q23. We used laser capture microdissection to isolate cytoplasmic inclusions from skeletal muscle from a patient with LGMD1D/1E, performed mass spectrometry-based proteomics on these minute inclusions, and identified through bioinformatics desmin as their major constituent. Sequencing in this patient and family members identified the genetic basis of the previously reported 6q23 linked LGMD1D/1E to be due to an intron splice donor site mutation (IVS3+3A&gt;G) of the desmin gene located on chromosome 2q35."
"Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury remains a major cause of cerebral palsy. Although therapeutic hypothermia is now established to improve recovery from hypoxia-ischemia (HI) at term, many infants continue to survive with disability, and hypothermia has not yet been tested in preterm infants. There is increasing evidence from in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies that stem/progenitor cells may have multiple beneficial effects on outcome after hypoxic-ischemic injury. Stem/progenitor cells have shown great promise in animal studies in decreasing neurological impairment; however, the mechanisms of action of stem cells, and the optimal type, dose, and method of administration remain surprisingly unclear, and some studies have found no benefit. Although cell-based interventions after completion of the majority of secondary cell death appear to have potential to improve functional outcome for neonates after HI, further rigorous testing in translational animal models is required before randomized controlled trials should be considered."
"There is an enormous unmet need for knowledge about how new insights from discovery and translational research can yield measurable, population-level improvements in health and reduction in mortality among those having or at risk for neurological disease. Once several, well-conducted randomized controlled trials establish the efficacy of a given therapy, implementation research can generate new knowledge about barriers to uptake of the therapy into widespread clinical care, and what strategies are effective in overcoming those barriers and in addressing health disparities. Comparative effectiveness research aims to elucidate the relative value (including clinical benefit, clinical harms, and/or costs) of alternative efficacious management approaches to a neurological disorder, generally through direct comparisons, and may include comparisons of methodologies for implementation. Congress has recently appropriated resources and established an institute to prioritize funding for such research. Neurologists and neuroscientists should understand the scope and objectives of comparative effectiveness and implementation research, their range of methodological approaches (formal literature syntheses, randomized trials, observational studies, modeling), and existing research resources (centers for literature synthesis, registries, practice networks) relevant to research for neurological conditions, to close the well-documented evidence-to-practice gap. Future directions include building this research resource capacity, producing scientists trained to conduct rigorous comparative effectiveness and implementation research, and embracing innovative strategies to set research priorities in these areas."
"Cerebrospinal fluid samples collected from children during initial presentation of central nervous system inflammation, who may or may not subsequently be diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis (MS), were subjected to large-scale proteomics screening. Unexpectedly, major compact myelin membrane proteins typically implicated in MS were not detected. However, multiple molecules that localize to the node of Ranvier and the surrounding axoglial apparatus membrane were implicated, indicating perturbed axon-glial interactions in those children destined for diagnosis of MS."
"We report the first case of a missense mutation in MPZ causing a gain of glycosylation in myelin protein zero, the main protein of peripheral nervous system myelin. The patient was affected by a severe demyelinating neuropathy caused by a missense mutation, D32N, that created a new glycosylation sequence. We confirmed that the mutant protein is hyperglycosylated, is partially retained into the Golgi apparatus in vitro, and disrupts intercellular adhesion. By sequential experiments, we demonstrated that hyperglycosylation is the main mechanism of this mutation. Gain of glycosylation is a new mechanism in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1B."
"In 4 infants with a new lethal autonomic sensory neuropathy with clinical features similar to familial dysautonomia as well as contractures, we identified a deleterious mutation in the DST gene, using homozygosity mapping followed by exome sequencing. DST encodes dystonin, a cytoskeleton linker protein, and the mutation results in an unstable transcript. Interestingly, dystonin is significantly more abundant in cells of familial dysautonomia patients with IKBKAP (I-&#x3ba;-B kinase complex-associated protein) mutation compared to fibroblasts of controls, suggesting that upregulation of dystonin is responsible for the milder course in familial dysautonomia. Homozygosity mapping followed by exome sequencing is a successful approach to identify mutated genes in rare monogenic disorders."
"The transcription factor EGR2 is expressed in Schwann cells, where it controls peripheral nerve myelination. Mutations of EGR2 have been found in patients with congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1D. In a patient with congenital amyelinating neuropathy, we observed pathological abnormalities recapitulating the peripheral nervous system phenotype of homozygous Egr2-null mice. This patient, born from consanguineous parents, showed no EGR2 immunoreactivity in Schwann cells and harbored a homozygous 10.7-kilobase-long deletion encompassing a myelin-specific enhancer of EGR2. This regulatory mutation is the first genetic abnormality associated with congenital amyelinating neuropathy in humans."
"Congenital muscular dystrophies are a highly heterogeneous group of conditions. In the last few years the identification of several new genes encoding for both glycosyltransferases and structural proteins has expanded the spectrum of the known forms. New classifications based on combined clinical, genetic and pathological data include all the recently discovered genes and allow an easier identification of the different forms and insight on pathogenetic mechanisms. The aim of this review is to discuss the most recent advances in this field, providing a conceptual framework to help the understanding of the responsible mechanisms and, when available, an update on the therapeutic perspectives."
"Somatic mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are hypothesized to play a role in Parkinson disease (PD), but large increases in mtDNA mutations have not previously been found in PD, potentially because neurons with high mutation levels degenerate and thus are absent in late stage tissue. To address this issue, we studied early stage PD cases and cases of incidental Lewy body disease (ILBD), which is thought to represent presymptomatic PD. We show for the first time that mtDNA mutation levels in substantia nigra neurons are significantly elevated in this group of early PD and ILBD cases."
"Most of the time the bladder is locked in storage mode, switching to voiding only when it is judged safe and/or socially appropriate to urinate. Here we show, in humans and rodents, that deep brain stimulation in the periaqueductal gray matter can rapidly and reversibly manipulate switching within the micturition control circuitry, to defer voiding and maintain urinary continence, even when the bladder is full. Manipulation of neural continence pathways by deep brain stimulation may offer new avenues for the treatment of urinary incontinence of central origin."
"In 2006, Yamanaka's group pioneered a method for reprogramming somatic cells by introducing definite transcription factors, which enabled the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with pluripotency comparable to that of embryonic stem cells. These iPSCs are attracting considerable attention for their potential in rejection-tolerance personalized replacement therapy. In recent years, patient-derived iPSCs have been used to recapitulate the phenotypes of neurological diseases and broaden our understanding of the pathogenesis of many neurological diseases, including those of late onset. It is now expected that iPSCs will serve as an unlimited source of disease-specific neural cells for use in disease modeling. This review outlines current progress in neurodegenerative disease research involving iPSCs and discusses the potential roles iPSCs may play in helping researchers elucidate the pathological processes of neurodegenerative diseases and in drug discovery and regenerative medicine."
"Oligodendroglioma is characterized by mutations of IDH and CIC, 1p/19q loss, and slow growth. We found that NHE-1 on 1p is silenced in oligodendrogliomas secondary to IDH-associated hypermethylation and 1p allelic loss. Silencing lowers intracellular pH and attenuates acid load recovery in oligodendroglioma cells. Others have shown that rapid tumor growth cannot occur without NHE-1-mediated neutralization of the acidosis generated by the Warburg glycolytic shift. Our findings show for the first time that the pH regulator NHE-1 can be silenced in a human cancer and also suggest that pH deregulation may contribute to the distinctive biology of human oligodendroglioma."
"Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proven remarkably effective at identifying reliably associated genetic variants, the biology underlying these discoveries is rarely immediately apparent and in most cases seems bound to require extensive fine mapping and functional analysis before it is revealed. In this context, it is logical and appropriate to try to interrogate available genetic data for biological insights. However, because such efforts invariably depend upon mathematical modeling, misperceptions can easily arise if the relevant mathematical properties are overlooked or forgotten. In this report, we will examine these mathematical issues, highlight some of the more common misconceptions, and hopefully help to clarify the somewhat blurry distinction between biology and mathematics that can so easily undermine and obscure the value of GWAS discoveries."
"Over the past 2 decades, functional imaging techniques have become commonplace in the study of brain disease. Nevertheless, very few validated analytical methods have been developed specifically to identify and measure systems-level abnormalities in living patients. Network approaches are particularly relevant for translational research in the neurodegenerative disorders, which often involve stereotyped abnormalities in brain organization. In recent years, spatial covariance mapping, a multivariate analytical tool applied mainly to metabolic images acquired in the resting state, has provided a useful means of objectively assessing brain disorders at the network level. By quantifying network activity in individual subjects on a scan-by-scan basis, this technique makes it possible to objectively assess disease progression and the response to treatment on a system-wide basis. To illustrate the utility of network imaging in neurological research, we review recent applications of this approach in the study of Parkinson disease and related movement disorders. Novel uses of the technique are discussed, including the prediction of cognitive responses to dopaminergic therapy, evaluation of the effects of placebo treatment on network activity, assessment of preclinical disease progression, and the use of automated pattern-based algorithms to enhance diagnostic accuracy."
"This Point of View article addresses neonatal encephalopathy (NE) presumably caused by hypoxia-ischemia and the terminology currently in wide use for this disorder. The nonspecific term NE is commonly utilized for those infants with the clinical and imaging characteristics of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Multiple magnetic resonance imaging studies of term infants with the clinical setting of presumed hypoxia-ischemia near the time of delivery have delineated a topography of lesions highly correlated with that defined by human neuropathology and by animal models, including primate models, of hypoxia-ischemia. These imaging findings, coupled with clinical features consistent with perinatal hypoxic-ischemic insult(s), warrant the specific designation of neonatal HIE."
"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a term used to describe a series of properties possessed by the vasculature of the central nervous system (CNS) that tightly regulate the movement of ions, molecules, and cells between the blood and the CNS. This barrier is crucial to provide the appropriate environment to allow for proper neural function, as well as protect the CNS from injury and disease. In this review, I discuss the cellular and molecular composition of the BBB and how the development and function of the BBB is regulated by interactions with the CNS microenvironment. I further discuss what is known about BBB dysfunction during CNS injury and disease, as well as methodology used to deliver drugs across the BBB to the CNS."
"A substantial number of patients who survive severe brain injury progress to a nonresponsive state of wakeful unawareness, referred to as a vegetative state (VS). They appear to be awake, but show no signs of awareness of themselves, or of their environment in repeated clinical examinations. However, recent neuroimaging research demonstrates that some VS patients can respond to commands by willfully modulating their brain activity according to instruction. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) may allow such patients to circumvent the barriers imposed by their behavioral limitations and communicate with the outside world. However, although such devices would undoubtedly improve the quality of life for some patients and their families, developing BCI systems for behaviorally nonresponsive patients presents substantial technical and clinical challenges. Here we review the state of the art of BCI research across noninvasive neuroimaging technologies, and propose how such systems should be developed further to provide fully fledged communication systems for behaviorally nonresponsive populations."
"Coordinated reset neuromodulation consists of the application of consecutive brief high-frequency pulse trains through the different contacts of the stimulation electrode. In theoretical studies, by achieving unlearning of abnormal connectivity between neurons, coordinated reset neuromodulation reduces pathological synchronization, a hallmark feature of Parkinson's disease pathophysiology. Here we show that coordinated reset neuromodulation of the subthalamic nucleus has both acute and sustained long-lasting aftereffects on motor function in parkinsonian nonhuman primates. Long-lasting aftereffects were not observed with classical deep brain stimulation. These observations encourage further development of coordinated reset neuromodulation for treating motor symptoms in Parkinson disease patients."
"Since the introduction of the Orphan Drug Act in 1983, designed to promote development of treatments for rare diseases, at least 378 orphan drugs have been approved. Incentives include financial support, tax credits, and perhaps most importantly, extended market exclusivity. These incentives have encouraged industry interest and accelerated research on rare diseases, allowing patients with orphan diseases access to treatments. However, extended market exclusivity has been associated with unacceptably high drug costs, both for newly developed drugs and for drugs that were previously widely available. We suggest that a paradoxical effect of orphan product exclusivity can be reduced patient access to existing drugs. In addition, the costs of each new drug are arguably unsustainable for patients and for the American health care system. Of all the specialties, neurology has the third highest number of orphan product designations, and neurological diseases account for at least one-fifth of rare diseases. Citing the use of tetrabenazine for chorea in Huntington disease, adrenocorticotropic hormone for infantile spasms, and enzyme replacement therapy with alglucosidase alpha for Pompe disease, we highlight these paradoxical effects."
"A new protocol suggests that patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are a viable source of tissue for organ transplantation. However, multiple lines of evidence suggest that many neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS, might progress due to transcellular propagation of protein aggregation among neurons. Transmission of the disease state from donor to host thus may be possible under the permissive circumstances of graft transplantation. We argue for careful patient selection and close longitudinal follow-up of recipients when harvesting organs from individuals with neurodegenerative disease, especially dominantly inherited forms."
"The pace of discovery in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) has accelerated dramatically with the discovery of new genetic causes and pathological substrates of the disease. MAPT/tau, GRN/progranulin, and C9ORF72 have emerged as common FTD genes, and TARDBP/TDP-43, VCP, FUS, and CHMP2B have been identified as less common genetic causes. TDP-43 and FUS have joined tau as common neuropathological substrates of the disease. Mouse models provide an important tool for understanding the role of these molecules in FTD pathogenesis. Here, we review recent progress with mouse models based on tau, TDP-43, progranulin, VCP, and CHMP2B. We also consider future prospects for FTD models, including developing new models to address unanswered questions. There are also opportunities for capitalizing on conservation of the salience network, which is selectively vulnerable in FTD, and the availability of FTD-related behavioral paradigms to analyze mouse models of the disease."
"Small-fiber neuropathy (SFN) is characterized by injury to small-diameter peripheral nerve axons and intraepidermal nerve fibers (IENF). Although mechanisms underlying loss of IENF in SFN are poorly understood, available data suggest that it results from axonal degeneration and reduced regenerative capacity. Gain-of-function variants in sodium channel Na(V)1.7 that increase firing frequency and spontaneous firing of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons have recently been identified in &#x223c;30% of patients with idiopathic SFN. In the present study, to determine whether these channel variants can impair axonal integrity, we developed an in vitro assay of DRG neurite length, and examined the effect of 3 SFN-associated variant Na(V)1.7 channels, I228M, M932L/V991L (ML/VL), and I720K, on DRG neurites in vitro. At 3 days after culturing, DRG neurons transfected with I228M channels exhibited &#x223c;20% reduced neurite length compared to wild-type channels; DRG neurons transfected with ML/VL and I720K variants displayed a trend toward reduced neurite length. I228M-induced reduction in neurite length was ameliorated by the use-dependent sodium channel blocker carbamazepine and by a blocker of reverse Na-Ca exchange. These in vitro observations provide evidence supporting a contribution of the I228M variant Na(V)1.7 channel to impaired regeneration and/or degeneration of sensory axons in idiopathic SFN, and suggest that enhanced sodium channel activity and reverse Na-Ca exchange can contribute to a decrease in length of peripheral sensory axons."
"Targeting newly identified damage pathways in the ischemic brain can help to circumvent the currently severe limitations of acute stroke therapy. Here we show that the activity of 12/15-lipoxygenase was increased in the ischemic mouse brain, and 12/15-lipoxygenase colocalized with a marker for oxidized lipids, MDA2. This colocalization was also detected in the brain of 2 human stroke patients, where it also coincided with increased apoptosis-inducing factor. A novel inhibitor of 12/15-lipoxygenase, LOXBlock-1, protected neuronal HT22 cells against oxidative stress. In a mouse model of transient focal ischemia, the inhibitor reduced infarct sizes both 24 hours and 14 days poststroke, with improved behavioral parameters. Even when treatment was delayed until at least 4 hours after onset of ischemia, LOXBlock-1 was protective. Furthermore, it reduced tissue plasminogen activator-associated hemorrhage in a clot model of ischemia/reperfusion. This study establishes inhibition of 12/15-lipoxygenase as a viable strategy for first-line stroke treatment."
"Reperfusion therapy for acute stroke has evolved from the initial use of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within 3 hours of symptom onset to more recent guideline-recommended use up to 4.5 hours. In addition, endovascular therapy is increasingly utilized for stroke treatment and is typically initiated up to 8 hours after onset. Recent studies demonstrate that imaging of the ischemic penumbra with diffusion/perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can identify subgroups of patients who are likely to improve following successful reperfusion (Target Mismatch profile) and others who are at increased risk for hemorrhage and poor clinical outcomes (Malignant profile). New data indicate that stent retriever devices provide better recanalization efficacy and clinical outcomes than the previously available mechanical thrombectomy devices. Going forward, we believe that the use of penumbral imaging with validated MRI techniques, as well as the currently less well-validated computed tomography (CT) perfusion approach, will maximize benefit and reduce the risk of adverse events and poor outcomes when used both early after stroke onset and at later time points. New trials that feature diffusion/perfusion MRI or CT perfusion-based patient selection for treatment with intravenous tPA and or endovascular therapies versus nonreperfused control groups are planned or in progress. We predict that these trials will confirm the hypothesis that penumbral imaging can enhance patient selection and extend the therapeutic time window for acute ischemic stroke."
"Protein aggregation within the central nervous system has been recognized as a defining feature of neurodegenerative diseases since the early 20th century. Since that time, there has been a growing list of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson disease, which are characterized by inclusions of specific pathogenic proteins. This has led to the long-held dogma that these characteristic protein inclusions, which are composed of large insoluble fibrillar protein aggregates and visible by light microscopy, are responsible for cell death in these diseases. However, the correlation between protein inclusion formation and cytotoxicity is inconsistent, suggesting that another form of the pathogenic proteins may be contributing to neurodegeneration. There is emerging evidence implicating soluble oligomers, smaller protein aggregates not detectable by conventional microscopy, as potential culprits in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. The protein &#x3b1;-synuclein is well recognized to contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease and is the major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. However, &#x3b1;-synuclein also forms oligomeric species, with certain conformations being toxic to cells. The mechanisms by which these &#x3b1;-synuclein oligomers cause cell death are being actively investigated, as they may provide new strategies for diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson disease and related disorders. Here we review the possible role of &#x3b1;-synuclein oligomers in cell death in Parkinson disease and discuss the potential clinical implications."
"Temporal delay in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals may be sensitive to perfusion deficits in acute stroke. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) was added to a standard stroke MRI protocol. We calculated the time delay between the BOLD signal at each voxel and the whole-brain signal using time-lagged correlation and compared the results to mean transit time derived using bolus tracking. In all 11 patients, areas exhibiting significant delay in BOLD signal corresponded to areas of hypoperfusion identified by contrast-based perfusion MRI. Time delay analysis of rsfMRI provides information comparable to that of conventional perfusion MRI without the need for contrast agents."
"Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are prone to learning and behavioral abnormalities, including problems with spatial learning and attention. The molecular etiology for these deficits is unclear, as previous studies have implicated defective dopamine, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and Ras homeostasis. Using behavioral, electrophysiological, and primary culture, we now demonstrate that reduced dopamine signaling is responsible for cAMP-dependent defects in neuron function and learning. Collectively, these results establish defective dopaminergic function as a contributing factor underlying impaired spatial learning and memory in children and adults with NF1, and support the use of treatments that restore normal dopamine homeostasis for select individuals."
"Neurologists in the pharmaceutical industry have an attractive and rewarding career path that offers the chance to participate in large projects, contribute directly to clinical breakthroughs in drug development, and translate biomarker research into applied practice. This article describes the different and common features of corporate compared to academic environments, and highlights the key factors necessary for success in the business world. Integrity, communication skills, an open-minded attitude, and an ability to handle stress and manage complex organizational structures are prerequisites that enable physician-neuroscientists to pursue successful and exciting careers in the corporate environment."
"Although traditional models of carcinogenesis have largely focused on neoplastic cells, converging data have revealed the importance of non-neoplastic stromal cells in influencing tumor growth and progression. Leveraging a genetically engineered mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated optic glioma, we now demonstrate that stromal microglia express the CX3CR1 chemokine receptor, such that reduced CX3CR1 expression decreases optic nerve microglia. Moreover, genetic reduction of Cx3cr1 expression in Nf1 optic glioma mice delays optic glioma formation. Coupled with previous findings demonstrating that microglia maintain optic glioma growth, these new findings provide a strong preclinical rationale for the development of future stroma-directed glioma therapies in children."
"Ceruloplasmin is an iron-export ferroxidase that is abundant in plasma and also expressed in glia. We found a &#x223c;80% loss of ceruloplasmin ferroxidase activity in the substantia nigra of idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD) cases, which could contribute to the pro-oxidant iron accumulation that characterizes the pathology. Consistent with a role for ceruloplasmin in PD etiopathogenesis, ceruloplasmin knockout mice developed parkinsonism that was rescued by iron chelation. Additionally, peripheral infusion of ceruloplasmin attenuated neurodegeneration and nigral iron elevation in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine mouse model for PD. These findings show, in principle, that intravenous ceruloplasmin may have therapeutic potential in PD."
"The 2012 ANA Annual Meeting&#x2019;s President&#x2019;s Symposium highlighted developments in the genetics of Alzheimer disease (AD), identification of biomarkers, molecular neuropathology and its impact on brain function, and emerging concepts on the initiation and evolution of disease processes."
"Dystonia type 4 (DYT4) was first described in a large family from Heacham in Norfolk with an autosomal dominantly inherited whispering dysphonia, generalized dystonia, and a characteristic hobby horse ataxic gait. We carried out a genetic linkage analysis in the extended DYT4 family that spanned 7 generations from England and Australia, revealing a single LOD score peak of 6.33 on chromosome 19p13.12-13. Exome sequencing in 2 cousins identified a single cosegregating mutation (p.R2G) in the &#x3b2;-tubulin 4a (TUBB4a) gene that was absent in a large number of controls. The mutation is highly conserved in the &#x3b2;-tubulin autoregulatory MREI (methionine-arginine-glutamic acid-isoleucine) domain, highly expressed in the central nervous system, and extensive in vitro work has previously demonstrated that substitutions at residue 2, specifically R2G, disrupt the autoregulatory capability of the wild-type &#x3b2;-tubulin peptide, affirming the role of the cytoskeleton in dystonia pathogenesis."
"An association has previously been reported between susceptibility to multiple sclerosis and the rare mutant alleles of the CYP27B1 gene responsible for autosomal recessive vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1 (VDDR1). In an attempt to replicate this finding, we screened 495 multiplex families and 2,092 single affected families, together with 4,594 cases and 3,583 controls (a total of 17,073 individuals) but were unable to find any evidence supporting this putative association. Our data do not indicate that mutations responsible for VDDR1 influence the risk of developing multiple sclerosis."
"Association studies have implicated common variants in the 12q14.1 region containing CYP27B1 in multiple sclerosis (MS). Rare CYP27B1 mutations cause autosomal recessive vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1, and it has recently been reported that heterozygous CYP27B1 mutations are associated with increased MS susceptibility and lower active vitamin D levels. By sequencing CYP27B1 in 134 multiplex families and genotyping the most common variant R389H in 2,608 MS patients and 1,987 controls from Italy and Belgium (a total of 4,729 individuals), we were unable to replicate these observations. These results provide evidence against a major role for CYP27B1 mutations in MS."
"Nitric oxide (NO) is a powerful vasodilator, involved in both physiological functions and pathophysiological alterations of various regulatory processes, for example, the maintenance of vascular tone and inflammation. The recently demonstrated impact of exogenous NO on the central nervous system extends its role under normal and pathological conditions. At times neuroprotective, at times neurotoxic, NO is capable of different effects depending upon the extent of cerebral damage, the cellular redox state, and the spatiotemporal coordinates and concentration at which it is synthesized. This review provides new insights into the short- and long-term effects of endogenous and exogenous NO in brain injury."
"Identifying the tests/procedures ordered by neurologists that contribute most to health care expenditures is a critical step in the process of creating the neurology top 5 list for the Choosing Wisely initiative. Using data from the 2007-2010 National Ambulatory Care Medical Survey, we found that $13.3 billion (95% confidence interval = $10.1-$16.5 billion) was spent on tests ordered at neurologist visits. The tests/procedures with the highest expenditures were magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; 51% of total expenditures; $7.5 billion), electromyography (EMG; 20% of expenditures; $2.6 billion), and electroencephalography (EEG; 8% of expenditures; $1.1 billion). MRI, EMG, and EEG should receive close scrutiny in the development of the neurology top 5 list."
"The cervical nerves may play a significant role in primary headache disorders. We reviewed the patterns of pain evoked by stimulation of the first 3 cervical nerves (C1-C3) in 10 patients with chronic occipital pain, 6 of whom also had migraine. Stimulation at the C1 level evoked periorbital and frontal pain in 6 of 6 patients with migraine but evoked occipital or cervical pain in those without migraine. C2 and C3 stimulation resulted in occipital or cervical pain in all patients. The C1 nerve may have an important sensory function in headache disorders that have orbital and frontal pain as a prominent feature."
"Dopamine dysregulation syndrome shares some core behavioral features with psychostimulant addiction, suggesting that dopamine replacement therapy can acquire psychostimulantlike properties in some patients with Parkinson disease (PD). We here report strong experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis in an &#x3b1;-synuclein rat model of PD. Although levodopa had no effect in controls, it acquired 2 prominent psychostimulantlike properties in Parkinsonian rats: (1) it produced intense reward on its own and in parallel (2) decreased interest in other nondrug reward. These 2 effects may combine to explain the addictive use of levodopa after loss of midbrain dopamine neurons in some PD patients."
"We review the current application of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson disease (PD) and consider the evidence that earlier use of DBS confers long-term symptomatic benefit for patients compared to best medical therapy. Electronic searches were performed of PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify all article types relating to the timing of DBS in PD. Current evidence suggests that DBS is typically performed in late stage PD, a mean of 14 to 15 years after diagnosis. Current guidelines recommend that PD patients who are resistant to medical therapies, have significant medication side effects and lengthening off periods, but are otherwise cognitively intact and medically fit for surgery be considered for DBS. If these criteria are rigidly interpreted, it may be that, by the time medical treatment options have been exhausted, the disease has progressed to the point that the patient may no longer be fit for neurosurgical intervention. From the evidence available, we conclude that surgical management of PD alone or in combination with medical therapy results in greater improvement of motor symptoms and quality of life than medical treatment alone. There is evidence to support the use of DBS in less advanced PD and that it may be appropriate for earlier stages of the disease than for which it is currently used. The improving short and long-term safety profile of DBS makes early application a realistic possibility."
"Lafora disease (LD) is a fatal progressive myoclonus epilepsy characterized neuropathologically by aggregates of abnormally structured glycogen and proteins (Lafora bodies [LBs]), and neurodegeneration. Whether LBs could be prevented by inhibiting glycogen synthesis and whether they are pathogenic remain uncertain. We genetically eliminated brain glycogen synthesis in LD mice. This resulted in long-term prevention of LB formation, neurodegeneration, and seizure susceptibility. This study establishes that glycogen synthesis is requisite for LB formation and that LBs are pathogenic. It opens a therapeutic window for potential treatments in LD with known and future small molecule inhibitors of glycogen synthesis."
"Astrocytic necrosis is a prominent pathological feature of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) lesions and is clinically relevant. We report 5 NMO-related cases, all with longitudinally extensive lesions in the upper cervical cord, who underwent cervical cord (1) H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Lower myo-inositol/creatine values, suggesting astrocytic damage, were consistently found within the NMO lesions when compared with healthy controls and patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), who showed at least 1 demyelinating lesion at the same cord level. Therefore, the in vivo quantification of myo-inositol may distinguish NMO from MS. This is an important step toward developing imaging markers for clinical trials in NMO."
"The increasing longevity of patients with congenital and developmental disorders of the nervous system reflects the palliative and social success of pediatrics in the past 2 decades. This success has resulted in an increasing number of adult patients with residua or sequelae of childhood disease and/or its treatment. It is critically important that residencies and subspecialty fellowships train a cadre of physicians to prepare patients and families for the transition of children with special health care needs to adulthood and to attend to their unique medical, psychological, and social concerns. Health services and education research must better define the needs of this growing population and the best ways to educate their physicians and families and empower them to become as independent as their fullest potential allows."
"Among 249 patients with teratoma-associated encephalitis, 211 had N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibodies and 38 were negative for these antibodies. Whereas antibody-positive patients rarely developed prominent brainstem-cerebellar symptoms, 22 (58%) antibody-negative patients developed a brainstem-cerebellar syndrome, which in 45% occurred with opsoclonus. The median age of these patients was 28.5 years (range&#x2009;=&#x2009;12-41), 91% were women, and 74% had full recovery after therapy and tumor resection. These findings uncover a novel phenotype of paraneoplastic opsoclonus that until recently was likely considered idiopathic or postinfectious. The triad of young age (teenager to young adult), systemic teratoma, and high response to treatment characterize this novel brainstem-cerebellar syndrome."
"Prevalence of neuropathic pain is high after major surgery. However, effective treatment for preventing neuropathic pain is lacking. Here we report that perisurgical treatment of neuroprotectin D1/protectin D1 (NPD1/PD1), derived from docosahexaenoic acid, prevents nerve injury-induced mechanical allodynia and ongoing pain in mice. Intrathecal post-treatment of NPD1/PD1 also effectively reduces established neuropathic pain and produces no apparent signs of analgesic tolerance. Mechanistically, NPD1/PD1 treatment blocks nerve injury-induced long-term potentiation, glial reaction, and inflammatory responses, and reverses synaptic plasticity in the spinal cord. Thus, NPD1/PD1 and related mimetics might serve as a new class of analgesics for preventing and treating neuropathic pain."
"We identified a small family with autosomal recessive, infantile onset epilepsy and intellectual disability. Exome sequencing identified a homozygous missense variant in the gene TNK2, encoding a brain-expressed tyrosine kinase. Sequencing of the coding region of TNK2 in 110 patients with a similar phenotype failed to detect further homozygote or compound heterozygote mutations. Pathogenicity of the variant is supported by the results of our functional studies, which demonstrated that the variant abolishes NEDD4 binding to TNK2, preventing its degradation after epidermal growth factor stimulation. Definitive proof of pathogenicity will require confirmation in unrelated patients."
"Approximately 700,000 people in the United States have an ischemic stroke annually. Substantial research has tested therapies for the very early treatment of ischemic stroke but, to date, only intravenous thrombolysis and intra-arterial measures to restore perfusion have shown success. Despite a 15-year effort to increase the use of these therapies, only approximately 5% of patients with stroke are currently being treated. Although most patients with stroke have some neurological recovery, more than half of stroke survivors have residual impairments that lead to disability or long-term institutionalized care. Laboratory research has demonstrated several mechanisms that help the brain to recover after a stroke. New pharmacological and cell-based approaches that are known to promote brain plasticity are emerging from laboratory studies and may soon expand the window for stroke treatment to restore function. It is time to build on this knowledge and to translate the understanding of recovery after stroke into the clinical setting. Measures that might augment recovery should become a major focus of clinical research in stroke in the 21st century."
"Genetic testing for intellectual disability, global developmental delay and other neurodevelopmental disorders has advanced considerably in the last five to ten years and can be an important diagnostic tool for clinicians. This article provides a clinical and ethical framework for understanding these advances, future directions and the current limitations of these approaches."
"Glycogen storage diseases are important causes of myopathy and cardiomyopathy. We describe 10 patients from 8 families with childhood or juvenile onset of myopathy, 8 of whom also had rapidly progressive cardiomyopathy, requiring heart transplant in 4. The patients were homozygous or compound heterozygous for missense or truncating mutations in RBCK1, which encodes for a ubiquitin ligase, and had extensive polyglucosan accumulation in skeletal muscle and in the heart in cases of cardiomyopathy. We conclude that RBCK1 deficiency is a frequent cause of polyglucosan storage myopathy associated with progressive muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy."
"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is the most common clinical presentation of JC virus (JCV)-associated central nervous system (CNS) disease and has emerged as a major safety concern in multiple sclerosis patients treated with the monoclonal antibody natalizumab. Here we report clinical, radiological, and histological findings of a case of cerebellar granule cell neuronopathy (GCN), a JCV-associated CNS disease, so far unreported amongst patients treated with natalizumab. GCN should be considered as a JCV CNS manifestation in patients with newly developed, progressive cerebellar signs under natalizumab treatment, especially in cases where cerebellar atrophy can be visualized by magnetic resonance imaging."
"The metabolic syndrome and neuropathy are common conditions, especially in the elderly, that are associated with significant morbidity. Furthermore, the metabolic syndrome is reaching epidemic proportions across the world. Current evidence supports the association of the metabolic syndrome and its individual components with neuropathy. Several clinical trials have demonstrated that treating hyperglycemia, a component of the metabolic syndrome, has a significant effect on reducing the incidence of neuropathy in those with type 1 diabetes. However, glucose control has only a marginal effect on preventing neuropathy in those with type 2 diabetes, suggesting that other factors may be driving nerve injury in these patients. Emerging evidence supports the metabolic syndrome as including risk factors for neuropathy. Interventions exist for treatment of all of the metabolic syndrome components, but only glucose control has strong evidence to support its use and is widely employed. Our understanding of the biology of metabolic nerve injury has rapidly expanded over the past several years. Mechanisms of injury include fatty deposition in nerves, extracellular protein glycation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Additionally, the activation of counter-regulatory signaling pathways leads to chronic metabolic inflammation. Medications that target these signaling pathways are being used for a variety of diseases and are intriguing therapeutic agents for future neuropathy clinical trials. As we move forward, we need to expand our understanding of the association between the metabolic syndrome and neuropathy by addressing limitations of previous studies. Just as importantly, we must continue to investigate the pathophysiology of metabolically induced nerve injury."
"Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathies are inherited neuromuscular disorders caused by a length-dependent neurodegeneration of peripheral nerves. More than 900 mutations in 60 different genes are causative of the neuropathy. Despite significant progress in therapeutic strategies, the disease remains incurable. The increasing number of genes linked to the disease, and their considerable clinical and genetic heterogeneity render the development of these strategies particularly challenging. In this context, cellular and animals models provide powerful tools. Efficient motor and sensory tests have been developed to assess the behavioral phenotype in transgenic animal models (rodent and fly). When these models reproduce a phenotype comparable to CMT, they allow therapeutic approaches and the discovery of modifiers and biomarkers. In this review, we describe the most convincing transgenic rodent and fly models of CMT and how they can lead to clinical trial. We also discuss the challenges that the research, the clinic, and the pharmaceutical industry will face in developing efficient and accessible treatment for CMT patients."
"The muscular dystrophies comprise a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders that produce progressive skeletal muscle weakness and wasting. There has been rapid growth and change in our understanding of these disorders in recent years, and advances in basic science are being translated into increasing numbers of clinical trials. This review will discuss therapeutic developments in 3 of the most common forms of muscular dystrophy: Duchenne muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy. Each of these disorders represents a different class of genetic disease (monogenic, epigenetic, and repeat expansion disorders), and the approach to therapy addresses the diverse and complex molecular mechanisms involved in these diseases. The large number of novel pharmacologic agents in development with good biologic rationale and strong proof of concept suggests there will be an improved quality of life for individuals with muscular dystrophy."
"We review recent advances in the treatment and prevention of acute ischemic stroke, including the current state of endovascular therapy, in light of 5 randomized controlled trials published this past year. Although no benefit of endovascular therapy over intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has been demonstrated, endovascular therapy is an appropriate treatment for acute ischemic stroke patients within the t-PA window who are ineligible for IV t-PA but have a large vascular occlusion. These trials reveal promises and current limitations of endovascular therapy, and comparison of reperfusion therapies remains an important area of research. One common theme is the strong association between a faster time to reperfusion, improved outcome, and reduced mortality. Primary and secondary stroke prevention trials emphasize the importance of aggressive management of medical risk factors as part of any preventative strategy. New oral anticoagulants, for example, offer cost-effective risk reduction in patients with atrial fibrillation, and may represent an opportunity for those with cryptogenic stroke. We highlight areas of unmet need and promising research in stroke, including the need to deliver proven therapies to more patients, and the need to recruit patients into clinical trials that better define the role of endovascular and other stroke therapies. Finally, improvement in strategies to recover speech, cognition, and motor function has the potential to benefit far more stroke patients than any acute stroke therapy, and represents the greatest opportunity for research in the coming century."
"The field of neurorehabilitation aims to translate neuroscience research toward the goal of maximizing functional recovery after neurological injury. A growing body of research indicates that the fundamental principles of neurological rehabilitation are applicable to a broad range of congenital, degenerative, and acquired neurological disorders. In this perspective, we will focus on motor recovery after acquired brain injuries such as stroke. Over the past few decades, a large body of basic and clinical research has created an experimental and theoretical foundation for approaches to neurorehabilitation. Recent randomized clinical trials all emphasize the requirement for intense progressive rehabilitation programs to optimally enhance recovery. Moreover, advances in multimodal assessment of patients with neuroimaging and neurophysiological tools suggest the possibility of individualized treatment plans based on recovery potential. There are also promising indications for medical as well as noninvasive brain stimulation paradigms to facilitate recovery. Ongoing or planned clinical studies should provide more definitive evidence. We also highlight unmet needs and potential areas of research. Continued research built upon a robust experimental and theoretical foundation should help to develop novel treatments to improve recovery after neurological injury."
"In neurodegenerative disorders, effective treatments are urgently needed, along with methods to determine whether treatment worked. In this review, we discuss the rapid progress in the understanding of recessive proximal spinal muscular atrophy and how this is leading to exciting potential treatments of the disease. Spinal muscular atrophy is caused by loss of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene and reduced levels of SMN protein. The critical downstream targets of SMN deficiency that result in motor neuron loss are not known. However, increasing SMN levels has a marked impact in mouse models, and these therapeutics are rapidly moving toward clinical trials. Promising preclinical therapies, the varying degree of impact on the mouse models, and potential measures of treatment effect are reviewed. One key issue discussed is the variable outcome of increasing SMN at different stages of disease progression."
"Migraine is a common, complex brain disorder whose biology is becoming better understood. Despite being the most disabling of the neurological disorders on a worldwide basis, headache disorders broadly, and migraine in particular, have poor research funding and a limited academic base. Given a modicum of investment, new targets, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide-based mechanisms, and entirely novel neuromodulation approaches illustrate that much can be done to improve patient care. Genetics and neuroimaging combined with excellent clinical phenotyping and translational neuroscience approaches are set to transform life for a cohort of patients with these common brain disorders."
"This is a critical time in neurotherapeutics. The prevalence of neurological disease, such as dementia, stroke, and peripheral neuropathy, is large and growing consequent to the aging population. The personal and societal impact of these disorders is enormous, and the number of novel therapies in the pipeline for these disorders has been contracting. Support for the development of neurotherapies must continue from the bench to their ultimate place at the bedside. Academic medicine must continue to play a critical role, in league with industry and government, in the development of novel neurotherapies desperately needed by an ever-expanding population. Critical steps include the identification and adoption of reliable, valid, and reproducible biomarkers to serve as primary endpoints in clinical trials of neurological disease."
"The development of new therapeutics for sleep disorders is increasingly dependent upon understanding the basic brain circuitry that underlies sleep-wake regulation, and how it may be pharmacologically manipulated. In this review, we consider the pathophysiological basis of major sleep disorders that often are seen by neurologists, including excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, narcolepsy, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and restless legs syndrome, as well as circadian disorders, and we review the current and potential future therapeutic approaches."
"Intellectual disability is common and is associated with significant morbidity. Until the latter half of the 20th century, there were no efficacious treatments. Following initial breakthroughs associated with newborn screening and metabolic corrections, little progress was made until recently. With improved understanding of genetic and cellular mechanisms, novel treatment options are beginning to appear for a number of specific conditions. Fragile X and tuberous sclerosis offer paradigms for the development of targeted therapeutics, but advances in understanding of other disorders such as Down syndrome and Rett syndrome, for example, are also resulting in promising treatment directions. In addition, better understanding of the underlying neurobiology is leading to novel developments in enzyme replacement for storage disorders and adjunctive therapies for metabolic disorders, as well as potentially more generalizable approaches that target dysfunctional cell regulation via RNA and chromatin. Physiologic therapies, including deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation, offer yet another direction to enhance cognitive functioning. Current options and evolving opportunities for the intellectually disabled are reviewed and exemplified."
"Injuries to central nervous system axons result not only in Wallerian degeneration of the axon distal to the injury, but also in death or atrophy of the axotomized neurons, depending on injury location and neuron type. No method of permanently avoiding these changes has been found, despite extensive knowledge concerning mechanisms of secondary neuronal injury. The autonomous endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway in neurons has recently been implicated in retrograde neuronal degeneration. In addition to the emerging role of ER morphology in axon maintenance, we propose that ER stress is a common neuronal response to disturbances in axon integrity and a general mechanism for neurodegeneration. Thus, manipulation of the ER stress pathway could have important therapeutic implications for neuroprotection."
"We have entered a golden era in multiple sclerosis (MS) research. Two decades ago, our understanding of the disease was largely descriptive and there were no approved therapies to modify the natural history of MS. Today, delineation of immune pathways relevant to MS have been clarified; a comprehensive map of genes that influence risk compiled; clues to environmental triggers identified; noninvasive in vivo monitoring of the MS disease process has been revolutionized by high-field MRI; and many effective therapies for the early, relapsing, component of MS now exist. However, major challenges remain. We still have no useful treatment for progressive MS (the holy grail of MS research), no means to repair injured axons or protect neurons, and extremely limited evidence to guide treatment decisions. Recent advances have set in place a foundation for development of increasingly selective immunotherapy for patients; application of genetic and genomic discoveries to improve therapeutic options; development of remyelination or neuroprotection therapies for progressive MS; and integrating clinical, imaging and genomic data for personalized medicine. MS has now advanced from the backwaters of autoimmune disease research to the front-line, and definitive answers, including cures, are now realistic goals for the next decade. Many of the breakthrough discoveries in MS have also resulted from meaningful interactions across disciplines, and especially from translational and basic scientists working closely with clinicians, highlighting that the clinical value of discoveries are most often revealed when ideas developed in the laboratory are tested at the bedside."
