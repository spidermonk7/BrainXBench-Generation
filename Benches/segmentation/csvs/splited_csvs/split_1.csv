Abstract
"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder typified by the presence of intraneuronal inclusions containing aggregated alpha synuclein (&#x3b1;syn). The progression of parkinsonian pathology and clinical phenotype has been broadly demonstrated to follow a specific pattern, most notably described by Braak and colleagues. In more recent times it has been hypothesized that &#x3b1;syn itself may be a critical factor in mediating transmission of disease pathology from one brain area to another. Here we investigate the growing body of evidence demonstrating the ability of &#x3b1;syn to spread transcellularly and induce pathological aggregation affecting neurons by permissive templating and provide a critical analysis of some irregularities in the hypothesis that the progression of PD pathology may be mediated by such a prion-like process. Finally we discuss some key questions that remain unanswered which are vital to determining the potential contribution of a prion-like process to the pathogenesis of PD."
"Monosomy 1p36 is the most common subtelomeric chromosomal deletion linked to mental retardation and seizures. Neuroimaging studies suggest that monosomy 1p36 is associated with brain malformations including polymicrogyria and nodular heterotopia, but the histopathology of these lesions is unknown. Here we present postmortem neuropathological findings from a 10 year-old girl with monosomy 1p36, who died of respiratory complications. The findings included micrencephaly, periventricular nodular heterotopia in occipitotemporal lobes, cortical dysgenesis resembling polymicrogyria in dorsolateral frontal lobes, hippocampal malrotation, callosal hypoplasia, superiorly rotated cerebellum with small vermis, and lumbosacral hydromyelia. The abnormal cortex exhibited ""festooned"" (undulating) supragranular layers, but no significant fusion of the molecular layer. Deletion mapping demonstrated single copy loss of a contiguous 1p36 terminal region encompassing many important neurodevelopmental genes, among them four HES genes implicated in regulating neural stem cell differentiation, and TP73, a monoallelically expressed gene. Our results suggest that brain and spinal malformations in monosomy 1p36 may be more extensive than previously recognized, and may depend on the parental origin of deleted genes. More broadly, our results suggest that specific genetic disorders may cause distinct forms of cortical dysgenesis."
"For the last 20&#xa0;years, the ""amyloid cascade hypothesis"" has dominated research aimed at understanding, preventing, and curing Alzheimer's disease (AD). During that time researchers have acquired an enormous amount of data and have been successful, more than 300 times, in curing the disease in animal model systems by treatments aimed at clearing amyloid deposits. However, to date similar strategies have not been successful in human AD patients. Hence, before rushing into further clinical trials with compounds that aim at lowering amyloid-beta (A&#x3b2;) levels in increasingly younger people, it would be of highest priority to re-assess the initial assumption that accumulation of A&#x3b2; in the brain is the primary pathological event driving AD. Here we question this assumption by highlighting experimental evidence in support of the alternative hypothesis suggesting that APP and A&#x3b2; are part of a neuronal stress/injury system, which is up-regulated to counteract inflammation/oxidative stress-associated neurodegeneration that could be triggered by a brain injury, chronic infections, or a systemic disease. In AD, this protective program may be overridden by genetic and other risk factors, or its maintenance may become dysregulated during aging. Here, we provide a hypothetical example of a hypothesis-driven correlation between car accidents and airbag release in analogy to the evolution of the amyloid focus and as a way to offer a potential explanation for the failure of the AD field to translate the success of amyloid-related therapeutic strategies in experimental models to the clinic."
"Changes in protein metabolism are key to disease onset and progression in many neurodegenerative diseases. As a prime example, in Parkinson's disease, folding, post-translational modification and recycling of the synaptic protein &#x3b1;-synuclein are clearly altered, leading to a progressive accumulation of pathogenic protein species and the formation of intracellular inclusion bodies. Altered protein folding is one of the first steps of an increasingly understood cascade in which &#x3b1;-synuclein forms complex oligomers and finally distinct protein aggregates, termed Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. In neurons, an elaborated network of chaperone and co-chaperone proteins is instrumental in mediating protein folding and re-folding. In addition to their direct influence on client proteins, chaperones interact with protein degradation pathways such as the ubiquitin-proteasome-system or autophagy in order to ensure the effective removal of irreversibly misfolded and potentially pathogenic proteins. Because of the vital role of proper protein folding for protein homeostasis, a growing number of studies have evaluated the contribution of chaperone proteins to neurodegeneration. We herein review our current understanding of the involvement of chaperones, co-chaperones and chaperone-mediated autophagy in synucleinopathies with a focus on the Hsp90 and Hsp70 chaperone system. We discuss genetic and pathological studies in Parkinson's disease as well as experimental studies in models of synucleinopathies that explore molecular chaperones and protein degradation pathways as a novel therapeutic target. To this end, we examine the capacity of chaperones to prevent or modulate neurodegeneration and summarize the current progress in models of Parkinson's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders."
"A novel point mutation resulting in a glutamate-to-glycine substitution in PRNP at codon 200, E200G with codon 129 MV polymorphism (cis valine) and type 2 PrPSc was identified in a patient with a prolonged disease course leading to pathology-proven Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease. Despite the same codon as the most common genetic form of human PRNP mutation, E200K, this novel mutation (E200G) presented with a different clinical and pathological phenotype, including prolonged duration, large vacuoles, no vacuolation in the hippocampus, severe neuronal loss in the thalamus, mild cerebellar involvement, and abundant punctate linear and curvilinear deposition of PrPSc in synaptic boutons and axonal terminals along the dendrites."
"We report the case of a 75-year-old ex-professional boxer who developed diplopia and eye movement abnormalities in his 60's followed by memory impairment, low mood and recurrent falls. Examination shortly before death revealed hypomimia, dysarthria, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy and impaired postural reflexes. Pathological examination demonstrated 4-repeat tau neuronal and glial lesions, including tufted astrocytes, consistent with a diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy. In addition, neurofibrillary tangles composed of mixed 3-repeat and 4-repeat tau and astrocytic tangles in a distribution highly suggestive of chronic traumatic encephalopathy were observed together with limbic TDP-43 pathology. Possible mechanisms for the co-occurrence of these two tau pathologies are discussed."
"Several morphometric studies have revealed smaller than normal neurons in the neocortex of autistic subjects. To test the hypothesis that abnormal neuronal growth is a marker of an autism-associated global encephalopathy, neuronal volumes were estimated in 16 brain regions, including various subcortical structures, Ammon's horn, archicortex, cerebellum, and brainstem in 14 brains from individuals with autism 4 to 60&#xa0;years of age and 14 age-matched control brains. This stereological study showed a significantly smaller volume of neuronal soma in 14 of 16 regions in the 4- to 8-year-old autistic brains than in the controls. Arbitrary classification revealed a very severe neuronal volume deficit in 14.3% of significantly altered structures, severe in 50%, moderate in 21.4%, and mild in 14.3% structures. This pattern suggests desynchronized neuronal growth in the interacting neuronal networks involved in the autistic phenotype. The comparative study of the autistic and control subject brains revealed that the number of structures with a significant volume deficit decreased from 14 in the 4- to 8-year-old autistic subjects to 4 in the 36- to 60-year-old. Neuronal volumes in 75% of the structures examined in the older adults with autism are comparable to neuronal volume in age-matched controls. This pattern suggests defects of neuronal growth in early childhood and delayed up-regulation of neuronal growth during adolescence and adulthood reducing neuron soma volume deficit in majority of examined regions. However, significant correction of neuron size but limited clinical improvements suggests that delayed correction does not restore functional deficits."
"A major neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the deposition of amyloid plaques in the brains of affected individuals. Amyloid plaques mainly consist of fibrillar &#x3b2;-amyloid, which is a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein. The amyloid-cascade-hypothesis postulates A&#x3b2; accumulation as the central event in initiating a toxic cascade leading to Alzheimer's disease pathology and, ultimately, loss of cognitive function. We studied the kinetics of &#x3b2;-amyloid deposition in Tg2576 mice, which overexpress human amyloid precursor protein with the Swedish mutation. Utilizing long-term two-photon imaging we were able to observe the entire kinetics of plaque growth in vivo. Essentially, we observed that plaque growth follows a sigmoid-shaped curve comprising a cubic growth phase, followed by saturation. In contrast, plaque density kinetics exhibited an asymptotic progression. Taking into account the fact that a critical concentration of A&#x3b2; is required to seed new plaques, we can propose the following kinetic model of &#x3b2;-amyloid deposition in vivo. In the early cubic phase, plaque growth is not limited by A&#x3b2; concentration and plaque density increases very fast. During the transition phase, plaque density stabilizes whereas plaque volume increases strongly reflecting a robust growth of the plaques. In the late asymptotic phase, A&#x3b2; peptide production becomes rate-limiting for plaque growth. In conclusion, the present study offers a direct link between in vitro and in vivo studies facilitating the translation of A&#x3b2;-lowering strategies from laboratory models to patients."
"Dura mater graft-associated Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (dCJD) can be divided into two subgroups that exhibit distinct clinical and neuropathological features, with the majority represented by a non-plaque-type of dCJD (np-dCJD) and the minority by a plaque-type of dCJD (p-dCJD). The two distinct phenotypes of dCJD had been considered to be unrelated to the genotype (methionine, M or valine, V) at polymorphic codon 129 of the PRNP gene or type (type 1 or type 2) of abnormal isoform of prion protein (PrPSc) in the brain, while these are major determinants of clinicopathological phenotypes of sporadic CJD (sCJD). The reason for the existence of two distinct subgroups in dCJD had remained elusive. Recent progress in research of the pathogenesis of dCJD has revealed that two distinct subgroups of dCJD are caused by infection with different PrPSc strains from sCJD, i.e., np-dCJD caused by infection with sCJD-MM1/MV1, and p-dCJD caused by infection with sCJD-VV2 or -MV2. These studies have also revealed previously unrecognized problems as follows: (i) the numbers of p-dCJD patients may increase in the future, (ii) the potential risks of secondary infection from dCJD, particularly from p-dCJD, may be considerable, and (iii) the effectiveness of the current PrPSc decontamination procedures against the PrPSc from p-dCJD is uncertain. To prevent secondary infection from p-dCJD, the establishment of effective decontamination procedures is an urgent issue. In this review, we summarize the past and future problems surrounding dCJD."
"The RNA/DNA-binding protein, TDP-43, is the key component of ubiquitinated inclusions characteristic of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the majority of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP) referred to collectively as TDP-43 proteinopathies. To further elucidate mechanisms of pathological TDP-43 processing and identify TDP-43 epitopes that could be useful as potential biomarkers of TDP-43 proteinopathies, we developed a panel of novel monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed at regions extending across the length of TDP-43. Here, we confirm previous observations that there is no or minimal accumulation of TDP-43&#xa0;N-terminal domains in neocortical inclusions in human TDP-43 proteinopathy tissues and we identify a subset of these MAbs that are specific for human versus mouse TDP-43. Notably, one of these MAbs recognized an epitope that preferentially detected pathological TDP-43 inclusions with negligible reactivity for normal nuclear TDP-43 resembling anti-phospho-TDP-43 specific antibodies that only bind pathological TDP-43. Hence, we infer that this new MAb recognizes a phosphorylation independent but disease-specific pathologic conformation in abnormal TDP-43. These data suggest that the novel MAbs reported here will be useful for patient-oriented research as well as for studies of animal and cell-based models of TDP-43 proteinopathies including ALS and FTLD-TDP."
"Synaptic dysfunction and synapse loss are key features of Alzheimer's pathogenesis. Previously, we showed an essential function of APP and APLP2 for synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Here, we used organotypic hippocampal cultures to investigate the specific role(s) of APP family members and their fragments for dendritic complexity and spine formation of principal neurons within the hippocampus. Whereas CA1 neurons from APLP1-KO or APLP2-KO mice showed normal neuronal morphology and spine density, APP-KO mice revealed a highly reduced dendritic complexity in mid-apical dendrites. Despite unaltered morphology of APLP2-KO neurons, combined APP/APLP2-DKO mutants showed an additional branching defect in proximal apical dendrites, indicating redundancy and a combined function of APP and APLP2 for dendritic architecture. Remarkably, APP-KO neurons showed a pronounced decrease in spine density and reductions in the number of mushroom spines. No further decrease in spine density, however, was detectable in APP/APLP2-DKO mice. Mechanistically, using APPs&#x3b1;-KI mice lacking transmembrane APP and expressing solely the secreted APPs&#x3b1; fragment we demonstrate that APPs&#x3b1; expression alone is sufficient to prevent the defects in spine density observed in APP-KO mice. Collectively, these studies reveal a combined role of APP and APLP2 for dendritic architecture and a unique function of secreted APPs for spine density."
"Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common pediatric malignant brain cancer, typically arises as pathological result of deregulated developmental pathways, including the NOTCH signaling cascade. Unlike the evidence supporting a role for NOTCH receptors in MB development, the pathological functions of NOTCH ligands remain largely unexplored. By examining the expression in large cohorts of MB primary tumors, and in established in vitro MB models, this research study demonstrates that MB cells bear abnormal levels of distinct NOTCH ligands. We explored the potential association between NOTCH ligands and the clinical outcome of MB patients, and investigated the rational of inhibiting NOTCH signaling by targeting specific ligands to ultimately provide therapeutic benefits in MB. The research revealed a significant over-expression of ligand JAG1 in the vast majority of MBs, and proved that JAG1 mediates pro-proliferative signals via activation of NOTCH2 receptor and induction of HES1 expression, thus representing an attractive therapeutic target. Furthermore, we could identify a clinically relevant association between ligand JAG2 and the oncogene MYC, specific for MYC-driven Group 3 MB cases. We describe for the first time a mechanistic link between the oncogene MYC and NOTCH pathway in MB, by identifying JAG2 as MYC target, and by showing that MB cells acquire induced expression of JAG2 through MYC-induced transcriptional activation. Finally, the positive correlation of MYC and JAG2 also with aggressive anaplastic tumors and highly metastatic MB stages suggested that high JAG2 expression may be useful as additional marker to identify aggressive MBs."
"Neurocutaneous melanosis (NCM) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the association of large and/or multiple congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) of the skin with melanocytic lesions of the leptomeninges, including melanocytosis. Leptomeningeal melanocytosis carries a poor prognosis once neurological symptoms develop. Despite surgery, which is often not radical, few other treatment options exist. Recently, it was demonstrated that early embryonic, post-zygotic somatic mutations in the NRAS gene are implicated in the pathogenesis of NCM.In this report, we present a 13-year-old boy with NCM and progressive symptomatic leptomeningeal melanocytosis. A somatic NRASQ61K mutation was present in both CMN as well as the melanocytosis. Despite repeated surgery, the patient showed clinical progression. Therefore, treatment with MEK162, a MEK inhibitor, was started on compassionate use base. The patient died only five days later, i.e. too early to expect a clinical effect of MEK162 therapy. We therefore studied the effect of MEK162 at the protein level in the leptomeningeal tumor by immunohistochemical and Western Blot analyses using Ki67 and pERK antibodies. We observed lower MIB-1 expression and lower pERK expression in the post-treatment samples compared to pre-treatment, suggesting a potential effect of MEK inhibiting therapy. Further studies are needed to determine whether MEK inhibitors can effectively target NRAS-mutated symptomatic NCM, a rare but potentially fatal disease."
"Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHL) is a fulminant demyelinating disease of unknown etiology. Most cases are fatal within one week from onset. AHL pathology varies with the acuteness of disease. Hemorrhages, vessel fibrinoid necrosis, perivascular fibrin exudation, edema and neutrophilic inflammation are early features, while perivascular demyelination, microglial foci and myelin-laden macrophages appear later. Reactive astrocytosis is not present in early hemorrhagic non-demyelinated lesions, but is seen in older lesions. This case report presents the pathology of an AHL case with fulminant course and fatal outcome within 48 hours from presentation. Severe hemorrhages, edema and neutrophilic inflammation in the absence of circumscribed perivascular demyelination affected the temporal neocortex and white matter, hippocampus, cerebellar cortex and white matter, optic chiasm, mammillary bodies, brainstem, cranial nerve roots and leptomeninges. Perivascular end-feet and parenchymal processes of astrocytes exhibited impressive swelling in haemorrhagic but non-demyelinated white matter regions. Astrocytes were dystrophic and displayed degenerating processes. Astrocytic swellings and remnants were immunoreactive for aquaporin-4, aquaporin-1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein. These morphological changes of astrocytes consistent with injury were also observed in haemorrhagic and normal appearing cortex. Our findings reinforce that perivascular demyelination is not present early in AHL. This is the first study that highlights the early and widespread astrocytic injury in the absence of demyelination in AHL, suggesting that, similarly to neuromyelitis optica and central pontine myelinolysis, demyelination in AHL is secondary to astrocyte injury."
"Greater than 160 missense mutations in copper-zinc superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) can cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These mutations produce conformational changes that reveal novel antibody binding epitopes. A monoclonal antibody, clone C4F6 - raised against the ALS variant G93A of SOD1, has been identified as specifically recognizing a conformation shared by many ALS mutants of SOD1. Attempts to determine whether non-mutant SOD1 adopts a C4F6-reactive conformation in spinal tissues of sporadic ALS (sALS) patients has produced inconsistent results. To define the epitope recognized by C4F6, we tested its binding to a panel of recombinant ALS-SOD1 proteins expressed in cultured cells, producing data to suggest that the C4F6 epitope minimally contains amino acids 90-93, which are normally folded into a tight hairpin loop. Multiple van der Waals interactions between the 90-93 loop and a loop formed by amino acids 37-42, particularly a leucine at position 38, form a stable structure termed the &#x3b2;-plug. Based on published modeling predictions, we suggest that the binding of C4F6 to multiple ALS mutants of SOD1 occurs when the local structure within the &#x3b2;-plug, including the loop at 90-93, is destabilized. In using the antibody to stain tissues from transgenic mice or humans, the specificity of the antibody for ALS mutant SOD1 was influenced by antigen retrieval protocols. Using conditions that showed the best discrimination between normal and misfolded mutant SOD1 in cell and mouse models, we could find no obvious difference in C4F6 reactivity to spinal motor neurons between sALS and controls tissues."
"Pathological aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau and subsequent accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) or other tau-containing inclusions are defining histopathological features of many neurodegenerative diseases, which are collectively known as tauopathies. Due to conflicting results regarding a correlation between the presence of NFTs and disease progression, the mechanism linking pathological tau aggregation with cell death is poorly understood. An emerging view is that NFTs are not the toxic entity in tauopathies; rather, tau intermediates between monomers and NFTs are pathogenic. Several proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as &#x3b2;-amyloid (A&#x3b2;) and &#x3b1;-synuclein, have the tendency to form pore-like amyloid structures (annular protofibrils, APFs) that mimic the membrane-disrupting properties of pore-forming protein toxins. The present study examined the similarities of tau APFs with other tau amyloid species and showed for the first time the presence of tau APFs in brain tissue from patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), as well as in the P301L mouse model, which overexpresses mutated tau. Furthermore, we found that APFs are preceded by tau oligomers and do not go on to form NFTs, evading fibrillar fate. Collectively, our results demonstrate that in vivo APF formation depends on mutations in tau, phosphorylation levels, and cell type. These findings establish the pathological significance of tau APFs in vivo and highlight their suitability as therapeutic targets for several neurodegenerative tauopathies."
"Numerous studies have implicated the abnormal accumulation of intraneuronal amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) as an important contributor to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, capable of triggering neuroinflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive deficits. However, the occurrence and pathological relevance of intracellular A&#x3b2; remain a matter of controversial debate. In this study, we have used a multidimensional approach including high-magnification and super-resolution microscopy, cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) mass spectrometry analysis and ELISA to investigate the A&#x3b2; pathology and its associated cognitive impairments, in a novel transgenic rat model overexpressing human APP. Our microscopy studies with quantitative co-localization analysis revealed the presence of intraneuronal A&#x3b2; in transgenic rats, with an immunological signal that was clearly distinguished from that of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its C-terminal fragments (CTFs). The early intraneuronal pathology was accompanied by a significant elevation of soluble A&#x3b2;42 peptides that paralleled the presence and progression of early cognitive deficits, several months prior to amyloid plaque deposition. A&#x3b2;38, A&#x3b2;39, A&#x3b2;40 and A&#x3b2;42 peptides were detected in the rat CSF by MALDI-MS analysis even at the plaque-free stages; suggesting that a combination of intracellular and soluble extracellular A&#x3b2; may be responsible for impairing cognition at early time points. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the intraneuronal development of AD-like amyloid pathology includes a mixture of molecular species (A&#x3b2;, APP and CTFs) of which a considerable component is A&#x3b2;; and that the early presence of these species within neurons has deleterious effects in the CNS, even before the development of full-blown AD-like pathology."
"Intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) - a characteristic pathological feature of Alzheimer's and several other neurodegenerative diseases - are considered a major target for drug development. Tangle load correlates well with the severity of cognitive symptoms and mouse models of tauopathy are behaviorally impaired. However, there is little evidence that NFTs directly impact physiological properties of host neurons. Here we used a transgenic mouse model of tauopathy to study how advanced tau pathology in different brain regions affects activity-driven expression of immediate-early gene Arc required for experience-dependent consolidation of long-term memories. We demonstrate in vivo that visual cortex neurons with tangles are as likely to express comparable amounts of Arc in response to structured visual stimulation as their neighbors without tangles. Probability of experience-dependent Arc response was not affected by tau tangles in both visual cortex and hippocampal pyramidal neurons as determined postmortem. Moreover, whole brain analysis showed that network-wide activity-driven Arc expression was not affected by tau pathology in any of the brain regions, including brain areas with the highest tangle load. Our findings suggest that intraneuronal NFTs do not affect signaling cascades leading to experience-dependent gene expression required for long-term synaptic plasticity."
"Mid-life obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) confer a modest, increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), though the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We have created a novel mouse model that recapitulates features of T2DM and AD by crossing morbidly obese and diabetic db/db mice with APP&#x394;NL/&#x394;NLx PS1P264L/P264L knock-in mice. These mice (db/AD) retain many features of the parental lines (e.g. extreme obesity, diabetes, and parenchymal deposition of &#x3b2;-amyloid (A&#x3b2;)). The combination of the two diseases led to additional pathologies-perhaps most striking of which was the presence of severe cerebrovascular pathology, including aneurysms and small strokes. Cortical A&#x3b2; deposition was not significantly increased in the diabetic mice, though overall expression of presenilin was elevated. Surprisingly, A&#x3b2; was not deposited in the vasculature or removed to the plasma, and there was no stimulation of activity or expression of major A&#x3b2;-clearing enzymes (neprilysin, insulin degrading enzyme, or endothelin-converting enzyme). The db/AD mice displayed marked cognitive impairment in the Morris Water Maze, compared to either db/db or APP&#x394;NLx PS1P264L mice. We conclude that the diabetes and/or obesity in these mice leads to a destabilization of the vasculature, leading to strokes and that this, in turn, leads to a profound cognitive impairment and that this is unlikely to be directly dependent on A&#x3b2; deposition. This model of mixed or vascular dementia provides an exciting new avenue of research into the mechanisms underlying the obesity-related risk for age-related dementia, and will provide a useful tool for the future development of therapeutics."
"Peripheral biomarkers play an indispensable role in quick and reliable diagnoses of any kind of disease. With the population ageing, the number of people suffering from age-related diseases is expected to rise dramatically over the coming decades. In particular, all types of cognitive deficits, such as Alzheimer's disease, will increase. Alzheimer's disease is characterised mainly by coexistence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in brain. Reliable identification of such molecular characteristics antemortem, however, is problematic due to restricted availability of appropriate sample material and definitive diagnosis is only possible postmortem. Currently, the best molecular biomarkers available for antemortem diagnosis originate from cerebrospinal fluid. Though, this is not convenient for routine diagnosis because of the required invasive lumbar puncture. As a consequence, there is a growing demand for additional peripheral biomarkers in a more readily accessible sample material. Blood platelets, due to shared biochemical properties with neurons, can constitute an attractive alternative as discussed here. This review summarises potential platelet Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, their role, implication, and alteration in the disease. For easy comparison of their performance, the Hedge effect size was calculated whenever data were available."
"Complex cortical malformations associated with mutations in tubulin genes are commonly referred to as ""Tubulinopathies"". To further characterize the mutation frequency and phenotypes associated with tubulin mutations, we studied a cohort of 60 foetal cases. Twenty-six tubulin mutations were identified, of which TUBA1A mutations were the most prevalent (19 cases), followed by TUBB2B (6 cases) and TUBB3 (one case). Three subtypes clearly emerged. The most frequent (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;13) was microlissencephaly with corpus callosum agenesis, severely hypoplastic brainstem and cerebellum. The cortical plate was either absent (6/13), with a 2-3 layered pattern (5/13) or less frequently thickened (2/13), often associated with neuroglial overmigration (4/13). All cases had voluminous germinal zones and ganglionic eminences. The second subtype was lissencephaly (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7), either classical (4/7) or associated with cerebellar hypoplasia (3/7) with corpus callosum agenesis (6/7). All foetuses with lissencephaly and cerebellar hypoplasia carried distinct TUBA1A mutations, while those with classical lissencephaly harbored recurrent mutations in TUBA1A (3 cases) or TUBB2B (1 case). The third group was polymicrogyria-like cortical dysplasia (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;6), consisting of asymmetric multifocal or generalized polymicrogyria with inconstant corpus callosum agenesis (4/6) and hypoplastic brainstem and cerebellum (3/6). Polymicrogyria was either unlayered or 4-layered with neuronal heterotopias (5/6) and occasional focal neuroglial overmigration (2/6). Three had TUBA1A mutations and 3 TUBB2B mutations. Foetal TUBA1A tubulinopathies most often consist in microlissencephaly or classical lissencephaly with corpus callosum agenesis, but polymicrogyria may also occur. Conversely, TUBB2B mutations are responsible for either polymicrogyria (4/6) or microlissencephaly (2/6)."
"Alzheimer's disease is caused by increased production or reduced clearance of amyloid-&#x3b2;, which results in the formation amyloid-&#x3b2; plaques and triggers a cascade of downstream events leading to progressive neurodegeneration. The earliest clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, i.e., memory loss, are however poorly understood from a molecular and cellular perspective. Here we used APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice to study the early pre-pathological effects of increased amyloid-&#x3b2; levels on hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory. Using an unbiased proteomics approach we show that the early increase in amyloid-&#x3b2; levels in APP/PS1 mice at three months of age coincides with a robust and significant upregulation of several protein components of the extracellular matrix in hippocampal synaptosome preparations. This increase in extracellular matrix levels occurred well before the onset of plaque formation and was paralleled by impairments in hippocampal long-term potentiation and contextual memory. Direct injection into the hippocampus of the extracellular matrix inactivating enzyme chondroitinase ABC restored both long-term potentiation and contextual memory performance. These findings indicate an important role for the extracellular matrix in causing early memory loss in Alzheimer's disease."
"Synaptic dysfunction occurs early in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and correlates with memory decline. There is emerging evidence that deregulation of Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular (Eph) receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) signaling contributes to the aberrant synaptic functions associated with neurodegeneration. The Eph receptor A4 is highly expressed in human adult hippocampal brain tissue and was previously linked to cognitive impairment in a transgenic mouse model for AD. Whether EphA4 levels are altered in AD brain remains elusive. Therefore we investigated the protein levels and localization of EphA4 in human hippocampus derived from AD (n = 29) as well as non-demented control cases (n = 19). The total EphA4 protein levels were not changed in AD patients compared to control cases. However, immunohistochemical localization of EphA4 revealed an altered distribution in AD compared to control hippocampus. EphA4 immunoreactivity was observed in plaque-like structures in AD cases. Double-labelling with phosphorylated tau and amyloid beta indicates that EphA4 co-localizes with neuritic plaques in AD. This altered distribution pattern was observed at early stages (Braak stage II) and correlates with the hallmarks of AD pathology suggesting a reduced availability of EphA4 that is likely to contribute to synaptic dysfunction that occurs early in AD."
"Polymicrogyria (PMG) is a complex cortical malformation which has so far defied any mechanistic or genetic explanation. Adopting a broad definition of an abnormally folded or festooned cerebral cortical neuronal ribbon, this review addresses the literature on PMG and the mechanisms of its development, as derived from the neuropathological study of many cases of human PMG, a large proportion in fetal life. This reveals the several processes which appear to be involved in the early stages of formation of polymicrogyric cortex. The most consistent feature of developing PMG is disruption of the brain surface with pial defects, over-migration of cells, thickening and reduplication of the pial collagen layers and increased leptomeningeal vascularity. Evidence from animal models is consistent with our observations and supports the notion that disturbance in the formation of the leptomeninges or loss of their normal signalling functions are potent contributors to cortical malformation. Other mechanisms which may lead to PMG include premature folding of the neuronal band, abnormal fusion of adjacent gyri and laminar necrosis of the developing cortex. The observation of PMG in association with other and better understood forms of brain malformation, such as cobblestone cortex, suggests mechanistic pathways for some forms of PMG. The role of altered physical properties of the thickened leptomeninges in exerting mechanical constraints on the developing cortex is also considered."
"Epilepsy and psychiatric comorbidities are frequently associated, but their common biological substrate is unknown. We have previously reported altered structural elements and neurotrophins (NTs) expression in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) patients with psychiatric comorbidities. NTs receptors can regulate neurotransmission and promote neuroplasticity, being important candidates in the regulation and manifestation of psychopatological states and seizure-related events. MTLE hippocampi of subjects without psychiatric history, MTLE&#x2009;+&#x2009;major depression, MTLE&#x2009;+&#x2009;interictal psychosis derived from epilepsy surgery, and control necropsies were investigated for p75(NTR), TrkB, TrkA, and TrkC immunohistochemistry. Increased expression of p75(NTR), decreased TrkA, unaltered TrkC, and complex alterations involving TrkB expression were seen in MTLE groups. Increased TrkB expression in patients without complete seizure remission and in those with secondarily generalized seizures was seen. Decreased p75(NTR) expression associated with interictal psychosis, and increased TrkB in those with psychosis or major depression was also reported, although their p75(NTR)/TrkB ratios were lower than in MTLE without psychiatric comorbidities. Our results provide evidence of alterations in expression of NTs receptors in the epileptogenic hippocampus that are differentially modulated in presence of psychiatric comorbidities. As already explored in animal models, even in chronic human MTLE increased TrkB expression, among other NT receptors alterations, may play a major role in seizure type, frequency and surgery outcome."
"Mutagenic loss of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene encoded protein merlin is known to provoke the hereditary neoplasia syndrome, Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). In addition to glial cell-derived tumors in the PNS and CNS, disease-related lesions also affect the skin and the eyes. Furthermore, 60% of NF2 patients suffer from peripheral nerve damage, clinically referred to as peripheral neuropathy. Strikingly, NF2-associated neuropathy often occurs in the absence of nerve damaging tumors, suggesting tumor-independent events. Recent findings indicate an important role of merlin in neuronal cell types concerning neuromorphogenesis, axon structure maintenance and communication between axons and Schwann cells. In this review, we compile clinical and experimental evidences for the underestimated role of the tumor suppressor merlin in the neuronal compartment."
"Angiogenesis, the formation of new vessels, is found in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) demyelinating lesions following Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) release and the production of several other angiogenic molecules. The increased energy demand of inflammatory cuffs and damaged neural cells explains the strong angiogenic response in plaques and surrounding white matter. An angiogenic response has also been documented in an experimental model of MS, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), where blood-brain barrier disruption and vascular remodelling appeared in a pre-symptomatic disease phase. In both MS and EAE, VEGF acts as a pro-inflammatory factor in the early phase but its reduced responsivity in the late phase can disrupt neuroregenerative attempts, since VEGF naturally enhances neuron resistance to injury and regulates neural progenitor proliferation, migration, differentiation and oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) survival and migration to demyelinated lesions. Angiogenesis, neurogenesis and oligodendroglia maturation are closely intertwined in the neurovascular niches of the subventricular zone, one of the preferential locations of inflammatory lesions in MS, and in all the other temporary vascular niches where the mutual fostering of angiogenesis and OPC maturation occurs. Angiogenesis, induced either by CNS inflammation or by hypoxic stimuli related to neurovascular uncoupling, appears to be ineffective in chronic MS due to a counterbalancing effect of vasoconstrictive mechanisms determined by the reduced axonal activity, astrocyte dysfunction, microglia secretion of free radical species and mitochondrial abnormalities. Thus, angiogenesis, that supplies several trophic factors, should be promoted in therapeutic neuroregeneration efforts to combat the progressive, degenerative phase of MS."
"Leptomeningeal dissemination (LMD), the metastatic spread of tumor cells via the cerebrospinal fluid to the brain and spinal cord, is an ominous prognostic sign for patients with the pediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma. The need to reduce the risk of LMD has driven the development of aggressive treatment regimens, which cause disabling neurotoxic side effects in long-term survivors. Transposon-mediated mutagenesis studies in mice have revealed numerous candidate metastasis genes. Understanding how these genes drive LMD will require functional assessment using in vivo and cell culture models of medulloblastoma. We analyzed two genes that were sites of frequent transposon insertion and highly expressed in human medulloblastomas: Arnt (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator) and Gdi2 (GDP dissociation inhibitor 2). Here we show that ectopic expression of Arnt and Gdi2 promoted LMD in mice bearing Sonic hedgehog (Shh)-induced medulloblastomas. We overexpressed Arnt and Gdi2 in a human medulloblastoma cell line (DAOY) and an immortalized, nontransformed cell line derived from mouse granule neuron precursors (SHH-NPD) and quantified migration, invasiveness, and anchorage-independent growth, cell traits that are associated with metastatic competence in carcinomas. In SHH-NPD cells. Arnt and Gdi2 stimulated all three traits. In DAOY cells, Arnt had the same effects, but Gdi2 stimulated invasiveness only. These results support a mechanism whereby Arnt and Gdi2 cause cells to detach from the primary tumor mass by increasing cell motility and invasiveness. By conferring to tumor cells the ability to proliferate without surface attachment, Arnt and Gdi2 favor the formation of stable colonies of cells capable of seeding the leptomeninges."
"Next to &#x3b1;-synuclein deposition, microglial activation is a prominent pathological feature in the substantia nigra (SN) of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Little is known, however, about the different phenotypes of microglia and how they change during disease progression, in the SN or in another brain region, like the hippocampus (HC), which is implicated in dementia and depression, important non-motor symptoms in PD. We studied phenotypes and activation of microglia in the SN and HC of established PD patients (Braak PD stage 4&#x2013;6), matched controls (Braak PD stage 0) and of incidental Lewy Body disease (iLBD) cases (Braak PD stage 1&#x2013;3) that are considered a prodromal state of PD. As recent experimental studies suggested that toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) mediates &#x3b1;-synuclein triggered microglial activation, we also studied whether TLR2 expression is indeed related to pathology in iLBD and PD patients. A clear &#x3b1;-synuclein pathology-related increase in amoeboid microglia was present in the HC and SN in PD. Also, morphologically primed/reactive microglial cells, and a profound increase in microglial TLR2 expression were apparent in iLBD, but not PD, cases, indicative of an early activational response to PD pathology. Moreover, TLR2 was differentially expressed between the SN and HC, consistent with a region-specific pattern of microglial activation. In conclusion, the regional changes in microglial phenotype and TLR2 expression in primed/reactive microglia in the SN and HC of iLBD cases indicate that TLR2 may play a prominent role in the microglial-mediated responses that could be important for PD progression."
"We explored the prevalence of syringomyelia in a series of 113 cases of fetal dysraphism and hindbrain crowding, of gestational age ranging from 17.5 to 34 weeks with the vast majority less than 26 weeks gestational age. We found syringomyelia in 13 cases of Chiari II malformations, 5 cases of Omphalocele/Exostrophy/Imperforate anus/Spinal abnormality (OEIS), 2 cases of Meckel Gruber syndrome and in a single pair of pyopagus conjoined twins. Secondary injury was not uncommon, with vernicomyelia in Chiari malformations, infarct like histology, or old hemorrhage in 8 cases of syringomyelia. Vernicomyelia did not occur in the absence of syrinx formation. The syringes extended from the sites of dysraphism, in ascending or descending patterns. The syringes were usually in a major proportion anatomically distinct from a dilated or denuded central canal and tended to be dorsal and paramedian or median. We suggest that fetal syringomyelia in Chiari II malformation and other dysraphic states is often established prior to midgestation, has contributions from the primary malformation as well as from secondary in utero injury and is anatomically and pathophysiologically distinct from post natal syringomyelia secondary to hindbrain crowding."
"A remarkable pathological difference between grey matter lesions (GML) and white matter lesions (WML) in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients is the paucity of infiltrating leukocytes in GML. To better understand these pathological differences, we hypothesize that the chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1 or CCL2), of importance for leukocyte migration, and its receptor CCR2 are more abundantly expressed in WML than in GML of MS patients. To this end, we analyzed CCL2 and CCR2 expression in the hippocampus, comprising WML and GML,of post-mortem MS patients, and of control subjects. CCL2 and CCR2 mRNA were significantly increased in demyelinated MS hippocampus. Semi-quantification of CCL2 and CCR2 immunoreactivity showed that CCL2 is present in astrocytes only in active WML. CCR2 is upregulated in monocytes/macrophages or amoeboid microglia in active WML, and in ramified microglia in active GML, although to a lesser extent. As a follow-up, we observed a significantly increased CCL2 production by WM-, but not GM-derived astrocytes upon stimulation with bz-ATP in vitro. Finally, upon CCL2 stimulation, GM-derived microglia significantly increased their proliferation rate. We conclude that within hippocampal lesions, CCL2 expression is mainly restricted to WML, whereas the receptor CCR2 is upregulated in both WML and GML. The relative absence of CCL2 in GML may explain the lack of infiltrating immune cells in this type of lesions. We propose that the divergent expression of CCL2 and CCR2 in WML and GML explains or contributes to the differences in WML and GML formation in MS."
"Mutations in ~100 genes cause muscle diseases with complex and often unexplained genotype/phenotype correlations. Next-generation sequencing studies identify a greater-than-expected number of genetic variations in the human genome. This suggests that existing clinical monogenic testing systematically miss very relevant information.We have created a core panel of genes that cause all known forms of nonsyndromic muscle disorders (MotorPlex). It comprises 93 loci, among which are the largest and most complex human genes, such as TTN, RYR1, NEB and DMD. MotorPlex captures at least 99.2% of 2,544 exons with a very accurate and uniform coverage. This quality is highlighted by the discovery of 20-30% more variations in comparison with whole exome sequencing. The coverage homogeneity has also made feasible to apply a cost-effective pooled sequencing strategy while maintaining optimal sensitivity and specificity.We studied 177 unresolved cases of myopathies for which the best candidate genes were previously excluded. We have identified known pathogenic variants in 52 patients and potential causative ones in further 56 patients. We have also discovered 23 patients showing multiple true disease-associated variants suggesting complex inheritance. Moreover, we frequently detected other nonsynonymous variants of unknown significance in the largest muscle genes. Cost-effective combinatorial pools of DNA samples were similarly accurate (97-99%). MotorPlex is a very robust platform that overcomes for power, costs, speed, sensitivity and specificity the gene-by-gene strategy. The applicability of pooling makes this tool affordable for the screening of genetic variability of muscle genes also in a larger population. We consider that our strategy can have much broader applications."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and currently, there is no effective treatment. The major neuropathological lesions in AD are accumulation of amyloid &#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) as amyloid plaques and congophilic amyloid angiopathy, as well as aggregated tau in the form of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). In addition, inflammation and microglia/macrophage function play an important role in AD pathogenesis. We have hypothesized that stimulation of the innate immune system via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists, such as type B CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), might be an effective way to ameliorate AD related pathology. We have previously shown in the Tg2576 AD model that CpG ODN can reduce amyloid deposition and prevent cognitive deficits. In the present study, we used the 3xTg-AD mice with both A&#x3b2; and tau related pathology. The mice were divided into 2 groups treated from 7 to 20 months of age, prior to onset of pathology and from 11 to 18 months of age, when pathology is already present. We demonstrated that immunomodulatory treatment with CpG ODN reduces both A&#x3b2; and tau pathologies, as well as levels of toxic oligomers, in the absence of any apparent inflammatory toxicity, in both animal groups. This pathology reduction is associated with a cognitive rescue in the 3xTg-AD mice. Our data indicate that modulation of microglial function via TLR9 stimulation is effective at ameliorating all the cardinal AD related pathologies in an AD mouse model suggesting such an approach would have a greater chance of achieving clinical efficacy."
"Mucolipidosis IV (MLIV) is caused by mutations in the gene MCOLN1. Patients with MLIV have severe neurologic deficits and very little is known about the brain pathology in this lysosomal disease. Using an accurate mouse model of mucolipidosis IV, we observed early behavioral deficits which were accompanied by activation of microglia and astrocytes. The glial activation that persisted during the course of disease was not accompanied by neuronal loss even at the late stage. In vivo [Ca(2+)]-imaging revealed no changes in resting [Ca(2+)] levels in Mcoln1(-/-) cortical neurons, implying their physiological health. Despite the absence of neuron loss, we observed alterations in synaptic plasticity, as indicated by elevated paired-pulse facilitation and enhanced long-term potentiation. Myelination deficits and severely dysmorphic corpus callosum were present early and resembled white matter pathology in mucolipidosis IV patients. These results indicate the early involvement of glia, and challenge the traditional view of mucolipidosis IV as an overtly neurodegenerative condition."
"High-grade Brainstem Glioma (BSG), also known as Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), is an incurable pediatric brain cancer. Increasing evidence supports the existence of regional differences in gliomagenesis such that BSG is considered a distinct disease from glioma of the cerebral cortex (CG). In an effort to elucidate unique characteristics of BSG, we conducted expression analysis of mouse PDGF-B-driven BSG and CG initiated in Nestin progenitor cells and identified a short list of expression changes specific to the brainstem gliomagenesis process, including abnormal upregulation of paired box 3 (Pax3). In the neonatal mouse brain, Pax3 expression marks a subset of brainstem progenitor cells, while it is absent from the cerebral cortex, mirroring its regional expression in glioma. Ectopic expression of Pax3 in normal brainstem progenitors in vitro shows that Pax3 inhibits apoptosis. Pax3-induced inhibition of apoptosis is p53-dependent, however, and in the absence of p53, Pax3 promotes proliferation of brainstem progenitors. In vivo, Pax3 enhances PDGF-B-driven gliomagenesis by shortening tumor latency and increasing tumor penetrance and grade, in a region-specific manner, while loss of Pax3 function extends survival of PDGF-B-driven;p53-deficient BSG-bearing mice by 33%. Importantly, Pax3 is regionally expressed in human glioma as well, with high PAX3 mRNA characterizing 40% of human BSG, revealing a subset of tumors that significantly associates with PDGFRA alterations, amplifications of cell cycle regulatory genes, and is exclusive of ACVR1 mutations. Collectively, these data suggest that regional Pax3 expression not only marks a novel subset of BSG but also contributes to PDGF-B-induced brainstem gliomagenesis."
"The amyloid hypothesis has driven drug development strategies for Alzheimer's disease for over 20 years. We review why accumulation of amyloid-beta (A&#x3b2;) oligomers is generally considered causal for synaptic loss and neurodegeneration in AD. We elaborate on and update arguments for and against the amyloid hypothesis with new data and interpretations, and consider why the amyloid hypothesis may be failing therapeutically. We note several unresolved issues in the field including the presence of A&#x3b2; deposition in cognitively normal individuals, the weak correlation between plaque load and cognition, questions regarding the biochemical nature, presence and role of A&#x3b2; oligomeric assemblies in vivo, the bias of pre-clinical AD models toward the amyloid hypothesis and the poorly explained pathological heterogeneity and comorbidities associated with AD. We also illustrate how extensive data cited in support of the amyloid hypothesis, including genetic links to disease, can be interpreted independently of a role for A&#x3b2; in AD. We conclude it is essential to expand our view of pathogenesis beyond A&#x3b2; and tau pathology and suggest several future directions for AD research, which we argue will be critical to understanding AD pathogenesis."
"p25&#x3b1;/tubulin polymerization promoting protein (TPPP) is an oligodendroglial protein that plays crucial roles including myelination, and the stabilization of microtubules. In multiple system atrophy (MSA), TPPP is suggested to relocate from the myelin sheath to the oligodendroglial cell body, before the formation of glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs), the pathologic hallmark of MSA. However, much is left unknown about the re-distribution of TPPP in MSA. We generated new antibodies against the N- and C-terminus of TPPP, and analyzed control and MSA brains, including the brain of a familial MSA patient carrying homozygous mutations in the coenzyme Q2 gene (COQ2). In control brain tissues, TPPP was localized not only in the cytoplasmic component of the oligodendroglia including perinuclear cytoplasm and peripheral processes in the white matter, but also in the nucleus of a fraction (62.4%) of oligodendroglial cells. Immunoelectron microscopic analysis showed TPPP in the nucleus and mitochondrial membrane of normal oligodendroglia, while western blot also supported its nuclear and mitochondrial existence. In MSA, the prevalence of nuclear TPPP was 48.6% in the oligodendroglia lacking GCIs, whereas it was further decreased to 19.6% in the oligodendroglia with phosphorylated &#x3b1;-synuclein (p&#x3b1;-syn)-positive GCIs, both showing a significant decrease compared to controls (62.4%). In contrast, TPPP accumulated in the perinuclear cytoplasm where mitochondrial membrane (TOM20 and cytochrome C) and fission (DRP1) proteins were often immunoreactive. We conclude that in MSA-oligodendroglia, TPPP is reduced, not only in the peripheral cytoplasm, but also in the nucleus and relocated to the perinuclear cytoplasm."
"Axial myopathy can be the underlying cause of rapidly progressive adult-onset scoliosis; however, the pathogenesis of this disorder remains poorly understood. Here we present a case of a 69-year old woman with a family history of scoliosis affecting both her mother and her son, who over 4 years developed rapidly progressive scoliosis. The patient had a history of stable scoliosis since adolescence that worsened significantly at age 65, leading to low back pain and radiculopathy. Paraspinal muscle biopsy showed morphologic evidence of a mitochondrial myopathy. Diagnostic deficiencies of electron transport chain enzymes were not detected using standard bioassays, but mitochondrial immunofluorescence demonstrated many muscle fibers totally or partially deficient for complexes I, III, IV-I, and IV-IV. Massively parallel sequencing of paraspinal muscle mtDNA detected multiple deletions as well as a 40.9% heteroplasmic novel m.12293G &gt; A (MT-TL2) variant, which changes a G:C pairing to an A:C mispairing in the anticodon stem of tRNA Leu(CUN). Interestingly, these mitochondrial abnormalities were not detected in the blood of either the patient or her son, suggesting that the patient's rapidly progressive late onset scoliosis was due to the acquired paraspinal mitochondrial myopathy; the cause of non-progressive scoliosis in the other two family members currently remains unexplained. Notably, this case illustrates that isolated mitochondrial myopathy can underlie rapidly-progressive adult-onset scoliosis and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the primary axial myopathy."
"Mutations in THAP1 result in dystonia type 6, with partial penetrance and variable phenotype. The goal of this study was to examine the nature and expression pattern of the protein product(s) of the Thap1 transcription factor (DYT6 gene) in mouse neurons, and to study the regional and developmental distribution, and subcellular localization of Thap1 protein. The goal was accomplished via overexpression and knock-down of Thap1 in the HEK293T cell line and in mouse striatal primary cultures and western blotting of embryonic Thap1-null tissue. The endogenous and transduced Thap1 isoforms were characterized using three different commercially available anti-Thap1 antibodies and validated by immunoprecipitation and DNA oligonucleotide affinity chromatography. We identified multiple, novel Thap1 species of apparent Mr 32&#xa0;kDa, 47&#xa0;kDa, and 50-52&#xa0;kDa in vitro and in vivo, and verified the previously identified species at 29-30&#xa0;kDa in neurons. The Thap1 species at the 50&#xa0;kDa size range was exclusively detected in murine brain and testes and were located in the nuclear compartment. Thus, in addition to the predicted 25&#xa0;kDa apparent Mr, we identified Thap1 species with greater apparent Mr that we speculate may be a result of posttranslational modifications. The neural localization of the 50&#xa0;kDa species and its nuclear compartmentalization suggests that these may be key Thap1 species controlling neuronal gene transcription. Dysfunction of the neuronal 50&#xa0;kDa species may therefore be implicated in the pathogenesis of DYT6."
"A 28-month female with a clinical diagnosis of neurocutaneous melanosis and numerous intracranial abnormalities (including a right choroid plexus tumor and left hemimegalencephaly) presented with a rapidly expanding tumor in the left occipital cerebrum. Microscopic examination of the resected specimen revealed a myxoid mesenchymal neoplasm consisting of fusiform cells that were immunoreactive for vimentin, CD34, and P53 but no melanocyte markers. Focused amplicon deep sequencing on DNA extracted from the brain tumor and a cutaneous nevus revealed a heterozygous (c.37G&gt;C; p.G13R) substitution in the NRAS gene. DNA sequencing of ""normal"" skin and buccal swab showed the identical NRAS change albeit at lower allelic frequency. Her parents did not harbor the NRAS mutation. The skin lesion, but not the brain tumor, had a BRAF mutation (c.1397G&gt;T; p.G466V). A germline single nucleotide polymorphism in MET was found in the child and her father (c.3209C&gt;T; p.T1010I). The findings suggest NRAS mosaicism that occurred sometime after conception and imply an oncogenic role of the activating NRAS mutation in both the brain and skin lesions in this child."
"This paper summarizes pathological changes that affect microglial cells in the human brain during aging and in aging-related neurodegenerative diseases, primarily Alzheimer's disease (AD). It also provides examples of microglial changes that have been observed in laboratory animals during aging and in some experimentally induced lesions and disease models. Dissimilarities and similarities between humans and rodents are discussed in an attempt to generate a current understanding of microglial pathology and its significance during aging and in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer dementia (AD). The identification of dystrophic (senescent) microglia has created an ostensible conflict with prior work claiming a role for activated microglia and neuroinflammation during normal aging and in AD, and this has raised a basic question: does the brain's immune system become hyperactive (inflamed) or does it become weakened (senescent) in elderly and demented people, and what is the impact on neuronal function and cognition? Here we strive to reconcile these seemingly contradictory notions by arguing that both low-grade neuroinflammation and microglial senescence are the result of aging-associated free radical injury. Both processes are damaging for microglia as they synergistically exhaust this essential cell population to the point where the brain's immune system is effete and unable to support neuronal function."
"The accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) propagates with characteristic spatiotemporal patterns which follow brain network connections, implying trans-synaptic transmission of tauopathy. Since misfolded tau has been shown to transmit across synapses in AD animal models, we hypothesized that synapses in AD patients may contain misfolded tau. By immunofluorescence imaging of bipartite synapses from AD subjects, we detected tau protein in 38.4% of presynaptic and 50.9% of postsynaptic terminals. The pre/post distribution for hyperphosphorylated tau was 26.9%/30.7%, and for misfolded tau 18.3%/19.3%. In the temporal cortex, microscopic aggregates of tau, containing ultra-stable oligomers, were estimated to accumulate within trillions of synapses, outnumbering macroscopic tau aggregates such as tangles by 10000 fold. Non-demented elderly also showed considerable synaptic tau hyperphosphorylation and some misfolding, implicating the synapse as one of the first subcellular compartments affected by tauopathy. Misfolding of tau protein appeared to occur in situ inside synaptic terminals, without mislocalizing or mistrafficking. Misfolded tau at synapses may represent early signs of neuronal degeneration, mediators of synaptotoxicity, and anatomical substrates for transmitting tauopathy, but its actual role in these processes remain to be elucidated."
"Hypersynchronicity of neuronal brain circuits is a feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mouse models of AD expressing mutated forms of the amyloid-&#x3b2; precursor protein (APP), a central protein involved in AD pathology, show cortical hypersynchronicity. We studied hippocampal circuitry in APP23 transgenic mice using telemetric electroencephalography (EEG), at the age of onset of memory deficits. APP23 mice display spontaneous hypersynchronicity in the hippocampus including epileptiform spike trains. Furthermore, spectral contributions of hippocampal theta and gamma oscillations are compromised in APP23 mice, compared to non-transgenic controls. Using cross-frequency coupling analysis, we show that hippocampal gamma amplitude modulation by theta phase is markedly impaired in APP23 mice. Hippocampal hypersynchronicity and waveforms are differentially modulated by injection of riluzole and the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor inhibitor MK801, suggesting specific involvement of voltage-gated sodium channels and NMDA receptors in hypersynchronicity thresholds in APP23 mice. Furthermore, APP23 mice show marked activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in hippocampus, and injection of MK801 but not riluzole reduces activation of p38 in the hippocampus. A p38 inhibitor induces hypersynchronicity in APP23 mice to a similar extent as MK801, thus supporting suppression of hypersynchronicity involves NMDA receptors-mediated p38 activity. In summary, we characterize components of hippocampal hypersynchronicity, waveform patterns and cross-frequency coupling in the APP23 mouse model by pharmacological modulation, furthering the understanding of epileptiform brain activity in AD."
"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rapidly-progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia and autonomic failure. A pathological hallmark of MSA is the presence of &#x3b1;-synuclein deposits in oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing support cells of the brain. Brain pathology and in vitro studies indicate that myelin instability may be an early event in the pathogenesis of MSA. Lipid is a major constituent (78% w/w) of myelin and has been implicated in myelin dysfunction in MSA. However, changes, if any, in lipid level/distribution in MSA brain are unknown. Here, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of MSA myelin. We quantitatively measured three groups of lipids, sphingomyelin, sulfatide and galactosylceramide, which are all important in myelin integrity and function, in affected (under the motor cortex) and unaffected (under the visual cortex) white matter regions. For all three groups of lipids, most of the species were severely decreased (40-69%) in affected but not unaffected MSA white matter. An analysis of the distribution of lipid species showed no significant shift in fatty acid chain length/content with MSA. The decrease in lipid levels was concomitant with increased &#x3b1;-synuclein expression. These data indicate that the absolute levels, and not distribution, of myelin lipids are altered in MSA, and provide evidence for myelin lipid dysfunction in MSA pathology. We propose that dysregulation of myelin lipids in the course of MSA pathogenesis may trigger myelin instability."
"Genetic polymorphisms in Solute carrier family 1 (glial high affinity glutamate transporter), member 2 (SLC1A2) have been linked with essential tremor. SLC1A2 encodes excitatory amino acid transporter type 2 (EAAT2), which clears glutamate from the synaptic cleft. One postulated mechanism for essential tremor is the over-excitation of glutamatergic olivo-cerebellar climbing fibers, leading to excitotoxic death of Purkinje cells. Other glutamatergic excitatory signals are transmitted to Purkinje cells via parallel fibers of cerebellar granule neurons. Therefore, the expression level of glutamate transporters could be important in essential tremor pathogenesis. Using Western blotting, we compared the expression levels of the two main glutamate transporters in the cerebellar cortex, EAAT1 and EAAT2, in postmortem tissue from 16 essential tremor cases and 13 age-matched controls. We also studied the localization of EAAT1 and EAAT2 using immunohistochemistry in 10 essential tremor cases and 12 controls. EAAT1 protein levels were similar in cases and controls (1.12 &#xb1; 0.83 vs. 1.01 &#xb1; 0.69, p =0.71) whereas EAAT2 protein levels in essential tremor cases were only 1/3 of that in controls (0.35 &#xb1; 0.23 vs. 1.00 &#xb1; 0.62, p &lt; 0.01). Interestingly, EAAT2, but not EAAT1, was expressed in astrocytic processes surrounding the Purkinje cell axon initial segment, a region of previously observed pathological changes in essential tremor. Our main finding, a significant reduction in cerebellar cortical EAAT2 protein levels in essential tremor, suggests that Purkinje cells in essential tremor might be more vulnerable to excitotoxic damage than those of controls."
"Clinical outcome of children with malignant glioma remains dismal. Here, we examined the role of over-expressed BMI1, a regulator of stem cell self-renewal, in sustaining tumor formation in pediatric glioma stem cells. Our investigation revealed BMI1 over-expression in 29 of 54 (53.7%) pediatric gliomas, 8 of 8 (100%) patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) mouse models, and in both CD133+ and CD133- glioma cells. We demonstrated that lentiviral-shRNA mediated silencing of suppressed cell proliferation in vitro in cells derived from 3 independent PDOX models and eliminated tumor-forming capacity of CD133+ and CD133- cells derived from 2 PDOX models in mouse brains. Gene expression profiling showed that most of the molecular targets of BMI1 ablation in CD133+ cells were different from that in CD133- cells. Importantly, we found that silencing BMI1 in CD133+ cells derived from 3 PDOX models did not affect most of the known genes previously associated with the activated BMI1, but modulated a novel set of core genes, including RPS6KA2, ALDH3A2, FMFB, DTL, API5, EIF4G2, KIF5c, LOC650152, C20ORF121, LOC203547, LOC653308, and LOC642489, to mediate the elimination of tumor formation. In summary, we identified the over-expressed BMI1 as a promising therapeutic target for glioma stem cells, and suggest that the signaling pathways associated with activated BMI1 in promoting tumor growth may be different from those induced by silencing BMI1 in blocking tumor formation. These findings highlighted the importance of careful re-analysis of the affected genes following the inhibition of abnormally activated oncogenic pathways to identify determinants that can potentially predict therapeutic efficacy."
"Pretangles are defined under the light microscope as diffuse and granular tau immunoreactivity in neurons in tissue from patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) or corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and are considered to be a premature stage before neurofibrillary tangle formation. However, the ultrastructure of pretangles remains to be described. To clarify the similarities and differences between pretangles from patients with AD and CBD (AD-pretangles and CBD-pretangles, respectively), we examined cortical pretangles in tissue from patients with each of diseases. For direct light and electron microscopic (LM/EM) correlation of the pretangles, we used quantum dot nanocrystals (QDs) with dual fluorescent and electron-dense properties. We first identified tau-labeled pretangles on fluorescence LM and subsequently examined the same neurons on EM. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) color mapping identified selenium (Se) and cadmium (Cd) as elementary components of QDs and highlighted each QD particle clearly against gray-scale EM images. With these methods, we were successful for the first time in demonstrating accurately that LM-defined pretangles are tau-positive straight filaments sparsely distributed throughout neuronal cytoplasm and neurites in both AD and CBD at the EM level. Notably, AD-pretangles showed a strong tendency to form fibrillary tangles even at an early stage, whereas pretangles or Pick-like inclusions in tissue from patients with CBD did not even at an advanced stage. In conclusion, AD-pretangles and CBD-pretangles showed essential differences at the EM level."
"Regulatory T cells are crucial in controlling various functions of effector T cells during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. While regulatory T cells are reported to exert their immunomodulatory effects in the peripheral immune organs, their role within the central nervous system (CNS) during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is unclear. Here, by combining a selectively timed regulatory T cells depletion with 2-photon microscopy, we report that regulatory T cells exercise their dynamic control over effector T cells in the CNS. Acute depletion of regulatory T cells exacerbated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis severity which was accompanied by increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production and proliferation of effector T cells. Intravital microscopy revealed that, in the absence of regulatory T cells, the velocity of effector T cells was decreased with simultaneous increase in the proportion of stationary phase cells in the CNS. Based on these data, we conclude that regulatory T cells mediate recovery from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by controlling cytokine production, proliferation and motility of effector T cells in the CNS."
"Kallikrein-6 and calpain-1 are amongst a small group of proteases that degrade &#x3b1;-synuclein. We have explored the possibility that reduction in the level or activity of these enzymes contributes to the accumulation of &#x3b1;-synuclein in Lewy body diseases. We measured calpain-1 activity by fluorogenic activity assay, kallikrein-6 level by sandwich ELISA, and levels of &#x3b1;-synuclein and &#x3b1;-synuclein phosphorylated at serine 129 (&#x3b1;-synuclein-P129), in post-mortem brain tissue in pure dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n=12), Alzheimer's disease (AD, n=20) and age-matched controls (n=19). Calpain-1 activity was significantly reduced in DLB within the cingulate and parahippocampal cortex, regions with highest &#x3b1;-synuclein and &#x3b1;-synuclein-P129 load, and correlated inversely with the levels of &#x3b1;-synuclein and &#x3b1;-synuclein-P129. Calpain-1 was unaltered in the thalamus and frontal cortex, regions with less &#x3b1;-synuclein pathology. Kallikrein-6 level was reduced in the cingulate cortex in the DLB cohort, and correlated inversely with &#x3b1;-synuclein and &#x3b1;-synuclein-P129. Kallikrein-6 was also reduced in DLB in the thalamus but not in relation to &#x3b1;-synuclein or &#x3b1;-synuclein-P129 load and was unaltered in the frontal and parahippocampal cortex. In SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing wild-type &#x3b1;-synuclein there was partial co-localisation of kallikrein-6 and calpain-1 with &#x3b1;-synuclein, and siRNA-mediated knock-down of kallikrein-6 and calpain-1 increased the amount of &#x3b1;-synuclein in cell lysates. Our results indicate that reductions in kallikrein-6 and calpain-1 may contribute to the accumulation of &#x3b1;-synuclein in DLB."
"Hemangioblastomas consist of 10-20% neoplastic ""stromal"" cells within a vascular tumor cell mass of reactive pericytes, endothelium and lymphocytes. Familial cases of central nervous system hemangioblastoma uniformly result from mutations in the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. In contrast, inactivation of VHL has been previously observed in only a minority of sporadic hemangioblastomas, suggesting an alternative genetic etiology. We performed deep-coverage DNA sequencing on 32 sporadic hemangioblastomas (whole exome discovery cohort n = 10, validation n = 22), followed by analysis of clonality, copy number alteration, and somatic mutation. We identified somatic mutation, loss of heterozygosity and/or deletion of VHL in 8 of 10 discovery cohort tumors. VHL inactivating events were ultimately detected in 78% (25/32) of cases. No other gene was significantly mutated. Overall, deep-coverage sequence analysis techniques uncovered VHL alterations within the neoplastic fraction of these tumors at higher frequencies than previously reported. Our findings support the central role of VHL inactivation in the molecular pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic hemangioblastomas."
"Chronic demyelination is a pathological hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS). Only a minority of MS lesions remyelinates completely. Enhancing remyelination is, therefore, a major aim of future MS therapies. Here we took a novel approach to identify factors that may inhibit or support endogenous remyelination in MS. We dissected remyelinated, demyelinated active, and demyelinated inactive white matter MS lesions, and compared transcript levels of myelination and inflammation-related genes using quantitative PCR on customized TaqMan Low Density Arrays. In remyelinated lesions, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 1 was the most abundant of all analyzed myelination-regulating factors, showed a trend towards higher expression as compared to demyelinated lesions and was significantly higher than in control white matter. Two MS tissue blocks comprised lesions with adjacent de- and remyelinated areas and FGF1 expression was higher in the remyelinated rim compared to the demyelinated lesion core. In functional experiments, FGF1 accelerated developmental myelination in dissociated mixed cultures and promoted remyelination in slice cultures, whereas it decelerated differentiation of purified primary oligodendrocytes, suggesting that promotion of remyelination by FGF1 is based on an indirect mechanism. The analysis of human astrocyte responses to FGF1 by genome wide expression profiling showed that FGF1 induced the expression of the chemokine CXCL8 and leukemia inhibitory factor, two factors implicated in recruitment of oligodendrocytes and promotion of remyelination. Together, this study presents a transcript profiling of remyelinated MS lesions and identified FGF1 as a promoter of remyelination. Modulation of FGF family members might improve myelin repair in MS."
"Recent evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by inflammatory cells drive axonal degeneration in active multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria are endowed with a variety of antioxidant enzymes, including peroxiredoxin-3 and thioredoxin-2, which are involved in limiting ROS-induced damage. In this study, we explored the distribution and role of the mitochondrial antioxidants peroxiredoxin-3 and thioredoxin-2 as well as their regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator1-alpha (PGC-1&#x3b1;) in MS pathogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis of a large cohort of MS patients revealed a striking upregulation of PGC-1&#x3b1; and downstream mitochondrial antioxidants in active demyelinating MS lesions. Enhanced expression was predominantly observed in reactive astrocytes. To elucidate the functional role of astrocytic PGC-1&#x3b1; in MS pathology, we generated human primary astrocytes that genetically overexpressed PGC-1&#x3b1;. Upon an oxidative insult, these cells were shown to produce less ROS and were found to be more resistant to ROS-induced cell death compared to control cells. Intriguingly, also neuronal cells co-cultured with PGC-1&#x3b1;-overexpressing astrocytes were protected against an exogenous oxidative attack compared to neuronal cells co-cultured with control astrocytes. Finally, enhanced astrocytic PGC-1&#x3b1; levels markedly reduced the production and secretion of the pro-inflammatory mediators interleukin-6 and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2. Our findings suggest that increased astrocytic PGC-1&#x3b1; in active MS lesions might initially function as an endogenous protective mechanism to dampen oxidative damage and inflammation thereby reducing neurodegeneration. Activation of PGC-1&#x3b1; therefore represents a promising therapeutic strategy to improve mitochondrial function and repress inflammation."
"TP53 mutations confer subgroup specific poor survival for children with medulloblastoma. We hypothesized that WNT activation which is associated with improved survival for such children abrogates TP53 related radioresistance and can be used to sensitize TP53 mutant tumors for radiation. We examined the subgroup-specific role of TP53 mutations in a cohort of 314 patients treated with radiation. TP53 wild-type or mutant human medulloblastoma cell-lines and normal neural stem cells were used to test radioresistance of TP53 mutations and the radiosensitizing effect of WNT activation on tumors and the developing brain. Children with WNT/TP53 mutant medulloblastoma had higher 5-year survival than those with SHH/TP53 mutant tumours (100% and 36.6%&#xb1;8.7%, respectively (p&lt;0.001)). Introduction of TP53 mutation into medulloblastoma cells induced radioresistance (survival fractions at 2Gy (SF2) of 89%&#xb1;2% vs. 57.4%&#xb1;1.8% (p&lt;0.01)). In contrast, &#x3b2;-catenin mutation sensitized TP53 mutant cells to radiation (p&lt;0.05). Lithium, an activator of the WNT pathway, sensitized TP53 mutant medulloblastoma to radiation (SF2 of 43.5%&#xb1;1.5% in lithium treated cells vs. 56.6&#xb1;3% (p&lt;0.01)) accompanied by increased number of &#x3b3;H2AX foci. Normal neural stem cells were protected from lithium induced radiation damage (SF2 of 33%&#xb1;8% for lithium treated cells vs. 27%&#xb1;3% for untreated controls (p=0.05). Poor survival of patients with TP53 mutant medulloblastoma may be related to radiation resistance. Since constitutive activation of the WNT pathway by lithium sensitizes TP53 mutant medulloblastoma cells and protect normal neural stem cells from radiation, this oral drug may represent an attractive novel therapy for high-risk medulloblastomas."
"Long before synaptic loss occurs in Alzheimer's disease significant harbingers of disease may be detected at the functional level. Here we examined if synaptic long-term potentiation is selectively disrupted prior to extracellular deposition of A&#xdf; in a very complete model of Alzheimer's disease amyloidosis, the McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic rat. Longitudinal studies in freely behaving animals revealed an age-dependent, relatively rapid-onset and persistent inhibition of long-term potentiation without a change in baseline synaptic transmission in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. Thus the ability of a standard 200 Hz conditioning protocol to induce significant NMDA receptor-dependent short- and long-term potentiation was lost at about 3.5 months of age and this deficit persisted for at least another 2-3 months, when plaques start to appear. Consistent with in vitro evidence for a causal role of a selective reduction in NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents, the deficit in synaptic plasticity in vivo was associated with a reduction in the synaptic burst response to the conditioning stimulation and was overcome using stronger 400 Hz stimulation. Moreover, intracerebroventricular treatment for 3 days with an N-terminally directed monoclonal anti- human A&#xdf; antibody, McSA1, transiently reversed the impairment of synaptic plasticity. Similar brief treatment with the BACE1 inhibitor LY2886721 or the &#x3b3;-secretase inhibitor MRK-560 was found to have a comparable short-lived ameliorative effect when tracked in individual rats. These findings provide strong evidence that endogenously generated human A&#xdf; selectively disrupts the induction of long-term potentiation in a manner that enables potential therapeutic options to be assessed longitudinally at the pre-plaque stage of Alzheimer's disease amyloidosis."
"Parkinson's disease (PD) is not only characterized by motor disturbances but also, by cognitive, sensory, psychiatric and autonomic dysfunction. It has been proposed that some of these symptoms might be related to the widespread pathology of &#x3b1;-synuclein (&#x3b1;-syn) aggregation in different nuclei of the central and peripheral nervous system. However, the pathogenic formation of &#x3b1;-syn aggregates in different brain areas of PD patients is poorly understood. Most experimental models of PD are valuable to assess specific aspects of its pathogenesis, such as toxin-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. However, new models are required that reflect the widespread and progressive formation of &#x3b1;-syn aggregates in different brain areas. Such &#x3b1;-syn aggregation is induced in only a few animal models, for example perikaryon inclusions are found in rats administered rotenone, aggregates with a neuritic morphology develop in mice overexpressing either mutated or wild-type &#x3b1;-syn, and in Smad3 deficient mice, aggregates form extensively in the perikaryon and neurites of specific brain nuclei. In this review we focus on &#x3b1;-syn aggregation in the human disorder, its genetics and the availability of experimental models. Indeed, evidences show that dopamine (DA) metabolism may be related to &#x3b1;-syn and its conformational plasticity, suggesting an interesting link between the two pathological hallmarks of PD: dopaminergic neurodegeneration and Lewy body (LB) formation."
"Huntington's disease (HD) disturbs glucose metabolism in the brain by poorly understood mechanisms. HD neurons have defective glucose uptake, which is attenuated upon enhancing rab11 activity. Rab11 regulates numerous receptors and transporters trafficking onto cell surfaces; its diminished activity in HD cells affects the recycling of transferrin receptor and neuronal glutamate/cysteine transporter EAAC1. Glucose transporter 3 (Glut3) handles most glucose uptake in neurons. Here we investigated rab11 involvement in Glut3 trafficking. Glut3 was localized to rab11 positive puncta in primary neurons and immortalized striatal cells by immunofluorescence labeling and detected in rab11-enriched endosomes immuno-isolated from mouse brain by Western blot. Expression of dominant active and negative rab11 mutants in clonal striatal cells altered the levels of cell surface Glut3 suggesting a regulation by rab11. About 4% of total Glut3 occurred at the cell surface of primary WT neurons. HD(140Q/140Q) neurons had significantly less cell surface Glut3 than did WT neurons. Western blot analysis revealed comparable levels of Glut3 in the striatum and cortex of WT and HD(140Q/140Q) mice. However, brain slices immunolabeled with an antibody recognizing an extracellular epitope to Glut3 showed reduced surface expression of Glut3 in the striatum and cortex of HD(140Q/140Q) mice compared to that of WT mice. Surface labeling of GABA&#x3b1;1 receptor, which is not dependent on rab11, was not different between WT and HD(140Q/140Q) mouse brain slices. These data define Glut3 to be a rab11-dependent trafficking cargo and suggest that impaired Glut3 trafficking arising from rab11 dysfunction underlies the glucose hypometabolism observed in HD."
"The R132H mutation of cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1) is present in the majority of low grade gliomas.Immunotherapy in these tumors has an interesting, still unexploited, therapeutic potential, as they are less immunosuppressive than glioblastomas. Using site-directed mutagenesis we introduced the R132H mutation into the murine glioma cell line GL261,creating mIDH1-GL261. Presence of the mutation was confirmed by immunoblotting and production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), demonstrated by mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) performed on cell supernatant. In vitro mIDH1-GL261 had different morphology but similar growth rate than parental GL261 (p-GL261). After intracranial injection, MRI suggested that the initial growth rate was slower in mIDH1-GL261 than p-GL261 gliomas but overall survival was similar. mIDH1-GL261 gliomas showed evidence of R132H expression and of intratumoral 2HG production (evaluated by MRS and LC-MS/MS). Immunizations were performed nine days after intracranial implantation of mIDH1- or p-GL261 cells by three subcutaneous injections of five different peptides encompassing the IDH1 mutation site, all emulsified with Montanide ISA-51, in association with GM-CSF. Control mice were injected with four ovalbumin peptides or vehicle. Mice with mIDH1-GL261 but not p-GL261 gliomas treated with mIDH1 peptides survived longer than controls; 25% of them were cured. Immunized mice showed higher amounts of peripheral CD8+ T cells, higher production of IFN-&#x3b3;, and evidence of anti-mIDH1 antibodies.Immunizations led to intratumoral up-regulation of IFN-&#x3b3;, granzyme-b and perforin-1 and down-regulation of TGF-&#x3b2;2 and IL-10. These results support the translational potential of immunotherapeutic targeting of gliomas carrying IDH1 mutations."
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset disease characterized by the selective degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord progressively leading to paralysis and death. Current diagnosis of ALS is based on clinical assessment of related symptoms. The clinical manifestations observed in ALS appear relatively late in the disease course after degeneration of a significant number of motor neurons. As a result, the identification and development of disease-modifying therapies is difficult. Therefore, novel strategies for early diagnosis of neurodegeneration, to monitor disease progression and to assess response to existing and future treatments are urgently needed. Factually, many neurological disorders, including ALS, are accompanied by skin changes that often precede the onset of neurological symptoms. Aiming to generate an innovative human-based model to facilitate the identification of predictive biomarkers associated with the disease, we developed a unique ALS tissue-engineered skin model (ALS-TES) derived from patient's own cells. The ALS-TES presents a number of striking features including altered epidermal differentiation, abnormal dermo-epidermal junction, delamination, keratinocyte infiltration, collagen disorganization and cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions. Remarkably, these abnormal skin defects, uniquely seen in the ALS-derived skins, were detected in pre-symtomatic C9orf72-linked ALS patients carrying the GGGGCC DNA repeat expansion. Consequently, our ALS skin model could represent a renewable source of human tissue, quickly and easily accessible to better understand the physiophatological mechanisms underlying this disease, to facilitate the identification of disease-specific biomarkers, and to develop innovative tools for early diagnosis and disease monitoring."
"The Lysosomal Associated Membrane Protein type-2 (LAMP-2) is an abundant lysosomal membrane protein with an important role in immunity, macroautophagy (MA) and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Mutations within the Lamp2 gene cause Danon disease, an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder characterized by (cardio)myopathy and intellectual dysfunction. The pathological hallmark of this disease is an accumulation of glycogen and autophagic vacuoles in cardiac and skeletal muscle that, along with the myopathy, is also present in LAMP-2-deficient mice. Intellectual dysfunction observed in the human disease suggests a pivotal role of LAMP-2 within brain. LAMP-2A, one specific LAMP-2 isoform, was proposed to be important for the lysosomal degradation of selective proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's and Parkinson's disease. To elucidate the neuronal function of LAMP-2 we analyzed knockout mice for neuropathological changes, MA and steady-state levels of CMA substrates. The absence of LAMP-2 in murine brain led to inflammation and abnormal behavior, including motor deficits and impaired learning. The latter abnormality points to hippocampal dysfunction caused by altered lysosomal activity, distinct accumulation of p62-positive aggregates, autophagic vacuoles and lipid storage within hippocampal neurons and their presynaptic terminals. The absence of LAMP-2 did not apparently affect MA or steady-state levels of selected CMA substrates in brain or neuroblastoma cells under physiological and prolonged starvation conditions. Our data contribute to the understanding of intellectual dysfunction observed in Danon disease patients and highlight the role of LAMP-2 within the central nervous system, particularly the hippocampus."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disorder where the distribution of pathology throughout the brain is not random but follows a predictive pattern used for pathological staging. While the involvement of defined functional systems is fairly well established for more advanced stages, the initial sites of degeneration are still ill defined. The prevailing concept suggests an origin within the transentorhinal and entorhinal cortex (EC) from where pathology spreads to other areas. Still, this concept has been challenged recently suggesting a potential origin of degeneration in nonthalamic subcortical nuclei giving rise to cortical innervation such as locus coeruleus (LC) and nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM). To contribute to the identification of the early site of degeneration, here, we address the question whether cortical or subcortical degeneration occurs more early and develops more quickly during progression of AD. To this end, we stereologically assessed neurone counts in the NbM, LC and EC layer-II in the same AD patients ranging from preclinical stages to severe dementia. In all three areas, neurone loss becomes detectable already at preclinical stages and is clearly manifest at prodromal AD/MCI. At more advanced AD, cell loss is most pronounced in the NbM &gt; LC &gt; layer-II EC. During early AD, however, the extent of cell loss is fairly balanced between all three areas without clear indications for a preference of one area. We can thus not rule out that there is more than one way of spreading from its site of origin or that degeneration even occurs independently at several sites in parallel."
"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is one of the leading causes of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. A high-ranking candidate to become a diagnostic marker for a major pathological subtype of FTLD is the transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43). The main objective is to elucidate which antibodies are specific for pathological TDP-43, with special interest in its modified isoforms. Indeed, TDP-43 has been shown to be hyperphosphorylated and truncated in disease. A secondary objective is to review existing immunoassays that quantify TDP-43 in biofluids. A systematic review of literature was performed by searching PubMed and Web of Science using predefined keywords. Of considered research papers the methods section was reviewed to select publications that enabled us to answer our learning objective. After quality assessment, antibody characteristics and related outcomes were extracted. We identified a series of well-characterized antibodies based on a scoring system that assessed the ability of each antibody to detect TDP-43 pathology. A selection of 29 unique antibodies was made comprising 10 high-ranking antibodies which were reported multiple times to detect TDP-43 pathology in both immunostaining and immunoblotting experiments and 19 additional antibodies which detected TDP-43 pathology but were only scored once. This systematic review provides an overview of antibodies that are reported to detect pathological TDP-43. These antibodies can be used in future studies of TDP-43 proteinopathies. Additionally, selected antibodies hold the potential to be used in the development of novel immunoassays for the quantification of TDP-43 in biofluids, as a possible biomarker for FTLD-TDP."
"Functional and morphological alterations of the intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) have been consistently reported in digestive disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. There is mounting evidence that Parkinson's disease (PD) is not only a brain disease but also a digestive disorder. Gastrointestinal involvement is a frequent and early event in the course of PD, and it may be critically involved in the early development of the disease. We therefore undertook the present survey to investigate whether changes in the IEB function and/or morphology occur in PD. Colonic biopsies were performed in 31 PD patients and 11 age-matched healthy controls. The para- and transcellular permeability were evaluated by measuring sulfonic acid and horseradish peroxidase flux respectively, in colonic biopsies mounted in Ussing chambers. The expression and localization of the two tight junctions proteins ZO-1 and occludin were analyzed by Western blot and immunofluorescence, respectively. The para- and transcellular permeability were not different between PD patients and controls. The expression of occludin, but not ZO-1, was significantly lower in colonic samples from PD patients as compared to controls and the cellular distribution of both proteins was altered in colonic mucosal specimens from PD patients. Our findings provide evidence that the IEB is morphologically altered in PD and further reinforce the potential role of the gastrointestinal tract in the initiation and/or the progression of the disease."
"NHERF1/EBP50, an adaptor protein required for epithelial morphogenesis, has been implicated in the progression of various human malignancies. NHERF1-deficient mice have intestinal brush border structural defects and we report here that they also have disorganized ependymal cilia with development of non-obstructive hydrocephalus. Examination of mouse and human brain tissues revealed highest NHERF1 expression at the apical plasma membrane of ependymal cells. In ependymal tumors, NHERF1 expression was retained in polarized membrane structures, such as microlumens, rosettes and canals, where it co-localized with some of its ligands, such as moesin and PTEN. Analysis of a comprehensive panel of 113 tumors showed robust NHERF1 labeling of microlumens in 100% of ependymomas, subependymomas, and pediatric anaplastic ependymomas, and in 67% of adult anaplastic ependymomas. NHERF1 staining was present in 35% of ependymoma cases that lacked reactivity for EMA, the routine immunohistochemical marker used for ependymoma diagnosis. NHERF1 labeling of microlumens was either absent or rarely seen in other types of brain tumors analyzed, denoting NHERF1 as a reliable diagnostic marker of ependymal tumors. Anaplastic foci and a subset of adult anaplastic ependymomas showed complete absence of NHERF1-labeled polarity structures, consistent with a loss of differentiation in these aggressive tumors. These data highlight a role for NHERF1 in ependymal morphogenesis with direct application to the diagnosis of ependymal tumors."
"Transthyretin/TTR gene mutations usually cause systemic amyloidotic diseases. Few TTR variants preferentially affect the central nervous system, manifesting as oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis. Patients with TTR meningovascular amyloidosis often show dementia, however the neuropathologic features of dementia in these cases have not been elucidated. We report the neuropathologic findings from a brain autopsy of a 72-year-old man with the rare Tyr69His (Y69H) TTR gene variant, dementia and ataxia. Severe amyloid deposits were observed in the leptomeninges and in a subpial and subependymal distribution. Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that the amyloid deposits were comprised of over 80&#xa0;% of the variant TTR. TTR was undetectable by mass spectrometry in the neocortex subjacent to the subpial amyloid deposits. Subpial TTR amyloid deposits were associated with brisk superficial reactive gliosis and siderosis in the neocortex and cerebellar cortex. Subependymal TTR amyloid deposits were associated with subjacent myelin pallor in the hippocampal outflow tract structures including the alveus, fimbria and fornix. Phospho-tau immunostains demonstrated transentorhinal-stage neurofibrillary degeneration (Braak stage II) which, in the absence of neocortical amyloid-beta and neuritic plaques, was indicative of primary age-related tauopathy (PART). However, distinctive phospho-tau aggregates were observed subjacent to the subpial TTR amyloid deposits in all regions of the neocortex, including the primary motor and striate cortices, suggesting a potential link between TTR amyloid and neocortical tauopathy. Our report reveals novel insights into the potential neuropathologic substrates of dementia in variant TTR amyloidosis that need to be investigated in larger autopsy series."
"Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS) presents with a variety of clinical phenotypes including motor impairments such as gait dysfunction, rigidity, tremor and bradykinesia as well as cognitive deficits including personality changes and dementia. In recent years, colony stimulating factor 1 receptor gene (CSF1R) has been identified as the primary genetic cause of HDLS. We describe the clinical and neuropathological features in three siblings with HDLS and the CSF1R p.Arg782His (c.2345G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A) pathogenic mutation. Each case had varied motor symptoms and clinical features, but all included slowed movements, poor balance, memory impairment and frontal deficits. Neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging revealed atrophy and increased signal in the deep white matter. Abundant white matter spheroids and CD68-positive macrophages were the predominant pathologies in these cases. Similar to other cases reported in the literature, the three cases described here had varied clinical phenotypes with a pronounced, but heterogeneous distribution of axonal spheroids and distinct microglia morphology. Our findings underscore the critical importance of genetic testing for establishing a clinical and pathological diagnosis of HDLS."

"Septic encephalopathy is associated with rapid deterioration of cortical functions. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) we detected functional abnormalities in the hippocampal formation of patients with septic delirium. Hippocampal dysfunction was further investigated in an animal model for sepsis using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injections to induce endotoxemia in rats, followed by electrophysiological recordings in brain slices. Endotoxemia induced a deficit in long term potentiation which was completely reversed by apamin, a blocker of small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels, and partly restored by treatment with physostigmine (eserine), an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, or TBPB, a selective M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist. These results suggest a novel role for SK channels in the etiology of endotoxemia and explain why boosting cholinergic function restores deficits in synaptic plasticity. Drugs which enhance cholinergic or M1 activity in the brain may prove beneficial in treatment of septic delirium in the intensive care unit."
"After publication of this article it was noticed there was an error in the Methods section under the subsection: Protein extraction and western blot analysis.

"Autosomal dominant adult-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (AD-ANCL) is a multisystem disease caused by mutations in the DNAJC5 gene. DNAJC5 encodes Cysteine String Protein-alpha (CSP&#x3b1;), a putative synaptic protein. AD-ANCL has been traditionally considered a lysosomal storage disease based on the intracellular accumulation of ceroid material. Here, we report for the first time the pathological findings of a patient in a clinically early stage of disease, which exhibits the typical neuronal intracellular ceroid accumulation and incipient neuroinflammation but no signs of brain atrophy, neurodegeneration or massive synaptic loss. Interestingly, we found minimal or no apparent reductions in CSP&#x3b1; or synaptophysin in the neuropil. In contrast, brain homogenates from terminal AD-ANCL patients exhibit significant reductions in SNARE-complex forming presynaptic protein levels, including a significant reduction in CSP&#x3b1; and SNAP-25. Frozen samples for the biochemical analyses of synaptic proteins were not available for the early stage AD-ANLC patient. These results suggest that the degeneration seen in the patients with AD-ANCL reported here might be a consequence of both the early effects of CSP&#x3b1; mutations at the cellular soma, most likely lysosome function, and subsequent neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction."

"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare, yet rapidly-progressive neurodegenerative disease that presents clinically with autonomic failure in combination with parkinsonism or cerebellar ataxia. The definitive neuropathology differentiating MSA from Lewy body diseases is the presence of &#x3b1;-synuclein aggregates in oligodendrocytes (called glial cytoplasmic inclusion or GCI) rather than the fibrillar aggregates in neurons (called Lewy bodies). This makes the pathological pathway(s) in MSA unique in that oligodendrocytes are involved rather than predominantly neurons, as is most other neurodegenerative disorders. MSA is therefore regarded as an oligodendrogliopathy. The etiology of MSA is unknown. No definitive risk factors have been identified, although &#x3b1;-synuclein and other genes have been variably linked to MSA risk. Utilization of postmortem brain tissues has greatly advanced our understanding of GCI pathology and the subsequent neurodegeneration. However, extrapolating the early pathogenesis of MSA from such resource has been difficult and limiting. In recent years, cell and animal models developed for MSA have been instrumental in delineating unique MSA pathological pathways, as well as aiding in clinical phenotyping. The purpose of this review is to bring together and discuss various animal models that have been developed for MSA and how they have advanced our understanding of MSA pathogenesis, particularly the dynamics of &#x3b1;-synuclein aggregation. This review will also discuss how animal models have been used to explore potential therapeutic avenues for MSA, and future directions of MSA modeling."

"In Alzheimer's disease (AD) a variety of amyloid &#x3b2;-peptides (A&#x3b2;) are deposited in the form of extracellular diffuse and neuritic plaques (NP), as well as within the vasculature. The generation of A&#x3b2; from its precursor, the amyloid precursor protein (APP), is a highly complex procedure that involves subsequent proteolysis of APP by &#x3b2;- and &#x3b3;-secretases. Brain accumulation of A&#x3b2; due to impaired A&#x3b2; degradation and/or altered ratios between the different A&#x3b2; species produced is believed to play a pivotal role in AD pathogenesis. While the presence of A&#x3b2;40 and A&#x3b2;42 in vascular and parenchymal amyloid have been subject of extensive studies, the deposition of carboxyterminal truncated A&#x3b2; peptides in AD has not received comparable attention. In the current study, we for the first time demonstrate the immunohistochemical localization of A&#x3b2;37 and A&#x3b2;39 in human sporadic AD (SAD). Our study further included the analysis of familial AD (FAD) cases carrying the APP mutations KM670/671NL, E693G and I716F, as well as a case of the PSEN1 &#x394;Exon9 mutation. A&#x3b2;37 and A&#x3b2;39 were found to be widely distributed within the vasculature in the brains of the majority of studied SAD and FAD cases, the latter also presenting considerable amounts of A&#x3b2;37 containing NPs. In addition, both peptides were found to be present in extracellular plaques but only scarce within the vasculature in brains of a variety of transgenic AD mouse models. Taken together, our study indicates the importance of C-terminally truncated A&#x3b2; in sporadic and familial AD and raises questions about how these species are generated and regulated."
"The transmembrane protein assembly &#x3b3;-secretase is a key protease in regulated intramembrane processing (RIP) of around 100 type-1 transmembrane proteins. Importantly, it has a pathological role in Alzheimer disease (AD) as it generates the neurotoxic amyloid &#x3b2;-peptide from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Studies on &#x3b3;-secretase location are therefore crucial both from a biological and a therapeutic perspective. Despite several years of efforts in many laboratories, it is not clear where in the neuron &#x3b3;-secretase exerts it's activities. Technical challenges include the fact that the active enzyme contains four protein components and that most subcellular compartments cannot be spatially resolved by traditional light microscopy. Here, we have used a powerful combination of the two nanoscopy techniques STORM and STED microscopy to visualize the location of &#x3b3;-secretase in neurons using an active-site specific probe, with a focus on the synapse. We show that &#x3b3;-secretase is present in both the pre-and postsynaptic compartments. We further show that the enzyme is enriched very close to the synaptic cleft in the postsynaptic membrane, as well as to NMDA receptors, demonstrating that &#x3b3;-secretase is present in the postsynaptic plasma membrane. Importantly, the expression of &#x3b3;-secretase increased in the pre- and postsynaptic compartments with the size of the synapse, suggesting a correlation between &#x3b3;-secretase activity and synapse maturation. Thus, our data shows the synaptic location with high precision in three dimensions and settles the long-lasting debate on the synaptic location of &#x3b3;-secretase."
"Pneumococcal meningitis is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity. We systematically assessed brain histopathology of 31 patients who died of pneumococcal meningitis from a nationwide study (median age 67 years; 21 (67 %) were male) using a pathology score including inflammation and vascular damage. Of the 27 patients with known time from the admission to death, 14 patients died within 7 days of admission and 13 after 7 days of admission. Eleven of 25 (44 %) patients had been treated with adjunctive dexamethasone therapy. Observed pathological processes were inflammation of medium-large arteries in 30 brains (97 %), cerebral haemorrhage in 24 (77 %), cerebritis in 24 (77 %), thrombosis in 21 (68 %), infarction in 19 (61 %) and ventriculitis in 19 (of 28 cases, 68 %). Inflammation of medium-large arteries led to obstruction of the vascular lumen in 14 (of 31 cases, 45 %). Vascular inflammation was associated with infarction and thrombosis of brain parenchymal vessels. Hippocampal dentate gyrus apoptosis between patients treated with and without dexamethasone was similar (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.66); however, dexamethasone treated patients had higher total pathology score than non-dexamethasone treated patients (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003). Our study shows that vascular damage is key in the process of brain damage in pneumococcal meningitis. Data and material of this study will be made open-access for translational research in pneumococcal meningitis (MeninGene-Path)."
"To clarify the role of &#x3b1;-synuclein (&#x3b1;Syn) in neuronal membrane remodeling, we analyzed the expression of &#x3b1;Syn in neurons with a dysfunction of PLA2G6, which is indispensable for membrane remodeling. &#x3b1;Syn/phosphorylated-&#x3b1;Syn (P&#x3b1;Syn) distribution and neurodegeneration were quantitatively estimated in PLA2G6-knockout (KO) mice, which demonstrate marked mitochondrial membrane degeneration. We also assessed the relationship between &#x3b1;Syn deposits and mitochondria in brain tissue from patients with PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN) and Parkinson's disease (PD), and quantitatively examined Lewy bodies (LBs) and neurons. The expression level of &#x3b1;Syn was elevated in PLA2G6-knockdown cells and KO mouse neurons. Strong P&#x3b1;Syn expression was observed in neuronal granules in KO mice before onset of motor symptoms. The granules were mitochondrial outer membrane protein (TOM20)-positive. Ultramicroscopy revealed that P&#x3b1;Syn-positive granules were localized to mitochondria with degenerated inner membranes. After symptom onset, TOM20-positive granules were frequently found in ubiquitinated spheroids, where P&#x3b1;Syn expression was low. Axons were atrophic, but the neuronal loss was not evident in KO mice. In PLAN neurons, small P&#x3b1;Syn-positive inclusions with a TOM20-positive edge were frequently observed and clustered into LBs. The surfaces of most LBs were TOM20-positive in PLAN and TOM20-negative in PD brains. The high proportion of LB-bearing neurons and the preserved neuronal number in PLAN suggested long-term survival of LB-bearing neurons. Elevated expression of &#x3b1;Syn/P&#x3b1;Syn in mitochondria appears to be the early response to PLA2G6-deficiency in neurons. The strong affinity of &#x3b1;Syn for damaged mitochondrial membranes may promote membrane stabilization of mitochondria and neuronal survival in neurons."
"A hallmark of several major neurological diseases is neuronal cell death. In addition to this primary pathology, secondary injury is seen in connected brain regions in which neurons not directly affected by the disease are denervated. These transneuronal effects on the network contribute considerably to the clinical symptoms. Since denervated neurons are viable, they are attractive targets for intervention. Therefore, we studied the role of Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-receptor signaling, the target of Fingolimod (FTY720), in denervation-induced dendritic atrophy. The entorhinal denervation in vitro model was used to assess dendritic changes of denervated mouse dentate granule cells. Live-cell microscopy of GFP-expressing granule cells in organotypic entorhino-hippocampal slice cultures was employed to follow individual dendritic segments for up to 6&#xa0;weeks after deafferentation. A set of slice cultures was treated with FTY720 or the S1P-receptor (S1PR) antagonist VPC23019. Lesion-induced changes in S1P (mass spectrometry) and S1PR-mRNA levels (laser microdissection and qPCR) were determined. Denervation caused profound changes in dendritic stability. Dendritic elongation and retraction events were markedly increased, resulting in a net reduction of total dendritic length (TDL) during the first 2 weeks after denervation, followed by a gradual recovery in TDL. These changes were accompanied by an increase in S1P and S1PR1- and S1PR3-mRNA levels, and were not observed in slice cultures treated with FTY720 or VPC23019. We conclude that inhibition of S1PR signaling prevents dendritic destabilization and denervation-induced dendrite loss. These results suggest a novel neuroprotective effect for pharmaceuticals targeting neural S1PR pathways."
"Choreoathetoid involuntary movements are rarely reported in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), suggesting their exclusion as a supportive feature in clinical diagnostic criteria for FTLD. Here, we identified three cases of the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) that display chorea with fused in sarcoma (FUS)-positive inclusions (FTLD-FUS) and the basophilic inclusion body disease (BIBD) subtype. We determined the behavioral and cognitive features in this group that were distinct from other FTLD-FUS cases. We also reviewed the clinical records of 72 FTLD cases, and clarified additional clinical features that are predictive of the BIBD pathology. Symptom onset in the three patients with chorea was at 44.0&#xa0;years of age (&#xb1;12.0&#xa0;years), and occurred in the absence of a family history of dementia. The cases were consistent with a clinical form of FTD known as bvFTD, as well as reduced neurological muscle tone in addition to chorea. The three patients showed no or mild parkinsonism, which by contrast, increased substantially in the other FTLD cases until a later stage of disease. The three patients exhibited severe caudate atrophy, which has previously been reported as a histological feature distinguishing FTLD-FUS from FTLD-tau or FTLD-TAR DNA-binding protein 43. Thus, our findings suggest that the clinical feature of choreoathetosis in bvFTD might be associated with FTLD-FUS, and in particular, with the BIBD subtype."
"The observation showing that Lewy type synucleinopathy (LTS), the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), is found in the gut of almost all PD subjects led to a substantial amount of research to develop a diagnostic procedure in living patients based on endoscopically obtained gastrointestinal biopsies. However, the existing studies have provided conflicting results regarding the sensitivity and specificity of gastrointestinal biopsies for the detection of LTS. We therefore undertook a multi-center staining and blinded judging of a common set of slides from colonic biopsies to determine the optimal protocol for the detection of LTS. Four different immunohistochemical methods, developed in four separate expert laboratories, were evaluated for their sensitivity and specificity to detect enteric LTS. Test sets of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from biopsies of 9 PD subjects and 3 controls were stained with the 4 methods and graded by 4 different observers. Four types of staining morphology (granular staining in the lamina propria, perivascular/vascular wall staining in the submucosa, lacy-granular pattern in the submucosa and epithelial cell nuclear staining) were variably observed in the slides stained by the 4 methods. Positive alpha-synuclein staining was observed by all 5 judges in most of the slides from control cases, regardless of the staining methods that were used. Moreover, none of the tested method or staining pattern had a specificity and sensitivity more than 80&#xa0;% regarding to PD. Overall, our study suggest that the tested methods are not adequate for the prediction of PD using gastrointestinal biopsies. Future studies are warranted to test new immunostaining methods."
"A non-coding hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in C9orf72 is a common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) acting through a loss of function mechanism due to haploinsufficiency of C9orf72 or a gain of function mediated by aggregates of bidirectionally transcribed HRE-RNAs translated into di-peptide repeat (DPR) proteins. To fully understand regulation of C9orf72 expression we surveyed the C9orf72 locus using Cap Analysis of Gene Expression sequence data (CAGEseq). We observed C9orf72 was generally lowly expressed with the exception of a subset of myeloid cells, particularly CD14+ monocytes that showed up to seven fold higher expression as compared to central nervous system (CNS) and other tissues. The expression profile at the C9orf72 locus showed a complex architecture with differential expression of the transcription start sites (TSSs) for the annotated C9orf72 transcripts between myeloid and CNS tissues suggesting cell and/or tissue specific functions. We further detected novel TSSs in both the sense and antisense strand at the C9orf72 locus and confirmed their existence in brain tissues and CD14+ monocytes. Interestingly, our experiments showed a consistent decrease of C9orf72 coding transcripts not only in brain tissue and monocytes from C9orf72-HRE patients, but also in brains from MAPT and GRN mutation carriers together with an increase in antisense transcripts suggesting these could play a role in regulation of C9orf72. We found that the non-HRE related expression changes cannot be explained by promoter methylation but by the presence of the C9orf72-HRE risk haplotype and unknown functional interactions between C9orf72, MAPT and GRN."
"Dermatomyositis (DM) can occur in both adults and juveniles with considerable clinical differences. The links between immune-mediated mechanisms and vasculopathy with respect to development of perifascicular pathology are incompletely understood. We investigated skeletal muscle from newly diagnosed, treatment-na&#xef;ve juvenile (jDM) and adult dermatomyositis (aDM) patients focusing on hypoxia-related pathomechanisms, vessel pathology, and immune mechanisms especially in the perifascicular region. Therefore, we assessed the skeletal muscle biopsies from 21 aDM, and 15 jDM patients by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Transcriptional analyses of genes involved in hypoxia, as well as in innate and adaptive immunity were performed by quantitative Polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of whole tissue cross sections including perifascicular muscle fibers.Through these analysis, we found that basic features of DM, like perifascicular atrophy and inflammatory infiltrates, were present at similar levels in jDM and aDM patients. However, jDM was characterized by predominantly hypoxia-driven pathology in perifascicular small fibers and by macrophages expressing markers of hypoxia. A more pronounced regional loss of capillaries, but no relevant activation of type-1 Interferon (IFN)-associated pathways was noted. Conversely, in aDM, IFN-related genes were expressed at significantly elevated levels, and Interferon-stimulated gene (ISG)15 was strongly positive in small perifascicular fibers whereas hypoxia-related mechanisms did not play a significant role.In our study we could provide new molecular data suggesting a conspicuous pathophysiological 'dichotomy' between jDM and aDM: In jDM, perifascicular atrophy is tightly linked to hypoxia-related pathology, and poorly to innate immunity. In aDM, perifascicular atrophy is prominently associated with molecules driving innate immunity, while hypoxia-related mechanisms seem to be less relevant."
"Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that can produce marked neurological deficit. Current NMO therapies include immunosuppressants, plasma exchange and B-cell depletion. Here, we evaluated 14 potential remyelinating drugs emerging from prior small molecule screens done to identify drugs for repurposing in multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating neurological diseases. Compounds were initially evaluated in oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) and cerebellar slice cultures, and then in a mouse model of NMO produced by intracerebral injection of anti-AQP4 autoantibody (AQP4-IgG) and human complement characterized by demyelination with minimal axonal damage. The FDA-approved drug clobetasol promoted differentiation in OPC cultures and remyelination in cerebellar slice cultures and in mice. Intraperitoneal administration of 2&#xa0;mg/kg/day clobetasol reduced myelin loss by ~60&#xa0;%, even when clobetasol was administered after demyelination occurred. Clobetasol increased the number of mature oligodendrocytes within lesions without significantly altering initial astrocyte damage or inflammation. These results provide proof-of-concept for the potential utility of a remyelinating approach in the treatment of NMO."
"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, yet disease-modifying treatments do not currently exist. Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) was recently described as a novel neuroprotective target in PD. Since alpha-synuclein (&#x3b1;-Syn) aggregation is a major hallmark in the pathogenesis of PD, we aimed to evaluate the anti-aggregative potential of pharmacological ROCK inhibition using the isoquinoline derivative Fasudil, a small molecule inhibitor already approved for clinical use in humans. Fasudil treatment significantly reduced &#x3b1;-Syn aggregation in vitro in a H4 cell culture model as well as in a cell-free assay. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis revealed a direct binding of Fasudil to tyrosine residues Y133 and Y136 in the C-terminal region of &#x3b1;-Syn. Importantly, this binding was shown to be biologically relevant using site-directed mutagenesis of these residues in the cell culture model. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of long-term Fasudil treatment on &#x3b1;-Syn pathology in vivo in a transgenic mouse model overexpressing human &#x3b1;-Syn bearing the A53T mutation (&#x3b1;-Syn(A53T) mice). Fasudil treatment improved motor and cognitive functions in &#x3b1;-Syn(A53T) mice as determined by Catwalk(TM) gait analysis and novel object recognition (NOR), without apparent side effects. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant reduction of &#x3b1;-Syn pathology in the midbrain of &#x3b1;-Syn(A53T) mice after Fasudil treatment. Our results demonstrate that Fasudil, next to its effects mediated by ROCK-inhibition, directly interacts with &#x3b1;-Syn and attenuates &#x3b1;-Syn pathology. This underscores the translational potential of Fasudil as a disease-modifying drug for the treatment of PD and other synucleinopathies."
"Neurological diseases associated with neuronal death are also accompanied by axonal denervation of connected brain regions. In these areas, denervation leads to a decrease in afferent drive, which may in turn trigger active central nervous system (CNS) circuitry rearrangement. This rewiring process is important therapeutically, since it can partially recover functions and can be further enhanced using modern rehabilitation strategies. Nevertheless, the cellular mechanisms of brain rewiring are not fully understood. We recently reported a mechanism by which neurons remodel their local connectivity under conditions of network-perturbance: hippocampal pyramidal cells can extend spine head protrusions (SHPs), which reach out toward neighboring terminals and form new synapses. Since this form of activity-dependent rewiring is observed only on some spines, we investigated the required conditions. We speculated, that the actin-associated protein synaptopodin, which is involved in several synaptic plasticity mechanisms, could play a role in the formation and/or stabilization of SHPs. Using hippocampal slice cultures, we found that ~70 % of spines with protrusions in CA1 pyramidal neurons contained synaptopodin. Analysis of synaptopodin-deficient neurons revealed that synaptopodin is required for the stability but not the formation of SHPs. The effects of synaptopodin could be linked to its role in Ca(2+) homeostasis, since spines with protrusions often contained ryanodine receptors and synaptopodin. Furthermore, disrupting Ca(2+) signaling shortened protrusion lifetime. By transgenically reintroducing synaptopodin on a synaptopodin-deficient background, SHP stability could be rescued. Overall, we show that synaptopodin increases the stability of SHPs, and could potentially modulate the rewiring of microcircuitries by making synaptic reorganization more efficient."
"Approximately 20&#xa0;% of familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is caused by mutations in superoxide dismutase (SOD1), which leads to misfolding of the SOD1 protein, resulting in a toxic gain of function. Several conformation-restricted antibodies have been generated that specifically recognize misfolded SOD1 protein, and have been used as therapeutics in pre-clinical models. Misfolded SOD1 selectively associates with spinal cord mitochondria in SOD1 rodent models. Using the SOD1(G93A) rat model, we find that SOD1 conformational specific antibodies AMF7-63 and DSE2-3H1 labeled a fibrillar network concentrated in the anterior horn; while A5C3, B8H10, C4F6 and D3H5 labeled motor neurons as well as puncta in the neuropil. There is a time-dependent accumulation of misfolded SOD1 at the surface of spinal cord mitochondria with AMF7-63-labeled mitochondria having increased volume in contrast to a mitochondrial subset labeled with B8H10. In spinal cord homogenates and isolated mitochondria, AMF7-63, DSE2-3H1 and B8H10 detect misfolded SOD1 aggregates. SOD1 that lacks its metal cofactors has an increased affinity for na&#xef;ve mitochondria and misfolded SOD1 antibodies B8H10 and DSE2-3H1 readily detect demetalated mutant and wild-type SOD1. Together, these data suggest that multiple non-native species of misfolded SOD1 may exist, some of which are associated with mitochondrial damage. Conformational antibodies are invaluable tools to identify and characterize the variation in misfolded SOD1 species with regards to biochemical characteristics and toxicity. This information is highly relevant to the further development of these reagents as therapeutics."
"Mutations of the human plectin gene (PLEC) on chromosome 8q24 cause autosomal recessive epidermolysis bullosa simplex with muscular dystrophy (EBS-MD). In the present study we analyzed the downstream effects of PLEC mutations on plectin protein expression and localization, the structure of the extrasarcomeric desmin cytoskeleton, protein aggregate formation and mitochondrial distribution in skeletal muscle tissue from three EBS-MD patients. PLEC gene analysis in a not previously reported 35-year-old EBS-MD patient with additional disease features of cardiomyopathy and malignant arrhythmias revealed novel compound heterozygous (p.(Phe755del) and p.(Lys1040Argfs*139)) mutations resulting in complete abolition of plectin protein expression. In contrast, the other two patients with different homozygous PLEC mutations showed preserved plectin protein expression with one only expressing rodless plectin variants, and the other markedly reduced protein levels. Analysis of skeletal muscle tissue from all three patients revealed severe disruption of the extrasarcomeric intermediate filament cytoskeleton, protein aggregates positive for desmin, syncoilin, and synemin, degenerative myofibrillar changes, and mitochondrial abnormalities comprising respiratory chain dysfunction and an altered organelle distribution and amount.Our study demonstrates that EBS-MD causing PLEC mutations universally result in a desmin protein aggregate myopathy phenotype despite marked differences in individual plectin protein expression patterns. Since plectin is the key cytolinker protein that regulates the structural and functional organization of desmin filaments, the defective anchorage and spacing of assembled desmin filaments is the key pathogenetic event that triggers the formation of desmin protein aggregates as well as secondary mitochondrial pathology."
"Pneumococcal meningitis is the most common and severe form of bacterial meningitis. Fatality rates are substantial, and long-term sequelae develop in about half of survivors. Here, we have performed a prospective nationwide genetic association study using the Human Exome BeadChip and identified gene variants in encoding dynactin 4 (DCTN4), retinoic acid early transcript 1E (RAET1E), and V-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 3 (AKT3) to be associated with unfavourable outcome in patients with pneumococcal meningitis. No clinical replication cohort is available, so we validated the role of one of these targets, AKT3, in a pneumococcal meningitis mouse model. Akt3 deficient mice had worse survival and increased histopathology scores for parenchymal damage (infiltration) and vascular infiltration (large meningeal artery inflammation) but similar bacterial loads, cytokine responses, compared to wild-type mice. We found no differences in cerebrospinal fluid cytokine levels between patients with risk or non-risk alleles. Patients with the risk genotype (rs10157763, AA) presented with low scores on the Glasgow Coma Scale and high rate of epileptic seizures. Thus, our results show that AKT3 influences outcome of pneumococcal meningitis."
"Tissue invasion and infiltration by brain tumours poses a clinical challenge, with destruction of structures leading to morbidity. We assessed whether micro-CT could be used to map tumour invasion in adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma (ACP), and whether it could delineate ACPs and their intrinsic components from surrounding tissue.Three anonymised archival frozen ACP samples were fixed, iodinated and imaged using a micro-CT scanner prior to the use of standard histological processing and immunohistochemical techniques.We demonstrate that micro-CT imaging can non-destructively give detailed 3D structural information of tumours in volumes with isotropic voxel sizes of 4-6 microns, which can be correlated with traditional histology and immunohistochemistry.Such information complements classical histology by facilitating virtual slicing of the tissue in any plane and providing unique detail of the three dimensional relationships of tissue compartments."
"Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) account for about a third of all brain tumours in children. We conducted a detailed study of DNA methylation and gene expression to improve our understanding of the biology of pilocytic and diffuse astrocytomas. Pilocytic astrocytomas were found to have a distinctive signature at 315 CpG sites, of which 312 were hypomethylated and 3 were hypermethylated. Genomic analysis revealed that 182 of these sites are within annotated enhancers. The signature was not present in diffuse astrocytomas, or in published profiles of other brain tumours and normal brain tissue. The AP-1 transcription factor was predicted to bind within 200&#xa0;bp of a subset of the 315 differentially methylated CpG sites; the AP-1 factors, FOS and FOSL1 were found to be up-regulated in pilocytic astrocytomas. We also analysed splice variants of the AP-1 target gene, CCND1, which encodes cell cycle regulator cyclin D1. CCND1a was found to be highly expressed in both pilocytic and diffuse astrocytomas, but diffuse astrocytomas have far higher expression of the oncogenic variant, CCND1b. These findings highlight novel genetic and epigenetic differences between pilocytic and diffuse astrocytoma, in addition to well-described alterations involving BRAF, MYB and FGFR1."
"Hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene is a leading cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Reduced expression of C9orf72 has been proposed as a possible disease mechanism. However, the cellular function of C9orf72 remains to be characterized. Here we report the identification of two binding partners of C9orf72: SMCR8 and WDR41. We show that WDR41 interacts with the C9orf72/SMCR8 heterodimer and WDR41 is tightly associated with the Golgi complex. We further demonstrate that C9orf72/SMCR8/WDR41 associates with the FIP200/Ulk1 complex, which is essential for autophagy initiation. C9orf72 deficient mice, generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, show severe inflammation in multiple organs, including lymph node, spleen and liver. Lymph node enlargement and severe splenomegaly are accompanied with macrophage infiltration. Increased levels of autophagy and lysosomal proteins and autophagy defects were detected in both the spleen and liver of C9orf72 deficient mice, supporting an in vivo role of C9orf72 in regulating the autophagy/lysosome pathway. In summary, our study elucidates potential physiological functions of C9orf72 and disease mechanisms of ALS/FTLD."
"Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the occurrence of visceral and neurological symptoms. At present, the molecular mechanisms causing neurodegeneration in this disease are unknown. Here we report the altered expression and/or mislocalization of the TAR-DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in both NPC mouse and in a human neuronal model of the disease. We also report the neuropathologic study of a NPC patient's brain, showing that while TDP-43 is below immunohistochemical detection in nuclei of cerebellar Purkinje cells, it has a predominant localization in the cytoplasm of these cells. From a functional point of view, the TDP-43 mislocalization, that occurs in a human experimental neuronal model system, is associated with specific alterations in TDP-43 controlled genes. Most interestingly, treatment with N-Acetyl-cysteine (NAC) or beta-cyclodextrin (CD) can partially restore TDP-43 nuclear localization. Taken together, the results of these studies extend the role of TDP-43 beyond the Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/frontotemporal dementia (FTD)/Alzheimer disease (AD) spectrum. These findings may open novel research/therapeutic avenues for a better understanding of both NPC disease and the TDP-43 proteinopathy disease mechanism."
"Purkinje cell pathology is a common finding in a range of inherited and acquired cerebellar disorders, with the degree of Purkinje cell injury dependent on the underlying aetiology. Purkinje cells have an unparalleled resistance to insult and display unique regenerative capabilities within the central nervous system. Their response to cell injury is not typical of most neurons and likely represents both degenerative, compensatory and regenerative mechanisms. Here we present a pathological study showing novel and fundamental insights into Purkinje cell injury, remodelling and repair in Friedreich's ataxia; the most common inherited ataxia. Analysing post-mortem cerebellum tissue from patients who had Friedreich's ataxia, we provide evidence of significant injury to the Purkinje cell axonal compartment with relative preservation of both the perikaryon and its extensive dendritic arborisation. Axonal remodelling of Purkinje cells was clearly elevated in the disease. For the first time in a genetic condition, we have also shown a disease-related increase in the frequency of Purkinje cell fusion and heterokaryon formation in Friedreich's ataxia cases; with evidence that underlying levels of cerebellar inflammation influence heterokaryon formation. Our results together further demonstrate the Purkinje cell's unique plasticity and regenerative potential. Elucidating the biological mechanisms behind these phenomena could have significant clinical implications for manipulating neuronal repair in response to neurological injury."
"The adaptor protein NHERF1 (Na/H exchanger-3 regulatory factor-1) and its associated ezrin-radixin-moesin-merlin/neurofibromin-2 (ERM-NF2) family proteins are required for epithelial morphogenesis and have been implicated in cancer progression. NHERF1 is expressed in ependymal cells and constitutes a highly sensitive diagnostic marker for ependymoma, where it labels membrane polarity structures. Since NHERF1 and ERM-NF2 proteins show polarized expression in choroid plexus (CP) cells, we tested their diagnostic utility in CP neoplasms. NHERF1 immunohistochemistry in 43 adult and pediatric tumors with papillary morphology revealed strong apical plasma membrane staining in CP papilloma (WHO grade I) and cytoplasmic expression in CP carcinoma (WHO grade III). Ezrin and moesin showed similar but less distinctive staining. NHERF1 also labeled papillary tumors of the pineal region in a microlumen and focal apical membrane pattern, suggestive of a transitional morphology between CP papilloma and ependymoma. CP tumors of all grades could be differentiated from metastatic carcinomas with papillary architecture by NF2, which showed polarized membranous staining in CP tumors. NHERF1 and NF2 immunohistochemistry showed enhanced sensitivity and specificity for CP tumors compared to commonly used markers, including cytokeratins and Kir7.1, emerging as reliable diagnostic tools for the differential diagnosis of papillary tumors of the central nervous system."
"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients frequently experience well formed recurrent complex visual hallucinations (RCVH). This is associated with reduced blood flow or hypometabolism on imaging of the primary visual cortex. To understand these associations in DLB we used pathological and biochemical analysis of the primary visual cortex to identify changes that could underpin RCVH. Alpha-synuclein or neurofibrillary tangle pathology in primary visual cortex was essentially absent. Neurone density or volume within the primary visual cortex in DLB was also unchanged using unbiased stereology. Microarray analysis, however, demonstrated changes in neuropeptide gene expression and other markers, indicating altered GABAergic neuronal function. Calcium binding protein and GAD65/67 immunohistochemistry showed preserved interneurone populations indicating possible interneurone dysfunction. This was demonstrated by loss of post synaptic GABA receptor markers including gephyrin, GABARAP, and Kif5A, indicating reduced GABAergic synaptic activity. Glutamatergic neuronal signalling was also altered with vesicular glutamate transporter protein and PSD-95 expression being reduced. Changes to the primary visual cortex in DLB indicate that reduced GABAergic transmission may contribute to RCVH in DLB and treatment using targeted GABAergic modulation or similar approaches using glutamatergic modification may be beneficial."
"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are types of major TDP-43 (43-kDa TAR DNA-binding protein) proteinopathy. Cortical TDP-43 pathology has been analyzed in detail in cases of FTLD-TDP, but is still unclear in cases of ALS. We attempted to clarify the cortical and subcortical TDP-43 pathology in Japanese cases of sporadic ALS (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;96) using an antibody specific to phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43). The cases were divided into two groups: those without pTDP-43-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in the hippocampal dentate granule cells (Type 1, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;63), and those with such inclusions (Type 2, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;33). Furthermore, the Type 2 cases were divided into two subgroups based on semi-quantitative estimation of pTDP-43-positive dystrophic neurites (DNs) in the temporal neocortex: Type 2a (accompanied by no or few DNs, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;22) and Type 2b (accompanied by abundant DNs, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11). Clinico-pathologic analysis revealed that cognitive impairment was a feature in patients with Type 2a and Type 2b, but not in those with Type 1, and that importantly, Type 2b is a distinct subtype characterized by a poor prognosis despite the less severe loss of lower motor neurons, the unusual subcortical dendrospinal pTDP-43 pathology, and more prominent glial involvement in cortical pTDP-43 pathology than other two groups. Considering the patient survival time and severity of motor neuron loss in each group, transition from Type 1 to Type 2, or from Type 2a to Type 2b during the disease course appeared unlikely. Therefore, each of these three groups was regarded as an independent subtype."
"Alzheimer disease is characterized by the accumulation of &#x3b2;-amyloid (A&#x3b2;) plaques and tau-laden neurofibrillary tangles. Emerging studies suggest that in neurodegenerative diseases, aggregation of one protein species can promote other proteinopathies and that inflammation plays an important role in this process. To study the interplay between A&#x3b2; deposition, tau pathology, and microgliosis, we established a new AD transgenic mouse model by crossing 5xfAD mice with Thy-Tau22 transgenic mice. The resulting 'T5x' mice exhibit a greater than three-fold increase in misfolded and hyperphosphorylated tau and further substantiates the hypothesis that A&#x3b2; accelerates tau pathology. Surprisingly, T5x mice exhibit a 40-50&#xa0;% reduction in A&#x3b2; plaque load and insoluble A&#x3b2; species when compared with aged-matched 5xfAD littermates. T5x mice exhibit significant changes in cytokine production, an almost doubling of microglial number, and a dramatic shift in microglia activation state. Furthermore, T5x microglia exhibit increased phagocytic capacity that enhances the clearance of insoluble A&#x3b2; and decreasing plaque load. Therefore, our results suggest that strategies to increase the phagocytic ability of microglia can be employed to reduce A&#x3b2; and that tau-induced changes in microglial activation state can promote the clearance of A&#x3b2;."
"Alexander&#xa0;disease is a&#xa0;fatal&#xa0;neurological illness characterized by white-matter degeneration and formation of Rosenthal fibers, which contain glial fibrillary acidic protein as astrocytic inclusion. Alexander&#xa0;disease is mainly caused by&#xa0;a gene mutation encoding glial fibrillary acidic protein, although the underlying pathomechanism remains unclear. We established induced pluripotent stem cells from Alexander&#xa0;disease patients, and&#xa0;differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells into&#xa0;astrocytes. Alexander&#xa0;disease patient astrocytes exhibited Rosenthal fiber-like structures, a key Alexander&#xa0;disease pathology, and increased inflammatory cytokine release compared to healthy control. These results suggested that Alexander&#xa0;disease astrocytes contribute to leukodystrophy and a variety of symptoms as an inflammatory source in the Alexander&#xa0;disease patient brain.&#xa0;Astrocytes, differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells of Alexander disease, could be a cellular model for future translational medicine."
"Inflammation is becoming increasingly recognized as an important contributor to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. As a part of the innate immune system, the complement cascade enhances the body's ability to destroy and remove pathogens and has recently been shown to influence Alzheimer's associated amyloid and tau pathology. However, little is known in humans about the effects of the complement system and genetic modifiers of AD risk like the &#x3b5;4 allele of apolioprotein E (APOE &#x3b5;4) on AD pathobiology. We evaluated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein levels from 267 individuals clinically diagnosed as cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and AD. Using linear models, we assessed the relationship between APOE &#x3b5;4 genotype, CSF Complement 3 (C3), CSF amyloid-&#x3b2; (amyloid) and CSF hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau). We found a significant interaction between APOE &#x3b5;4 and CSF C3 on both CSF amyloid and CSF ptau. We also found that CSF C3 is only associated with CSF ptau after accounting for CSF amyloid. Our results support a conceptual model of the AD pathogenic cascade where a synergistic relationship between the complement cascade (C3) and APOE &#x3b5;4 results in elevated Alzheimer's neurodegeneration and in turn, amyloid further regulates the effect of the complement cascade on downstream tau pathology."
"A neuro-inflammatory response is evident in Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the precise mechanisms by which neuro-inflammation influences the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain poorly understood. Type-1 interferons (IFNs) are master regulators of innate immunity and have been implicated in multiple CNS disorders, however their role in AD progression has not yet been fully investigated. Hence, we generated APPSWE/PS1&#x394;E9 mice lacking the type-1 IFN alpha receptor-1 (IFNAR1, APPSWE/PS1&#x394;E9 x IFNAR1(-/-)) aged to 9&#xa0;months to investigate the role of type-1 IFN signaling in a well-validated model of AD. APPSWE/PS1&#x394;E9 x IFNAR1(-/-) mice displayed a modest reduction in A&#x3b2; monomer levels, despite maintenance of plaque deposition. This finding correlated with partial rescue of spatial learning and memory impairments in the Morris water maze in comparison to APPSWE/PS1&#x394;E9 mice. Q-PCR identified a reduced type-1 IFN response and modulated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in APPSWE/PS1&#x394;E9 x IFNAR1(-/-) mice compared to APPSWE/PS1&#x394;E9 mice. Interestingly, immunohistochemistry displayed enhanced astrocyte reactivity but attenuated microgliosis surrounding amyloid plaque deposits in APPSWE/PS1&#x394;E9 x IFNAR1(-/-) mice in comparison to APPSWE/PS1&#x394;E9 mice. These APPSWE/PS1&#x394;E9 x IFNAR1(-/-) microglial populations demonstrated an anti-inflammatory phenotype that was confirmed in vitro by soluble A&#x3b2;1-42 treatment of IFNAR1(-/-) primary glial cultures. Our findings suggest that modulating neuro-inflammatory responses by suppressing type-1 IFN signaling may provide therapeutic benefit in AD."
"Human BK polyomavirus (BKV) is reactivated under conditions of immunosuppression leading most commonly to nephropathy or cystitis; its tropism for the brain is rare and poorly understood. We present a unique case of BKV-associated encephalopathy in a man with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia and immunodeficiency (HED-ID) due to IKK-gamma (NEMO) mutation, who developed progressive neurological symptoms. Brain biopsy demonstrated polyomavirus infection of gray and white matter, with predominant involvement of cortex and distinct neuronal tropism, in addition to limited demyelination and oligodendroglial inclusions. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated polyoma T-antigen in neurons and glia, but expression of VP1 capsid protein only in glia. PCR analysis on both brain biopsy tissue and cerebrospinal fluid detected high levels of BKV DNA. Sequencing studies further identified novel BKV variant and disclosed unique rearrangements in the noncoding control region of the viral DNA (BKVN NCCR). Neuropathological analysis also demonstrated an unusual form of obliterative fibrosing vasculopathy in the subcortical white matter with abnormal lysosomal accumulations, possibly related to the patient's underlying ectodermal dysplasia. Our report provides the first neuropathological description of HED-ID due to NEMO mutation, and expands the diversity of neurological presentations of BKV infection in brain, underscoring the importance of its consideration in immunodeficient patients with unexplained encephalopathy. We also document novel BKVN NCCR rearrangements that may be associated with the unique neuronal tropism in this patient."
"Multiple sclerosis is a devastating neurological disorder characterized by the autoimmune destruction of the central nervous system myelin. While T cells are known orchestrators of the immune response leading to MS pathology, the precise contribution of CNS resident and peripheral infiltrating myeloid cells is less well described. Here, we explore the myeloid cell function of Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1), a scavenger receptor involved in myelin clearance and the inflammatory response, in the context of Multiple sclerosis. Supporting its central role in Multiple sclerosis pathology, we find that LRP1 expression is increased in Multiple sclerosis lesions in comparison to the surrounding healthy tissue. Using two genetic mouse models, we show that deletion of LRP1 in microglia, but not in peripheral macrophages, negatively impacts the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of Multiple sclerosis. We further show&#xa0;that the increased disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis&#xa0;is not due to haplodeficiency of the&#xa0;Cx3cr1&#xa0;locus. At the cellular level, microglia lacking LRP1 adopt a pro-inflammatory phenotype characterized by amoeboid morphology and increased production of the inflammatory mediator TNF-&#x3b1;. We also show that LRP1 functions as a robust inhibitor of NF-kB activation in myeloid cells via a MyD88 dependent pathway, potentially explaining the increase in disease severity observed in mice lacking LRP1 expression in microglia. Taken together, our data suggest that the function of LRP1 in microglia is to keep these cells in an anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective status during inflammatory insult, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and potentially in Multiple sclerosis."
"Recent research findings have provided convincing evidence indicating a role for Interleukin-33 (IL-33) signalling pathway in a number of central nervous system (CNS) diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's disease. However, the exact function of IL-33 molecule within the CNS under normal and pathological conditions is currently unknown. In this study, we have mapped cellular expression of IL-33 and its receptor ST2 by immunohistochemistry in the brain tissues of MS patients and appropriate controls; and investigated the functional significance of these findings in vitro using a myelinating culture system. Our results demonstrate that IL-33 is expressed by neurons, astrocytes and microglia as well as oligodendrocytes, while ST2 is expressed in the lesions by oligodendrocytes and within and around axons. Furthermore, the expression levels and patterns of IL-33 and ST2 in the lesions of acute and chronic MS patient brain samples are enhanced compared with the healthy brain tissues. Finally, our data using rat myelinating co-cultures suggest that IL-33 may play an important role in MS development by inhibiting CNS myelination."
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterised by the death of upper (corticospinal) and lower motor neurons (MNs) with progressive muscle weakness. This incurable disease is clinically heterogeneous and its aetiology remains unknown. Increased excitability of corticospinal MNs has been observed prior to symptoms in human and rodent studies. Increased excitability has been correlated with structural changes in neuronal dendritic arbors and spines for decades. Here, using a modified Golgi-Cox staining method, we have made the first longitudinal study examining the dendrites of pyramidal neurons from the motor cortex, medial pre-frontal cortex, somatosensory cortex and entorhinal cortex of hSOD1(G93A) (SOD1) mice compared to wild-type (WT) littermate controls at postnatal (P) days 8-15, 28-35, 65-75 and 120. Progressive decreases in dendritic length and spine density commencing at pre-symptomatic ages (P8-15 or P28-35) were observed in layer V pyramidal neurons within the motor cortex and medial pre-frontal cortex of SOD1 mice compared to WT mice. Spine loss without concurrent dendritic pathology was present in the pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex from disease-onset (P65-75). Our results from the SOD1 model suggest that dendritic and dendritic spine changes foreshadow and underpin the neuromotor phenotypes present in ALS and may contribute to the varied cognitive, executive function and extra-motor symptoms commonly seen in ALS patients. Determining if these phenomena are compensatory or maladaptive may help explain differential susceptibility of neurons to degeneration in ALS."
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with breakdown of the myelin sheath that coats neurons in the central nervous system. The cause of MS is not known, although the pathogenesis involves destruction of myelin by the immune system. It was the aim of this study to examine the abundant myelin protein, myelin basic protein (MBP), to determine if there are sites of modification that may be characteristic for MS. MBP from the cerebellum was examined from controls and MS patients across the age range using mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. Amino acid racemization data indicated that myelin basic protein is long-lived and proteomic analysis of MBP showed it to be highly modified. A common modification of MBP was racemization of Asp and this was significantly greater in MS patients. In long-lived proteins, L-Asp and L-Asn can racemize to three other isomers, D-isoAsp, L-isoAsp and D-Asp and this is significant because isoAsp formation in peptides renders them immunogenic.Proteomic analysis revealed widespread modifications of MBP with two surface regions that are altered in MS. In particular, isoAsp was significantly elevated at these sites in MS patients. The generation of isoAsp could be responsible for eliciting an immune response to modified MBP and therefore be implicated in the etiology of MS."
"Vascular cognitive impairment is the second most common form of dementia. The pathogenic pathways leading to vascular cognitive impairment remain unclear but clinical and experimental data have shown that chronic reactive astrogliosis occurs within white matter lesions, indicating that a sustained pro-inflammatory environment affecting the white matter may contribute towards disease progression. To model vascular cognitive impairment, we induced prolonged mild cerebral hypoperfusion in mice by bilateral common carotid artery stenosis. This chronic hypoperfusion resulted in reactive gliosis of astrocytes and microglia within white matter tracts, demyelination and axonal degeneration, consecutive spatial memory deficits, and loss of white matter integrity, as measured by ultra&#xa0;high-field magnetic resonance&#xa0;diffusion tensor imaging. White matter astrogliosis was accompanied by activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kB in reactive astrocytes. Using mice expressing a dominant negative inhibitor of NF-kB under the control of the astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) promoter (GFAP-IkB&#x3b1;-dn), we found that transgenic inhibition of astroglial NF-kB signaling ameliorated gliosis and axonal loss, maintained white matter structural integrity, and preserved memory function. Collectively, our results imply that pro-inflammatory changes in white matter astrocytes may represent an important detrimental component in the pathogenesis of vascular cognitive impairment, and that targeting these pathways may lead to novel therapeutic strategies."
"The prognostic impact of TERT mutations has been controversial in IDH-wild tumors, particularly in glioblastomas (GBM). The controversy may be attributable to presence of potential confounding factors such as MGMT methylation status or patients' treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of TERT status on patient outcome in association with various factors in a large series of adult diffuse gliomas. We analyzed a total of 951 adult diffuse gliomas from two cohorts (Cohort 1, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;758; Cohort 2, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;193) for IDH1/2, 1p/19q, and TERT promoter status. The combined IDH/TERT classification divided Cohort 1 into four molecular groups with distinct outcomes. The overall survival (OS) was the shortest in IDH wild-type/TERT mutated groups, which mostly consisted of GBMs (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). To investigate the association between TERT mutations and MGMT methylation on survival of patients with GBM, samples from a combined cohort of 453 IDH-wild-type GBM cases treated with radiation and temozolomide were analyzed. A multivariate Cox regression model revealed that the interaction between TERT and MGMT was significant for OS (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0064). Compared with TERT mutant-MGMT unmethylated GBMs, the hazard ratio (HR) for OS incorporating the interaction was the lowest in the TERT mutant-MGMT methylated GBM (HR, 0.266), followed by the TERT wild-type-MGMT methylated (HR, 0.317) and the TERT wild-type-MGMT unmethylated GBMs (HR, 0.542). Thus, patients with TERT mutant-MGMT unmethylated GBM have the poorest prognosis. Our findings suggest that a combination of IDH, TERT, and MGMT refines the classification of grade II-IV diffuse gliomas."
"Decreased neuronal insulin receptor (IR) signaling in Alzheimer's disease is suggested to contribute to synaptic loss and neurodegeneration. This work shows that alteration of membrane microdomains increases IR levels and signaling, as well as neuronal viability in AD models in vitro and in vivo. Neuronal membrane microdomains are highly enriched in gangliosides. We found that inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), the key enzyme of ganglioside biosynthesis, increases viability of cortical neurons in 5xFAD mice, as well as in cultured neurons exposed to oligomeric amyloid-&#x3b2;-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs). We furthermore demonstrate a molecular mechanism explaining how gangliosides mediate ADDL-related toxic effects on IR of murine neurons. GCS inhibition increases the levels of functional dendritic IR on the neuronal surface by decreasing caveolin-1-mediated IR internalization. Consequently, IR signaling is increased in neurons exposed to ADDL stress. Thus, we propose that GCS inhibition constitutes a potential target for protecting neurons from ADDL-mediated neurotoxicity and insulin resistance in Alzheimer's disease."
"Disruptions to genes linked to RNA processing and homeostasis are implicated in the pathogenesis of two pathologically related but clinically heterogeneous neurodegenerative diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations in the Fused-in-Sarcoma (FUS) gene encoding a 526 amino-acid RNA-binding protein are found in a small subset of ALS cases, but FUS mutations do not appear to be a direct cause of FTD. Structural and functional similarities between FUS and another ALS-related RNA-binding protein, TDP-43, highlight the potential importance of aberrant RNA processing in ALS/FTD, and this pathway is now a major focus of interest. Recently, several research groups have reported transgenic vertebrate models of FUSopathy, with varying results. Here, we discuss the evidence for FUS pathogenicity in ALS/FTD, review the experimental approaches used and phenotypic features of FUS rodent models reported to date, and outline their contribution to our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms. Further refinement of vertebrate models will likely aid our understanding of the role of FUS in both diseases."
"Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is the most common spinal cord disorder and a major cause of disability in adults. Improvements following surgical decompression are limited and patients often remain severely disabled. Post mortem studies indicate that CSM is associated with profound axonal loss. However, our understanding of the pathophysiology of CSM remains limited.To investigate the hypothesis that axonal plasticity plays a role in the recovery following surgical decompression, we adopted a novel preclinical model of mild to moderate CSM. Spinal cord compression resulted in significant locomotor deterioration, increased expression of the axonal injury marker APP, and loss of serotonergic fibres. Surgical decompression partially reversed the deficits and attenuated APP expression. Decompression was also associated with axonal sprouting, reflected in the restoration of serotonergic fibres and an increase of GAP43 expression. The re-expression of synaptophysin indicated the restoration of functional synapses following decompression. Promoting axonal plasticity may therefore be a therapeutic strategy for promoting neurological recovery in CSM."
"Alzheimer's disease primarily occurs as sporadic disease and is accompanied with vast socio-economic problems. The mandatory basic research relies on robust and reliable disease models to overcome increasing incidence and emerging social challenges. Rodent models are most efficient, versatile, and predominantly used in research. However, only highly artificial and mostly genetically modified models are available. As these 'engineered' models reproduce only isolated features, researchers demand more suitable models of sporadic neurodegenerative diseases. One very promising animal model was the South American rodent Octodon degus, which was repeatedly described as natural 'sporadic Alzheimer's disease model' with 'Alzheimer's disease-like neuropathology'. To unveil advantages over the 'artificial' mouse models, we re-evaluated the age-dependent, neurohistological changes in young and aged Octodon degus (1 to 5-years-old) bred in a wild-type colony in Germany. In our hands, extensive neuropathological analyses of young and aged animals revealed normal age-related cortical changes without obvious signs for extensive degeneration as seen in patients with dementia. Neither significant neuronal loss nor enhanced microglial activation were observed in aged animals. Silver impregnation methods, conventional, and immunohistological stains as well as biochemical fractionations revealed neither amyloid accumulation nor tangle formation. Phosphoepitope-specific antibodies against tau species displayed similar intraneuronal reactivity in both, young and aged Octodon degus.In contrast to previous results, our study suggests that Octodon degus born and bred in captivity do not inevitably develop cortical amyloidosis, tangle formation or neuronal loss as seen in Alzheimer's disease patients or transgenic disease models."
Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders of the elderly and ageing hence described to be a major risk factor. Telomere shortening as a result of the inability to fully replicate the ends of linear chromosomes is one of the hallmarks of ageing. The role of telomere dysfunction in neurological diseases and the ageing brain is not clarified and there is an ongoing discussion whether telomere shortening is linked to Parkinson's disease. Here we studied a mouse model of Parkinson's disease (Thy-1 [A30P] &#x3b1;-synuclein transgenic mouse model) in the background of telomere shortening (Terc knockout mouse model). &#x3b1;-synuclein transgenic mice with short telomeres (&#x3b1;SYN(tg/tg) G3Terc(-/-)) developed an accelerated disease with significantly decreased survival. This accelerated phenotype of mice with short telomeres was characterized by a declined motor performance and an increased formation of &#x3b1;-synuclein aggregates. Immunohistochemical analysis and mRNA expression studies revealed that the disease end-stage brain stem microglia showed an impaired response in &#x3b1;SYN(tg/tg) G3Terc(-/-) microglia animals. These results provide the first experimental data that telomere shortening accelerates &#x3b1;-synuclein pathology that is linked to limited microglia function in the brainstem.
"Rare variation in TREM2 has been associated with greater risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). TREM2 encodes a cell surface receptor expressed on microglia and related cells, and the R47H variant associated with AD appears to affect the ability of TREM2 to bind extracellular ligands. In addition, other rare TREM2 mutations causing early-onset neurodegeneration are thought to impair cell surface expression. Using a sequence kernel association (SKAT) analysis in two independent AD cohorts, we found significant enrichment of rare TREM2 variants not previously characterized at the protein level. Heterologous expression of the identified variants showed that novel variants S31F and R47C displayed significantly reduced cell surface expression. In addition, we identified rare variant R136Q in a patient with language-predominant AD that also showed impaired surface expression. The results suggest rare TREM2 variants enriched in AD may be associated with altered TREM2 function and that AD risk may be conferred, in part, from altered TREM2 surface expression."
"Supercentenarians (aged 110&#xa0;years old or more) are extremely rare in the world population (the number of living supercentenarians is estimated as 47 in the world), and details about their neuropathological information are limited. Based on previous studies, centenarians (aged 100-109 years old) exhibit several types of neuropathological changes, such as Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body disease pathology, primary age-related tauopathy, TDP-43 pathology, and hippocampal sclerosis. In the present study, we provide results from neuropathological analyses of four supercentenarian autopsy cases using conventional and immunohistochemical analysis for neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, we focused on the pathology of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body disease, as well as the status of hippocampal sclerosis, TDP-43 pathology, aging-related tau astrogliopathy, and cerebrovascular diseases. Three cases were characterized as an ""intermediate"" level of Alzheimer's disease changes (NIA-AA guideline) and one was characterized as primary age-related tauopathy. TDP-43 deposits were present in the hippocampus in two cases. Neither Lewy body pathology nor hippocampal sclerosis was observed. Aging-related tau astrogliopathy was consistently observed, particularly in the basal forebrain. Small vessel diseases were also present, but they were relatively mild for cerebral amyloid-beta angiopathy and arteriolosclerosis. Although our study involved a small number of cases, the results provide a better understanding about human longevity. Neuropathological alterations associated with aging were mild to moderate in the supercentenarian brain, suggesting that these individuals might have some neuroprotective factors against aging. Future prospective studies and extensive molecular analyses are needed to determine the mechanisms of human longevity."
"The infiltrative behavior of diffuse gliomas severely reduces therapeutic potential of surgical resection and radiotherapy, and urges for the identification of new drug-targets affecting glioma growth and migration. To address the potential role of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), we performed mRNA expression profiling for 91 of the 109 known human PTP genes on a series of clinical diffuse glioma samples of different grades and compared our findings with in silico knowledge from REMBRANDT and TCGA databases. Overall PTP family expression levels appeared independent of characteristic genetic aberrations associated with lower grade or high grade gliomas. Notably, seven PTP genes (DUSP26, MTMR4, PTEN, PTPRM, PTPRN2, PTPRT and PTPRZ1) were differentially expressed between grade II-III gliomas and (grade IV) glioblastomas. For DUSP26, PTEN, PTPRM and PTPRT, lower expression levels correlated with poor prognosis, and overexpression of DUSP26 or PTPRT in E98 glioblastoma cells reduced tumorigenicity. Our study represents the first in-depth analysis of PTP family expression in diffuse glioma subtypes and warrants further investigations into PTP-dependent signaling events as new entry points for improved therapy."
"Homo and heterozygote cx3cr1 mutant mice, which harbor a green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in their cx3cr1 loci, represent a widely used animal model to study microglia and peripheral myeloid cells. Here we report that microglia in the dentate gyrus (DG) of cx3cr1 (-/-) mice displayed elevated microglial sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression levels and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) p65 activation, despite unaltered morphology when compared to cx3cr1 (+/-) or cx3cr1 (+/+) controls. This phenotype was restricted to the DG and accompanied by reduced adult neurogenesis in cx3cr1 (-/-) mice. Remarkably, adult neurogenesis was not affected by the lack of the CX3CR1-ligand, fractalkine (CX3CL1). Mechanistically, pharmacological activation of SIRT1 improved adult neurogenesis in the DG together with an enhanced performance of cx3cr1 (-/-) mice in a hippocampus-dependent learning and memory task. The reverse condition was induced when SIRT1 was inhibited in cx3cr1 (-/-) mice, causing reduced adult neurogenesis and lowered hippocampal cognitive abilities. In conclusion, our data indicate that deletion of CX3CR1 from microglia under resting conditions modifies brain areas with elevated cellular turnover independent of CX3CL1."
"Isolated generalized dystonia is a central motor network disorder characterized by twisted movements or postures. The most frequent genetic cause is a GAG deletion in the Tor1a (DYT1) gene encoding torsinA with a reduced penetrance of 30-40&#xa0;% suggesting additional genetic or environmental modifiers. Development of dystonia-like movements after a standardized peripheral nerve crush lesion in wild type (wt) and Tor1a+/- mice, that express 50&#xa0;% torsinA only, was assessed by scoring of hindlimb movements during tail suspension, by rotarod testing and by computer-assisted gait analysis. Western blot analysis was performed for dopamine transporter (DAT), D1 and D2 receptors from striatal and quantitative RT-PCR analysis for DAT from midbrain dissections. Autoradiography was used to assess the functional DAT binding in striatum. Striatal dopamine and its metabolites were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. After nerve crush injury, we found abnormal posturing in the lesioned hindlimb of both mutant and wt mice indicating the profound influence of the nerve lesion (15x vs. 12x relative to control) resembling human peripheral pseudodystonia. In mutant mice the phenotypic abnormalities were increased by about 40&#xa0;% (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). This was accompanied by complex alterations of striatal dopamine homeostasis. Pharmacological blockade of dopamine synthesis reduced severity of dystonia-like movements, whereas treatment with L-Dopa aggravated these but only in mutant mice suggesting a DYT1 related central component relevant to the development of abnormal involuntary movements. Our findings suggest that upon peripheral nerve injury reduced torsinA concentration and environmental stressors may act in concert in causing the central motor network dysfunction of DYT1 dystonia."
"In order to treat progressive paralysis in ALS patients, it is critical to develop a mouse that closely models human ALS in both pathology and also in the timing of these events. We have recently generated new TDP-43 bigenic mice (called rNLS8) with doxycycline (Dox)-suppressible expression of human TDP-43 (hTDP-43) harboring a defective nuclear localization signal (hTDP-43&#x2206;NLS) under the control of the NEFH promoter. Our previous studies characterized the pathology and disease course in young rNLS8 mice following induction of neuronal hTDP-43&#x394;NLS. We now seek to examine if the order and timing of pathologic events are changed in aged mice. We found that the expression of hTDP-43&#x2206;NLS in 12+ month old mice did not accelerate the appearance of neuromuscular abnormalities or motor neuron (MN) death in the lumbar spinal cord (SC), though disease progression was accelerated. However, following suppression of the transgene, important differences between young and aged rNLS8 mice emerged in functional motor recovery. We found that recovery was incomplete in aged mice relative to their younger treatment matched counterparts based on gross behavioral measures and physiological recordings from the animals' gastrocnemius&#xa0;(GC) muscles, despite muscle reinnervation by surviving MNs. This is likely because the reinnervation most often only resulted in partial nerve and endplate connections and the muscle's junctional folds were much more disorganized in aged rNLS8 mice. We believe that these studies will be an important basis for the future design and evaluation of therapies designed to slow denervation and promote re-innervation in adult ALS patients."
"In the present study, we performed a comprehensive analysis to clarify the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that had progressed to result in a totally locked-in state (communication Stage V), in which all voluntary movements are lost and communication is impossible. In 11 patients, six had phosphorylated TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (pTDP-43)-immunoreactive (ir) neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCI), two had fused in sarcoma (FUS)-ir NCI, and three had copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1)-ir NCI. The time from ALS onset to the need for tracheostomy invasive ventilation was less than 24&#xa0;months in ten patients. Regardless of accumulated protein, all the patients showed common lesions in the pallido-nigro-luysian system, brainstem reticular formation, and cerebellar efferent system, in addition to motor neurons. In patients with pTDP-43-ir NCI, patients with NCI in the hippocampal dentate granule neurons (DG) showed a neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex, and patients without NCI in DG showed a preserved cerebral cortex. By contrast, in patients with FUS-ir NCI, patients with NCI in DG showed a preserved cerebral cortex and patients without NCI in DG showed marked cerebral degeneration. The cerebral cortex of patients with SOD1-ir NCI was preserved. Together, these findings suggest that lesions of the cerebrum are probably not necessary for progression to Stage V. In conclusion, patients with ALS that had progressed to result in communication Stage V showed rapidly-progressed symptoms, and their common lesions could cause the manifestations of communication Stage V."
"Several species of &#x3b2;-amyloid peptides (A&#x3b2;) exist as a result of differential cleavage from amyloid precursor protein (APP) to yield various C-terminal A&#x3b2; peptides. Several N-terminal modified A&#x3b2; peptides have also been identified in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains, the most common of which is pyroglutamate-modified A&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;<sub>pE3-42</sub>). A&#x3b2;<sub>pE3-42</sub> peptide has an increased propensity to aggregate, appears to accumulate in the brain before the appearance of clinical symptoms of AD, and precedes A&#x3b2;<sub>1-42</sub> deposition. Moreover, in vitro studies have shown that A&#x3b2;<sub>pE3-42</sub> can act as a seed for full length A&#x3b2;<sub>1-42.</sub> In this study, we characterized the Drosophila model of A&#x3b2;<sub>pE3-42</sub> toxicity by expressing the peptide in specific sets of neurons using the GAL4-UAS system, and measuring different phenotypic outcomes. We found that A&#x3b2;<sub>pE3-42</sub> peptide had an increased propensity to aggregate. Expression of A&#x3b2;<sub>pE3-42</sub> in the neurons of adult flies led to behavioural dysfunction and shortened lifespan. Expression of A&#x3b2;<sub>pE3-42</sub> constitutively in the eyes led to disorganised ommatidia, and activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. The eye disruption was almost completely rescued by co-expressing a candidate A&#x3b2; degrading enzyme, neprilysin2. Furthermore, we found that neprilysin2 was capable of degrading A&#x3b2;<sub>pE3-42.</sub> Also, we tested the seeding hypothesis for A&#x3b2;<sub>pE3-42</sub> in vivo, and measured its effect on A&#x3b2;<sub>1-42</sub> levels. We found that A&#x3b2;<sub>1-42</sub> levels were significantly increased when A&#x3b2;<sub>1-42</sub> and A&#x3b2;<sub>pE3-42</sub> peptides were co-expressed. Furthermore, we found that A&#x3b2;<sub>pE3-42</sub> enhanced A&#x3b2;<sub>1-42</sub> toxicity in vivo. Our findings implicate A&#x3b2;<sub>pE3-42</sub> as an important source of toxicity in AD, and suggest that its specific degradation could be therapeutic."
"Substantial data indicate that amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;), the major component of senile plaques, plays a central role in Alzheimer's Disease and indeed the assembly of naturally occurring amyloid peptides into cytotoxic aggregates is linked to the disease pathogenesis. Although A&#x3b2;42 is a highly aggregating form of A&#x3b2;, the co-occurrence of shorter A&#x3b2; peptides might affect the aggregation potential of the A&#x3b2; pool. In this study we aimed to assess whether the structural behavior of human A&#x3b2;42 peptide inside the brain is influenced by the concomitant presence of N-terminal fragments produced by the proteolytic activity of glial cells. We show that the occurrence of the human C-terminal truncated 1-24 A&#x3b2; fragment impairs A&#x3b2;42 clearance through blood brain barrier and promotes the formation of A&#x3b2;42 aggregates even in the healthy brain. By showing that A&#x3b2;1-24 has seeding properties for aggregate formation in intracranially injected wild type mice, our study provide the proof-of-concept that peptides produced upon A&#x3b2;42 cleavage by activated glial cells may cause phenotypic defects even in the absence of genetic mutations associated with Alzheimer's Disease, possibly contributing to the development of the sporadic form of the pathology."
"Concomitant deposition of amyloid -beta protein (A&#x3b2;) and neuronal tau as neurofibrillary tangles in the human brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). Because these deposits increase during normal aging, it has been proposed that aging brains may also undergo AD-like changes. To investigate the neuropathological changes that occur in the aging primate brain, we examined 21 brains of cynomolgus monkeys (7-36 years old) for A&#x3b2;- and tau-positive lesions. We found, 1) extensive deposition of A&#x3b2; in brains of cynomolgus monkeys over 25&#xa0;years of age, 2) selective deposition of 4-repeat tau as pretangles in neurons, and as coiled body-like structures in oligodendroglia-like cells and astrocytes, 3) preferential distribution of tau in the basal ganglia and neocortex rather than the hippocampus, and 4) age-associated increases in 30-34&#xa0;kDa AT8- and RD4-positive tau fragments in sarkosyl-insoluble fractions. We further labeled tau-positive structures using diaminobezidine enhanced with nickel, and visualized nickel-labeled structures by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of ultrathin sections. This allowed us to distinguish between nickel-labeled tau and background electron-dense structures, and we found that tau localized to 20-25&#xa0;nm straight filaments in oligodendroglia-like cells and neurons. Our results indicate that the cytopathology and distribution of tau deposits in aged cynomolgus brains resemble those of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) rather than AD. Thus, even in the presence of A&#x3b2;, age-associated deposition of tau in non-human primates likely does not occur through AD-associated mechanisms."
"A given cell makes exchanges with its neighbors through a variety of means ranging from diffusible factors to vesicles. Cells use also tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), filamentous-actin-containing membranous structures that bridge and connect cells. First described in immune cells, TNTs facilitate HIV-1 transfer and are found in various cell types, including neurons. We show that the microtubule-associated protein Tau, a key player in Alzheimer's disease, is a bona fide constituent of TNTs. This is important because Tau appears beside filamentous actin and myosin 10 as a specific marker of these fine protrusions of membranes and cytosol that are difficult to visualize. Furthermore, we observed that exogenous Tau species increase the number of TNTs established between primary neurons, thereby facilitating the intercellular transfer of Tau fibrils. In conclusion, Tau may contribute to the formation and function of the highly dynamic TNTs that may be involved in the prion-like propagation of Tau assemblies."
"Cerebrovascular (CV) dysfunction is emerging as a critical component of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including altered CV coverage. Angiogenic growth factors (AGFs) are key for controlling CV coverage, especially during disease pathology. Therefore, evaluating the effects of AGFs in vivo can provide important information on the role of CV coverage in AD. We recently demonstrated that epidermal growth factor (EGF) prevents amyloid-beta (A&#x3b2;)-induced damage to brain endothelial cells in vitro. Here, our goal was to assess the protective effects of EGF on cognition, CV coverage and A&#x3b2; levels using an AD-Tg model that incorporates CV relevant AD risk factors. APOE4 is the greatest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD especially in women and is associated with CV dysfunction. EFAD mice express human APOE3 (E3FAD) or APOE4 (E4FAD), overproduce human A&#x3b2;42 and are a well characterized model of APOE pathology. Thus, initially the role of APOE and sex in cognitive and CV dysfunction was assessed in EFAD mice in order to identify a group for EGF treatment. At 8&#xa0;months E4FAD female mice were cognitively impaired, had low CV coverage, high microbleeds and low plasma EGF levels. Therefore, E4FAD female mice were selected for an EGF prevention paradigm (300&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/kg/wk, 6 to 8.5&#xa0;months). EGF prevented cognitive decline and was associated with lower microbleeds and higher CV coverage, but not changes in A&#x3b2; levels. Collectively, these data suggest that EGF can prevent A&#x3b2;-induced damage to the CV. Developing therapeutic strategies based on AGFs may be particularly efficacious for APOE4-induced AD risk."
"The objective of this study is to determine if the nerve pathology in patients with POEMS syndrome is different from CIDP. We hypothesized that nerve biopsies from patients with POEMS syndrome would have more small vessels and axonal degeneration but less inflammation than CIDP.We performed a retrospective analysis of nerve biopsies performed on ""classic"" CIDP and POEMS cases. Nerve biopsies were blinded and reviewed by two of the authors (EAP, PJBD). Teased fibers, paraffin-embedded sections, semithin sections and immunostains were analyzed. Small endoneurial and epineurial vessels were counted on paraffin sections with smooth muscle actin (SMACTIN) preparation to judge for neovascularization.A total of 61 cases (35-POEMS, 26-CIDP) were included. The POEMS-group had significantly higher axonal degeneration and fewer normal myelinated fibers on teased fiber preparations. The CIDP-group had significantly more endoneurial mononuclear inflammation on paraffin sections and immunostains. Large onion-bulbs were present only in CIDP cases. A significantly higher number of epineurial vessels was present in POEMS biopsies, with a total count of 120 epineurial vessels predicted as best cutoff to differentiate both conditions (77&#xa0;% specific and 54&#xa0;% sensitive).In conclusion, nerve biopsy can be helpful in distinguishing POEMS syndrome from CIDP. POEMS syndrome demonstrates more axonal degeneration and epineurial neovascularization whereas CIDP has greater endoneurial inflammation and onion-bulb formation. These findings support the idea that there are differing underlying mechanisms for these disorders, POEMS being related to paraneoplastic vasculopathy associated with angiogenic factors and CIDP related to inflammatory demyelination."
"Loss of intracellular compartmentalization of potassium is a biochemical feature of Alzheimer's disease indicating a loss of membrane integrity and mitochondrial dysfunction. We examined potassium and rubidium (a biological proxy for potassium) in brain tissue, blood fractions and cerebrospinal fluid from Alzheimer's disease and healthy control subjects to investigate the diagnostic potential of these two metal ions. We found that both potassium and rubidium levels were significantly decreased across all intracellular compartments in the Alzheimer's disease brain. Serum from over 1000 participants in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL), showed minor changes according to disease state. Potassium and rubidium levels in erythrocytes and cerebrospinal fluid were not significantly different according to disease state, and rubidium was slightly decreased in Alzheimer's disease patients compared to healthy controls. Our data provides evidence that contrasts the hypothesized disruption of the blood-brain barrier in Alzheimer's disease, with the systemic decrease in cortical potassium and rubidium levels suggesting influx of ions from the blood is minimal and that the observed changes are more likely indicative of an internal energy crisis within the brain. These findings may be the basis for potential diagnostic imaging studies using radioactive potassium and rubidium tracers."
"Postural instability and supranuclear gaze palsy represent the key symptoms of Richardson's syndrome, the most frequent clinical manifestation of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). However, a proportion of PSP patients never develops ocular motor symptoms, which prevents clinicians from establishing the diagnosis during lifetime according to current diagnostic criteria. We present one instructive autopsy-confirmed PSP case with prospective video-documented clinical course, showing striking temporal divergence of initially present postural instability and delayed development of ocular motor dysfunction. Brain imaging and autopsy findings were typical of PSP, but the temporal sequence of symptoms was unusual with isolated postural instability predominating the clinical course for many years and slowing of vertical saccades/supranuclear gaze palsy evolving not until the 9<sup>th</sup>/11<sup>th</sup> year after disease onset. Although other differential diagnoses were unlikely, this patient did not pass the threshold for possible or probable diagnosis of PSP according to current diagnostic criteria until very late in the disease course. This first well documented, autopsy confirmed case of PSP with predominant postural instability further expands the clinical spectrum of PSP and points out the need of new clinical diagnostic criteria with sufficient sensitivity and specificity for an early and reliable diagnosis."
"Ryanodine receptor isoform-1 (RyR1) is a major calcium channel in skeletal muscle important for excitation-contraction coupling. Mutations in the RYR1 gene yield RyR1 protein dysfunction that manifests clinically as RYR1-related congenital myopathies (RYR1-RM) and/or malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS). Individuals with RYR1-RM and/or MHS exhibit varying symptoms and severity. The symptoms impair quality of life and put patients at risk for early mortality, yet the cause of varying severity is not well understood. Currently, there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatment for RYR1-RM. Discovery of effective treatments is therefore critical, requiring knowledge of the RyR1 pathway. The purpose of this review is to compile work published to date on the RyR1 pathway and to implicate potential regions as targets for treatment. The RyR1 pathway is comprised of protein-protein interactions, protein-ligand interactions, and post-translational modifications, creating an activation/regulatory macromolecular complex. Given the complexity of this pathway, we divided these interactions and modifications into six regulatory groups. Three of several RyR1 interacting proteins, FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12), triadin, and calmodulin, were identified as playing important roles across all groups and may serve as promising target sites for treatment. Also, variability in disease severity may be influenced by prolongation or hyperactivity of post-translational modifications resulting from RyR1 dysfunction."
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of upper and lower motor neurons. Mutations in the gene encoding the nuclear matrix protein Matrin 3 have been found in familial cases of ALS, as well as autosomal dominant distal myopathy with vocal cord and pharyngeal weakness. We previously found that spinal cord and muscle, organs involved in either ALS or distal myopathy, have relatively lower levels of Matrin 3 compared to the brain and other peripheral organs in the murine system. This suggests that these organs may be vulnerable to any changes in Matrin 3. In order to determine the role of Matrin 3 in these diseases, we created a transgenic mouse model for human wild-type Matrin 3 using the mouse prion promoter (MoPrP) on a FVB background.We identified three founder transgenic lines that produced offspring in which mice developed either hindlimb paresis or paralysis with hindlimb and forelimb muscle atrophy. Muscles of affected mice showed a striking increase in nuclear Matrin 3, as well as the presence of rounded fibers, vacuoles, nuclear chains, and subsarcolemmal nuclei. Immunoblot analysis of the gastrocnemius muscle from phenotypic mice showed increased levels of Matrin 3 products migrating at approximately 120 (doublet), 90, 70, and 55&#xa0;kDa. While there was no significant change in the levels of Matrin 3 in the spinal cord in the phenotypic mice, the ventral horn contained individual cells with cytoplasmic redistribution of Matrin 3, as well as gliosis. The phenotypes of these mice indicate that dysregulation of Matrin 3 levels is deleterious to neuromuscular function."
"Classified as benign central nervous system (CNS) tumors, pituitary adenomas account for 10% of diagnosed intracranial neoplasms. Although surgery is often curative, patients with invasive macroadenomas continue to experience significant morbidity and are prone to tumor recurrence. Given the identification of human brain tumor-initiating cells (TICs) that initiate and maintain tumor growth while promoting disease progression and relapse in multiple CNS tumors, we investigated whether TICs also drive the growth of human pituitary adenomas. Using a nanoString-based 80-gene custom codeset specific for developmental pathways, we identified a differential stem cell gene expression profile within human pituitary adenomas. Prospective functional characterization of stem cell properties in patient-derived adenomas representing all hormonal subtypes yielded a subtype-dependent self-renewal profile, which was enriched within the CD15+ cell fraction. The tumor-initiating capacity of CD15<sup>high</sup> adenoma cells was assayed in comparison to CD15<sup>low</sup> adenomas using in vivo limiting dilutions, which maintained the rare frequency of TICs. Repeated analyses using sorted cell populations for CD15+ TICs compared to CD15- adenoma cells provided further evidence of xenograft tumor formation to support CD15+ cells as putative pituitary adenoma-initiating cells (PAICs). The clinical utility of our findings was established through in silico analyses and comparative gene expression profiling of primary and recurrent pituitary adenomas. CD15 was enriched in recurrent adenomas, which was validated using routine clinical immunohistochemistry in a limited number of samples. Our work reports the first prospective identification of human PAICs using CD15. Patients with CD15<sup>high</sup> adenomas may therefore benefit from more aggressive surgical interventions and chemo/radiotherapy."
"The over-production of &#x3b2;-amyloid (A&#x3b2;) has been strongly correlated to neuronal dysfunction and altered synaptic plasticity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accordingly, it has been proposed that disrupted synaptic transmission and neuronal network instability underlie memory failure that is evident in the early phases of AD. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) serves to restrain neuronal activity within a physiological range. Therefore a disruption of this mechanism may lead to destabilization in synaptic and neural circuit function. Here, we report that during HSP by neuronal activity deprivation, application of A&#x3b2; results in an aberrant over-response of the up-regulation of AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated synaptic currents and cell-surface AMPAR expression. In the visual cortex, in vivo HSP induced by visual deprivation shows a similar over-response following an A&#x3b2; local injection. A&#x3b2; increases the expression of GluA2-lacking, calcium permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs), which are required for the initiation, but not maintenance of HSP. Both GluA2-lacking and GluA2-containing AMPARs contribute to the A&#x3b2;-mediated over-scaling of HSP. We also find that A&#x3b2; induces the dissociation of HDAC1 from the miR124 transcription factor EVI1, leading to an up-regulation of miR124 expression and increased amount of CP-AMPARs. Thus, via aberrant stimulation of miR124 expression and biogenesis of CP-AMPARs, A&#x3b2; is able to induce an over response in HSP. This A&#x3b2;-mediated dysregulation in homeostatic plasticity may play an important role in the pathogenesis of altered neural function and memory deficits in the early stages of AD."
"&#x3b1;-synuclein (aSyn) is associated with both sporadic and familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. In particular, multiplications and point mutations in the gene encoding for aSyn cause familial forms of PD. Moreover, the accumulation of aSyn in Lewy Bodies and Lewy neurites in disorders such as PD, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy, suggests aSyn misfolding and aggregation plays an important role in these disorders, collectively known as synucleinopathies. The exact function of aSyn remains unclear, but it is known to be associated with vesicles and membranes, and to have an impact on important cellular functions such as intracellular trafficking and protein degradation systems, leading to cellular pathologies that can be readily studied in cell-based models. Thus, understanding the molecular effects of aSyn point mutations may provide important insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying disease onset.We investigated the effect of the recently identified A53E aSyn mutation. Combining in vitro studies with studies in cell models, we found that this mutation reduces aSyn aggregation and increases proteasome activity, altering normal proteostasis.We observed that, in our experimental paradigms, the A53E mutation affects specific steps of the aggregation process of aSyn and different cellular processes, providing novel ideas about the molecular mechanisms involved in synucleinopathies."
"Neuropathological and genetic findings suggest that the presynaptic protein &#x3b1;-synuclein (aSyn) is involved in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathy disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy. Evidence suggests that the self-assembly of aSyn conformers bound to phospholipid membranes in an aggregation-prone state plays a key role in aSyn neurotoxicity. Accordingly, we hypothesized that protein binding partners of lipid-associated aSyn could inhibit the formation of toxic aSyn oligomers at membrane surfaces. To address this hypothesis, we characterized the protein endosulfine-alpha (ENSA), previously shown to interact selectively with membrane-bound aSyn, in terms of its effects on the membrane-induced aggregation and neurotoxicity of two familial aSyn mutants, A30P and G51D. We found that wild-type ENSA, but not the non-aSyn-binding S109E variant, interfered with membrane-induced aSyn self-assembly, aSyn-mediated vesicle disruption and aSyn neurotoxicity. Immunoblotting analyses revealed that ENSA was down-regulated in the brains of synucleinopathy patients versus non-diseased individuals. Collectively, these results suggest that ENSA can alleviate neurotoxic effects of membrane-bound aSyn via an apparent chaperone-like activity at the membrane surface, and a decrease in ENSA expression may contribute to aSyn neuropathology in synucleinopathy disorders. More generally, our findings suggest that promoting interactions between lipid-bound, amyloidogenic proteins and their binding partners is a viable strategy to alleviate cytotoxicity in a range of protein misfolding disorders."
"Mitochondria play a key role in common neurodegenerative diseases and contain their own genome: mtDNA. Common inherited polymorphic variants of mtDNA have been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, and somatic deletions of mtDNA have been found in affected brain regions. However, there are conflicting reports describing the role of rare inherited variants and somatic point mutations in neurodegenerative disorders, and recent evidence also implicates mtDNA levels. To address these issues we studied 1363 post mortem human brains with a histopathological diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Frontotemporal dementia - Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (FTD-ALS), Creutzfeldt Jacob disease (CJD), and healthy controls. We obtained high-depth whole mitochondrial genome sequences using off target reads from whole exome sequencing to determine the association of mtDNA variation with the development and progression of disease, and to better understand the development of mtDNA mutations and copy number in the aging brain. With this approach, we found a surprisingly high frequency of heteroplasmic mtDNA variants in 32.3% of subjects. However, we found no evidence of an association between rare inherited variants of mtDNA or mtDNA heteroplasmy and disease. In contrast, we observed a reduction in the amount of mtDNA copy in both AD and CJD. Based on these findings, single nucleotide variants of mtDNA are unlikely to play a major role in the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative diseases, but mtDNA levels merit further investigation."
"The role of resident microglial cells in the pathogenesis and progression of glial tumors is still obscure mainly due to a lack of specific markers. Recently P2RY12, a P2 purinergic receptor, was introduced as a specific marker for microglial cells under normal and pathologic conditions. Here we analyzed the expression of P2RY12 in astrocytomas of various malignancy grades in relation to markers for M1 and M2 macrophage activation profiles by using two web-based glioma datasets and confocal immunohistochemistry to 28 astrocytoma samples grades II-IV. In the gliomas, P2RY12 immunoreactivity delineated CD68 negative cells with otherwise microglial features from CD68 positive tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). The presence of P2RY12 positive cells correlated positively with overall survival. P2RY12 mRNA levels and membrane-bound localization of P2RY12 were inversely correlated with increasing malignancy grade, and the expression site of P2RY12 shifted from cytoplasmic in low-grade gliomas, to nuclear in high-grade tumors. The cytoplasmic expression of P2RY12 was associated with the expression of M1 markers, characteristic of the pro-inflammatory macrophage response. In contrast, the nuclear localization of P2RY12 was predominant in the higher graded tumors and associated with the expression of the M2 marker CD163.We conclude that P2RY12 is a specific marker for resident microglia in glioma and its expression and localization correspond to tumor grade and predominant stage of M1/M2 immune response."
"The small heat shock protein HSPB1 (Hsp27) is an ubiquitously expressed molecular chaperone able to regulate various cellular functions like actin dynamics, oxidative stress regulation and anti-apoptosis. So far disease causing mutations in HSPB1 have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as distal hereditary motor neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Most mutations in HSPB1 target its highly conserved &#x3b1;-crystallin domain, while other mutations affect the C- or N-terminal regions or its promotor. Mutations inside the &#x3b1;-crystallin domain have been shown to enhance the chaperone activity of HSPB1 and increase the binding to client proteins. However, the HSPB1-P182L mutation, located outside and downstream of the &#x3b1;-crystallin domain, behaves differently. This specific HSPB1 mutation results in a severe neuropathy phenotype affecting exclusively the motor neurons of the peripheral nervous system. We identified that the HSPB1-P182L mutant protein has a specifically increased interaction with the RNA binding protein poly(C)binding protein 1 (PCBP1) and results in a reduction of its translational repressive activity. RNA immunoprecipitation followed by RNA sequencing on mouse brain lead to the identification of PCBP1 mRNA targets. These targets contain larger 3'- and 5'-UTRs than average and are enriched in an RNA motif consisting of the CTCCTCCTCCTCC consensus sequence. Interestingly, next to the clear presence of neuronal transcripts among the identified PCBP1 targets we identified known genes associated with hereditary peripheral neuropathies and hereditary spastic paraplegias. We therefore conclude that HSPB1 can mediate translational repression through interaction with an RNA binding protein further supporting its role in neurodegenerative disease."
"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the pathological accumulation of alpha-synuclein (&#x3b1;-syn) in oligodendrocytes. Therapeutic efforts to stop or delay the progression of MSA have yielded suboptimal results in clinical trials, and there are no efficient treatments currently available for MSA patients. We hypothesize that combining therapies targeting different aspects of the disease may lead to better clinical outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we combined the use of a single-chain antibody targeting &#x3b1;-syn modified for improved central nervous system penetration (CD5-D5) with an unconventional anti-inflammatory treatment (lenalidomide) in the myelin basic protein (MBP)-&#x3b1;-syn transgenic mouse model of MSA. While the use of either CD5-D5 or lenalidomide alone had positive effects on neuroinflammation and/or &#x3b1;-syn accumulation in this mouse model of MSA, the combination of both approaches yielded better results than each single treatment. The combined treatment reduced astrogliosis, microgliosis, soluble and aggregated &#x3b1;-syn levels, and partially improved behavioral deficits in MBP-&#x3b1;-syn transgenic mice. These effects were associated with an activation of the Akt signaling pathway, which may mediate cytoprotective effects downstream tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x3b1;). These results suggest that a strategic combination of treatments may improve the therapeutic outcome in trials for MSA and related neurodegenerative disorders."
"Neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), PD dementia (PDD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are characterized by progressive accumulation of &#x3b1;-synuclein (&#x3b1;-syn) in neurons. Recent studies have proposed that neuron-to-neuron propagation of &#x3b1;-syn plays a role in the pathogenesis of these disorders. We have previously shown that antibodies against the C-terminus of &#x3b1;-syn reduce the intra-neuronal accumulation of &#x3b1;-syn and related deficits in transgenic models of synucleinopathy, probably by abrogating the axonal transport and accumulation of &#x3b1;-syn in in vivo models. Here, we assessed the effect of passive immunization against &#x3b1;-syn in a new mouse model of axonal transport and accumulation of &#x3b1;-syn. For these purpose, non-transgenic, &#x3b1;-syn knock-out and mThy1-&#x3b1;-syn tg (line 61) mice received unilateral intra-cerebral injections with a lentiviral (LV)-&#x3b1;-syn vector construct followed by systemic administration of the monoclonal antibody 1H7 (recognizes amino acids 91-99) or control IgG for 3&#xa0;months. Cerebral &#x3b1;-syn accumulation and axonopathy was assessed by immunohistochemistry and effects on behavior were assessed by Morris water maze. Unilateral LV-&#x3b1;-syn injection resulted in axonal propagation of &#x3b1;-syn in the contra-lateral site with subsequent behavioral deficits and axonal degeneration. Passive immunization with 1H7 antibody reduced the axonal accumulation of &#x3b1;-syn in the contra-lateral side and ameliorated the behavioral deficits. Together this study supports the notion that immunotherapy might improve the deficits in models of synucleinopathy by reducing the axonal propagation and accumulation of &#x3b1;-syn. This represents a potential new mode of action through which &#x3b1;-syn immunization might work."
"Mutations resulting in haploinsufficiency of progranulin (PGRN) cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43-positive inclusions (FTLD-TDP), a devastating neurodegenerative disease. Accumulating evidence suggest a crucial role of progranulin in maintaining proper lysosomal function during aging. TMEM106B has been identified as a risk factor for &#xfeff;frontotemporal lobar degeneration &#xfeff;with progranulin mutations and elevated mRNA and protein levels of TMEM106B are associated with increased risk for frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Increased levels of TMEM106B alter lysosomal morphology and interfere with lysosomal degradation. However, how progranulin and TMEM106B interact to regulate lysosomal function and frontotemporal lobar degeneration&#xfeff; (FTLD) disease progression is still unclear. Here we report that progranulin deficiency leads to increased TMEM106B protein levels in the mouse cortex with aging. To mimic elevated levels of TMEM106B in frontotemporal lobar degeneration&#xfeff; (FTLD) cases, we generated transgenic mice expressing TMEM106B under the neuronal specific promoter, CamKII. Surprisingly, we found that the total protein levels of TMEM106B are not altered despite the expression of the TMEM106B transgene at mRNA and protein levels, suggesting a tight regulation of TMEM106B protein levels in the mouse brain. However, progranulin deficiency results in accumulation of TMEM106B protein from the transgene expression during aging, which is accompanied by exaggerated lysosomal abnormalities and increased lipofuscin accumulation. In summary, our mouse model nicely recapitulates the interaction between progranulin and TMEM106B in human patients and supports a critical role of lysosomal dysfunction in the frontotemporal lobar degeneration&#xfeff; (FTLD) disease progression."
"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are attractive molecules to utilize as one of the blood-based biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) because miRNAs are relatively stable in biofluid, including serum or plasma. To determine blood miRNA biomarkers for AD with next-generation sequencing genome-wide, we first surveyed 45 serum samples. These came from 27 AD patients and 18 controls (discovery set) that underwent autopsy within two weeks after their serum sampling and were neuropathologically diagnosed. We found that three miRNAs, hsa-miR-501-3p, hsa-let-7f-5p, and hsa-miR-26b-5p, were significantly deregulated between the AD samples and the controls. The deregulation for hsa-miR-501-3p was further confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a validation set composed of 36 clinically diagnosed AD patients and 22 age-matched cognitively normal controls with a sensitivity and specificity of 53% and 100%, respectively (area under the curve&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.82). Serum hsa-miR-501-3p levels were downregulated in AD patients, and its lower levels significantly correlated with lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Contrary to its serum levels, we found that hsa-miR-501-3p was remarkably upregulated in the same donors' AD brains obtained at autopsy from the discovery set. The hsa-miR-501-3p overexpression in cultured cells, which mimicked the hsa-miR-501-3p upregulation in the AD brains, induced significant downregulation of 128 genes that overrepresented the Gene Ontology terms, DNA replication, and the mitotic cell cycle. Our results suggest that hsa-miR-501-3p is a novel serum biomarker that presumably corresponds to pathological events occurring in AD brains."
"Axonal dystrophies (AxDs) are swollen and tortuous neuronal processes that are associated with extracellular depositions of amyloid &#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) and have been observed to contribute to synaptic alterations occurring in Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the temporal course of this axonal pathology is of high relevance to comprehend the progression of the disease over time. We performed a long-term in vivo study (up to 210&#xa0;days of two-photon imaging) with two transgenic mouse models (dE9xGFP-M and APP-PS1xGFP-M). Interestingly, AxDs were formed only in a quarter of GFP-expressing axons near A&#x3b2;-plaques, which indicates a selective vulnerability. AxDs, especially those reaching larger sizes, had long lifetimes and appeared as highly plastic structures with large variations in size and shape and axonal sprouting over time. In the case of the APP-PS1 mouse only, the formation of new long axonal segments in dystrophic axons (re-growth phenomenon) was observed. Moreover, new AxDs could appear at the same point of the axon where a previous AxD had been located before disappearance (re-formation phenomenon). In addition, we observed that most AxDs were formed and developed during the imaging period, and numerous AxDs had already disappeared by the end of this time. This work is the first in vivo study analyzing quantitatively the high plasticity of the axonal pathology around A&#x3b2; plaques. We hypothesized that a therapeutically early prevention of A&#x3b2; plaque formation or their growth might halt disease progression and promote functional axon regeneration and the recovery of neural circuits."
"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (herein called NMO) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system in which pathogenesis involves complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) produced by immunoglobulin G autoantibodies targeting aquaporin-4 (AQP4-IgG) on astrocytes. We reported evidence previously, using CD59<sup>-/-</sup> mice, that the membrane-associated complement inhibitor CD59 modulates CDC in NMO (Zhang and Verkman, J. Autoimmun. 53:67-77, 2014). Motivated by the observation that rats, unlike mice, have human-like complement activity, here we generated CD59<sup>-/-</sup> rats to investigate the role of CD59 in NMO and to create NMO pathology by passive transfer of AQP4-IgG under conditions in which minimal pathology is produced in normal rats. CD59<sup>-/-</sup> rats generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology showed no overt phenotype at baseline except for mild hemolysis. CDC assays in astrocyte cultures and cerebellar slices from CD59<sup>-/-</sup> rats showed much greater sensitivity to AQP4-IgG and complement than those from CD59<sup>+/+</sup> rats. Intracerebral administration of AQP4-IgG in CD59<sup>-/-</sup> rats produced marked NMO pathology, with astrocytopathy, inflammation, deposition of activated complement, and demyelination, whereas identically treated CD59<sup>+/+</sup> rats showed minimal pathology. A single, intracisternal injection of AQP4-IgG in CD59<sup>-/-</sup> rats produced hindlimb paralysis by 3&#xa0;days, with inflammation and deposition of activated complement in spinal cord, optic nerves and brain periventricular and surface matter, with most marked astrocyte injury in cervical spinal cord. These results implicate an important role of CD59 in modulating NMO pathology in rats and demonstrate amplification of AQP4-IgG-induced NMO disease with CD59 knockout."
"We previously reported transcriptional repression-induced atypical cell death of neuron (TRIAD), a new type of necrosis that is mainly regulated by Hippo pathway signaling and distinct from necroptosis regulated by RIP1/3 pathway. Here, we examined the ultrastructural and biochemical features of neuronal cell death in the brains of human HD patients in parallel with the similar analyses using mutant Htt-knock-in (Htt-KI) mice. LATS1 kinase, the critical regulator and marker of TRIAD, is actually activated in cortical neurons of postmortem human HD and of Htt-KI mouse brains, while apoptosis promoter kinase Plk1 was inactivated in human HD brains. Expression levels of YAP/YAPdeltaC were decreased in cortical neurons of human HD brains. Ultra-structural analyses revealed extreme enlargement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which characterizes TRIAD, in cortical neurons of human HD and those of Htt-KI mice. These biochemical and morphological results support that TRIAD occurs in human and mouse neurons under the HD pathology."
"We previously demonstrated that transplantation of murine neural stem cells (NSCs) can improve motor and cognitive function in a transgenic model of Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). These benefits occurred without changes in human &#x3b1;-synuclein pathology and were mediated in part by stem cell-induced elevation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). However, instrastriatal NSC transplantation likely alters the brain microenvironment via multiple mechanisms that may synergize to promote cognitive and motor recovery. The underlying neurobiology that mediates such restoration no doubt involves numerous genes acting in concert to modulate signaling within and between host brain cells and transplanted NSCs. In order to identify functionally connected gene networks and additional mechanisms that may contribute to stem cell-induced benefits, we performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on striatal tissue isolated from NSC- and vehicle-injected wild-type and DLB mice. Combining continuous behavioral and biochemical data with genome wide expression via network analysis proved to be a powerful approach; revealing significant alterations in immune response, neurotransmission, and mitochondria function. Taken together, these data shed further light on the gene network and biological processes that underlie the therapeutic effects of NSC transplantation on &#x3b1;-synuclein induced cognitive and motor impairments, thereby highlighting additional therapeutic targets for synucleinopathies."
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that lacks a predictive and broadly applicable biomarker. Continued focus on mutation-specific upstream mechanisms has yet to predict disease progression in the clinic. Utilising cellular pathology common to the majority of ALS patients, we implemented an objective transcriptome-driven approach to develop noninvasive prognostic biomarkers for disease progression. Genes expressed in laser captured motor neurons in direct correlation (Spearman rank correlation, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) with counts of neuropathology were developed into co-expression network modules. Screening modules using three gene sets representing rate of disease progression and upstream genetic association with ALS led to the prioritisation of a single module enriched for immune response to motor neuron degeneration. Genes in the network module are important for microglial activation and predict disease progression in genetically heterogeneous ALS cohorts: Expression of three genes in peripheral lymphocytes - LILRA2, ITGB2 and CEBPD - differentiate patients with rapid and slowly progressive disease, suggesting promise as a blood-derived biomarker. TREM2 is a member of the network module and the level of soluble TREM2 protein in cerebrospinal fluid is shown to predict survival when measured in late stage disease (Spearman rank correlation, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). Our data-driven systems approach has, for the first time, directly linked microglia to the development of motor neuron pathology. LILRA2, ITGB2 and CEBPD represent peripherally accessible candidate biomarkers and TREM2 provides a broadly applicable therapeutic target for ALS."
"Intrathecal immunoglobulin G (IgG) synthesis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oligoclonal IgG bands and lesional IgG deposition are seminal features of multiple sclerosis (MS) disease pathology. Both the specific targets and pathogenic effects of MS antibodies remain poorly characterized. We produced IgG1 monoclonal recombinant antibodies (rAbs) from clonally-expanded plasmablasts recovered from MS patient CSF. Among these were a subset of myelin-specific MS rAbs. We examined their immunoreactivity to mouse organotypic cerebellar slices by live binding and evaluated tissue injury in the presence and absence of human complement. Demyelination, glial and neuronal viability, and complement pathway activation were assayed by immunofluorescence microscopy and compared to the effects of an aquaporin-4 water channel (AQP4)-specific rAb derived from a neuromyelitis optica (NMO) patient. MS myelin-specific rAbs bound to discrete surface domains on oligodendrocyte processes and myelinating axons. Myelin-specific MS rAbs initiated complement-dependent cytotoxicity to oligodendrocytes and induced rapid demyelination. Demyelination was accompanied by increased microglia activation; however, the morphology and survival of astrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitors and neurons remained unaffected. In contrast, NMO AQP4-specific rAb initiated complement-dependent astrocyte damage, followed by sequential loss of oligodendrocytes, demyelination, microglia activation and neuronal death. Myelin-specific MS antibodies cause oligodendrocyte loss and demyelination in organotypic cerebellar slices, which are distinct from AQP4-targeted pathology, and display seminal features of active MS lesions. Myelin-specific antibodies may play an active role in MS lesion formation through complement-dependent mechanisms."
"Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is the most prevalent form of human prion disease and it is characterized by the presence of neuronal loss, spongiform degeneration, chronic inflammation and the accumulation of misfolded and pathogenic prion protein (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>). The molecular mechanisms underlying these alterations are largely unknown, but the presence of intracellular neuronal calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) overload, a general feature in models of prion diseases, is suggested to play a key role in prion pathogenesis.Here we describe the presence of massive regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responsive genes in sCJD brain tissue, accompanied by two Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent processes: endoplasmic reticulum stress and the activation of the cysteine proteases Calpains 1/2. Pathogenic Calpain proteins activation in sCJD is linked to the cleavage of their cellular substrates, impaired autophagy and lysosomal damage, which is partially reversed by Calpain inhibition in a cellular prion model. Additionally, Calpain 1 treatment enhances seeding activity of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in a prion conversion assay. Neuronal lysosomal impairment caused by Calpain over activation leads to the release of the lysosomal protease Cathepsin S that in sCJD mainly localises in axons, although massive Cathepsin S overexpression is detected in microglial cells. Alterations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and activation of Calpain-Cathepsin axis already occur at pre-clinical stages of the disease as detected in a humanized sCJD mouse model.Altogether our work indicates that unbalanced Calpain-Cathepsin activation is a relevant contributor to the pathogenesis of sCJD at multiple molecular levels and a potential target for therapeutic intervention."
"An intronic GGGGCC expansion in C9orf72 is the most common known cause of both frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The repeat expansion leads to the generation of sense and antisense repeat RNA aggregates and dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins, generated by repeat-associated non-ATG translation. The arginine-rich DPR proteins poly(glycine-arginine or GR) and poly(proline-arginine or PR) are potently neurotoxic and can localise to the nucleolus when expressed in cells, resulting in enlarged nucleoli with disrupted functionality. Furthermore, GGGGCC repeat RNA can bind nucleolar proteins in vitro. However, the relevance of nucleolar stress is unclear, as the arginine-rich DPR proteins do not localise to the nucleolus in C9orf72-associated FTLD/ALS (C9FTLD/ALS) patient brain. We measured nucleolar size in C9FTLD frontal cortex neurons using a three-dimensional, volumetric approach. Intriguingly, we found that C9FTLD brain exhibited bidirectional nucleolar stress. C9FTLD neuronal nucleoli were significantly smaller than control neuronal nucleoli. However, within C9FTLD brains, neurons containing poly(GR) inclusions had significantly larger nucleolar volumes than neurons without poly(GR) inclusions. In addition, expression of poly(GR) in adult Drosophila neurons led to significantly enlarged nucleoli. A small but significant increase in nucleolar volume was also observed in C9FTLD frontal cortex neurons containing GGGGCC repeat-containing RNA foci. These data show that nucleolar abnormalities are a consistent feature of C9FTLD brain, but that diverse pathomechanisms are at play, involving both DPR protein and repeat RNA toxicity."
"Congenital hydrocephalus is considered as either acquired due to haemorrhage, infection or neoplasia or as of developmental nature and is divided into two subgroups, communicating and obstructive. Congenital hydrocephalus is either syndromic or non-syndromic, and in the latter no cause is found in more than half of the patients. In patients with isolated hydrocephalus, L1CAM mutations represent the most common aetiology. More recently, a founder mutation has also been reported in the MPDZ gene in foetuses presenting massive hydrocephalus, but the neuropathology remains unknown. We describe here three novel homozygous null mutations in the MPDZ gene in foetuses whose post-mortem examination has revealed a homogeneous phenotype characterized by multiple ependymal malformations along the aqueduct of Sylvius, the third and fourth ventricles as well as the central canal of the medulla, consisting in multifocal rosettes with immature cell accumulation in the vicinity of ependymal lining early detached from the ventricular zone. MPDZ also named MUPP1 is an essential component of tight junctions which are expressed from early brain development in the choroid plexuses and ependyma. Alterations in the formation of tight junctions within the ependyma very likely account for the lesions observed and highlight for the first time that primary multifocal ependymal malformations of the ventricular system is genetically determined in humans. Therefore, MPDZ sequencing should be performed when neuropathological examination reveals multifocal ependymal rosette formation within the aqueduct of Sylvius, of the third and fourth ventricles and of the central canal of the medulla."
"&#x3b1;-Synuclein is a protein involved in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). We investigated the role of neuronal &#x3b1;-Syn in myelin composition and abnormalities. The phospholipid content of purified myelin was determined by <sup>31</sup>P NMR in two mouse lines modeling PD, PrP-A53T &#x3b1;-Syn and Thy-1 wt-&#x3b1;-Syn. Significantly higher levels of phospholipids were detected in myelin purified from brains of these &#x3b1;-Syn transgenic mouse models than in control mice. Nevertheless, myelin ultrastructure appeared intact. To further investigate the effect of &#x3b1;-Syn on myelin abnormalities, we systematically analyzed the striatum, a brain region associated with neurodegeneration in PD. An age and disease-dependent loss of myelin basic protein (MBP) signal was detected by immunohistochemistry in striatal striosomes (patches). The age-dependent loss of MBP signal was associated with lower P25&#x3b1; levels in oligodendrocytes. In addition, we found that &#x3b1;-Syn inhibited oligodendrocyte maturation and the formation of membranous sheets in vitro. Based on these results we concluded that neuronal &#x3b1;-Syn is involved in the regulation and/or maintenance of myelin phospholipid. However, axonal hypomyelination in the PD models is evident only in progressive stages of the disease and associated with &#x3b1;-Syn toxicity."
"Recent updating of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of central nervous system (CNS) tumors in 2016 demonstrates the first organized effort to restructure brain tumor classification by incorporating histomorphologic features with recurrent molecular alterations. Revised CNS tumor diagnostic criteria also attempt to reduce interobserver variability of histological interpretation and provide more accurate stratification related to clinical outcome. As an example, diffuse gliomas (WHO grades II-IV) are now molecularly stratified based upon isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDH) mutational status, with gliomas of WHO grades II and III being substratified according to 1p/19q codeletion status. For now, grading of diffuse gliomas is still dependent upon histological parameters. Independent of WHO classification criteria, multidimensional scaling analysis of molecular signatures for diffuse gliomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has identified distinct molecular subgroups, and allows for their visualization in 2-dimensional (2D) space. Using the web-based platform Oncoscape as a tool, we applied multidimensional scaling-derived molecular groups to the 2D visualization of the 2016 WHO classification of diffuse gliomas. Here we show that molecular multidimensional scaling of TCGA data provides 2D clustering that represents the 2016 WHO classification of diffuse gliomas. Additionally, we used this platform to successfully identify and define novel copy-number alteration-based molecular subtypes, which are independent of WHO grading, as well as predictive of clinical outcome. The prognostic utility of these molecular subtypes was further validated using an independent data set of the German Glioma Network prospective glioblastoma patient cohort."
"Most children with in utero alcohol exposure do not exhibit all features of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), and a challenge for clinicians is to make an early diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) to avoid lost opportunities for care. In brain, correct neurodevelopment requires proper angiogenesis. Since alcohol alters brain angiogenesis and the placenta is a major source of angiogenic factors, we hypothesized that it is involved in alcohol-induced brain vascular defects. In mouse, using in vivo repression and overexpression of PLGF, we investigated the contribution of placenta on fetal brain angiogenesis. In human, we performed a comparative molecular and morphological analysis of brain/placenta angiogenesis in alcohol-exposed fetuses. Results showed that prenatal alcohol exposure impairs placental angiogenesis, reduces PLGF levels and consequently alters fetal brain vasculature. Placental repression of PLGF altered brain VEGF-R1 expression and mimicked alcohol-induced vascular defects in the cortex. Over-expression of placental PGF rescued alcohol effects on fetal brain vessels. In human, alcohol exposure disrupted both placental and brain angiogenesis. PLGF expression was strongly decreased and angiogenesis defects observed in the fetal brain markedly correlated with placental vascular impairments. Placental PGF disruption impairs brain angiogenesis and likely predicts brain disabilities after in utero alcohol exposure. PLGF assay at birth could contribute to the early diagnosis of FASD."
"Proteins implicated in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) have been identified in bodily fluids encased in extracellular vesicles called exosomes. Whether exosomes found in DLB patients can transmit pathology is not clear. In this study, exosomes were successfully harvested through ultracentrifugation from brain tissue from DLB and AD patients as well as non-diseased brain tissue. Exosomes extracted from brains diagnosed with either AD or DLB contained aggregate-prone proteins. Furthermore, injection of brain-derived exosomes from DLB patients into the brains of wild type mice induced &#x3b1;-synuclein (&#x3b1;-syn) aggregation. As assessed through immunofluorescent double labeling, &#x3b1;-syn aggregation was observed in MAP2<sup>+</sup>, Rab5<sup>+</sup> neurons. Using a neuronal cell line, we also identified intracellular &#x3b1;-syn aggregation mediated by exosomes is dependent on recipient cell endocytosis. Together, these data suggest that exosomes from DLB patients are sufficient for seeding and propagating &#x3b1;-syn aggregation in vivo."
"Bioactive lipids contribute to the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis. Here, we show that lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs) are dysregulated in multiple sclerosis (MS) and are functionally relevant in this disease. LPAs and autotaxin, the major enzyme producing extracellular LPAs, were analyzed in serum and cerebrospinal fluid in a cross-sectional population of MS patients and were compared with respective data from mice in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, spontaneous EAE in TCR<sup>1640</sup> mice, and EAE in Lpar2 <sup>-/-</sup> mice. Serum LPAs were reduced in MS and EAE whereas spinal cord LPAs in TCR<sup>1640</sup> mice increased during the 'symptom-free' intervals, i.e. on resolution of inflammation during recovery hence possibly pointing to positive effects of brain LPAs during remyelination as suggested in previous studies. Peripheral LPAs mildly re-raised during relapses but further dropped in refractory relapses. The peripheral loss led to a redistribution of immune cells from the spleen to the spinal cord, suggesting defects of lymphocyte homing. In support, LPAR2 positive T-cells were reduced in EAE and the disease was intensified in Lpar2 deficient mice. Further, treatment with an LPAR2 agonist reduced clinical signs of relapsing-remitting EAE suggesting that the LPAR2 agonist partially compensated the endogenous loss of LPAs and implicating LPA signaling as a novel treatment approach. Graphical summary of lysophosphatidic signaling in multiple sclerosis."
"Amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) deposition is one of the hallmarks of the amyloid hypothesis in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mouse models using APP-transgene overexpression to generate amyloid plaques have shown to model only certain parts of the disease. The extent to which the data from mice can be transferred to man remains controversial. Several studies have shown convincing treatment results in reducing A&#x3b2; and enhancing cognition in mice but failed totally in human. One model-dependent factor has so far been almost completely neglected: the endogenous expression of mouse APP and its effects on the transgenic models and the readout for therapeutic approaches.Here, we report that hAPP-transgenic models of amyloidosis devoid of endogenous mouse APP expression (mAPP-knockout / mAPPko) show increased amounts and higher speed of A&#x3b2; deposition than controls with mAPP. The number of senile plaques and the level of aggregated hA&#x3b2; were elevated in mAPPko mice, while the deposition in cortical blood vessels was delayed, indicating an alteration in the general aggregation propensity of hA&#x3b2; together with endogenous mA&#x3b2;. Furthermore, the cellular response to A&#x3b2; deposition was modulated: mAPPko mice developed a pronounced and age-dependent astrogliosis, while microglial association to amyloid plaques was diminished. The expression of human and murine aggregation-prone proteins with differing amino acid sequences within the same mouse model might not only alter the extent of deposition but also modulate the route of pathogenesis, and thus, decisively influence the study outcome, especially in translational research."
"The recent global outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been linked to severe neurological disorders affecting the peripheral and central nervous systems (PNS and CNS, respectively). The pathobiology underlying these diverse clinical phenotypes are the subject of intense research; however, even the principal neural cell types vulnerable to productive Zika infection remain poorly characterised. Here we used CNS and PNS myelinating cultures from wild type and Ifnar1 knockout mice to examine neuronal and glial tropism and short-term consequences of direct infection with a Brazilian variant of ZIKV. Cell cultures were infected pre- or post-myelination for various intervals, then stained with cell-type and ZIKV-specific antibodies. In bypassing systemic immunity using ex vivo culture, and the type I interferon response in Ifnar1 deficient cells, we were able to evaluate the intrinsic infectivity of neural cells. Through systematic quantification of ZIKV infected cells in myelinating cultures, we found that ZIKV infection is enhanced in the absence of the type I interferon responses and that CNS cells are considerably more susceptible to infection than PNS cells. In particular, we demonstrate that CNS axons and myelinating oligodendrocytes are especially vulnerable to injury. These results have implications for understanding the pathobiology of neurological symptoms associated with ZIKV infection. Furthermore, we provide a quantifiable ex vivo infection model that can be used for fundamental and therapeutic studies on viral neuroinvasion and its consequences."
"The immunoproteasome (iP) represents a specialized type of proteasomes, which plays an important role in the clearance of oxidant-damaged proteins under inflammatory and pathological conditions determining the outcome of various diseases. In Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like APPPS1 mice A&#x3b2;-deposition is paralleled by iP upregulation, most likely mediated through type I interferon induction. To define the impact of increased iP expression we crossed APPPS1 mice with mice deficient in the iP subunit LMP7 resulting in impaired iP function. While LMP7 deficient APPPS1 mice showed no major change in cerebral A&#x3b2;-pathology, we observed an altered cytokine response in microglia isolated from LMP7 deficient APPPS1 mice compared to LMP7 expressing APPPS1 control mice. The altered microglial cytokine profile upon iP deficiency in the presence of extracellular A&#x3b2;-pathology was associated with an improvement of A&#x3b2;-associated cognitive deficits typically present in APPPS1 mice. Our findings suggest a role for iP in the regulation of the innate immune response towards extracellular A&#x3b2;-pathology and indicate that inhibition of iP function can modulate the cognitive phenotype upon overexpression of A&#x3b2;."
"Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) encompasses certain related neurodegenerative disorders which alter personality and cognition. Heterogeneous ribonuclear proteins (hnRNPs) maintain RNA metabolism and changes in their function may underpin the pathogenesis of FTLD. Immunostaining for hnRNP E2 was performed on sections of frontal and temporal cortex with hippocampus from 80 patients with FTLD, stratified by pathology into FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP type A, B and C subtypes, and by genetics into patients with C9orf72 expansions, MAPT or GRN mutations, or those with no known mutation, and on 10 healthy controls. Semi-quantitative analysis assessed hnRNP staining in frontal and temporal cortex, and in dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus, in the different pathology and genetic groups. We find that hnRNP E2 immunostaining detects the TDP-43 positive dystrophic neurites (DN) within frontal and temporal cortex, and the neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCI) seen in DG granule cells, characteristic of patients with Semantic Dementia (SD) and type C TDP-43 pathology, but did not detect TDP-43 or tau inclusions in any of the other pathological or genetic variants of FTLD. Double immunofluorescence for hnRNP E2 and TDP-43 showed most TDP-43 immunopositive DN to contain hnRNP E2. Present findings indicate an association between TDP-43 and hnRNP E2 which might underlie the pathogenetic mechanism of this form of FTLD."
"Elevated iron in the SNpc may play a key role in Parkinson's disease (PD) neurodegeneration since drug candidates with high iron affinity rescue PD animal models, and one candidate, deferirpone, has shown efficacy recently in a phase two clinical trial. However, strong iron chelators may perturb essential iron metabolism, and it is not yet known whether the damage associated with iron is mediated by a tightly bound (eg ferritin) or lower-affinity, labile, iron pool. Here we report the preclinical characterization of PBT434, a novel quinazolinone compound bearing a moderate affinity metal-binding motif, which is in development for Parkinsonian conditions. In vitro, PBT434 was far less potent than deferiprone or deferoxamine at lowering cellular iron levels, yet was found to inhibit iron-mediated redox activity and iron-mediated aggregation of &#x3b1;-synuclein, a protein that aggregates in the neuropathology. In vivo, PBT434 did not deplete tissue iron stores in normal rodents, yet prevented loss of substantia nigra pars compacta neurons (SNpc), lowered nigral &#x3b1;-synuclein accumulation, and rescued motor performance in mice exposed to the Parkinsonian toxins 6-OHDA and MPTP, and in a transgenic animal model (hA53T &#x3b1;-synuclein) of PD. These improvements were associated with reduced markers of oxidative damage, and increased levels of ferroportin (an iron exporter) and DJ-1. We conclude that compounds designed to target a pool of pathological iron that is not held in high-affinity complexes in the tissue can maintain the survival of SNpc neurons and could be disease-modifying in PD."
"Neurofilament heavy chain (NEFH) gene was recently identified to cause autosomal dominant axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT2cc). However, the clinical spectrum of this condition and the physio-pathological pathway remain to be delineated. We report 12 patients from two French families with axonal dominantly inherited form of CMT caused by two new mutations in the NEFH gene. A remarkable feature was the early involvement of proximal muscles of the lower limbs associated with pyramidal signs in some patients. Nerve conduction velocity studies indicated a predominantly motor axonal neuropathy. Unique deletions of two nucleotides causing frameshifts near the end of the NEFH coding sequence were identified: in family 1, c.3008_3009del (p.Lys1003Argfs*59), and in family 2 c.3043_3044del (p.Lys1015Glyfs*47). Both frameshifts lead to 40 additional amino acids translation encoding a cryptic amyloidogenic element. Consistently, we show that these mutations cause protein aggregation which are recognised by the autophagic pathway in motoneurons and triggered caspase 3 activation leading to apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. Using electroporation of chick embryo spinal cord, we confirm that NEFH mutants form aggregates in vivo and trigger apoptosis of spinal cord neurons. Thus, our results provide a physiological explanation for the overlap between CMT and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) clinical features in affected patients."
"Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, defined by the presence of brain pathological inclusions comprised of abnormally aggregated and highly phosphorylated tau protein. The abundance of brain tau aggregates correlates with disease severity and select phospho-tau epitopes increase at early stages of disease. We generated and characterized a series of novel monoclonal antibodies directed to tau phosphorylated at several of these phospho-epitopes, including Ser396/Ser404, Ser404 and Thr205. We also generated phosphorylation independent antibodies against amino acid residues 193-211. We show that most of these antibodies are highly specific for tau and strongly recognize pathological inclusions in human brains and in a transgenic mouse model of tauopathy. They also reveal epitope-specific differences in the biochemical properties of Alzheimer's disease sarkosyl-insoluble tau. These new reagents will be useful for investigating the progression of tau pathology and further as tools to target the cellular transmission of tau pathology."
"Spatiotemporal tau pathology progression is regarded as highly stereotyped within each type of degenerative condition. For instance, AD has a progression of tau pathology consistently beginning in the entorhinal cortex, the locus coeruleus, and other nearby noradrenergic brainstem nuclei, before spreading to the rest of the limbic system as well as the cingulate and retrosplenial cortices. Proposed explanations for the consistent spatial patterns of tau pathology progression, as well as for why certain regions are selectively vulnerable to exhibiting pathology over the course of disease generally focus on transsynaptic spread proceeding via the brain's anatomic connectivity network in a cell-independent manner or on cell-intrinsic properties that might render some cell populations or regions uniquely vulnerable. We test connectivity based explanations of spatiotemporal tau pathology progression and regional vulnerability against cell-intrinsic explanation, using regional gene expression profiles as a proxy. We find that across both exogenously seeded and non-seeded tauopathic mouse models, the connectivity network provides a better explanation than regional gene expression profiles, even when such profiles are limited to specific sets of tau risk-related genes only. Our results suggest that, regardless of the location of pathology initiation, tau pathology progression is well characterized by a model positing entirely cell-type and molecular environment independent transsynaptic spread via the mouse brain's connectivity network. These results further suggest that regional vulnerability to tau pathology is mainly governed by connectivity with regions already exhibiting pathology, rather than by cell-intrinsic factors."
"Pathogenesis in aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G (AQP4-IgG) seropositive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (herein called NMO) involves complement-dependent cytotoxicity initiated by AQP4-IgG binding to astrocyte AQP4. We recently reported that rats lacking complement inhibitor protein CD59 were highly susceptible to development of NMO pathology in brain and spinal cord following direct AQP4-IgG administration (Yao and Verkman, Acta Neuropath Commun 2017, 5:15). Here, we report evidence that CD59 is responsible for protection of peripheral, AQP4-expressing tissues in seropositive NMO. Rats made seropositive by intraperitoneal injection of AQP4-IgG developed marked weakness by 24&#xa0;h and died soon thereafter. Serum creatine phosphokinase at 24&#xa0;h was &gt;900-fold greater in seropositive CD59<sup>-/-</sup> rats than in seropositive CD59<sup>+/+</sup> (or control) rats. AQP4-expressing cells in skeletal muscle and kidney, but not in stomach, of seropositive CD59<sup>-/-</sup> rats showed injury with deposition of AQP4-IgG and activated complement C5b-9, and inflammation. Organ injury in seropositive CD59<sup>-/-</sup> rats was prevented by a complement inhibitor. Significant pathological changes in seropositive CD59<sup>-/-</sup> rats were not seen in optic nerve, spinal cord or brain, including circumventricular tissue. These results implicate a major protective role of CD59 outside of the central nervous system in seropositive NMO, and hence offer an explanation as to why peripheral, AQP4-expressing cells are largely unaffected in NMO."
"Pompe disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by acid-&#x3b1;-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency, leading to glycogen storage. The disease manifests as a fatal cardiomyopathy in infantile form. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has recently prolonged the lifespan of these patients, revealing a new natural history. The neurologic phenotype and the persistence of selective muscular weakness in some patients could be attributed to the central nervous system (CNS) storage uncorrected by ERT. GAA-KO 6neo/6neo mice were treated with a single intrathecal administration of adeno-associated recombinant vector (AAV) mediated gene transfer of human GAA at 1 month and their neurologic, neuromuscular, and cardiac function was assessed for 1 year. We demonstrate a significant functional neurologic correction in treated animals from 4&#xa0;months onward, a neuromuscular improvement from 9&#xa0;months onward, and a correction of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at 12&#xa0;months. The regions most affected by the disease i.e. the brainstem, spinal cord, and the left cardiac ventricular wall all show enzymatic, biochemical and histological correction. Muscle glycogen storage is not affected by the treatment, thus suggesting that the restoration of muscle functionality is directly related to the CNS correction. This unprecedented global and long-term CNS and cardiac cure offer new perspectives for the management of patients."
"A dysfunctional endosomal pathway and abnormally enlarged early endosomes in neurons are an early characteristic of Down syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have hypothesized that endosomal material can be released by endosomal multivesicular bodies (MVBs) into the extracellular space via exosomes to relieve neurons of accumulated endosomal contents when endosomal pathway function is compromised. Supporting this, we found that exosome secretion is enhanced in the brains of DS patients and a mouse model of the disease, and by DS fibroblasts. Furthermore, increased levels of the tetraspanin CD63, a regulator of exosome biogenesis, were observed in DS brains. Importantly, CD63 knockdown diminished exosome release and worsened endosomal pathology in DS fibroblasts. Taken together, these data suggest that increased CD63 expression enhances exosome release as an endogenous mechanism mitigating endosomal abnormalities in DS. Thus, the upregulation of exosome release represents a potential therapeutic goal for neurodegenerative disorders with endosomal pathology."
"Abnormal protein aggregation has been implicated in neurodegenerative processes in human neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Recently, studies have established a novel concept that protein aggregates are transmitted among neuronal cells. By extension, such interneuronal aggregate transmission has been hypothesized to be the underlying mechanism for the pathological and clinical disease progression. However, the precise mechanism of the interneuronal aggregate transmission remains ill-defined. Recent reports have suggested that exosomes, a specific group of extracellular vesicles that are involved in intercellular transfer of cellular macromolecules such as proteins and RNAs, could play an important role in the aggregate transmission among neurons. Here, we review various types of extracellular vesicles and critically evaluate the evidence supporting the role of exosomes in interneuronal aggregate transmission and neurodegeneration. We also discuss the competing mechanisms other than the exosome-mediated transmission. By doing so, we aim to assess the current state of knowledge on the mechanism of interneuronal aggregate transmission and suggest the future directions of research towards understanding the mechanism."
"Microsatellites, or simple tandem repeat sequences, occur naturally in the human genome and have important roles in genome evolution and function. However, the expansion of microsatellites is associated with over two dozen neurological diseases. A common denominator among the majority of these disorders is the expression of expanded tandem repeat-containing RNA, referred to as xtrRNA in this review, which can mediate molecular disease pathology in multiple ways. This review focuses on the potential impact that simple tandem repeat expansions can have on the biology and metabolism of RNA that contain them and underscores important gaps in understanding. Merging the molecular biology of repeat expansion disorders with the current understanding of RNA biology, including splicing, transcription, transport, turnover and translation, will help clarify mechanisms of disease and improve therapeutic development."
"Parkinson's disease (PD) pathophysiology develops in part from the formation, transmission, and aggregation of toxic species of the protein &#x3b1;-synuclein (&#x3b1;-syn). Recent evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs) may play a vital role in the transport of toxic &#x3b1;-syn between brain regions. Moreover, increasing evidence has highlighted the participation of peripheral molecules, particularly inflammatory species, which may influence or exacerbate the development of PD-related changes to the central nervous system (CNS), although detailed characterization of these species remains to be completed. Despite these findings, little attention has been devoted to erythrocytes, which contain &#x3b1;-syn concentrations ~1000-fold higher than the cerebrospinal fluid, as a source of potentially pathogenic &#x3b1;-syn. Here, we demonstrate that erythrocytes produce &#x3b1;-syn-rich EVs, which can cross the BBB, particularly under inflammatory conditions provoked by peripheral administration of lipopolysaccharide. This transport likely occurs via adsorptive-mediated transcytosis, with EVs that transit the BBB co-localizing with brain microglia. Examination of microglial reactivity upon exposure to &#x3b1;-syn-containing erythrocyte EVs in vitro and in vivo revealed that uptake provoked an increase in microglial inflammatory responses. EVs derived from the erythrocytes of PD patients elicited stronger responses than did those of control subjects, suggesting that inherent characteristics of EVs arising in the periphery might contribute to, or even initiate, CNS &#x3b1;-syn-related pathology. These results provide new insight into the mechanisms by which the brain and periphery communicate throughout the process of synucleinopathy pathogenesis."
"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP) is associated with the accumulation of pathological neuronal and glial intracytoplasmic inclusions as well as accompanying neuron loss. We explored if cortical neurons detected by NeuN decreased with increasing TDP-43 inclusion pathology in the postmortem brains of 63 patients with sporadic and familial FTLD-TDP. Semi-automated quantitative algorithms to quantify histology in tissue sections stained with antibodies specific for pathological or phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) and NeuN were developed and validated in affected (cerebral cortex) and minimally affected (cerebellar cortex) brain regions of FTLD-TDP cases. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for NeuN and other neuronal markers found numerous neurons lacking reactivity, suggesting NeuN may reflect neuron health rather than neuron loss in FTLD. We found three patterns of NeuN and pTDP-43 reactivity in our sample of cortical tissue representing three intracortical region-specific stages of FTLD-TDP progression: Group 1 showed low levels of pathological pTDP-43 and high levels NeuN, while Group 2 showed increased levels of pTDP-43, and Group 3 tissues were characterized by reduced staining for both pTDP-43 and NeuN. Comparison of non-C9orf72/GRN FTLD-TDP with cases linked to both GRN mutations and C9orf72 expansions showed a significantly increased frequency of Group 3 histopathology in the latter cases, suggesting more advanced cortical disease. Hence, we propose that IHC profiles of pTDP-43 and NeuN reflect the burden of pTDP-43 and its deleterious effects on neuron health."
"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a potentially fatal autoimmune disease that is often accompanied by brain atrophy and diverse neuropsychiatric manifestations of unknown origin. More recently, it was observed that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients and lupus-prone mice can be neurotoxic and that acute administration of specific brain-reactive autoantibodies (BRAs) can induce deficits in isolated behavioral tasks. Given the chronic and complex nature of CNS SLE, the current study examines broad behavioral performance and neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in mice receiving a&#xa0;sustained infusion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from CNS SLE patients and putative BRAs (anti-NR2A, anti-ribosomal P, and anti-&#x3b1;-tubulin). A 2-week intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of CSF altered home-cage behavior and induced olfactory dysfunction, excessive immobility in the forced swim test, and perseveration in a learning task. Conversely, sustained administration of purified BRAs produced relatively mild, both inhibitory and stimulatory effects on olfaction, spatial learning/memory, and home-cage behavior. In vitro studies revealed that administration of some CSF samples induces a rapid influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> into murine neurons, an effect that could be partially mimicked with the commercial anti-NR2A antibody and blocked with selective N-methyl-D-aspartate &#xfeff;(NMDA) receptor antagonists. The current findings confirm that the CSF from CNS SLE patients can be neuroactive and support the hypothesis that intrathecal BRAs induce synergistically diverse effects on all domains of behavior. In addition, anti-NMDA receptor antibodies may alter Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis of central neurons, thus accounting for excitotoxicity and contributing to the heterogeneity of psychiatric manifestations in CNS SLE and other autoantibody-related brain disorders."
"Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) are believed to be one of the first cell types to be affected in all forms of AD, and their dysfunction is clinically correlated with impaired short-term memory formation and retrieval. We present an optimized in vitro protocol to generate human BFCNs from iPSCs, using cell lines from presenilin 2 (PSEN2) mutation carriers and controls. As expected, cell lines harboring the PSEN2 <sup>N141I</sup> mutation displayed an increase in the A&#x3b2;42/40 in iPSC-derived BFCNs. Neurons derived from PSEN2 <sup>N141I</sup> lines generated fewer maximum number of spikes in response to a square depolarizing current injection. The height of the first action potential at rheobase current injection was also significantly decreased in PSEN2 <sup>N141I</sup> BFCNs. CRISPR/Cas9 correction of the PSEN2 point mutation abolished the electrophysiological deficit, restoring both the maximal number of spikes and spike height to the levels recorded in controls. Increased A&#x3b2;42/40 was also normalized following CRISPR/Cas-mediated correction of the PSEN2 <sup>N141I</sup> mutation. The genome editing data confirms the robust consistency of mutation-related changes in A&#x3b2;42/40 ratio while also showing a PSEN2-mutation-related alteration in electrophysiology."
"The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs or Batten disease) are a group of inherited, fatal neurodegenerative disorders of childhood. In these disorders, glial (microglial and astrocyte) activation typically occurs early in disease progression and predicts where neuron loss subsequently occurs. We have found that in the most common juvenile form of NCL (CLN3 disease or JNCL) this glial response is less pronounced in both mouse models and human autopsy material, with the morphological transformation of both astrocytes and microglia severely attenuated or delayed. To investigate their properties, we isolated glia and neurons from Cln3-deficient mice and studied their basic biology in culture. Upon stimulation, both Cln3-deficient astrocytes and microglia also showed an attenuated ability to transform morphologically, and an altered protein secretion profile. These defects were more pronounced in astrocytes, including the reduced secretion of a range of neuroprotective factors, mitogens, chemokines and cytokines, in addition to impaired calcium signalling and glutamate clearance. Cln3-deficient neurons also displayed an abnormal organization of their neurites. Most importantly, using a co-culture system, Cln3-deficient astrocytes and microglia had a negative impact on the survival and morphology of both Cln3-deficient and wildtype neurons, but these effects were largely reversed by growing mutant neurons with healthy glia. These data provide evidence that CLN3 disease astrocytes are functionally compromised. Together with microglia, they may play an active role in neuron loss in this disorder and can be considered as potential targets for therapeutic interventions."
"The identification of the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) as the ubiquitinated cytoplasmic inclusions in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) confirmed that these two diseases share similar mechanisms, likely to be linked to the abnormal hyperphosphorylation, ubiquitination and cleavage of pathological TDP-43. Importantly however, a quantitative analysis of TDP-43 inclusions in predilection cortical regions of FTLD, FTLD-ALS and ALS cases has not been undertaken. The present study set out to assess this and demonstrates that distinct TDP-43 inclusion morphologies exist in the anterior cingulate cortex, but not the motor cortex of FTLD and FTLD-ALS. Specifically, in the anterior cingulate cortex of FTLD cases, significant rounded TDP-43 inclusions and rare circumferential TDP-43 inclusions were identified. In contrast, FTLD-ALS cases revealed significant circumferential TDP-43 inclusions and rare rounded TDP-43 inclusions in the anterior cingulate cortex. Distinct TDP-43 inclusion morphologies in the anterior cingulate cortex of FTLD and FTLD-ALS may be linked to heterogeneity in the ubiquitination of pathological TDP-43 inclusions, with the present study providing evidence to suggest the involvement of distinct pathomechanisms in these two overlapping clinical syndromes."
"It is now widely accepted in the field that the normally secreted chaperone clusterin is redirected to the cytosol during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, although the physiological function(s) of this physical relocation remain unknown. We have examined in this study whether or not increased expression of clusterin is able to protect neuronal cells against intracellular protein aggregation and cytotoxicity, characteristics that are strongly implicated in a range of neurodegenerative diseases. We used the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-associated protein TDP-43 as a primary model to investigate the effects of clusterin on protein aggregation and neurotoxicity in complementary in vitro, neuronal cell and Drosophila systems. We have shown that clusterin directly interacts with TDP-43 in vitro and potently inhibits its aggregation, and observed that in ER stressed neuronal cells, clusterin co-localized with TDP-43 and specifically reduced the numbers of cytoplasmic inclusions. We further showed that the expression of TDP-43 in transgenic Drosophila neurons induced ER stress and that co-expression of clusterin resulted in a dramatic clearance of mislocalized TDP-43 from motor neuron axons, partially rescued locomotor activity and significantly extended lifespan. We also showed that in Drosophila photoreceptor cells, clusterin co-expression gave ER stress-dependent protection against proteotoxicity arising from both Huntingtin-Q128 and mutant (R406W) human tau. We therefore conclude that increased expression of clusterin can provide an important defense against intracellular proteotoxicity under conditions that mimic specific features of neurodegenerative disease."
"Blast-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been a common cause of injury in the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Blast waves can damage blood vessels, neurons, and glial cells within the brain. Acutely, depending on the blast energy, blast wave duration, and number of exposures, blast waves disrupt the blood-brain barrier, triggering microglial activation and neuroinflammation. Recently, there has been much interest in the role that ongoing neuroinflammation may play in the chronic effects of TBI. Here, we investigated whether chronic neuroinflammation is present in a rat model of repetitive low-energy blast exposure. Six weeks after three 74.5-kPa blast exposures, and in the absence of hemorrhage, no significant alteration in the level of microglia activation was found. At 6&#xa0;weeks after blast exposure, plasma levels of fractalkine, interleukin-1&#x3b2;, lipopolysaccharide-inducible CXC chemokine, macrophage inflammatory protein 1&#x3b1;, and vascular endothelial growth factor were decreased. However, no differences in cytokine levels were detected between blast-exposed and control rats at 40&#xa0;weeks. In brain, isolated changes were seen in levels of selected cytokines at 6&#xa0;weeks following blast exposure, but none of these changes was found in both&#xa0;hemispheres or at 40&#xa0;weeks after blast exposure. Notably, one animal with a focal hemorrhagic tear showed chronic microglial activation around the lesion 16&#xa0;weeks post-blast exposure. These findings suggest that focal hemorrhage can trigger chronic focal neuroinflammation following blast-induced TBI, but that in the absence of hemorrhage, chronic neuroinflammation is not a general feature of low-level blast injury."
"Hypersynchronous neuronal excitation manifests clinically as seizure (ictogenesis), and may recur spontaneously and repetitively after a variable latency period (epileptogenesis). Despite tremendous research efforts to describe molecular pathways and signatures of epileptogenesis, molecular pathomechanisms leading to chronic epilepsy remain to be clarified. We hypothesized that epigenetic modifications may form the basis for a cellular memory of epileptogenesis, and used a primary neuronal cell culture model of the rat hippocampus to study the translation of massive neuronal excitation into persisting changes of epigenetic signatures and pro-epileptogenic target gene expression. Increased spontaneous activation of cultured neurons was detected 3 and 7&#xa0;days after stimulation with 10&#xa0;&#x3bc;M glutamate when compared to sham-treated time-matched controls using calcium-imaging in vitro. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed short-term (3&#xa0;h, 7&#xa0;h, and 24&#xa0;h) and long-term (3 d and 2&#xa0;weeks) changes in histone modifications, which were directly linked to decreased expression of two selected epilepsy target genes, e.g. excitatory glutamate receptor genes Gria2 and Grin2a. Increased promoter methylation observed 4&#xa0;weeks after glutamate stimulation at respective genes suggested long-term repression of Gria2 and Grin2a genes. Inhibition of glutamatergic activation or blocking the propagation of action potentials in cultured neurons rescued altered gene expression and regulatory epigenetic modifications. Our data support the concept of a cellular memory of epileptogenesis and persisting epigenetic modifications of epilepsy target genes, which are able to turn normal into pro-epileptic neurons and circuits."
"Since the discovery of the microtubule-associated protein Tau (MAPT) over 40 years ago, most studies have focused on Tau's role in microtubule stability and regulation, as well as on the neuropathological consequences of Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. In recent years, however, research efforts identified new interaction partners and different sub-cellular localizations for Tau suggesting additional roles beyond its standard function as microtubule regulating protein. Moreover, despite the increasing research focus on AD over the last decades, Tau was only recently considered as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment and prevention of AD as well as for neurological pathologies beyond AD e.g. epilepsy, excitotoxicity, and environmental stress. This review will focus on atypical, non-standard roles of Tau on neuronal function and dysfunction in AD and other neurological pathologies providing novel insights about neuroplastic and neuropathological implications of Tau in both the central and the peripheral nervous system."
"Genetic variation in a major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII)-encoding gene (HLA-DR) increases risk for Parkinson disease (PD), and the accumulation of MHCII-expressing immune cells in the brain correlates with &#x3b1;-synuclein inclusions. However, the timing of MHCII-cell recruitment with respect to ongoing neurodegeneration, and the types of cells that express MHCII in the PD brain, has been difficult to understand. Recent studies show that the injection of short &#x3b1;-synuclein fibrils into the rat substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) induces progressive inclusion formation in SNpc neurons that eventually spread to spiny projection neurons in the striatum. Herein, we find that &#x3b1;-synuclein fibrils rapidly provoke a persistent MHCII response in the brain. In contrast, equivalent amounts of monomeric &#x3b1;-synuclein fail to induce MHCII or persistent microglial activation, consistent with our results in primary microglia. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analyses reveal that MHCII-expressing cells are composed of both resident microglia as well as cells from the periphery that include monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes. Over time, &#x3b1;-Synuclein fibril exposures in the SNpc causes both axon loss as well as monocyte recruitment in the striatum. While these monocytes in the striatum initially lack MHCII expression, &#x3b1;-synuclein inclusions later form in nearby spiny projection neurons and MHCII expression becomes robust. In summary, in the rat &#x3b1;-synuclein fibril model, peripheral immune cell recruitment occurs prior to neurodegeneration and microglia, monocytes and macrophages all contribute to MHCII expression."
"In neuroinflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis, the physiological function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is perturbed, particularly in demyelinating lesions and supposedly secondary to acute demyelinating pathology. Using the toxic non-inflammatory cuprizone model of demyelination, we demonstrate, however, that the onset of persistent BBB impairment precedes demyelination. In addition to a direct effect of cuprizone on endothelial cells, a plethora of inflammatory mediators, which are mainly of astroglial origin during the initial disease phase, likely contribute to the destabilization of endothelial barrier function in vivo. Our study reveals that, at different time points of pathology and in different CNS regions, the level of gliosis correlates with the extent of BBB hyperpermeability and edema. Furthermore, in mutant mice with abolished type 3 CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR3) signaling, inflammatory responses are dampened and BBB dysfunction ameliorated. Together, these data have implications for understanding the role of BBB permeability in the pathogenesis of demyelinating disease."
"While Munc18-1 interacts with Syntaxin1 and controls the formation of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNARE) complex to regulate presynaptic vesicle fusion in developed neurons, this molecule is likely to be involved in brain development since its gene abnormalities cause early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-burst (Ohtahara syndrome), neonatal epileptic encephalopathy and other neurodevelopmental disorders. We thus analyzed physiological significance of Munc18-1 during cortical development. Munc18-1-knockdown impaired cortical neuron positioning during mouse corticogenesis. Time-lapse imaging revealed that the mispositioning was attributable to defects in radial migration in the intermediate zone and cortical plate. Notably, Syntaxin1A was critical for radial migration downstream of Munc18-1. As for the underlying mechanism, Munc18-1-knockdown in cortical neurons hampered post-Golgi vesicle trafficking and subsequent vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Notably, Syntaxin1A-silencing did not affect the post-Golgi vesicle trafficking. Taken together, Munc18-1 was suggested to regulate radial migration by modulating not only vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane to distribute various proteins on the cell surface for interaction with radial fibers, but also preceding vesicle transport from Golgi to the plasma membrane. Although knockdown experiments suggested that Syntaxin1A does not participate in the vesicle trafficking, it was supposed to regulate subsequent vesicle fusion under the control of Munc18-1. These observations may shed light on the mechanism governing radial migration of cortical neurons. Disruption of Munc18-1 function may result in the abnormal corticogenesis, leading to neurodevelopmental disorders with MUNC18-1 gene abnormalities."
"People with Down syndrome (DS) are at high risk for developing Alzheimer disease (AD) with age. Typically, by age 40&#xa0;years, most people with DS have sufficient neuropathology for an AD diagnosis. Interestingly, atherosclerosis and hypertension are atypical in DS with age, suggesting the lack of these vascular risk factors may be associated with reduced cerebrovascular pathology. However, because the extra copy of APP leads to increased beta-amyloid peptide (A&#x3b2;) accumulation in DS, we hypothesized that there would be more extensive and widespread cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) with age in DS relative to sporadic AD. To test this hypothesis CAA, atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis were used as measures of cerebrovascular pathology and compared in post mortem tissue from individuals with DS (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;32), sporadic AD (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;80) and controls (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;37). CAA was observed with significantly higher frequencies in brains of individuals with DS compared to sporadic AD and controls. Atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis were rare in the cases with DS. CAA in DS may be a target for future interventional clinical trials."
"The authors are retracting this article. The article describes mice expressing wild-type human MATR3. However, since publication the authors have become aware that all of the lines of mice described express human MATR3 containing the F115C mutation. Transgenic mice expressing wild-type and mutant Matrin were created simultaneously in their laboratory and, at a crucial stage of generating the DNA for embryo injection, as confirmed by an investigation by the University of Florida, the DNA preparations were accidentally mislabelled. All of the founders created were mosaic, requiring extensive breeding to isolate stable lines. Mice mislabelled as expressing wild-type MATR3 were the first to produce lines that stably transmitted the transgene and thus were the first to be characterized. However, as lines of mice that were mislabelled as expressing the mutant (F115C) MATR3 were ultimately established, the data began to suggest that an error had been made. Sequence analysis of amplified tail DNA from mice descended from the lines reported in the article have revealed that they express the F115C variant. The data described are therefore an accurate description of the pathology of mice that express the F115C variant of MATR3, but not of mice expressing wild-type MATR3. The authors are preparing a new manuscript reporting data from both mice expressing the F115C variant of MATR3 and mice expressing wild-type MATR3."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia among older adults. Accumulation of amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) in the brain is considered central in AD pathogenesis and its understanding crucial for developing new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Recent literature suggests that ageing may induce post translational modifications in A&#x3b2;, in the form of spontaneous amino acid modifications, which enhance its pathogenic properties, contributing to its aggregation.In this study, we have investigated whether the isoaspartate (IsoD-A&#x3b2;) and pyroglutamate (pE3-A&#x3b2;) modified forms of A&#x3b2; are significantly associated with AD pathology or represent markers of ageing. Cerebral neocortex of 27&#xa0;AD cases, 32 old controls (OC) and 11 young controls (YC) was immunostained for pE3-A&#x3b2; and IsoD-A&#x3b2;, quantified as protein load and correlated with other A&#x3b2; forms and p-TAU. IsoD-A&#x3b2; and pE3-A&#x3b2; were detected at low levels in non-demented controls, and significantly increased in AD (p&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;0.001), with a characteristic deposition of IsoD-A&#x3b2; in blood vessel walls and pE3-A&#x3b2; within neurons. Both AD and OC showed positive associations between IsoD-A&#x3b2; and A&#x3b2; (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003 in AD and p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001 in OC) and between IsoD-A&#x3b2; and pE3-A&#x3b2; (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001 in AD and OC). This last association was the only significant pE3-A&#x3b2; correlation identified in AD, whereas in the control cohorts pE3-A&#x3b2; also correlated with A&#x3b2; and A&#x3b2;PP (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001 in OC and p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.010 in YC).Our analyses suggest that IsoD-A&#x3b2; accumulation starts with ageing; whereas pE3-A&#x3b2; deposition is more closely linked to AD. Our findings support the importance of age-related modifications of A&#x3b2; in AD pathogenesis."
"Neurodegenerative diseases are linked to a systemic enzyme resistance of toxic aggregated molecules and their pathological consequences. This paper presents a unique phenomenon that Philodina acuticornis, a bdelloid rotifer, is able to catabolize different types of neurotoxic peptide and protein aggregates (such as beta-amyloids /A&#x3b2;/, alpha-synuclein, and prion) without suffering any damage. P. acuticornis is capable of using these aggregates as an exclusive energy source (i.e., as 'food', identified in the digestive system and body) in a hermetically isolated microdrop environment, increasing their survival. As regards A&#x3b2;1-42, five other bdelloid rotifer species were also found to be able to perform this phenomenon. Based on our experiments, the A&#x3b2;1-42-treated bdelloid rotifers demonstrate significantly increased survival (e.g. mean lifespan&#x2009;=&#x2009;51&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.71&#xa0;days) compared to their untreated controls (e.g. mean lifespan&#x2009;=&#x2009;14&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.29&#xa0;days), with similar improvements in a variety of phenotypic characteristics. To our knowledge, no other animal species have so far been reported to have a similar capability. For all other microscopic species tested, including monogonant rotifers and non-rotifers, the treatment with A&#x3b2;1-42 aggregates proved to be either toxic or simply ineffective. This paper describes and proves the existence of an unprecedented in vivo catabolic capability of neurotoxic aggregates by bdelloid rotifers, with special focus on P. acuticornis. Our results may provide the basis for a new preclinical perspective on therapeutic research in human neurodegenerative diseases."
"The diagnosis and treatment of synucleinopathies such as Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies would be aided by the availability of assays for the pathogenic disease-associated forms of &#x3b1;-synuclein (&#x3b1;Syn<sup>D</sup>) that are sufficiently sensitive, specific, and practical for analysis of accessible diagnostic specimens. Two recent &#x3b1;Syn<sup>D</sup> seed amplification tests have provided the first prototypes for ultrasensitive and specific detection of &#x3b1;Syn<sup>D</sup> in patients' cerebrospinal fluid. These prototypic assays require 5-13&#xa0;days to perform. Here, we describe an improved &#x3b1;-synuclein real time quaking-induced conversion (&#x3b1;Syn RT-QuIC) assay that has similar sensitivity and specificity to the prior assays, but can be performed in 1-2&#xa0;days with quantitation. Blinded analysis of cerebrospinal fluid from 29 synucleinopathy cases [12 Parkinson's and 17 dementia with Lewy bodies] and 31 non-synucleinopathy controls, including 16 Alzheimer's cases, yielded 93% diagnostic sensitivity and 100% specificity for this test so far. End-point dilution analyses allowed quantitation of relative amounts of &#x3b1;Syn<sup>D</sup> seeding activity in cerebrospinal fluid samples, and detection in as little as 0.2&#xa0;&#x3bc;L. These results confirm that &#x3b1;Syn<sup>D</sup> seeding activity is present in cerebrospinal fluid. We also demonstrate that it can be rapidly detected, and quantitated, even in early symptomatic stages of synucleinopathy."
"In Parkinson's disease (PD) there is widespread accumulation in the brain of abnormal &#x3b1;-synuclein aggregates forming intraneuronal Lewy bodies (LB). It is now well established that LB-type &#x3b1;-synuclein aggregates also occur in the peripheral autonomic nervous system in PD, from where it has been speculated they may progressively spread to the central nervous system through synaptically-connected brain networks and reach the substantia nigra to trigger herein dopaminergic dysfunction/degeneration and subsequent parkinsonism. Supporting a pathogenic role for &#x3b1;-synuclein aggregates we have previously shown that LB purified from postmortem PD brains promote &#x3b1;-synuclein pathology and dopaminergic neurodegeneration when intracerebrally inoculated into wild-type mice. However, the pathogenic capacity of PD-derived peripheral &#x3b1;-synuclein aggregates remains unknown. Here we addressed this question using purified LB-type &#x3b1;-synuclein aggregates from postmortem PD stellate ganglia (SG), a paravertebral sympathetic ganglion that exhibits consistent and conspicuous Lewy pathology in all PD patients. In contrast to our previous findings using nigral LB extracts, intracerebral inoculation of SG-derived LB into mice did not trigger long-term nigrostriatal neurodegeneration nor &#x3b1;-synuclein pathology. The differential pathogenic capacities of central- and peripheral-derived &#x3b1;-synuclein aggregates appear independent of the absolute amount and basic biochemical properties of &#x3b1;-synuclein within these aggregates and may rely instead on differences in &#x3b1;-synuclein conformation and/or yet unrecognized brain region-specific intrinsic factors. Our results argue against a putative pathogenic capacity of peripheral &#x3b1;-synuclein aggregates to promote &#x3b1;-synuclein pathology in the brain, propagate between neuronal networks or induce neurodegeneration."
"Seeding and spread of beta-amyloid (A&#x3b2;) pathologies have been considered to be based on prion-like mechanisms. However, limited transmissibility of A&#x3b2; seeding activity upon peripheral exposure would represent a key difference to prions, not only in terms of pathogenesis but also in terms of potential transmission of disease. We partially characterized the seeded A&#x3b2; amyloidosis after intracerebral injection of various brain homogenates in APP/PS1 mice. One particularly seed-laden homogenate was selected to investigate the development of A&#x3b2; pathologies after intravenous exposure. We report here that a single intravenous injection of an Alzheimer disease patient's-brain extract into APP/PS1 recipient mice led to cerebral amyloid angiopathy within 180&#xa0;days post injection. Thus, vascular proteinopathies such as CAA are transmissible in mice via the intravenous route of peripheral exposure."
"Terminal complement complex deposition in endomysial capillaries detected by a C5b-9 immunostain is considered a diagnostic feature for dermatomyositis. However, we found widespread microvascular C5b-9 reactivity in a substantial subset of muscle biopsies with denervation changes, and in nerve biopsies of peripheral neuropathies, particularly in patients with diabetes. It is unclear whether the presence of C5b-9 deposition signifies active immune-mediated vascular injury that requires immune suppression therapy. We retrospectively identified 63 nerve biopsies in patients with a documented history of diabetes, 26 of which had concomitant muscle biopsies, as well as 54 control nerve biopsies in patients without a documented diabetes history, 18 of which had concomitant muscle biopsies. C5b-9 immunostain was performed on all cases. 87% of the nerve biopsies and 92% of the muscle biopsies from diabetic patients showed microvascular C5b-9 reactivity, compared to 34% and 50% in non-diabetic patients. The differences were statistically significant (p&#xa0;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001 for nerve and p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.002 for muscle). The C5b-9 reactivity was generally proportional to the extent of microvascular sclerosis in diabetic patients, but unrelated to inflammation or vasculitis. C5b-9 deposition in micro-vasculature in both muscle and nerve is therefore a common feature in patients with diabetic neuropathies and may have diagnostic utility. Precaution needs to be taken before using muscle capillary C5b-9 reactivity as evidence of myositis."
"Mechanisms underlying sex differences in cancer incidence are not defined but likely involve dimorphism (s) in tumor suppressor function at the cellular and organismal levels. As an example, sexual dimorphism in retinoblastoma protein (Rb) activity was shown to block transformation of female, but not male, murine astrocytes in which neurofibromin and p53 function was abrogated (GBM astrocytes). Correlated sex differences in gene expression in the murine GBM astrocytes were found to be highly concordant with sex differences in gene expression in male and female GBM patients, including in the expression of components of the Rb and p53 pathways. To define the basis of this phenomenon, we examined the functions of the cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, p16, p21 and p27 in murine GBM astrocytes under conditions that promote Rb-dependent growth arrest. We found that upon serum deprivation or etoposide-induced DNA damage, female, but not male GBM astrocytes, respond with increased p16 and p21 activity, and cell cycle arrest. In contrast, male GBM astrocytes continue to proliferate, accumulate chromosomal aberrations, exhibit enhanced clonogenic cell activity and in vivo tumorigenesis; all manifestations of broad sex differences in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair. Differences in tumorigenesis disappeared when female GBM astrocytes are also rendered null for p16 and p21. These data elucidate mechanisms underlying sex differences in cancer incidence and demonstrate sex-specific effects of cytotoxic and targeted therapeutics. This has critical implications for lab and clinical research."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is conceptualized as a progressive consequence of two hallmark pathological changes in grey matter: extracellular amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. However, over the past several years, neuroimaging studies have implicated micro- and macrostructural abnormalities in white matter in the risk and progression of AD, suggesting that in addition to the neuronal pathology characteristic of the disease, white matter degeneration and demyelination may be also important pathophysiological features. Here we review the evidence for white matter abnormalities in AD with a focus on myelin and oligodendrocytes, the only source of myelination in the central nervous system, and discuss the relationship between white matter changes and the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. We review several mechanisms such as ischemia, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, iron overload, A&#x3b2; toxicity and tauopathy, which could affect oligodendrocytes. We conclude that white matter abnormalities, and in particular myelin and oligodendrocytes, could be mechanistically important in AD pathology and could be potential treatment targets."
"Human familial prion diseases are associated with mutations at 34 different prion protein (PrP) amino acid residues. However, it is unclear whether infectious prions are found in all cases. Mutant PrP itself may be neurotoxic, or alternatively, PrP mutation might predispose to spontaneous formation of infectious PrP isoforms. Previous reports demonstrated transmission to animal models by human brain tissue expressing 7 different PrP mutations, but 3 other mutations were not transmissible. In the present work, we tested transmission using brain homogenates from patients expressing 3 untested PrP mutants: G131V, Y226X, and Q227X. Human brain homogenates were injected intracerebrally into tg66 transgenic mice overexpressing human PrP. Mice were followed for nearly 800&#xa0;days.From 593 to 762 dpi, 4 of 8 mice injected with Y226X brain had PrPSc detectable in brain by immunostaining, immunoblot, and PrP amyloid seeding activity assayed by RT-QuIC. From 531 to 784 dpi, 11 of 11&#xa0;G131V-injected mice had PrPSc deposition in brain, but none were positive by immunoblot or RT-QuIC assay. In contrast, from 529 to 798 dpi, no tg66 mice injected with Q227X brain had PrPSc or PrP amyloid seeding activity detectable by these methods. Y226X is the only one of 4 known PrP truncations associated with familial disease which has been shown to be transmissible. This transmission of prion infectivity from a patient expressing truncated human PrP may have implications for the spread and possible transmission of other aggregated truncated proteins in prion-like diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and tauopathies."
"Huntington disease (HD) is caused by the expression of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) bearing a polyglutamine expansion. In HD, mHTT accumulation is accompanied by a dysfunction in basal autophagy, which manifests as specific defects in cargo loading during selective autophagy. Here we show that the expression of mHTT resistant to proteolysis at the caspase cleavage site D586 (C6R mHTT) increases autophagy, which may be due to its increased binding to the autophagy adapter p62. This is accompanied by faster degradation of C6R mHTT in vitro and a lack of mHTT accumulation the C6R mouse model with age. These findings may explain the previously observed neuroprotective properties of C6R mHTT. As the C6R mutation cannot be easily translated into a therapeutic approach, we show that a scheduled feeding paradigm is sufficient to lower mHTT levels in YAC128 mice expressing cleavable mHTT. This is consistent with a previous model, where the presence of cleavable mHTT impairs basal autophagy, while fasting-induced autophagy remains functional. In HD, mHTT clearance and autophagy may become increasingly impaired as a function of age and disease stage, because of gradually increased activity of mHTT-processing enzymes. Our findings imply that mHTT clearance could be enhanced by a regulated dietary schedule that promotes autophagy."
"Synaptic dysfunction or loss in early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to be a major structural correlate of cognitive dysfunction. Early loss of episodic memory, which occurs at the early stage of AD, is closely associated with the progressive degeneration of medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures of which the transentorhinal cortex (TEC) is the first affected area. However, no ultrastructural studies have been performed in this region in human brain samples from AD patients. In the present study, we have performed a detailed three-dimensional (3D) ultrastructural analysis using focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM) to investigate possible synaptic alterations in the TEC of patients with AD. Surprisingly, the analysis of the density, morphological features and spatial distribution of synapses in the neuropil showed no significant differences between AD and control samples. However, light microscopy studies showed that cortical thickness of the TEC was severely reduced in AD samples, but there were no changes in the volume occupied by neuronal and glial cell bodies, blood vessels, and neuropil. Thus, the present results indicate that there is a dramatic loss of absolute number of synapses, while the morphology of synaptic junctions and synaptic spatial distribution are maintained. How these changes affect cognitive impairment in AD remains to be elucidated."
"All isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant solid neoplasms exhibit highly elevated levels of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG). Detection of 2HG in tumor tissues currently is performed by gas or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC- or LC-MS) or biochemical detection. While these methods are highly accurate, a considerable amount of time for tissue preparation and a relatively high amount of tissue is required for testing. We here present a rapid approach to detect 2HG in brain tumor tissue based on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization - time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). We analyzed 26 brain tumor samples with known IDH1 or IDH2 mutation and compared readouts to those from 28 brain tumor samples of wildtype IDH status. IDH mutant samples exhibited a clear positive signal for 2HG which was not observed in any of the IDH wildtype tumors. Our analytical pipeline allowed for 2HG detection in less than 5&#xa0;min. Data were validated by determining 2HG levels in all tissues with a biochemical assay. In conclusion, we developed a protocol for rapid detection of 2HG levels and illustrate the possibility to use MALDI-TOF for the detection of metabolites on frozen tissue sections in a diagnostic setting."
"Although the genetic causes for several rare, familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been identified, the etiology of the sporadic form of AD remains unclear. Here, we report a systems-level study of disease-associated proteome changes in human frontal cortex of sporadic AD patients using an integrated approach that combines mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics, differential expression analysis, and co-expression network analysis. Our analyses of 16 human brain tissues from AD patients and age-matched controls showed organization of the cortical proteome into a network of 24 biologically meaningful modules of co-expressed proteins. Of these, 5 modules are positively correlated to AD phenotypes with hub proteins that are up-regulated in AD, and 6 modules are negatively correlated to AD phenotypes with hub proteins that are down-regulated in AD. Our study generated a molecular blueprint of altered protein networks in AD brain and uncovered the dysregulation of multiple pathways and processes in AD brain, including altered proteostasis, RNA homeostasis, immune response, neuroinflammation, synaptic transmission, vesicular transport, cell signaling, cellular metabolism, lipid homeostasis, mitochondrial dynamics and function, cytoskeleton organization, and myelin-axon interactions. Our findings provide new insights into AD pathogenesis and suggest novel candidates for future diagnostic and therapeutic development."
"Muscle atrophy with weakness is a core feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that has long been attributed to motor neuron loss alone. However, several studies in ALS patients, and more so in animal models, have challenged this assumption with the latter providing direct evidence that muscle can play an active role in the disease. Here, we examined the possible role of cell autonomous pathology in 148 skeletal muscle samples from 57 ALS patients, identifying phosphorylated TAR DNA-binding protein (pTDP-43) inclusions in the muscle fibers of 19 patients (33.3%) and 24 tissue samples (16.2% of specimens). A muscle group-specific difference was identified with pTDP-43 pathology being significantly more common in axial (paraspinous, diaphragm) than appendicular muscles (P&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.0087). This pathology was not significantly associated with pertinent clinical, genetic (c9ALS) or nervous system pathologic data, suggesting it is not limited to any particular subgroup of ALS patients. Among 25 non-ALS muscle samples, pTDP-43 inclusions were seen only in the autophagy-related disorder inclusion body myositis (IBM) (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;4), where they were more diffuse than in positive ALS samples (P&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.007). As in IBM samples, pTDP-43 aggregates in ALS were p62/ sequestosome-1-positive, potentially indicating induction of autophagy. Phospho-TDP-43-positive ALS and IBM samples also showed significant up-regulation of TARDBP and SQSTM1 expression. These findings implicate axial skeletal muscle as an additional site of pTDP-43 pathology in some ALS patients, including sporadic and familial cases, which is deserving of further investigation."
"The amyloid cascade hypothesis posits that the initiating event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the aggregation and deposition of the &#x3b2;-amyloid (A&#x3b2;) peptide, which is a proteolytic cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Mounting evidence suggests that the formation and spread of prion-like A&#x3b2; aggregates during AD may contribute to disease progression. Inoculation of transgenic mice that overexpress APP with pre-formed A&#x3b2; aggregates results in the prion-like induction of cerebral A&#x3b2; deposition. To determine whether A&#x3b2; deposition can also be induced when physiological APP levels are present in the brain, we inoculated App<sup>NL-F</sup> mice, a knock-in model of AD that avoids potential artifacts associated with APP overexpression, with A&#x3b2; aggregates derived from the brains of AD patients or transgenic mice. In all cases, induced A&#x3b2; deposition was apparent in the corpus callosum, olfactory bulb, and meningeal blood vessels of inoculated mice at 130-150&#xa0;days post-inoculation, whereas uninoculated and buffer-inoculated animals exhibited minimal or no A&#x3b2; deposits at these ages. Interestingly, despite being predominantly composed of protease-resistant A&#x3b2;42 aggregates, the induced parenchymal A&#x3b2; deposits were largely diffuse and were unreactive to an amyloid-binding dye. These results demonstrate that APP overexpression is not a prerequisite for the prion-like induction of cerebral A&#x3b2; deposition. Accordingly, spreading of A&#x3b2; deposition may contribute to disease progression in AD patients."
"The complement system is a key driver of neuroinflammation. Activation of complement by all pathways, results in the formation of the anaphylatoxin C5a and the membrane attack complex (MAC). Both initiate pro-inflammatory responses which can contribute to neurological disease. In this study, we delineate the specific roles of C5a receptor signaling and MAC formation during the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-mediated neuroinflammation. MAC inhibition was achieved by subcutaneous administration of an antisense oligonucleotide specifically targeting murine C6 mRNA (5&#xa0;mg/kg). The C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) was inhibited with the C5a receptor antagonist PMX205 (1.5&#xa0;mg/kg). Both treatments were administered systemically and started after disease onset, at the symptomatic phase when lymphocytes are activated. We found that antisense-mediated knockdown of C6 expression outside the central nervous system prevented relapse of disease by impeding the activation of parenchymal neuroinflammatory responses, including the Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Furthermore, C6 antisense-mediated MAC inhibition protected from relapse-induced axonal and synaptic damage. In contrast, inhibition of C5aR1-mediated inflammation diminished expression of major pro-inflammatory mediators, but unlike C6 inhibition, it did not stop progression of neurological disability completely. Our study suggests that MAC is a key driver of neuroinflammation in this model, thereby MAC inhibition might be a relevant treatment for chronic neuroinflammatory diseases."
"Heterozygous mutations in glucocerebrosidase 1 (GBA1) are a major genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease and Dementia with Lewy bodies. Mutations in GBA1 leads to GBA1 enzyme deficiency, and GBA1-associated parkinsonism has an earlier age of onset and more progressive parkinsonism. To investigate a potential influence of GBA1 deficiency caused by mutations in GBA1 on the disease progression of PD, GBA1 mice carrying D409H knock-in mutation were crossbred with the human A53T (hA53T) &#x3b1;-synuclein transgenic mice. Here, we show that GBA1 enzyme activity plays a significant role in the hA53T &#x3b1;-synuclein induced &#x3b1;-synucleinopathy. The expression of D409H GBA1 markedly shortens the lifespan of hA53T &#x3b1;-synuclein transgenic mice. Moreover, D409H GBA1 expression exacerbates the formation of insoluble aggregates of &#x3b1;-synuclein, glial activation, neuronal degeneration, and motor abnormalities in the hA53T &#x3b1;-synuclein transgenic mice. Interestingly, the expression of D409H GBA1 results in the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of hA53T transgenic mice. Taken together, these results indicate that GBA1 deficiency due to D409H mutation affects the disease onset and course in hA53T &#x3b1;-synuclein transgenic mice. Therefore, strategies aimed to maintain GBA1 enzyme activity could be employed to develop an effective novel therapy for GBA1 linked-PD and related &#x3b1;-synucleinopathies."
"Degeneration of noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons occurs during the prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease and contributes to a variety of non-motor symptoms, e.g. depression, anxiety and REM sleep behavior disorder. This study was designed to establish the first locus coeruleus &#x3b1;-synucleinopathy mouse model, which should provide sufficient information about the time-course of noradrenergic neurodegeneration, replicate cardinal histopathological features of the human Parkinson's disease neuropathology and finally lead to robust histological markers, which are sufficient to assess the pathological changes in a quantitative and qualitative way. We show that targeted viral vector-mediated overexpression of human mutant A53T-&#x3b1;-synuclein in vivo in locus coeruleus neurons of wild-type mice resulted in progressive noradrenergic neurodegeneration over a time frame of 9&#xa0;weeks. Observed neuronal cell loss was accompanied by progressive &#x3b1;-synuclein phosphorylation, formation of proteinase K-resistant &#x3b1;-synuclein-aggregates, accumulation of Ubi-1- and p62-positive inclusions in microglia and induction of progressive micro- and astrogliosis. Apart from this local pathology, abundant &#x3b1;-synuclein-positive axons were found in locus coeruleus output regions, indicating rapid anterograde axonal transport of A53T-&#x3b1;-synuclein. Taken together, we present the first model of &#x3b1;-synucleinopathy in the murine locus coeruleus, replicating essential morphological features of human Parkinson's disease pathology. This new model may contribute to the research on prodromal Parkinson's disease, in respect to pathophysiology and the development of disease-modifying therapy."
"Astroyctes serve myriad functions but are especially critical in white matter tracts, where energy-demanding axons propagate action potentials great distances between neurons. Axonal dependence on astrocytes for even normal function accentuates the critical role astrocytes serve during disease. In glaucoma, the most common optic neuropathy, sensitivity to intraocular pressure (IOP) challenges RGC axons early, including degradation of anterograde transport to the superior colliculus (SC). Astrocyte remodeling presages overt axon degeneration in glaucoma and thus may present a therapeutic opportunity. Here we developed a novel metric to quantify organization of astrocyte processes in the optic nerve relative to axon degeneration in the DBA/2&#xa0;J hereditary mouse model of glaucoma. In early progression, as axons expand prior to loss, astrocyte processes become more parallel with migration to the nerve's edge without a change in overall coverage of the nerve. As axons degenerate, astrocyte parallelism diminishes with increased glial coverage and reinvasion of the nerve. In longitudinal sections through aged DBA/2&#xa0;J nerve, increased astrocyte parallelism reflected elevated levels of the astrocyte gap-junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43). In the distal nerve, increased Cx43 also indicated with a higher level of intact anterograde transport from retina to SC. Our results suggest that progression of axonopathy in the optic nerve involves astrocyte remodeling in two phases. In an early phase, astrocyte processes organize in parallel, likely through gap-junction coupling, while a later phase involves deterioration of organization as glial coverage increases and axons are lost."
"Misfolding and aggregation of tau protein are closely associated with the onset and progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). By interrogating IgG<sup>+</sup> memory B cells from asymptomatic donors with tau peptides, we have identified two somatically mutated V<sub>H</sub>5-51/V<sub>L</sub>4-1 antibodies. One of these, CBTAU-27.1, binds to the aggregation motif in the R3 repeat domain and blocks the aggregation of tau into paired helical filaments (PHFs) by sequestering monomeric tau. The other, CBTAU-28.1, binds to the N-terminal insert region and inhibits the spreading of tau seeds and mediates the uptake of tau aggregates into microglia by binding PHFs. Crystal structures revealed that the combination of V<sub>H</sub>5-51 and V<sub>L</sub>4-1 recognizes a common Pro-X<sub>n</sub>-Lys motif driven by germline-encoded hotspot interactions while the specificity and thereby functionality of the antibodies are defined by the CDR3 regions. Affinity improvement led to improvement in functionality, identifying their epitopes as new targets for therapy and prevention of AD."
"Oligodendrogliomas are primary human brain tumors with a characteristic 1p/19q co-deletion of important prognostic relevance, but little is known about the pathology of this chromosomal mutation. We developed a network-based approach to identify novel cancer gene candidates in the region of the 1p/19q co-deletion. Gene regulatory networks were learned from gene expression and copy number data of 178 oligodendrogliomas and further used to quantify putative impacts of differentially expressed genes of the 1p/19q region on cancer-relevant pathways. We predicted 8 genes with strong impact on signaling pathways and 14 genes with strong impact on metabolic pathways widespread across the region of the 1p/19 co-deletion. Many of these candidates (e.g. ELTD1, SDHB, SEPW1, SLC17A7, SZRD1, THAP3, ZBTB17) are likely to push, whereas others (e.g. CAP1, HBXIP, KLK6, PARK7, PTAFR) might counteract oligodendroglioma development. For example, ELTD1, a functionally validated glioblastoma oncogene located on 1p, was overexpressed. Further, the known glioblastoma tumor suppressor SLC17A7 located on 19q was underexpressed. Moreover, known epigenetic alterations triggered by mutated SDHB in paragangliomas suggest that underexpressed SDHB in oligodendrogliomas may support and possibly enhance the epigenetic reprogramming induced by the IDH-mutation. We further analyzed rarely observed deletions and duplications of chromosomal arms within oligodendroglioma subcohorts identifying putative oncogenes and tumor suppressors that possibly influence the development of oligodendroglioma subgroups. Our in-depth computational study contributes to a better understanding of the pathology of the 1p/19q co-deletion and other chromosomal arm mutations. This might open opportunities for functional validations and new therapeutic strategies."
"Nemaline myopathies are heterogeneous congenital muscle disorders causing skeletal muscle weakness and, in some cases, death soon after birth. Mutations in nebulin, encoding a large sarcomeric protein required for thin filament function, are responsible for approximately 50% of nemaline myopathy cases. Despite the severity of the disease there is no effective treatment for nemaline myopathy with limited research to develop potential therapies. Several supplements, including L-tyrosine, have been suggested to be beneficial and consequently self-administered by nemaline myopathy patients without any knowledge of their efficacy. We have characterized a zebrafish model for nemaline myopathy caused by a mutation in nebulin. These fish form electron-dense nemaline bodies and display reduced muscle function akin to the phenotypes observed in nemaline myopathy patients. We have utilized our zebrafish model to test and evaluate four treatments currently self-administered by nemaline myopathy patients to determine their ability to increase skeletal muscle function. Analysis of muscle pathology and locomotion following treatment with L-tyrosine, L-carnitine, taurine, or creatine revealed no significant improvement in skeletal muscle function emphasizing the urgency to develop effective therapies for nemaline myopathy."
"Genomic characterization has begun to redefine diagnostic classifications of cancers. However, it remains a challenge to infer disease phenotypes from genomic alterations alone. To help realize the promise of genomics, we have performed a quantitative proteomics investigation using Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC) and 41 tissue samples spanning the 4 genomically based subgroups of medulloblastoma and control cerebellum. We have identified and quantitated thousands of proteins across these groups and find that we are able to recapitulate the genomic subgroups based upon subgroup restricted and differentially abundant proteins while also identifying subgroup specific protein isoforms. Integrating our proteomic measurements with genomic data, we calculate a poor correlation between mRNA and protein abundance. Using EPIC 850&#xa0;k methylation array data on the same tissues, we also investigate the influence of copy number alterations and DNA methylation on the proteome in an attempt to characterize the impact of these genetic features on the proteome. Reciprocally, we are able to use the proteome to identify which genomic alterations result in altered protein abundance and thus are most likely to impact biology. Finally, we are able to assemble protein-based pathways yielding potential avenues for clinical intervention. From these, we validate the EIF4F cap-dependent translation pathway as a novel druggable pathway in medulloblastoma. Thus, quantitative proteomics complements genomic platforms to yield a more complete understanding of functional tumor biology and identify novel therapeutic targets for medulloblastoma."
"Several studies suggest that women have a higher risk to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) than men. In particular, the number of pregnancies was shown to be a risk factor for AD and women with several pregnancies on average had an earlier onset of the disease, thus making childbearing a risk factor. However, the impact of being pregnant on A&#x3b2; plaque pathology and adult neurogenesis still remains elusive. Postmortem analysis revealed that pregnant 5xFAD transgenic mice had significantly more A&#x3b2; plaques in the hippocampus from G10 onwards and that the number of Ki67 and DCX positive cells dramatically decreased during the postpartum period. Furthermore, 5&#xa0;months old 5xFAD transgenic mice that also nursed their offsprings for 4&#xa0;weeks had a similar A&#x3b2; plaque load than merely pregnant mice, indicating that pregnancy alone is sufficient to elevate A&#x3b2; plaque levels. Interestingly, housing in an enriched environment reduced the A&#x3b2; plaque load and vivified neurogenesis. Our results suggest that pregnancy alters A&#x3b2; plaque deposition in 5xFAD transgenic mice and diminishes the generation of newborn neurons. We conclude that pregnancy alone is sufficient to induce this phenotype that can be reversed upon environmental enrichment."
"Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase (LRRK2) are the most common cause of heritable Parkinson's disease (PD), and the most common mutations in LRRK2 lead to elevated kinase activity. For these reasons, inhibitors targeting LRRK2 have been the subject of intense research and development. However, it has been difficult to develop preclinical models that recapitulate PD-relevant LRRK2 phenotypes. The primary pathology in PD is the Lewy body (LB), which is a cytoplasmic aggregate of &#x3b1;-synuclein. The recent demonstration that LB-like aggregates of &#x3b1;-synuclein can be induced in primary neurons has provided a robust model for testing genetic modifiers of PD-relevant aggregation and neurodegeneration. In this study, we test the modulation of &#x3b1;-synuclein pathology by LRRK2 in primary neuron cultures using biochemistry and immunocytochemistry. We find that expression of familial mutant G2019S LRRK2 does not dramatically elevate the pathological burden of &#x3b1;-synuclein or neurodegeneration in neurons. We further test three LRRK2 inhibitors in two strains of wildtype neurons and find that even robust LRRK2 inhibition is insufficient to reduce &#x3b1;-synuclein pathology. LRRK2 inhibitors similarly had no effect in neurons with &#x3b1;-synuclein pathology seeded by human brain-derived pathological &#x3b1;-synuclein. Finally, we find that this lack of pathological modulation by LRRK2 was not confined to hippocampal neurons, but was also absent in midbrain dopaminergic neuron cultures. These data demonstrate that LRRK2 activity does not have more than minor effects on &#x3b1;-synuclein pathology in primary neurons, and more complex models may be needed to evaluate the ability of LRRK2 inhibitors to treat PD."
"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a universally fatal malignancy of the childhood central nervous system, with a median overall survival of 9-11&#xa0;months. We have previously shown that primary DIPG tissue contains numerous tumor-associated macrophages, and substantial work has demonstrated a significant pathological role for adult glioma-associated macrophages. However, work over the past decade has highlighted many molecular and genomic differences between pediatric and adult high-grade gliomas. Thus, we directly compared inflammatory characteristics of DIPG and adult glioblastoma (GBM). We found that the leukocyte (CD45+) compartment in primary DIPG tissue samples is predominantly composed of CD11b&#x2009;+&#x2009;macrophages, with very few CD3+ T-lymphocytes. In contrast, T-lymphocytes are more abundant in adult GBM tissue samples. RNA sequencing of macrophages isolated from primary tumor samples revealed that DIPG- and adult GBM-associated macrophages both express gene programs related to ECM remodeling and angiogenesis, but DIPG-associated macrophages express substantially fewer inflammatory factors than their adult GBM counterparts. Examining the secretome of glioma cells, we found that patient-derived DIPG cell cultures secrete markedly fewer cytokines and chemokines than patient-derived adult GBM cultures. Concordantly, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data indicates low to absent expression of chemokines and cytokines in DIPG. Together, these observations suggest that the inflammatory milieu of the DIPG tumor microenvironment is fundamentally different than adult GBM. The low intrinsic inflammatory signature of DIPG cells may contribute to the lack of lymphocytes and non-inflammatory phenotype of DIPG-associated microglia/macrophages. Understanding the glioma subtype-specific inflammatory milieu may inform the design and application of immunotherapy-based treatments."
"Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and the leading neurodegenerative cause of motor disability. Pathologic accumulation of aggregated alpha synuclein (AS) protein in brain, and imbalance in the nigrostriatal system due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra- pars compacta, are hallmark features in PD. AS aggregation and propagation are considered to trigger neurotoxic mechanisms in PD, including mitochondrial deficits and oxidative stress. The eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF2K) mediates critical regulation of dendritic mRNA translation and is a crucial molecule in diverse forms of synaptic plasticity. Here we show that eEF2K activity, assessed by immuonohistochemical detection of eEF2 phosphorylation on serine residue 56, is increased in postmortem PD midbrain and hippocampus. Induction of aggressive, AS-related motor phenotypes in a transgenic PD M83 mouse model also increased brain eEF2K expression and activity. In cultures of dopaminergic N2A cells, overexpression of wild-type human AS or the A53T mutant increased eEF2K activity. eEF2K inhibition prevented the cytotoxicity associated with AS overexpression in N2A cells by improving mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress. Furthermore, genetic deletion of the eEF2K ortholog efk-1 in C. elegans attenuated human A53T AS induced defects in behavioural assays reliant on dopaminergic neuron function. These data suggest a role for eEF2K activity in AS toxicity, and support eEF2K inhibition as a potential target in reducing AS-induced oxidative stress in PD."
"A hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic contributor to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Reduced expression of the C9ORF72 gene product has been proposed as a potential contributor to disease pathogenesis. Additionally, repetitive RNAs and dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), such as poly-GR, can be produced by this hexanucleotide expansion that disrupt a number of cellular processes, potentially contributing to neural degeneration. To better discern which of these mechanisms leads to disease-associated changes in patient brains, we analyzed gene expression data generated from the cortex and cerebellum. We found that transcripts encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs) regulated by the HSF1 transcription factor were significantly induced in C9ORF72-ALS/FTLD patients relative to both sporadic ALS/FTLD cases and controls. Treatment of human neurons with chemically synthesized DPRs was sufficient to activate a similar transcriptional response. Expression of GGGGCC repeats and also poly-GR in the brains of Drosophila lead to the upregulation of HSF1 and the same highly-conserved HSPs. Additionally, HSF1 was a modifier of poly-GR toxicity in Drosophila. Our results suggest that the expression of DPRs are associated with upregulation of HSF1 and activation of a heat shock response in C9ORF72-ALS/FTLD."
"Recent positron emission tomography (PET) studies have demonstrated the accumulation of tau PET tracer in the affected region of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) cases. To confirm the binding target of radiotracer in PSP, we performed an imaging-pathology correlation study in two autopsy-confirmed PSP patients who underwent [<sup>18</sup>F]THK5351 PET before death. One patient with PSP Richardson syndrome showed elevated tracer retention in the globus pallidus and midbrain. In a patient with PSP-progressive nonfluent aphasia, [<sup>18</sup>F]THK5351 retention also was observed in the cortical areas, particularly the temporal cortex. Neuropathological examination confirmed PSP in both patients. Regional [<sup>18</sup>F]THK5351 standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) in antemortem PET was significantly correlated with monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) level, reactive astrocytes density, and tau pathology at postmortem examination. In in vitro autoradiography, specific THK5351 binding was detected in the area of antemortem [<sup>18</sup>F]THK5351 retention, and binding was blocked completely by a reversible selective MAO-B inhibitor, lazabemide, in brain samples from these patients. In conclusion, [<sup>18</sup>F]THK5351 PET signals reflect MAO-B expressing reactive astrocytes, which may be associated with tau accumulation in PSP."
"With aging, the incidence of neuropathological hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases increases in the brains of cognitively healthy individuals. It is currently unclear to what extent these hallmarks associate with symptoms of disease at extreme ages. Forty centenarians from the 100-plus Study cohort donated their brain. Centenarians self-reported to be cognitively healthy at baseline, which was confirmed by a proxy. Objective ante-mortem measurements of cognitive performance were associated with the prevalence, distribution and quantity of age- and AD-related neuropathological hallmarks. Despite self-reported cognitive health, objective neuropsychological testing suggested varying levels of ante-mortem cognitive functioning. Post-mortem, we found that neuropathological hallmarks related to age and neurodegenerative diseases, such as A&#x3b2; and Tau pathology, as well as atherosclerosis, were abundantly present in most or all centenarians, whereas Lewy body and pTDP-43 pathology were scarce. We observed that increased pathology loads correlated across pathology subtypes, and an overall trend of higher pathology loads to associate with a lower cognitive test performance. This trend was carried especially by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD) and to a lesser extent by A&#x3b2;-associated pathologies. Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) specifically associated with lower executive functioning in the centenarians. In conclusion, we find that while the centenarians in this cohort escaped or delayed cognitive impairment until extreme ages, their brains reveal varying levels of disease-associated neuropathological hallmarks, some of which associate with cognitive performance."
"Parkinson's disease is diagnosed upon the presentation of motor symptoms, resulting from substantial degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. Prior to diagnosis, there is a lengthy prodromal stage in which non-motor symptoms, including olfactory deficits (hyposmia), develop. There is limited information about non-motor impairments and there is a need for directed research into these early pathogenic cellular pathways that precede extensive dopaminergic death in the midbrain. The protein tau has been identified as a genetic risk factor in the development of sporadic PD. Tau knockout mice have been reported as an age-dependent model of PD, and this study has demonstrated that they develop motor deficits at 15-months-old. We have shown that at 7-month-old tau knockout mice present with an overt hyposmic phenotype. This olfactory deficit correlates with an accumulation of &#x3b1;-synuclein, as well as autophagic impairment, in the olfactory bulb. This pathological feature becomes apparent in the striatum and substantia nigra of 15-month-old tau knockout mice, suggesting the potential for a spread of disease. Initial primary cell culture experiments have demonstrated that ablation of tau results in the release of &#x3b1;-synuclein enriched exosomes, providing a potential mechanism for disease spread. These alterations in &#x3b1;-synuclein level as well as a marked autophagy impairment in the tau knockout primary cells recapitulate results seen in the animal model. These data implicate a pathological role for tau in early Parkinson's disease."
"Differentiated neurons established via iPSCs from patients that suffer from familial Parkinson's disease (PD) have allowed insights into the mechanisms of neurodegeneration. In the larger cohort of patients with sporadic PD, iPSC based information on disease specific cellular phenotypes is rare. We asked whether differences may be present on genomic and epigenomic levels and performed a comprehensive transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis of fibroblasts, iPSCs and differentiated neuronal cells of sporadic PD-patients and controls. We found that on mRNA level, although fibroblasts and iPSCs are largely indistinguishable, differentiated neuronal cells of sporadic PD patients show significant alterations enriched in pathways known to be involved in disease aetiology, like the CREB-pathway and the pathway regulating PGC1&#x3b1;. Moreover, miRNAs and piRNAs/piRNA-like molecules are largely differentially regulated in cells and post-mortem tissue samples between control- and PD-patients. The most striking differences can be found in piRNAs/piRNA-like molecules, with SINE- and LINE-derived piRNAs highly downregulated in a disease specific manner. We conclude that neuronal cells derived from sporadic PD-patients help to elucidate novel disease mechanisms and provide relevant insight into the epigenetic landscape of sporadic Parkinson's disease as particularly regulated by small RNAs."
"Aggregation of tau protein and spreading of tau aggregates are pivotal pathological processes in a range of neurological disorders. Accumulating evidence suggests that immunotherapy targeting tau may be a viable therapeutic strategy. We have previously described the isolation of antibody CBTAU-22.1 from the memory B-cell repertoire of healthy human donors. CBTAU-22.1 was shown to specifically bind a disease-associated phosphorylated epitope in the C-terminus of tau (Ser<sup>422</sup>) and to be able to inhibit the spreading of pathological tau aggregates from P301S spinal cord lysates in vitro, albeit with limited potency. Using a combination of rational design and random mutagenesis we have derived a variant antibody with improved affinity while maintaining the specificity of the parental antibody. This affinity improved antibody showed greatly enhanced potency in a cell-based immunodepletion assay using paired helical filaments (PHFs) derived from human Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain tissue. Moreover, the affinity improved antibody limits the in vitro aggregation propensity of full length tau species specifically phosphorylated at position 422 produced by employing a native chemical ligation approach. Together, these results indicate that in addition to being able to inhibit the spreading of pathological tau aggregates, the matured antibody can potentially also interfere with the nucleation of tau which is believed to be the first step of the pathogenic process. Finally, the functionality in a P301L transgenic mice co-injection model highlights the therapeutic potential of human antibody dmCBTAU-22.1."
"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is heterogeneous in clinical presentation, neuropathological characteristics and genetics. An expanded GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of both FTLD and motor neuron disease (MND). Dipeptide repeat polymers (DPR) are generated through repeat-associated non-ATG translation, and they aggregate in neuronal inclusions with a distribution distinct from that of TDP-43 pathology. Recent studies from animal and cell culture models suggest that DPR might be toxic, but that toxicity may differ for specific DPR. Arginine containing DPR (poly-GR and poly-PR) have the greatest toxicity and are less frequent than other DPR (poly-GP, poly-GA). A unique feature of arginine-containing DPR is their potential for post-translational modification by methyl-transferases, which produces methylarginine DPR. In this report, we explored the relationship of DPR and methylarginine to markers of neurodegeneration using quantitative digital microscopic methods in 40 patients with C9ORF72 mutations and one of three different clinicopathologic phenotypes, FTLD, FTLD-MND or MND. We find that density and distribution of poly-GR inclusions are different from poly-GA and poly-GP inclusions. We also demonstrate colocalization of poly-GR with asymmetrical dimethylarginine (aDMA) immunoreactivity in regions with neurodegeneration. Differences in aDMA were also noted by clinical phenotype. FTLD-MND had the highest burden of poly-GR pathology compared to FTLD and MND, while FTLD-MND had higher burden of aDMA than FTLD. The results suggest that poly-GR pathology is associated with toxicity and neurodegeneration. It remains to be determined if dimethylarginine modification of poly-GR could contribute to its toxicity."
"Tau is known for its pathological role in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Tau is found in many subcellular compartments such as the cytosol and the nucleus. Although its normal role in microtubule binding is well established, its nuclear role is still unclear. Here, we reveal that tau localises to the nucleolus in undifferentiated and differentiated neuroblastoma cells (SHSY5Y), where it associates with TIP5, a key player in heterochromatin stability and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcriptional repression. Immunogold labelling on human brain sample confirms the physiological relevance of this finding by showing tau within the nucleolus colocalises with TIP5. Depletion of tau results in an increase in rDNA transcription with an associated decrease in heterochromatin and DNA methylation, suggesting that under normal conditions tau is involved in silencing of the rDNA. Cellular stress induced by glutamate causes nucleolar stress associated with the redistribution of nucleolar non-phosphorylated tau, in a similar manner to fibrillarin, and nuclear upsurge of phosphorylated tau (Thr231) which doesn't colocalise with fibrillarin or nucleolar tau. This suggests that stress may impact on different nuclear tau species. In addition to involvement in rDNA transcription, nucleolar non-phosphorylated tau also undergoes stress-induced redistribution&#xa0;similar to many nucleolar proteins."
"One of the earliest pathological features characterizing Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the loss of dendritic spines. Among the many factors potentially mediating this loss of neuronal connectivity, the contribution of Rho-GTPases is of particular interest. This family of proteins has been known for years as a key regulator of actin cytoskeleton remodeling. More recent insights have indicated how its complex signaling might be triggered also in pathological conditions. Here, we showed that the Rho-GTPase family member Rac1 levels decreased in the frontal cortex of AD patients compared to non-demented controls. Also, Rac1 increased in plasma samples of AD patients with Mini-Mental State Examination &lt;&#x2009;18 compared to age-matched non demented controls. The use of different constitutively active peptides allowed us to investigate in vitro Rac1 specific signaling. Its activation increased the processing of amyloid precursor protein and induced the translocation of SET from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, resulting in tau hyperphosphorylation at residue pT181. Notably, Rac1 was abnormally activated in the hippocampus of 6-week-old 3xTg-AD mice. However, the total protein levels decreased at 7-months. A rescue strategy based on the intranasal administration of Rac1 active peptide at 6.5&#xa0;months prevented dendritic spine loss. This data suggests the intriguing possibility of a dual role of Rac1 according to the different stages of the pathology. In an initial stage, Rac1 deregulation might represent a triggering co-factor due to the direct effect on A&#x3b2; and tau. However, at a later stage of the pathology, it might represent a potential therapeutic target due to the beneficial effect on spine dynamics."
"Using mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) from a transgenic CD11c promoter we found that a controlled optic nerve crush (ONC) injury attracted GFP<sup>hi</sup> retinal myeloid cells to the dying retinal ganglion cells and their axons. However, the origin of these retinal myeloid cells was uncertain. In this study we use transgenic mice in conjunction with ONC, partial and full optic nerve transection (ONT), and parabiosis to determine the origin of injury induced retinal myeloid cells. Analysis of parabiotic mice and fate mapping showed that responding retinal myeloid cells were not derived from circulating macrophages and that GFP<sup>hi</sup> myeloid cells could be derived from GFP<sup>lo</sup> microglia. Comparison of optic nerve to retina following an ONC showed a much greater concentration of GFP<sup>hi</sup> cells and GFP<sup>lo</sup> microglia in the optic nerve. Optic nerve injury also induced Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells in the optic nerve but not in the retina. Comparison of the retinal myeloid cell response after full versus partial ONT revealed fewer GFP<sup>hi</sup> cells and GFP<sup>lo</sup> microglia in the retina following a full ONT despite it being a more severe injury, suggesting that full transection of the optic nerve can block the migration of responding myeloid cells to the retina. Our results suggest that the optic nerve can be a reservoir for activated microglia and other retinal myeloid cells in the retina following optic nerve injury."
"Zika virus (ZIKV) became a global threat due to its unprecedented outbreak and its association with congenital malformations such as microcephaly in developing fetuses and neonates. There are currently no effective vaccines or drugs available for the prevention or treatment of ZIKV infection. Although multiple vaccine platforms have been established, their effectiveness in preventing congenital microcephaly has not been addressed. Herein, we tested a subunit vaccine containing the 450 amino acids at the N-terminus of the ZIKV envelope protein (E90) in mouse models for either in utero or neonatal ZIKV infection. In one model, embryos of vaccinated dams were challenged with a contemporary ZIKV strain at embryonic day 13.5. The other model infects neonatal mice from vaccinated dams by direct injection of ZIKV into the developing brains. The vaccine led to a substantial reduction of ZIKV-infected cells measured in the brains of fetal or suckling mice, and successfully prevented the onset of microcephaly compared to unvaccinated controls. Furthermore, E90 could protect mice from ZIKV infection even at 140&#xa0;days post-immunization. This work directly demonstrates that immunization of pregnant mice protects the developing brains of offspring both in utero and in the neonatal period from subsequent ZIKV infection and microcephaly. It also supports the further development of the E90 subunit vaccine towards clinical trials."
"The development of insoluble, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of the microtubule-associated protein tau is a defining feature of tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accumulating evidence suggests that tau pathology co-localizes with RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that are known markers for stress granules (SGs). Here we used proteomics to determine how the network of tau binding proteins changes with disease in the rTg4510 mouse, and then followed up with immunohistochemistry to identify RNA binding proteins that co-localize with tau pathology. The tau interactome networks revealed striking disease-related changes in interactions between tau and a multiple RBPs, and biochemical fractionation studies demonstrated that many of these proteins including hnRNPA0, EWSR1, PABP and RPL7 form insoluble aggregates as tau pathology develops. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse and human brain tissues suggest a model of evolving pathological interaction, in which RBPs co-localize with pathological phospho-tau but occur adjacent to larger pathological tau inclusions. We suggest a model in which tau initially interacts with RBPs in small complexes, but evolves into isolated aggregated inclusions as tau pathology matures."
"Glioblastoma (GB) is the most frequent primary brain tumor in adults with a dismal prognosis despite aggressive treatment including surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy with the alkylating agent temozolomide. Thus far, the successful implementation of the concept of targeted therapy where a drug targets a selective alteration in cancer cells was mainly limited to model diseases with identified genetic drivers. One of the most commonly altered oncogenic drivers of GB and therefore plausible therapeutic target is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Trials targeting this signaling cascade, however, have been negative, including the phase III OSAG 101-BSA-05 trial. This highlights the need for further patient selection to identify subgroups of GB with true EGFR-dependency. In this retrospective analysis of treatment-na&#xef;ve samples of the OSAG 101-BSA-05 trial cohort, we identify the EGFR signaling activity markers phosphorylated PRAS40 and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 as predictive markers for treatment efficacy of the EGFR-blocking antibody nimotuzumab in MGMT promoter unmethylated GBs. Considering the total trial population irrespective of MGMT status, a clear trend towards a survival benefit from nimotuzumab was already detectable when tumors had above median levels of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6. These results could constitute a basis for further investigations of nimotuzumab or other EGFR- and downstream signaling inhibitors in selected patient cohorts using the reported criteria as candidate predictive biomarkers."
"Microglia are brain immune cells that constantly survey their environment to maintain homeostasis. Enhanced microglial reactivity and proliferation are typical hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. Whether specific disease-linked microglial subsets exist during the entire course of neurodegeneration, including the recovery phase, is currently unclear. Taking a single-cell RNA-sequencing approach in a susceptibility gene-free model of nerve injury, we identified a microglial subpopulation that upon acute neurodegeneration shares a conserved gene regulatory profile compared to previously reported chronic and destructive neurodegeneration transgenic mouse models. Our data also revealed rapid shifts in gene regulation that defined microglial subsets at peak and resolution of neurodegeneration. Finally, our discovery of a unique transient microglial subpopulation at the onset of recovery may provide novel targets for modulating microglia-mediated restoration of brain health."
"Tau, the main component of the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), is an attractive target for immunotherapy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. MC1/Alz50 are currently the only antibodies targeting a disease-specific conformational modification of tau. Passive immunization experiments using intra-peritoneal injections have previously shown that MC1 is effective at reducing tau pathology in the forebrain of tau transgenic JNPL3 mice. In order to reach a long-term and sustained brain delivery, and avoid multiple injection protocols, we tested the efficacy of the single-chain variable fragment of MC1 (scFv-MC1) to reduce tau pathology in the same animal model, with focus on brain regional differences. ScFv-MC1 was cloned into an AAV delivery system and was directly injected into the hippocampus of adult JNPL3 mice. Specific promoters were employed to selectively target neurons or astrocytes for scFv-MC1 expression. ScFv-MC1 was able to decrease soluble, oligomeric and insoluble tau species, in our model. The effect was evident in the cortex, hippocampus and hindbrain. The astrocytic machinery appeared more efficient than the neuronal, with significant reduction of pathology in areas distant from the site of injection. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that an anti-tau conformational scFv antibody, delivered directly into the mouse adult brain, is able to reduce pathological tau, providing further insight into the nature of immunotherapy strategies."
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating and fatal motor neuron disease. Diagnosis typically occurs in the fifth decade of life and the disease progresses rapidly leading to death within ~&#x2009;2-5 years of symptomatic onset. There is no cure, and the few available treatments offer only a modest extension in patient survival. A protein central to ALS is the nuclear RNA/DNA-binding protein, TDP-43. In &gt;&#x2009;95% of ALS patients, TDP-43 is cleared from the nucleus and forms phosphorylated protein aggregates in the cytoplasm of affected neurons and glia. We recently defined that poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) activity regulates TDP-43-associated toxicity. PAR is a posttranslational modification that is attached to target proteins by PAR polymerases (PARPs). PARP-1 and PARP-2 are the major enzymes that are active in the nucleus. Here, we uncovered that the motor neurons of the ALS spinal cord were associated with elevated nuclear PAR, suggesting elevated PARP activity. Veliparib, a small-molecule inhibitor of nuclear PARP-1/2, mitigated the formation of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates in mammalian cells. In primary spinal-cord cultures from rat, Veliparib also inhibited TDP-43-associated neuronal death. These studies uncover that PAR activity is misregulated in the ALS spinal cord, and a small-molecular inhibitor of PARP-1/2 activity may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of ALS and related disorders associated with abnormal TDP-43 homeostasis."
"Accumulating evidence suggests that the lesions&#xa0;of&#xa0;Parkinson's disease (PD) expand due to transneuronal&#xa0;spreading of fibrils composed of misfolded alpha-synuclein (a-syn), over the course of 5-10&#xa0;years. However, the precise mechanisms and the processes underlying the spread of these fibril seeds have&#xa0;not been clarified&#xa0;in vivo. Here, we investigated the speed of a-syn transmission, which has not been a focus of previous a-syn transmission experiments, and whether a-syn pathologies spread in a neural circuit-dependent&#xa0;manner in the mouse brain. We injected&#xa0;a-syn preformed fibrils (PFFs), which are seeds for the propagation of&#xa0;a-syn&#xa0;deposits,&#xa0;either before or after callosotomy,&#xa0;to&#xa0;disconnect bilateral hemispheric connections. In mice that underwent callosotomy before the injection, the&#xa0;propagation of a-syn pathology to the contralateral hemisphere was clearly reduced. In contrast, mice that underwent&#xa0;callosotomy 24&#xa0;h after a-syn PFFs injection showed a-syn pathology similar to that seen in mice without callosotomy. These&#xa0;results suggest that a-syn&#xa0;seeds are rapidly disseminated through neuronal circuits immediately after seed injection, in a prion-like seeding experiment in vivo, although it is believed that clinical a-syn pathologies take years to spread throughout the brain. In addition, we found that botulinum toxin B blocked the transsynaptic transmission of a-syn seeds by specifically inactivating the synaptic vesicle fusion machinery. This study offers a novel concept regarding a-syn propagation, based on the Braak hypothesis, and also cautions that experimental transmission systems may be examining a unique type of transmission, which differs from the clinical disease state."
"Cancer cells have altered cellular metabolism. Mutations in genes associated with key metabolic pathways (e.g., isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2, IDH1/IDH2) are important drivers of cancer, including central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Therefore, we hypothesized that the abnormal metabolic state of CNS cancer cells leads to abnormal levels of metabolites in the CSF, and different CNS cancer types are associated with specific changes in the levels of CSF metabolites. To test this hypothesis, we used mass spectrometry to analyze 129 distinct metabolites in CSF samples from patients without a history of cancer (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8) and with a variety of CNS tumor types (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;23) (i.e., glioma IDH-mutant, glioma-IDH wildtype, metastatic lung cancer and metastatic breast cancer). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis shows tumor-specific metabolic signatures that facilitate differentiation of tumor type from CSF analysis. We identified differences in the abundance of 43 metabolites between CSF from control patients and the CSF of patients with primary or metastatic CNS tumors. Pathway analysis revealed alterations in various metabolic pathways (e.g., glycine, choline and methionine degradation, dipthamide biosynthesis and glycolysis pathways, among others) between IDH-mutant and IDH-wildtype gliomas. Moreover, patients with IDH-mutant gliomas demonstrated higher levels of D-2-hydroxyglutarate in the CSF, in comparison to patients with other tumor types, or controls. This study demonstrates that analysis of CSF metabolites can be a clinically useful tool for diagnosing and monitoring patients with primary or metastatic CNS tumors."
"While hypoxic pre-conditioning protects against neurological disease the underlying mechanisms have yet to be fully defined. As chronic mild hypoxia (CMH, 10% O<sub>2</sub>) triggers profound vascular remodeling in the central nervous system (CNS), the goal of this study was to examine the protective potential of hypoxic pre-conditioning in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis (MS) and then determine how CMH influences vascular integrity and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms during EAE. We found that mice exposed to CMH at the same time as EAE induction were strongly protected against the development of EAE progression, as assessed both at the clinical level and at the histopathological level by reduced levels of inflammatory leukocyte infiltration, vascular breakdown and demyelination. Mechanistically, our studies indicate that CMH protects, at least in part, by enhancing several properties of blood vessels that contribute to vascular integrity, including reduced expression of the endothelial activation molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, maintained expression of endothelial tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin, and upregulated expression of the leukocyte inhibitory protein laminin-111 in the vascular basement membrane. Taken together, these data suggest that optimization of BBB integrity is an important mechanism underlying the protective effect of hypoxic pre-conditioning."
"The human complement system is represents the main effector arm of innate immunity and its ambivalent function in cancer has been subject of ongoing dispute. Glioma stem-like cells (GSC) residing in specific niches within glioblastomas (GBM) are capable of self-renewal and tumor proliferation. Recent data are indicative of the influence of the complement system on the maintenance of these cells. It appears that the role of the complement system in glial tumorigenesis, particularly its influence on GSC niches and GSC maintenance, is significant and warrants further exploration for therapeutic interventions."
"Diffuse gliomas are classified according to the 2016 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System, which now defines entities by both histology and molecular features. Somatostatin receptor subtype 2A (SSTR2A) expression has been reported in various solid tumors as associated with favorable outcomes. Its expression has been reported in gliomas with uncertain results regarding its prognostic value. The objective of this study was to assess the prognostic impact of SSTR2A protein expression in a large cohort of grade III and IV gliomas classified according to the updated 2016 WHO classification. We further validated our result with an independent cohort of low grade glioma using dataset generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network.We analyzed clinical and molecular data from 575 patients. SSTR2A protein expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. High expression of SSTR2A protein associated with the anaplastic oligodendroglioma IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted subgroup (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Among these tumors, SSTR2A protein expression was significantly associated with a lower proliferative index, the absence of microvascular proliferation and the absence of necrosis (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Furthermore SSTR2A protein expression associated with better overall survival (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007) and progression-free survival (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01) in both univariate and multivariate analysis when adjusted by the age, the presence of necrosis and the mitotic index. Similar results were obtained regarding SSTR2 mRNA expression in the TCGA low grade glioma, subtype IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted, dataset.SSTR2A might represent an attractive biomarker and therapeutic target in anaplastic oligodendroglioma IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted specific subgroup. Understanding the implicated molecular pathways may represent a step forward to improve therapeutic approaches."
"Parkinson's disease (PD) patients often suffer from non-motor symptoms like sleep dysregulation, mood disturbances or circadian rhythms dysfunction. The melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells are involved in the control and regulation of these processes and may be affected in PD, as other retinal and visual implications have been described in the disease. Number and morphology of human melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in eyes from donors with PD or control. The Sholl number of intersections, the number of branches, and the number of terminals from the Sholl analysis were significantly reduced in PD melanopsin ganglion cells. Also, the density of these cells significantly decreased in PD compared to controls. Degeneration and impairment of the retinal melanopsin system may affect to sleep and circadian dysfunction reported in PD pathology, and its protection or stimulation may lead to better disease prospect and global quality of life of patients."
"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14) is a subtype of the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias that is characterized by slowly progressive cerebellar dysfunction and neurodegeneration. SCA14 is caused by mutations in the PRKCG gene, encoding protein kinase C gamma (PKC&#x3b3;). Despite the identification of 40 distinct disease-causing mutations in PRKCG, the pathological mechanisms underlying SCA14 remain poorly understood. Here we report the molecular neuropathology of SCA14 in post-mortem cerebellum and in human patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carrying two distinct SCA14 mutations in the C1 domain of PKC&#x3b3;, H36R and H101Q. We show that endogenous expression of these mutations results in the cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of PKC&#x3b3; in both patient iPSCs and cerebellum. PKC&#x3b3; aggregates were not efficiently targeted for degradation. Moreover, mutant PKC&#x3b3; was found to be hyper-activated, resulting in increased substrate phosphorylation. Together, our findings demonstrate that a combination of both, loss-of-function and gain-of-function mechanisms are likely to underlie the pathogenesis of SCA14, caused by mutations in the C1 domain of PKC&#x3b3;. Importantly, SCA14 patient iPSCs were found to accurately recapitulate pathological features observed in post-mortem SCA14 cerebellum, underscoring their potential as relevant disease models and their promise as future drug discovery tools."
Figure&#xa0;6 of the original publication [1] contained an error in the Wavenumber in panels B and C. The wavenumbers 1616 (Cm-1) in panels B and C should have been 1516 (cm-1). The updated figure has been published in this correction article; the original article has been updated.
"Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) is a commonly reported neurotoxic side effect of chemotherapy, occurring in up to 75% cancer patients. CICI manifests as decrements in working memory, executive functioning, attention, and processing speed, and greatly interferes with patients' daily performance and quality of life. Currently no treatment for CICI has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. We show here that treatment with a brain-penetrating histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitor for two weeks was sufficient to fully reverse cisplatin-induced cognitive impairments in male mice, as demonstrated in the Y-maze test of spontaneous alternation, the novel object/place recognition test, and the puzzle box test. Normalization of cognitive impairment was associated with reversal of cisplatin-induced synaptosomal mitochondrial deficits and restoration of synaptic integrity. Mechanistically, cisplatin induced deacetylation of the microtubule protein &#x3b1;-tubulin and hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. These cisplatin-induced changes were reversed by HDAC6 inhibition. Our data suggest that inhibition of HDAC6 restores microtubule stability and reverses tau phosphorylation, leading to normalization of synaptosomal mitochondrial function and synaptic integrity and thereby to reversal of CICI. Remarkably, our results indicate that short-term daily treatment with the HDAC6 inhibitor was sufficient to achieve prolonged reversal of established behavioral, structural and functional deficits induced by cisplatin. Because the beneficial effects of HDAC6 inhibitors as add-ons to cancer treatment have been demonstrated in clinical trials, selective targeting of HDAC6 with brain-penetrating inhibitors appears a promising therapeutic approach for reversing chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity while enhancing tumor control."
"Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a neuropathology with unknown cause characterised by gait impairment, cognitive decline and ventriculomegaly. These patients often present comorbidity with Alzheimer's disease (AD), including AD pathological hallmarks such as amyloid plaques mainly consisting of amyloid &#x3b2;-peptide and neurofibrillary tangles consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Even though some of the molecular mechanisms behind AD are well described, little is known about iNPH. Several studies have reported that mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contact sites (MERCS) regulate amyloid &#x3b2;-peptide metabolism and conversely that amyloid &#x3b2;-peptide can influence the number of MERCS. MERCS have also been shown to be dysregulated in several neurological pathologies including AD.In this study we have used transmission electron microscopy and show, for the first time, several mitochondria contact sites including MERCS in human brain biopsies. These unique human brain samples were obtained during neurosurgery from 14 patients that suffer from iNPH. Three of these 14 patients presented comorbidities with other dementias: one patient with AD, one with AD and vascular dementia and one patient with Lewy body dementia. Furthermore, we report that the numbers of MERCS are increased in biopsies obtained from patients diagnosed with dementia. Moreover, the presence of both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles correlates with decreased contact length between endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, while amyloid plaques alone do not seem to affect endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria apposition. Interestingly, we report a significant positive correlation between the number of MERCS and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid amyloid &#x3b2;-peptide&#xa0;levels, as well as with increasing age of iNPH patients."
"Astrocyte reactivity and neuroinflammation are hallmarks of CNS pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the specific role of reactive astrocytes is still debated. This controversy may stem from the fact that most strategies used to modulate astrocyte reactivity and explore its contribution to disease outcomes have only limited specificity. Moreover, reactive astrocytes are now emerging as heterogeneous cells and all types of astrocyte reactivity may not be controlled efficiently by such strategies.Here, we used cell type-specific approaches in vivo and identified the JAK2-STAT3 pathway, as necessary and sufficient for the induction and maintenance of astrocyte reactivity. Modulation of this cascade by viral gene transfer in mouse astrocytes efficiently controlled several morphological and molecular features of reactivity. Inhibition of this pathway in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease improved three key pathological hallmarks by reducing amyloid deposition, improving spatial learning and restoring synaptic deficits.In conclusion, the JAK2-STAT3 cascade operates as a master regulator of astrocyte reactivity in vivo. Its inhibition offers new therapeutic opportunities for Alzheimer's disease."
"Pompe disease, which is due to acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency, is characterized by skeletal muscle dysfunction attributed to the accumulation of glycogen-filled lysosomes and autophagic buildup. Despite the extensive tissue damages, a failure of satellite cell (SC) activation and lack of muscle regeneration have been reported in patients. However, the origin of this defective program is unknown. Additionally, whether these deficits occur gradually over the disease course is unclear. Using a longitudinal pathophysiological study of two muscles in a Pompe mouse model, here, we report that the enzymatic defect results in a premature saturating glycogen overload and a high number of enlarged lysosomes. The muscles gradually display profound remodeling as the number of autophagic vesicles, centronucleated fibers, and split fibers increases and larger fibers are lost. Only a few regenerated fibers were observed regardless of age, although the SC pool was preserved. Except for the early age, during which higher numbers of activated SCs and myoblasts were observed, no myogenic commitment was observed in response to the damage. Following in vivo injury, we established that muscle retains regenerative potential, demonstrating that the failure of SC participation in repair is related to an activation signal defect. Altogether, our findings provide new insight into the pathophysiology of Pompe disease and highlight that the activation signal defect of SCs compromises muscle repair, which could be related to the abnormal energetic supply following autophagic flux impairment."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, devastating neurodegenerative brain disorder characterized by the loss of neurons and subsequent cognitive decline. Despite considerable progress in the understanding of the pathophysiology of AD, the precise molecular mechanisms that cause the disease remain elusive. By now, there is ample evidence that activated microglia have a critical role in the initiation and progression of AD. The present study describes the identification of Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB) as a novel AD-related factor in both transgenic mice and sporadic AD patients by expression profiling, immunohistochemistry and ELISA measurements. We show that GPNMB levels increase in an age-dependent manner in transgenic AD models showing profound cerebral neuron loss and demonstrate that GPNMB co-localizes with a distinct population of IBA1-positive microglia cells that cluster around amyloid plaques. Our data further indicate that GPNMB is part of a microglia activation state that is only present under neurodegenerative conditions and that is characterized by the up-regulation of a subset of genes including TREM2, APOE and CST7. In agreement, we provide in vitro evidence that soluble A&#x3b2; has a direct effect on GPNMB expression in an immortalized microglia cell line. Importantly, we show for the first time that GPNMB is elevated in brain samples and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of sporadic AD patients when compared to non-demented controls.The current findings indicate that GPNMB represents a novel disease-associated marker that appears to play a role in the neuroinflammatory response of AD."
"TERT promoter (TERTp) mutations are found in the majority of World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV adult IDH wild-type glioblastoma (IDH-wt GBM). Here, we characterized the subset of IDH-wt GBMs that do not have TERTp mutations. In a cohort of 121 adult grade IV gliomas, we identified 109 IDH-wt GBMs, after excluding 11 IDH-mutant cases and one H3F3A -mutant case. Within the IDH-wt cases, 16 cases (14.7%) were TERTp wild-type (TERTp-wt). None of the 16 had BRAF V600E or H3F3A G34 hotspot mutations. When compared to TERTp mutants, patients with TERTp-wt GBMs, were significantly younger at first diagnosis (53.2&#xa0;years vs. 60.7&#xa0;years, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0096), and were more frequently found to have cerebellar location (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0027). Notably, 9 of 16 (56%) of TERTp-wt GBMs contained a PIK3CA or PIK3R1 mutation, while only 16/93 (17%) of TERTp-mutant GBMs harbored these alterations (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0018). As expected, 8/16 (50%) of TERTp-wt GBMs harbored mutations in the BAF complex gene family (ATRX, SMARCA4, SMARCB1, and ARID1A), compared with only 8/93 (9%) of TERTp-mutant GBMs (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0003). Mutations in BAF complex and PI3K pathway genes co-occurred more frequently in TERTp-wt GBMs (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0002), an association that has been observed in other cancers, suggesting a functional interaction indicative of a distinct pathway of gliomagenesis. Overall, our finding highlights heterogeneity within WHO-defined IDH wild-type GBMs and enrichment of the TERTp-wt subset for BAF/PI3K-altered tumors, potentially comprising a distinct clinical subtype of gliomas."
"Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is the most common causative gene for autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD) and is also known to be a susceptibility gene for sporadic PD. Although clinical symptoms with LRRK2 mutations are similar to those in sporadic PD, their pathologies are heterogeneous and include nigral degeneration with abnormal inclusions containing alpha-synuclein, tau, TAR DNA-binding protein 43, and ubiquitin, or pure nigral degeneration with no protein aggregation pathologies. We discovered two families harboring heterozygous and homozygous c.4332&#xa0;G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A; p.R1441H in LRRK2 with consanguinity, sharing a common founder. They lived in the city of Makurazaki, located in a rural area of the southern region, the Kagoshima prefecture, in Kyushu, Japan. All patients presented late-onset parkinsonism without apparent cognitive decline and demonstrated a good response to levodopa. We obtained three autopsied cases that all presented with isolated nigral degeneration with no alpha-synuclein or other protein inclusions. This is the first report of neuropathological findings in patients with LRRK2 p.R1441H mutations that includes both homozygous and heterozygous mutations. Our findings in this study suggest that isolated nigral degeneration is the primary pathology in patients with LRRK2 p.R1441H mutations, and that protein aggregation of alpha-synuclein or tau might be secondary changes."
"It was previously shown that EphB/ephrinB reverse signaling in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is activated and involved in RGC apoptosis in a rat chronic ocular hypertension (COH) model. In the present work, we first show that ephrinB/EphB forward signaling was activated in COH retinas, and RGC apoptosis in COH retinas was reduced by PP2, an inhibitor of ephrinB/EphB forward signaling. We further demonstrate that treatment of cultured M&#xfc;ller cells with ephrinB1-Fc, an EphB1 activator, or intravitreal injection of ephrinB1-Fc in normal rats induced an increase in phosphorylated EphB levels in these cells, indicating the activation of ephrinB/EphB forward signaling, similar to those in COH retinas. The ephrinB1-Fc treatment did not induce M&#xfc;ller cell gliosis, as evidenced by unchanged GFAP expression, but significantly up-regulated mRNA and protein levels of tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;) in M&#xfc;ller cells, thereby promoting RGC apoptosis. Production of TNF-&#x3b1; induced by the activation of ephrinB/EphB forward signaling was mediated by the NR2B subunit of NMDA receptors, which was followed by a distinct PI3K/Akt/NF-&#x3ba;B signaling pathway, as pharmacological interference of each step of this pathway caused a reduction of TNF-&#x3b1; production, thus attenuating RGC apoptosis. Functional analysis of forward and reverse signaling in such a unique system, in which ephrin and Eph exist respectively in a glial element and a neuronal element, is of theoretical importance. Moreover, our results also raise a possibility that suppression of ephrinB/EphB forward signaling may be a new strategy for ameliorating RGC apoptosis in glaucoma."
"The genetic basis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is poorly understood. Variation in transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) has been associated with enhanced neuroinflammation during aging and with TDP-43-related neurodegenerative disease, and rs3173615, a missense coding SNP in TMEM106B, has been implicated as a functional variant in these processes. Neuroinflammation and TDP-43 pathology are prominent features in CTE. The purpose of this study was to determine whether genetic variation in TMEM106B is associated with CTE risk, pathological features, and ante-mortem dementia. Eighty-six deceased male athletes with a history of participation in American football, informant-reported Caucasian, and a positive postmortem diagnosis of CTE without comorbid neurodegenerative disease were genotyped for rs3173615. The minor allele frequency (MAF&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.42) in participants with CTE did not differ from previously reported neurologically normal controls (MAF&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.43). However, in a case-only analysis among CTE cases, the minor allele was associated with reduced phosphorylated tau (ptau) pathology in the dorsolateral frontal cortex (DLFC) (AT8 density, odds ratio [OR] of increasing one quartile&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22-0.79, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008), reduced neuroinflammation in the DLFC (CD68 density, OR of increasing one quartile&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.53, 95% CI 0.29-0.98, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.043), and increased synaptic protein density (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.306, 95% CI 0.065-0.546, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.014). Among CTE cases, TMEM106B minor allele was also associated with reduced ante-mortem dementia (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.40, 95% CI 0.16-0.99, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.048), but was not associated with TDP-43 pathology. All case-only models were adjusted for age at death and duration of football play. Taken together, variation in TMEM106B may have a protective effect on CTE-related outcomes."
"Mutations in SETD2 are found in many tumors, including central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Previous work has shown these mutations occur specifically in high grade gliomas of the cerebral hemispheres in pediatric and young adult patients. We investigated SETD2 mutations in a cohort of approximately 640 CNS tumors via next generation sequencing; 23 mutations were detected across 19 primary CNS tumors. Mutations were found in a wide variety of tumors and locations at a broad range of allele frequencies. SETD2 mutations were seen in both low and high grade gliomas as well as non-glial tumors, and occurred in patients greater than 55&#xa0;years of age, in addition to pediatric and young adult patients. High grade gliomas at first occurrence demonstrated either frameshift/truncating mutations or point mutations at high allele frequencies, whereas recurrent high grade gliomas frequently harbored subclones with point mutations in SETD2 at lower allele frequencies in the setting of higher mutational burdens. Comparison with the TCGA dataset demonstrated consistent findings. Finally, immunohistochemistry showed decreased staining for H3K36me3 in our cohort of SETD2 mutant tumors compared to wildtype controls. Our data further describe the spectrum of tumors in which SETD2 mutations are found and provide a context for interpretation of these mutations in the clinical setting."
"Parkinson's disease is characterized by progressive death of dopaminergic neurons, leading to motor and cognitive dysfunction. Epidemiological studies consistently show that the use of tobacco reduces the risk of Parkinson's. We report that nicotine reduces the abundance of SIRT6 in neuronal culture and brain tissue. We find that reduction of SIRT6 is partly responsible for neuroprotection afforded by nicotine. Additionally, SIRT6 abundance is greater in Parkinson's patient brains, and decreased in the brains of tobacco users. We also identify SNPs that promote SIRT6 expression and simultaneously associate with an increased risk of Parkinson's. Furthermore, brain-specific SIRT6 knockout mice are protected from MPTP-induced Parkinson's, while SIRT6 overexpressing mice develop more severe pathology. Our data suggest that SIRT6 plays a pathogenic and pro-inflammatory role in Parkinson's and that nicotine can provide neuroprotection by accelerating its degradation. Inhibition of SIRT6 may be a promising strategy to ameliorate Parkinson's and neurodegeneration."
"Pathologic, biochemical and genetic evidence indicates that accumulation and aggregation of amyloid &#x3b2;-proteins (A&#x3b2;) is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several therapeutic interventions attempting to lower A&#x3b2; have failed to ameliorate cognitive decline in patients with clinical AD significantly, but most such approaches target only one or two facets of A&#x3b2; production/clearance/toxicity and do not consider the heterogeneity of human A&#x3b2; species. As synaptic dysfunction may be among the earliest deficits in AD, we used hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) as a sensitive indicator of the early neurotoxic effects of A&#x3b2; species. Here we confirmed prior findings that soluble A&#x3b2; oligomers, much more than fibrillar amyloid plaque cores or A&#x3b2; monomers, disrupt synaptic function. Interestingly, not all (84%) human AD brain extracts are able to inhibit LTP and the degree of LTP impairment by AD brain extracts does not correlate with A&#x3b2; levels detected by standard ELISAs. Bioactive AD brain extracts also induce neurotoxicity in iPSC-derived human neurons. Shorter forms of A&#x3b2; (including A&#x3b2;<sub>1-37</sub>, A&#x3b2;<sub>1-38</sub>, A&#x3b2;<sub>1-39</sub>), pre-A&#x3b2; APP fragments (-&#x2009;30 to -&#x2009;1) and N-terminally extended A&#x3b2;s (-&#x2009;30 to +&#x2009;40) each showed much less synaptotoxicity than longer A&#x3b2;s (A&#x3b2;<sub>1-42</sub> - A&#x3b2;<sub>1-46</sub>). We found that antibodies which target the N-terminus, not the C-terminus, efficiently rescued A&#x3b2; oligomer-impaired LTP and oligomer-facilitated LTD. Our data suggest that preventing soluble A&#x3b2; oligomer formation and targeting their N-terminal residues with antibodies could be an attractive combined therapeutic approach."
"Mutations in ubiquilin2 (UBQLN2) have been linked to abnormal protein aggregation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The mechanisms underlying UBQLN2-related neurodegenerative diseases remain unclear. Using a tetracycline-regulated gene expression system, the ALS-linked UBQLN2<sup>P497H</sup> mutant was selectively expressed in either the spinal motor neurons or astrocytes in rats. We found that selectively expressing mutant UBQLN2<sup>P497H</sup> in the spinal motor neurons caused several core features of ALS, including the progressive degeneration of motor neurons, the denervation atrophy of skeletal muscles, and the abnormal protein accumulation. Furthermore, mutant UBQLN2<sup>P497H</sup> accumulation was associated with an age-dependent decrease in several core autophagy-related proteins. ALS-like phenotypes were not observed when mutant UBQLN2<sup>P497H</sup> was overexpressed in the astrocytes, however, even though the expression of the mutant UBQLN2<sup>P497H</sup> protein was higher in these rats. Our results suggest that selectively expressing mutant UBQLN2<sup>P497H</sup> in motor neurons is sufficient to trigger the development of ALS in rats. Our results further indicate that the compromised autophagy-lysosomal pathway plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of UBQLN2-related neurodegenerative diseases."
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system characterized by massive infiltration of immune cells, demyelination, and axonal loss. Active MS lesions mainly consist of macrophages and microglia containing abundant intracellular myelin remnants. Initial studies showed that these foamy phagocytes primarily promote MS disease progression by internalizing myelin debris, presenting brain-derived autoantigens, and adopting an inflammatory phenotype. However, more recent studies indicate that phagocytes can also adopt a beneficial phenotype upon myelin internalization. In this review, we summarize and discuss the current knowledge on the spatiotemporal physiology of foamy phagocytes in MS lesions, and elaborate on extrinsic and intrinsic factors regulating their behavior. In addition, we discuss and link the physiology of myelin-containing phagocytes to that of foamy macrophages in other disorders such atherosclerosis."
"A hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) within the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) gene is the most prevalent cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/fronto-temporal dementia (ALS/FTD). Current evidence suggests HREs induce neurodegeneration through accumulation of RNA foci and/or dipeptide repeat proteins (DPR). C9orf72 patients are known to have transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy, but whether there is further cross over between C9orf72 pathology and the pathology of other ALS sub-types has yet to be revealed.To address this, we generated and characterised two zebrafish lines expressing C9orf72 HREs. We also characterised pathology in human C9orf72-ALS cases. In addition, we utilised a reporter construct that expresses DsRed under the control of a heat shock promoter, to screen for potential therapeutic compounds.Both zebrafish lines showed accumulation of RNA foci and DPR. Our C9-ALS/FTD zebrafish model is the first to recapitulate the motor deficits, cognitive impairment, muscle atrophy, motor neuron loss and mortality in early adulthood observed in human C9orf72-ALS/FTD. Furthermore, we identified that in zebrafish, human cell lines and human post-mortem tissue, C9orf72 expansions activate the heat shock response (HSR). Additionally, HSR activation correlated with disease progression in our C9-ALS/FTD zebrafish model. Lastly, we identified that the compound ivermectin, as well as riluzole, reduced HSR activation in both C9-ALS/FTD and SOD1 zebrafish models.Thus, our C9-ALS/FTD zebrafish model is a stable transgenic model which recapitulates key features of human C9orf72-ALS/FTD, and represents a powerful drug-discovery tool."
"Since 2013 next-generation sequencing (NGS) targeting genes mutated in diffuse gliomas is part of routine diagnostics in our institute. In the present report, we evaluate the use of this custom tailored NGS platform on 434 samples. The NGS panel assesses mutations in ATRX, CIC, EGFR, FUBP1, NOTCH1, PTEN; H3F3A, IDH1/2, PIK3CA, and BRAF, amplifications in EGFR or MDM2 and copy number alterations (CNA) of chromosome 1p, 7, 10 and 19q. TERT promoter mutations were assessed separately when indicated. Of the 433 samples of individual tumors with NGS data available, 176 cases were diagnosed as grade 2 or 3 glioma (40.6) and in 201 patients a glioblastoma (46.4%). Of the remaining 56 patients, 22 had inconclusive histology. In 378 cases (87.1%) a diagnosis solely based on glioma-targeted NGS could be established and resulted in a different diagnosis in ~&#x2009;1/4 of the cases. In 17 out of 22 cases without a conclusive histological diagnosis NGS resulted in a molecular diagnosis.The current study on a large cohort of patients confirms the diagnostic strength of the platform we developed, with a clear separation of glioma subgroups with different outcomes. It demonstrates the diagnostic value and the efficiency of glioma-targeted NGS for routine glioma diagnostics allowing with a single assay a glioma diagnosis in the large majority of cases. It allows in one run the molecular assessments required for the WHO classification of diffuse gliomas, including the recent recommendations to assess copy number alterations of chromosome 7 and 10, and of the TERT promoter region in IDHwt lower grade glioma."
"Normal Schwann cells (SCs) are quiescent in adult nerves, when ATP is released from the nerve in an activity dependent manner. We find that suppressing nerve activity in adult nerves causes SC to enter the cell cycle. In vitro, ATP activates the SC G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) P2Y2. Downstream of P2Y2, &#x3b2;-arrestin-mediated signaling results in PP2-mediated de-phosphorylation of AKT, and PP2 activity is required for SC growth suppression. NF1 deficient SC show reduced growth suppression by ATP, and are resistant to the effects of &#x3b2;-arrestin-mediated signaling, including PP2-mediated de-phosphorylation of AKT. In patients with the disorder Neurofibromatosis type 1, NF1 mutant SCs proliferate and form SC tumors called neurofibromas. Elevating ATP levels in vivo reduced neurofibroma cell proliferation. Thus, the low proliferation characteristic of differentiated adult peripheral nerve may require ongoing, nerve activity-dependent, ATP. Additionally, we identify a mechanism through which NF1 SCs may evade growth suppression in nerve tumors."
"Tauopathies are a heterogeneous group of pathologies characterized by tau aggregation inside neurons. Most of them are sporadic but certain tauopathies rely on tau gene (MAPT) mutations. They particularly differ from one to another by their different neuropathological signatures e.g. lesion shapes, regions affected and molecular composition of aggregates. Six isoforms of tau exist, but they do not all co-aggregate in each tauopathy but rather have a unique signature for each one. In some tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau protein aggregation follows stereotypical anatomical stages. Recent data suggest that this progression is due to an active process of tau protein propagation from neuron-to-neuron. We wondered how tau isoforms or mutations could influence the process of tau aggregation and tau propagation. In human neuropathological material, we found that MAPT mutations induce a faster misfolding compared to tau found in sporadic AD patients. In the rat brain, we observed cell-to-cell transfer of non-pathological tau species irrespective of the tested isoform or presence of a mutation. By contrast, we found that the species of tau impact the propagation of tau pathology markers such as hyperphosphorylation and misfolding. Indeed, misfolding and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins do not spread at the same rate when tau is mutated, or the isoform composition is modified. These results clearly argue for the existence of specific folding properties of tau depending on isoforms or mutations impacting the behavior of pathological tau species."
"TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) is a ubiquitously expressed DNA-/RNA-binding protein that has been linked to numerous aspects of the mRNA life cycle. Similar to many RNA-binding proteins, TDP-43 expression is tightly regulated through an autoregulatory negative feedback loop. Cell function and survival depend on the strict control of TDP-43 protein levels. TDP-43 has been identified as the major constituent of ubiquitin-positive inclusions in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD). Several observations argue for a pathogenic role of elevated TDP-43 levels in these disorders. Modulation of the cycle of TDP-43 production might therefore provide a new therapeutic strategy. Using a Drosophila model mimicking key features of the TDP-43 autoregulatory feedback loop, we identified CG42724 as a genetic modulator of TDP-43 production in vivo. We found that CG42724 protein influences qualitatively and quantitatively the TDP-43 mRNA transcript pattern. CG42724 overexpression promotes the production of transcripts that can be efficiently released into the cytoplasm for protein translation. Importantly, we showed that TCERG1, the human homolog of the Drosophila CG42724 protein, also caused an increase of TDP-43 protein steady-state levels in mammalian cells. Therefore, our data suggest the possibility that targeting TCERG1 could be therapeutic in TDP-43 proteinopathies."
"Serotoninergic activation which decreases brain A&#x3b2; peptides is considered beneficial in mouse models for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Because growing evidence suggested that the stimulation of proteases digesting A&#x3b2;, especially the endopeptidase neprilysin (NEP) may be effective for AD therapy/prevention, we explored the involvement of serotonin precursors and derivatives in NEP regulation. We found that 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA), the final metabolite of serotonin, considered until now as a dead-end and inactive product of serotonin catabolism, significantly reduces brain A&#x3b2; in the transgenic APPSWE mouse model for AD-related A&#x3b2; pathology and in the phosphoramidon-induced cerebral NEP inhibition mouse model. 5-HIAA treatment improves memory performance in APPSWE mice. Furthermore, 5-HIAA and its precursors increase NEP level in vivo and in neuroblastoma cells. Inhibition of ERK 1/2 cascade by 5-HIAA or SCH772984 enhanced NEP levels, suggesting MAP-kinase pathway involvement in 5-HIAA-induced regulation of NEP expression. Our results provide the first demonstration that 5-HIAA is an active serotonin metabolite that increases brain A&#x3b2; degradation/clearance and improves symptoms in the APPSWE mouse model for AD."
"GJA1 (connexin43) has been predicted as the top key driver of an astrocyte enriched subnetwork associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we comprehensively examined GJA1 expression across 29 transcriptomic and proteomic datasets from post-mortem AD and normal control brains. We demonstrated that GJA1 was strongly associated with AD amyloid and tau pathologies and cognitive functions. RNA sequencing analysis of Gja1-/- astrocytes validated that Gja1 regulated the subnetwork identified in AD, and many genes involved in A&#x3b2; metabolism. Astrocytes lacking Gja1 showed reduced Apoe protein levels as well as impaired A&#x3b2; phagocytosis. Consistent with this, wildtype neurons co-cultured with Gja1-/- astrocytes contained higher levels of A&#x3b2; species than those with wildtype astrocytes. Moreover, Gja1-/- astrocytes was more neuroprotective under A&#x3b2; stress. Our results underscore the importance of GJA1 in AD pathogenesis and its potential for further investigation as a promising pharmacological target in AD."
"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transfer healthy mitochondria to damaged acceptor cells via actin-based intercellular structures. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that MSCs transfer mitochondria to neural stem cells (NSCs) to protect NSCs against the neurotoxic effects of cisplatin treatment. Our results show that MSCs donate mitochondria to NSCs damaged in vitro by cisplatin. Transfer of healthy MSC-derived mitochondria decreases cisplatin-induced NSC death. Moreover, mitochondrial transfer from MSCs to NSCs reverses the cisplatin-induced decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. Blocking the formation of actin-based intercellular structures inhibited the transfer of mitochondria to NSCs and abrogated the positive effects of MSCs on NSC survival. Conversely, overexpression of the mitochondrial motor protein Rho-GTPase 1 (Miro1) in MSCs increased mitochondrial transfer and further improved survival of cisplatin-treated NSCs.In vivo, MSC administration prevented the loss of DCX+ neural progenitor cells in the subventricular zone and hippocampal dentate gyrus which occurs as a result of cisplatin treatment. We propose mitochondrial transfer as one of the mechanisms via which MSCs exert their therapeutic regenerative effects after cisplatin treatment."
"Homozygous mutation of TBC1 domain-containing kinase (TBCK) is the cause of a very recently defined severe childhood disorder, which is characterized by severe hypotonia, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, characteristic facies and premature death. The link between TBCK loss of function and symptoms in patients with TBCK deficiency disorder (TBCK-DD) remains elusive. Here we demonstrate for the first time the histopathological characteristics of TBCK deficiency consisting of 1) a widespread and massive accumulation of lipofuscin storage material in neurons of the central nervous system without notable neuronal degeneration, 2) storage deposits in few astrocytes, 3) carbohydrate-rich deposits in brain, spleen and liver and 4) vacuolated lymphocytes. Biochemical examinations ruled out more than 20 known lysosomal storage diseases. These investigations strikingly uncover TBCK-DD as a novel type of lysosomal storage disease which is characterized by different storage products rather than one specific type of accumulated material. Due to the clear predominance of intraneuronal lipofuscin storage material and the characteristic clinical presentation we propose to classify this disease as a new subtype of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN15). Our results and previous reports suggest an autophagosomal-lysosomal dysfunction caused by enhanced mTORC1-mediated autophagosome formation and reduced Rab-mediated autophagosome-lysosome fusion, thus disclosing potential novel targets for therapeutic approaches in TBCK-DD."
"Several morphological phenotypes have been associated to RYR1-recessive myopathies. We recharacterized the RYR1-recessive morphological spectrum by a large monocentric study performed on 54 muscle biopsies from a large cohort of 48 genetically confirmed patients, using histoenzymology, immunohistochemistry, and ultrastructural studies. We also analysed the level of RyR1 expression in patients' muscle biopsies. We defined ""dusty cores"" the irregular areas of myofibrillar disorganisation characterised by a reddish-purple granular material deposition with uneven oxidative stain and devoid of ATPase activity, which represent the characteristic lesion in muscle biopsy in 54% of patients. We named Dusty Core Disease (DuCD) the corresponding entity of congenital myopathy. Dusty cores had peculiar histological and ultrastructural characteristics compared to the other core diseases. DuCD muscle biopsies also showed nuclear centralization and type1 fibre predominance. Dusty cores were not observed in other core myopathies and centronuclear myopathies. The other morphological groups in our cohort of patients were: Central Core (CCD: 21%), Core-Rod (C&amp;R:15%) and Type1 predominance ""plus"" (T1P+:10%). DuCD group was associated to an earlier disease onset, a more severe clinical phenotype and a lowest level of RyR1 expression in muscle, compared to the other groups. Variants located in the bridge solenoid and the pore domains were more frequent in DuCD patients. In conclusion, DuCD is the most frequent histopathological presentation of RYR1-recessive myopathies. Dusty cores represent the unifying morphological lesion among the DuCD pathology spectrum and are the morphological hallmark for the recessive form of disease."
"Mutations in the FUS gene cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS-FUS). Mutant FUS is known to confer cytoplasmic gain of function but its effects in the nucleus are less understood. FUS is an essential component of paraspeckles, subnuclear bodies assembled on a lncRNA NEAT1. Paraspeckles may play a protective role specifically in degenerating spinal motor neurons. However it is still unknown how endogenous levels of mutant FUS would affect NEAT1/paraspeckles. Using novel cell lines with the FUS gene modified by CRISPR/Cas9 and human patient fibroblasts, we found that endogenous levels of mutant FUS cause accumulation of NEAT1 isoforms and paraspeckles. However, despite only mild cytoplasmic mislocalisation of FUS, paraspeckle integrity is compromised in these cells, as confirmed by reduced interaction of mutant FUS with core paraspeckle proteins NONO and SFPQ and increased NEAT1 extractability. This results in NEAT1 localisation outside paraspeckles, especially prominent under conditions of paraspeckle-inducing stress. Consistently, paraspeckle-dependent microRNA production, a readout for functionality of paraspeckles, is impaired in cells expressing mutant FUS. In line with the cellular data, we observed paraspeckle hyper-assembly in spinal neurons of ALS-FUS patients. Therefore, despite largely preserving its nuclear localisation, mutant FUS leads to loss (dysfunctional paraspeckles) and gain (excess of free NEAT1) of function in the nucleus. Perturbed fine structure and functionality of paraspeckles accompanied by accumulation of non-paraspeckle NEAT1 may contribute to the disease severity in ALS-FUS."
"Early in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its mouse model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), vascular integrity is compromised. This is accompanied by a marked vascular remodeling response, though it is currently unclear whether this is an adaptive vascular repair mechanism or is part of the pathogenic process. In light of the well-described angiogenic role for the &#x3b1;5&#x3b2;1 integrin, the goal of this study was to evaluate how genetic deletion of endothelial &#x3b1;5 integrin (&#x3b1;5-EC-KO mice) impacts vascular remodeling and repair following vascular disruption during EAE pathogenesis, and how this subsequently influences clinical progression and inflammatory demyelination. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that fibronectin and &#x3b1;5 integrin expression were strongly upregulated on spinal cord blood vessels during the pre-symptomatic phase of EAE. Interestingly, &#x3b1;5-EC-KO mice showed much earlier onset and faster progression of EAE, though peak disease severity and chronic disease activity were no different from wild-type mice. At the histological level, earlier disease onset in &#x3b1;5-EC-KO mice correlated with accelerated vascular disruption and increased leukocyte infiltration into the spinal cord. Significantly, spinal cord blood vessels in &#x3b1;5-EC-KO mice showed attenuated endothelial proliferation during the pre-symptomatic phase of EAE which resulted in reduced vascular density at later time-points. Under pro-inflammatory conditions, primary cultures of &#x3b1;5KO brain endothelial cells showed reduced proliferation potential. These findings suggest that &#x3b1;5&#x3b2;1 integrin-mediated angiogenic remodeling represents an important repair mechanism that counteracts vascular disruption during the early stages of EAE development."
"The adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein APMAP is expressed in the brain where it associates with &#x3b3;-secretase, a protease responsible for the generation of the amyloid-&#x3b2; peptides (A&#x3b2;) implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, behavioral investigations revealed spatial learning and memory deficiencies in our newly generated mouse line lacking the protein APMAP. In a mouse model of AD, the constitutive deletion of APMAP worsened the spatial memory phenotype and led to increased A&#x3b2; production and deposition into senile plaques. To investigate at the molecular level the neurobiological functions of APMAP (memory and A&#x3b2; formation) and a possible link with the pathological hallmarks of AD (memory impairment and A&#x3b2; pathology), we next developed a procedure for the high-grade purification of cellular APMAP protein complexes. The biochemical characterization of these complexes revealed a series of new APMAP interactomers. Among these, the heat shock protein HSPA1A and the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CD-M6PR) negatively regulated APP processing and A&#x3b2; production, while clusterin, calnexin, arginase-1, PTGFRN and the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR/IGF2R) positively regulated APP and A&#x3b2; production. Several of the newly identified APMAP interactomers contribute to the autophagy-lysosome system, further supporting an emergent agreement that this pathway can modulate APP metabolism and A&#x3b2; generation. Importantly, we have also demonstrated increased alternative splicing of APMAP and lowered levels of the A&#x3b2; controllers HSPA1A and CD-M6PR in human brains from neuropathologically verified AD cases."
"Pathogenic mutations in the tau gene (microtubule associated protein tau, MAPT) are linked to the onset of tauopathy, but the A152T variant is unique in acting as a risk factor for a range of disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In order to provide insight into the mechanism by which A152T modulates disease risk, we developed a novel mouse model utilizing somatic brain transgenesis with adeno-associated virus (AAV) to drive tau expression in vivo, and validated the model by confirming the distinct biochemical features of A152T tau in postmortem brain tissue from human carriers. Specifically, Tau<sup>A152T</sup>-AAV mice exhibited increased tau phosphorylation that unlike animals expressing the pathogenic P301L mutation remained localized to the soluble fraction. To investigate the possibility that the A152T variant might alter the phosphorylation state of tau on T152 or the neighboring T153 residue, we generated a novel antibody that revealed significant accumulation of soluble tau species that were hyperphosphorylated on T153 (pT153) in Tau<sup>A152T</sup>-AAV mice, which were absent the soluble fraction of Tau<sup>P301L</sup>-AAV mice. Providing new insight into the role of A152T in modifying risk of tauopathy, as well as validating the Tau<sup>A152T</sup>-AAV model, we demonstrate that the presence of soluble pT153-positive tau species in human postmortem brain tissue differentiates A152T carriers from noncarriers, independent of disease classification. These results implicate both phosphorylation of T153 and an altered solubility profile in the mechanism by which A152T modulates disease risk."
"Sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is characterized by cerebrovascular amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) deposition, which leads to lobar hemorrhage and dementia. Biological molecules affecting the development of CAA have not been fully characterized. In this study, we performed proteome analysis of biopsied leptomeningeal and cortical vessels obtained from 6 CAA patients and 5 non-CAA patients who underwent surgery for large lobar hemorrhages. We found that 6 proteins, including A&#x3b2;, apolipoprotein E (apoE), clusterin (CLU), albumin, complement C4 and vitronectin were significantly upregulated in the vessels of CAA patients as compared to non-CAA patients. ApoE and CLU were found in all CAA patients. We next examined the effects of apoE and CLU on the early phase of A&#x3b2; aggregation, using a simple yet powerful in vitro model of CAA, which recapitulates the intramural periarterial drainage pathway model. We found that physiological concentrations of apoE and CLU delayed the initiation time of amyloid growth kinetics in a concentration-dependent manner. These data indicate that apoE and CLU may act as extracellular chaperones to inhibit A&#x3b2; amyloid deposition in CAA."
"PP2A is a major regulator of tau phosphorylation, which is principally regulated by an endogenous nuclear protein inhibitor 2 of PP2A (I<sub>2</sub><sup>PP2A</sup>), also named SET. However, how SET is post-translationally regulated and translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm remain incompletely understood. Here we show SET is SUMOylated at K68 residue that induces its cytoplasmic retention, resulting in Alzheimer disease (AD) like tau pathology and cognitive defects. SET is predominantly SUMOylated at K68 that leads to its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and subsequently induces inhibition of PP2A and hyperphosphorylation of tau in HEK-293 cells. Moreover, overexpression of wild type SET significantly inhibits PP2A activity, leading to tau hyperphosphorylation, less synapse loss and cognitive deficits. Conversely, blocking SET SUMOylation via mutating Lys 68 to Arg rescues tau pathology and cognitive impairments in C57/BL6 mice infected with adeno-associated virus encoding SET. Further, &#x3b2;-amyloid exposure of rat primary hippocampal neurons induces a dose-dependent SUMOylation of SET. Our findings suggest that SET SUMOylation stimulates its cytoplasmic retention and inhibits PP2A activity, consequently leading to tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive impairments, which provides a new insight into the AD-like tau pathology."
"Tau neuronal and glial pathologies drive the clinical presentation of Alzheimer's disease and related human tauopathies. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that pathological tau species can travel from cell to cell and spread the pathology through the brain. Throughout the last decade, physiological and pathological tau have become attractive targets for AD therapies. Several therapeutic approaches have been proposed, including the inhibition of protein kinases or protein-3-O-(N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl)-L-serine/threonine Nacetylglucosaminyl hydrolase, the inhibition of tau aggregation, active and passive immunotherapies, and tau silencing by antisense oligonucleotides. New tau therapeutics, across the board, have demonstrated the ability to prevent or reduce tau lesions and improve either cognitive or motor impairment in a variety of animal models developing neurofibrillary pathology. The most advanced strategy for the treatment of human tauopathies remains immunotherapy, which has already reached the clinical stage of drug development. Tau vaccines or humanised antibodies target a variety of tau species either in the intracellular or extracellular spaces. Some of them recognise the amino-terminus or carboxy-terminus, while others display binding abilities to the proline-rich area or microtubule binding domains. The main therapeutic foci in existing clinical trials are on Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and non-fluent primary progressive aphasia. Tau therapy offers a new hope for the treatment of many fatal brain disorders. First efficacy data from clinical trials will be available by the end of this decade."
"Monocytes/macrophages have begun to emerge as key cellular modulators of brain homeostasis and central nervous system (CNS) disease. In the healthy brain, resident microglia are the predominant macrophage cell population; however, under conditions of blood-brain barrier leakage, peripheral monocytes/macrophages can infiltrate the brain and participate in CNS disease pathogenesis. Distinguishing these two populations is often challenging, owing to a paucity of universally accepted and reliable markers. To identify discriminatory marker sets for microglia and peripheral monocytes/macrophages, we employed a large meta-analytic approach using five published murine transcriptional datasets. Following hierarchical clustering, we filtered the top differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through a brain cell type-specific sequencing database, which led to the identification of eight microglia and eight peripheral monocyte/macrophage markers. We then validated their differential expression, leveraging a published single cell RNA sequencing dataset and quantitative RT-PCR using freshly isolated microglia and peripheral monocytes/macrophages from two different mouse strains. We further verified the translation of these DEGs at the protein level. As top microglia DEGs, we identified P2ry12, Tmem119, Slc2a5 and Fcrls, whereas Emilin2, Gda, Hp and Sell emerged as the best DEGs for identifying peripheral monocytes/macrophages. Lastly, we evaluated their utility in discriminating monocyte/macrophage populations in the setting of brain pathology (glioma), and found that these DEG sets distinguished glioma-associated microglia from macrophages in both RCAS and GL261 mouse models of glioblastoma. Taken together, this unbiased bioinformatic approach facilitated the discovery of a robust set of microglia and peripheral monocyte/macrophage expression markers to discriminate these monocyte populations in both health and disease."
"Human inflammatory or neurodegenerative diseases, such as progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), occur on a background of age-related microglia activation and iron accumulation as well as pre-existing neurodegeneration. Most experimental models for CNS diseases, however, are induced in rodents, which are naturally characterized by a homeostatic microglia phenotype, low cellular iron load and absence of neurodegeneration. Here, we show that na&#xef;ve LEWzizi rats - Lewis rats with a zitter rat background - show a spontaneous phenotype partly mimicking the changes seen in human aging and particularly in the normal-appearing white and grey matter of patients with progressive MS. Using this model system, we further aimed to investigate (i) whether the acute monophasic MS model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) transforms into chronic progressive disease and (ii) whether EAE-induced neuroinflammation and tissue damage aggravate on the LEWzizi background. We found that the pre-existing LEWzizi-specific pathology precipitated EAE-related neuroinflammation into forebrain areas, which are devoid of EAE lesions in normal Lewis rats. However, EAE-related tissue damage was neither modified by the LEWzizi-specific pathology nor did EAE-induced neuroinflammation modify the LEWzizi-related pathological process. Our data indicate that the interaction between pre-activated microglia and CD4<sup>+</sup> autoreactive T cells during the induction and propagation of tissue damage in the CNS is limited."
"The introduction of the classification of brain tumours based on their DNA methylation profile has significantly changed the diagnostic approach for cases with ambiguous histology, non-informative or contradictory molecular profiles or for entities where methylation profiling provides useful information for patient risk stratification, for example in medulloblastoma and ependymoma. We present our experience that combines a conventional molecular diagnostic approach with the complementary use of a DNA methylation-based classification tool, for adult brain tumours originating from local as well as national referrals. We report the frequency of IDH mutations in a large cohort of nearly 1550 patients, EGFR amplifications in almost 1900 IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, and histone mutations in 70 adult gliomas. We demonstrate how additional methylation-based classification has changed and improved our diagnostic approach. Of the 325 cases referred for methylome testing, 179 (56%) had a calibrated score of 0.84 and higher and were included in the evaluation. In these 179 samples, the diagnosis was changed in 45 (25%), refined in 86 (48%) and confirmed in 44 cases (25%). In addition, the methylation arrays contain copy number information that usefully complements the methylation profile. For example, EGFR amplification which is 95% concordant with our Real-Time PCR-based copy number assays. We propose here a diagnostic algorithm that integrates histology, conventional molecular tests and methylation arrays."
"The synaptic changes underlying the onset of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are poorly understood. In contrast to the well documented inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA3-CA1 synapses by acute A&#x3b2; application in adult neurons from rodents, young amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mouse models often, surprisingly, show normal LTP. This suggests that there may be important differences between mature-onset and developmental-onset APP expression/ A&#x3b2; accumulation and the ensuing synaptic and behavioural phenotype. Here, in agreement with previous studies, we observed that developmental expression of APP<sub>Sw,Ind</sub> (3-4&#x2009;month old mice from line 102, PLoS Med 2:e355, 2005), resulted in reduced basal synaptic transmission in CA3-CA1 synapses, normal LTP, impaired spatial working memory, but normal spatial reference memory. To analyse early A&#x3b2;-mediated synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment in a more mature brain, we used controllable mature-onset APP<sub>Sw,Ind</sub> expression in line 102 mice. Within 3&#x2009;weeks of mature-onset APP<sub>Sw,Ind</sub> expression and A&#x3b2; accumulation, we detected the first synaptic dysfunction: an impairment of LTP in hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses. Cognitively, at this time point, we observed a deficit in short-term memory. A reduction in basal synaptic strength and deficit in long-term associative spatial memory were only evident following 12&#x2009;weeks of APP<sub>Sw,Ind</sub> expression. Importantly, the plasticity impairment observed after 3&#x2009;weeks of mature-onset APP expression is reversible. Together, these findings demonstrate important differences between developmental and mature-onset APP expression. Further research targeted at this early stage of synaptic dysfunction could help identify mechanisms to treat cognitive impairment in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD."
"In the setting of stroke, ischemia-related blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction aggravates the cerebral edema, which critically impacts on the clinical outcome. Further, an impaired vascular integrity is associated with the risk of intracranial bleeding, especially after therapeutic recanalization. Therefore, the present study was aimed to investigate early vascular alterations from 30&#x2009;min to 4&#x2009;h after experimental middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice. Here, an extravasation of the permeability marker FITC-albumin was detectable in animals 2 and 4&#x2009;h after MCAO. Thereby, BBB breakdown correlated with alterations of the endothelial surface, indicated by a discontinuous isolectin-B4 staining, while tight junction strands remained detectable using electron and immunofluorescence microscopy. Noteworthy, already 30&#x2009;min after MCAO, up to 60% of the ischemia-affected vessels showed an endothelial edema, paralleled by edematous astrocytic endfeet, clearly preceding FITC-albumin extravasation. With increasing ischemic periods, scores of vascular damage significantly increased with up to 60% of the striatal vessels showing loss of endothelial integrity. Remarkably, comparison of permanent and transient ischemia did not provide significant differences 4&#x2009;h after ischemia induction. As these degenerations also involved penumbral areas of potentially salvageable tissue, adjuvant approaches of endothelial protection may help to reduce the vasogenic edema after ischemic stroke."
"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is pathologically subdivided based on the presence of particular pathological proteins that are identified in inclusion bodies observed post-mortem. The FTLD-FUS subgroup is defined by the presence of the fused in sarcoma protein (FUS) in pathological inclusions. FUS is a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) protein and a member of the FET (FUS, EWS, TAF15) protein family. It shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and has been implicated in many cellular functions including translation, splicing, and RNA transport. EWS, TAF15 and the nuclear import receptor transportin have been shown to co-accumulate with FUS in neuronal inclusions specifically in FTLD-FUS, with transportin-positive inclusions most frequently observed. Here, we report the identification of hnRNP R and hnRNP Q in neuronal cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of FTLD-FUS patients, as frequently as transportin. hnRNP R and hnRNP Q were not found in the characteristic pathological inclusions observed in FTLD-TDP (subtypes A-C). Additionally, we studied the expression of hnRNP R in the frontal and temporal cortices from patients with FTLD and found significantly increased expression of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein R in several FTLD disease groups. Our identification of the frequent presence of hnRNP R and hnRNP Q in FTLD-FUS inclusions suggests a potential role for these hnRNPs in FTLD-FUS pathogenesis and supports the role of dysfunctional RNA metabolism in FTLD."
"TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein, which participates in a number of cellular processes and has been identified as the major pathological factor in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Here we constructed a conditional TDP-43 mouse with depletion of TDP-43 in the mouse forebrain and find that the mice exhibit a whole spectrum of age-dependent frontotemporal dementia-like behaviour abnormalities including perturbation of social behaviour, development of dementia-like behaviour, changes of activities of daily living, and memory loss at a later stage of life. These variations are accompanied with inflammation, neurodegeneration, and abnormal synaptic plasticity of the mouse CA1 neurons. Importantly, analysis of the cortical RNA transcripts of the conditional knockout mice at the pre-/post-symptomatic stages and the corresponding wild type mice reveals age-dependent alterations in the expression levels and RNA processing patterns of a set of genes closely associated with inflammation, social behaviour, synaptic plasticity, and neuron survival. This study not only supports the scenario that loss-of-function of TDP-43 in mice may recapitulate key behaviour features of the FTLD diseases, but also provides a list of TDP-43 target genes/transcript isoforms useful for future therapeutic research."
"At the blood-brain barrier (BBB), laminin-&#x3b1;5 is predominantly synthesized by endothelial cells and mural cells. Endothelial laminin-&#x3b1;5 is dispensable for BBB maintenance under homeostatic conditions but inhibits inflammatory cell extravasation in pathological conditions. Whether mural cell-derived laminin-&#x3b1;5 is involved in vascular integrity regulation, however, remains unknown. To answer this question, we generated transgenic mice with laminin-&#x3b1;5 deficiency in mural cells (&#x3b1;5-PKO). Under homeostatic conditions, no defects in BBB integrity and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were observed in &#x3b1;5-PKO mice, suggesting that mural cell-derived laminin-&#x3b1;5 is dispensable for BBB maintenance and CBF regulation under homeostatic conditions. After ischemia-reperfusion (MCAO) injury, however, &#x3b1;5-PKO mice displayed less severe neuronal injury, including reduced infarct volume, decreased neuronal death, and improved neurological function. In addition, &#x3b1;5-PKO mice also showed attenuated vascular damage (milder BBB disruption, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, decreased brain edema, and diminished hemorrhagic transformation). Mechanistic studies revealed less severe tight junction protein (TJP) loss and pericyte coverage reduction in &#x3b1;5-PKO mice after ischemia-reperfusion injury, indicating that the attenuated ischemic injury in &#x3b1;5-PKO mice is possibly due to less severe vascular damage. These findings suggest that mural cell-derived laminin-&#x3b1;5 plays a detrimental role in ischemic stroke and that inhibiting its signaling may have a neuroprotective effect."
"Recent evidences suggest the involvement of DYRK1A (dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1 A) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we showed that DYRK1A undergoes a proteolytic processing in AD patients hippocampus without consequences on its kinase activity. Resulting truncated forms accumulate in astrocytes and exhibit increased affinity towards STAT3&#x251;, a regulator of inflammatory process. These findings were confirmed in APP/PS1 mice, an amyloid model of AD, suggesting that this DYRK1A cleavage is a consequence of the amyloid pathology. We identified in vitro the Leucettine L41 as a compound able to prevent DYRK1A proteolysis in both human and mouse protein extracts. We then showed that intraperitoneal injections of L41 in aged APP/PS1 mice inhibit STAT3&#x251; phosphorylation and reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines levels (IL1- &#x3b2;, TNF-&#x251; and IL-12) associated to an increased microglial recruitment around amyloid plaques and decreased amyloid-&#x3b2; plaque burden. Importantly, L41 treatment improved synaptic plasticity and rescued memory functions in APP/PS1 mice. Collectively, our results suggest that DYRK1A may contribute to AD pathology through its proteolytic process, reducing its kinase specificity. Further evaluation of inhibitors of DYRK1A truncation promises a new therapeutic approach for AD."
"Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are one of the most common causes of familial Parkinson's disease (PD). The most common mutations in the LRRK2 gene induce elevated kinase activity of the LRRK2 protein. Recent studies have also suggested that LRRK2 kinase activity may be elevated in idiopathic PD patients, even in the absence of LRRK2 mutations. LRRK2 is therefore a prime candidate for small molecule kinase inhibitor development. However, it is currently unknown how LRRK2 influences the underlying pathogenesis of PD and how LRRK2 might influence extant pathogenesis. To understand whether LRRK2 inhibition would show some benefit in the absence of LRRK2 mutations, we treated a preclinical mouse model of PD with the potent LRRK2 inhibitor MLi-2. The inhibitor was well-tolerated by mice and dramatically reduced LRRK2 kinase activity. However, LRRK2 inhibition did not reverse motor phenotypes, pathological &#x3b1;-synuclein accumulation or neuron loss. The current study suggests that LRRK2 is not necessary for &#x3b1;-synuclein pathogenesis in this mouse model of PD and that further studies are needed to assess the likely clinical benefit of LRRK2 inhibition in idiopathic PD."
"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is typified by the cerebrovascular deposition of amyloid. Currently, there is no clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying the contribution of CAA to neurodegeneration. Despite the fact that CAA is highly associated with accumulation of A&#x3b2;, other types of amyloids have been shown to associate with the vasculature. Interestingly, in many cases, vascular amyloidosis is accompanied by significant tau pathology. However, the contribution of tau to neurodegeneration associated to CAA remains to be determined. We used a mouse model of Familial Danish Dementia (FDD), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of Danish amyloid (ADan) in the vasculature, to characterize the contribution of tau to neurodegeneration associated to CAA. We performed histological and biochemical assays to establish tau modifications associated with CAA in conjunction with cell-based and electrophysiological assays to determine the role of tau in the synaptic dysfunction associated with ADan. We demonstrated that ADan aggregates induced hyperphosphorylation and misfolding of tau. Moreover, in a mouse model for CAA, we observed tau oligomers closely associated to astrocytes in the vicinity of vascular amyloid deposits. We finally determined that the absence of tau prevents synaptic dysfunction induced by ADan oligomers. In addition to demonstrating the effect of ADan amyloid on tau misfolding, our results provide compelling evidence of the role of tau in neurodegeneration associated with ADan-CAA and suggest that decreasing tau levels could be a feasible approach for the treatment of CAA."
"Insights into tau molecular structures have advanced significantly in recent years. This field has been the subject of recent breakthroughs, including the first cryo-electron microscopy structures of tau filaments from Alzheimer's and Pick's disease inclusions, as well as the structure of the repeat regions of tau bound to microtubules. Tau structure covers various species as the tau protein itself takes many forms. We will here address a range of studies that help to define the many facets of tau protein structures and how they translate into pathogenic forms. New results shed light on previous data that need now to be revisited in order to up-date our knowledge of tau molecular structure. Finally, we explore how these data can contribute the important medical aspects of this research - diagnosis and therapeutics."
"TRIM32 is a E3 ubiquitin -ligase containing RING, B-box, coiled-coil and six C-terminal NHL domains. Mutations involving NHL and coiled-coil domains result in a pure myopathy (LGMD2H/STM) while the only described mutation in the B-box domain is associated with a multisystemic disorder without myopathy (Bardet-Biedl syndrome type11), suggesting that these domains are involved in distinct processes. Knock-out (T32KO) and knock-in mice carrying the c.1465G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A (p.D489N) involving the NHL domain (T32KI) show alterations in muscle regrowth after atrophy and satellite cells senescence. Here, we present phenotypical description and functional characterization of mutations in the RING, coiled-coil and NHL domains of TRIM32 causing a muscle dystrophy. Reduced levels of TRIM32 protein was observed in all patient muscle studied, regardless of the type of mutation (missense, single amino acid deletion, and frameshift) or the mutated domain. The affected patients presented with variable phenotypes but predominantly proximal weakness. Two patients had symptoms of both muscular dystrophy and Bardet-Biedl syndrome. The muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pattern is highly variable among patients and families. Primary myoblast culture from these patients demonstrated common findings consistent with reduced proliferation and differentiation, diminished satellite cell pool, accelerated senescence of muscle, and signs of autophagy activation."
"Signaling between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria regulates a number of key neuronal functions. This signaling involves close physical contacts between the two organelles that are mediated by ""tethering proteins"" that function to recruit regions of ER to the mitochondrial surface. The ER protein, vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B (VAPB) and the mitochondrial membrane protein, protein tyrosine phosphatase interacting protein-51 (PTPIP51), interact to form one such tether. Recently, damage to ER-mitochondria signaling involving disruption of the VAPB-PTPIP51 tethers has been linked to the pathogenic process in Parkinson's disease, fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) and related amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Loss of neuronal synaptic function is a key feature of Parkinson's disease and FTD/ALS but the roles that ER-mitochondria signaling and the VAPB-PTPIP51 tethers play in synaptic function are not known. Here, we demonstrate that the VAPB-PTPIP51 tethers regulate synaptic activity. VAPB and PTPIP51 localise and form contacts at synapses, and stimulating neuronal activity increases ER-mitochondria contacts and the VAPB-PTPIP51 interaction. Moreover, siRNA loss of VAPB or PTPIP51 perturbs synaptic function and dendritic spine morphology. Our results reveal a new role for the VAPB-PTPIP51 tethers in neurons and suggest that damage to ER-mitochondria signaling contributes to synaptic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease and FTD/ALS."
"Astroblastoma (AB) is a rare CNS tumor demonstrating abundant astroblastomatous pseudorosettes. Its molecular features have not been comprehensively studied and its status as a tumor entity is controversial. We analyzed a cohort of 27 histologically-defined ABs using DNA methylation profiling, copy number analysis, FISH and site-directed sequencing. Most cases demonstrated mutually exclusive MN1 rearrangements (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;10) or BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutations (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;7). Two additional cases harbored RELA rearrangements. Other cases lacked these specific genetic alterations (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;8). By DNA methylation profiling, tumors with MN1 or RELA rearrangement clustered with high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with MN1 alteration (HGNET-MN1) and RELA-fusion ependymoma, respectively. In contrast, BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mutant tumors grouped with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA). Six additional tumors clustered with either supratentorial pilocytic astrocytoma and ganglioglioma (LGG-PA/GG-ST), normal or reactive cerebrum, or with no defined DNA methylation class. While certain histologic features favored one genetic group over another, no group could be reliably distinguished by histopathology alone. Survival analysis between genetic AB subtypes was limited by sample size, but showed that MN1-rearranged AB tumors were characterized by better overall survival compared to other genetic subtypes, in fact, significantly better than BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mutant tumors (P&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.013). Our data confirm that histologically-defined ABs are molecularly heterogeneous and do not represent a single entity. They rather encompass several low- to higher-grade glial tumors including neuroepithelial tumors with MN1 rearrangement, PXA-like tumors, RELA ependymomas, and possibly yet uncharacterized lesions. Genetic subtyping of tumors exhibiting AB histology, particularly determination of MN1 and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> status, is necessary for important prognostic and possible treatment implications."
"Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumor of adults. The majority are benign (WHO grade I), with a mostly indolent course; 20% of them (WHO grade II and III) are, however, considered aggressive and require a more complex management. WHO grade II and III tumors are heterogeneous and, in some cases, can develop from a prior lower grade meningioma, although most arise de novo. Mechanisms leading to progression or implicated in de novo grade II and III tumorigenesis are poorly understood. RNA-seq was used to profile the transcriptome of grade I, II, and III meningiomas and to identify genes that may be involved in progression. Bioinformatic analyses showed that grade I meningiomas that progress to a higher grade are molecularly different from those that do not. As such, we identify GREM2, a regulator of the BMP pathway, and the snoRNAs SNORA46 and SNORA48, as being significantly reduced in meningioma progression. Additionally, our study has identified several novel fusion transcripts that are differentially present in meningiomas, with grade I tumors that did not progress presenting more fusion transcripts than all other tumors. Interestingly, our study also points to a difference in the tumor immune microenvironment that correlates with histopathological grade."
"Encephalitis with anti-NMDAR antibodies (NMDAR-E) is a severe autoimmune neurological disorder, defined by a clinical presentation of encephalitis and the presence of IgG targeting the GluN1 subunit of NMDA receptors in the CSF. An underlying ovarian teratoma is commonly associated with this autoimmune disease suggesting a role of the tumor in immunopathogenesis. In this study, we characterized the salient histopathological features of 27 ovarian teratomas associated with NMDAR-E (3 immature and 24 mature teratomas) and 40 controls without associated encephalitis. All but one NMDAR-E-associated teratomas contained a nervous tissue component, while less than 40% of control teratomas did (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). GluN1 expression by teratomatous nervous tissue seemed to be more often glial in NMDAR-E teratomas than in control teratomas (73% vs. 29%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Strikingly, 3 out of 24 NMDAR-E-associated mature teratomas contained neuroglial tissue exhibiting histopathological features of central nervous system neuroglial tumor, while such glioma-like features are exceptionally described in the literature on ovarian teratomas. Moreover, NMDAR-E associated teratomas differed from sporadic ovarian teratomas by consistent and prominent infiltration of the nervous tissue component by immune cells, comprised of T- and B-cells and mature dendritic cells organized in tertiary lymphoid structures, with IgG and IgA deposits and plasma cells in close contact to the neuroglial tissue.These data demonstrate an association between massive infiltration of NMDAR-E-associated teratomas by immune cells and particular glial features of its neuroglial component, suggesting that this glial tissue might be involved in triggering or sustaining the anti-tumor response associated with the auto-immune neurological disease."
"Human homologue of yeast UV excision repair protein Rad23b (HR23B) inclusions are found in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and 7 (SCA3/7), fragile X associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we describe HR23B pathology in C9ORF72 linked FTD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases. HR23B presented in neuropils, intranuclear inclusions and cytoplasmic and perinuclear inclusions and was predominantly found in cortices (frontal, temporal and motor), spinal cord and hippocampal dentate gyrus. HR23B co-localized with poly-GA-, pTDP-43- and p62-positive inclusions in frontal cortex and in hippocampal dentate gyrus, the latter showing higher co-localization percentages. HR23B binding partners XPC, 20S and ataxin-3, which are involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), did not show an aberrant distribution. However, C9ORF72 fibroblasts were more sensitive for UV-C damage than healthy control fibroblasts, even though all factors involved in NER localized normally to DNA damage and the efficiency of DNA repair was not reduced. HR23Bs other binding partner NGly1/PNGase, involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded proteins, was not expressed in the majority of neurons in C9FTD/ALS brain sections compared to non-demented controls. Our results suggest a difference in HR23B aggregation and co-localization pattern with DPRs, pTDP-43 and p62 between different brain areas from C9FTD/ALS cases. We hypothesize that HR23B may play a role in C9ORF72 pathogenesis, possibly by aberrant ERAD functioning."
"A pathological pathway leading from soluble monomeric to insoluble filamentous Tau is characteristic of many human neurodegenerative diseases, which also exhibit dysfunction and death of brain cells. However, it is unknown how the assembly of Tau into filaments relates to cell loss. To study this, we first used a mouse line transgenic for full-length human mutant P301S Tau to investigate the temporal relationship between Tau assembly into filaments, assessed using anti-Tau antibody AT100, and motor neuron numbers, in the lumbar spinal cord. AT100 immunoreactivity preceded nerve cell loss. Murine Tau did not contribute significantly to either Tau aggregation or neurodegeneration. To further study the relevance of filament formation for neurodegeneration, we deleted hexapeptides <sup>275</sup>VQIINK<sup>280</sup> and <sup>306</sup>VQIVYK<sup>311</sup>, either singly or in combination, from human 0N4R Tau with the P301S mutation. These hexapeptides are essential for the assembly of Tau into filaments. Homozygous mice transgenic for P301S Tau with the hexapeptide deletions, which expressed Tau at a similar level to the heterozygous line transgenic for P301S Tau, had a normal lifespan, unlike mice from the P301S Tau line. The latter had significant levels of sarkosyl-insoluble Tau in brain and spinal cord, and exhibited neurodegeneration. Mice transgenic for P301S Tau with the hexapeptide deletions failed to show significant levels of sarkosyl-insoluble Tau or neurodegeneration. Recombinant P301S Tau with the hexapeptide deletions failed to form &#x3b2;-sheet structure and filaments following incubation with heparin. Taken together, we conclude that &#x3b2;-sheet assembly of human P301S Tau is necessary for neurodegeneration in transgenic mice."
"Misfolded alpha-synuclein (&#x3b1;Syn) is a major constituent of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which are pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD). The contribution of &#x3b1;Syn to PD is well established, but the detailed mechanism remains obscure. Using a model in which &#x3b1;Syn aggregation in primary neurons was seeded by exogenously added, preformed &#x3b1;Syn amyloid fibrils (PFF), we found that a majority of pathogenic &#x3b1;Syn (indicated by serine 129 phosphorylated &#x3b1;Syn, ps-&#x3b1;Syn) was membrane-bound and associated with mitochondria. In contrast, only a minuscule amount of physiological &#x3b1;Syn was mitochondrial bound. In vitro, &#x3b1;Syn PFF displayed a stronger binding to purified mitochondria than did &#x3b1;Syn monomer, revealing a preferential mitochondria binding by aggregated &#x3b1;Syn. This selective mitochondrial ps-&#x3b1;Syn accumulation was confirmed in other neuronal and animal &#x3b1;Syn aggregation models that do not require exogenously added PFF and, more importantly, in postmortem brain tissues of patients suffering from PD and other neurodegenerative diseases with &#x3b1;Syn aggregation (&#x3b1;-synucleinopathies). We also showed that the mitochondrial ps-&#x3b1;Syn accumulation was accompanied by defects in cellular respiration in primary neurons, suggesting a link to mitochondrial dysfunction. Together, our results show that, contrary to physiological &#x3b1;Syn, pathogenic &#x3b1;Syn aggregates preferentially bind to mitochondria, indicating mitochondrial dysfunction as the common downstream mechanism for &#x3b1;-synucleinopathies. Our findings suggest a plausible model explaining the formation and the peculiar morphology of Lewy body and reveal that disrupting the interaction between ps-&#x3b1;Syn and the mitochondria is a therapeutic target for &#x3b1;-synucleinopathies."
"A previous study reported that a massive cerebral infarct in the territory of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) may be associated with development of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the ipsilateral basal nucleus of Meynert (BNM). We analyzed 19 cases of an MCA territory infarct and 12 with a putaminal hemorrhage (mean age 82.5&#x2009;years; female/male ratio 8/23; mean time from stroke onset to autopsy 4182&#x2009;days). In both groups, 74-100% had a significantly higher rate of phosphorylated tau immunoreactive or Gallyas Braak silver stain-positive neurons on the BNM-affected side than on the BNM-unaffected side. These NFTs were immunoreactive for anti-RD3 and anti-RD4 antibodies, and a triple-band pattern was observed by immunoblot analysis with anti-tau antibody. Most NFTs might be formed within the 5-10&#x2009;years after stroke onset. There were significantly more TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) immunoreactive structures on the BNM-affected side than on the BNM-unaffected side. We showed that many NFTs with TDP43-immunoreactive structures were observed in the ipsilateral BNM associated with a massive cerebral infarct in the MCA territory or a putaminal hemorrhage."
"Glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) containing aggregated and hyperphosphorylated &#x3b1;-synuclein are the signature neuropathological hallmark of multiple system atrophy (MSA). Native &#x3b1;-synuclein can adopt a prion conformation that self-propagates and spreads throughout the brain ultimately resulting in neurodegeneration. A growing body of evidence argues that, in addition to oligodendrocytes, astrocytes contain &#x3b1;-synuclein inclusions in MSA and other &#x3b1;-synucleinopathies at advanced stages of disease. To study the role of astrocytes in MSA, we added MSA brain homogenate to primary cultures of astrocytes from transgenic (Tg) mouse lines expressing human &#x3b1;-synuclein. Astrocytes from four Tg lines, expressing either wild-type or mutant (A53T or A30P) human &#x3b1;-synuclein, propagated and accumulated &#x3b1;-synuclein prions. Furthermore, we found that MSA-infected astrocytes formed two morphologically distinct &#x3b1;-synuclein inclusions: filamentous and granular. Both types of cytoplasmic inclusions shared several features characteristic of &#x3b1;-synuclein inclusions in synucleinopathies: hyperphosphorylation preceded by aggregation, ubiquitination, thioflavin S-positivity, and co-localization with p62. Our findings demonstrate that human &#x3b1;-synuclein forms distinct inclusion morphologies and propagates within cultured Tg astrocytes exposed to MSA prions, indicating that &#x3b1;-synuclein expression determines the tropism of inclusion formation in certain cells. Thus, our work may prove useful in elucidating the role of astrocytes in the pathogenic mechanisms that feature in neurodegeneration caused by MSA prions."
"Inter-individual differences in cortisol production by the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are thought to contribute to clinical and pathological heterogeneity of multiple sclerosis (MS). At the same time, accumulating evidence indicates that MS pathogenesis may originate in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). Therefore, we performed a genome-wide transcriptional analysis, by Agilent microarray, of post-mortem NAWM of 9 control subjects and 18 MS patients to investigate to what extent gene expression reflects disease heterogeneity and HPA-axis activity. Activity of the HPA axis was determined by cortisol levels in cerebrospinal fluid and by numbers of corticotropin-releasing neurons in the hypothalamus, while duration of MS and time to EDSS6 served as indicator of disease severity. Applying weighted gene co-expression network analysis led to the identification of a range of gene modules with highly similar co-expression patterns that strongly correlated with various indicators of HPA-axis activity and/or severity of MS. Interestingly, molecular profiles associated with relatively mild MS and high HPA-axis activity were characterized by increased expression of genes that actively regulate inflammation and by molecules involved in myelination, anti-oxidative mechanism, and neuroprotection. Additionally, group-wise comparisons of gene expression in white matter from control subjects and NAWM from (subpopulations of) MS patients uncovered disease-associated gene expression as well as strongly up- or downregulated genes in patients with relatively benign MS and/or high HPA-axis activity, with many differentially expressed genes being previously undescribed in the context of MS. Overall, the data suggest that HPA-axis activity strongly impacts on molecular mechanisms in NAWM of MS patients, but partly also independently of disease severity."
"Brain water homeostasis is essential for the appropriate control of neuronal activity. Furthermore, the encasement of the central nervous system (CNS) by a hard structure, greatly limits its tolerance for the volume changes occurring with acute brain edema, which quickly leads to severe damage or death.The recent discovery of the extended isoform of AQP4 (AQP4ex), generated by translational readthrough, revealed a potential new mechanism of water transport regulation and polarization at the blood-brain-barrier level.In the present study we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate an AQP4ex<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model and evaluate the effect on the overall AQP4 expression, polarization, supramolecular organization in orthogonal arrays of particles (OAPs) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO-IgG) autoantibodies binding.AQP4ex removal did not cause a decrease in total AQP4 protein expression but completely suppressed the specific location of AQP4 at the astrocyte endfeet. Without AQP4ex, AQP4 was mislocalized and &#x3b1;-syntrophin expression, the selective partner for AQP4 localization, was partially altered. The supramolecular organization of AQP4 in OAPs was subtly altered. Indeed, the absence of AQP4ex reduced the size of AQP4-OAPs but the number of AQP4-OAP pools remained largely the same. More importantly, AQP4ex resulted critical for the binding of pathogenic human NMO-IgG autoantibodies to the brain. Indeed, the absence of AQP4ex completely abolished the binding of NMO-IgG at the perivascular astrocyte endfeet.This study provides the first direct evidence in vivo on the specific role of AQP4ex in AQP4 perivascular OAPs assembly and confinement and reveals AQP4ex as new and important player in neuromyelitis optica."
"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but the underlying disease mechanisms remain unclear. In an unbiased screen in Drosophila for RBPs that genetically interact with TDP-43, we found that downregulation of the mRNA export factor Ref1 (fly orthologue to human ALYREF) mitigated TDP-43 induced toxicity. Further, Ref1 depletion also reduced toxicity caused by expression of the C9orf72 GGGGCC repeat expansion. Ref1 knockdown lowered the mRNA levels for these related disease genes and reduced the encoded proteins with no effect on a wild-type Tau disease transgene or a control transgene. Interestingly, expression of TDP-43 or the GGGGCC repeat expansion increased endogenous Ref1 mRNA levels in the fly brain. Further, the human orthologue ALYREF was upregulated by immunohistochemistry in ALS motor neurons, with the strongest upregulation occurring in ALS cases harboring the GGGGCC expansion in C9orf72. These data support ALYREF as a contributor to ALS/FTD and highlight its downregulation as a potential therapeutic target that may affect co-existing disease etiologies."
"The discovery of an expanded (GGGGCC)n repeat (termed G4C2) within the first intron of C9orf72 in familial ALS/FTD has led to a number of studies showing that the aberrant expression of G4C2 RNA can produce toxic dipeptides through repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN-) translation. To reveal canonical translation factors that impact this process, an unbiased loss-of-function screen was performed in a G4C2 fly model that maintained the upstream intronic sequence of the human gene and contained a GFP tag in the GR reading frame. 11 of 48 translation factors were identified that impact production of the GR-GFP protein. Further investigations into two of these, eIF4B and eIF4H, revealed that downregulation of these factors reduced toxicity caused by the expression of expanded G4C2 and reduced production of toxic GR dipeptides from G4C2 transcripts. In patient-derived cells and in post-mortem tissue from ALS/FTD patients, eIF4H was found to be downregulated in cases harboring the G4C2 mutation compared to patients lacking the mutation and healthy individuals. Overall, these data define eIF4B and eIF4H as disease modifiers whose activity is important for RAN-translation of the GR peptide from G4C2-transcripts."
"Melanoma patients carry a high risk of developing brain metastases, and improvements in survival are still measured in weeks or months. Durable disease control within the brain is impeded by poor drug penetration across the blood-brain barrier, as well as intrinsic and acquired drug resistance. Augmented mitochondrial respiration is a key resistance mechanism in BRAF-mutant melanomas but, as we show in this study, this dependence on mitochondrial respiration may also be exploited therapeutically. We first used high-throughput pharmacogenomic profiling to identify potentially repurposable compounds against BRAF-mutant melanoma brain metastases. One of the compounds identified was &#x3b2;-sitosterol, a well-tolerated and brain-penetrable phytosterol. Here we show that &#x3b2;-sitosterol attenuates melanoma cell growth in vitro and also inhibits brain metastasis formation in vivo. Functional analyses indicated that the therapeutic potential of &#x3b2;-sitosterol was linked to mitochondrial interference. Mechanistically, &#x3b2;-sitosterol effectively reduced mitochondrial respiratory capacity, mediated by an inhibition of mitochondrial complex I. The net result of this action was increased oxidative stress that led to apoptosis. This effect was only seen in tumor cells, and not in normal cells. Large-scale analyses of human melanoma brain metastases indicated a significant role of mitochondrial complex I compared to brain metastases from other cancers. Finally, we observed completely abrogated BRAF inhibitor resistance when vemurafenib was combined with either &#x3b2;-sitosterol or a functional knockdown of mitochondrial complex I. In conclusion, based on its favorable tolerability, excellent brain bioavailability, and capacity to inhibit mitochondrial respiration, &#x3b2;-sitosterol represents a promising adjuvant to BRAF inhibitor therapy in patients with, or at risk for, melanoma brain metastases."
"Pediatric high grade gliomas (pHGG), including diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs), are aggressive tumors with a dismal outcome. Radiotherapy (RT) is part of the standard of care of these tumors; however, radiotherapy only leads to a transient clinical improvement. Delta-24-RGD is a genetically engineered tumor-selective adenovirus that has shown safety and clinical efficacy in adults with recurrent gliomas. In this work, we evaluated the feasibility, safety and therapeutic efficacy of Delta-24-RGD in combination with radiotherapy in pHGGs and DIPGs models. Our results showed that the combination of Delta-24-RGD with radiotherapy was feasible and resulted in a synergistic anti-glioma effect in vitro and in vivo in pHGG and DIPG models. Interestingly, Delta-24-RGD treatment led to the downregulation of relevant DNA damage repair proteins, further sensitizing tumors cells to the effect of radiotherapy. Additionally, Delta-24-RGD/radiotherapy treatment significantly increased the trafficking of immune cells (CD3, CD4+ and CD8+) to the tumor niche compared with single treatments. In summary, administration of the Delta-24-RGD/radiotherapy combination to pHGG and DIPG models is safe and significantly increases the overall survival of mice bearing these tumors. Our data offer a rationale for the combination Delta-24-RGD/radiotherapy as a therapeutic option for children with these tumors. SIGNIFICANCE: Delta-24-RGD/radiotherapy administration is safe and significantly increases the survival of treated mice. These positive data underscore the urge to translate this approach to the clinical treatment of children with pHGG and DIPGs."
"Cyclin dependent kinase-5 (cdk5)/p35 is a neuronal kinase that regulates key axonal and synaptic functions but the mechanisms by which it is transported to these locations are unknown. Lemur tyrosine kinase-2 (LMTK2) is a binding partner for p35 and here we show that LMTK2 also interacts with kinesin-1 light chains (KLC1/2). Binding to KLC1/2 involves a C-terminal tryptophan/aspartate (WD) motif in LMTK2 and the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains in KLC1/2, and this interaction facilitates axonal transport of LMTK2. Thus, siRNA loss of KLC1 or mutation of the WD motif disrupts axonal transport of LMTK2. We also show that LMTK2 facilitates the formation of a complex containing KLC1 and p35 and that siRNA loss of LMTK2 disrupts axonal transport of both p35 and cdk5. Finally, we show that LMTK2 levels are reduced in Alzheimer's disease brains. Damage to axonal transport and altered cdk5/p35 are pathogenic features of Alzheimer's disease. Thus, LMTK2 binds to KLC1 to direct axonal transport of p35 and its loss may contribute to Alzheimer's disease."
"Accumulating evidence indicates that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a common feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) and further suggests that several PD-related genes are responsible for ER dysfunction. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we defined the mechanism by which LRRK2-G2019S (LRRK2-GS), a pathogenic mutation in the PD-associated gene LRRK2, accelerates ER stress and cell death. Treatment of cells with &#x3b1;-synuclein increased the expression of ER stress proteins and subsequent cell death in LRRK2-GS astrocytes. Intriguingly, we found that LRRK2-GS localizes to the ER membrane, where it interacts with sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA) and suppress its activity by preventing displacement of phospholamban (PLN). LRRK2-GS-mediated SERCA malfunction leads to ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion, which induces the formation of mitochondria-ER contacts and subsequent Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload in mitochondria, ultimately resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction. Collectively, our data suggest that, in astrocytes, LRRK2-GS impairs ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, which determines cell survival, and as a result, could contribute to the development of PD."
"Although the precise neuropathological substrates of cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD) remain elusive, it has long been regarded that pathology in the CA2 hippocampal subfield is characteristic of Lewy body dementias, including dementia in PD (PDD). Early non-human primate tracer studies demonstrated connections from the nucleus of the vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (nvlDBB, Ch2) to the hippocampus. However, the relationship between Lewy pathology of the CA2 subfield and cholinergic fibres has not been explored. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the burden of pathology in the CA2 subsector of PD cases with varying degrees of cognitive impairment and correlated this with the extent of septohippocampal cholinergic deficit. Hippocampal sections from 67 PD, 34 PD with mild cognitive impairment and 96 PDD cases were immunostained for tau and alpha-synuclein, and the respective pathology burden was assessed semi-quantitatively. In a subset of cases, the degree of CA2 cholinergic depletion was quantified using confocal microscopy and correlated with cholinergic neuronal loss in Ch2. We found that only cases with dementia have a significantly greater Lewy pathology, whereas cholinergic fibre depletion was evident in cases with mild cognitive impairment and this was significantly correlated with loss of cholinergic neurons in Ch2. In addition, multiple antigen immunofluorescence demonstrated colocalisation between cholinergic fibres and alpha-synuclein but not tau pathology. Such specific Lewy pathology targeting the cholinergic system within the CA2 subfield may contribute to the unique memory retrieval deficit seen in patients with Lewy body disorders, as distinct from the memory storage deficit seen in Alzheimer's disease."
"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling promotes cell growth and survival and is frequently activated in infiltrative gliomas. Activating mutations in PIK3CA gene are observed in 6-15% of glioblastomas, although their clinical significance is largely undescribed. The objective of this study was to examine whether PIK3CA mutations are associated with a specific clinical phenotype in glioblastoma. We retrospectively reviewed 157 consecutive newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients from December 2009 to June 2012 who underwent molecular profiling consisting of targeted hotspot genotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization for gene amplification, and methylation-specific PCR for O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation. Molecular alterations were correlated with clinical features, imaging and outcome. The Cancer Genome Atlas data was analyzed as a validation set. There were 91 males; median age was 58&#x2009;years (range, 23-85). With a median follow-up of 20.9&#x2009;months, median progression-free survival (PFS) and estimated overall survival (OS) were 11.9 and 24.0&#x2009;months, respectively. Thirteen patients (8.3%) harbored PIK3CA mutation, which was associated with younger age (mean 49.4 vs. 58.1&#x2009;years, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). PIK3CA mutation correlated with shorter PFS (median 6.9 vs. 12.4&#x2009;months, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01) and OS (median 21.2 vs. 24.2&#x2009;months, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.049) in multivariate analysis. A significant association between PIK3CA mutation and more disseminated disease at diagnosis, as defined by gliomatosis, multicentric lesions, or distant leptomeningeal lesions, was observed (46.2% vs. 11.1%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). In conclusion, despite the association with younger age, PIK3CA activating mutations are associated with earlier recurrence and shorter survival in adult glioblastoma. The aggressive course of these tumors may be related to their propensity for disseminated presentation."
"Pituicytoma is a rare, poorly characterized tumor of the sellar region that is thought to be derived from neurohypophyseal pituicytes. Resection of pituicytomas is often associated with significant morbidity including diabetes insipidus and panhypopituitarism. Most of the literature on this tumor exists as small case series or case reports. Here we describe a cohort of fourteen pituicytoma resections from eleven patients. The average follow-up on these cases is 3.7&#x2009;years with some patients having over 10&#x2009;years of follow-up data available in the electronic medical record. Pituicytomas were frequently misdiagnosed on pre-operative imaging, and surgical resection was associated with persistent endocrine abnormalities. Histologically, the tumors showed a range of morphologies from epithelioid to spindled. All tumors were positive for TTF-1 with variable immunostaining for other markers including GFAP, EMA, S100, SSTR2A, and synaptophysin. Within this cohort are two patients with atypical pituicytomas which showed increased cellularity, pleomorphism, mitoses and elevated Ki-67 proliferation indexes when compared to non-atypical pituicytomas. Next generation sequencing performed on three tumors revealed alterations in genes involved in the MAPK pathway. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining for phosphorylated-ERK was positive in the majority of tumors. Increased awareness of the neoplastic entity and identification of targetable mutations have the potential to decrease the morbidity associated with resection of pituicytomas."
"The expansion of a hexanucleotide repeat GGGGCC in C9orf72 is the most common known cause of ALS accounting for ~&#x2009;40% familial cases and ~&#x2009;7% sporadic cases in the European population. In most people, the repeat length is 2, but in people with ALS, hundreds to thousands of repeats may be observed. A small proportion of people have an intermediate expansion, of the order of 20 to 30 repeats in size, and it remains unknown whether intermediate expansions confer risk of ALS in the same way that massive expansions do. We investigated the association of this intermediate repeat with ALS by performing a meta-analysis of four previously published studies and a new British/Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset of 1295 cases and 613 controls. The final dataset comprised 5071 cases and 3747 controls. Our meta-analysis showed association between ALS and intermediate C9orf72 repeats of 24 to 30 repeats in size (random-effects model OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.2, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.23-14.35, p-value&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). Furthermore, we showed a different frequency of the repeat between the northern and southern European populations (Fisher's exact test p-value&#x2009;=&#x2009;5&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;10<sup>-&#x2009;3</sup>). Our findings provide evidence for the association between intermediate repeats and ALS (p-value&#x2009;=&#x2009;2&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;10<sup>-&#x2009;4</sup>) with direct relevance for research and clinical practice by showing that an expansion of 24 or more repeats should be considered pathogenic."
"Tau is a microtubule stabilizing protein that forms aggregates in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau derived from AD patients' brains induces tau aggregation in a prion-like manner when injected into susceptible mouse models.Here we investigated whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from patients diagnosed with probable AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) likely due to AD harbors a prion-like tau seeding potential. CSF was injected intrahippocampally into young P301S tau transgenic mice. CSF obtained from AD or MCI patients increased hippocampal tau hyperphosphorylation and tau tangle formation in these mice at 4&#x2009;months post-seeding. Tau pathology was also accentuated in the contralateral hippocampus, and in anterior and posterior directions, indicative of spreading.We provide first evidence for in vivo prion-like properties of AD patients' CSF, accelerating tau pathology in susceptible tau transgenic mice. This demonstrates that biologically active tau seeds reach the CSF compartment in AD. Further studies may help to evaluate strain specific properties of CSF derived tau bioseeds, and to assess their diagnostic potential."
"Pathogenic variants of the huntingtin (HTT) protein and their aggregation have been investigated in great detail in brains of Huntington's disease patients and HTT-transgenic animals. However, little is known about the physiological brain region- and cell type-specific HTT expression pattern in wild type mice and a potential recruitment of endogenous HTT to other pathogenic protein aggregates such as amyloid plaques in cross seeding events. Employing a monoclonal anti-HTT antibody directed against the HTT mid-region and using brain tissue of three different mouse strains, we detected prominent immunoreactivity in a number of brain areas, particularly in cholinergic cranial nerve nuclei, while ubiquitous neuronal staining appeared faint. The region-specific distribution of endogenous HTT was found to be comparable in wild type rat and hamster brain. In human amyloid precursor protein transgenic Tg2576 mice with amyloid plaque pathology, similar neuronal HTT expression patterns and a distinct association of HTT with Abeta plaques were revealed by immunohistochemical double labelling. Additionally, the localization of HTT in reactive astrocytes was demonstrated for the first time in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease animal model. Both, plaque association of HTT and occurrence in astrocytes appeared to be age-dependent. Astrocytic HTT gene and protein expression was confirmed in primary cultures by RT-qPCR and by immunocytochemistry. We provide the first detailed analysis of physiological HTT expression in rodent brain and, under pathological conditions, demonstrate HTT aggregation in proximity to Abeta plaques and Abeta-induced astrocytic expression of endogenous HTT in Tg2576 mice."
"Redistribution of the water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) away from astrocyte endfeet and into parenchymal processes is a striking histological feature in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurological conditions with prominent astrogliosis. AQP4 redistribution has been proposed to impair bulk A&#x3b2; clearance in AD, resulting in increased amyloid deposition in the brain; however, this finding is controversial. Here, we provide evidence in support of a different and novel role of AQP4 in AD. We found that Aqp4 deletion significantly increased amyloid deposition in cerebral cortex of 5xFAD mice, with an increase in the relative number of fibrillar vs. dense core plaques. AQP4 deficient 5xFAD mice also showed a significant reduction in the density of GFAP labeled peri-plaque astrocyte processes. Microglial plaque coverage was also significantly reduced, suggesting astrocyte involvement in organizing the peri-plaque glial response. The alterations in peri-plaque glial structure were accompanied by increased neuronal uptake of A&#x3b2; and an increase in the number of dystrophic neurites surrounding plaques. On the basis of these findings, we propose that redistribution of AQP4 into the parenchymal processes facilitates astrocyte structural plasticity and the formation of a reactive glial net around plaques that protects neurons from the deleterious effects of A&#x3b2; aggregates. AQP4 redistribution may thus facilitate plaque containment and reduce neuropathology in AD."
"Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) is a severe neurodegenerative disease clinically characterized by parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, dysautonomia and other motor and non-motor symptoms.Although several efforts have been dedicated to understanding the causative mechanisms of the disease, MSA pathogenesis remains widely unknown.The aim of the present review is to describe the state of the art about MSA pathogenesis, with a particular focus on alpha-synuclein accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction, and to highlight future possible perspectives in this field.In particular, this review describes the most widely investigated hypotheses explaining alpha-synuclein accumulation in oligodendrocytes, including SNCA expression, neuron-oligodendrocyte protein transfer, impaired protein degradation and alpha-synuclein spread mechanisms.Afterwards, several recent achievements in MSA research involving mitochondrial biology are described, including the role of COQ2 mutations, Coenzyme Q10 reduction, respiratory chain dysfunction and altered mitochondrial mass.Some hints are provided about alternative pathogenic mechanisms, including inflammation and impaired autophagy.Finally, all these findings are discussed from a comprehensive point of view, putative explanations are provided and new research perspectives are suggested.Overall, the present review provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the mechanisms underlying MSA pathogenesis."
"The recently described malignant neuro-epithelial tumors with histone H3F3A point mutations at G34 (NET-H3-G34) occur most often in cerebral hemispheres of teenagers and young adults, and have a generally adverse prognosis. These tumors have been histologically classified as glioblastoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) in the past, and have not been defined as a separate entity in the revised WHO classification of tumors of the CNS 2016. Here, we report two cases of NET-H3-G34 with glial and dysplastic ganglion cell components affecting teenagers. Patients were treated with surgery and radiochemotherapy with temozolomide. One patient underwent partial resection and deceased 21&#x2009;months after diagnosis, while the other patient is alive without evidence of disease 15&#x2009;months after total resection. So far, a dysplastic ganglion cell component has not been described in NET-H-G34, and its presence raises a possible relation to (anaplastic) gangliogliomas. Genome-wide copy number analysis did not provide unequivocal evidence that these tumors represent anaplastic variants of gangliogliomas, as opposed to NET-H3-G34. Our observations expand the morphologic spectrum of NET-H3-G34. Further cases of NET-H3-G34 with dysplastic ganglion cells should be clinically followed to find differences or similarities in their biological behavior, as compared to NET-H3-G34 and anaplastic gangliogliomas."
"Despite their phenotypic heterogeneity, most human prion diseases belong to two broadly defined groups: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and Gerstmann-Str&#xe4;ussler-Scheinker disease (GSS). While the structural characteristics of the disease-related proteinase K-resistant prion protein (resPrP<sup>D</sup>) associated with the CJD group are fairly well established, many features of GSS-associated resPrP<sup>D</sup> are unclear. Electrophoretic profiles of resPrP<sup>D</sup> associated with GSS variants typically show 6-8&#x2009;kDa bands corresponding to the internal PrP fragments as well as a variable number of higher molecular weight bands, the molecular nature of which has not been investigated. Here we have performed systematic studies of purified resPrP<sup>D</sup> species extracted from GSS cases with the A117V (GSS<sup>A117V</sup>) and F198S (GSS<sup>F198S</sup>) PrP gene mutations. The combined analysis based on epitope mapping, deglycosylation treatment and direct amino acid sequencing by mass spectrometry provided a conclusive evidence that high molecular weight resPrP<sup>D</sup> species seen in electrophoretic profiles represent covalently-linked multimers of the internal ~&#x2009;7 and ~&#x2009;8&#x2009;kDa fragments. This finding reveals a mechanism of resPrP<sup>D</sup> aggregate formation that has not been previously established in prion diseases."
"Choroid plexus tumours (CPTs) account for 2-5% of brain tumours in children. They can spread along the neuraxis and can recur after treatment. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation and only few high fidelity mouse models of p53-deficient malignant CPTs are available.We show here that c-MYC overexpression in the choroid plexus epithelium induces T-cell inflammation-dependent choroid plexus papillomas in a mouse model. We demonstrate that c-MYC is expressed in a substantial proportion of human choroid plexus tumours and that this subgroup of tumours is characterised by an inflammatory transcriptome and significant inflammatory infiltrates. In compound mutant mice, overexpression of c-MYC in an immunodeficient background led to a decreased incidence of CPP and reduced tumour bulk. Finally, reduced tumour size was also observed upon T-cell depletion in CPP-bearing mice. Our data raise the possibility that benign choroid plexus tumours expressing c-MYC could be amenable to medical therapy with anti-inflammatory drugs."
"Mitochondria are critical for the function and maintenance of myelinated axons notably through Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. A direct by-product of this ATP production is reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are highly deleterious for neurons. While ATP shortage and ROS levels increase are involved in several neurodegenerative diseases, it is still unclear whether the real-time dynamics of both ATP and ROS production in axonal mitochondria are altered by axonal or demyelinating neuropathies. To answer this question, we imaged and quantified mitochondrial ATP and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in resting or stimulated peripheral nerve myelinated axons in vivo, using genetically-encoded fluorescent probes, two-photon time-lapse and CARS imaging. We found that ATP and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> productions are intrinsically higher in nodes of Ranvier even in resting conditions. Axonal firing increased both ATP and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> productions but with different dynamics: ROS production peaked shortly and transiently after the stimulation while ATP production increased gradually for a longer period of time. In neuropathic MFN2<sup>R94Q</sup> mice, mimicking Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2A disease, defective mitochondria failed to upregulate ATP production following axonal activity. However, elevated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production was largely sustained. Finally, inducing demyelination with lysophosphatidylcholine resulted in a reduced level of ATP while H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> level soared. Taken together, our results suggest that ATP and ROS productions are decoupled under neuropathic conditions, which may compromise axonal function and integrity."
"Therapeutic developments for neurodegenerative disorders are redirecting their focus to the mechanisms that contribute to neuronal connectivity and the loss thereof. Using a high-throughput microscopy pipeline that integrates morphological and functional measurements, we found that inhibition of dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) increased neuronal connectivity in primary cortical cultures. This neuroprotective effect was not only observed in basal conditions but also in cultures depleted from antioxidants and in cultures in which microtubule stability was genetically perturbed. Based on&#xa0;the morphofunctional connectivity signature, we further showed that the effects were limited to a specific dose and time range. Thus, our results illustrate that profiling microscopy images with deep coverage enables sensitive interrogation of neuronal connectivity and allows exposing a pharmacological window for targeted treatments. In doing so, we revealed a broad-spectrum neuroprotective effect of DLK inhibition, which may have relevance to pathological conditions that ar.e associated with compromised neuronal connectivity."
"Since the discovery that IDH1/2 mutations confer a significantly better prognosis in astrocytomas, much work has been done to identify other molecular signatures to help further stratify lower-grade astrocytomas and glioblastomas, with the goal of accurately predicting clinical outcome and identifying potentially targetable mutations. In the present study, we subclassify 135 astrocytomas (67 IDH-wildtype and 68 IDH-mutant) from The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset (TCGA) on the basis of grade, IDH-status, and the previously established prognostic factors, CDK4 amplification and CDKN2A/B deletion, within the IDH-mutant groups. We analyzed these groups for total copy number variation (CNV), total mutation burden, chromothripsis, specific mutations, and amplifications/deletions of specific genes/chromosomal regions. Herein, we demonstrate that across all of these tumor groups, total CNV level is a relatively consistent prognostic factor. We also identified a trend towards increased levels of chromothripsis in tumors with lower progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) intervals. While no significant differences were identified in overall mutation load, we did identify a significantly higher number of cases with mutations in genes with functions related to maintaining genomic stability in groups with higher mean CNV and worse PFS and OS intervals, particularly in the IDH-mutant groups. Our data further support the case for total CNV level as a potential prognostic factor in astrocytomas, and suggest mutations in genes responsible for overall genomic instability as a possible underlying mechanism for some astrocytomas with poor clinical outcome."
"The diagnosis and prognostication of glioblastoma (GBM) remain to be solely dependent on histopathological findings and few molecular markers, despite the clinical heterogeneity in this entity. To address this issue, we investigated the prognostic impact of copy number alterations (CNAs) using two population-based IDH-wild-type GBM cohorts: an original Japanese cohort and a dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The molecular disproportions between these cohorts were dissected in light of cohort differences in GBM. The Japanese cohort was collected from cases registered in Kansai Molecular Diagnosis Network for CNS tumors (KNBTG). The somatic landscape around CNAs was analyzed for 212 KNBTG cases and 359 TCGA cases. Next, the clinical impacts of CNA profiles were investigated for 140 KNBTG cases and 152 TCGA cases treated by standard adjuvant therapy using temozolomide-based chemoradiation. The comparative profiling indicated unequal distribution of specific CNAs such as EGFR, CDKN2A, and PTEN among the two cohorts. Especially, the triple overlap CNAs in these loci (triple CNA) were much higher in frequency in TCGA (70.5%) than KNBTG (24.3%), and its prognostic impact was independently validated in both cohorts. The KNBTG cohort significantly showed better prognosis than the TCGA cohort (median overall survival 19.3 vs 15.6&#x2009;months). This survival difference between the two cohorts completely resolved after subclassifying all cases according to the triple CNA status. The prognostic significance of triple CNA was identified in IDH-wild-type GBM. Distribution difference in prognostic CNA profiles potentially could cause survival differences across cohorts in clinical studies."
"Dysregulation of epigenetic mechanisms is emerging as a central event in neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In many models of neurodegeneration, global histone acetylation is decreased in the affected neuronal tissues. Histone acetylation is controlled by the antagonistic actions of two protein families -the histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and the histone deacetylases (HDACs). Drugs inhibiting HDAC activity are already used in the clinic as anti-cancer agents. The aim of this study was to explore the therapeutic potential of HDAC inhibition in the context of ALS. We discovered that transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type FUS (""Tg FUS+/+""), which recapitulate many aspects of human ALS, showed reduced global histone acetylation and alterations in metabolic gene expression, resulting in a dysregulated metabolic homeostasis. Chronic treatment of Tg FUS+/+ mice with ACY-738, a potent HDAC inhibitor that can cross the blood-brain barrier, ameliorated the motor phenotype and substantially extended the life span of the Tg FUS+/+ mice. At the molecular level, ACY-738 restored global histone acetylation and metabolic gene expression, thereby re-establishing metabolite levels in the spinal cord. Taken together, our findings link epigenetic alterations to metabolic dysregulation in ALS pathology, and highlight ACY-738 as a potential therapeutic strategy to treat this devastating disease."
"Tauopathies are a heterogenous class of diseases characterized by cellular accumulation of aggregated tau and include diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Tau pathology is strongly linked to neurodegeneration and clinical symptoms in tauopathy patients. Furthermore, synapse loss is an early pathological event in tauopathies and is the strongest correlate of cognitive decline. Tau pathology is additionally associated with chronic neuroinflammatory processes, such as reactive microglia, astrocytes, and increased levels of pro-inflammatory molecules (e.g. complement proteins, cytokines). Recent studies show that as the principal immune cells of the brain, microglia play a particularly important role in the initiation and progression of tau pathology and associated neurodegeneration. Furthermore, AD risk genes&#xa0;such as&#xa0;Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and Apolipoprotein E (APOE)&#xa0;are enriched in the innate immune system and modulate the neuroinflammatory response of microglia to tau pathology. Microglia can play an active role in synaptic dysfunction by abnormally phagocytosing synaptic compartments of neurons with tau pathology. Furthermore, microglia are involved in synaptic spreading of tau - a process which is thought to underlie the progressive nature of tau pathology propagation through the brain. Spreading of pathological tau is also the predominant target for tau-based immunotherapy. Active tau vaccines, therapeutic tau antibodies and other approaches targeting the immune system are actively explored as treatment options for AD and other tauopathies. This review describes the role of microglia in the pathobiology of tauopathies and the mechanism of action of potential therapeutics targeting the immune system in tauopathies."
"Ubiquilin-2 (UBQLN2) is a member of the ubiquilin family, actively implicated in the degradation of misfolded and redundant proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome system and macroautophagy. UBQLN2 received much attention after the discovery of gene mutations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD). The abnormal presence of positive UBQLN2 inclusion in the cytosol of degenerating motor neurons of familial and sporadic forms of ALS patients has been newly related to neurodegeneration. Only recently, data have emerged on its role in liquid-liquid phase separation, in stress granule development and in the formation of secondary amyloid structures. Furthermore, several animal models are available to investigate its involvement in TDP-43 pathology and neuroinflammation in ALS. This review addresses the molecular pathogenetic pathways involving UBQLN2 abnormalities which are converging toward defects in clearance mechanisms. UBQLN2."
"Acetylsalicylic acid has been linked to a lower risk for different cancer types, presumably through its inhibitory effect on cyclooxygenase 2. This has also been investigated in vestibular schwannomas with promising results suggesting an antiproliferative effect and recently the intake has been recommended for vestibular schwannomas as a conservative treatment option. We constructed tissue microarrays from paraffin-embedded tissue samples of 1048 vestibular schwannomas and analyzed the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 and the proliferation marker MIB1 (Molecular Immunology Borstel) via immunohistochemistry together with clinical data (age, gender, tumor extension, prior radiotherapy, neurofibromatosis type 2, tumor recurrence, cyclooxygenase 2 responsive medication). Univariate analysis showed that cyclooxygenase 2 expression was increased with age, female gender, prior radiotherapy and larger tumor extension. MIB1 expression was also associated with higher cyclooxygenase 2 expression. Schwannomas of neurofibromatosis type 2 patients had lower cyclooxygenase 2 levels. Use of acetylsalicylic acid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressants did not show differences in cyclooxygenase 2 or MIB1 expression. Instead, cyclooxygenase 2 expression increases with tumor extension while MIB1 expression is not associated with tumor size. Overall, cyclooxygenase 2 expression is associated with proliferation but not influenced by regular intake of acetylsalicylic acid or other cyclooxygenase 2-responsive medications. Acetylsalicylic acid intake does not alter cyclooxygenase 2 expression and has no antiproliferative effect in vestibular."
"Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Involuntary movements, cognitive impairment and psychiatric disturbance are the major clinical manifestations, and gradual atrophy and selective neuronal loss in the striatum and cerebral cortex are the pathologic hallmarks. HD is caused by expanded CAG trinucleotide repeats at the N-terminus of IT15 that encodes the huntingtin (HTT) protein, though the molecular mechanisms through which the mutant HTT (mHTT) exerts toxic effects remain obscure. Members of the caspase family, including caspase-2 (Casp2), play an important role in HD pathogenesis. Genetic ablation of Casp2 ameliorates cognitive and motor deficits of HD mice, though the molecular targets of Casp2 are still unclear. It is well established that the microtubule-associated protein tau potentiates cognitive dysfunction in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including HD. Our recent study indicates that Casp2-catalyzed tau cleavage at aspartate 314 (tau 2N4R isoform numbering system) mediates synaptotoxicity, cognitive deficits and neurodegeneration in cellular and mouse models of frontotemporal dementia; further, levels of &#x394;tau314, the soluble, N-terminal cleavage product, are elevated in individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, compared with cognitively normal individuals. Here, we identified the presence of &#x394;tau314 proteins in the striatum (caudate nucleus) and prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 8/9) of human subjects, and showed that in both structures, levels of Casp2 and &#x394;tau314 proteins correlate well, and both proteins are higher in HD patients than non-HD individuals. Our findings advance our understanding of the contribution of Casp2-mediated &#x394;tau314 production to HD pathogenesis."
"Cellular injury in AQP4-IgG seropositive neuromyelitis spectrum disorder (herein called NMO) involves AQP4-IgG binding to astrocytes, resulting in astrocyte injury by complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mechanisms. The rapid disease progression, severe tissue damage, and abundant leukocyte infiltration seen in some NMO patients suggest a more direct mechanism for demyelination and neurologic deficit than secondary injury from astrocyte loss. Here, we report evidence for an 'ADCC bystander mechanism' in NMO involving injury to nearby cells by leukocytes following their activation by AQP4-bound AQP4-IgG on astrocytes. In model cocultures containing AQP4-expressing and null CHO cells, AQP4-IgG and complement killed bystander null cells to ~&#x2009;100&#x2009;&#x3bc;m away from AQP4-expressing cells; AQP4-IgG and NK cells produced bystander killing to ~&#x2009;300&#x2009;&#x3bc;m, with perforin deposition seen on injured null cells. Bystander cytotoxicity was also seen with neutrophil-mediated ADCC and in astrocyte-neuron cocultures. Mechanistic studies, including real-time imaging, suggested that leukocytes activated by an AQP4-dependent ADCC mechanism injure bystander cells by direct targeted exocytosis on neighboring cells and not by diffusion of soluble granule contents. In support of this conclusion, ADCC bystander injury was preferentially reduced by an RGDS peptide that inhibits integrin adhesion. Evidence for ADCC bystander injury to oligodendrocytes and neurons was also found in mice following intracerebral injection of AQP4-IgG and NK cells, which was inhibited by RGDS peptide. These results establish a novel cellular pathogenesis mechanism in AQP4-IgG seropositive NMO and provide evidence that inflammatory mechanisms can cause widespread tissue damage in NMO independently of the secondary effects from astrocyte loss."
"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the clinical triad of parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia and autonomic failure, impacting on striatonigral, olivopontocerebellar and autonomic systems. At early stage of the disease, the clinical symptoms of MSA can overlap with those of Parkinson's disease (PD). The key pathological hallmark of MSA is the presence of glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCI) in oligodendrocytes. GCI comprise insoluble proteinaceous filaments composed chiefly of &#x3b1;-synuclein aggregates, and therefore MSA is regarded as an &#x3b1;-synucleinopathy along with PD and dementia with Lewy bodies. The etiology of MSA is unknown, and the pathogenesis of MSA is still largely speculative. Much data suggests that MSA is a sporadic disease, although some emerging evidence suggests rare genetic variants increase susceptibility. Currently, there is no general consensus on the susceptibility genes as there have been differences due to geographical distribution or ethnicity. Furthermore, many of the reported studies have been conducted on patients that were only clinically diagnosed without pathological verification. The purpose of this review is to bring together available evidence to cross-examine the susceptibility genes and genetic pathomechanisms implicated in MSA. We explore the possible involvement of the SNCA, COQ2, MAPT, GBA1, LRRK2 and C9orf72 genes in MSA pathogenesis, highlight the under-explored areas of MSA genetics, and discuss future directions of research in MSA."
"Pathologically altered tau protein is a common denominator of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Therefore, promising immunotherapeutic approaches target and eliminate extracellular pathogenic tau species, which are thought to be responsible for seeding and propagation of tau pathology. Tau isoforms in misfolded states can propagate disease pathology in a template-dependent manner, proposed to be mediated by the release and internalization of extracellular tau. Monoclonal antibody DC8E8, binding four highly homologous and independent epitopes in microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) of diseased tau, inhibits tau-tau interaction, discriminates between healthy and pathologically truncated tau and reduces tau pathology in animal model in vivo. Here, we show that DC8E8 antibody acts via extracellular mechanism and does not influence viability and physiological functions of neurons. Importantly, in vitro functional assays showed that DC8E8 recognises pathogenic tau proteins of different size and origin, and potently blocks their entry into neurons. Next, we examined the mechanisms by which mouse antibody DC8E8 and its humanized version AX004 effectively block the neuronal internalization of extracellular AD tau species. We determined a novel mode of action of a therapeutic candidate antibody, which potently inhibits neuronal internalization of AD tau species by masking of epitopes present in MTBD important for interaction with neuron surface Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans (HSPGs). We show that interference of tau-heparane sulfate interaction with DC8E8 antibody via steric hindrance represents an efficient and important therapeutic approach halting tau propagation."

"Epithelioid glioblastoma is a rare aggressive variant of glioblastoma (GBM) characterized by a dismal prognosis of about 6&#x2009;months and frequent leptomeningeal dissemination. A recent study has revealed that 50% of epithelioid GBMs harbor three genetic alterations - BRAF V600E mutation, TERT promoter mutations, and homozygous deletions of CDKN2A/2B. Emerging evidence support the effectiveness of targeted therapies for brain tumors with BRAF V600E mutation. Here we describe a dramatic radiographical response to combined therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors in a patient with epithelioid GBM harboring BRAF V600E mutation, characterized by thick spinal dissemination. From relapsed tumor procured at autopsy, we established a cell line retaining the BRAF V600E mutation, TERT promoter mutation and CDKN2A/2B loss. Intracranial implantation of these cells into mice resulted in tumors closely resembling the original, characterized by epithelioid tumor cells and dissemination, and invasion into the perivascular spaces. We then confirmed the efficacy of treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo. Epithelioid GBM with BRAF V600E mutation can be considered a good treatment indication for precision medicine, and this patient-derived cell line should be useful for prediction of the tumor response and clarification of its biological characteristics."
"The BRAF gene and the TERT promoter are among the most frequently altered genomic loci in low-grade (LGG) and high-grade-glioma (HGG), respectively. The coexistence of BRAF and TERT promoter aberrations characterizes a subset of aggressive glioma. Therefore, we investigated interactions between those alterations in malignant glioma. We analyzed co-occurrence of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and TERT promoter mutations in our clinical data (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8) in addition to published datasets (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;103) and established a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-positive glioma cell panel (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;9) for in vitro analyses. We investigated altered gene expression, signaling events and TERT promoter activity upon BRAF- and E-twenty-six (ETS)-factor inhibition by qRT-PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), Western blots and luciferase reporter assays. TERT promoter mutations were significantly enriched in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mutated HGG as compared to BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mutated LGG. In vitro, BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>/TERT promoter double-mutant glioma cells showed exceptional sensitivity towards BRAF-targeting agents. Remarkably, BRAF-inhibition attenuated TERT expression and TERT promoter activity exclusively in double-mutant models, while TERT expression was undetectable in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-only cells. Various ETS-factors were broadly expressed, however, only ETS1 expression and phosphorylation were consistently downregulated following BRAF-inhibition. Knock-down experiments and ChIP corroborated the notion of a functional role for ETS1 and, accordingly, all double-mutant tumor cells were highly sensitive towards the ETS-factor inhibitor YK-4-279. In conclusion, our data suggest that concomitant BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and TERT promoter mutations synergistically support cancer cell proliferation and immortalization. ETS1 links these two driver alterations functionally and may represent a promising therapeutic target in this aggressive glioma subgroup."
"Intracellular mislocalization of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a nuclear DNA/RNA-binding protein involved in RNA metabolism, is a pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although the aggregation-prone, TDP-43 C-terminal domain is widely considered as a key component of TDP-43 pathology in ALS, recent studies including ours suggest that TDP-43&#x2009;N-terminal fragments (TDP-&#x2206;C) may also contribute to the motor dysfunction in ALS. However, the specific pathological functions of TDP-43&#x2009;N-terminal fragments in mice have not been elucidated. Here, we established TDP-&#x2206;C knock-in mice missing a part of exon 6 of murine Tardbp gene, which encodes the C-terminal region of TDP-43. Homozygous TDP-&#x2206;C mice showed embryonic lethality, indicating that the N-terminal domain of TDP-43 alone is not sufficient for normal development. In contrast, heterozygous TDP-&#x2206;C mice developed normally but exhibited age-dependent mild motor dysfunction with a loss of C-boutons, large cholinergic synaptic terminals on spinal &#x3b1;-motor neurons. TDP-&#x2206;C protein broadly perturbed gene expression in the spinal cords of aged heterozygous TDP-&#x2206;C mice, including downregulation of Notch1 mRNA. Moreover, the level of Notch1 mRNA was suppressed both by TDP-43 depletion and TDP-&#x2206;C expression in Neuro2a cells. Decreased Notch1 mRNA expression in aged TDP-&#x2206;C mice was associated with the age-dependent motor dysfunction and loss of Akt surviving signal. Our findings indicate that the N-terminal region of TDP-43 derived from TDP-&#x2206;C induces the age-dependent motor dysfunction associated with impaired Notch1-Akt axis in mice."
"Soluble aggregates of amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) have been associated with neuronal and synaptic loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, despite significant recent progress, the mechanisms by which these aggregated species contribute to disease progression are not fully determined. As the analysis of human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provides an accessible window into the molecular changes associated with the disease progression, we characterised soluble aggregates present in CSF samples from individuals with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls using a range of sensitive biophysical methods. We used super-resolution imaging and atomic force microscopy to characterise the size and structure of the aggregates present in CSF and correlate this with their ability to permeabilise lipid membranes and induce an inflammatory response. We found that these aggregates are extremely heterogeneous and exist in a range of sizes, varying both structurally and in their mechanisms of toxicity during the disease progression. A higher proportion of small aggregates of A&#x3b2; that can cause membrane permeabilization are found in MCI CSF; in established AD, a higher proportion of the aggregates were larger and more prone to elicit a pro-inflammatory response in glial cells, while there was no detectable change in aggregate concentration. These results show that large aggregates, some longer than 100&#x2009;nm, are present in the CSF of AD patients and suggest that different neurotoxic mechanisms are prevalent at different stages of AD."
"Activated myeloid cells and astrocytes are the predominant cell types in active multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions. Both cell types can adopt diverse functional states that play critical roles in lesion formation and resolution. In order to identify phenotypic subsets of myeloid cells and astrocytes, we profiled two active MS lesions with thirteen glial activation markers using imaging mass cytometry (IMC), a method for multiplexed labeling of histological sections. In the acutely demyelinating lesion, we found multiple distinct myeloid and astrocyte phenotypes that populated separate lesion zones. In the post-demyelinating lesion, phenotypes were less distinct and more uniformly distributed. In both lesions cell-to-cell interactions were not random, but occurred between specific glial subpopulations and lymphocytes. Finally, we demonstrated that myeloid, but not astrocyte phenotypes were activated along a lesion rim-to-center gradient, and that marker expression in glial cells at the lesion rim was driven more by cell-extrinsic factors than in cells at the center. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that highly multiplexed tissue imaging, combined with the appropriate computational tools, is a powerful approach to study heterogeneity, spatial distribution and cellular interactions in the context of MS lesions. Identifying glial phenotypes and their interactions at different lesion stages may provide novel therapeutic targets for inhibiting acute demyelination and low-grade, chronic inflammation."

"Recessive mutations in PYROXD1, encoding an oxidoreductase, were recently reported in families with congenital myopathy or limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Here we describe three novel PYROXD1 families at the clinical, histological, and genetic level. Histological analyses on muscle biopsies from all families revealed fiber size variability, endomysial fibrosis, and muscle fibers with multiple internal nuclei and cores. Further characterization of the structural muscle defects uncovered aggregations of myofibrillar proteins, and provided evidence for enhanced oxidative stress. Sequencing identified homozygous or compound heterozygous PYROXD1 mutations including the first deep intronic mutation reinforcing a cryptic donor splice site and resulting in mRNA instability through exonisation of an intronic segment. Overall, this work expands the PYROXD1 mutation spectrum, defines and specifies the histopathological hallmarks of the disorder, and indicates that oxidative stress contributes to the pathomechanism. Comparison of all new and published cases uncovered a genotype/phenotype correlation with a more severe and early-onset phenotypic presentation of patients harboring splice mutations resulting in reduced PYROXD1 protein levels compared with patients carrying missense mutations."
"CGG repeat expansions in FMR1 cause the neurodegenerative disorder Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS). Ubiquitinated neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs) are the neuropathological hallmark of FXTAS. Both sense strand derived CGG repeats and antisense strand derived CCG repeats support non-AUG initiated (RAN) translation of homopolymeric proteins in potentially 6 different reading frames. However, the relative abundance of these proteins in FXTAS brains and their co-localization with each other and NIIs is lacking. Here we describe rater-blinded assessment of immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining with newly generated antibodies to different CGG RAN translation products in FXTAS and control brains as well as co-staining with ubiquitin, p62/SQSTM1, and ubiquilin 2. We find that both FMRpolyG and a second CGG repeat derived RAN translation product, FMRpolyA, accumulate in aggregates in FXTAS brains. FMRpolyG is a near-obligate component of both ubiquitin-positive and p62-positive NIIs in FXTAS, with occurrence of aggregates in 20% of all hippocampal neurons and&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;90% of all inclusions. A subset of these inclusions also stain positive for the ALS/FTD associated protein ubiquilin 2. Ubiquitinated inclusions and FMRpolyG+ aggregates are rarer in cortex and cerebellum. Intriguingly, FMRpolyG staining is also visible in control neuronal nuclei. In contrast to FMRpolyG, staining for FMRpolyA and CCG antisense derived RAN translation products were less abundant and less frequent components of ubiquitinated inclusions. In conclusion, RAN translated FMRpolyG is a common component of ubiquitin and p62 positive inclusions in FXTAS patient brains."
"Ischemic injury to white matter tracts is increasingly recognized to play a key role in age-related cognitive decline, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. Knowledge of the effects of ischemic axonal injury on cortical neurons is limited yet critical to identifying molecular pathways that link neurodegeneration and ischemia. Using a mouse model of subcortical white matter ischemic injury coupled with retrograde neuronal tracing, we employed magnetic affinity cell sorting with fluorescence-activated cell sorting to capture layer-specific cortical neurons and performed RNA-sequencing. With this approach, we identified a role for microtubule reorganization within stroke-injured neurons acting through the regulation of tau. We find that subcortical stroke-injured Layer 5 cortical neurons up-regulate the microtubule affinity-regulating kinase, Mark4, in response to axonal injury. Stroke-induced up-regulation of Mark4 is associated with selective remodeling of the apical dendrite after stroke and the phosphorylation of tau in vivo. In a cell-based tau biosensor assay, Mark4 promotes the aggregation of human tau in vitro. Increased expression of Mark4 after ischemic axonal injury in deep layer cortical neurons provides new evidence for synergism between axonal and neurodegenerative pathologies by priming of tau phosphorylation and aggregation."

"Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignancy in children. We previously found that the ACVR1C/SMAD2 pathway is significantly upregulated in invasive retinoblastoma samples from patients. Here we studied the role of an ACVR1C ligand, Nodal, in regulating growth and metastatic dissemination in retinoblastoma. Inhibition of Nodal using multiple short hairpin (shRNAs) in WERI Rb1 and Y79 retinoblastoma cell cultures reduced growth by more than 90%, as determined by CCK-8 growth assay. Proliferation was also significantly inhibited, as found by Ki67 assay. These effects were paralleled by inhibition in the phosphorylation of the downstream effector SMAD2, as well as induction of apoptosis, as we observed more than three-fold increase in the percentage of cells positive for cleaved-caspase-3 or expressing cleaved-PARP1. Importantly, we found that downregulation of Nodal potently suppressed invasion in vitro, by 50 to 80%, as determined by transwell invasion assay (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). Using an orthotopic model of retinoblastoma in zebrafish, we found 34% reduction in the ability of the cells to disseminate outside the eye, when Nodal was knocked down by shRNA (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0003). These data suggest that Nodal plays an important role in promoting growth, proliferation and invasion in retinoblastoma, and can be considered a new therapeutic target for both primary tumor growth and metastatic progression."
"The protein &#x3b1;-synuclein (&#x3b1;syn) forms pathologic aggregates in a number of neurodegenerative diseases including Lewy body dementia (LBD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). It is unclear why diseases such as LBD may develop widespread &#x3b1;syn pathology, while in Alzheimer's disease with amygdala restricted Lewy bodies (AD/ALB) the &#x3b1;syn aggregates remain localized. The amygdala contains &#x3b1;syn aggregates in both LBD and in AD/ALB; to understand why &#x3b1;syn pathology continues to progress in LBD but not in AD/ALB, tissue from the amygdala and other regions were obtained from 14 cases of LBD, 9 cases of AD/ALB, and 4 controls for immunohistochemical and biochemical characterization. Utilizing a panel of previously characterized &#x3b1;syn antibodies, numerous unique pathologies differentiating LBD and AD/ALB were revealed; particularly the presence of dense neuropil &#x3b1;syn aggregates, astrocytic &#x3b1;syn, and &#x3b1;syn-containing dystrophic neurites within senile plaques. Within LBD, these unique pathologies were predominantly present within the amygdala. Biochemically, the amygdala in LBD prominently contained specific carboxy-truncated forms of &#x3b1;syn which are highly prone to aggregate, suggesting that the amygdala may be prone to initiate development of &#x3b1;syn pathology. Similar to carboxy-truncated &#x3b1;syn, it was demonstrated herein that the presence of aggregation prone A53T &#x3b1;syn is sufficient to drive misfolding of wild-type &#x3b1;syn in human disease. Overall, this study identifies within the amygdala in LBD the presence of unique strain-like variation in &#x3b1;syn pathology that may be a determinant of disease progression."

"Neuropathological follow-up of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who participated in the first clinical trial of Amyloid-&#x3b2; 42 (A&#x3b2;42) immunization (AN1792, Elan Pharmaceuticals) has shown that immunization can induce removal of A&#x3b2;42 and A&#x3b2;40 from plaques, whereas analysis of the cerebral vessels has shown increased levels of these A&#x3b2; peptides in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). A&#x3b2;43 has been less frequently studied in AD, but its aggregation propensity and neurotoxic properties suggest it may have an important pathogenic role. In the current study we show by using immunohistochemistry that in unimmunized AD patients A&#x3b2;43 is a frequent constituent of plaques (6.0% immunostained area), similar to A&#x3b2;42 (3.9% immunostained area). A&#x3b2;43 immunostained area was significantly higher than that of A&#x3b2;40 (2.3%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006). In addition, we show that A&#x3b2;43 is only a minor component of CAA in both parenchymal vessels (1.5 A&#x3b2;43-positive vessels per cm<sup>2</sup> cortex vs. 5.3 A&#x3b2;42-positive vessels, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03, and 6.2 A&#x3b2;40-positive vessels, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.045) and leptomeningeal vessels (5.6% A&#x3b2;43-positive vessels vs. 17.3% A&#x3b2;42-positive vessels, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007, and 27.4% A&#x3b2;40-positive vessels, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003). Furthermore, we have shown that A&#x3b2;43 is cleared from plaques after A&#x3b2; immunotherapy, similar to A&#x3b2;42 and A&#x3b2;40. Cerebrovascular A&#x3b2;43 levels did not change after immunotherapy."
"The presence of Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) and/or ATRX loss, as well as the role of other telomere abnormalities, have not been formally studied across the spectrum of NF1-associated solid tumors. Utilizing a telomere-specific FISH assay, we classified tumors as either ALT-positive or having long (without ALT), short, or normal telomere lengths. A total of 426 tumors from 256 NF1 patients were evaluated, as well as 99 MPNST tumor samples that were sporadic or of unknown NF1 status. In the NF1-glioma dataset, ALT was present in the majority of high-grade gliomas: 14 (of 23; 60%) in contrast to only 9 (of 47; 19%) low-grade gliomas (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0009). In the subset of ALT-negative glioma cases, telomere lengths were estimated and we observed 17 (57%) cases with normal, 12 (40%) cases with abnormally long, and only 1 (3%) case with short telomeres. In the NF1-associated malignant nerve sheath tumor (NF1-MPNST) set (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;75), ALT was present in 9 (12%). In the subset of ALT-negative NF1-MPNST cases, telomeres were short in 9 (38%), normal in 14 (58%) and long in 1 (3%). In the glioma set, overall survival was significantly decreased for patients with ALT-positive tumors (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). In the NF1-MPNST group, overall survival was superior for patients with tumors with short telomeres (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003). ALT occurs in a subset of NF1-associated solid tumors and is usually restricted to malignant subsets. In contrast, alterations in telomere lengths are more prevalent than ALT."
"Intraventricular meningiomas (IVMs) account for less than 5% of all intracranial meningiomas; hence their molecular phenotype remains unknown. In this study, we were interested whether genetic alterations in IVMs differ from meningiomas in other locations and analyzed our institutional series with respect to clinical and molecular characteristics. A total of 25 patients with surgical removal of an IVM at our department between 1986 and 2018 were identified from our institutional database. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 79&#x2009;months (range of 2-319&#x2009;months) and PFS at 5&#x2009;years was 86%. Corresponding tumor tissue was available for 18 patients including one matching recurrence and was subjected to targeted panel sequencing of 130 selected genes frequently mutated in brain cancers by applying a custom hybrid capture approach on a NextSeq500 instrument. Loss of chromosome 22q and 1p occurred frequently in 89 and 44% of cases. Deleterious NF2 mutations were found in 44% of IVMs (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;8/18). In non-NF2-mutated IVMs, previously reported genetic alterations including TRAF7, AKT1, SMO, KLF4, PIK3CA, and TERT were lacking, suggesting alternative genes in the pathogenesis of non-NF2 IVMs. In silico analysis revealed possible damaging mutations of APC, GABRA6, GSE1, KDR, and two SMO missense mutations differing from previously reported ones. Interestingly, all WHO&#xb0;II IVMs (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;3) harbored SMARCB1 and SMARCA4 mutations, indicating a role of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex in aggressive IVMs."
"Electron microscopy (EM) provides the necessary resolution to visualize the finer structures of nervous tissue morphology, which is important to understand healthy and pathological conditions in the brain. However, for the interpretation of the micrographs the tissue preservation is crucial. The quality of the tissue structure is mostly influenced by the post mortem interval (PMI), the time of death until the preservation of the tissue. Therefore, the aim of this study was to optimize the preparation-procedure for the human frontal lobe to preserve the ultrastructure as well as possible despite the long PMIs. Combining chemical pre- and post-fixation with cryo-fixation and cryo-substitution (""hybrid freezing""), it was possible to improve the preservation of the neuronal profiles of human brain samples compared to the ""standard"" epoxy resin embedding method. In conclusion short PMIs are generally desirable but up to a PMI of 16&#x2009;h the ultrastructure can be preserved on an acceptable level with a high contrast using the ""hybrid freezing"" protocol described here."
"To date, the development of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has largely focused on the removal of amyloid beta A&#x3b2; fragments from the CNS. Proteomic profiling of patient fluids may help identify novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers associated with AD pathology. Here, we applied the Olink&#x2122; ProSeek immunoassay to measure 270 CSF and plasma proteins across 415 A&#x3b2;- negative cognitively normal individuals (A&#x3b2;- CN), 142 A&#x3b2;-positive CN (A&#x3b2;+&#x2009;CN), 50 A&#x3b2;- mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, 75 A&#x3b2;+&#x2009;MCI patients, and 161 A&#x3b2;+&#x2009;AD patients from the Swedish BioFINDER study. A validation cohort included 59 A&#x3b2;- CN, 23 A&#x3b2;-&#x2009;+&#x2009;CN, 44 A&#x3b2;- MCI and 53 A&#x3b2;+&#x2009;MCI. To compare protein concentrations in patients versus controls, we applied multiple linear regressions adjusting for age, gender, medications, smoking and mean subject-level protein concentration, and corrected findings for false discovery rate (FDR, q&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). We identified, and replicated, altered levels of ten CSF proteins in A&#x3b2;+&#x2009;individuals, including CHIT1, SMOC2, MMP-10, LDLR, CD200, EIF4EBP1, ALCAM, RGMB, tPA and STAMBP (-&#x2009;0.14&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;d&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;1.16; q&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). We also identified and replicated alterations of six plasma proteins in A&#x3b2;+ individuals OSM, MMP-9, HAGH, CD200, AXIN1, and uPA (-&#x2009;0.77&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;d&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;1.28; q&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Multiple analytes associated with cognitive performance and cortical thickness (q&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Plasma biomarkers could distinguish AD dementia (AUC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.94, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.87-0.98) and prodromal AD (AUC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.78, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.68-0.87) from CN. These findings reemphasize the contributions of immune markers, phospholipids, angiogenic proteins and other biomarkers downstream of, and potentially orthogonal to, A&#x3b2;- and tau in AD, and identify candidate biomarkers for earlier detection of neurodegeneration."
"Multifunctional signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins play important roles in cancer. Here, we have shown that STAT6 is epigenetically silenced in some cases of malignant glioblastoma, which facilitates cancer cell survival in a hypoxic microenvironment. This downregulation results from hypermethylation of CpG islands within the STAT6 promoter by DNA methyltransferases. STAT6 interacts with Rheb under hypoxia and inhibits mTOR/S6K/S6 signaling, in turn, inducing increased HIF-1&#x3b1; translation. STAT6 silencing and consequent tumor-promoting effects are additionally observed in glioma stem-like cells (GSC). Despite recent advances in cancer treatment, survival rates have shown little improvement. This is particularly true in the case of glioma, where multimodal treatment and precision medicine is needed. Our study supports the application of epigenetic restoration of STAT6 with the aid of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, such as 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, for treatment of STAT6-silenced gliomas."
"The coordinated movement of organisms relies on efficient nerve-muscle communication at the neuromuscular junction. After peripheral nerve injury or neurodegeneration, motor neurons and Schwann cells increase the expression of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> pan-neurotrophin receptor. Even though p75<sup>NTR</sup> targeting has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to delay peripheral neuronal damage progression, the effects of long-term p75<sup>NTR</sup> inhibition at the mature neuromuscular junction have not been elucidated. We performed quantitative neuroanathomical analyses of the neuromuscular junction in p75<sup>NTR</sup> null mice by laser confocal and electron microscopy, which were complemented with electromyography, locomotor tests, and pharmacological intervention studies. Mature neuromuscular synapses of p75<sup>NTR</sup> null mice show impaired postsynaptic organization and ultrastructural complexity, which correlate with altered synaptic function at the levels of nerve activity-induced muscle responses, muscle fiber structure, force production, and locomotor performance. Our results on primary myotubes and denervated muscles indicate that muscle-derived p75<sup>NTR</sup> does not play a major role on postsynaptic organization. In turn, motor axon terminals of p75<sup>NTR</sup> null mice display a strong reduction in the number of synaptic vesicles and active zones. According to the observed pre and postsynaptic defects, pharmacological acetylcholinesterase inhibition rescued nerve-dependent muscle response and force production in p75<sup>NTR</sup> null mice. Our findings revealing that p75<sup>NTR</sup> is required to organize mature neuromuscular junctions contribute to a comprehensive view of the possible effects caused by therapeutic attempts to target p75<sup>NTR</sup>."
"Synucleinopathies [Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA)] share filamentous &#x3b1;-synuclein assemblies in nerve cells and glial cells. We compared the abilities of brain extracts from MSA and PD patients to induce neuronal &#x3b1;-synuclein assembly and neurodegeneration following intracerebral injection in heterozygous mice transgenic for human mutant A53T &#x3b1;-synuclein. MSA extracts were more potent than PD extracts in inducing &#x3b1;-synuclein assembly and in causing neurodegeneration. MSA assemblies were Campbell-Switzer- and Gallyas-silver-positive, whereas PD assemblies were only Campbell-Switzer-positive, in confirmation of previous findings. However, induced &#x3b1;-synuclein inclusions were invariably Campbell-Switzer-positive and Gallyas-negative, irrespective of whether MSA or PD brain extracts were injected. The &#x3b1;-synuclein inclusions of non-injected homozygous mice transgenic for A53T &#x3b1;-synuclein were also Campbell-Switzer-positive and Gallyas-negative. These findings demonstrate that transgene expression and its intracellular environment dominated over the silver staining properties of the conformers of assembled &#x3b1;-synuclein."
"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder, which causes dysfunction/loss of lower motor neurons and muscle weakness as well as atrophy. While SMA is primarily considered as a motor neuron disease, recent data suggests that survival motor neuron (SMN) deficiency in muscle causes intrinsic defects. We systematically profiled secreted proteins from control and SMN deficient muscle cells with two combined metabolic labeling methods and mass spectrometry. From the screening, we found lower levels of C1q/TNF-related protein 3 (CTRP3) in the SMA muscle secretome and confirmed that CTRP3 levels are indeed reduced in muscle tissues and serum of an SMA mouse model. We identified that CTRP3 regulates neuronal protein synthesis including SMN via mTOR pathway. Furthermore, CTRP3 enhances axonal outgrowth and protein synthesis rate, which are well-known impaired processes in SMA motor neurons. Our data revealed a new molecular mechanism by which muscles regulate the physiology of motor neurons via secreted molecules. Dysregulation of this mechanism contributes to the pathophysiology of SMA."
"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most frequent psychiatric illnesses, leading to reduced quality of life, ability to work and sociability, thus ranking among the major causes of disability and morbidity worldwide. To date, genetic and environmental determinants of MDD remain mostly unknown. Here, we investigated whether and how the Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) may contribute to MDD. We first examined the phenotype of PAI-1 knockout (PAI-1-/-) and wild-type (PAI-1+/+) male mice with a range of behavioral tests assessing depressive-like behaviors (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;276). We next investigated the mechanisms relating PAI-1 to MDD using molecular, biochemical and pharmacological analyzes. We demonstrate here that PAI-1 plays a key role in depression by a mechanism independent of the tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (tPA) - Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) axis, but associated with impaired metabolisms of serotonin and dopamine. Our data also reveal that PAI-1 interferes with therapeutic responses to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (escitalopram, fluoxetine). We thus highlight a new genetic preclinical model of depression, with the lack of PAI-1 as a factor of predisposition to MDD. Altogether, these original data reveal that PAI-1 should be now considered as a key player of MDD and as a potential target for the development of new drugs to cure depressive patients resistant to current treatments."
"Many mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibit impairments in hippocampal long-term-potentiation (LTP), seemingly corroborating the strong correlation between synaptic loss and cognitive decline reported in human studies. In other AD mouse models LTP is unaffected, but other defects in synaptic plasticity may still be present. We recently reported that THY-Tau22 transgenic mice, that overexpress human Tau protein carrying P301S and G272&#x2009;V mutations and show normal LTP upon high-frequency-stimulation (HFS), develop severe changes in NMDAR mediated long-term-depression (LTD), the physiological counterpart of LTP. In the present study, we focused on putative effects of AD-related pathologies on depotentiation (DP), another form of synaptic plasticity. Using a novel protocol to induce DP in the CA1-region, we found in 11-15&#x2009;months old male THY-Tau22 and APPPS1-21 transgenic mice that DP was not deteriorated by A&#xdf; pathology while significantly compromised by Tau pathology. Our findings advocate DP as a complementary form of synaptic plasticity that may help in elucidating synaptic pathomechanisms associated with different types of dementia."
"Aggregation of alpha-synuclein (&#x3b1;-SYN) is the pathological hallmark of several diseases named synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD), which is the most common neurodegenerative motor disorder. Alpha-SYN has been linked to synaptic function both in physiological and pathological conditions. However, the exact link between neuronal activity, &#x3b1;-SYN toxicity and disease progression in PD is not clear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of chronic neuromodulation in an &#x3b1;-SYN-based rat model for PD using chemogenetics. To do this, we expressed excitatory Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) combined with mutant A53T &#x3b1;-SYN, using two different recombinant adeno-associated viral&#xa0;(rAAV) vectors (serotypes 2/7 and 2/8) in rat substantia nigra&#xa0;(SN) and investigated the effect on motor behavior, synapses and neuropathology. We found that chronic neuromodulation aggravates motor deficits induced by &#x3b1;-SYN, without altering dopaminergic neurodegeneration. In addition, neuronal activation led to changes in post-translational modification and subcellular localization of &#x3b1;-SYN, linking neuronal activity to the pathophysiological role of &#x3b1;-SYN in PD."
"Although it has been suggested that the co-expression of multiple pathological proteins associated with neurodegeneration may act synergistically to induce more widespread neuropathology, experimental evidence of this is sparse. We have previously shown that the expression of Thr<sup>175</sup>Asp-tau (tau<sup>T175D</sup>) using somatic gene transfer with a stereotaxically-injected recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV9) vector induces tau pathology in rat hippocampus. In this study, we have examined whether the co-expression of human tau<sup>T175D</sup> with mutant human TDP-43 (TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup>) will act synergistically. Transgenic female Sprague-Dawley rats that inducibly express mutant human TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> using the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) tetracycline response element (TRE) driver with activity modulating tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) were utilized in these studies. Adult rats were injected with GFP-tagged tau protein constructs in a rAAV9 vector through bilateral stereotaxic injection into the hippocampus. Injected tau constructs were: wild-type GFP-tagged 2N4R human tau (tau<sup>WT</sup>; n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8), GFP-tagged tau<sup>T175D</sup> 2N4R human tau (tau<sup>T175D</sup>, pseudophosphorylated, toxic variant, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8), and GFP (control, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8). Six months post-injection, mutant TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> expression was induced for 30&#x2009;days. Behaviour testing identified motor deficits within 3&#x2009;weeks after TDP-43 expression irrespective of tau expression, though social behaviour and sensorimotor gating remained unchanged. Increased tau pathology was observed in the hippocampus of both tau<sup>WT</sup> and tau<sup>T175D</sup> expressing rats and tau<sup>T175D</sup> pathology was increased in the presence of cholinergic neuronal expression of human TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup>. These data indicate that co-expression of pathological TDP-43 and tau protein exacerbate the pathology associated with either individual protein."
"Co-occurrence of multiple neuropathologic changes is a common phenomenon, most prominently seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), complicating clinical diagnosis and patient management. Reports of co-occurring pathological processes are emerging in the group of genetically defined repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN)-translation related diseases. Here we report a case of Fragile X-associated tremor-ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) with widespread and abundant nuclear inclusions of the RAN-translation related FMRpolyG-peptide. In addition, we describe prominent neuronal and glial tau pathology representing changes seen in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). The highest abundance of the respective pathological changes was seen in distinct brain regions indicating an incidental, rather than causal correlation."
"Glioblastoma cell ability to adapt their functioning to microenvironment changes is a source of the extensive intra-tumor heterogeneity characteristic of this devastating malignant brain tumor. A systemic view of the metabolic pathways underlying glioblastoma cell functioning states is lacking. We analyzed public single cell RNA-sequencing data from glioblastoma surgical resections, which offer the closest available view of tumor cell heterogeneity as encountered at the time of patients' diagnosis. Unsupervised analyses revealed that information dispersed throughout the cell transcript repertoires encoded the identity of each tumor and masked information related to cell functioning states. Data reduction based on an experimentally-defined signature of transcription factors overcame this hurdle. It allowed cell grouping according to their tumorigenic potential, regardless of their tumor of origin. The approach relevance was validated using independent datasets of glioblastoma cell and tissue transcriptomes, patient-derived cell lines and orthotopic xenografts. Overexpression of genes coding for amino acid and lipid metabolism enzymes involved in anti-oxidative, energetic and cell membrane processes characterized cells with high tumorigenic potential. Modeling of their expression network highlighted the very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis pathway at the core of the network. Expression of its most downstream enzymatic component, ELOVL2, was associated with worsened patient survival, and required for cell tumorigenic properties in vivo. Our results demonstrate the power of signature-driven analyses of single cell transcriptomes to obtain an integrated view of metabolic pathways at play within the heterogeneous cell landscape of patient tumors."
"Tau is a microtubule-binding protein that can receive various post-translational modifications (PTMs) including phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation, glycosylation, nitration, sumoylation and truncation. Hyperphosphorylation of tau is linked to its aggregation and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While more than 70 phosphorylation sites have been detected previously on NFT tau, studies of oligomeric and detergent-soluble tau in human brains during the early stages of AD are lacking. Here we apply a comprehensive electrochemiluminescence ELISA assay to analyze twenty-five different PTM sites as well as tau oligomerization in control and sporadic AD brain. The samples were classified as Braak stages 0-I, II or III-IV, corresponding to the progression of microscopically detectable tau pathology throughout different brain regions. We found that soluble tau multimers are strongly increased at Braak stages III-IV in all brain regions under investigation, including the temporal cortex, which does not contain NFTs or misfolded oligomers at this stage of pathology. We additionally identified five phosphorylation sites that are specifically and consistently increased across the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and temporal cortex in the same donors. Three of these sites correlate with tau multimerization in all three brain regions, but do not overlap with the epitopes of phospho-sensitive antibodies commonly used for the immunohistochemical detection of NFTs. Our results thus suggest that soluble multimers are characterized by a small set of specific phosphorylation events that differ from those dominating in mature NFTs. These findings shed light on early PTM changes of tau during AD pathogenesis in human brains."

"Many biology-based precision drugs are available that neutralize aberrant molecular pathways in cancer. Molecular heterogeneity and the lack of reliable companion diagnostic biomarkers for many drugs makes targeted treatment of cancer inaccurate for many individuals. Identifying actionable hyperactive biological pathways in individual cancers may improve this situation.To achieve this we applied a novel targeted RNA next generation sequencing (t/RNA-NGS) technique to surgically obtained glioma tissues. The test combines mutation detection with analysis of biological pathway activities that are involved in tumour behavior in many cancer types (e.g. tyrosine kinase signaling, angiogenesis signaling, immune response, metabolism), via quantitative measurement of transcript levels and splice variants of hundreds of genes. We here present proof of concept that the technique, which uses molecular inversion probes, generates a histology-independent molecular diagnosis and identifies classifiers that are strongly associated with conventional histopathology diagnoses and even with patient prognosis. The test not only confirmed known glioma-associated molecular aberrations but also identified aberrant expression levels of actionable genes and mutations that have so far been considered not to be associated with glioma, opening up the possibility of drug repurposing for individual patients. Its cost-effectiveness makes t/RNA-NGS to an attractive instrument to aid oncologists in therapy decision making."
"For the proper organization of the six-layered mammalian neocortex it is required that neurons migrate radially from their place of birth towards their designated destination. The molecular machinery underlying this neuronal migration is still poorly understood. The dynein-adaptor protein BICD2 is associated with a spectrum of human neurological diseases, including malformations of cortical development. Previous studies have shown that knockdown of BICD2 interferes with interkinetic nuclear migration in radial glial progenitor cells, and that Bicd2-deficient mice display an altered laminar organization of the cerebellum and the neocortex. However, the precise in vivo role of BICD2 in neocortical development remains unclear. By comparing cell-type specific conditional Bicd2 knock-out mice, we found that radial migration in the cortex predominantly depends on BICD2 function in post-mitotic neurons. Neuron-specific Bicd2 cKO mice showed severely impaired radial migration of late-born upper-layer neurons. BICD2 depletion in cortical neurons interfered with proper Golgi organization, and neuronal maturation and survival of cortical plate neurons. Single-neuron labeling revealed a specific role of BICD2 in bipolar locomotion. Rescue experiments with wildtype and disease-related mutant BICD2 constructs revealed that a point-mutation in the RAB6/RANBP2-binding-domain, associated with cortical malformation in patients, fails to restore proper cortical neuron migration. Together, these findings demonstrate a novel, cell-intrinsic role of BICD2 in cortical neuron migration in vivo and provide new insights into BICD2-dependent dynein-mediated functions during cortical development."
"Microglial function is highly dependent on cell motility, with baseline motility required for homeostatic surveillance activity and directed motility to migrate towards a source of injury. Experimental evidence suggests impaired microglial motility in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and therefore we have investigated whether the expression of proteins associated with motility is altered in AD and affected by the A&#x3b2; immunotherapy using post-mortem brain tissue of 32 controls, 44&#x2009;AD cases, and 16&#x2009;AD cases from our unique group of patients immunised against A&#x3b2;42 (iAD).Sections of brain were immunolabelled and quantified for (i) the motility-related microglial proteins Iba1, cofilin 1 (CFL1), coronin-1a (CORO1A) and P2RY12, and (ii) pan-A&#x3b2;, A&#x3b2;42 and phosphorylated tau (ptau). The neuroinflammatory environment was characterised using Meso Scale Discovery multiplex assays. The expression of all four motility-related proteins was unmodified in AD compared with controls, whereas Iba1 and P2RY12, the homeostatic markers, were increased in the iAD group compared with AD. Iba1 and P2RY12 showed significant positive correlations with A&#x3b2; in controls but not in the AD or iAD groups. Pro- and anti-inflammatory proteins were increased in AD, whereas immunotherapy appears to result in a slightly less pro-inflammatory environment.Our findings suggest that as A&#x3b2; appears during the ageing process, the homeostatic Iba1 and P2RY12 -positive microglia respond to A&#x3b2;, but this response is absent in AD. A&#x3b2;-immunisation promoted increased Iba1 and P2RY12 expression, likely reflecting increased baseline microglial motility but without restoring the profile observed in controls."
"Adolescent binge drinking represents a major public health challenge and can lead to persistent neurological and mental conditions, but the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using a mouse model of adolescent binge ethanol treatment (ABET), we found that this treatment induced behavioral changes associated with demyelination in different brain regions. After ABET, adolescent mice exhibited anxiogenic behaviors with no change in locomotion on the elevated plus maze, and impaired spatial memory indicated by a significant reduction in spontaneous alternation in the Y maze test. Both effects persisted into adulthood. Anatomical studies further showed that ABET induced a significant reduction of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) GABAergic interneurons and myelin density in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). While these deficits in PV+ interneurons and myelin persisted into early adulthood in the hippocampus, the myelin density recovered in the mPFC. Moreover, whereas ABET mainly damaged myelin of PV+ axons in the hippocampus, it primarily damaged myelin of PV-negative axons in the mPFC. Thus, our findings reveal that an adolescent binge alcohol treatment regimen disrupts spatial working memory, increases anxiety-like behaviors, and exerts unique temporal and spatial patterns of gray matter demyelination in the hippocampus and mPFC."
"The detection of amyloid beta deposits and neurofibrillary tangles, both hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is key to understanding the mechanisms underlying these pathologies. Luminescent conjugated oligothiophenes (LCOs) enable fluorescence imaging of these protein aggregates. Using LCOs and multiphoton microscopy, individual tangles and amyloid beta deposits were labeled in vivo and imaged longitudinally in a mouse model of tauopathy and cerebral amyloidosis, respectively. Importantly, LCO HS-84, whose emission falls in the green region of the spectrum, allowed for the first time longitudinal imaging of tangle dynamics following a single intravenous injection. In addition, LCO HS-169, whose emission falls in the red region of the spectrum, successfully labeled amyloid beta deposits, allowing multiplexing with other reporters whose emission falls in the green region of the spectrum. In conclusion, this method can provide a new approach for longitudinal in vivo imaging using multiphoton microscopy of AD pathologies as well as other neurodegenerative diseases associated with protein aggregation in mouse models."
"All cancer cells need to maintain functional telomeres to sustain continuous cell division and proliferation. In human diffuse gliomas, functional telomeres are maintained due either to reactivation of telomerase expression, the main pathway in most cancer types, or to activation of a mechanism called the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). The presence of IDH1/2 mutations (IDH-mutant) together with loss of ATRX expression (ATRX-lost) are frequently associated with ALT in diffuse gliomas. However, detection of ALT, and a fortiori its quantification, are rarely, if ever, measured in neuropathology laboratories. We measured the level of ALT activity using the previously described quantitative ""C-circle"" assay and analyzed it in a well characterized cohort of 104 IDH-mutant and ATRX-lost adult diffuse gliomas. We report that in IDH-mutant ATRX-lost anaplastic astrocytomas, the intensity of ALT was inversely correlated with age (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), the younger the patient, the higher the intensity of ALT. Strikingly, glioblastomas having progressed from anaplastic astrocytomas did not exhibit this correlation. ALT activity level in the tumor did not depend on telomere length in healthy tissue cells from the same patient. In summary, we have uncovered the existence, in anaplastic astrocytomas but not in glioblastomas with the same IDH and ATRX mutations, of a correlation between patient age and the level of activity of ALT, a telomerase-independent pathway of telomere maintenance."

"Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD). While the clinical presentation of LRRK2 mutation carriers is similar to that of idiopathic PD (iPD) patients, the neuropathology of LRRK2 PD is less clearly defined. Lewy bodies (LBs) composed of &#x3b1;-synuclein are a major feature of iPD, but are not present in all LRRK2 PD cases. There is some evidence that tau may act as a neuropathological substrate in LB-negative LRRK2 PD, but this has not been examined systematically. In the current study, we examined &#x3b1;-synuclein, tau, and amyloid &#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) pathologies in 12 LRRK2 mutation carriers. We find that &#x3b1;-synuclein pathology is present in 63.6% of LRRK2 mutation carriers, but tau pathology can be found in 100% of carriers and is abundant in 91% of carriers. We further use an antibody which selectively binds Alzheimer's disease (AD)-type tau and use quantitative analysis of tau pathology to demonstrate that AD tau is the prominent type of tau present in LRRK2 mutation carriers. Abundant A&#x3b2; pathology can also be found in LRRK2 mutation carriers and is consistent with comorbid AD pathology. Finally, we assessed the association of neuropathology with clinical features in LRRK2 mutation carriers and idiopathic individuals and find that LRRK2 PD shares clinical and pathological features of idiopathic PD. The prevalence of AD-type tau pathology in LRRK2 PD is an important consideration for understanding PD pathogenesis and refining clinical trial inclusion and progression criterion."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related amyloid &#x3b2;-peptide (A&#x3b2;) pathology in the form of amyloid plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) spreads in its topographical distribution, increases in quantity, and undergoes qualitative changes in its composition of modified A&#x3b2; species throughout the pathogenesis of AD. It is not clear which of these aspects of A&#x3b2; pathology contribute to AD progression and to what extent amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) reflects each of these aspects. To address these questions three cohorts of human autopsy cases (in total n&#x2009;=&#x2009;271) were neuropathologically and biochemically examined for the topographical distribution of A&#x3b2; pathology (plaques and CAA), its quantity and its composition. These parameters were compared with neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) and neuritic plaque pathology, the degree of dementia and the results from [<sup>18</sup>F]flutemetamol amyloid PET imaging in cohort 3. All three aspects of A&#x3b2; pathology correlated with one another, the estimation of A&#x3b2; pathology by [<sup>18</sup>F]flutemetamol PET, AD-related NFT pathology, neuritic plaques, and with the degree of dementia. These results show that one aspect of A&#x3b2; pathology can be used to predict the other two, and correlates well with the development of dementia, advancing NFT and neuritic plaque pathology. Moreover, amyloid PET estimates all three aspects of A&#x3b2; pathology in-vivo. Accordingly, amyloid PET-based estimates for staging of amyloid pathology indicate the progression status of amyloid pathology in general and, in doing so, also of AD pathology. Only 7.75% of our cases deviated from this general association."
"Numerous clinical studies have established the debilitating neurocognitive side effects of chemotherapy in the treatment of breast cancer, often referred as chemobrain. We hypothesize that cognitive impairments are associated with elevated microglial inflammation in the brain. Thus, either elimination of microglia or restoration of microglial function could ameliorate cognitive dysfunction. Using a rodent model of chronic Adriamycin (ADR) treatment, a commonly used breast cancer chemotherapy, we evaluated two strategies to ameliorate chemobrain: 1) microglia depletion using the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor PLX5622 and 2) human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (iMG)-derived extracellular vesicle (EV) treatment. In strategy 1 mice received ADR once weekly for 4&#x2009;weeks and were then administered CSF1R inhibitor (PLX5622) starting 72&#x2009;h post-ADR treatment. ADR-treated animals given a normal diet exhibited significant behavioral deficits and increased microglial activation 4-6&#x2009;weeks later. PLX5622-treated mice exhibited no ADR-related cognitive deficits and near complete depletion of IBA-1 and CD68<sup>+</sup> microglia in the brain. Cytokine and RNA sequencing analysis for inflammation pathways validated these findings. In strategy 2, 1 week after the last ADR treatment, mice received retro-orbital vein injections of iMG-EV (once weekly for 4&#x2009;weeks) and 1 week later, mice underwent behavior testing. ADR-treated mice receiving EV showed nearly complete restoration of cognitive function and significant reductions in microglial activation as compared to untreated ADR mice. Our data demonstrate that ADR treatment elevates CNS inflammation that is linked to cognitive dysfunction and that attenuation of neuroinflammation reverses the adverse neurocognitive effects of chemotherapy."
"Synucleinopathies [Parkinson's disease with or without dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy] are neurodegenerative diseases that are defined by the presence of filamentous &#x3b1;-synuclein inclusions. We investigated the ability of luminescent conjugated oligothiophenes to stain the inclusions of Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. They stained the Lewy pathology of Parkinson's disease and the glial cytoplasmic inclusions of multiple system atrophy. Spectral analysis of HS-68-stained inclusions showed a red shift in multiple system atrophy, but the difference with Parkinson's disease was not significant. However, when inclusions were double-labelled for HS-68 and an antibody specific for &#x3b1;-synuclein phosphorylated at S129, they could be distinguished based on colour shifts with blue designated for Parkinson's disease and red for multiple system atrophy. The inclusions of Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy could also be distinguished using fluorescence lifetime imaging. These findings are consistent with the presence of distinct conformers of assembled &#x3b1;-synuclein in Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy."
"The contribution of mosaic alterations to tumors of the nervous system and to non-malignant neurological diseases has been unmasked thanks to the development of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies. We report here the case of a young patient without any remarkable familial medical history who was first referred at 7&#x2009;years of age, for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) of Asperger type, not associated with macrocephaly. The patient subsequently presented at 10&#x2009;years of age with multiple nodular lesions located within the trigeminal, facial and acoustic nerve ganglia and at the L3 level. Histological examination of this latter lesion revealed a glioneuronal hamartoma, exhibiting heterogeneous PTEN immunoreactivity, astrocyte and endothelial cell nuclei expressing PTEN, but not ganglion cells. NGS performed on the hamartoma allowed the detection of a PTEN pathogenic variant in 30% of the reads. The presence of this variant in the DNA extracted from blood and buccal swabs in 3.5 and 11% of the NGS reads, respectively, confirmed the mosaic state of the PTEN variant. The anatomical distribution of the lesions suggests that the mutational event affecting PTEN occurred in neural crest progenitors, thus explaining the absence of macrocephaly. This report shows that mosaic alteration of PTEN may result in multiple central and peripheral nervous system hamartomas and that the presence of such alteration should be considered in patients with multiple nervous system masses, even in the absence of cardinal features of PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, especially macrocephaly."
"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized pathologically by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (A&#x3b2;) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Recently, primary age-related tauopathy (PART) has been described as a new anatomopathological disorder where NFTs are the main feature in the absence of neuritic plaques. However, since PART has mainly been studied in post-mortem patient brains, not much is known about the clinical or neuroimaging characteristics of PART. Here, we studied the clinical brain imaging characteristics of PART focusing on neuroanatomical vulnerability by applying a previously validated multiregion visual atrophy scale. We analysed 26 cases with confirmed PART with paired clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions. In this selected cohort we found that upon correcting for the effect of age, there is increased atrophy in the medial temporal region with increasing Braak staging (r&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.3937, p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.0466). Upon controlling for Braak staging effect, predominantly two regions, anterior temporal (r&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.3638, p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.0677) and medial temporal (r&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.3836, p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.053), show a trend for increased atrophy with increasing age. Moreover, anterior temporal lobe atrophy was associated with decreased semantic memory/language (r&#xa0;=&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.5823, p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.0056; and r&#xa0;=&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.6371, p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.0019, respectively), as was medial temporal lobe atrophy (r&#xa0;=&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.4445, p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.0435). Overall, these findings support that PART is associated with medial temporal lobe atrophy and predominantly affects semantic memory/language. These findings highlight that other factors associated with aging and beyond NFTs could be involved in PART pathophysiology."
"Swedish type Hereditary Diffuse Leukoencephalopathy with Spheroids (HDLS-S) is a severe adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with the histopathological hallmark of neuraxonal degeneration with spheroids, described in a large family with a dominant inheritance pattern. The initial stage of the disease is dominated by frontal lobe symptoms that develop into a rapidly advancing encephalopathy with pyramidal, deep sensory, extrapyramidal and optic tract symptoms. Median survival is less than 10&#x2009;years. Recently, pathogenic mutations in CSF1R were reported in a clinically and histologically similar leukoencephalopathy segregating in several families. Still, the cause of HDLS-S remained elusive since its initial description in 1984, with no CSF1R mutations identified in the family. Here we update the original findings associated with HDLS-S after a systematic and recent assessment of several family members. We also report the results from exome sequencing analyses indicating the p.Cys152Phe variant in the alanyl tRNA synthetase (AARS) gene as the probable cause of this disease. The variant affects an amino acid located in the aminoacylation domain of the protein and does not cause differences in splicing or expression in the brain. Brain pathology in one case after 10&#x2009;years of disease duration showed the end stage of the disease to be characterized by widespread liquefaction of the white matter leaving only some macrophages and glial cells behind the centrifugally progressing front. These results point to AARS as a candidate gene for rapidly progressing adult-onset CSF1R-negative leukoencephalopathies."
"Motor-, behavior- and/or cognition-related symptoms are key hallmarks in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP), respectively. It has been reported that these patients also experience sleep disturbances, which might implicate a disturbed circadian rhythm of the sleep/wake cycle. It remains unknown, however, whether cells involved in the circadian sleep/wake cycle are affected by ALS- and FTLD-related neuropathological changes including phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) aggregates and dipeptide repeat protein (DPR) inclusions resulting from the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion. Immunohistochemistry for DPR and pTDP-43 pathology was performed in post-mortem hypothalamus and pineal gland tissue of patients with ALS and/or FTLD-TDP with and without the C9orf72 repeat expansion and healthy controls. Circadian sleep/wake-associated cells, including pinealocytes and hypothalamic neurons related to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), were microscopically assessed. We observed numerous DPR inclusions (poly(GA), poly(GP), poly(GR) and poly(PR)) in the pinealocytes and few poly(GA) inclusions in the SCN-related neurons in C9orf72-related ALS and/or FTLD-TDP cases. These circadian sleep/wake-associated cells, however, were devoid of pTDP-43 pathology both in C9orf72- and nonC9orf72-related ALS and/or FTLD-TDP cases. Our neuropathological findings show that pinealocytes and, to a lesser extent, SCN-related neurons are affected by DPR pathology. This may reflect an involvement of these cells in sleep/wake disturbances observed in ALS and/or FTLD-TDP patients."
"Degeneration of synapses in Alzheimer's disease (AD) strongly correlates with cognitive decline, and synaptic pathology contributes to disease pathophysiology. We recently observed that the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD, apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (APOE4), is associated with exacerbated synapse loss and synaptic accumulation of oligomeric amyloid beta in human AD brain. To begin to understand the molecular cascades involved in synapse loss in AD and how this is mediated by APOE, and to generate a resource of knowledge of changes in the synaptic proteome in AD, we conducted a proteomic screen and systematic in silico analysis of synaptoneurosome preparations from temporal and occipital cortices of human AD and control subjects with known APOE gene status. We examined brain tissue from 33 subjects (7-10 per group). We pooled tissue from all subjects in each group for unbiased proteomic analyses followed by validation with individual case samples. Our analysis identified over 5500 proteins in human synaptoneurosomes and highlighted disease, brain region, and APOE-associated changes in multiple molecular pathways including a decreased abundance in AD of proteins important for synaptic and mitochondrial function and an increased abundance of proteins involved in neuroimmune interactions and intracellular signaling."
"The presence of genome-wide DNA hypermethylation is a hallmark of lower grade gliomas (LGG) with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations. Further molecular classification of IDH mutant gliomas is defined by the presence (IDHmut-codel) or absence (IDHmut-noncodel) of hemizygous codeletion of chromosome arms 1p and 19q. Despite the DNA hypermethylation seen in bulk tumors, intra-tumoral heterogeneity at the epigenetic level has not been thoroughly analyzed. To address this question, we performed the first epigenetic profiling of single cells in a cohort of 5 gliomas with IDH1 mutation using single nucleus Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (snATAC-seq). Using the Fluidigm HT IFC microfluidics platform, we generated chromatin accessibility maps from 336 individual nuclei, and identified variable promoter accessibility of non-coding RNAs in LGGs. Interestingly, local chromatin structures of several non-coding RNAs are significant factors that contribute to heterogeneity, and show increased promoter accessibility in IDHmut-noncodel samples. As an example for clinical significance of this result, we identify CYTOR as a poor prognosis factor in gliomas with IDH mutation. Open chromatin assay points to differential accessibility of non-coding RNAs as an important source of epigenetic heterogeneity within individual tumors and between molecular subgroups. Rare populations of nuclei that resemble either IDH mutant molecular group co-exist within IDHmut-noncodel and IDHmut-codel groups, and along with non-coding RNAs may be an important issue to consider for future studies, as they may help guide predict treatment response and relapse.A web-based explorer for the data is available at shiny.turcanlab.org."
"Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the Methyl CpG binding protein&#xa0;2 (MECP2) gene. Deficient K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup>co-transporter 2 (KCC2) expression is suggested to play a key role in the neurodevelopmental delay in RTT patients' neuronal networks. KCC2 is a major player in neuronal maturation by supporting the GABAergic switch, through the regulation of neuronal chlorine homeostasis. Previous studies suggest that MeCP2 mutations lead to changed KCC2 expression levels, thereby causing a disturbance in excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance. To investigate this, we performed protein and RNA expression analysis on post mortem brain tissue from RTT patients and healthy controls. We showed that KCC2 expression, in particular the KCC2a isoform, is relatively decreased in RTT patients. The expression of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporter 1 (NKCC1), responsible for the inward transport of chlorine, is not affected, leading to a reduced KCC2/NKCC1 ratio in RTT brains. Our report confirms KCC2 expression alterations in RTT patients in human brain tissue, which is in line with other studies, suggesting affected E/I balance could underlie neurodevelopmental defects in RTT patients."
"Protein aggregation is a pathological feature of neurodegenerative disorders. We previously demonstrated that protein inclusions in the brain are composed of supersaturated proteins, which are abundant and aggregation-prone, and form a metastable subproteome. It is not yet clear, however, whether this phenomenon is also associated with non-neuronal protein conformational disorders. To respond to this question, we analyzed proteomic datasets from biopsies of patients with genetic and acquired protein aggregate myopathy (PAM) by quantifying the changes in composition, concentration and aggregation propensity of proteins in the fibers containing inclusions and those surrounding them. We found that a metastable subproteome is present in skeletal muscle from healthy patients. The expression of this subproteome escalate as proteomic samples are taken more proximal to the pathologic inclusion, eventually exceeding its solubility limits and aggregating. While most supersaturated proteins decrease or maintain steady abundance across healthy fibers and inclusion-containing fibers, proteins within the metastable subproteome rise in abundance, suggesting that they escape regulation. Taken together, our results show in the context of a human conformational disorder that the supersaturation of a metastable subproteome underlies widespread aggregation and correlates with the histopathological state of the tissue."
"Activated Caspase-6 (Casp6) is associated with age-dependent cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease (AD). Mice expressing human Caspase-6 in hippocampal CA1 neurons develop age-dependent cognitive deficits, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. This study assessed if methylene blue (MB), a phenothiazine that inhibits caspases, alters Caspase-6-induced neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in mice. Aged cognitively impaired Casp6-overexpressing mice were treated with methylene blue in drinking water for 1 month. Methylene blue&#xa0;treatment did not alter Caspase-6 levels, assessed by RT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry, but inhibited fluorescently-labelled Caspase-6 activity in acute brain slice intact neurons. Methylene blue&#xa0;treatment rescued Caspase-6-induced episodic and spatial memory deficits measured by novel object recognition and Barnes maze, respectively. Methylene blue improved synaptic function of hippocampal CA1 neurons since theta-burst long-term potentiation (LTP), measured by field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in acute brain slices, was successfully induced in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pathway in methylene blue-treated, but not in vehicle-treated, Caspase-6 mice. Increased neuroinflammation, measured by ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1)-positive microglia numbers and subtypes, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes, were decreased by&#xa0;methylene blue treatment. Therefore, methylene blue reverses Caspase-6-induced cognitive deficits by inhibiting Caspase-6, and Caspase-6-mediated neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Our results indicate that Caspase-6-mediated damage is reversible months after the onset of cognitive deficits and suggest that&#xa0;methylene blue could benefit Alzheimer disease patients by reversing Caspase-6-mediated cognitive decline."
"Damage to axonal transport is an early pathogenic event in Alzheimer's disease. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a key axonal transport cargo since disruption to APP transport promotes amyloidogenic processing of APP. Moreover, altered APP processing itself disrupts axonal transport. The mechanisms that regulate axonal transport of APP are therefore directly relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. APP is transported anterogradely through axons on kinesin-1 motors and one route for this transport involves calsyntenin-1, a type-1 membrane spanning protein that acts as a direct ligand for kinesin-1 light chains (KLCs). Thus, loss of calsyntenin-1 disrupts APP axonal transport and promotes amyloidogenic processing of APP. Phosphorylation of KLC1 on serine-460 has been shown to reduce anterograde axonal transport of calsyntenin-1 by inhibiting the KLC1-calsyntenin-1 interaction. Here we demonstrate that in Alzheimer's disease frontal cortex, KLC1 levels are reduced and the relative levels of KLC1 serine-460 phosphorylation are increased; these changes occur relatively early in the disease process. We also show that a KLC1 serine-460 phosphomimetic mutant inhibits axonal transport of APP in both mammalian neurons in culture and in Drosophila neurons in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that expression of the KLC1 serine-460 phosphomimetic mutant promotes amyloidogenic processing of APP. Together, these results suggest that increased KLC1 serine-460 phosphorylation contributes to Alzheimer's disease."
"Hexanucleotide repeat expansions of variable size in C9orf72 are the most prevalent genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Sense and antisense transcripts of the expansions are translated by repeat-associated non-AUG translation into five dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). Of these, the polyGR, polyPR and, to a lesser extent, polyGA DPRs are neurotoxic, with polyGA the most abundantly detected DPR in patient tissue. Trans-cellular transmission of protein aggregates has recently emerged as a major driver of toxicity in various neurodegenerative diseases. In vitro evidence suggests that the C9 DPRs can spread. However, whether this phenomenon occurs under more complex in vivo conditions remains unexplored. Here, we used the adult fly brain to investigate whether the C9 DPRs can spread in vivo upon expression in a subset of neurons. We found that only polyGA can progressively spread throughout the brain, which accumulates in the shape of aggregate-like puncta inside recipient cells. Interestingly, GA transmission occurred as early as 3&#x2009;days after expression induction. By comparing the spread of 36, 100 and 200 polyGA repeats, we found that polyGA spread is enhanced upon expression of longer GA DPRs. Transmission of polyGA is greater in older flies, indicating that age-associated factors exacerbate the spread. These data highlight a unique propensity of polyGA to spread throughout the brain, which could contribute to the greater abundance of polyGA in patient tissue. In addition, we present a model of early GA transmission that is suitable for genetic screens to identify mechanisms of spread and its consequences in vivo."
"Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling contributes to failure of remyelination in multiple sclerosis, but targeting this therapeutically is complicated by its functional pleiotropy. We now identify FGF2 as a factor up-regulated by astrocytes in active inflammatory lesions that disrupts myelination via FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2) mediated activation of Wingless (Wnt) signaling; pharmacological inhibition of Wnt being sufficient to abrogate inhibition of myelination by FGF2 in tissue culture. Using a novel FGFR1-selective agonist (F2&#x2009;V2) generated by deleting the N-terminal 26 amino acids of FGF2 we demonstrate polarizing signal transduction to favor FGFR1 abrogates FGF mediated inhibition of myelination but retains its ability to induce expression of pro-myelinating and immunomodulatory factors that include Cd93, Lif, Il11, Hbegf, Cxcl1 and Timp1. Our data provide new insights into the mechanistic basis of remyelination failure in MS and identify selective activation of FGFR1 as a novel strategy to induce a neuroprotective signaling environment in multiple sclerosis and other neurological diseases."
"Here we describe the use of an organotypic hippocampal slice model for studying &#x3b1;-synuclein aggregation and inter-neuronal spreading initiated by microinjection of pre-formed &#x3b1;-synuclein fibrils (PFFs). PFF injection at dentate gyrus (DG) templates the formation of endogenous &#x3b1;-synuclein aggregates in axons and cell bodies of this region that spread to CA3 and CA1 regions. Aggregates are insoluble and phosphorylated at serine-129, recapitulating Lewy pathology features found in Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. The model was found to favor anterograde spreading of the aggregates. Furthermore, it allowed development of slices expressing only serine-129 phosphorylation-deficient human &#x3b1;-synuclein (S129G) using an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector in &#x3b1;-synuclein knockout slices. The processes of aggregation and spreading of &#x3b1;-synuclein were thereby shown to be independent of phosphorylation at serine-129. We provide methods and highlight crucial steps for PFF microinjection and characterization of aggregate formation and spreading. Slices derived from genetically engineered mice or manipulated using viral vectors allow testing of hypotheses on mechanisms involved in the formation of &#x3b1;-synuclein aggregates and their prion-like spreading."
"Perioperative sleep disturbance is a risk factor for persistent pain after surgery. Clinical studies have shown that patients with insufficient sleep before and after surgery experience more intense and long-lasting postoperative pain. We hypothesize that sleep deprivation alters L-type calcium channels in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), thus delaying the recovery from post-surgical pain. To verify this hypothesis, and to identify new predictors and therapeutic targets for persistent postoperative pain, we first established a model of postsurgical pain with perioperative sleep deprivation (SD) by administering hind paw plantar incision to sleep deprivation rats. Then we conducted behavioral tests, including tests with von Frey filaments and a laser heat test, to verify sensory pain, measured the expression of L-type calcium channels using western blotting and immunofluorescence of dorsal root ganglia (an important neural target for peripheral nociception), and examined the activity of L-type calcium channels and neuron excitability using electrophysiological measurements. We validated the findings by performing intraperitoneal injections of calcium channel blockers and microinjections of dorsal root ganglion cells with adeno-associated virus. We found that short-term sleep deprivation before and after surgery increased expression and activity of L-type calcium channels in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia, and delayed recovery from postsurgical pain. Blocking these channels reduced impact of sleep deprivation. We conclude that the increased expression and activity of L-type calcium channels is associated with the sleep deprivation-mediated prolongation of postoperative pain. L-type calcium channels are thus a potential target for management of postoperative pain."
"Congenital myopathies (CM) form a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by perinatal muscle weakness. Here, we report an 11-year old male offspring of consanguineous parents of Lebanese origin. He presented with proximal weakness including Gower's sign, and skeletal muscle biopsy revealed myopathic changes with core-like structures. Whole exome sequencing of this index patient lead to the discovery of a novel genetically defined CM subtype based on bi-allelic mutations in the uncoordinated mutant number-45 myosin chaperone B (UNC45B) NM_173167:c.2261G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A, p.Arg754Gln. The mutation is conserved in evolution and co-segregates within the pedigree with the phenotype, and located in the myosin binding armadillo repeat domain 3 (ARM3), and has a CADD Score of 35. On a multimeric level, UNC45B aggregates to a chain which serves as an assembly line and functions as a ""template"" defining the geometry, regularity, and periodicity of myosin arranged into muscle thick filaments.&#xa0;Our discovery is in line with the previously described myopathological phenotypes in C. elegans and in vertebrate mutants and knockdown-models. In conclusion, we here report for the first time a patient with an UNC45B mutation causing a novel genetically defined congenital myopathy disease entity."
"Loss-of-function mutations in progranulin (GRN) are a major autosomal dominant cause of frontotemporal dementia. Most pathogenic GRN mutations result in progranulin haploinsufficiency, which is thought to cause frontotemporal dementia in GRN mutation carriers. Progranulin haploinsufficiency may drive frontotemporal dementia pathogenesis by disrupting lysosomal function, as patients with GRN mutations on both alleles develop the lysosomal storage disorder neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, and frontotemporal dementia patients with GRN mutations (FTD-GRN) also accumulate lipofuscin. The specific lysosomal deficits caused by progranulin insufficiency remain unclear, but emerging data indicate that progranulin insufficiency may impair lysosomal sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes. We investigated the effects of progranulin insufficiency on sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes in the inferior frontal gyrus of FTD-GRN patients using fluorogenic activity assays, biochemical profiling of enzyme levels and posttranslational modifications, and quantitative neuropathology. Of the enzymes studied, only &#x3b2;-glucocerebrosidase exhibited impairment in FTD-GRN patients. Brains from FTD-GRN patients had lower activity than controls, which was associated with lower levels of mature &#x3b2;-glucocerebrosidase protein and accumulation of insoluble, incompletely glycosylated &#x3b2;-glucocerebrosidase. Immunostaining revealed loss of neuronal &#x3b2;-glucocerebrosidase in FTD-GRN patients. To investigate the effects of progranulin insufficiency on &#x3b2;-glucocerebrosidase outside of the context of neurodegeneration, we investigated &#x3b2;-glucocerebrosidase activity in progranulin-insufficient mice. Brains from Grn<sup>-/-</sup> mice had lower &#x3b2;-glucocerebrosidase activity than wild-type littermates, which was corrected by AAV-progranulin gene therapy. These data show that progranulin insufficiency impairs &#x3b2;-glucocerebrosidase activity in the brain. This effect is strongest in neurons and may be caused by impaired &#x3b2;-glucocerebrosidase processing."

"There is great interest in understanding how the central nervous system (CNS) communicates with the immune system for recruitment of protective responses. Infiltrating phagocytic monocytes and granulocytes are implicated in neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). To investigate how CNS endogenous signals can be harnessed to promote anti-inflammatory programs, we have used a particulate Toll-like receptor 9 and nucleotide-oligomerization domain 2 bispecific innate ligand (MIS416), to address whether its phagocytosis within the CNS recruits protective myeloid cells. We find that MIS416 injected intrathecally into the cerebrospinal fluid via the cisterna magna induced a local chemokine response that recruited blood-derived monocytes and neutrophils to the CNS. These cells phagocytosed MIS416. The increase in EAE severity normally seen from time of onset did not occur in mice receiving MIS416. This suppression of disease symptoms was dependent on expression of the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR). Transfer of intrathecal MIS416-induced neutrophils suppressed EAE in recipient mice, while monocytes did not transfer protection. MIS416-induced neutrophils showed increased IL-10 expression that was IFNAR1-driven. In contrast to intrathecal administration, intravenous administration of MIS416 led to monocyte but not neutrophil infiltration to the CNS. We thus identify a CNS-intrinsic and -specific phagocytosis-induced recruitment of anti-inflammatory neutrophils that contribute to CNS homeostasis and may have therapeutic potential."
"The discovery of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene family alterations as drivers of primary brain tumors has generated significant excitement, both as potential therapeutic targets as well as defining hallmarks of histologic entities. However, FGFR alterations among neuroepithelial lesions are not restricted to high or low grade, nor to adult vs. pediatric-type tumors. While it may be tempting to consider FGFR-altered tumors as a unified group, this underlying heterogeneity poses diagnostic and interpretive challenges. Therefore, understanding the underlying biology of tumors harboring specific FGFR alterations is critical. In this review, recent evidence for recurrent FGFR alterations in histologically and biologically low-grade neuroepithelial tumors (LGNTs) is examined (namely FGFR1 tyrosine kinase domain duplication in low grade glioma, FGFR1-TACC1 fusions in extraventricular neurocytoma [EVN], and FGFR2-CTNNA3 fusions in polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumor of the young [PLNTY]). Additionally, FGFR alterations with less well-defined prognostic implications are considered (FGFR3-TACC3 fusions, FGFR1 hotspot mutations). Finally, a framework for practical interpretation of FGFR alterations in low grade glial/glioneuronal tumors is proposed."

"Low grade gliomas are the most frequent brain tumors in children and encompass a spectrum of histologic entities which are currently assigned World Health Organisation grades I and II. They differ substantially from their adult counterparts in both their underlying genetic alterations and in the infrequency with which they transform to higher grade tumors. Nonetheless, children with low grade glioma are a therapeutic challenge due to the heterogeneity in their clinical behavior - in particular, those with incomplete surgical resection often suffer repeat progressions with resultant morbidity and, in some cases, mortality. The identification of up-regulation of the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (RAS/MAPK) pathway as a near universal feature of these tumors has led to the development of targeted therapeutics aimed at improving responses while mitigating patient morbidity. Here, we review how molecular information can help to further define the entities which fall under the umbrella of pediatric-type low-grade glioma. In doing so we discuss the specific molecular drivers of pediatric low grade glioma and how to effectively test for them, review the newest therapeutic agents and their utility in treating this disease, and propose a risk-based stratification system that considers both clinical and molecular parameters to aid clinicians in making treatment decisions."
"The choroid plexus (CP) is a key regulator of the central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis through its secretory, immunological and barrier properties. Accumulating evidence suggests that the CP plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS), but the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. To get a comprehensive view on the role of the CP in MS, we studied transcriptomic alterations of the human CP in progressive MS and non-neurological disease&#xa0;controls using RNA sequencing. We identified 17 genes with significantly higher expression in progressive MS patients relative to that in controls. Among them is the newly described long non-coding RNA HIF1A-AS3. Next to that, we uncovered disease-affected pathways related to hypoxia, secretion and neuroprotection, while only subtle immunological and no barrier alterations were observed. In an ex vivo CP explant model, a subset of the upregulated genes responded in a similar way to hypoxic conditions. Our results suggest a deregulation of the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF)-1 pathway in progressive MS CP. Importantly, cerebrospinal fluid levels of the hypoxia-responsive secreted peptide PAI-1 were higher in MS patients with high disability relative to those with low disability. These findings provide for the first time a complete overview of the CP transcriptome in health and disease, and suggest that the CP environment becomes hypoxic in progressive MS patients, highlighting the altered secretory and neuroprotective properties of the CP under neuropathological conditions. Together, these findings provide novel insights to target the CP and promote the secretion of neuroprotective factors into the CNS of progressive MS patients."
"Despite ongoing research efforts, mechanisms of brain aging are still enigmatic and need to be elucidated for a better understanding of age-associated cognitive decline. The aim of this study is to investigate aging in the prefrontal cortex region of human brain in a meta-analysis of transcriptome datasets. We analyzed 591 gene expression datasets pertaining to female and male human prefrontal cortex biopsies of distinct ages. We used hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the influence of sex and age on global transcriptome levels. In sex-specific analysis we identified genes correlating with age and differentially expressed between groups of young, middle-aged and aged. Pathways and gene ontologies (GOs) over-represented in the resulting gene sets were calculated. Potential causal relationships between genes and between GOs were explored employing the Granger test of gene expression time series over the range of ages. The most outstanding results were the age-related decline of synaptic transmission and activated expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in both sexes. We found an antagonistic relationship between calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase IV (CAMK4) and GFAP which may include regulatory mechanisms involving cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK, alias ERK). Common to both sexes was a decline in synaptic transmission, neurogenesis and an increased base-level of inflammatory and immune-related processes. Furthermore, we detected differences in dendritic spine morphogenesis, catecholamine signaling and cellular responses to external stimuli, particularly to metal (Zinc and cadmium) ions which were higher in female brains."
"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare disease with a fatal outcome. To date, little is known about the molecular processes underlying disease development. Its clinical overlap with related neurodegenerative movement disorders underlines the importance for expanding the knowledge of pathological brain processes in MSA patients to improve distinction from similar diseases. In the current study, we investigated DNA methylation changes in brain samples from 41 MSA patients and 37 healthy controls. We focused on the prefrontal cortex, a moderately affected area in MSA. Using Illumina MethylationEPIC arrays, we investigated 5-methylcytosine (5mC) as well as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) changes throughout the genome. We identified five significantly different 5mC probes (adj. P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), of which one probe mapping to the AREL1 gene involved in antigen presentation was decreased in MSA patients. This decrease correlated with increased 5hmC levels. Further, we identified functional DNA methylation modules involved in inflammatory processes. As expected, the decreased 5mC levels on AREL1 was concordant with increased gene expression levels of both AREL1 as well as MHC Class I HLA genes in MSA brains. We also investigated whether these changes in antigen-related processes in the brain associated with changes in peripheral mononuclear cells. Using flow cytometry on an independent cohort of MSA patients, we identified a decrease in circulating non-classical CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>++</sup> blood monocytes, whereas T and NK cell populations were unchanged. Taken together, our results support the view of an active neuroimmune response in brains of MSA patients."
"Autosomal dominant missense mutations in BICD2 cause Spinal Muscular Atrophy Lower Extremity Predominant 2 (SMALED2), a developmental disease of motor neurons. BICD2 is a key component of the cytoplasmic dynein/dynactin motor complex, which in axons drives the microtubule-dependent retrograde transport of intracellular cargo towards the cell soma. Patients with pathological mutations in BICD2 develop malformations of cortical and cerebellar development similar to Bicd2 knockout (-/-) mice. In this study we sought to re-examine the motor neuron phenotype of conditional Bicd2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Bicd2<sup>-/-</sup> mice show a significant reduction in the number of large calibre motor neurons of the L4 ventral root compared to wild type mice. Muscle-specific knockout of Bicd2 results in a similar reduction in L4 ventral axons comparable to global Bicd2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Rab6, a small GTPase required for the sorting of exocytic vesicles from the Trans Golgi Network to the plasma membrane is a major binding partner of BICD2. We therefore examined the secretory pathway in SMALED2 patient fibroblasts and demonstrated that BICD2 is required for physiological flow of constitutive secretory cargoes from the Trans Golgi Network to the plasma membrane using a VSV-G reporter assay. Together, these data indicate that BICD2 loss from muscles is a major driver of non-cell autonomous pathology in the motor nervous system, which has important implications for future therapeutic approaches in SMALED2."
"Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an autosomal dominant inborn error of heme biosynthesis due to a pathogenic mutation in the Hmbs gene, resulting in half-normal activity of hydroxymethylbilane synthase. Factors that induce hepatic heme biosynthesis induce episodic attacks in heterozygous patients. The clinical presentation of acute attacks involves the signature neurovisceral pain and may include psychiatric symptoms. Here we used a knock-in mouse line that is biallelic for the Hmbs c.500G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A (p.R167Q) mutation with ~&#x2009;5% of normal hydroxymethylbilane synthase activity to unravel the consequences of severe HMBS deficiency on affective behavior and brain physiology. Hmbs knock-in mice (KI mice) model the rare homozygous dominant form of AIP and were used as tool to elucidate the hitherto unknown pathophysiology of the behavioral manifestations of the disease and its neural underpinnings. Extensive behavioral analyses revealed a selective depression-like phenotype in Hmbs KI mice; transcriptomic and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated aberrant myelination. The uncovered compromised mitochondrial function in the hippocampus of knock-in mice and its ensuing neurogenic and neuroplastic deficits lead us to propose a mechanistic role for disrupted mitochondrial energy production in the pathogenesis of the behavioral consequences of severe HMBS deficiency and its neuropathological sequelae in the brain."
"Meningioma represents the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Recently several non-NF2 mutations in meningioma have been identified and correlated with certain pathological subtypes, locations and clinical observations. Alterations of cellular pathways due to these mutations, however, have largely remained elusive. Here we report that the Krueppel like factor 4 (KLF4)-K409Q mutation in skull base meningiomas triggers a distinct tumor phenotype. Transcriptomic analysis of 17 meningioma samples revealed that KLF4<sup>K409Q</sup> mutated tumors harbor an upregulation of hypoxia dependent pathways. Detailed in vitro investigation further showed that the KLF4<sup>K409Q</sup> mutation induces HIF-1&#x3b1; through the reduction of prolyl hydroxylase activity and causes an upregulation of downstream HIF-1&#x3b1; targets. Finally, we demonstrate that KLF4<sup>K409Q</sup> mutated tumors are susceptible to mTOR inhibition by Temsirolimus. Taken together, our data link the KLF4<sup>K409Q</sup> mediated upregulation of HIF pathways to the clinical and biological characteristics of these skull base meningiomas possibly opening new therapeutic avenues for this distinct meningioma subtype."
"Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in multiple neurodegenerative diseases but remains largely unexplored in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Here, we characterize the mitochondrial respiratory chain at the individual neuron level in the MM1 and VV2 common molecular subtypes of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Moreover, we investigate the associations between the mitochondrial respiratory chain and neuropathological markers of the disease.Brain tissue from individuals with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and age-matched controls were obtained from the brain collection of the Austrian Creutzfeldt-Jakob Surveillance. The mitochondrial respiratory chain was studied through a dichotomous approach of immunoreactivities in the temporal cortex and the hippocampal subregions of CA4 and CA3.We show that profound deficiency of all mitochondrial respiratory complexes (I-V) occurs in neurons of the severely affected temporal cortex of patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This deficiency correlates strongly with the severity of neuropathological changes, including vacuolation of the neuropil, gliosis and disease associated prion protein load. Respiratory chain deficiency is less pronounced in hippocampal CA4 and CA3 regions compared to the temporal cortex. In both areas respiratory chain deficiency shows a predilection for the MM1 molecular subtype of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.Our findings indicate that aberrant mitochondrial respiration could be involved early in the pathogenesis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and contributes to neuronal death, most likely via ATP depletion. Based on these results, we propose that the restricted MRI diffusion profile seen in the brain of patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease might reflect cytotoxic changes due to neuronal respiratory chain failure and ATP loss."
"Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by extensive tumor cell invasion, angiogenesis, and proliferation. We previously established subclones of GBM cells with distinct invasive phenotypes and identified annexin A2 (ANXA2) as an activator of angiogenesis and perivascular invasion. Here, we further explored the role of ANXA2 in regulating phenotypic transition in GBM. We identified oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) as a key ANXA2 target gene in GBM utilizing microarray analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis of the Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. Overexpression of ANXA2 in GBM cells increased the expression of OSMR and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and enhanced cell invasion, angiogenesis, proliferation, and mesenchymal transition. Silencing of OSMR reversed the ANXA2-induced phenotype, and STAT3 knockdown reduced OSMR protein expression. Exposure of GBM cells to hypoxic conditions activated the ANXA2-STAT3-OSMR signaling axis. Mice bearing ANXA2-overexpressing GBM exhibited shorter survival times compared with control tumor-bearing mice, whereas OSMR knockdown increased the survival time and diminished ANXA2-mediated tumor invasion, angiogenesis, and growth. Further, we uncovered a significant relationship between ANXA2 and OSMR expression in clinical GBM specimens, and demonstrated their correlation with tumor histopathology and patient prognosis. Our results indicate that the ANXA2-STAT3-OSMR axis regulates malignant phenotypic changes and mesenchymal transition in GBM, suggesting that this axis is a promising therapeutic target to treat GBM aggressiveness."
"Although abnormal mitosis with disarranged metaphase chromosomes or many micronuclei in astrocytes (named ""Alzheimer I type astrocytes"" and later ""Creutzfeldt-Peters cells"") have been known for nearly 100&#x2009;years, the origin and mechanisms of this pathology remain elusive. In experimental brain insults in rats, we show that abnormal mitoses that are not followed by cytokinesis are typical for reactive astrocytes. The pathology originates due to the inability of the cells to form normal mitotic spindles with subsequent metaphase chromosome congression, which, in turn may be due to shape constraints aggravated by cellular enlargement and to the accumulation of large amounts of cytosolic proteins. Many astrocytes escape from arrested mitosis by producing micronuclei. These polyploid astrocytes can survive for long periods of time and enter into new cell cycles."
"Most cases of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) harbor pathogenic autoantibodies against the water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4). Binding of these antibodies to AQP4 on astrocytes initiates damage to these cells, which culminates in the formation of large tissue destructive lesions in the central nervous system (CNS). Consequently, untreated patients may become permanently blind or paralyzed. Studies on the induction and breakage of tolerance to AQP4 could be of great benefit for NMOSD patients. So far, however, all attempts to create suitable animal models by active sensitization have failed. We addressed this challenge and identified peptides, which mimic the conformational AQP4 epitopes recognized by pathogenic antibodies of NMOSD patients. Here we show that these mimotopes can induce the production of AQP4-reactive antibodies in Lewis rats. Hence, our results provide a conceptual framework for the formation of such antibodies in NMOSD patients, and aid to improve immunization strategies for the creation of animal models suitable for tolerance studies in this devastating disease."
"Cellular damage associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) manifests in motor and cognitive dysfunction following injury. Experimental models of TBI reveal cell death in the granule cell layer (GCL) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus acutely after injury. Adult-born neurons residing in the neurogenic niche of the GCL, the subgranular zone, are particularly vulnerable. Injury-induced proliferation of neural progenitors in the subgranular zone supports recovery of the immature neuron population, but their development and localization may be altered, potentially affecting long-term survival. Here we show that increasing hippocampal levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) is sufficient to promote end-stage maturity of posttrauma-born neurons and improve cognition following TBI. Mice with conditional overexpression of astrocyte-specific IGF1 and wild-type mice received controlled cortical impact or sham injury and bromo-2'-deoxyuridine injections for 7d after injury to label proliferating cells. IGF1 overexpression increased the number of GCL neurons born acutely after trauma that survived 6&#x2009;weeks to maturity (NeuN+BrdU+), and enhanced their outward migration into the GCL while significantly reducing the proportion localized ectopically to the hilus and molecular layer. IGF1 selectively affected neurons, without increasing the persistence of posttrauma-proliferated glia in the dentate gyrus. IGF1 overexpressing animals performed better during radial arm water maze reversal testing, a neurogenesis-dependent cognitive test. These findings demonstrate the ability of IGF1 to promote the long-term survival and appropriate localization of granule neurons born acutely after a TBI, and suggest these new neurons contribute to improved cognitive function."
"Chronic epilepsy has been associated with hippocampal abnormalities like neuronal loss, gliosis and granule cell dispersion. The granule cell layer of a normal human hippocampal dentate gyrus is traditionally regarded as a compact neuron-dense layer. Histopathological studies of surgically resected or autopsied hippocampal samples primarily from temporal lobe epilepsy patients, as well as animal models of epilepsy, describe variable patterns of granule cell dispersion including focal cell clusters, broader thick segments, and bilamination or ""tram-tracking"". Although most studies have implicated granule cell dispersion as a specific feature of chronic epilepsy, very few ""non-seizure"" controls were included in these published investigations. Our retrospective survey of 147 cadaveric pediatric human hippocampi identified identical morphological spectra of granule cell dispersion in both normal and seizure-affected brains. Moreover, sections across the entire antero-posterior axis of a control cadaveric hippocampus revealed repetitive occurrence of different morphologies of the granule cell layer - compact, focally disaggregated and bilaminar. The results indicate that granule cell dispersion is within the spectrum of normal variation and not unique to patients with epilepsy. We speculate that sampling bias has been responsible for an erroneous dogma, which we hope to rectify with this investigation."
"Amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) associates with extracellular vesicles termed exosomes. It is not clear whether and how exosomes modulate A&#x3b2; neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We show here that brain tissue and serum from the transgenic mouse model of familial AD (5xFAD) and serum from AD patients contains ceramide-enriched and astrocyte-derived exosomes (termed astrosomes) that are associated with A&#x3b2;. In Neuro-2a cells, primary cultured neurons, and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, A&#x3b2;-associated astrosomes from 5xFAD mice and AD patient serum were specifically transported to mitochondria, induced mitochondrial clustering, and upregulated the fission protein Drp-1 at a concentration corresponding to 5 femtomoles A&#x3b2;/L of medium. A&#x3b2;-associated astrosomes, but not wild type or control human serum exosomes, mediated binding of A&#x3b2; to voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) and subsequently, activated caspases. A&#x3b2;-associated astrosomes induced neurite fragmentation and neuronal cell death, suggesting that association with astrosomes substantially enhances A&#x3b2; neurotoxicity in AD and may comprise a novel target for therapy."
"The spreading and accumulation of &#x3b1;-synuclein and dopaminergic neurodegeneration, two hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD), have been faithfully reproduced in rodent brains by chronic, oral administration of &#x3b2;-sitosterol &#x3b2;-D-glucoside (BSSG). We investigated whether a single injection of BSSG (6&#x2009;&#x3bc;g BSSG/&#x3bc;L DMSO) in the left substantia nigra of Wistar rats causes the same effects. Mock DMSO injections and untreated rats formed control groups. We performed immunostainings against the pathological &#x3b1;-synuclein, the dopaminergic marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the neuroskeleton marker &#x3b2;-III tubulin, the neurotensin receptor type 1 (NTSR1) as non-dopaminergic phenotype marker and Fluro-Jade C (F-J C) label for neurodegeneration. Using &#x3b2;-galactosidase (&#x3b2;-Gal) assay and active caspase-3 immunostaining, we assessed cell death mechanisms. Golgi-Cox staining was used to measure the density and types of dendritic spines of striatal medium spiny neurons. Motor and non-motor alterations were also evaluated. The study period comprised 15 to 120&#x2009;days after the lesion. In the injured substantia nigra, BSSG caused a progressive &#x3b1;-synuclein aggregation and dopaminergic neurodegeneration caused by senescence and apoptosis. The &#x3b1;-synuclein immunoreactivity was also present within microglia cells. Decreased density of dopaminergic fibers and dendritic spines also occurred in the striatum. Remarkably, all the histopathological changes also appeared on the contralateral nigrostriatal system, and &#x3b1;-synuclein aggregates were present in other brain regions. Motor and non-motor behavioral alterations were progressive. Our data show that the stereotaxic BSSG administration reproduces PD &#x3b1;-synucleinopathy phenotype in the rat. This approach will aid in identifying the spread mechanism of &#x3b1;-synuclein pathology and validate anti-synucleinopathy therapies."
"Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APS) are symptomatically characterized by parkinsonism, with the latter presenting additionally a distinctive range of atypical features. Although the majority of patients with PD and APS appear to be sporadic, genetic causes of several rare monogenic disease variants were identified. The knowledge acquired from these genetic factors indicated that defects in vesicular transport pathways, endo-lysosomal dysfunction, impaired autophagy-lysosomal protein and organelle degradation pathways, &#x3b1;-synuclein aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction play key roles in PD pathogenesis. Moreover, membrane dynamics are increasingly recognized as a key player in the disease pathogenesis due lipid homeostasis alterations, associated with lysosomal dysfunction, caused by mutations in several PD and APS genes. The importance of lysosomal dysfunction and lipid homeostasis is strengthened by both genetic discoveries and clinical epidemiology of the association between parkinsonism and lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), caused by the disruption of lysosomal biogenesis or function. A synergistic coordination between vesicular trafficking, lysosomal and mitochondria defects exist whereby mutations in PD and APS genes encoding proteins primarily involved one PD pathway are frequently associated with defects in other PD pathways as a secondary effect. Moreover, accumulating clinical and genetic observations suggest more complex inheritance patters of familial PD exist, including oligogenic and polygenic inheritance of genes in the same or interconnected PD pathways, further strengthening their synergistic connection.Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of PD and APS genes with functions in vesicular transport, lysosomal and mitochondrial pathways, and highlight functional and genetic evidence of the synergistic connection between these PD associated pathways."
"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), which may be due to the modulation of neuroinflammation or the impairment of interstitial fluid bulk flow system in the central nervous system. Here, we show an age-dependent impairment of several behavioral outcomes in 5xFAD AQP4 null mice. Twenty-four-hour video recordings and computational analyses of their movement revealed that the nighttime motion of AQP4-deficient 5xFAD mice was progressively reduced between 20 and 36&#x2009;weeks of age, with a sharp deterioration occurring between 30 and 32&#x2009;weeks. This reduction in nighttime motion was accompanied by motor dysfunction and epileptiform neuronal activities, demonstrated by increased abnormal spikes by electroencephalography. In addition, all AQP4-deficient 5xFAD mice exhibited convulsions at least once during the period of the analysis. Interestingly, despite such obvious phenotypes, parenchymal amyloid &#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) deposition, reactive astrocytosis, and activated microgliosis surrounding amyloid plaques were unchanged in the AQP4-deficient 5xFAD mice relative to 5xFAD mice. Taken together, our data indicate that AQP4 deficiency greatly accelerates an age-dependent deterioration of neuronal function in 5xFAD mice associated with epileptiform neuronal activity without significantly altering A&#x3b2; deposition or neuroinflammation in this mouse model. We therefore propose that there exists another pathophysiological phase in AD which follows amyloid plaque deposition and neuroinflammation and is sensitive to AQP4 deficiency."
"Infections by opportunistic non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are rising in global incidence. One emerging, slowly growing NTM is Mycobacterium haemophilum, which can cause skin, lung, bone, and soft tissue infections in immunocompromised patients as well as lymphadenitis in immunocompetent individuals. Detection of this microorganism is difficult using conventional culture-based methods and few reports have documented involvement of this pathogen within the central nervous system (CNS).We describe the neuropathologic autopsy findings of a 39-year-old man with AIDS who died secondary to M. haemophilum CNS infection. He initially presented with repeated bouts of pyrexia, nausea and vomiting, and altered mental status that required numerous hospitalizations. CSF infectious workups were consistently negative. His most recent admission identified hyperintensities within the brainstem by MRI and despite antibiotic therapies for suspected CNS infection, he died. Autopsy revealed a swollen brain with marked widening of the brainstem. Microscopic examination of the brain and spinal cord showed focal lymphohistiocytic infiltrates, gliosis and neuronal loss that were associated with acid-fast bacilli (AFB). The brainstem was the most severely damaged and AFB were found to congregate along arterial territories lending support to the notion of hematogenous spread as a mechanism for the organisms' dissemination. 16S rRNA sequencing on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue enabled post-mortem identification of M. haemophilum. This sequencing methodology may permit diagnosis on CSF intra-vitam."
"Analysis of isolated meninges and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of post-mortem MS cases has shown increased gene and protein expression for the pro-inflammatory cytokines: tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon-&#x3b3; (IFN&#x3b3;). Here we tested the hypothesis that persistent production of these cytokines in the meningeal compartment and diffusion into underlying GM can drive chronic MS-like GM pathology. Lentiviral transfer vectors were injected into the sagittal sulcus of DA rats to deliver continuous expression of TNF&#x2009;+&#x2009;IFN&#x3b3; transgenes in the meninges and the resulting neuropathology analysed after 1 and 2&#x2009;months. Injection of TNF&#x2009;+&#x2009;IFN&#x3b3; viral vectors, with or without prior MOG immunisation, induced extensive immune cell infiltration (CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, CD79a&#x2009;+&#x2009;B-cells and macrophages) in the meninges by 28 dpi, which remained at 2&#x2009;months. Control GFP viral vector did not induce infiltration. Subpial demyelination was seen underlying these infiltrates, which was partly dependant on prior myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) immunisation. A significant decrease in neuronal numbers was seen at 28 and 56&#x2009;days in cortical layers II-V that was independent of MOG immunisation. RNA analysis at 28 dpi showed an increase in expression of necroptotic pathway genes, including RIP3, MLKL, cIAP2 and Nox2. PhosphoRIP3+ and phosphoMLKL+ neurons were present in TNF&#x2009;+&#x2009;IFN&#x3b3; vector injected animals, indicating activation of necroptosis. Our results suggest that persistent expression of TNF in the presence of IFN&#x3b3; is a potent inducer of meningeal inflammation and can activate TNF signalling pathways in cortical cells leading to neuronal death and subpial demyelination and thus may contribute to clinical progression in MS."
"Adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma (ACP) is a biologically benign but clinically aggressive lesion that has a significant impact on quality of life. The incidence of the disease has a bimodal distribution, with peaks occurring in children and older adults. Our group previously published the results of a transcriptome analysis of pediatric ACPs that identified several genes that were consistently overexpressed relative to other pediatric brain tumors and normal tissue. We now present the results of a transcriptome analysis comparing pediatric to adult ACP to identify biological differences between these groups that may provide novel therapeutic insights or support the assertion that potential therapies identified through the study of pediatric ACP may also have a role in adult ACP. Using our compiled transcriptome dataset of 27 pediatric and 9 adult ACPs, obtained through the Advancing Treatment for Pediatric Craniopharyngioma Consortium, we interrogated potential age-related transcriptional differences using several rigorous mathematical analyses. These included: canonical differential expression analysis; divisive, agglomerative, and probabilistic based hierarchical clustering; information theory based characterizations; and the deep learning approach, HD Spot. Our work indicates that there is no therapeutically relevant difference in ACP gene expression based on age. As such, potential therapeutic targets identified in pediatric ACP are also likely to have relvance for adult patients."
"Although most commonly benign, neurofibromas (NFs) can have devastating functional and cosmetic effects in addition to the possibility of malignant transformation. In orbitofacial neurofibromatosis type 1, NFs may cause progressive, disfiguring tumors of the lid, brow, temple, face and orbit. The purpose of this study was to identify biological differences between orbitofacial NFs and those occurring at other anatomic sites. We used Illumina Methylation EPIC BeadChip to study DNA methylation differences between orbitofacial NFs (N&#xa0;=&#x2009;20) and NFs at other sites (N&#xa0;=&#x2009;4). Global methylation differences were detected between the two groups and the top differentially methylated genes were part of the HOX&#xa0;(Homebox) family of transcription factors (HOXC8, HOXC4, HOXC6, HOXA6 and HOXD4), which were hypomethylated in orbitofacial NFs compared to the non-orbital NFs. Conversely, LTF (lactoferrin) was relatively hypermethylated in orbitofacial NF compared to non-orbitofacial NF. HOXC8 protein levels were higher in orbitofacial plexiform NFs (p&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.04). We found no significant differences in the expression of HOXC4, HOXA6, or HOXD4 between the two groups. HOXC8 mRNA levels were also higher in orbitofacial NFs and HOXC8 overexpression in a non-neoplastic human Schwann cell line resulted in increased growth. In summary, we identified gene methylation and expression differences between orbitofacial NF and NFs occurring at other locations. Further investigation may be warranted, given that the HOX family of genes play an important role during development, are dysregulated in a variety of cancers, and may provide novel insights into therapeutic approaches."
"RNA modifications are emerging as critical regulators in cancer biology, thanks to their ability to influence gene expression and the predominant protein isoforms expressed during cell proliferation, migration, and other pro-oncogenic properties. The reversibility and dynamic nature of post-transcriptional RNA modifications allow cells to quickly adapt to microenvironmental changes. Recent literature has revealed that the deregulation of RNA modifications can promote a plethora of developmental diseases, including tumorigenesis. In this review, we will focus on four key post-transcriptional RNA modifications which have been identified as contributors to the pathogenesis of brain tumors: m<sup>6</sup>A, alternative polyadenylation, alternative splicing and adenosine to inosine modifications. In addition to the role of RNA modifications in brain tumor progression, we will also discuss potential opportunities to target these processes to improve the dismal prognosis for brain tumors."
"To test the hypothesis that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could provide a spreading route for pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we have examined the effects of intraventricular infusion during 2 weeks of pooled CSF samples from sporadic ALS patients or control CSF samples into transgenic mice expressing human TDP43<sup>WT</sup> which do not develop pathological phenotypes. Infusion of ALS-CSF, but not of control CSF, triggered motor and cognitive dysfunction, as well as ALS-like pathological changes including TDP43 proteinopathy, neurofilament disorganization and neuroinflammation. In addition, the neuron-specific translational profiles from peptide analyses of immunoprecipitated ribosomes revealed dysregulation of multiple protein networks in response to ALS-CSF altering cytoskeletal organization, vesicle trafficking, mitochondrial function, and cell metabolism. With normal mice, similar ALS-CSF infusion induced mild motor dysfunction but without significant TDP43 pathology in spinal neurons. We conclude that the CSF from sporadic ALS contains factors that can transmit and disseminate disease including TDP43 proteinopathy into appropriate recipient animal model expressing human TDP43. These findings open new research avenues for the discovery of etiogenic factors for sporadic ALS and for the testing of drugs aiming to neutralize the ALS-CSF toxicity."

"Immunotherapies targeting pathological tau have recently emerged as a promising approach for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. We have previously showed that the mouse antibody DC8E8 discriminates between healthy and pathological tau, reduces tau pathology in murine tauopathy models and inhibits neuronal internalization of AD tau species in vitro.Here we show, that DC8E8 and antibodies elicited against the first-in-man tau vaccine, AADvac1, which is based on the DC8E8 epitope peptide, both promote uptake of pathological tau by mouse primary microglia. IgG1 and IgG4 isotypes of AX004, the humanized versions of DC8E8, accelerate tau uptake by human primary microglia isolated from post-mortem aged and diseased brains. This promoting activity requires the presence of the Fc-domain of the antibodies.The IgG1 isotype of AX004 showed greater ability to promote tau uptake compared to the IgG4 isotype, while none of the antibody-tau complexes provoked increased pro-inflammatory activity of microglia. Our data suggest that IgG1 has better suitability for therapeutic development."
"Prominent features of HD neuropathology are the intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions of huntingtin and striatal and cortical neuronal cell death. Recently, synaptic defects have been reported on HD-related studies, including impairment of neurotransmitter release and alterations of synaptic components. However, the definite characteristics of synapse dysfunction and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. We studied the gene expression levels and patterns of a number of proteins forming the cytoskeletal matrix of the presynaptic active zones in HD transgenic mice (R6/1), in hippocampal neuronal cultures overexpressing mutant huntingtin and in postmortem brain tissues of HD patients. To investigate the interactions between huntingtin and active proteins, we performed confocal microscopic imaging and immunoprecipitation in mouse and HEK 293 cell line models. The mRNA and protein levels of Bassoon were reduced in mouse and cell culture models of HD and in brain tissues of patients with HD. Moreover, a striking re-distribution of a complex of proteins including Bassoon, Piccolo and Munc 13-1 from the cytoplasm and synapses into intranuclear huntingtin aggregates with loss of active zone proteins and dendritic spines. This re-localization was age-dependent and coincided with the formation of huntingtin aggregates. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that huntingtin interacts with Bassoon, and that this interaction is likely mediated by a third linking protein. Three structural proteins involved in neurotransmitter release in the presynaptic active zones of neurons are altered in expression and that the proteins are redistributed from their normal functional site into mutant huntingtin aggregates."
"Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors, but meningioma metastases are rare. Accordingly, the clinical workup, diagnostic testing, and molecular classification of metastatic meningioma is incompletely understood. Here, we present a case report of multiply recurrent meningioma complicated by liver metastasis. We discuss the patient presentation, imaging findings, and conventional histopathologic characterization of both the intracranial lesion and the metastatic focus. Further, we perform multiplatform molecular profiling, comprised of DNA methylation arrays and RNA-sequencing, of six stereotactically-guided samples from the intracranial meningioma and a single ultrasound-guided liver metastasis biopsy. Our results show that DNA methylation clusters distinguish the liver metastasis from the intracranial meningioma samples, and identify a small focus of hepatocyte contamination with the liver biopsy. Nonetheless, DNA methylation-based classification accurately identifies the liver metastasis as a meningioma with high confidence. We also find that clustering of RNA-sequencing results distinguishes the liver metastasis from the intracranial meningiomas samples, but that differential gene expression classification is confounded by hepatocyte-specific gene expression programs in the liver metastasis. In sum, this case report sheds light on the comparative biology of intracranial and metastatic meningioma. Furthermore, our results support methylation-based classification as a robust method of diagnosing metastatic lesions, underscore the broad utility of DNA methylation array profiling in diagnostic pathology, and caution against the routine use of bulk RNA-sequencing for identifying tumor signatures in heterogeneous metastatic lesions."
"Synaptojanin 1 (SYNJ1) is a brain-enriched lipid phosphatase critically involved in autophagosomal/endosomal trafficking, synaptic vesicle recycling and metabolism of phosphoinositides. Previous studies suggest that SYNJ1 polymorphisms have significant impact on the age of onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that SYNJ1 is involved in amyloid-induced toxicity. Yet SYNJ1 protein level and cellular localization in post-mortem human AD brain tissues have remained elusive. This study aimed to examine whether SYNJ1 localization and expression are altered in post-mortem AD brains. We found that SYNJ1 is accumulated in Hirano bodies, plaque-associated dystrophic neurites and some neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). SYNJ1 immunoreactivity was higher in neurons and in the senile plaques in AD patients carrying one or two ApolipoproteinE (APOE) &#x3b5;4 allele(s). In two large cohorts of APOE-genotyped controls and AD patients, SYNJ1 transcripts were significantly increased in AD temporal isocortex compared to control. There was a significant increase in SYNJ1 transcript in APOE&#x3b5;4 carriers compared to non-carriers in AD cohort. SYNJ1 was systematically co-enriched with PHF-tau in the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction of AD brain. In the RIPA-insoluble fraction containing protein aggregates, SYNJ1 proteins were significantly increased and observed as a smear containing full-length and cleaved fragments in AD brains. In vitro cleavage assay showed that SYNJ1 is a substrate of calpain, which is highly activated in AD brains. Our study provides evidence of alterations in SYNJ1 mRNA level and SYNJ1 protein degradation, solubility and localization in AD brains."
"Enlarged early endosomes have been visualized in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS) using conventional confocal microscopy at a resolution corresponding to endosomal size (hundreds of nm). In order to overtake the diffraction limit, we used super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM) and transmission electron microscopies (TEM) to analyze the early endosomal compartment in DS.By immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, we confirmed that the volume of Early Endosome Antigen 1 (EEA1)-positive puncta was 13-19% larger in fibroblasts and iPSC-derived neurons from individuals with DS, and in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCN) of the Ts65Dn mice modelling DS. However, EEA1-positive structures imaged by TEM or SR-SIM after chemical fixation had a normal size but appeared clustered. In order to disentangle these discrepancies, we imaged optimally preserved High Pressure Freezing (HPF)-vitrified DS fibroblasts by TEM and found that early endosomes were 75% denser but remained normal-sized.RNA sequencing of DS and euploid fibroblasts revealed a subgroup of differentially-expressed genes related to cargo sorting at multivesicular bodies (MVBs). We thus studied the dynamics of endocytosis, recycling and MVB-dependent degradation in DS fibroblasts. We found no change in endocytosis, increased recycling and delayed degradation, suggesting a ""traffic jam"" in the endosomal compartment.Finally, we show that the phosphoinositide PI (3) P, involved in early endosome fusion, is decreased in DS fibroblasts, unveiling a new mechanism for endosomal dysfunctions in DS and a target for pharmacotherapy."
"In the human prion disease Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), different CJD neuropathological subtypes are defined by the presence in normal prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) of a methionine or valine at residue 129, by the molecular mass of the infectious prion protein PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, by the pattern of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposition, and by the distribution of spongiform change in the brain. Heterozygous cases of CJD potentially add another layer of complexity to defining CJD subtypes since PrP<sup>Sc</sup> can have either a methionine (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-M129) or valine (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-V129) at residue 129. We have recently demonstrated that the relative amount of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-M129 versus PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-V129, i.e. the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> allotype ratio, varies between heterozygous CJD cases. In order to determine if differences in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> allotype correlated with different disease phenotypes, we have inoculated 10 cases of heterozygous CJD (7 sporadic and 3 iatrogenic) into two transgenic mouse lines overexpressing PrP<sup>C</sup> with a methionine at codon 129. In one case, brain-region specific differences in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> allotype appeared to correlate with differences in prion disease transmission and phenotype. In the other 9 cases inoculated, the presence of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-V129 was associated with plaque formation but differences in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> allotype did not consistently correlate with disease incubation time or neuropathology. Thus, while the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> allotype ratio may contribute to diverse prion phenotypes within a single brain, it does not appear to be a primary determinative factor of disease phenotype."
"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) causes neurologic disability due to inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration. Immunosuppressive treatments can modify the disease course but do not effectively promote remyelination or prevent long term neurodegeneration. As a novel approach to mitigate chronic stage pathology, we tested transplantation of mouse induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) into the chronically demyelinated corpus callosum (CC) in adult mice. Male C57BL/6 mice fed 0.3% cuprizone for 12&#x2009;weeks exhibited CC atrophy with chronic demyelination, astrogliosis, and microglial activation. Syngeneic iNSCs were transplanted into the CC after ending cuprizone and perfused for neuropathology 2&#x2009;weeks later. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences for magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), diffusion-weighted imaging (T2), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) quantified CC pathology in live mice before and after iNSC transplantation. Each MRI technique detected progressive CC pathology. Mice that received iNSCs had normalized DTI radial diffusivity, and reduced astrogliosis post-imaging. A motor skill task that engages the CC is Miss-step wheel running, which demonstrated functional deficits from cuprizone demyelination. Transplantation of iNSCs resulted in marked recovery of running velocity. Neuropathology after wheel running showed that iNSC grafts significantly increased host oligodendrocytes and proliferating oligodendrocyte progenitors, while modulating axon damage. Transplanted iNSCs differentiated along astrocyte and oligodendrocyte lineages, without myelinating, and many remained neural&#xa0;stem&#xa0;cells. Our findings demonstrate the applicability of neuroimaging and functional assessments for pre-clinical interventional trials during chronic demyelination and detect improved function from iNSC transplantation. Directly reprogramming fibroblasts into iNSCs facilitates the future translation towards exogenous autologous cell therapies."
"Degeneration of the primary motor cortex is a defining feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is associated with the accumulation of microscopic protein aggregates in neurons and glia. However, little is known about the quantitative burden and pattern of motor cortex proteinopathies across ALS genotypes. We combined quantitative digital image analysis with multi-level generalized linear modelling in an independent cohort of 82 ALS cases to explore the relationship between genotype, total proteinopathy load and cellular vulnerability to aggregate formation. Primary motor cortex phosphorylated (p)TDP-43 burden and microglial activation were more severe in sporadic ALS-TDP disease than C9-ALS. Oligodendroglial pTDP-43 pathology was a defining feature of ALS-TDP in sporadic ALS, C9-ALS and ALS with OPTN, HNRNPA1 or TARDBP mutations. ALS-FUS and ALS-SOD1 showed less cortical proteinopathy in relation to spinal cord pathology than ALS-TDP, where pathology was more evenly spread across the motor cortex-spinal cord axis. Neuronal pTDP-43 aggregates were rare in GAD67+ and Parvalbumin+ inhibitory interneurons, consistent with predominant accumulation in excitatory neurons. Finally, we show that cortical microglia, but not astrocytes, contain pTDP-43. Our findings suggest divergent quantitative, genotype-specific vulnerability of the ALS primary motor cortex to proteinopathies, which may have implications for our understanding of disease pathogenesis and the development of genotype-specific therapies."
"Molecular biomarkers provide both diagnostic and prognostic results for patients with diffuse glioma, the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Here, we used a long-read nanopore-based sequencing technique to simultaneously assess IDH mutation status and MGMT methylation level in 4 human cell lines and 8 fresh human brain tumor biopsies. Currently, these biomarkers are assayed separately, and results can take days to weeks. We demonstrated the use of nanopore Cas9-targeted sequencing (nCATS) to identify IDH1 and IDH2 mutations within 36&#x2009;h and compared this approach against currently used clinical methods. nCATS was also able to simultaneously provide high-resolution evaluation of MGMT methylation levels not only at the promoter region, as with currently used methods, but also at CpGs across the proximal promoter region, the entirety of exon 1, and a portion of intron 1. We compared the methylation levels of all CpGs to MGMT expression in all cell lines and tumors and observed a positive correlation between intron 1 methylation and MGMT expression. Finally, we identified single nucleotide variants in 3 target loci. This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of using nCATS as a clinical tool for cancer precision medicine."
"The RNA binding protein (RBP) RBM45 forms nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions in neurons and glia in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 proteinopathy (FTLD-TDP), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The normal functions of RBM45 are poorly understood, as are the mechanisms by which it forms inclusions in disease. To better understand the normal and pathological functions of RBM45, we evaluated whether the protein functions via association with several membraneless organelles and whether such an association could promote the formation of nuclear RBM45 inclusions. Under basal conditions, RBM45 is diffusely distributed throughout the nucleus and does not localize to membraneless organelles, including nuclear speckles, Cajal bodies, or nuclear gems. During cellular stress, however, nuclear RBM45 undergoes a reversible, RNA-binding dependent incorporation into nuclear stress bodies (NSBs). Chronic stress leads to the persistent association of RBM45 with NSBs and the irreversible accumulation of nuclear RBM45 inclusions. We also quantified the cell type- and disease-specific patterns of RBM45 pathology in ALS, FTLD-TDP, and AD. RBM45 nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions are found in both neurons and glia in ALS, FTLD-TDP, and AD but are absent in non-neurologic disease controls. Across neurodegenerative diseases, RBM45 nuclear inclusion pathology occurs more frequently than cytoplasmic RBM45 inclusion pathology and exhibits cell type-specific variation. Collectively, our results define new stress-associated functions of RBM45, a mechanism for nuclear RBM45 inclusion formation, a role for NSBs in the pathogenesis of ALS, FTLD-TDP, and AD, and further underscore the importance of protein self-association to both the&#xa0;normal and pathological functions of RBPs in these diseases."
"One of remarkable features of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is the great phenotypic variability. Understanding the molecular basis of this variability has important implications for the development of therapeutic approaches. It is well established that, in many cases, phenotypic heterogeneity of sCJD is under control of two determinants: the genotype at the methionine (M)/valine (V) polymorphic codon 129 of the human prion protein gene and the type, 1 or 2, of the pathogenic and disease-related form of the prion protein, PrP<sup>D</sup>. However, this scenario fails to explain the existence of distinct heterozygous sCJDMV2 subtypes, where heterogeneity occurs without any variation of the 129 allotype and PrP<sup>D</sup> type. One of these subtypes, denoted sCJDMV2C, associated with PrP<sup>D</sup> type 2, is characterized by widespread spongiform degeneration of the cerebral cortex (C). The second variant, denoted sCJDMV2K, features prominent deposition of PrP<sup>D</sup> amyloid forming kuru type (K) plaques. Here we used a mass spectrometry based approach to test the hypothesis that phenotypic variability within the sCJDMV2 subtype is at least partly determined by the abundance of 129&#x2009;M and 129&#x2009;V polymorphic forms of proteinase K-resistant PrP<sup>D</sup> (resPrP<sup>D</sup>). Consistent with this hypothesis, our data demonstrated a strong correlation of the MV2C and MV2K phenotypes with the relative populations of protease-resistant forms of the pathogenic prion proteins, resPrP<sup>D</sup>-129&#x2009;M and resPrP<sup>D</sup>-129&#x2009;V, where resPrP<sup>D</sup>-129&#x2009;M dominated in the sCJDMV2C variant and resPrP<sup>D</sup>-129&#x2009;V in the sCJDMV2K variant. This finding suggests an important, previously unrecognized mechanism for phenotypic determination in human prion diseases."
"Tau protein abnormally aggregates in tauopathies, a diverse group of neurologic diseases that includes Alzheimer's disease (AD). In early stages of disease, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and mislocalized, which can contribute to its aggregation and toxicity. We demonstrate that tau phosphorylation at Ser208 (pSer208) promotes microtubule dysfunction and tau aggregation in cultured cells. Comparative assessment of the epitopes recognized by antibodies AT8, CP13, and 7F2 demonstrates that CP13 and 7F2 are specific for tau phosphorylation at Ser202 and Thr205, respectively, independently of the phosphorylation state of adjacent phosphorylation sites. Supporting the involvement of pSer208 in tau pathology, a novel monoclonal antibody 3G12 specific for tau phosphorylation at Ser208 revealed strong reactivity of tau inclusions in the brains of PS19 and rTg4510 transgenic mouse models of tauopathy. 3G12 also labelled neurofibrillary tangles in brains of patients with AD but revealed differential staining compared to CP13 and 7F2 for other types of tau pathologies such as in neuropil threads and neuritic plaques in AD, tufted astrocytes in progressive supranuclear palsy and astrocytic plaques in corticobasal degeneration. These results support the hypothesis that tau phosphorylation at Ser208 strongly contributes to unique types of tau aggregation and may be a reliable marker for the presence of mature&#xa0;neurofibrillary tangles."
"Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of specific phosphorylated protein aggregates in the brain, such as hyperphosphorylated tau (hp-tau) in tauopathies and phosphorylated &#x3b1;-synuclein (p-&#x3b1;Syn) in &#x3b1;-synucleinopathies. The simultaneous accumulation of different proteins is a common event in many neurodegenerative diseases. We herein describe the detection of the phosphorylation and dimerization of &#x3b1;Syn and activation of GSK-3&#x3b2;, a major kinase known to phosphorylate tau and &#x3b1;Syn, in the brains of rTg4510 mice that overexpress human P301L mutant tau. Immunohistochemistry showed p-&#x3b1;Syn aggregates in rTg4510 mice, which were suppressed by doxycycline-mediated decreases in mutant tau expression levels. A semi-quantitative analysis revealed a regional correlation between hp-tau and p-&#x3b1;Syn accumulation in rTg4510 mice. Furthermore, proteinase K-resistant &#x3b1;Syn aggregates were found in the region with excessive hp-tau accumulation in rTg4510 mice, and these aggregates were morphologically different from proteinase K-susceptible p-&#x3b1;Syn aggregates. Western blotting revealed decreases in p-&#x3b1;Syn monomers in TBS- and sarkosyl-soluble fractions and increases in ubiquitinated p-&#x3b1;Syn dimers in sarkosyl-soluble and insoluble fractions in rTg4510 mice. Furthermore, an activated form of GSK-3&#x3b2; was immunohistochemically detected within cells containing both hp-tau and p-&#x3b1;Syn aggregates. A semi-quantitative analysis revealed that increased GSK-3&#x3b2; activity strongly correlated with hp-tau and p-&#x3b1;Syn accumulation in rTg4510 mice. Collectively, the present results suggest that the overexpression of human P301L mutant tau promoted the phosphorylation and dimerization of endogenous &#x3b1;Syn by activating GSK-3&#x3b2; in rTg4510 mice. This synergic effect between tau, &#x3b1;Syn, and GSK-3&#x3b2; may be involved in the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative diseases that show the accumulation of both tau and &#x3b1;Syn."

"During brain development, the nucleus of migrating neurons follows the centrosome and translocates into the leading process. Defects in these migratory events, which affect neuronal migration, cause lissencephaly and other neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the mechanism of nuclear translocation remains elusive. Using whole exome sequencing (WES), we identified a novel nonsense BICD2 variant p.(Lys775Ter) (K775X) from a lissencephaly patient. Interestingly, most BICD2 missense variants have been associated with human spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) without obvious brain malformations. By in utero electroporation, we showed that BicD2 knockdown in mouse embryos inhibited neuronal migration. Surprisingly, we observed severe blockage of neuronal migration in cells overexpressing K775X but not in those expressing wild-type BicD2 or SMA-associated missense variants. The centrosome of the mutant was, on average, positioned farther away from the nucleus, indicating a failure in nuclear translocation without affecting the centrosome movement. Furthermore, BicD2 localized at the nuclear envelope (NE) through its interaction with NE protein Nesprin-2. K775X variant disrupted this interaction and further interrupted the NE recruitment of BicD2 and dynein. Remarkably, fusion of BicD2-K775X with NE-localizing domain KASH resumed neuronal migration. Our results underscore impaired nuclear translocation during neuronal migration as an important pathomechanism of lissencephaly."
"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is characterized by the deposition of the amyloid &#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) protein in the cerebral vasculature and poses a major risk factor for the development of intracerebral haemorrhages (ICH). However, only a minority of patients with CAA develops ICH (CAA-ICH), and to date it is unclear which mechanisms determine why some patients with CAA are more susceptible to haemorrhage than others. We hypothesized that an imbalance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs) contributes to vessel wall weakening. MMP9 plays a role in the degradation of various components of the extracellular matrix as well as of A&#x3b2; and increased MMP9 expression has been previously associated with CAA. TIMP3 is an inhibitor of MMP9 and increased TIMP3 expression in cerebral vessels has also been associated with CAA. In this study, we investigated the expression of MMP9 and TIMP3 in occipital brain tissue of CAA-ICH cases (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11) by immunohistochemistry and compared this to the expression in brain tissue of CAA cases without ICH (CAA-non-haemorrhagic, CAA-NH, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;18). We showed that MMP9 expression is increased in CAA-ICH cases compared to CAA-NH cases. Furthermore, we showed that TIMP3 expression is increased in CAA cases compared to controls without CAA, and that TIMP3 expression is reduced in a subset of CAA-ICH cases compared to CAA-NH cases. In conclusion, in patients with CAA, a disbalance in cerebrovascular MMP9 and TIMP3 expression is associated with CAA-related ICH."
"We report a novel group of clinically aggressive spinal cord ependymomas characterized by Grade III histology, MYCN amplification, an absence of NF2 alterations or other recurrent pathogenic mutations, and a unique methylation classifier profile. Seven cases were found to have MYCN amplification in the course of routine mutational profiling of 552 patients with central nervous system tumors between December 2016 and July of 2019 and an eighth patient was identified from an unrelated set of cases. Methylation array analysis revealed that none of the 8 cases clustered with any of the nine previously described ependymoma methylation subgroups, and 7 of 8 formed their own tight unique cluster. Histologically all cases showed grade III features, and all demonstrated aggressive clinical behavior. These findings are presented in the context of data from three other studies describing similar cases. Therefore, a combined total of 27 MYCN amplified spinal cord ependymoma cases have now been reported in the literature, warranting their consideration as a distinctive subtype of spinal cord ependymoma (SP-EPN-MYCN) with their unique molecular characteristics and aggressive clinical behavior."
"Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) is a neuro-ophthalmic condition characterized by bilateral degeneration of the optic nerves. Although heterozygous mutations in OPA1 represent the most common genetic cause of ADOA, a significant number of cases remain undiagnosed.Here, we describe a family with a strong ADOA history with most family members spanning three generation having childhood onset of visual symptoms. The proband, in addition to optic atrophy, had neurological symptoms consistent with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Clinical exome analysis detected a novel mutation in the AFG3L2 gene (NM_006796.2:c.1010G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A; p.G337E), which segregated with optic atrophy in family members. AFG3L2 is a metalloprotease of the AAA subfamily which exerts quality control in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Interestingly, the identified mutation localizes close to the AAA domain of AFG3L2, while those localized in the proteolytic domain cause dominant spinocerebellar ataxia type 28 (SCA28) or recessive spastic ataxia with epilepsy (SPAX5). Functional studies in patient fibroblasts demonstrate that the p.G337E AFG3L2 mutation strongly destabilizes the long isoforms of OPA1 via OMA hyper-activation and leads to mitochondrial fragmentation, thus explaining the family phenotype. This study widens the clinical spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases caused by AFG3L2 mutations, which shall be considered as genetic cause of ADOA."
"Accumulation of misfolded phosphorylated Tau (Tauopathy) can be triggered by mutations or by trauma, and is associated with synapse loss, gliosis, neurodegeneration and memory deficits. Fyn kinase physically associates with Tau and regulates subcellular distribution. Here, we assessed whether pharmacological Fyn inhibition alters Tauopathy. In P301S transgenic mice, chronic Fyn inhibition prevented deficits in spatial memory and passive avoidance learning. The behavioral improvement was coupled with reduced accumulation of phospho-Tau in the hippocampus, with reductions in glial activation and with recovery of presynaptic markers. We extended this analysis to a trauma model in which very mild repetitive closed head injury was paired with chronic variable stress over 2&#x2009;weeks to produce persistent memory deficits and Tau accumulation. In this model, Fyn inhibition beginning 24&#x2009;h after the trauma ended rescued memory performance and reduced phospho-Tau accumulation. Thus, inhibition of Fyn kinase may have therapeutic benefit in clinical Tauopathies."
"Diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor (DLGNT) was introduced, for the first time, as a provisional entity in the 2016 WHO classification of central nervous system tumors. DLGNT mainly occur in children and characterized by a widespread leptomeningeal growth occasionally associated with intraspinal tumor nodules, an oligodendroglial-like cytology, glioneuronal differentiation and MAP-Kinase activation associated with either solitary 1p deletion or 1p/19q codeletion in the absence of IDH mutation.We report here two unexpected DLGNTs adult cases, characterized by a unique supratentorial circumscribed intraparenchymal tumor without leptomeningeal involvement in spite of long follow-up. In both cases, the diagnosis of DLGNT was made after DNA-methylation profiling which demonstrated that one case belonged to the DLGNT class whereas the other remained not classifiable but showed on CNV the characteristic genetic findings recorded in DLGNT. Both cases harbored 1p/19q codeletion associated with KIAA1549:BRAF fusion in one case and with BRAF V600E and PIK3CA E545A mutations, in the other.Our study enlarges the clinical and molecular spectrum of DLGNTs, and points out that the terminology of DLGNTs is not fully appropriate since some cases could have neither diffuse growth nor leptomeningeal dissemination. This suggests that DLGNTs encompass a wide spectrum of tumors that has yet to be fully clarified."
"The Src family non-receptor tyrosine kinase Fyn has been implicated in neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease through interaction with amyloid &#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;). However, the role of Fyn in the pathogenesis of primary tauopathies such as FTDP-17, where A&#x3b2; plaques are absent, is poorly understood. In the current study, we used AAV2/8 vectors to deliver tau<sup>P301L</sup> to the brains of WT and Fyn KO mice, generating somatic transgenic tauopathy models with the presence or absence of Fyn. Although both genotypes developed tau pathology, Fyn KO developed fewer neurofibrillary tangles on Bielschowsky and Thioflavin S stained sections and showed lower levels of phosphorylated tau. In addition, tau<sup>P301L</sup>-induced behavior abnormalities and depletion of synaptic proteins were not observed in the Fyn KO model. Our work provides evidence for Fyn being a critical protein in the disease pathogenesis of FTDP-17."
"Fusions involving neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) genes are detected in &#x2264;2% of gliomas and can promote gliomagenesis. The remarkable therapeutic efficacy of TRK inhibitors, which are among the first Food and Drug Administration-approved targeted therapies for NTRK-fused gliomas, has generated significant clinical interest in characterizing these tumors. In this multi-institutional retrospective study of 42 gliomas with NTRK fusions, next generation DNA sequencing (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;41), next generation RNA sequencing (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1), RNA-sequencing fusion panel (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;16), methylation profile analysis (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;18), and histologic evaluation (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;42) were performed. All infantile NTRK-fused gliomas (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7) had high-grade histology and, with one exception, no other significant genetic alterations. Pediatric NTRK-fused gliomas (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;13) typically involved NTRK2, ranged from low- to high-histologic grade, and demonstrated histologic overlap with desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma, pilocytic astrocytoma, ganglioglioma, and glioblastoma, among other entities, but they rarely matched with high confidence to known methylation class families or with each other; alterations involving ATRX, PTEN, and CDKN2A/2B were present in a subset of cases. Adult NTRK-fused gliomas (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;22) typically involved NTRK1 and had predominantly high-grade histology; genetic alterations involving IDH1, ATRX, TP53, PTEN, TERT promoter, RB1, CDKN2A/2B, NF1, and polysomy 7 were common. Unsupervised principal component analysis of methylation profiles demonstrated no obvious grouping by histologic grade, NTRK gene involved, or age group. KEGG pathway analysis detected methylation differences in genes involved in PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and other pathways. In summary, the study highlights the clinical, histologic, and molecular heterogeneity of NTRK-fused gliomas, particularly when stratified by age group."
"A pathogenic GGGCCC hexanucleotide expansion in the first intron/promoter region of the C9orf72 gene is the most common mutation associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The C9orf72 gene product forms a complex with SMCR8 (Smith-Magenis Syndrome Chromosome Region, Candidate 8) and WDR41 (WD Repeat domain 41) proteins. Recent studies have indicated roles for the complex in autophagy regulation, vesicle trafficking, and immune response in transgenic mice, however a direct connection with ALS etiology remains unclear. With the aim of increasing understanding of the multi-functional C9orf72-SMCR8-WDR41 complex, we determined by mass spectrometry analysis the proteins that directly associate with SMCR8. SMCR8 protein binds many components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and we demonstrate its poly-ubiquitination without obvious degradation. Evidence is also presented for localization of endogenous SMCR8 protein to cytoplasmic stress granules. However, in several cell lines we failed to reproduce previous observations that C9orf72 protein enters these granules. SMCR8 protein associates with many products of genes associated with various Mendelian neurological disorders in addition to ALS, implicating SMCR8-containing complexes in a range of neuropathologies. We reinforce previous observations that SMCR8 and C9orf72 protein levels are positively linked, and now show in vivo that SMCR8 protein levels are greatly reduced in brain tissues of C9orf72 gene expansion carrier individuals. While further study is required, these data suggest that SMCR8 protein level might prove a useful biomarker for the C9orf72 expansion in ALS."
"Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the transmission and accumulation of toxic species of &#x3b1;-synuclein (&#x3b1;-syn). Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are believed to play a vital role in the spread of toxic &#x3b1;-syn species. Recently, peripheral &#x3b1;-syn pathology has been investigated, but little attention has been devoted to erythrocytes, which contain abundant &#x3b1;-syn. In this study, we first demonstrated that erythrocyte-derived EVs isolated from Parkinson's disease patients carried elevated levels of oligomeric &#x3b1;-syn, compared to those from healthy controls. Moreover, human erythrocyte-derived EVs, when injected into peripheral blood in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, were found to readily cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). These EVs accumulated in astrocyte endfeet, a component of the BBB, where they impaired glutamate uptake, likely via interaction between excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) and oligomeric &#x3b1;-syn. These data suggest that erythrocyte-derived EVs and the oligomeric &#x3b1;-syn carried in them may play critical roles in the progression or even initiation of Parkinson's disease. Additionally, the mechanisms involved are attributable at least in part to dysfunction of astrocytes induced by these EVs. These observations provide new insight into the understanding of the mechanisms involved in Parkinson's disease."
"Four molecular types of rare central nervous system (CNS) tumors have been recently identified by gene methylation profiling: CNS Neuroblastoma with FOXR2 activation (CNS NB-FOXR2), CNS Ewing Sarcoma Family Tumor with CIC alteration (CNS EFT-CIC), CNS high grade neuroepithelial tumor with MN1 alteration (CNS HGNET-MN1) and CNS high grade neuroepithelial tumor with BCOR alteration (CNS HGNET-BCOR). Although they are not represented in 2016 updated WHO classification of CNS tumors, their diagnostic recognition is important because of clinical consequences. We have introduced a diagnostic method based on transcription profiling of tumor specific signature genes from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor blocks using NanoString nCounter Technology. Altogether, 14 out of 187 (7.4%) high grade pediatric brain tumors were diagnosed with either of four new CNS categories. Histopathological examination of the tumors confirmed, that they demonstrate a spectrum of morphology mimicking other CNS high grade tumors. However, they also exhibit some suggestive histopathological and immunohistochemical features that allow for a presumptive diagnosis prior to molecular assessment. Clinical characteristics of patients corroborated with the previous findings for CNS EFT-CIC, CNS NB-FOXR2 and CNS HGNET-MN1 patients, with a favorable survival rate for the latter two groups. Among six CNS HGNET-BCOR patients, three patients are long term survivors, suggesting possible heterogeneity within this molecular category of tumors. In summary, we confirmed the effectiveness of NanoString method using a single, multi-gene tumor specific signature and recommend this novel approach for identification of either one of the four newly described CNS tumor entities."
"Protein inclusions containing the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 are a pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurodegenerative disorders. The loss of TDP-43 function that is associated with these inclusions affects post-transcriptional processing of RNAs in multiple ways including pre-mRNA splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport, modulation of mRNA stability and translation. In contrast, less is known about the role of TDP-43 in axonal RNA metabolism in motoneurons. Here we show that depletion of Tdp-43 in primary motoneurons affects axon growth. This defect is accompanied by subcellular transcriptome alterations in the axonal and somatodendritic compartment. The axonal localization of transcripts encoding components of the cytoskeleton, the translational machinery and transcripts involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism were particularly affected by loss of Tdp-43. Accordingly, we observed reduced protein synthesis and disturbed mitochondrial functions in axons of Tdp-43-depleted motoneurons. Treatment with nicotinamide rescued the axon growth defect associated with loss of Tdp-43. These results show that Tdp-43 depletion in motoneurons affects several pathways integral to axon health indicating that loss of TDP-43 function could thus make a major contribution to axonal pathomechanisms in ALS."
"It was recently revealed that gut microbiota promote amyloid-beta (A&#x3b2;) burden in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanisms when using either germ-free (GF) housing conditions or treatments with antibiotics (ABX) remained unknown. In this study, we show that GF and ABX-treated 5x familial AD (5xFAD) mice developed attenuated hippocampal A&#x3b2; pathology and associated neuronal loss, and thereby delayed disease-related memory deficits. While A&#x3b2; production remained unaffected in both GF and ABX-treated 5xFAD mice, we noticed in GF 5xFAD mice enhanced microglial A&#x3b2; uptake at early stages of the disease compared to ABX-treated 5xFAD mice. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing of hippocampal microglia from SPF, GF and ABX-treated 5xFAD mice revealed distinct microbiota-dependent gene expression profiles associated with phagocytosis and altered microglial activation states. Taken together, we observed that constitutive or induced microbiota modulation in 5xFAD mice differentially controls microglial A&#x3b2; clearance mechanisms preventing neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits."
"Leukotrienes (LTs) contribute to the neuropathology of chronic neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), where they mediate neuroinflammation and neuronal cell-death. In consequence, blocking the action of Leukotrienes (LTs) ameliorates pathologies and improves cognitive function in animal models of neurodegeneration. Surprisingly, the source of Leukotrienes (LTs) in the brain is largely unknown. Here, we identified the Leukotriene (LT) synthesis rate-limiting enzyme 5-Lipoxygenase (5-Lox) primarily in neurons and to a lesser extent in a subpopulation of microglia in human Alzheimer&#xb4;s Disease (AD) hippocampus brain sections and in brains of APP Swedish PS1 dE9 (APP-PS1) mice, a transgenic model for Alzheimer&#xb4;s Disease (AD) pathology. The 5-Lipoxygenase&#xa0;(5-Lox) activating protein (FLAP), which anchors&#xa0;5-Lipoxygenase (5-Lox) to the membrane and mediates the contact to the substrate arachidonic acid, was confined exclusively to microglia with the entire microglia population expressing 5-Lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP). To define the contribution of microglia in the Leukotriene (LT) biosynthesis pathway, we ablated microglia using the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor PLX5622 in wildtype (WT) and APP-PS1 mice. Microglia ablation not only diminished the expression of FLAP and of the&#xa0;Leukotriene (LT) receptor Cysteinylleukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1), as expected based on their microglia cell type-specific expression, but also drastically reduced 5-Lipoxygenase (5-Lox) mRNA expression in the brain and its protein expression in neurons, in particular in wildtype (WT) mice. In conclusion i) microglia are key in Leukotriene (LT) biosynthesis, and ii) they regulate neuronal 5-Lipoxygenase (5-Lox) expression implying a yet unknown signaling mechanism between neurons and microglia."
"Tissue accumulation of abnormal aggregates of amyloidogenic proteins such as prion protein, &#x3b1;-synuclein, and tau represents the hallmark of most common neurodegenerative disorders and precedes the onset of symptoms by years. As a&#xa0;consequence, the sensitive and specific detection of abnormal forms of these proteins in patients' accessible tissues or fluids as biomarkers may have a significant impact on the clinical diagnosis of these disorders. By exploiting seeded polymerization propagation mechanisms to obtain cell-free reactions that allow highly amplified detection of these amyloid proteins, novel emerging in vitro techniques, such as the real-time quaking-induced conversion assay (RT-QuIC) have paved the way towards this important goal. Given its high accuracy in identifying misfolded forms of prion protein from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) CSF, RT-QuIC has already been included in the diagnostic criteria for the clinical diagnosis of sporadic CJD, the most common human prion disease. By showing that this assay may also accurately discriminate between Lewy body disorders and other forms of parkinsonisms or dementias, more recent studies strongly suggested that CSF RT-QuIC can also be successfully applied to synucleinopathies. Finally, preliminary encouraging data also suggested that CSF RT-QuIC might also work for tau protein, and accurately distinguish between 3R- and 4R tauopathies, including Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. Here we will review the state of the art of cell-free aggregation assays, their current diagnostic value and putative limitations, and the future perspectives for their expanded use in clinical practice."
"Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are aggressive pediatric brain tumors with dismal prognosis due to therapy-resistant tumor growth and invasion. We performed the first integrated histologic/genomic/proteomic analysis of 21 foci from three pontine DMG cases with supratentorial dissemination. Histone H3.3-K27M was the driver mutation, usually at high variant allele fraction due to recurrent chromosome 1q copy number gain, in combination with germline variants in ATM, FANCM and MYCN genes. Both previously reported and novel recurrent copy number variations and somatic pathogenic mutations in chromatin remodeling, DNA damage response and PI3K/MAPK growth pathways were variably detected, either in multiple or isolated foci. Proteomic analysis showed global upregulation of histone H3, lack of H3-K27 trimethylation, and further impairment of polycomb repressive complex 2 by ASXL1 downregulation. Activation of oncogenic pathways resulted from combined upregulation of N-MYC, SOX2, p65/p50 NF-&#x3ba;B and STAT3 transcription factors, EGFR, FGFR2, PDGFR&#x3b1;/&#x3b2; receptor tyrosine kinases, and downregulation of PHLPP1/2, PTEN and p16/INK4A tumor suppressors. Upregulation of SMAD4, PAI-1, CD44, and c-SRC in multiple foci most likely contributed to invasiveness. This integrated comprehensive analysis revealed a complex spatiotemporal evolution in diffuse intrisic pontine glioma, recommending pontine and cerebellar biopsies for accurate populational genetic characterization, and delineated common signaling pathways and potential therapeutic targets. It also revealed an unsuspected activation of a multitude of oncogenic pathways, including cancer cell reprogramming, explaining the resistance of DMG to current therapies."
"Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors, but treatment options for meningioma patients are limited due to incomplete understanding of tumor biology. A small percentage of meningiomas harbor somatic variants in the Hedgehog pathway, a conserved gene expression program that is essential for development and adult stem cell homeostasis. Hedgehog signals are transduced through primary cilia, and misactivation of the Hedgehog pathway is known to underlie cancer. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of Hedgehog signaling in meningioma are unknown. Here, we investigate mechanisms of ciliary Hedgehog signaling in meningioma using tissue microarrays containing 154 human meningioma samples, NanoString transcriptional profiling, primary meningioma cells, pharmacology, and CRISPR interference. Our results reveal that meningiomas of all grades can express primary cilia, but that cilia are less prevalent among anaplastic tumors. Moreover, we find that expression of Smoothened alleles that are oncogenic in other contexts fail to activate the Hedgehog transcriptional program or promote proliferation in primary meningioma cells. These data reveal that meningiomas can express the subcellular structure necessary for canonical Hedgehog signaling, but suggest that they do not transduce ciliary Hedgehog signals."
"Inflammatory orbital lesions include a broad list of diagnoses, many of them with overlapping clinical and radiographic features. They often present a diagnostic conundrum, even to the most experienced orbital specialist, thus placing considerable weight on surgical biopsy and histopathological analysis. However, histopathological diagnosis is also inherently challenging due to the rarity of these lesions and the overlaps in histologic appearance among distinct disease entities. We herein present the case of an adolescent male with a subacutely progressive orbital mass that generated a significant diagnostic dilemma. Early orbital biopsy was consistent with a benign fibro-inflammatory lesion, but corticosteroid therapy was ineffective in halting disease progression. After an initial substantial surgical debulking, histopathological analysis revealed several key features consistent with IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), a systemic fibro-inflammatory process typically accompanied by multifocal tumor-like lesions. Surprisingly, within months, there was clear evidence of clinical and radiographic disease progression despite second-line rituximab treatment, prompting a second surgical debulking. This final specimen displayed distinctive features of Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD), a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by uncontrolled histiocytic proliferation. Interestingly, certain features of this re-excision specimen were still reminiscent of IgG4-RD, which not only reflects the difficulty in differentiating RDD from IgG4-RD in select cases, but also illustrates that these diagnoses may exist along a spectrum that likely reflects a common underlying pathogenetic mechanism. This case emphasizes the importance of surgical biopsy or resection and histopathological analysis in diagnosing-and, ultimately, treating-rare, systemic inflammatory diseases involving the orbit, and, furthermore, highlights the shared histopathological features between RDD and IgG4-RD."
"In the brains of tauopathy patients, tau pathology coincides with the presence of granulovacuolar degeneration bodies (GVBs) both at the regional and cellular level. Recently, it was shown that intracellular tau pathology causes GVB formation in experimental models thus explaining the strong correlation between these neuropathological hallmarks in the human brain. These novel models of GVB formation provide opportunities for future research into GVB biology, but also urge reevaluation of previous post-mortem observations. Here, we review neuropathological data on GVBs in tauopathies and other neurodegenerative proteinopathies. We discuss the possibility that intracellular aggregates composed of proteins other than tau are also able to induce GVB formation. Furthermore, the potential mechanisms of GVB formation and the downstream functional implications hereof are outlined in view of the current available data. In addition, we provide guidelines for the identification of GVBs in tissue and cell models that will help to facilitate and streamline research towards the elucidation of the role of these enigmatic and understudied structures in neurodegeneration."
"A case of a true dual-genotype IDH-mutant oligoastrocytoma with two different cell types within a single mass in a young woman is presented. Imaging findings of the left frontal infiltrating glioma predicted the two neoplastic components that were identified upon resection. Tissue examination demonstrated areas of tumor with contrasting histologic and molecular features, including specific IDH1, ATRX, TP53, TERT and CIC mutational profiles, consistent with oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma, respectively. The clinical and radiological course over 17&#x2009;months from first diagnosis included three surgical resections with slow progression of the astrocytic component, and ultimately chemotherapy and radiation treatments were commenced. Reports of the clinical courses for these rare cases of dual-genotype oligoastrocytomas will inform therapy choices, to optimize benefit while minimizing side effects. The steadily increasing number of cases suggests that the neoplasm might be reconsidered as an official entity by the WHO."
"Recent updates in the classification of central nervous system (CNS) tumors have increased the need for molecular testing. Assessment of multiple alterations in parallel, complex combinations of gene sequence and chromosomal changes, as well as therapy prediction by identification of actionable mutations are the major challenges. We here report on a customized next generation sequencing (NGS)-based DNA panel assay that combines diagnostic and predictive testing and -as a comprehensive approach- allows for simultaneous single nucleotide variant (SNP) / small insertion/deletion (InDel), copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) detection. We analyzed formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) DNA from a total of 104 patients with CNS tumors. After amplicon capture-based library preparation, sequencing was performed on the relatively cost-efficient Illiumina MiniSeq platform and evaluated with freely available bioinformatical tools. 57 genes for exonic SNP/InDel calling (19 of those in intronic regions for CNV analysis), 3 chromosomal arms and 4 entire chromosomes for CNV and LOH analysis were covered. Results were extensively validated. Our approach yielded high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. It led to refined diagnoses in a relevant number of analyzed cases, reliably enabled complex subclassifications (e.g. for medulloblastomas) and identified actionable targets for clinical use. Thus, our single-platform approach is an efficient and powerful tool to comprehensively support molecular testing in neurooncology. Future functionality is guaranteed as novel upcoming biomarkers can be easily incorporated in a modular panel design."
"An intronic hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 causes familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This repeat is thought to elicit toxicity through RNA mediated protein sequestration and repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation of dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). We generated a series of transgenic Drosophila models expressing GGGGCC (G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub>) repeats either inside of an artificial intron within a GFP reporter or within the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of GFP placed in different downstream reading frames. Expression of 484 intronic repeats elicited minimal alterations in eye morphology, viability, longevity, or larval crawling but did trigger RNA foci formation, consistent with prior reports. In contrast, insertion of repeats into the 5' UTR elicited differential toxicity that was dependent on the reading frame of GFP relative to the repeat. Greater toxicity correlated with a short and unstructured carboxyl terminus (C-terminus) in the glycine-arginine (GR) RAN protein reading frame. This change in C-terminal sequence triggered nuclear accumulation of all three RAN DPRs. A similar differential toxicity and dependence on the GR C-terminus was observed when repeats were expressed in rodent neurons. The presence of the native C-termini across all three reading frames was partly protective. Taken together, these findings suggest that C-terminal sequences outside of the repeat region may alter the behavior and toxicity of dipeptide repeat proteins derived from GGGGCC repeats."
"With evidence supporting the prion-like spreading of extracellular tau as a mechanism for the initiation and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), immunotherapy has emerged as a potential disease-modifying strategy to target tau. Many studies have proven effective to clear pathological tau species in animal models of AD, and several clinical trials using conventional immunotherapy with anti-tau native antibodies are currently active. We have previously generated a vectorized scFv derived from the conformation-dependent anti-tau antibody MC1, scFvMC1, and demonstrated that its intracranial injection was able to prevent tau pathology in adult tau mice. Here, we show that, in a prevention paradigm and in two different tau transgenic models (JNPL3 and P301S), a one-time intramuscular injection of AAV1-scFvMC1 generated a long-lasting peripheral source of anti-tau scFvMC1 and significantly reduced insoluble and soluble tau species in the brain. Moreover, our data showed that scFvMC1 was internalized by the microglia, in the absence of overt inflammation. This study demonstrates the efficacy of intramuscular delivery of vectorized scFv to target tau, and suggests a new potential application to treat AD and the other tauopathies."
"Sandhoff disease (SD) is a lysosomal storage disease, caused by loss of &#x3b2;-hexosaminidase (HEX) activity resulting in the accumulation of ganglioside GM2. There are shared features between SD and Parkinson's disease (PD). &#x3b1;-synuclein (aSYN) inclusions, the diagnostic hallmark sign of PD, are frequently found in the brain in SD patients and HEX knockout mice, and HEX activity is reduced in the substantia nigra in PD. In this study, we biochemically demonstrate that HEX deficiency in mice causes formation of high-molecular weight (HMW) aSYN and ubiquitin in the brain. As expected from HEX enzymatic function requirements, overexpression in vivo of HEXA and B combined, but not either of the subunits expressed alone, increased HEX activity as evidenced by histochemical assays. Biochemically, such HEX gene expression resulted in increased conversion of GM2 to its breakdown product GM3. In a neurodegenerative model of overexpression of aSYN in rats, increasing HEX activity by AAV6 gene transfer in the substantia nigra reduced aSYN embedding in lipid compartments and rescued dopaminergic neurons from degeneration. Overall, these data are consistent with a paradigm shift where lipid abnormalities are central to or preceding protein changes typically associated with PD."

White matter hyperintensities (WMH) occur in association with dementia but the aetiology is unclear. Here we test the hypothesis that there is a combination of impaired elimination of interstitial fluid from the white matter together with a degree of hypoxia in WMH. One of the mechanisms for the elimination of amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) from the brain is along the basement membranes in the walls of capillaries and arteries (Intramural Peri-Arterial Drainage - IPAD). We compared the dynamics of IPAD in the grey matter of the hippocampus and in the white matter of the corpus callosum in 10&#x2009;week old C57/B16 mice by injecting soluble A&#x3b2; as a tracer. The dynamics of IPAD in the white matter were significantly slower compared with the grey matter and this was associated with a lower density of capillaries in the white matter. Exposing cultures of smooth muscle cells to hypercapnia as a model of cerebral hypoperfusion resulted in a reduction in fibronectin and an increase in laminin in the extracellular matrix. Similar changes were detected in the white matter in human WMH suggesting that hypercapnia/hypoxia may play a role in WMH. Employing therapies to enhance both IPAD and blood flow in the white matter may reduce WMH in patients with dementia.
"Myeloid cells contribute to inflammation and demyelination in the early stages of multiple sclerosis (MS), but it is still unclear to what extent these cells are involved in active lesion formation in progressive MS (PMS). Here, we have harnessed the power of single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to compare myeloid cell phenotypes in active lesions of PMS donors with those in normal-appearing white matter from the same donors and control white matter from non-MS donors. CyTOF measurements of a total of 74 targeted proteins revealed a decreased abundance of homeostatic and TNF<sup>hi</sup> microglia, and an increase in highly phagocytic and activated microglia states in active lesions of PMS donors. Interestingly, in contrast to results obtained from studies of the inflammatory early disease stages of MS, infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages were scarce in active lesions of PMS, suggesting fundamental differences of myeloid cell composition in advanced stages of PMS."
"Progressive multi-focal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a potentially fatal encephalitis caused by JC polyomavirus (JCV). PML principally affects people with a compromised immune system, such as patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) receiving treatment with natalizumab. However, intrathecal synthesis of lipid-reactive IgM in MS patients is associated with a markedly lower incidence of natalizumab-associated PML compared to those without this antibody repertoire. Here we demonstrate that a subset of lipid-reactive human and murine IgMs induce a functional anti-viral response that inhibits replication of encephalitic Alpha and Orthobunyaviruses in multi-cellular central nervous system cultures. These lipid-specific IgMs trigger microglia to produce IFN-&#x3b2; in a cGAS-STING-dependent manner, which induces an IFN-&#x3b1;/&#x3b2;-receptor 1-dependent antiviral response in glia and neurons. These data identify lipid-reactive IgM as a mediator of anti-viral activity in the nervous system and provide a rational explanation why intrathecal synthesis of lipid-reactive IgM correlates with a reduced incidence of iatrogenic PML in MS."
"The transcription factor, p53, is critical for many important cellular functions involved in genome integrity, including cell cycle control, DNA damage response, and apoptosis. Disruption of p53 results in a wide range of disorders including cancer, metabolic diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by protein aggregates that contribute to disease pathology. Although p53 is known to aggregate, its propensity to aggregate in AD has never been assessed. Moreover, AD neuropathology includes lethal cell cycle re-entry, excessive DNA damage, and abnormal cell death which are all controlled by p53. Here, we show p53 forms oligomers and fibrils in human AD brain, but not control brain. p53 oligomers can also be detected in htau and P301L mouse models. Additionally, we demonstrate that p53 interacts with tau, specifically tau oligomers, in AD brain and can be recapitulated by in vitro exogenous tau oligomer treatment in C57BL/6 primary neurons. p53 oligomers also colocalize, potentially seeding, endogenous p53 in primary neurons. Lastly, we demonstrate that in the presence of DNA damage, phosphorylated p53 is mislocalized outside the nucleus and p53-mediated DNA damage responders are significantly decreased in AD brain. Control brain shows a healthy DNA damage response, indicating a loss of nuclear p53 function in AD may be due to p53 aggregation and/or interactions with tau oligomers. Given the critical role of p53 in cellular physiology, the disruption of this crucial transcription factor may set an irreversible course towards neurodegeneration in AD and potentially other tauopathies, warranting further investigation."
"Molecular chaperones and co-chaperones, which are part of the protein quality control machinery, have been shown to regulate distinct aspects of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology in multiple ways. Notably, the co-chaperone STI1, which presents increased levels in AD, can protect mammalian neurons from amyloid-&#x3b2; toxicity in vitro and reduced STI1 levels worsen A&#x3b2; toxicity in C. elegans. However, whether increased STI1 levels can protect neurons in vivo remains unknown. We determined that overexpression of STI1 and/or Hsp90 protected C. elegans expressing A&#x3b2;<sub>(3-42)</sub> against A&#x3b2;-mediated paralysis. Mammalian neurons were also protected by elevated levels of endogenous STI1 in vitro, and this effect was mainly due to extracellular STI1. Surprisingly, in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, by overexpressing STI1, we find increased amyloid burden, which amplifies neurotoxicity and worsens spatial memory deficits in these mutants. Increased levels of STI1 disturbed the expression of A&#x3b2;-regulating enzymes (BACE1 and MMP-2), suggesting potential mechanisms by which amyloid burden is increased in mice. Notably, we observed that STI1 accumulates in dense-core AD plaques in both 5xFAD mice and human brain tissue. Our findings suggest that elevated levels of STI1 contribute to A&#x3b2; accumulation, and that STI1 is deposited in AD plaques in mice and humans. We conclude that despite the protective effects of STI1 in C. elegans and in mammalian cultured neurons, in vivo, the predominant effect of elevated STI1 is deleterious in AD."
"Microangiopathy, including proliferation of small diameter capillaries, increasing vessel tortuosity, and increased capillary blockage by leukocytes, was previously observed in the aged rTg4510 mouse model. Similar gene expression changes related to angiogenesis were observed in both rTg4510 and Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is uncertain if tau is directly responsible for these vascular changes by interacting directly with microvessels, and/or if it contributes indirectly via neurodegeneration and concurrent neuronal loss and inflammation. To better understand the nature of tau-related microangiopathy in human AD and in tau mice, we isolated capillaries and observed that bioactive soluble tau protein could be readily detected in association with vasculature. To examine whether this soluble tau is directly responsible for the microangiopathic changes, we made use of the tetracycline-repressible gene expression cassette in the rTg4510 mouse model and measured vascular pathology following tau reduction. These data suggest that reduction of tau is insufficient to alter established microvascular complications including morphological alterations, enhanced expression of inflammatory genes involved in leukocyte adherence, and blood brain barrier compromise. These data imply that 1) soluble bioactive tau surprisingly accumulates at the blood brain barrier in human brain and in mouse models, and 2) the morphological and molecular phenotype of microvascular disturbance does not resolve with reduction of whole brain soluble tau. Additional consideration of vascular-directed therapies and strategies that target tau in the vascular space may be required to restore normal function in neurodegenerative disease."
"Down syndrome (DS) occurs with triplication of human chromosome 21 and is associated with deviations in cortical development evidenced by simplified gyral appearance and reduced cortical surface area. Radial glia are neuronal and glial progenitors that also create a scaffolding structure essential for migrating neurons to reach cortical targets and therefore play a critical role in cortical development. The aim of this study was to characterise radial glial expression pattern and morphology in the frontal lobe of the developing human fetal brain with DS and age-matched controls. Secondly, we investigated whether microstructural information from in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could reflect histological findings from human brain tissue samples. Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded human post-mortem brain tissue from nine fetuses and neonates with DS (15-39 gestational weeks (GW)) and nine euploid age-matched brains (18-39 GW). Radial glia markers CRYAB, HOPX, SOX2, GFAP and Vimentin were assessed in the Ventricular Zone, Subventricular Zone and Intermediate Zone. In vivo diffusion MRI was used to assess microstructure in these regions in one DS (21 GW) and one control (22 GW) fetal brain. We found a significant reduction in radial glial progenitor SOX2 and subtle deviations in radial glia expression (GFAP and Vimentin) prior to 24 GW in DS. In vivo, fetal MRI demonstrates underlying radial projections consistent with immunohistopathology. Radial glial alterations may contribute to the subsequent simplified gyral patterns and decreased cortical volumes observed in the DS brain. Recent advances in fetal MRI acquisition and analysis could provide non-invasive imaging-based biomarkers of early developmental deviations."
"Ovine congenital progressive muscular dystrophy (OCPMD) was first described in Merino sheep flocks in Queensland and Western Australia in the 1960s and 1970s. The most prominent feature of the disease is a distinctive gait with stiffness of the hind limbs that can be seen as early as 3&#xa0;weeks after birth. The disease is progressive. Histopathological examination had revealed dystrophic changes specifically in type I (slow) myofibres, while electron microscopy had demonstrated abundant nemaline bodies. Therefore, it was never certain whether the disease was a dystrophy or a congenital myopathy with dystrophic features. In this study, we performed whole genome sequencing of OCPMD sheep and identified a single base deletion at the splice donor site (+&#x2009;1) of intron 13 in the type I myofibre-specific TNNT1 gene (KT218690 c.614&#x2009;+&#x2009;1delG). All affected sheep were homozygous for this variant. Examination of TNNT1 splicing by RT-PCR showed intron retention and premature termination, which disrupts the highly conserved 14 amino acid C-terminus. The variant did not reduce TNNT1 protein levels or affect its localization but impaired its ability to modulate muscle contraction in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Identification of the causative variant in TNNT1 finally clarifies that the OCPMD sheep is in fact a large animal model of TNNT1 congenital myopathy. This model could now be used for testing molecular or gene therapies."
"Despite the considerable progress made towards understanding ALS pathophysiology, several key features of ALS remain unexplained, from its aetiology to its epidemiological aspects. The glymphatic system, which has recently been recognised as a major clearance pathway for the brain, has received considerable attention in several neurological conditions, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Its significance in ALS has, however, been little addressed. This perspective article therefore aims to assess the possibility of CSF contribution in ALS by considering various lines of evidence, including the abnormal composition of ALS-CSF, its toxicity and the evidence for impaired CSF dynamics in ALS patients. We also describe a potential role for CSF circulation in determining disease spread as well as the importance of CSF dynamics in ALS neurotherapeutics. We propose that a CSF model could potentially offer additional avenues to explore currently unexplained features of ALS, ultimately leading to new treatment options for&#xa0;people with ALS."
"Both monogenic diseases and viral infections can manifest in a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes that range from asymptomatic to lethal, suggesting that other factors modulate disease severity. Here, we examine the interplay between the genetic neuronopathic Gaucher's disease (nGD), and neuroinvasive Sindbis virus (SVNI) infection. Infection of nGD mice with SVNI had no influence on nGD severity. However, nGD mice were more resistant to SVNI infection. Significantly different inflammatory responses were seen in nGD brains when compared with SVNI brains: the inflammatory response in the nGD brains consisted of reactive astrocytes and microglia with no infiltrating macrophages, but the inflammatory response in the brains of SVNI-infected mice was characterized by infiltration of macrophages and altered activation of microglia and astrocytes. We suggest that the innate immune response activated in nGD confers resistance against viral infection of the CNS."
"We present a case of a 14-year old boy with tumor-associated refractory epilepsy. Positron emission tomography imaging demonstrated a region with heterogeneous high <sup>11</sup>C-methionine uptake and a region with homogenous low <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake within the tumor. Histopathological and genomic analyses confirmed the tumor as BRAF V600E-mutated polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumor of the young (PLNTY). Within the high-methionine-uptake region, we observed increased protein levels of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), a major transporter of methionine; c-Myc; and constituents of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We also found that LAT1 expression was linked to the BRAF V600E mutation and subsequent activation of MAPK signaling and c-Myc. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the MAPK pathway suppressed c-Myc and LAT1 expression in BRAF V600E-mutated PLNTY and glioblastoma cells. The BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib moderately suppressed cell viability in PLNTY. Collectively, our results indicate that BRAF V600E mutation-activated MAPK signaling and downstream c-Myc induces specific metabolic alterations in PLNTY, and may represent an attractive target in the treatment of the disease."
"We document the neuropathologic findings of a 73-year old man who died from acute cerebellar hemorrhage in the context of relatively mild SARS-CoV2 infection. The patient developed sudden onset of headache, nausea, and vomiting, immediately followed by loss of consciousness on the day of admission. Emergency medical services found him severely hypoxemic at home, and the patient suffered a cardiac arrest during transport to the emergency department. The emergency team achieved return of spontaneous circulation after over 17&#xa0;min of resuscitation. A chest radiograph revealed hazy bilateral opacities; and real-time-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on the nasopharyngeal swab was positive. Computed tomography of the head showed a large right cerebellar hemorrhage, with tonsillar herniation and intraventricular hemorrhage. One day after presentation, he was transitioned to comfort care and died shortly after palliative extubation. Autopsy performed 3&#xa0;h after death showed cerebellar hemorrhage and acute infarcts in the dorsal pons and medulla. Remarkably, there were microglial nodules and neuronophagia bilaterally in the inferior olives and multifocally in the cerebellar dentate nuclei. This constellation of findings has not been reported thus far in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
"We describe an autopsied patient with familial parkinsonism and unclassified four repeat-tau (4R-tau) aggregation. She presented with bradykinesia, truncal dystonia, and mild amnesia at the age of 61 and then exhibited body weight loss (15&#xa0;kg over 8&#xa0;months), sleep disturbances, and progressive respiratory failure with CO<sub>2</sub> narcosis. She died of respiratory failure at the age of 62, 14&#xa0;months after disease onset. Her brother also showed parkinsonism at the age of 58 and suddenly died 6&#xa0;months later. Postmortem examination revealed 4R-tau aggregation, which was characterized by neuronal globose-type tangles or pretangles, bush-like or miscellaneous astrocytic inclusions, and coiled bodies. The temporal tip, the striatum, the substantia nigra, the tegmentum of the midbrain, the medullary reticular formation, and the spinal cord were severely involved with tau aggregation. Argyrophilic grains and ballooned neurons were also found in the medial temporal structures, however, extensions of the 4R-aggregations in the case were clearly broader than those of the argyrophilic grains. Western blot analysis of sarkosyl-insoluble fractions from brain lysates revealed prominent bands of tau at both 33&#xa0;kDa and 37&#xa0;kDa. Genetic examinations did not reveal any known pathogenic mutations in MAPT, DCTN-1, PSEN-1, or familial or young-onset parkinsonism-related genes. The clinical manifestations, pathologic findings, and biochemical properties of aggregated tau in our patient cannot be explained by argyrophilic grain disease or other known 4R-tauopathies alone. Our results further extend the clinical and neuropathologic spectra of 4R-tauopathy."
"It is necessary to develop an understanding of the specific mechanisms involved in alpha-synuclein aggregation and propagation to develop disease modifying therapies for age-related synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies. To adequately address this question, we developed a new transgenic mouse model of synucleinopathy that expresses human A53T SynGFP under control of the mouse prion protein promoter. Our characterization of this mouse line demonstrates that it exhibits several distinct advantages over other, currently available, mouse models. This new model allows rigorous study of the initial location of Lewy pathology formation and propagation in the living brain, and strongly suggests that aggregation begins in axonal structures with retrograde propagation to the cell body. This model also shows expeditious development of alpha-synuclein pathology following induction with small, in vitro-generated alpha-synuclein pre-formed fibrils (PFFs), as well as accelerated cell death of inclusion-bearing cells. Using this model, we found that aggregated alpha-synuclein somatic inclusions developed first in neurons, but later showed a second wave of inclusion formation in astrocytes. Interestingly, astrocytes appear to survive much longer after inclusion formation than their neuronal counterparts. This model also allowed careful study of peripheral-to-central spread of Lewy pathology after PFF injection into the hind limb musculature. Our results clearly show evidence of progressive, retrograde trans-synaptic spread of Lewy pathology through known neuroanatomically connected pathways in the motor system. As such, we have developed a promising tool to understand the biology of neurodegeneration associated with alpha-synuclein aggregation and to discover new treatments capable of altering the neurodegenerative disease course of synucleinopathies."
"A large intronic hexanucleotide repeat expansion (GGGGCC) within the C9orf72 (C9orf72-SMCR8 Complex Subunit) locus is the most prevalent genetic cause of both Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Motor Neuron Disease (MND). In patients this expansion is typically hundreds to thousands of repeat units in length. Repeat associated non-AUG translation of the expansion leads to the formation of toxic, pathological Dipeptide-Repeat Proteins (DPRs). To date there remains a lack of in vivo models expressing C9orf72 related DPRs with a repeat length of more than a few hundred repeats. As such our understanding of how physiologically relevant repeat length DPRs effect the nervous system in an ageing in vivo system remains limited. In this study we generated Drosophila models expressing DPRs over 1000 repeat units in length, a known pathological length in humans. Using these models, we demonstrate each DPR exhibits a unique, age-dependent, phenotypic and pathological profile. Furthermore, we show co-expression of specific DPR combinations leads to distinct, age-dependent, phenotypes not observed through expression of single DPRs. We propose these models represent a unique, in vivo, tool for dissecting the molecular mechanisms implicated in disease pathology, opening up new avenues in the study of both MND and FTD."
"Melanoma brain metastases (MBM) portend a grim prognosis and can occur in up to 40% of melanoma patients. Genomic characterization of brain metastases has been previously carried out to identify potential mutational drivers. However, to date a comprehensive multi-omics approach has yet to be used to analyze brain metastases. In this case report, we present an unbiased proteogenomics analyses of a patient's primary skin cancer and three brain metastases from distinct anatomic locations. We performed molecular profiling comprised of a targeted DNA panel and full transcriptome as well as proteomics using mass spectrometry. Phylogeny demonstrated that all MBMs shared a SMARCA4 mutation and deletion of 12q. Proteogenomics identified multiple pathways upregulated in the MBMs compared to the primary tumor. The protein, PIK3CG, was present in many of these pathways and had increased gene expression in metastatic melanoma tissue from the cancer genome atlas data. Proteomics demonstrated PIK3CG levels were significantly increased in all 3 MBMs and this finding was further validated by immunohistochemistry. In summary, this case report highlights the potential role of proteogenomics in identifying pathways involved in metastatic tumor progression. Furthermore, our multi-omics approach can be considered to aid in precision oncology efforts and provide avenues for therapeutic innovation."
"Hexanucleotide repeat expansion of C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Synergies between loss of C9ORF72 functions and gain of toxicities from the repeat expansions contribute to C9ORF72-mediated pathogenesis. However, how loss of C9orf72 impacts neuronal and synaptic functions remains undetermined. Here, we showed that long-term potentiation at the dentate granule cells and long-term depression at the Schaffer collateral/commissural synapses at the area CA1 were reduced in the hippocampus of C9orf72 knockout mice. Using unbiased transcriptomic analysis, we identified that Klotho, a longevity gene, was selectively dysregulated in an age-dependent manner. Specifically, Klotho protein expression in the hippocampus of C9orf72 knockout mice was incorrectly enriched in the dendritic regions of CA1 with concomitant reduction in granule cell layer of dentate gyrus at 3-month of age followed by an accelerating decline during aging. Furthermore, adult hippocampal neurogenesis was reduced in C9orf72 knockout mice. Taken together, our data suggest that C9ORF72 is required for synaptic plasticity and adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus and Klotho deregulations may be part of C9ORF72-mediated toxicity."
"Microglia are the primary immune-competent cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and sense both pathogen- and host-derived factors through several receptor systems including the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family. Although TLR5 has previously been implicated in different CNS disorders including neurodegenerative diseases, its mode of action in the brain remained largely unexplored. We sought to determine the expression and functional consequences of TLR5 activation in the CNS. Quantitative real-time PCR and immunocytochemical analysis revealed that microglia is the major CNS cell type that constitutively expresses TLR5. Using Tlr5<sup>-/-</sup> mice and inhibitory TLR5 antibody we found that activation of TLR5 in microglial cells by its agonist flagellin, a principal protein component of bacterial flagella, triggers their release of distinct inflammatory molecules, regulates chemotaxis, and increases their phagocytic activity. Furthermore, while TLR5 activation does not affect tumor growth in an ex vivo GL261 glioma mouse model, it triggers microglial accumulation and neuronal apoptosis in the cerebral cortex in vivo. TLR5-mediated microglial function involves the PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway, as specific inhibitors of this signaling pathway abolish microglial activation. Taken together, our findings establish TLR5 as a modulator of microglial function and indicate its contribution to inflammatory and injurious processes in the CNS."
"Increasing evidence suggests that propagation of the motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) involves the pathogenic aggregation of disease-associated proteins that spread in a prion-like manner. We have identified two aggregate strains of human superoxide dismutase 1 (hSOD1) that arise in the CNS of transgenic mouse models of SOD1-mediated ALS. Both strains transmit template-directed aggregation and premature fatal paralysis when inoculated into the spinal cord of adult hSOD1 transgenic mice. This spread of pathogenic aggregation could be a potential target for immunotherapeutic intervention. Here we generated mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed to exposed epitopes in hSOD1 aggregate strains and identified an aggregate selective mAb that targets the aa 143-153 C-terminal extremity of hSOD1 (&#x3b1;SOD1<sup>143-153</sup>). Both pre-incubation of seeds with &#x3b1;SOD1<sup>143-153</sup> prior to inoculation, and weekly intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration attenuated transmission of pathogenic aggregation and prolonged the survival of seed-inoculated hSOD1<sup>G85R</sup> Tg mice. In contrast, administration of a mAb targeting aa 65-72 (&#x3b1;SOD1<sup>65-72</sup>), which exhibits high affinity towards monomeric disordered hSOD1, had an adverse effect and aggravated seed induced premature ALS-like disease. Although the mAbs reached similar concentrations in CSF, only &#x3b1;SOD1<sup>143-153</sup> was found in association with aggregated hSOD1 in spinal cord homogenates. Our results suggest that an aggregate-selective immunotherapeutic approach may suppress seeded transmission of pathogenic aggregation in ALS. However, long-term administration of &#x3b1;SOD1<sup>143-153</sup> was unable to prolong the lifespan of non-inoculated hSOD1<sup>G85R</sup> Tg mice. Thus, spontaneously initiated hSOD1 aggregation in spinal motor neurons may be poorly accessible to therapeutic antibodies."
"In the clinical diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies, distinction from Alzheimer's disease is suboptimal and complicated by shared genetic risk factors and frequent co-pathology. In the present study we tested the ability of polygenic scores for Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson's disease to differentiate individuals in a 2713-participant, pathologically defined sample. A dementia with Lewy bodies polygenic score that excluded apolipoprotein E due to its overlap with Alzheimer's disease risk was specifically associated with at least limbic (transitional) Lewy-related pathology and a pathological diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies. An Alzheimer's disease polygenic score was associated with neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles but not Lewy-related pathology, and was most strongly associated with an Alzheimer's pathological diagnosis. Our results indicate that an assessment of genetic risk may be useful to clinically distinguish between Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Notably, we found no association with a Parkinson's disease polygenic score, which aligns with evidence that dementia with Lewy bodies has a distinct genetic signature that can be exploited to improve clinical diagnoses."
"In tauopathies, phosphorylation, acetylation, cleavage and other modifications of tau drive intracellular generation of diverse forms of toxic tau aggregates and associated seeding activity, which have been implicated in subsequent synaptic failure and neurodegeneration. Suppression of this wide range of pathogenic species, seeding and toxicity mechanisms, while preserving the physiological roles of tau, presents a key therapeutic goal. Identification and targeting of signaling networks that influence a broad spectrum of tau pathogenic mechanisms might prevent or reverse synaptic degeneration and modify disease outcomes. The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) modulates such networks, including activation of multiple tau kinases, calpain and rhoA-cofilin activity. The orally bioavailable small-molecule p75<sup>NTR</sup> modulator, LM11A-31, was administered to tau<sup>P301S</sup> mice for 3&#xa0;months starting at 6&#xa0;months of age, when tau pathology was well established. LM11A-31 was found to reduce: excess activation of hippocampal cdk5 and JNK kinases and calpain; excess cofilin phosphorylation, tau phosphorylation, acetylation and cleavage; accumulation of multiple forms of insoluble tau aggregates and filaments; and, microglial activation. Hippocampal extracts from treated mice had substantially reduced tau seeding activity. LM11A-31 treatment also led to a reversal of pyramidal neuron dendritic spine loss, decreased loss of dendritic complexity and improvement in performance of hippocampal behaviors. These studies identify a therapeutically tractable upstream signaling module regulating a wide spectrum of basic mechanisms underlying tauopathies."
"Mitochondrial health is important in ageing and dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) accelerates ageing and influences neurodegeneration. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) codes for vital OXPHOS subunits and mtDNA background has been associated with neurodegeneration; however, no study has characterised mtDNA variation in Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) or Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) risk or pathogenesis. In this case-control study, 910 (42.6% male) neurologically-healthy controls, 1042 (54.1% male) pathologically-confirmed PSP cases, and 171 (52.0% male) pathologically-confirmed CBD cases were assessed to determine how stable mtDNA polymorphisms, in the form of mtDNA haplogroups, were associated with risk of PSP, risk of CBD, age of PSP onset, PSP disease duration, and neuropathological tau pathology measures for neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), neuropil threads (NT), tufted astrocytes (TA), astrocytic plaques (AP), and oligodendroglial coiled bodies (CB). 764 PSP cases and 150 CBD cases had quantitative tau pathology scores. mtDNA was genotyped for 39 unique SNPs using Agena Bioscience iPlex technologies and mitochondrial haplogroups were defined to mitochondrial phylogeny. After adjustment for multiple testing, we observed an association with risk of CBD for mtDNA sub-haplogroup H4 (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.51, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001) and the HV/HV0a haplogroup was associated with a decreased severity of NT tau pathology in PSP cases (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0023). Our study reports that mitochondrial genomic background may be associated with risk of CBD and may be influencing tau pathology measures in PSP. Replication of these findings will be important."
"A C9orf72 repeat expansion is the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. One of the suggested pathomechanisms is toxicity from dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), which are generated via unconventional translation of sense and antisense repeat transcripts with poly-GA, poly-GP and poly-GR being the most abundant dipeptide proteins. Animal and cellular studies highlight a neurotoxic role of poly-GR and poly-PR and to a lesser degree of poly-GA. Human post-mortem studies in contrast have been much less clear on a potential role of DPR toxicity but have largely focused on immunohistochemical methods to detect aggregated DPR inclusions. This study uses protein fractionation and sensitive immunoassays to quantify not only insoluble but also soluble poly-GA, poly-GP and poly-GR concentrations in brain homogenates of FTD patients with C9orf72 mutation across four brain regions. We show that soluble DPRs are less abundant in clinically affected areas (i.e. frontal and temporal cortices). In contrast, the cerebellum not only shows the largest DPR load but also the highest relative DPR solubility. Finally, poly-GR levels and poly-GP solubility correlate with clinical severity. These findings provide the first cross-comparison of soluble and insoluble forms of all sense DPRs and shed light on the distribution and role of soluble DPRs in the etiopathogenesis of human C9orf72-FTD."
"Ependymoma is the third most common brain tumor in children, with well-described molecular characterization but poorly understood underlying germline risk factors. To investigate whether genetic predisposition to longer telomere length influences ependymoma risk, we utilized case-control data from three studies: a population-based pediatric and adolescent ependymoma case-control sample from California (153 cases, 696 controls), a hospital-based pediatric posterior fossa type A (EPN-PF-A) ependymoma case-control study from Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (83 cases, 332 controls), and a multicenter adult-onset ependymoma case-control dataset nested within the Glioma International Case-Control Consortium (GICC) (103 cases, 3287 controls). In the California case-control sample, a polygenic score for longer telomere length was significantly associated with increased risk of ependymoma diagnosed at ages 12-19 (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.0&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;10<sup>-3</sup>), but not with ependymoma in children under 12&#xa0;years of age (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.94). Mendelian randomization supported this observation, identifying a significant association between genetic predisposition to longer telomere length and increased risk of adolescent-onset ependymoma (OR<sub>PRS</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.67; 95% CI 1.18-2.37; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.97&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;10<sup>-3</sup>) and adult-onset ependymoma (P<sub>MR-Egger</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.042), but not with risk of ependymoma diagnosed before age 12 (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.12; 95% CI 0.94-1.34; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.21), nor with EPN-PF-A (P<sub>MR-Egger</sub>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.59). These findings complement emerging literature suggesting that augmented telomere maintenance is important in ependymoma pathogenesis and progression, and that longer telomere length is a risk factor for diverse nervous system malignancies."
"Missense mutations in UBQLN2 cause X-linked dominant inheritance of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD). UBQLN2 belongs to a family of four highly homologous proteins expressed in humans that play diverse roles in maintaining proteostasis, but whether one isoform can substitute for another is not known. Here, we tested whether overexpression of UBQLN1 can alleviate disease in the P497S UBQLN2 mouse model of ALS/FTD by crossing transgenic (Tg) mouse lines expressing the two proteins and characterizing the resulting genotypes using a battery of pathologic and behavioral tests. The pathologic findings revealed UBQLN1 overexpression dramatically reduced the burden of UBQLN2 inclusions, neuronal loss and disturbances in proteostasis in double Tg mice compared to single P497S Tg mice. The beneficial effects of UBQLN1 overexpression were primarily confirmed by behavioral improvements seen in rotarod performance and grip strength in male, but not female mice. Paradoxically, although UBQLN1 overexpression reduced pathologic signatures of disease in P497S Tg mice, female mice had larger percentage of body weight loss than males, and this correlated with a corresponding lack of behavioral improvements in the females. These findings lead us to speculate that methods to upregulate UBQLN1 expression may reduce pathogenicity caused by UBQLN2 mutations, but may also lead to gender-specific outcomes that will have to be carefully weighed with the therapeutic benefits of UBQLN1 upregulation."
"The lectin pathway (LP) of complement activation is believed to contribute to brain inflammation. The study aims to identify the key components of the LP contributing to TBI outcome as possible novel pharmacological targets. We compared the long-term neurological deficits and neuropathology of wild-type mice (WT) to that of mice carrying gene deletions of key LP components after experimental TBI. WT or MASP-2 (Masp2<sup>-/-</sup>), ficolin-A (Fcna<sup>-/-</sup>), CL-11 (Colec11<sup>-/-</sup>), MASP-1/3 (Masp1<sup>-/-</sup>), MBL-C (Mbl2<sup>-/-</sup>), MBL-A (Mbl1<sup>-/-</sup>) or MBL<sup>-/-</sup> (Mbl1<sup>-/-</sup>/Mbl2<sup>-/-</sup>) deficient male C57BL/6J mice were used. Mice underwent sham surgery or TBI by controlled cortical impact. The sensorimotor response was evaluated by neuroscore and beam walk tests weekly for 4&#xa0;weeks. To obtain a comparative analysis of the functional outcome each transgenic line was rated according to a health score calculated on sensorimotor performance. For selected genotypes, brains were harvested 6&#xa0;weeks after injury for histopathological analysis. MASP-2<sup>-/-</sup>, MBL<sup>-/-</sup> and FCN-A<sup>-/-</sup> mice had better outcome scores compared to WT. Of these, MASP-2<sup>-/-</sup> mice had the best recovery after TBI, showing reduced sensorimotor deficits (by 33% at 3&#xa0;weeks and by 36% at 4&#xa0;weeks). They also showed higher neuronal density in the lesioned cortex with a 31.5% increase compared to WT. Measurement of LP functional activity in plasma from MASP-2<sup>-/-</sup> mice revealed the absence of LP functional activity using a C4b deposition assay. The LP critically contributes to the post-traumatic inflammatory pathology following TBI with the highest degree of protection achieved through the absence of the LP key enzyme MASP-2, underlining a therapeutic utility of MASP-2 targeting in TBI."
"Repeated exposure to mild TBI (mTBI) has been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and other neurodegenerative diseases. Some pathological features typically observed in AD have been found in postmortem brains of TBI and CTE, hence treatments tested for AD have a potential to be effective against r-mTBI outcomes. Neuroinflammation may present a possible answer due to its central role both in acute brain injury and in chronic degenerative-like disorders. Our previous studies have shown that drug nilvadipine, acting as an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), is effective at reducing inflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid production in AD mouse models. To demonstrate the effect of nilvadipine in the absence of age-related variables, we introduced the same treatment to young r-mTBI mice. We further investigate therapeutic mechanisms of nilvadipine using its racemic properties. Both enantiomers, (+)-nilvadipine and (-)-nilvadipine, can lower SYK activity, whereas (+)-nilvadipine is also a potent L-type calcium channel blocker (CCB) and shown to be anti-hypertensive. All r-mTBI mice exhibited increased neuroinflammation and impaired cognitive performance and motor functions. Treatment with racemic nilvadipine mitigated the TBI-induced inflammatory response and significantly improved spatial memory, whereas (-)-enantiomer decreased microgliosis and improved spatial memory but failed to reduce the astroglial response to as much as the racemate. These results suggest the therapeutic potential of SYK inhibition that is enhanced when combined with the CCB effect, which indicate a therapeutic advantage of multi-action drugs for r-mTBI."
"Mutations in the DNAJB6 gene have been identified as rare causes of myofibrillar myopathies. However, the underlying pathophysiologica mechanisms remain elusive. DNAJB6 has two known isoforms, including the nuclear isoform DNAJB6a and the cytoplasmic isoform DNAJB6b, which was thought to be the pathogenic isoform. Here, we report a novel recessive mutation c.695_699del (p. Val 232 Gly fs*7) in the DNAJB6 gene, associated with an apparently recessively inherited late onset distal myofibrillar myopathy in a Chinese family. Notably, the novel mutation localizes to exon 9 and uniquely encodes DNAJB6a. We further identified that this mutation decreases the mRNA and protein levels of DNAJB6a and results in an age-dependent recessive toxic effect on skeletal muscle in knock-in mice. Moreover, the mutant DNAJB6a showed a dose-dependent anti-aggregation effect on polyglutamine-containing proteins in vitro. Taking together, these findings reveal the pathogenic role of DNAJB6a insufficiency in myofibrillar myopathies and expand upon the molecular spectrum of DNAJB6 mutations."
"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), microglia are affected by disease processes, but may also drive pathogenesis. AD pathology-associated microglial populations have been identified with single-cell RNA-Seq, but have not been validated in human brain tissue with anatomical context. Here, we quantified myeloid cell markers to identify changes in AD pathology-associated microglial populations. We performed fluorescent immunohistochemistry on normal (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8) and AD (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8) middle temporal gyri, co-labelling the pan-myeloid cell marker, Iba1, with one of 11 markers of interest (MOIs): CD45, HLA-DR, CD14, CD74, CD33, CD206, CD32, CD163, P2RY12, TMEM119, L-Ferritin. Novel image analyses quantified the single-cell abundance of Iba1 and each MOI. Each cell was gated into one Iba1-MOI population (Iba1<sup>low</sup> MOI<sup>high</sup>, Iba1<sup>high</sup> MOI<sup>high</sup>, or Iba1<sup>high</sup> MOI<sup>low</sup>) and the abundance of each population was compared between AD and control. Triple-labelling of L-Ferritin and Iba1 with a subset of MOIs was performed to investigate L-Ferritin-MOI co-expression on Iba1<sup>low</sup> cells. Iba1<sup>low</sup> MOI<sup>high</sup> myeloid cell populations delineated by MOIs CD45, HLA-DR, CD14, CD74, CD33, CD32, and L-Ferritin were increased in AD. Further investigation of the Iba1<sup>low</sup> MOI<sup>high</sup> populations revealed that their abundances correlated with tau, but not amyloid beta, load in AD. The Iba1<sup>low</sup> microglial population highly expressed L-Ferritin, reflecting microglial dysfunction. The L-Ferritin<sup>high</sup> CD74<sup>high</sup> HLA-DR<sup>high</sup> phenotype of the Iba1<sup>low</sup> population mirrors that of a human AD pathology-associated microglial subpopulation previously identified using single-cell RNA-Seq. Our high-throughput immunohistochemical data with anatomical context support the microglial dysfunction hypothesis of AD."
"X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a life-threatening skeletal muscle disease caused by mutations in the MTM1 gene. XLMTM fibres display a population of nuclei mispositioned in the centre. In the present study, we aimed to explore whether positioning and overall distribution of nuclei affects cellular organization and contractile function, thereby contributing to muscle weakness in this disease. We also assessed whether gene therapy alters nuclear arrangement and function. We used tissue from human patients and animal models, including XLMTM dogs that had received increasing doses of recombinant AAV8 vector restoring MTM1 expression (rAAV8-cMTM1). We then used single isolated muscle fibres to analyze nuclear organization and contractile function. In addition to the expected mislocalization of nuclei in the centre of muscle fibres, a novel form of nuclear mispositioning was observed: irregular spacing between those located at the fibre periphery, and an overall increased number of nuclei, leading to dramatically smaller and inconsistent myonuclear domains. Nuclear mislocalization was associated with decreases in global nuclear synthetic activity, contractile protein content and intrinsic myofilament force production. A contractile deficit originating at the myofilaments, rather than mechanical interference by centrally positioned nuclei, was supported by experiments in regenerated mouse muscle. Systemic administration of rAAV8-cMTM1 at doses higher than 2.5&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;10<sup>13&#xa0;</sup>vg&#xa0;kg<sup>-1</sup> allowed a full rescue of all these cellular defects in XLMTM dogs. Altogether, these findings identify previously unrecognized pathological mechanisms in human and animal XLMTM, associated with myonuclear defects and contractile filament function. These defects can be reversed by gene therapy restoring MTM1 expression in dogs with XLMTM."
"Recent studies suggest that misfolded tau molecules can be released, and taken up by adjacent neurons, propagating proteopathic seeds across neural systems. Yet critical to understanding whether tau propagation is relevant in pathophysiology of disease would be to learn if it alters neuronal properties. We utilized high resolution multi-color in situ hybridization technology, RNAScope, in a well-established tau transgenic animal, and found that a subset of neurons in the cortex do not appear to express the transgene, but do develop phospho-tau positive inclusions, consistent with having received tau seeds. Recipient neurons show decreases in their expression of synaptophysin, CAMKII&#x3b1;, and mouse tau in both young and old animals. These results contrast with neurons that develop tau aggregates and also overexpress the transgene, which have few changes in expression of metabolic and synaptic markers. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that tau propagation impacts neuronal functional integrity."

"Abnormal synaptic formation and signaling is one of the key molecular features of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Cortactin binding protein 2 (CTTNBP2), an ASD-linked gene, is known to regulate the subcellular distribution of synaptic proteins, such as cortactin, thereby controlling dendritic spine formation and maintenance. However, it remains unclear how ASD-linked mutations of CTTNBP2 influence its function. Here, using cultured hippocampal neurons and knockin mouse models, we screen seven ASD-linked mutations in the short form of the Cttnbp2 gene and identify that M120I, R533* and D570Y mutations impair CTTNBP2 protein-protein interactions via divergent mechanisms to reduce dendritic spine density in neurons. R533* mutation impairs CTTNBP2 interaction with cortactin due to lack of the C-terminal proline-rich domain. Through an N-C terminal interaction, M120I mutation at the N-terminal region of CTTNBP2 also negatively influences cortactin interaction. D570Y mutation increases the association of CTTNBP2 with microtubule, resulting in a dendritic localization of CTTNBP2, consequently reducing the distribution of CTTNBP2 in dendritic spines and impairing the synaptic function of CTTNBP2. Finally, we generated heterozygous M120I knockin mice to mimic the genetic variation of patients and found they exhibit reduced social interaction. Our study elucidates that different ASD-linked mutations of CTTNBP2 result in diverse molecular deficits, but all have the similar consequence of synaptic impairment."
"The clinical implications of plasmatic cell-free and tumor DNA (cfDNA and ctDNA) are challenging in glioblastoma. This prospective study included 52 consecutive newly diagnosed glioblastoma (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;49) or gliosarcoma (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3) patients treated with concomitant temozolomide and radiotherapy (RT-TMZ), followed by a TMZ maintenance phase. Plasma samples were collected at baseline, before RT-TMZ (pre-RT-TMZ) and at the end of adjuvant TMZ, or at the time of progression in cases of progressive disease (PD). The cfDNA concentration was measured with a fluorometric method, and ctDNA was detected using targeted droplet digital PCR. The main objectives were to analyze the associations between cfDNA and ctDNA measurements during the course of treatment with PD and survival. There was a significant decrease in median cfDNA concentration from baseline to pre-RT-TMZ-19.4 versus 9.7&#xa0;ng/mL (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001)-in the entire cohort. In patients with PD, a significant increase in cfDNA concentration from pre-RT-TMZ to time of PD was observed, from 9.7 versus 13.1&#xa0;ng/mL (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.037), respectively, while no difference was observed for nonprogressive patients. Neither the cfDNA concentration at baseline nor its kinetics correlated with survival. ctDNA was detected in 2 patients (3.8%) and only in gliosarcoma subtypes.Trial registration ClinicalTrial, NCT02617745. Registered 1 December 2015, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02617745?term=glioplak&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1 ."
"A subset of glioblastomas (GBMs) harbors potentially druggable oncogenic FGFR3-TACC3 (F3T3) fusions. However, their associated molecular and clinical features are poorly understood. Here we analyze the frequency of F3T3-fusion positivity, its associated genetic and methylation profiles, and its impact on survival in 906 IDH-wildtype GBM patients. We establish an F3T3 prevalence of 4.1% and delineate its associations with cancer signaling pathway alterations. F3T3-positive GBMs had lower tumor mutational and copy-number alteration burdens than F3T3-wildtype GBMs. Although F3T3 fusions were predominantly mutually exclusive with other oncogenic RTK pathway alterations, they did rarely co-occur with EGFR amplification. They were less likely to harbor TP53 alterations. By methylation profiling, they were more likely to be assigned the mesenchymal or RTK II subclass. Despite being older at diagnosis and having similar frequencies of MGMT promoter hypermethylation, patients with F3T3-positive GBMs lived about 8&#xa0;months longer than those with F3T3-wildtype tumors. While consistent with IDH-wildtype GBM, F3T3-positive GBMs exhibit distinct biological features, underscoring the importance of pursuing molecular studies prior to clinical trial enrollment and targeted treatment."
"The hexanucleotide repeat expansion in intron 1 of the C9orf72 gene causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. In addition to the effects of the pathogenic expansion, a role of intermediate-length alleles has been suggested in ALS, corticobasal degeneration and Parkinson's disease. Due to the rarity of intermediate-length alleles with over 20 repeats and the geographical variability in their frequency, large studies that account for population stratification are needed to elucidate their effects. To this aim, we used repeat-primed PCR and confirmatory PCR assays to determine the C9orf72 repeat allele lengths in 705 ALS patients and 3958 controls from Finland. After exclusion of expansion carriers (25.5% of the ALS patients and 0.2% of the controls), we compared the frequency of intermediate-length allele carriers of 525 ALS cases and 3950 controls using several intermediate-length allele thresholds (7-45, 17-45, 21-45, 24-45 and 24-30). The carriership of an intermediate-length allele did not associate with ALS (Fisher's test, all p&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;0.15) nor was there any association with survival (p&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;0.33), when we divided our control group into three age groups (18-65, 66-84 and 85-105&#xa0;years). Carriership of two intermediate-length alleles was associated with ALS, when the longer allele was&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;17 repeats (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002, OR 5.32 95% CI 2.02-14.05) or &#x2265;&#x2009;21 repeats (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.00016, OR 15.21 95% CI 3.79-61.0). Our results show that intermediate-length alleles are a risk factor of ALS when present in both alleles, whereas carrying just one intermediate-length allele was not associated with ALS or survival."
"The most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a GGGGCC (G4C2) hexanucleotide repeat expansions in first intron of the C9orf72 gene. The accumulation of repetitive RNA sequences can mediate toxicity potentially through the formation of intranuclear RNA foci that sequester key RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), and non-ATG mediated translation into toxic dipeptide protein repeats. However, the contribution of RBP sequestration to the mechanisms underlying RNA-mediated toxicity remain unknown. Here we show that the ALS-associated RNA-binding protein, Matrin-3 (MATR3), colocalizes with G4C2 RNA foci in patient tissues as well as iPSC-derived motor neurons harboring the C9orf72 mutation. Hyperexpansion of C9 repeats perturbed subcellular distribution and levels of endogenous MATR3 in C9-ALS patient-derived motor neurons. Interestingly, we observed that ectopic expression of human MATR3 strongly mitigates G4C2-mediated neurodegeneration in vivo. MATR3-mediated suppression of C9 toxicity was dependent on the RNA-binding domain of MATR3. Importantly, we found that expression of MATR3 reduced the levels of RAN-translation products in mammalian cells in an RNA-dependent manner. Finally, we have shown that knocking down endogenous MATR3 in C9-ALS patient-derived iPSC neurons decreased the presence of G4C2 RNA foci in the nucleus. Overall, these studies suggest that MATR3 genetically modifies the neuropathological and the pathobiology of C9orf72 ALS through modulating the RNA foci and RAN translation."
"Frequently reported neurotoxic sequelae of cancer treatment include cognitive deficits and sensorimotor abnormalities that have long-lasting negative effects on the quality of life of an increasing number of cancer survivors. The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood and there is no effective treatment. We show here that cisplatin treatment of mice not only caused cognitive dysfunction but also impaired sensorimotor function. These functional deficits are associated with reduced myelin density and complexity in the cingulate and sensorimotor cortex. At the ultrastructural level, myelin abnormalities were characterized by decompaction. We used this model to examine the effect of bexarotene, an agonist of the RXR-family of nuclear receptors. Administration of only five daily doses of bexarotene after completion of cisplatin treatment was sufficient to normalize myelin density and fiber coherency and to restore myelin compaction in cingulate and sensorimotor cortex. Functionally, bexarotene normalized performance of cisplatin-treated mice in tests for cognitive and sensorimotor function. RNAseq analysis identified the TR/RXR pathway as one of the top canonical pathways activated by administration of bexarotene to cisplatin-treated mice. Bexarotene also activated neuregulin and netrin pathways that are implicated in myelin formation/maintenance, synaptic function and axonal guidance. In conclusion, short term treatment with bexarotene is sufficient to reverse the adverse effects of cisplatin on white matter structure, cognitive function, and sensorimotor performance. These encouraging findings warrant further studies into potential clinical translation and the underlying mechanisms of bexarotene for chemobrain."
"Mutations in the PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and Parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (PARKIN) genes are associated with familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). PINK1, a protein kinase, and PARKIN, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, control the specific elimination of dysfunctional or superfluous mitochondria, thus fine-tuning mitochondrial network and preserving energy metabolism. PINK1 regulates PARKIN translocation in impaired mitochondria and drives their removal via selective autophagy, a process known as mitophagy. As knowledge obtained using different PINK1 and PARKIN transgenic animal models is being gathered, growing evidence supports the contribution of mitophagy impairment to several human pathologies, including PD and Alzheimer's diseases (AD). Therefore, therapeutic interventions aiming to modulate PINK1/PARKIN signalling might have the potential to treat these diseases. In this review, we will start by discussing how the interplay of PINK1 and PARKIN signalling helps mediate mitochondrial physiology. We will continue by debating the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases, as well as eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma, and the causative factors leading to PINK1/PARKIN-mediated neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Finally, we will discuss PINK1/PARKIN gene augmentation possibilities with a particular focus on AD, PD and glaucoma."
"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is largely linked to deletion or mutation of the Survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene located on chromosome 5q13. Type III (Kugelberg-Welander disease) is the mildest childhood form and patients may become ambulatory and have a normal life expectancy. We report the clinical history and morphological findings of a 55-year-old woman who began to experience motor problems at the age of two. She was never fully ambulatory, and her severe scoliosis required the insertion of surgical rod at age 19. Unexpectedly, around 35&#xa0;years of age, she began to experience sensory symptoms best characterized as a myelo-radiculo-neuropathy with pain as the dominant symptom. Investigations never clarified the etiology of these symptoms. Molecular confirmation of SMA type III was done post-mortem. Neuropathological examination showed classic changes of lower motor neuron neurodegeneration, in line with those reported in the single molecularly confirmed case published so far, and with findings in rare cases reported prior to the discovery of the gene defect. A key autopsy finding was the presence of a severe superficial siderosis of the lower half of the spinal cord. In recent years, the concept of duropathy was put forward, associating superficial siderosis of the spinal cord with various spinal abnormalities, some of which were present in our patient. The presence of significant hemosiderin deposits in the spinal cord and sensory nerve roots with associated tissue and axonal damage provide a plausible explanation for the unexpected sensory symptomatology in this mild lower motor neurodegeneration."
"In addition to its role as an auxiliary subunit of A-type voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels, we have previously reported that the single transmembrane protein Dipeptidyl Peptidase Like 6 (DPP6) impacts neuronal and synaptic development. DPP6-KO mice are impaired in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory and exhibit smaller brain size. Using immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, we report here a novel structure in hippocampal area CA1 that was significantly more prevalent in aging DPP6-KO mice compared to WT mice of the same age and that these structures were observed earlier in development in DPP6-KO mice. These novel structures appeared as clusters of large puncta that colocalized NeuN, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A. They also partially labeled for MAP2, and with synapsin-1 and VGluT1 labeling on their periphery. Electron microscopy revealed that these structures are abnormal, enlarged presynaptic swellings filled with mainly fibrous material with occasional peripheral, presynaptic active zones forming synapses. Immunofluorescence imaging then showed that a number of markers for aging and especially Alzheimer's disease were found as higher levels in these novel structures in aging DPP6-KO mice compared to WT. Together these results indicate that aging DPP6-KO mice have increased numbers of novel, abnormal presynaptic structures associated with several markers of Alzheimer's disease."
"The purpose of this study was to analyze the impact of copy number variations (CNV) on sporadic pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) prognosis, to identify specific prognosis markers according to the known clinico-pathological classification. CGH array analysis was performed on 195 fresh-frozen PitNETs (56 gonadotroph, 11 immunonegative, 56 somatotroph, 39 lactotroph and 33 corticotroph), with 5&#xa0;years post-surgery follow-up (124 recurrences), classified according to the five-tiered grading classification (invasion, Ki-67, mitotic index and p53 positivity). Effect of alterations on recurrence was studied using logistic regression models. Transcriptomic analysis of 32 lactotroph tumors was performed. The quantity of CNV was dependent on tumor type: higher in lactotroph (median(min-max)&#x2009;=&#x2009;38% (0-97) of probes) compared to corticotroph (11% (0-77)), somatotroph (5% (0-99)), gonadotroph (0% (0-10)) and immunonegative tumors (0% (0-17). It was not predictive of recurrence in the whole cohort. In lactotroph tumors, genome instability, especially quantity of gains, significantly predicted recurrence independently of invasion and proliferation (p-value&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02, OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.2). However, no specific CNV was found as a prognostic marker. Transcriptomic analysis of the genes included in the CNV and associated with prognosis didn't show significantly overrepresented pathway. In somatotroph and corticotroph tumors, USP8 and GNAS mutations were not associated with genome disruption or recurrence respectively. To conclude, CGH array analysis showed genome instability was dependent on PitNET type. Lactotroph tumors were highly altered and the quantity of altered genome was associated with poorer prognosis though the mechanism is unclear, whereas gonadotroph and immunonegative tumors showed the same 'quiet' profile, leaving the mechanism underlying tumorigenesis open to question."
"Mutations in the RYR1 gene, encoding the skeletal muscle calcium channel RyR1, lead to congenital myopathies, through expression of a channel with abnormal permeability and/or in reduced amount, but the direct functional whole organism consequences of exclusive reduction in RyR1 amount have never been studied. We have developed and characterized a mouse model with inducible muscle specific RYR1 deletion. Tamoxifen-induced recombination in the RYR1 gene at adult age resulted in a progressive reduction in the protein amount reaching a stable level of 50% of the initial amount, and was associated with a progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Measurement of calcium fluxes in isolated muscle fibers demonstrated a reduction in the amplitude of RyR1-related calcium release mirroring the reduction in the protein amount. Alterations in the muscle structure were observed, with fibers atrophy, abnormal mitochondria distribution and membrane remodeling. An increase in the expression level of many proteins was observed, as well as an inhibition of the autophagy process. This model demonstrates that RyR1 reduction is sufficient to recapitulate most features of Central Core Disease, and accordingly similar alterations were observed in muscle biopsies from Dusty Core Disease patients (a subtype of Central Core Disease), pointing to common pathophysiological mechanisms related to RyR1 reduction."
"The brain pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the misfolding and aggregation of both the amyloid beta (A&#x3b2;) peptide and hyperphosphorylated forms of the tau protein. Initial A&#x3b2; deposition is considered to trigger a sequence of deleterious events contributing to tau pathology, neuroinflammation and ultimately causing the loss of synapses and neurons. To assess the effect of anti-A&#x3b2; immunization in this context, we generated a mouse model by overexpressing the human tau protein in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice. A&#x3b2; plaque deposition combined with human tau overexpression leads to an array of pathological manifestations including the formation of tau-positive dystrophic neurites and accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau at the level of neuritic plaques. Remarkably, the presence of human tau reduces microglial clustering in proximity to the A&#x3b2; plaques, which may affect the barrier role of microglia. In this mouse model, continuous administration of anti-A&#x3b2; antibodies enhances the clustering of microglial cells even in the presence of tau. Anti-A&#x3b2; immunization increases plaque compaction, reduces the spread of tau in the hippocampal formation and prevents the formation of tau-positive dystrophic neurites. However, the treatment does not significantly reduce tau-induced neurodegeneration in the dentate gyrus. These results highlight that anti-A&#x3b2; immunization is able to enhance microglial activity around neuritic plaques, mitigating part of the tau-induced pathological manifestations."
"Considering its intolerance to ischemia, it is of critical importance for the brain to efficiently process microvascular occlusions and maintain tissue perfusion. In addition to collateral microvascular flow and enzymatic degradation of emboli, the endothelium has the potential to engulf microparticles and thereby recanalize the vessel, through a process called angiophagy. Here, we set out to study the dynamics of angiophagy in relation to cytoskeletal remodeling in vitro and reperfusion in vivo. We show that polystyrene microspheres and fibrin clots are actively taken up by (brain) endothelial cells in vitro, and chart the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton during this process using live cell imaging. Whereas microspheres were taken up through the formation of a cup structure by the apical endothelial membrane, fibrin clots were completely engulfed by the cells, marked by dense F-actin accumulation surrounding the clot. Both microspheres and fibrin clots were retained in the endothelial cells. Notably, fibrin clots were not degraded intracellularly. Using an in vivo microembolization rat model, in which microparticles are injected into the common carotid artery, we found that microspheres are transported by the endothelium from the microvasculature into the brain parenchyma. Microembolization with microspheres caused temporal opening of the blood-brain barrier and vascular nonperfusion, followed by microsphere extravasation and restoration of vessel perfusion over time. Taken together, angiophagy is accompanied by active cytoskeletal remodeling of the endothelium, and is an effective mechanism to restore perfusion of the occluded microvasculature in vivo."
"The kinase TTBK1 is predominantly&#xa0;expressed in the central nervous system and has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis through its ability to phosphorylate the proteins tau and TDP-43. Mutations in the closely related gene TTBK2 cause spinocerebellar ataxia, type 11. However, it remains unknown whether altered TTBK1 activity alone can drive neurodegeneration. In order to characterize the consequences of neuronal TTBK1 upregulation in adult brains, we have generated a transgenic mouse model with inducible pan-neuronal expression of human TTBK1. We find that these inducible TTBK1 transgenic mice (iTTBK1 Tg) exhibit motor and cognitive phenotypes, including decreased grip strength, hyperactivity, limb-clasping, and spatial memory impairment. These behavioral phenotypes occur in conjunction with progressive weight loss, neuroinflammation, and severe cerebellar degeneration with Purkinje neuron loss. Phenotype onset begins weeks after TTBK1 induction, culminating in average mortality around 7&#xa0;weeks post induction. The iTTBK1 Tg animals lack any obvious accumulation of pathological tau or TDP-43, indicating that TTBK1 expression drives neurodegeneration in the absence of detectable pathological protein deposition. In exploring TTBK1 functions, we identified the autophagy related protein GABARAP to be a novel interacting partner of TTBK1 and show that GABARAP protein levels increase in the brain following induction of TTBK1. These iTTBK1 Tg mice exhibit phenotypes reminiscent of spinocerebellar ataxia, and represent a new model of cerebellar neurodegeneration."
"Massive deposition of amyloid &#x3b2; peptides (A&#x3b2;) as senile plaques (SP) characterizes the brain pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). SPs exhibit a variety of morphologies, although little is known about the SP components that determine their morphology. Collagenous Alzheimer amyloid plaque component (CLAC) is one of the major non-A&#x3b2; proteinaceous components of SP amyloid in AD brains. Here we show that overexpression of CLAC precursor (CLAC-P) in the brains of APP transgenic mice results in a significant remodeling of amyloid pathology, i.e., reduction in diffuse-type amyloid plaques and an increase in compact plaques laden with thioflavin S-positive amyloid cores. In vivo microdialysis revealed a significant decrease in A&#x3b2; in the brain interstitial fluid of CLAC-P/APP double transgenic mice compared with APP transgenic mice. These findings implicate CLAC in the compaction of A&#x3b2; in amyloid plaques and the brain dynamics of A&#x3b2;."
"Glioblastoma is an aggressive form of brain cancer that has seen only marginal improvements in its bleak survival outlook of 12-15&#xa0;months over the last forty years. There is therefore an urgent need for the development of advanced drug screening platforms and systems that can better recapitulate glioblastoma's infiltrative biology, a process largely responsible for its relentless propensity for recurrence and progression. Recent advances in stem cell biology have allowed the generation of artificial tridimensional brain-like tissue termed cerebral organoids. In addition to their potential to model brain development, these reagents are providing much needed synthetic humanoid scaffolds to model glioblastoma's infiltrative capacity in a faithful and scalable manner. Here, we highlight and review the early breakthroughs in this growing field and discuss its potential future role for glioblastoma research."
"The molecular chaperone Clusterin (CLU) impacts the amyloid pathway in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but its role in tau pathology is unknown. We observed CLU co-localization with tau aggregates in AD and primary tauopathies and CLU levels were upregulated in response to tau accumulation. To further elucidate the effect of CLU on tau pathology, we utilized a gene delivery approach in CLU knock-out (CLU KO) mice to drive expression of tau bearing the P301L mutation. We found that loss of CLU was associated with exacerbated tau pathology and anxiety-like behaviors in our mouse model of tauopathy. Additionally, we found that CLU dramatically inhibited tau fibrilization using an in vitro assay. Together, these results demonstrate that CLU plays a major role in both amyloid and tau pathologies in AD."
"Recurrent RELA and YAP1 fusions are intimately associated with tumorigenesis in supratentorial ependymomas. Chromothripsis and focal copy number alterations involving 11q are hallmarks of these tumors. However, it is unknown whether the chromosomal alterations are a direct causal event resulting in fusion transcripts. In addition, the biological significance of the RELA fusion variants and YAP1 fusions is not yet fully characterized. In this study, we generated gene rearrangements on 11q with the CRISPR/Cas9 system and investigated the formation of oncogenic ependymoma fusion genes. Further, we examined the oncogenic potential of RELA fusion variants and YAP1 fusions in a lentiviral gene transfer model. We observed that endogenous RELA fusion events were successfully induced by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome rearrangement in cultured cells. In vivo genome editing in mouse brain resulted in the development of ependymoma-like brain tumors that harbored the Rela fusion gene. All RELA fusion variants tested, except a variant lacking the Rel homology domain, were able to induce tumor formation, albeit with different efficacy. Furthermore, expression of YAP1-FAM118B and YAP1-MAMLD1 fusions induced the formation of spindle-cell-like tumors at varying efficacy. Our results indicate that chromosomal rearrangements involving the Rela locus are the causal event for the formation of Rela fusion-driven ependymomas in mice. Furthermore, the type of RELA. fusion might affect the aggressiveness of tumors and that the Rel homology domain is essential for the oncogenic functions of RELA. fusions. The YAP1 fusion genes are also oncogenic when expressed in mice."
"In humans, iatrogenic transmission of cerebral amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;)-amyloidosis is suspected following inoculation of pituitary-derived hormones or dural grafts presumably contaminated with A&#x3b2; proteins as well as after cerebral surgeries. Experimentally, intracerebral inoculation of brain homogenate extracts containing misfolded A&#x3b2; can seed A&#x3b2; deposition in transgenic mouse models of amyloidosis or in non-human primates. The transmission of cerebral A&#x3b2; is governed by the host and by the inoculated samples. It is critical to better characterize the propensities of different hosts to develop A&#x3b2; deposition after contamination by an A&#x3b2;-positive sample as well as to better assess which biological samples can transmit this lesion. A&#x3b2; precursor protein (huAPP<sub>wt</sub>) mice express humanized non-mutated forms of A&#x3b2; precursor protein and do not spontaneously develop A&#x3b2; or amyloid deposits. We found that inoculation of A&#x3b2;-positive brain extracts from Alzheimer patients in these mice leads to a sparse A&#x3b2; deposition close to the alveus 18&#xa0;months post-inoculation. However, it does not induce cortical or hippocampal A&#x3b2; deposition. Secondary inoculation of apparently amyloid deposit-free hippocampal extracts from these huAPP<sub>wt</sub> mice to APP<sub>swe</sub>/PS1<sub>dE9</sub> mouse models of amyloidosis enhanced A&#x3b2; deposition in the alveus 9&#xa0;months post-inoculation. This suggests that A&#x3b2; seeds issued from human brain samples can persist in furtive forms in brain tissues while maintaining their ability to foster A&#x3b2; deposition in receptive hosts that overexpress endogenous A&#x3b2;. This work emphasizes the need for high-level preventive measures, especially in the context of neurosurgery, to prevent the risk of iatrogenic transmission of A&#x3b2; lesions from samples with sparse amyloid markers."
"The Ihara epileptic rat (IER) is a mutant model with limbic-like seizures whose pathology and causative gene remain elusive. In this report, via linkage analysis, we identified Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule-like 1(Dscaml1) as the responsible gene for IER. A single base mutation in Dscaml1 causes abnormal splicing, leading to lack of DSCAML1. IERs have enhanced seizure susceptibility and accelerated kindling establishment. Furthermore, GABAergic neurons are severely reduced in the entorhinal cortex (ECx) of these animals. Voltage-sensitive dye imaging that directly presents the excitation status of brain slices revealed abnormally persistent excitability in IER ECx. This suggests that reduced GABAergic neurons may cause weak sustained entorhinal cortex activations, leading to natural kindling&#xa0;via&#xa0;the perforant path that could cause dentate gyrus hypertrophy and epileptogenesis. Furthermore, we identified a single nucleotide substitution in a human epilepsy that would result in one amino acid change in DSCAML1 (A2105T mutation). The mutant DSCAML1<sup>A2105T</sup> protein is not presented on the cell surface, losing its homophilic cell adhesion ability. We generated knock-in mice (Dscaml1<sup>A2105T</sup>) carrying the corresponding mutation and observed reduced GABAergic neurons in the ECx as well as spike-and-wave electrocorticogram. We conclude that DSCAML1 is required for GABAergic neuron placement in the ECx and suppression of seizure susceptibility in rodents. Our findings suggest that mutations in DSCAML1 may affect seizure susceptibility in humans."
"Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is a rare hereditary muscle disease characterized by progressive distal limb weakness, ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, bulbar muscle weakness and rimmed vacuoles on muscle biopsy. Recently, CGG repeat expansions in the noncoding regions of two genes, LRP12 and GIPC1, have been reported to be causative for OPDM. Furthermore, neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) has been recently reported to be caused by CGG repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC. We aimed to identify and to clinicopathologically characterize patients with OPDM who have CGG repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC (OPDM_NOTCH2NLC). Note that 211 patients from 201 families, who were clinically or clinicopathologically diagnosed with OPDM or oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, were screened for CGG expansions in NOTCH2NLC by repeat primed-PCR. Clinical information and muscle pathology slides of identified patients with OPDM_NOTCH2NLC were re-reviewed. Intra-myonuclear inclusions were evaluated using immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy (EM). Seven Japanese OPDM patients had CGG repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC. All seven patients clinically demonstrated ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, dysarthria and muscle weakness; they myopathologically had intra-myonuclear inclusions stained with anti-poly-ubiquitinated proteins, anti-SUMO1 and anti-p62 antibodies, which were diagnostic of NIID (typically on skin biopsy), in addition to rimmed vacuoles. The sample for EM was available only from one patient, which demonstrated intranuclear inclusions of 12.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.6&#xa0;nm in diameter. We identified seven patients with OPDM_NOTCH2NLC. Our patients had various additional central and/or peripheral nervous system involvement, although all were clinicopathologically compatible; thus, they were diagnosed as having OPDM and expanding a phenotype of the neuromyodegenerative disease caused by CGG repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC."
"Focal malformations of cortical development (MCD) are linked to somatic brain mutations occurring during neurodevelopment. Mild malformation of cortical development with oligodendroglial hyperplasia in epilepsy (MOGHE) is a newly recognized clinico-pathological entity associated with pediatric drug-resistant focal epilepsy, and amenable to neurosurgical treatment. MOGHE is histopathologically characterized by clusters of increased oligodendroglial cell densities, patchy zones of hypomyelination, and heterotopic neurons in the white matter. The molecular etiology of MOGHE remained unknown so far. We hypothesized a contribution of mosaic brain variants and performed deep targeted gene sequencing on 20 surgical MOGHE brain samples from a single-center cohort of pediatric patients. We identified somatic pathogenic SLC35A2 variants in 9/20 (45%) patients with mosaic rates ranging from 7 to 52%. SLC35A2 encodes a UDP-galactose transporter, previously implicated in other malformations of cortical development (MCD) and a rare type of congenital disorder of glycosylation. To further clarify the histological features of SLC35A2-brain tissues, we then collected 17 samples with pathogenic SLC35A2 variants from a multicenter cohort of MCD cases. Histopathological reassessment including anti-Olig2 staining confirmed a MOGHE diagnosis in all cases. Analysis by droplet digital PCR of pools of microdissected cells from one MOGHE tissue revealed a variant enrichment in clustered oligodendroglial cells and heterotopic neurons. Through an international consortium, we assembled an unprecedented series of 26 SLC35A2-MOGHE cases providing evidence that mosaic SLC35A2 variants, likely occurred in a neuroglial progenitor cell during brain development, are a genetic marker for MOGHE."
"Autoimmune disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) comprise a broad spectrum of clinical entities. The stratification of patients based on the recognized autoantigen is of great importance for therapy optimization and for concepts of pathogenicity, but for most of these patients, the actual target of their autoimmune response is unknown. Here we investigated oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein (OMGP) as autoimmune target, because OMGP is expressed specifically in the CNS and there on oligodendrocytes and neurons. Using a stringent cell-based assay, we detected autoantibodies to OMGP in serum of 8/352 patients with multiple sclerosis, 1/28 children with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and unexpectedly, also in one patient with psychosis, but in none of 114 healthy controls. Since OMGP is GPI-anchored, we validated its recognition also in GPI-anchored form. The autoantibodies to OMGP were largely IgG1 with a contribution of IgG4, indicating cognate T cell help. We found high levels of soluble OMGP in human spinal fluid, presumably due to shedding of the GPI-linked OMGP. Analyzing the pathogenic relevance of autoimmunity to OMGP in an animal model, we found that OMGP-specific T cells induce a novel type of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis dominated by meningitis above the cortical convexities. This unusual localization may be directed by intrathecal uptake and presentation of OMGP by meningeal phagocytes. Together, OMGP-directed autoimmunity provides a new element of heterogeneity, helping to improve the stratification of patients for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes."
"Previous studies showed that injection of tissue extracts containing amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) aggregates accelerate amyloid deposition in the brain of mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through prion-like mechanisms. In this study, we evaluated whether brain amyloidosis could be accelerated by blood infusions, procedures that have been shown to transmit prion diseases in animals and humans. Young transgenic mice infused with whole blood or plasma from old animals with extensive A&#x3b2; deposition in their brains developed significantly higher levels brain amyloidosis and neuroinflammation compared to untreated animals or mice infused with wild type blood. Similarly, intra-venous injection of purified A&#x3b2; aggregates accelerated amyloid pathology, supporting the concept that A&#x3b2; seeds present in blood can reach the brain to promote neuropathological alterations in the brain of treated animals. However, an amyloid-enhancing effect of other factors present in the blood of donors cannot be discarded. Our results may help to understand the role of peripheral (amyloid-dependent or -independent) factors implicated in the development of AD and uncover new strategies for disease intervention."
"Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are caused by a length-dependent axonopathy of long corticospinal neurons, but how axons of these cortical projection neurons (PNs) degenerate remains elusive. We generated isogenic human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines for two ATL1 missense mutations associated with SPG3A, the most common early-onset autosomal dominant HSP. In hPSC-derived cortical PNs, ATL1 mutations resulted in reduced axonal outgrowth, impaired axonal transport, and accumulated axonal swellings, recapitulating disease-specific phenotypes. Importantly, ATL1 mutations dysregulated proteolipid gene expression, reduced lipid droplet size in astrocytes, and unexpectedly disrupted cholesterol transfer from glia to neurons, leading to cholesterol deficiency in SPG3A cortical PNs. Applying cholesterol or conditioned medium from control astrocytes, a major source of cholesterol in the brain, rescued aberrant axonal transport and swellings in SPG3A cortical PNs. Furthermore, treatment with the NR1H2 agonist GW3965 corrected lipid droplet defects in SPG3A astrocytes and promoted cholesterol efflux from astrocytes, leading to restoration of cholesterol levels and rescue of axonal degeneration in SPG3A cortical PNs. These results reveal a non-cell autonomous mechanism underlying axonal degeneration of cortical PNs mediated by impaired cholesterol homeostasis in glia."
