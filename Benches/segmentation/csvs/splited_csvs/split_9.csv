Abstract
"While there is abundant evidence for a role of 5-HT and the amygdala in anxiety and depression, the role of 5-HT in this brain region in schizophrenia is less well understood. We therefore examined the effects of local 5-HT depletion in the amygdala on psychotomimetic drug-induced locomotor hyperactivity and prepulse inhibition, two animal model of aspects of schizophrenia. Pentobarbital-anaesthetized (60 mg/kg, i.p.) male Sprague-Dawley rats were stereotaxically micro-injected with 0.5 microl of a 5 microg/mul solution of the 5-HT neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) into either the basolateral (BLA) or central nucleus of amygdala (CeN). Two weeks after the surgery, rats with BLA lesions did not show changes in either psychotomimetic drug-induced locomotor hyperactivity or prepulse inhibition. In contrast, rats with CeN lesions showed significant disruption of prepulse inhibition, but no changes in psychotomimetic drug-induced locomotor hyperactivity. Neurochemical analysis and autoradiographic labelling of 5-HT transporter sites showed that a good degree of anatomical selectivity was obtained. Following administration of 5,7-DHT into the amygdala, the concentration of 5-HT was significantly reduced. Similarly, 5-HT transporter autoradiographs showed differential and selective lesions of 5-HT innervation in targeted subregions of the amygdala. These results provide evidence for differential involvement of 5-HT projections within the amygdala in prepulse inhibition but not locomotor hyperactivity. Thus, the present study supports the view that 5-HT in the amygdala may be involved in aspects of schizophrenia and a target for antipsychotic drug action."
"An accumulation of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) due to an imbalance between anabolism and catabolism triggers Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neprilysin is a rate-limiting peptidase, which participates in the catabolism of Abeta in brain. We investigated whether rats continuously infused with thiorphan, a specific inhibitor for neprilysin, into the cerebral ventricle cause cognitive dysfunction, with an accumulation of Abeta in the brain. Thiorphan-infused rats displayed significant cognitive dysfunction in the ability to discriminate in the object recognition test and spatial memory in the water maze test, but not in other hippocampus-dependent learning and memory tasks. Thiorphan infusion also elevated the Abeta40 level in the insoluble fraction of the cerebral cortex, but not that of the hippocampus. There was no significant difference in the nicotine-stimulated release of acetylcholine in the hippocampus between vehicle- and thiorphan-infused rats. These results indicate that continuous infusion of thiorphan into the cerebral ventricle causes cognitive dysfunction by raising the level of Abeta in the cerebral cortex, and suggest that a reduction of neprilysin activity contribute to the deposition of Abeta and development of AD."
"Single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to test the assumption that kinesthetic imagery of action is more 'motor' than visual imagery of action. We assessed corticospinal excitability during motor imagery of a thumb-palm opposition movement by recording potentials evoked by TMS from two hand muscles that would (opponens pollicis, OP, target) or would not (abductor digiti minimi, ADM, control) be activated during actual performance of the very same movement. Participants were asked to imagine the thumb-palm opposition movement while maintaining first person imagery that was either purely visual or predominately kinesthetic. The motor imagery task was performed in two conditions in which the imagined and the actual hand could be either congruent or incongruent. Facilitation of potentials recorded from OP was higher during imagery carried out in mentally congruent than incongruent postures. This effect was largely due to lack of excitability recorded during incongruent kinesthetic imagery, which was indistinguishable from baseline imagery of the static hand. All other conditions differed from static imagery regardless of position. No significant effects were found in a control muscle (ADM) thus indicating that the effect was not related to spatial coding. Subjective reports obtained after the experiment indicate that the results cannot be ascribed to qualitative differences in the imagery experienced. For relatively simple motor tasks requiring no 'expertise' we found no detectable difference in the motor cortex due to imagery modality."
"The role of histamine in brain function has been studied using histidine decarboxylase (HDC) deficient male mice. As the effects of HDC deficiency on brain function might be sex-dependent, we behaviorally analyzed Hdc(-/-) and control female mice. Compared to female control mice, Hdc(-/-) female mice showed hypoactivity, increased measures of anxiety, impairments in water-maze performance, but enhanced passive avoidance memory retention. Following behavioral testing, arginine vasopression (AVP) immunoreactivity was higher in the dorsal hypothalamus and central and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala of Hdc(-/-) than Hdc(+/+) mice. Finally, MAP2 immunoreactivity in the hippocampal CA1 region correlated positively with measures of anxiety in the open-field and light-dark tests and negatively with performance during the hidden sessions of the water-maze. As the effects of HDC deficiency on object recognition, water-maze, and rotorod performance, were sex-dependent, it is important to consider potential effects of sex in the interpretation of the role of histaminergic neurotransmission in brain function."
"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are known to play a role in several aspects of cocaine addiction. Recently, systemic administration of the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine was shown to block the induction of long-term locomotor sensitization to cocaine. Behavioral sensitization being a model of long-term neuroadaptations to chronic cocaine exposure, the goal of the current study was to identify the anatomical localization, as well as the nature, of the nicotinic receptors involved. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were stereotaxically implanted with bilateral cannula into either the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or the nucleus accumbens (Nacc). On each of the six consecutive days, rats were microinjected bilaterally with the selective nicotinic antagonists dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DHbetaE), methyllycaconitine (MLA) or saline, followed by an intra-peritoneal injection of cocaine (15 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline. Following a 2-week withdrawal period, rats received a final injection of cocaine in the absence of nicotinic antagonist to test for sensitization. When microinjected into the VTA, DHbetaE, but not MLA, prevented the induction of behavioral sensitization to cocaine. In contrast, behavioral sensitization was present in rats receiving DHbetaE microinjections into the Nacc. Neither antagonist, whether injected into the VTA or the Nacc had any significant effect on the acute locomotor response to cocaine. Given the subtype selectivity of the nicotinic antagonists employed, heteromeric beta2-containing (beta2*) nAChRs, but not homomeric alpha7* nAChRs, in the VTA may be involved in the neuroadaptive changes underlying cocaine sensitization."
"We studied the inhibitory (PPI) and facilitatory (PPF) behavioural effects of brief light flashes presented as prepulses just prior to the acoustic startle reflex (ASR) in intact rats and in rats that had a bilateral excision of visual cortex (VC). The VC-lesioned and control groups (n=5, 5) were near identical in PPF for flashes presented 5-20 ms before the ASR and near identical in PPI for flashes presented 60 ms before the ASR. These findings differ from those of a case report of a human patient following occipital cortex resection, for whom light flashes failed to produce either acoustic startle PPF or PPI if the flash were presented to the portion of the visual field in which she could not see; they differ also from data obtained in functionally decorticate rats, for which a light flash produced no startle PPI, but instead a late-appearing exaggerated PPF. In the present experiment the lesion was restricted to VC, while in contrast the occipital resection in the human patient included posterior areas of the parietal and temporal lobe, and functional decortication in the rat disengaged the entire cortex. The greater extent of these two effective surgical procedures may have been responsible for their greater behavioural effects; otherwise, the complete loss of reflex control by photic stimulation in the human patient but not in the rat may reflect the greater functional importance and anatomical complexity of the VC in humans."
"In this study, we describe the behavior of laboratory rats in a recently developed observation arena, the Concentric Square Field (CSF). The CSF contains a number of areas designed to provoke exploration and behaviors associated with risk assessment, risk taking and security seeking in an environment not previously experienced. The model includes sheltered, open and elevated areas, a hole board device, areas with different light conditions, and wall-enclosed corridors. The rationale behind the CSF is to meet the demand for multivariate test situations that are not predictive in the sense of previous definition of a specific purpose of measuring a certain mental state. We define multivariate as being a free choice of where to stay in areas of different qualities. In the present study, identification of risky as opposed to safe areas is based on the retrieval behavior in lactating females and hoarding of food pellets in food-deprived males. Furthermore, we describe the effects of pre-trial food deprivation, immobilization, social stress, strain differences (Sprague-Dawley, Wistar and Lister Hooded males), sex differences (Sprague-Dawley) and repeated testing. Besides the conventional statistics, a principal component analysis (PCA) helped to discriminate between the various categories tested. Our conclusion is that the multivariate and non-predictive test situation (CSF) and the use of PCA provide a good tool for ethoexperimental analysis."
Qualitative differences in strategy selection during foraging in a partially baited maze were assessed in young and old rats. The baited and non-baited arms were at a fixed position in space and marked by a specific olfactory cue. The senescent rats did more re-entries during the first four-trial block but were more rapid than the young rats in selecting the reinforced arms during the first visits. Dissociation between the olfactory spatial cue reference by rotating the maze revealed that only few old subjects relied on olfactory cues to select the baited arms and the remainder relied mainly on the visuo-spatial cues.
"Acute intrathecal (i.t.) bovine adrenal medulla 22 (BAM22, 10 nmol), an endogenous opioid peptide, induced equipotent thermal antinociception in na&#xef;ve and morphine-tolerant rats while chronic BAM22 resulted in hyperalgesia and decrease in the effectiveness of antinociception. In rats made tolerant to morphine, prior administration of BAM22 (10 nmol, i.t.) significantly resumed antinociceptive response of morphine. The present study demonstrated that BAM22 was able to modulate maintenance of morphine tolerance."
"Previous studies with acute tryptophan depletion, leading to transient central 5-HT reductions, showed no effects on affective behavior but impaired object memory. In the present study, the behavioral effects of a 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) lesion in the dorsal raphe were evaluated in animal models of anxiety (open field test), depression (forced swimming test), behavioral inhibition (discrete fixed interval test) and cognition (object recognition task). The corticosterone response to a stress condition was examined at several intervals after 5,7-DHT treatment. The substantial reduction in neuronal 5-HT markers in the dorsal raphe did not affect anxiety-related, depressive-like or impulsive behavior. Compared to the SHAM group, the lesioned rats showed a lower response latency to obtain a reward, indicating a quick and accurate reaction to a stimulus. No differences were found in the progressive ratio test for food motivation. A marked impairment in object recognition was found. The 5,7-DHT treatment did not affect the corticosterone response to a stressful situation. Overall, these results corroborate studies with acute tryptophan depletion suggesting a role of 5-HT in object memory, but not affective behavior."
"Mice exhibiting deficits in social behavior may provide valuable models for autistic-like behavioral problems. We tested social interactions in male mice from three inbred strains: C57BL/6J (B6), BALB/cJ (C) and DBA/2J (D2). All three strains showed gradual habituation of the number of social interactions with an ovariectomized female over four subsequent 2min sessions, returning to initial levels when presented with another stimulus mouse. Next, we studied males with a knockout mutation in the Fmr1 gene on a B6 background. KO animals showed strongly reduced levels of social interaction, which were about similar as those of habituated controls. This social behavior deficit suggests that Fmr1 KO mice could possibly be used as models for autistic behaviors."
"According to the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia, early brain damage renders the brain vulnerable to adverse effects during puberty, which precipitate the disease in young adults. Animal models can be used to test this hypothesis. We investigated the potentially independent or interactive effects of neonatal (postnatal day 7) excitotoxic lesions of the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and subchronic pubertal phencyclidine (PCP)-treatment on adult rat behaviour. Sham-lesioned (vehicle-injection) and naive (unoperated) rats served as controls. On postnatal days 42-48 rats were systemically injected with 5 mg/kg PCP or vehicle twice daily. Behavioural testing started at postnatal day 70. Rats were tested for locomotor activity (open field), anxiety (elevated plus maze), social behaviour (conditioned place preference for cage-mates), reward-related operant behaviour [progressive ratio (PR)] and spatial learning (four-arm baited eight-arm radial maze task). Nissl-stained sections revealed considerable regeneration of much of the lesioned tissue in the mPFC, however, with disturbed cytoarchitecture. Locomotor activity was increased by neonatal lesions but reduced after pubertal PCP-treatment. Neonatal lesions alone increased operant behaviour in the PR-test and reduced anxiety in the elevated plus maze. In contrast, PCP-treatment disturbed social behaviour while neonatal lesions had no effect. Different aspects of leaning and memory in the radial maze task were independently disturbed after neonatal lesions and PCP-treatment. Neonatal lesions and pubertal PCP-treatment differentially affected adult rat behaviour and no interactions were found."
"The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of pharmacological modulation of the NMDA receptors on spontaneous alternation behaviour. The performance of rats treated with MK-801 and kynurenic acid (KYNA) was assessed in the cross-arm-maze. We evaluated: (a) the total number of arm entries representing locomotor activity, (b) spontaneous variation of different arms thought to reflect alternation performance. In the first experiment, MK-801 (0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg, i.p.) was given 30 min prior to the testing. Beginning the dose of 0.05 mg/kg the drug increased locomotion and impaired alternation performance. An ability of animals to enter subsequently three or four different arms was reduced significantly. In the second experiment, the dose of 0.05 mg/kg was chosen as the lowest possible dose of MK-801 producing marked behavioural impairment. KYNA (0.3, 3 and 30 mg/kg, s.c.) was administered 60 min prior to the MK-801. While all KYNA doses prevented hyperlocomotion, only the highest dose (30 mg/kg) maintained alternation score at the control levels, i.e. the KYNA plus MK-801 treated animals alternated regularly three or four different arms. The results suggest different sensitivity of the two behavioural systems, i.e. locomotion and space orientation, towards pharmacological insult. In conclusion, the study confirmed protective behavioural effects of KYNA given in sufficient amounts and sufficiently long prior MK-801."
"Warming from hibernation to cenothermia involves intense metabolic activity coincident with large fluxes in blood flow and is considered to be a period of oxidative stress during which utilization of endogenous antioxidants prevents pathology. Very slow flow brain microdialysis enabled temperature independent sampling of the brain striatal extracellular fluid (ECF) during hibernation, arousal and cenothermia in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Brain tissue and dialysates were analyzed to provide the first profile of changes in ECF levels of ascorbate (AA), glutathione (GSH) and urate during hibernation and the transition to cenothermia. Brain tissue content of AA and GSH was unchanged between hibernation and cenothermia; however, arousal was associated with substantial oxidation of AA from the brain ECF and plasma compartments. ECF GSH increased during arousal. Brain tissue urate content was decreased 50% during hibernation. ECF urate levels were unchanged in hibernation and cenothermia but transiently increased 100% during arousal. These experiments demonstrate that arousal from hibernation is a suitable experimental model for examination of the mechanisms by which non-pathological tissue integrity is maintained in the face of the generation of free radicals during increasing metabolism, temperature and cerebral reperfusion."
"Two experiments were conducted to examine the human ability to adapt to a perturbation in a synchronization task. Five experimental signal conditions were tested using random-dot kinematograms, representing four conditions with different coherence levels (100%, 50%, 30% and 10%) and one target-alone condition. Within one trial, increasing or decreasing the frequency of the sinusoidally moving signal dots abruptly in the midst of each trial provoked a perturbation. The first experiment was aimed to clarify the process of adaptation to the new frequency situation. The second experiment explored the role of visual feedback about the arm's position on the participants' ability to adapt after the perturbation had occurred. The results clearly demonstrated that the synchronization performance gradually declined in function of the increasing number of randomly moving noise dots. In the 50% coherence condition, the participants were not or only partially able to adjust their arm movements to the new frequency situation. In addition, the provision of enhanced visual feedback about the arm's failed to improve one's adaptive ability. In general, these findings provided evidence for the important role of perceptual constraints on perception-action coupling in this type of synchronization task."
"Competition for palatable food or fluids within groups of rats has been previously used to mirror intra-group ranking. The paradigm of competition for sucrose pellets in non-food-deprived male Wistar rats was here extended from triads to tetrads aiming at evaluating whether the number of poor-performing rats, those animals being likely to model aspects of human psychopathologies (anxiety/depression/social withdrawal), could be increased. To evaluate potential superiority over the previously used Wistar strain, establishment and stability of the ranking was also assessed in tetrads of male Fischer and Sprague-Dawley rats. Clear and stable rank orders were seen in around 60-70% of both triads and tetrads of Wistar rats: a high-performing, a medium-performing and one (in triads) or two (in tetrads) poor-performing rats were identifiable, indicating that the number of poor-performing rats had increased in tetrads. Comparable rank orders were also seen in tetrads of Fischer and Sprague-Dawley rats. At the end of an extended period of repeated testing, tetrads of these two strains, as well as some selected Wistar tetrads, were tested in the elevated zero-maze and plasma corticosterone levels were determined. The differentiation in competition-performance among cage mates was not paralleled by a difference in performance in the elevated zero-maze or in plasma corticosterone levels in any of the three strains. These data indicate that the level of anxiety in a non-social paradigm, the elevated zero-maze, does not reflect the competition-performance within the home cage and thus, the dominant/subordinate status in this food-competition paradigm may not reflect/being caused by different levels of anxiety."
"Neuropeptide-Y (NPY) is involved in the regulation of ingestive behaviour and energy homeostasis. Since deletion of the NPY Y2 and Y4 receptor gene increases and decreases food intake, respectively, we examined whether water intake during the light and dark phases is altered in Y2 and Y4 receptor knockout mice. The water consumption of mice staying in their home cages was measured by weighing the water bottles at the beginning and end of the light phase during 4 consecutive days. Control, Y2 and Y4 receptor knockout mice did not differ in their water intake during the light phase. However, during the dark phase Y2 and Y4 receptor knockout mice drank significantly more (46-63%, P&lt;0.05) water than the control mice. The total daily water intake over 24 h was also enhanced. The enhanced water intake during the dark phase was not altered by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol or the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist telmisartan (each injected intraperitoneally at 10 mg/kg). These data indicate that NPY acting via Y2 and Y4 receptors plays a distinctive role in the regulation of nocturnal water consumption. While beta-adrenoceptors and angiotensin AT1 receptors do not seem to be involved, water intake in Y2 and Y4 receptor knockout mice may be enhanced because presynaptic autoinhibition of NPY release and inhibition of orexin neurons in the central nervous system are prevented."
"Quetiapine, a new atypical antipsychotic drug, effectively alleviates positive and negative symptoms, as well as cognitive impairment that may be caused by neurodegeneration, in schizophrenia patients. Earlier in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that quetiapine may be a neuroprotectant. The present study was designed to examine the beneficial effects of quetiapine on the possible cognitive impairment and changes of brain apoptotic regulation proteins induced by phencyclidine (PCP) in rats. Rats were treated with quetiapine (10 mg/kg/day; intraperitoneal (i.p.)) or vehicle for 16 days. On day 14, 1 h after the administration of quetiapine, the rats were given PCP (50 mg/kg; subcutaneous (s.c.)) or vehicle. Then quetiapine was administrated for an additional 2 days. One day after the last quetiapine injection (3 days after the PCP injection), the rats were trained on a spatial memory task in a radial arm maze. After the behavioural test, the rats were decapitated for Western blot analysis. PCP induced reference memory impairment, and a decrease of the ratio of an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member (Bcl-XL) to a pro-apoptotic analogue (Bax) in the posterior cingulate cortex. Chronic administration of quetiapine counteracted the PCP-induced reference memory impairment and decrease of Bcl-XL/Bax ratio in the posterior cingulate cortex. These results suggest that quetiapine may have ameliorating effects on the cognitive impairment and brain apoptotic processes induced by PCP."
"In this study we examined whether expression of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) after transient global cerebral ischemia can be influenced by behavioral experience and if the changes are associated with functional improvement. Rats received either ischemia or sham surgery then assigned to: complex environment housing (EC) or social housing (SC) as controls for 14 days followed by water maze testing. Upregulation of MAP2 was seen in all ischemic animals with a significant overall increase evident in the EC housed rats. Behaviorally, all animals learned to perform the water maze task over time but the ischemia SC rats had the worst performance overall while all the EC housed animals demonstrated the best performance in general. Regression analysis showed that increase MAP2 expression was able to explain some of the variance in the behavioral parameters in the water maze suggesting that this cytoskeletal protein probably played a role in mediating enhanced functional outcomes."
"The effect of ritanserin (5-HT2 antagonist) on scopolamine (muscarinic cholinergic antagonist)-induced amnesia in Morris water maze (MWM) was investigated. Rats were divided into eight groups and bilaterally cannulated into CA1 region of the hippocampus. One week later, they received repeatedly vehicles (saline, DMSO, saline+DMSO), scopolamine (2 microg/0.5 microl saline/side; 30 min before training), ritanserin (2, 4 and 8 microg/0.5 microl DMSO/side; 20 min before training) and scopolamine (2 microg/0.5 microl; 30 min before ritanserin injection)+ritanserin (4 microg/0.5 microl DMSO) through cannulae each day. Animals were tested for four consecutive days (4 trial/day) in MWM during which the position of hidden platform was unchanged. In the fifth day, the platform was elevated above the water surface in another position to evaluate the function of motor, motivational and visual systems. The results showed a significant increase in escape latencies and traveled distances to find platform in scopolamine-treated group as compared to saline group. Ritanserin-treated rats (4 microg/0.5 microl/side) showed a significant decrease in the mentioned parameters as compared to DMSO-treated group. However, scopolamine and ritanserin co-administration resulted in a significant decrease in escape latencies and traveled distances as compared to the scopolamine-treated rats. Our findings show that microinjection of ritanserin into the CA1 region of the hippocampus improves the scopolamine-induced amnesia."
"In walking quadrupeds the alternating activity pattern of antagonistic leg muscles and the coordination between legs is orchestrated by central pattern generating networks within the spinal cord. These networks are activated by tonic input from the reticular formation in the brainstem. Under more challenging conditions, such as walking on a horizontal ladder, successful locomotion relies upon additional context dependent input from pathways such as the cortico- and rubro-spinal tracts. In this study we used electromyographic and kinematic approaches to characterize the adaptations in the walking pattern in adult uninjured rats crossing a horizontal ladder. We found that the placement of a hind limb on a rung precisely followed the placement of the ipsilateral fore limb. This is different to normal walking where the hind limb is placed behind the position of the ipsilateral fore limb. The increased reach of the hind limbs is achieved by increased flexion of the hip and rotation of the pelvis during the swing phase. Electromyographic observations showed decreased burst duration in Tibialis anterior an ankle flexor muscle. Further changes in the muscle activity pattern were likely due to the reduced stepping frequency during ladder walking. Following a lesion of the dorsal column, containing major parts of the corticospinal tract, we found an increased number of stepping errors and changes in the stepping strategy. The step length of the fore limbs was reduced and the hind limbs were frequently positioned on rungs other than those occupied by the fore limb."
"Stress is recognized to precipitate depressive illness, yet the specific relationship between stress, glucocorticoids and depression is not well understood. We have recently shown that repeated corticosterone (CORT) injections reliably increase depression-like behavior on the forced-swim test in rats, suggesting that glucocorticoids can precipitate depressive symptomatology. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the extent to which the effects of CORT on depression-like behavior depend on (1) the dose-injected and (2) the duration of treatment. Rats received either acute or repeated injections of vehicle, 10, 20 or 40 mg/kg of CORT, and then were subjected to the forced-swim test. Serum CORT levels were assessed after the 21-day injection period, and 30 and 60 min after the onset of forced-swim testing. Repeated, but not acute, CORT injections decreased body weight and increased immobility behavior in the forced-swim test in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, all doses of repeated CORT injections suppressed CORT release after the novel stress of forced-swim testing. Our results demonstrate that glucocorticoids increase depression-like behavior in rats in a dose-dependent manner and disrupt normal HPA axis function. These results support the hypothesis that high levels of cortisol contribute to the etiology of depressive symptomatology in humans."
"This study used a matching-to-position schedule of reinforcement to examine working memory in Ts65Dn and littermate control mice. Initially there appeared to be a memory deficit in the Ts65Dn mice, which disappeared with extended practice. Thus, what appeared as a memory deficit may actually be the result of a delay in learning the concept of matching. These results suggest that delayed learning may be an important factor in other procedures examining working memory in Ts65Dn mice and have important implications for clinical treatment of Down syndrome patients."
"Conditioned inhibition is demonstrated when the meaning of one signal (conditioned stimulus, CS) is qualified by another (conditioned inhibitor, CI). Whilst the CS presented alone reliably predicts the outcome (unconditioned stimulus, US), when presented in conjunction with the CI the otherwise expected US will not occur. Conditioned inhibition has long been established in animal research but there have been difficulties in establishing reliable procedures suitable for use in human research. Such procedures are necessary to investigate disorders in which cognitive inhibitory mechanisms are known to be deficient, e.g., schizophrenia. In healthy participants, individual differences in the tendency to show conditioned inhibition should be related to personality measures of cognitive inhibition. In the present study, this was measured using an automated test procedure, in which visual stimuli predict the occurrence or non-occurrence of a visual outcome US, and BIS/BAS and schizotypy scales. Conditioned inhibition was reliable across two alternative test variants, in which the non-occurrence of the US was specified differently, and was confirmed by summation tests. The level of CI shown was positively associated with BAS Reward Responsiveness but did not correlate significantly with any of the other BIS/BAS scales. Conversely, the level of CI shown was negatively associated with schizotypy. We suggest that this novel conditioned inhibition task should now be applied to investigate a range of disorders that have some basis in dysfunctional inhibitory processes, such as schizophrenia."
"Smoking marijuana causes working and short-term memory deficits, an effect that is mediated by cannabinoid receptor (CB1) activation in the brain. While this may be due to the main psychoactive constituent Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta9-THC), plant extracts also contain other cannabinoid and terpenoid compounds with unknown properties. Towards this end, we have recently shown that high concentrations of plant extracts rich in cannabidiol (CBD) can reverse working memory deficits induced by Delta9-THC which is a remaining contaminant of this extract [Fadda P, Robinson L, Fratta W, Pertwee RG, Riedel G. Differential effects of THC- and CBD-rich cannabis-extracts on working memory in rats. Neuropahrmacology 2004;47:1170-9]. Since this effect was dose-dependent and indicative of memory enhancing qualities of the CBD-rich extract, this prompted a wider investigation into the effects of CBD on other forms of amnesia in order to determine the mechanism of action and to reveal its potency against anticholinergic and antiglutamatergic agents. We employed a spatial delayed matching to position task in the open-field water maze. Both scopolamine (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) and dizocilpine (MK801: 0.1mg/kg i.p.) impaired working memory at delays of 30 s and 4 h. Two doses of CBD-rich extracts (5 and 10 mg/kg), which did not affect working memory when given alone, were unable to reverse these deficits when co-administered with scopolamine or MK801. These data suggest that reversal of working memory deficits by CBD-rich extracts are specific to the cannabinoid system and do not compensate for acutely induced cholinergic or glutamatergic receptor hypoactivity."
"This study investigated the involvement of the L-arginine-nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway in the antidepressant-like effect of an acute administration of memantine in the forced swimming test (FST) in mice, since this signaling pathway is supposed to play a significant role in depression. The antidepressant-like effect of memantine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) was prevented by pretreatment with L-arginine (750 mg/kg, i.p.) or S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP, 25 microg/site, i.c.v.), but not with d-arginine (750 mg/kg, i.p.).The treatment of mice with NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) potentiated the effect of a subeffective dose of memantine (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) in the FST. Moreover, the pretreatment of mice with (1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazole[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one) (ODQ, 30 pmol/site, i.c.v.) produced a synergistic antidepressant-like effect with subeffective doses of memantine (0.3 and 1 mg/kg, i.p.) in the FST. Furthermore, the reduction in the immobility time elicited by memantine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) in the FST was prevented by pretreatment with sildenafil (5 mg/kg, i.p.). Taken together, the results demonstrate that memantine produced an antidepressant-like effect in the FST that seems to be mediated through an interaction with the L-arginine-NO-cGMP pathway."
"Male 129T2 and C57BL/6J mice were housed either in groups of three (socials) or singly (isolates) at weaning. Six and seven weeks later, prepulse inhibition (PPI), startle reactivity, and locomotor activity (LMA) were measured. Isolation-reared mice of both strains exhibited PPI deficits compared to socially reared controls in at least one of the two PPI test sessions. Isolation rearing had no effect on startle reactivity or habituation and only 129T2 isolates exhibited increased LMA. Isolation rearing induced locomotor hyperactivity and PPI deficits in mice and may be an effective developmental manipulation to use in combination with studies of genetically altered mice."
"Injection of increasing concentrations of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) can be used to establish a graded model of different clinical stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated the relationship between behavioural alterations and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Forty female Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with either (i) 4 microg (ii) 8 microg or (iii) 16 microg 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to mimic the preclinical, mild and advanced clinical stages of PD, respectively. Vehicle was injected in a separate control group. Behaviours analysed included postural asymmetry, balance, locomotion, sensorimotor deficits and apomorphine rotation. At post-mortem the degree of tyrosine immunoreactive dopaminergic cell (TH-ir) loss was then estimated. There was a graded and consistent trend in each of the behaviours studied with respect to cell loss between the different sized lesion groups when examined using correlation analysis (all comparisons, r &gt; 0.8, p &lt; 0.001). Rats with large lesions demonstrated more significant behavioural changes over 8 weeks of testing than those with intermediate and smaller lesions (group comparisons p &lt; 0.001). PD symptomatology became overt when cell loss reached 70%, however some significant changes can be observed with as little as 40% dopaminergic cell loss. Thus, injection with increasing concentrations 6-OHDA into the MFB can produce increasing extents of cell loss and behavioural changes, which were well correlated. This graded model can be useful for testing potential neuroprotective compounds for PD."
"Gray and McNaughton [Gray JA, McNaughton N. The neuropsychology of anxiety. Oxford: Oxford University Press; 2000] predict that fear is associated with orientation away from threat whereas anxiety is associated with orientation towards threat; this first dimension of 'defensive direction' is independent of a second dimension of 'defensive intensity'. Defensive reactions were measured using a threat scenario questionnaire developed by Blanchard et al. [Blanchard DC, Hynd AL, Minke KA, Minemoto T, Blanchard RJ. Human defensive behaviours to threat scenarios show parallels to fear- and anxiety-related defence patterns of non-human mammals. Neurosci Biobehav Rev 2001;25:761-70] who found that responses paralleled the defensive reactions of rodents faced with real threats. In a sample of 141 participants we replicated Blanchard et al.'s findings as well as confirming the Gray and McNaughton hypotheses. As predicted, trait anxiety was associated with a tendency to orientate towards threat. In addition, the personality trait of psychoticism (tough-mindedness) was related to defensive intensity with low scorers on psychoticism being more sensitive to threat in general and high scorers being more threat insensitive. A well-established personality measure of general punishment sensitivity, namely the Carver and White [Carver CS, White TL. Behavioural inhibition, behavioural activation, and affective responses to impending reward and punishment: the BIS/BAS scales. J Pers Soc Psychol 1994;67:319-33] BIS scale, was positively correlated with both defensive intensity and direction. These data indicate that the threat scenario questionnaire has some validity as a measure of human reactions to threat."
"The present study was designed to evaluate the motor effects of lesioning the internal globus pallidus in an animal model of Parkinson's disease. Fourty rats were divided into four groups (each of 10 rats) which received either unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the medial forebrain bundle (mfb) plus sham surgery to the pallidum, sham surgery of mfb plus N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) induced pallidal lesions, combined 6-OHDA mfb + NMDA pallidal lesions or sham surgery to both structures. Animals with 6-OHDA lesions developed significant ipsilateral biases in head position, body axis and circling after amphetamine challenge (all P &lt; 0.05). Prominent contralateral deficits were present in sensorimotor response latency and contralateral circling was induced by apomorphine challenge (both P &lt; 0.05). The addition of an NMDA pallidal lesion, improved the head position and body axis biases, as well as dopamine-agonist induced rotation and contralateral reaction time in a sensorimotor task (all P &lt; 0.05). There was, however, a slight worsening of sensorimotor response on the ipsilateral side (P &lt; 0.05). Pallidal lesions in the absence of 6-OHDA lesions produced contralateral head position and body axis biases (both P &lt; 0.05). These data indicate that pallidotomy improves some, but not all aspects of parkinsonian motor dysfunction in an animal model of Parkinson's disease (PD)."
"Pavlovian delay conditioning, in which a conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US) co-terminate, is thought to reflect non-declarative memory. In contrast, trace conditioning, in which the CS and US are temporally separate, is thought to reflect declarative memory. Hippocampal lesions impair acquisition and expression of trace conditioning measured by the conditioned freezing and eyeblink responses, while having little effect on the acquisition of delay conditioning. Recent evidence suggests that lesions of the ventral hippocampus (VH) impair conditioned fear under conditions in which dorsal hippocampal (DH) lesions have little effect. In the present study, we examined the time-course of fear expression after delay and trace conditioning using the fear-potentiated startle (FPS) reflex, and the effects of pre- and post-training lesions to the VH and DH on trace-conditioned FPS. We found that both delay- and trace-conditioned rats displayed significant FPS near the end of the CS relative to the unpaired control group. In contrast, trace-conditioned rats displayed significant FPS throughout the duration of the trace interval, whereas FPS decayed rapidly to baseline after CS offset in delay-conditioned rats. In experiment 2, both DH and VH lesions were found to significantly reduce the overall magnitude of FPS compared to the control group, however, no differences were found between the DH and VH groups. These findings support a role for both the DH and VH in trace fear conditioning, and suggest that the greater effect of VH lesions on conditioned fear might be specific to certain measures of fear."
"There is an urgent need to develop a reliable mouse model of relapse to address the genetic factors involved in susceptibility to relapse of drug-seeking behavior by using mutant mice. This paper presents a feasible way to reinstate extinguished methamphetamine (METH)-seeking behavior. Male C57BL/6J mice acquired stable nose-poking responses for taking METH after approximately 10 daily 3-h sessions of METH (0.1mg/kg/infusion) self-administration under a fixed ratio 1 or 2 (FR1/2) schedule. During the self-administration, cue- and hole-lamps indicated the availability of METH and were inactivated simultaneously with each infusion for 5s. The mice were exposed to extinction training in the absence of METH-paired stimuli (cue- and hole-lamps) and METH infusion, until they met the extinction criterion (less than 25 active responses or 30% of active responses in the stable self-administration phase on 2 consecutive days). METH-paired stimuli (cue- and hole-lamps) during METH self-administration reliably triggered a relapse of METH-seeking behavior in the absence of METH infusion. A combination of non-contingent intravenous (i.v.) priming and self-injected METH also increased the reinstatement of METH-seeking behavior in the absence of METH-paired stimuli (cue- and hole-lamps) and without METH infusion posterior to the self-injection. These results suggest that the mouse model of relapse in our study might provide a new stage for the exploration of genetic factors involved in relapse of drug dependence and of the underlying mechanisms of drugs of abuse."
"Developmental and social factors are known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of affective disorders. Although it has been demonstrated that early life aversive experiences can be a risk factor in the development of human depression, most of the investigation in animals that try to model depression do not include postnatal manipulations. Since housing represents a fundamental ethological factor which modifies behavior and brain development, this study aimed to investigate the impact of different social and structural housing conditions on the development of a depressive-like syndrome in the behavioral despair paradigm and an anxiety-like syndrome in the unconditioned anxiety paradigm. The present study uses several multivariate analyses to study the impact of housing conditions in animal models of depression and anxiety. In this study, social isolation was able to reproduce the effects found in other animals models based on stress, suggesting that only 2 months of social isolation are enough to produce effects that can be useful as behavioral model of depression. Moreover, environmental enrichment showed an antidepressive and anxiolytic like effect in animal models of depression and anxiety. This effect, which has not been reported in earlier studies, suggests that stimulation during the first stages of growth might play a ""protective"" role on behavior and brain development."
"We have reported that exposure to bacteria (Escherichia coli) during the neonatal period in rats is associated with impaired memory for a novel context in adulthood. However, impairment is only observed if a peripheral immune challenge (bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) is administered immediately following context exposure. The goal of the current study was to more fully characterize this phenomenon. In Experiment 1, memory impairment as a result of neonatal infection and subsequent LPS challenge was observed in juvenile rats, indicating that the changes induced by infection occur early on and are then manifest throughout the lifespan. In Experiment 2, infection in juvenile rats did not lead to LPS-induced memory impairment in adulthood, suggesting there is a critical period for early infection-induced alterations. In Experiments 3 and 4, memory for a novel context was impaired in neonatally infected rats, a task that is dependent on the hippocampus, whereas cued memory for a tone, which does not depend on the hippocampus, was not impaired. Furthermore, long-term, but not short-term contextual memory was impaired in adult rats infected as neonates following an LPS challenge either 24 h before or immediately after conditioning. Finally, in Experiment 5, no neonatal group differences were observed in corticosterone or open field behaviour, suggesting that decreased freezing to a conditioned context reflects impaired memory, and not simply hyperactivity or altered stress reactivity. Taken together, we have demonstrated that neonatal infection results in robust hippocampal-dependent memory impairment following an immune challenge in adulthood using a number of conditioning paradigms."
"Our previous studies have suggested that activation of the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) descending oxytocinergic projections is involved in the induction of yawning accompanied by an arousal response, but the possibility that neural systems other than the oxytocinergic system in the PVN also mediate the arousal/yawning response cannot be ruled out. We assessed the activity of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons during yawning induced by the PVN stimulation in anesthetized, spontaneously breathing rats using double-staining for c-Fos and CRF. Yawning response was evaluated by monitoring an intercostals electromyogram as an index of inspiratory activity and a digastric electromyogram as an indicator of mouth opening. We also recorded the electrocorticogram (ECoG) to determine the arousal response during yawning. Microinjection of l-glutamate (2-5 nmol) into the PVN produced a frequent yawning accompanied by an arousal shift in the ECoG, and these behavioral effects were associated with a significant increase of c-Fos positive CRF neurons in the medial parvocellular subdivision of the PVN. In addition, a marked enhancement in the c-Fos expression was found in the both locus coeruleus (LC) and global area in the cortex when the frequency of yawning response was increased by the PVN stimulation, suggesting that the arousal response during yawning might be mediated by the activation of LC neurons. The present study suggests that an activation of CRF neurons in the PVN is responsible for the arousal response accompanied by yawning behavior."
"How do we extrapolate the final position of hand trajectory that suddenly vanishes behind a wall? Studies showing maintenance of cortical activity after objects in motion disappear suggest that internal model of action may be recalled to reconstruct the missing part of the trajectory. Although supported by neurophysiological and brain imaging studies, behavioural evidence for this hypothesis is sparse. Further, in humans, it is unknown if the recall of internal model of action at motion observation can be tuned with kinematic features of movement. Here, we propose a novel experiment to address this question. Each stimulus consisted of a dot moving either upwards or downwards, and corresponding to vertical arm movements that were masked in the last part of the trajectory. The stimulus could either move according to biological and or non-biological kinematic laws of pointing tasks. We compared subjects' estimations of the stimulus vanishing or final positions after biological and after non-biological motion displays. Subjects systematically overestimated the vanishing and final position for the two directions (up and down) and the two kinematics displayed (biological and non-biological). However, estimation of the final position decreased in precision and increased in variability for movements that violated the kinematic laws of arm pointing task. The results suggest that motion inference does not rely only upon visual extrapolating mechanisms based on past visual trajectory information. We propose that motion estimation relies on internal models that contain specific kinematic details of vertical arm movement, which can be rapidly recalled during motion observation."
"Conditioned taste aversions (CTAs) can be established by exposing rats to a novel taste CS through a bottle or through intra-oral (IO) infusion. Lesion studies suggest differences between the two methods in their engagement of brain circuits, as excitotoxic amygdala lesions have no effect on bottle-conditioned CTAs, but eliminate CTAs produced using IO infusion. Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) was used to compare patterns of brain activation after pairing CS taste and US drug using bottle and IO methods. Conditioning rats using the bottle method was associated with widespread elevations in FLI throughout the putative CTA circuit (basolateral and central nuclei of amygdala, insular cortex and nucleus of the solitary tract). In contrast, IO conditioning led to activation only in the central nucleus of amygdala. This supports the suggestion of differences in aversion processing as a function of conditioning method and may explain the greater reliance on amygdala of IO-conditioned CTAs due to engagement of a less distributed neural network."
"This study examined the relationship between hippocampal place fields and spatial working memory. Place cells were recorded while rats solved a spatial working memory task in light and dark testing conditions. Rats made significantly more errors when tested in darkness, and although place fields changed in multiple ways in darkness, only changes in place field specificity predicted the degree of impaired spatial memory. This finding suggests that more spatially distinct place fields may contribute to hippocampal-dependent mnemonic functions."
"To maintain nutritional homeostasis, external food-related stimuli have to be evaluated in relation to the internal states of hunger or satiety. To examine the neural circuitry responsible for integration of internal and external determinants of human eating behaviour, brain responses to visual and complex gustatory food-related stimuli were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging in 18 healthy non-smokers (10 women, 8 men). Each individual was studied on two occasions, the order of which was counterbalanced; after eating as usual and after 24 h fasting. Raised plasma free fatty acids and lower insulin and leptin concentrations confirmed that participants fasted as requested. When fasted, participants reported more hunger, nervousness and worse mood and rated the visual (but not gustatory) food-related stimuli as more pleasant. The effect of fasting on hunger was stronger in women than in men. No circuitry was identified as differentially responsive in fasting compared to satiety to both visual and gustatory food-related stimuli. The left insula response to the gustatory stimuli was stronger during fasting. The inferior occipito-temporal response to visual food-related stimuli also tended to be stronger during fasting. The responses in the occipito-temporal cortex to visual and in the insula to gustatory stimuli were stronger in women than in men. There was no interaction between gender and fasting. In conclusion, food reactivity in modality-specific sensory cortical areas is modulated by internal motivational states. The stronger reactivity to external food-related stimuli in women may be explored as a marker of gender-related susceptibility to eating disorders."
"Neuronal mechanisms of the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebellum play a key role in the control of complex automatic motor behaviors-postural corrections, stepping, and scratching, whereas the role of the motor cortex is less clear. To assess this role, we recorded fore and hind limb-related pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) in the cat during postural corrections and during locomotion; hind limb PTNs were also tested during scratching. The activity of nearly all PTNs was modulated in the rhythm of each of these motor patterns. The discharge frequency, averaged over the PTN population, was similar in different motor tasks, whereas the degree of frequency modulation was larger during locomotion. In individual PTNs, a correlation between analogous discharge characteristics (frequency or its modulation) in different tasks was very low, suggesting that input signals to PTNs in these tasks have a substantially different origin. In about a half of PTNs, their activity in different tasks was timed to the analogous (flexor/extensor) parts of the cycle, suggesting that these PTNs perform similar functions in these tasks (e.g., control of the value of muscle activity). In another half of PTNs, their activity was timed to opposite parts of the cycle in different tasks. These PTNs seem to perform different motor functions in different tasks, or their targets are active in different parts of the cycle in these tasks, or their effects are not directly related to the control of motor output (e.g., they modulate transmission of afferent signals)."
"Perinatal manipulations can lead to neurobehavioural changes in the progeny. In this study we investigated, in adolescent male rat offspring, the consequences of a single, intense prenatal stress induced by a 120 min-maternal immobilization at gestational day 16, and of a daily, brief maternal separation from postnatal day 2 until 21, on: unconditioned fear/anxiety-like behaviour in open field and in elevated plus-maze; learning performance in the ""Can test"", a non-aversive spatial and tactile/visual task; corticosterone plasma levels under basal and stress-induced conditions. Our results indicate that both prenatal stress and maternal separation procedures decrease emotionality and enhance learning performance. Maternal separation potentiates prenatal stress-induced effects in enhancing learning performance. Both basal and stress-induced corticosterone plasma levels are reduced following prenatal stress, maternal separation and the combination of two procedures. These findings suggest that a single, intense prenatal stress can enhance the adaptive stress-related responses in the progeny, probably due to the involvement of maternal factors. The synergistic effect of prenatal stress and maternal separation on learning performance may be due to a further damping of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response in the progeny that better cope with the task administered."
"In the present study, the effects of post-training intra-dorsal hippocampal (intra-CA1) injection of an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist and competitive or noncompetitive antagonists, on memory retention of passive avoidance learning was measured in the presence and absence of physostigmine in rats. Intra-CA1 administration of lower doses of the NMDA receptor agonist NMDA (10(-5) and 10(-4) microg/rat) did not affect memory retention, although the higher doses of the drug (10(-3), 10(-2) and 10(-1) microg/rat) increased memory retention. The greatest response was obtained with 10(-1) microg/rat of the drug. The different doses of the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist DL-AP5 (1, 3.2 and 10 microg/rat) and noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (0.5, 1 and 2 microg/rat) decreased memory retention in rats dose dependently. Both competitive and noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists reduced the effect of NMDA (10(-2) microg/rat). In another series of experiments, intra-CA1 injection of physostigmine (2, 3 and 4 microg/rat) improved memory retention. Post-training co-administration of lower doses of NMDA (10(-5) and 10(-4) microg/rat) and physostigmine (1 microg/rat), doses which were ineffective when given alone, significantly improved the retention latency. The competitive and noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists, DL-AP5 and MK-801, decreased the effect of physostigmine (2 microg/rat). Atropine decreased memory retention by itself and potentiated the response to DL-AP5 and MK-801. In conclusion, it seems that both NMDA and cholinergic systems not only play a part in the modulation of memory in the dorsal hippocampus of rats but also have demonstrated a complex interaction as well."
"The involvement of MAPK pathways in retrieval was investigated in a situation where reactivation of memory was dissociated from its behavioural expression. In rats trained in a brightness avoidance discrimination task, exposure to the discriminative stimulus had behavioural and molecular consequences: a facilitation of the retention performance and a decrease in ERK phosphorylation in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, but not in the hippocampus. These results indicate that reactivation processes engage a down-regulation of ERK, possibly related to increases in glucocorticoids, in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex already known to be involved in emotional retrieval."
"Despite the compelling support for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors participation in learning and memory in mammal species, the molecular basis had been largely absent from any discussion of its mechanistic underpinnings. Here, we report that reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that there was a higher level of expression of the investigated 5-HT receptor mRNAs in autoshaping-trained relative to untrained groups. Actually, pharmacological na&#xef;ve untrained and autoshaping-trained rats showed significant differences, the latter groups expressing, in decreasing order, 5-HT1A &lt; 5-HT6 &lt; 5-HT4 &lt; or = 5-HT7 receptors mRNA in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. In order to determine more precisely mRNA expression and memory consolidation, we combined selective 5-HT7 receptors stimulation or blockade in the same animals, and brain areas individually analyzed. 5-HT7 receptors were strongly expressed in all the three brain areas of vehicle-trained rats relative to untrained group. The potential selective 5-HT7 receptor agonist AS 19 enhanced memory consolidation, attenuated mRNA receptors expression, and the facilitatory memory effect was reversed by SB-269970. Finally, pharmacological stimulation of 5-HT7 receptors reversed scopolamine- or dizocilpine-induced amnesia and receptor down-regulation."
"Various abiotic and social factors are hypothesized to influence sleep in primates. Chimpanzee sleeping behavior has been examined only in a limited fashion, both in the wild and in captivity. Previous research, however limited, has suggested that chimpanzee sleep is non-dynamic. This study used an objective behavioral model of sleep as a framework in which to test the hypothesis that changes in individual (age and sex) and environmental (temperature and humidity) factors influence sleep patterns in 20 captive chimpanzees. The nocturnal behavior of the subjects was recorded continuously using video cameras equipped with enhanced nighttime visibility connected to time-lapse videocassette recorders. Chimpanzees in this study slept 8.81 h per night, close to the averages reported for both industrialized and traditional human societies (7-9h), as opposed to that of previous chimpanzee studies (11-12h). Also, the idea that chimpanzees sleep in one continuous period with little to no nocturnal awakenings was also refuted. Captive chimpanzee sleep behavior was, in fact, dynamic and complex with frequent awakenings. Older chimpanzees slept longer, had higher sleep quality, and shorter nighttime disturbances than prime adult chimpanzees. Finally, ambient temperature and humidity affected sleep duration and quality. The results of this study reveal that chimpanzee sleep behaviors are complicated interactions between both intrinsic and extrinsic factors."
"In human parietal cortex, the retinal location of a just seen visual stimulus is updated from one hemisphere to the other, when a horizontal eye movement brings the representation of the stimulus into the opposite visual hemifield. The present study aimed to elucidate the time course of this process. Twelve subjects performed an updating task, in which a filled circle was shown before a horizontal saccade, requiring updating of stimulus location, and a control task without visual stimulation before the saccade. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) were recorded while subjects performed the tasks and LORETA source analysis was performed on event-related potential (ERP) components. ERP amplitudes were more positive in the updating condition in comparison to the control condition in two latency windows. An early positive wave starting at about 50 ms after saccade offset and originating in the posterior parietal cortex contralateral to saccade direction probably reflects the integration of saccade-related and visual information and thus the updating process. A shift of the representation of the to-be-updated stimulus to the opposite hemisphere is reflected in a later component starting approximately 400 ms after saccade offset, which is related to memory and originates in the PPC ipsilateral to saccade direction and thus contralateral to the spatial location of the updated visual stimulus."
"A delayed-match-to-sample for spatial location task was used to measure spatial pattern separation and working memory. On each trial, an object covered a baited food well in one of 15 spatial locations along a row of food wells perpendicular to the start box. Once the rat exited the start box, displaced the object to receive a food reward and then returned to the startbox, the same food well was then quickly re-baited, an identical object was positioned to cover the food well and another identical object was positioned in a different location along the row of food wells covering a different unbaited food well. On the ensuing choice phase, the animal was allowed to choose between the two objects. The object that covered the same food well as the object in the sample phase was the correct choice and the second foil object was the incorrect choice. Five spatial separations (15-105 cm) were randomly used to separate the correct object from the foil object during the choice phase. Once a preoperative criterion was met, each rat received bilateral intracranial infusions of either ibotenic acid or the vehicle into the CA3 subregion of the dorsal hippocampus. Following surgery, rats with CA3 lesions were significantly impaired relative to controls across all spatial separations suggesting that CA3 lesions impaired working memory. Although the dorsal CA3 subregion of the hippocampus may play a role in pattern separation, the data suggest that this region is critically involved in spatial working memory."
"Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder, caused by an expanded polyglutamine region of a protein called huntingtin with unknown function. Transgenic mice expressing the N-terminal of huntingtin, containing 82 glutamines, exhibit a progressive disorder, which resembles to the human disease. In this study, we tested the longitudinal behaviour changes in this transgenic line in open-field and elevated-plus-maze tests. The motor performance deteriorated at 12 weeks of age and the disease progressed as indicated by the decreased total distance covered, the decreased mean velocity and the decreased exploratory behaviour. The level of anxiety was unchanged in transgenic mice as compared with their littermate controls. The motor deterioration was similar to that in other Huntington's disease models, while the level of anxiety was different. These tests are suitable means of following the progression of the disease and useful for studies of the effects of therapeutic interventions."
"A weakly reinforced variant of the single trial passive avoidance task developed for the day-old chick typically fails to consolidate long-term memory. However, administration of zaprinast, a phosphodiesterase (PDE) type 5 inhibitor, (ic; 10 microl/side) immediately post-training resulted in a dose-dependent increase in retention at test 180 min post-training. Further, 100 microM zaprinast resulted in high levels of retention at test 180 min post-training when administered from 10 min before training to 10 min after training. Finally, 100 microM zaprinast, when administered immediately post-training, resulted in the consolidation of long-term memory at a number of times of test extending as late as 24 h post-training. Inhibition of PDE type 5 is known to increase cellular cGMP levels. Previous investigations using a strongly reinforced variant of this task have suggested a role for cGMP in memory retrieval, we now postulate that cGMP is also necessary for memory formation in chicks trained using passive avoidance."
"Lewis (LEW) and Fischer (F344) rat strains differ on a number of physiological characteristics, such as hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, as well as on behavioral tasks, including those that measure impulsivity and drug reward. Since autoshaping, the phenomenon where animals approach and contact reward-paired conditioned stimuli, has been linked to HPA axis functioning, impulsivity and drug taking, the present study compared LEW and F344 rats on the rate of acquisition and performance of the autoshaping response. Rats were trained on an autoshaping procedure where insertions of one retractable lever (CS(+)) were paired response-independently with food, while insertions of another lever (CS(-)) were not paired with food. LEW rats acquired the autoshaping response more rapidly and also performed the autoshaping response at a higher rate than F344 rats. No differences between the strains were observed when rats were trained on a discrimination reversal where the CS(+) and CS(-) levers were reversed or during a negative auto-maintenance phase where CS(+) lever contacts cancelled food delivery. Potential physiological mechanisms that might mediate the present results, including strain differences in HPA axis and monoamine neurotransmitter activity, are discussed. The finding that LEW (as compared to F344 rats) more readily acquire autoshaping and perform more responses is consistent with research indicating that LEW rats behave more impulsively and more readily self-administer drugs of abuse."
"In the honey bee (Apis mellifera), young workers usually perform tasks in the nest while older workers forage in the field. The behavioral shift from nest-task to foraging activity is accompanied by physiological and sensory changes so that foragers can be characterized by a higher juvenile hormone (JH) level, a lower vitellogenin protein titer, and an increased responsiveness to water and sucrose stimuli. JH was hypothesized to be the key mediator of behavioral development, physiology, and sensory sensitivity in honey bee workers. Recent research, however, has shown that JH is controlled by the hemolymph vitellogenin level, which implies that the fat body specific vitellogenin gene can be a key regulator of behavioral change. Here, we show that downregulation of vitellogenin activity by RNA interference (RNAi) causes an increase in the gustatory responsiveness of worker bees. Our observations suggest that vitellogenin is an important regulator of long-term changes in honey bee behavior."
"Inbred Wistar-Kyoto rats consistently display hypoactivity in tests of emotional behavior. We used them to test the hypothesis that the genetic factors underlying the behavioral decision-making process will vary in different environmental contexts. The contexts used were the open-field test (OFT), a novel environment with no explicit threats present, and the defensive-burying test (DB), a habituated environment into which a threat has been introduced. Rearing, a voluntary behavior was measured in both tests, and our study was the first to look for genetic loci affecting grooming, a relatively automatic, stress-responsive stereotyped behavior. Quantitative trait locus analysis was performed on a population of 486 F2 animals bred from reciprocal inter-crosses. The genetic architectures of DB and OFT rearing, and of DB and OFT grooming, were compared. There were no common loci affecting grooming behavior in both tests. These different contexts produced the stereotyped behavior via different pathways, and genetic factors seem to influence the decision-making pathways and not the expression of the behavior. Three loci were found that affected rearing behavior in both tests. However, in both contexts, other loci had greater effects on the behavior. Our results imply that environmental context's effects on decision-making vary depending on the category of behavior."
"The cholinergic system is involved in cognition and several forms of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, and nicotine administration has been shown to improve cognitive performance in both humans and rodents. While experiments with humans have shown that nicotine improves the ability to handle an increasing working memory load, little work has been done in animal models evaluating nicotine effects on performance as working memory load increases. In this report, we demonstrate that in aged rats nicotine improved the ability to handle an increasing working memory load as well as enhanced performance on the reference memory component of the water radial arm maze task. The dose required to exert these effects (0.3mg/kg/day) was much lower than doses shown to be effective in young rats and appears to be a lower maintenance dose than is seen in light to moderate smokers. In addition, our study reports a nicotine-induced reduction in nerve growth factor (NGF) protein levels in the hippocampus of the aged rat. The effects of nicotine on hippocampal NGF levels are discussed as a potential mechanism of nicotine-induced improvements in working and reference memory."
"Brain abnormalities are found in association with antisocial personality disorder and schizophrenia, the two mental disorders most implicated in violent behaviour. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate the whole brain, cerebellum, temporal lobe, lateral ventricles, caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala and the prefrontal, pre-motor, sensorimotor, occipito-parietal regions in 13 men with antisocial personality disorder, 13 men with schizophrenia and a history of violence, 15 men with schizophrenia without violent history and 15 healthy non-violent men. Compared to controls, the antisocial personality disorder group displayed reductions in whole brain volume and temporal lobe as well as increases in putamen volume. Both schizophrenia groups regardless of violence history exhibited increased lateral ventricle volume, while the schizophrenia group with violent history showed further abnormalities including reduced whole brain and hippocampal volumes and increased putamen size. The findings suggest that individuals with antisocial personality disorder as well as those with schizophrenia and a history of violence have common neural abnormalities, but also show neuro-anatomical differences. The processes by which they came to apparently common ground may, however, differ. The finding of temporal lobe reductions prevalent among those with antisocial personality disorder and hippocampal reduction in the violent men with schizophrenia contributes support for the importance of this region in mediating violent behaviour."
"In the present study, the effects of repeated intra nucleus accumbens (intra-NAc) injections of dopamine receptor agents on morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats were investigated by using an unbiased 3-days schedule of place conditioning design. The animals receiving once daily subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of morphine (0.5-7.5mg/kg) or saline (1.0 ml/kg, s.c.) showed a significant place preference in a dose-dependent manner. The maximum response was observed with 5mg/kg of the opioid. Three days intra-NAc injections of apomorphine (0.5 and 1 microg/rat) followed by 5 days free of the drug, increased or decreased, respectively CPP induced by the lower dose of morphine (0.5mg/kg, s.c.). Morphine-induced CPP was also significantly increased in the animals that had previously received the 3-days intra-NAc injections of SKF 38393 (4 and 8 microg/rat) or quinpirole (2 and 4 microg/rat, intra-NAc). The CPP induced by a higher dose of morphine (5mg/kg, s.c.) was significantly decreased in the animals that had previously received the 3-days SCH 23390 (0.005 and 0.01 microg/rat; intra-NAc). On the other hand, the CPP induced by morphine (5mg/kg, s.c.) was significantly increased in the animals that had previously received the 3-days sulpiride administration (5 microg/rat, intra-NAc). The 3-days administration of apomorphine, SKF 38393 or quinpirole, but not SCH 23390 and sulpiride reduced the locomotor activity in the test session. It is concluded that repeated injections of dopamine receptors agents followed by 5 days free of the drugs in the NAc can affect morphine reward."
"This study aimed at investigating the effects of environmental enrichment on various aspects of contextual processing in adult female rats. In experiment 1, simple conditioning was studied using either a training procedure allowing overshadowing of the contextual cues by signalling footshock with a discrete tone or a training procedure allowing a reduction of this overshadowing by explicitly unpairing the footshock and the tone. In experiment 2, contextual discrimination and contextual occasion-setting were assessed. Rats were daily exposed to two different contexts. In one context, a footshock was delivered 30s after the offset of a tone, whereas in the other context the same tone was presented alone. Experiment 3 examined familiarization to a new context. Experiment 1 showed that environmental enrichment reduced the overshadowing of contextual cues by the tone and also reduced freezing to the more predictive cue according to the training procedure used. Experiment 2 showed that environmental enrichment increased the ability of rats to discriminate two contexts. Experiment 3 showed that enriched rats familiarized faster to a new context than standard rats. Taken together, these results suggest that environmental enrichment in adult rats enhances learning about contextual cues and reduces overall fear associated with aversive events."
"The corridor test is a newly developed test of sensorimotor integration that depends on a rat's ability to retrieve food from either side of its body. Rats with unilateral dopamine-depleting lesions neglect food on the contralateral side of their bodies, and selectively retrieve from the ipsilateral side. In the present study, the time-course for development of this deficit after injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the striatum is determined using the corridor test. The ability of the dopamine receptor agonist, apomorphine, to reverse this impairment is also assessed. Lesioned rats developed an impairment in contralateral retrieval that was evident within a day (and stable for up to 2 weeks) after lesion surgery. Systemic injection of apomorphine significantly ameliorated this deficit, and restored the rats' ability to collect food from both sides of their bodies. This study confirms that the corridor test is highly sensitive to dysfunction of the nigrostriatal dopamine system, and suggests that it might be a useful tool for screening pharmacological approaches to the treatment of Parkinson's disease."
"In this study stereotaxic injections of the vasoconstrictive peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) were used to create infarcts in the white matter of the internal capsule underlying sensorimotor cortex in rats. Resulting deficits were assessed using established sensorimotor tests conducted on each rat before and after the ET-1-induced infarct. After a 14-day survival period, histological examination revealed tissue necrosis and demyelination in the infarcted white matter of ET-1-injected rats, but not saline-injected control rats. Infarcts resulted in measurable sensorimotor deficits in rats that received ET-1 injections. The same sensorimotor tests showed no deficits in surgical-control rats. The present model of white matter infarct should be valuable in examining the underlying mechanisms of subcortical ischemic stroke and to evaluate potential therapeutic interventions."
"In aged rodents, neuronal plasticity decreases while spatial learning and working memory (WM) deficits increase. As it is well known, rats reared in enriched environments (EE) show better cognitive performances and an increased neuronal plasticity than rats reared in standard environments (SE). We hypothesized that EE could preserve the aged animals from cognitive impairment through NO dependent mechanisms of neuronal plasticity. WM performance and plasticity were measured in 27-month-old rats from EE and SE. EE animals showed a better spatial WM performance (66% increase) than SE ones. Cytosolic NOS activity was 128 and 155% higher in EE male and female rats, respectively. Mitochondrial NOS activity and expression were also significantly higher in EE male and female rats. Mitochondrial NOS protein expression was higher in brain submitochondrial membranes from EE reared rats. Complex I activity was 70-80% increased in EE as compared to SE rats. A significant increase in the area of NADPH-d reactive neurons was observed in the parietotemporal cortex and CA1 hippocampal region of EE animals."
"The cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist SR 141716A (0.1, 0.5 and 1 microg) induces penile erection when injected into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus of male rats. The pro-erectile effect of SR 141716A occurs concomitantly with an increase in the concentration of glutamic acid in the paraventricular dialysate obtained by means of intra-cerebral microdialysis. Glutamic acid increase and penile erection did not occur when SR 141716A was given after tetrodotoxin, a voltage-dependent Na(+) channel blocker. Both penile erection and glutamic acid increases were also reduced by the cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonists WIN 55,212-2 or HU 210 given into the paraventricular nucleus before SR 141716A at doses unable to induce penile erection or to modify glutamic acid. In contrast, dizocilpine ((+)MK-801), an antagonist of excitatory amino acid receptors of the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) subtype, given into the paraventricular nucleus reduced penile erection, but was ineffective on the glutamic acid increase induced by the CB1 receptor antagonist. 6-Cyano-7-nitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and (+/-)-2-amino-4-phosphono-butanoic acid (AP(4)), antagonists of the excitatory amino acid receptors of the AMPA subtype and of the metabotropic subtype, respectively, were ineffective on both penile erection and glutamic acid increase. SR 141716A responses were also reduced by muscimol, a GABA(A) receptor agonist, but not by baclofen, a GABA(B) receptor agonist, given into the paraventricular nucleus before SR 141716A. The present results show that SR 141716A induces penile erection by activating glutamic acid neurotransmission, which causes in turn the activation of paraventricular oxytocinergic neurons mediating penile erection."
"Male Swiss albinos mice were submitted to two behavioural tests intended to determine their anxiety level: the elevated plus-maze test as well as the black and white compartments test. In addition they were submitted to the hole-board test. It was observed: (i) that the correlation between scores in the two first tests was weak, suggesting that they explore different components of anxiety; (ii) that the score on the latter test was better correlated with the response in the elevated plus-maze test than in the black and white compartments test. From these data three groups of animals were constituted, considered, respectively, as anxious, non anxious and intermediates. It was observed that both horizontal and vertical locomotion in an unfamiliar environment differed between groups, with higher activity in non anxious than in anxious. In the hole-board test, only animals classified as anxious displayed an obvious response to the anxiolytic drug diazepam (0.5mg/kg). Finally in the forced-swimming test, the three groups demonstrated a similar immobility time, suggesting that the operated segregation was not depending on a helpless component. It is proposed that the selection of mice from a combination of either elevated plus-maze and black and white compartments tests or a combination of hole-board test and black and white compartments test, allows to distinguish high or low anxiety animals among a population of mice."
"Phencyclidine (PCP), an NMDA antagonist, has been shown to mimic some aspects of schizophrenia including positive, negative and cognitive symptoms. Previous studies in this laboratory have shown a selective reversal-learning deficit following acute PCP administration, a deficit that is attenuated by atypical, but not classical, antipsychotic treatment. However, acute PCP has limitations for modelling the chronic psychotic illness and persistent cognitive deficits observed in many schizophrenic patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the cognitive deficit induced by PCP over a longer term using a previously established operant reversal-learning procedure. Moreover, the efficacy of the atypical antipsychotics clozapine, ziprasidone and olanzapine to reverse the sub-chronic PCP deficit was compared with that of the classical antipsychotics, haloperidol and chlorpromazine. Female hooded-Lister rats were trained to respond for food using an operant reversal-learning paradigm. When animals achieved criterion of 90% correct responding they were treated with PCP (2mg/kg) or vehicle twice daily for 7 days, and 7 days later tested for their cognitive ability. PCP induced a significant impairment in the reversal phase relative to the initial phase of the task. Acute ziprasidone (2.5mg/kg), olanzapine (1.5mg/kg) and clozapine (5mg/kg) produced a significant attenuation of the impairment induced by sub-chronic PCP in the reversal phase. In marked contrast to these effects, acute administration of the classical agents haloperidol (0.05 mg/kg) and chlorpromazine (2mg/kg) failed to significantly reverse the PCP-induced cognitive impairment. These data clearly demonstrate that sub-chronic PCP produces enduring and persistent cognitive deficits, effects that are significantly attenuated by atypical but not classical antipsychotics."
"The pattern of monocular/unihemispheric sleep (Mo-Un sleep) was studied behaviourally in male and female chicks after early post-hatching changes of the imprinting object. Chicks were reared with an imprinting object on day 1 post-hatching which was removed or changed on day 2. On day 1, time spent in binocular sleep (both eyes closed) was similar in male and female chicks, though the number of episodes was lower in females than in males. There was no eye-closure bias in the pattern of Mo-Un sleep (one eye shut and the other open) in chicks of both sexes. On day 2, chicks subjected to the removal of imprinting object showed less time and number of episodes of binocular sleep than control chicks and chicks subjected to changes of imprinting object. There was no eye-closure bias in control chicks whilst a significant bias for more right Mo-Un sleep was recorded in chicks after removal and changes of imprinting object of both sexes. It is suggested that the removal or changes of imprinting object would cause a decrease of binocular sleep and trigger processes associated to secondary imprinting involving the left hemisphere. The bias for more right Mo-Un sleep (right eye-closure) could be the by-product of consolidation processes of secondary imprinting memories in the left hemisphere and/or of more left eye-opening as a result of periodical awakening of right hemisphere to control the environment after a stressful condition such as the removal or change of imprinting object."
"Music has been suggested to have a beneficial effect on various types of performance in humans. However, the physiological and molecular mechanism of this effect remains unclear. We examined the effect of music exposure during the perinatal period on learning behavior in adult mice, and measured the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB), which play critical roles in synaptic plasticity. In addition, we measured the levels of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), downstream targets of two main pathways in BDNF/TrkB signaling. Music-exposed mice completed a maze learning task with fewer errors than the white noise-exposed mice and had lower levels of BDNF and higher levels of TrkB and PDK1 in the cortex. MAPK levels were unchanged. Furthermore, TrkB and PDK1 protein levels in the cortex showed a significant negative correlation with the number of errors on the maze. These results suggest that perinatal exposure of mice to music has an influence on BDNF/TrkB signaling and its intracellular signaling pathway targets, including PDK1, and thus may induce improved learning and memory functions."
"Motion perception was tested in pigmented Long-Evans and albino Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus sp.) using moving random dot patterns. Pigmented as well as albino rats could distinguish a fully coherently moving pattern from dynamic noise. However, motion coherence thresholds were significantly lower in pigmented compared to albino rats (12% and 30% coherence, respectively). These results indicate that pigmented rats have well developed motion coherence perception, whereas albino rats are severely impaired but not motion blind."
"The present study investigated if NOS positive neurons localized in regions related to defensive reactions are activated after exposure to an innate fear stimulus (a live cat). Male Wistar rats were exposed to a live or a toy cat for 10 min and 2h later had their brains removed and processed for c-Fos immunohistochemistry (a marker of neuronal functional activation) and NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d; used to detect the presence of NOS neurons) histochemistry. Cat exposure induced a small (11%) to moderate (50%) significant increase in the percentage of double-stained cells (c-Fos+NADPH-d positive neurons) in the anteromedial bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BSTMA), medial amygdala (MeA), parvocellular paraventricular (pPVN), lateral (LH) and dorsal premammillary (PMd) hypothalamic nuclei, dorsolateral periaqueductal grey (dlPAG) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). This increase was attenuated in the PMd, DRN and dlPAG by i.c.v. injection of AP7 (5 nmol/2 microl), an NMDA receptor antagonist. The drug increased the percentage of time the rats remained close to the cat in the observation box. The results suggest that exposure to a live predator activates neurons containing NOS in brain areas related to defensive reactions. They also indicate that this effect probably involves activation of NMDA glutamate receptors."
"Lesions of the gustatory thalamus (GT) prevent the occurrence of between-session contrast effects (i.e., anticipatory negative contrast and consummatory successive negative contrast [cSNC]) involving liquid rewards. These deficits are attributed to a disruption of the reward comparison mechanism that computes the value of the current reward relative to the expected reward. Instrumental successive negative contrast (iSNC), which occurs following a surprising reduction in the magnitude of a solid food reward, is also keyed off the detection of a disparity between the value of the expected and actual rewards. The present study examined whether neurotoxic lesions of the GT prevent the occurrence of iSNC just as they abolish cSNC. In Experiment 1, both GT-lesioned and neurologically intact rats trained with 10 food pellets and shifted to one food pellet showed a significant iSNC effect. In Experiment 2, the same GT-lesioned rats failed to show cSNC when shifted from 1.0M sucrose to 0.15% sodium saccharin. The obtained pattern of results suggests that separate reward comparison mechanisms with different neural substrates underlie expression of cSNC and iSNC."
Slow potential shifts in brain structures have been recorded and correlated with motivational state in several species. Previous studies have also found that application of an electrical current to the surface of brain tissue generates such slow potential shifts. The present study was conducted to examine if imposed dc shifts to the brain influenced motivation in the toad (Bufo bufo). Toads (B. bufo) had stimulating electrodes implanted on the surface of each optic tectum. After 1 day of recovery combined dc stimuli and a prey-like visual stimulus were presented to the animal. A current-dependent increase in prey-catching activities occurred with dc currents from 0.1 to 500 micro A and in avoidance behaviours from 50 to 500 micro A. There is also evidence of additivity of dc and visually induced negativity increasing some behaviours. The dc current was applied in order to start a movement of ions through the brain structure but more specifically through radial glia. The resulting flux of ions is thought to be responsible for the recorded slow potential shift associated with motivation and these experiments hopefully shed further light on the possible neuromodulatory role played by radial glia through the spatial buffering of potassium and the associated slow potential shifts.
"A central premise of a number of theories of addiction is that discrete environmental stimuli repeatedly paired with drugs of abuse acquire incentive salience as a result of Pavlovian learning. There is, however, no unequivocal evidence supporting this assumption. Thus, we employed a Pavlovian conditioning procedure known to imbue non-drug reinforcers with incentive salience and extended it to study the effects of intravenous cocaine. Specifically, we examined whether a cue paired with intravenous cocaine administration would come to elicit approach towards it (sign-tracking), even if no behavioral response were required to receive the cue or drug. We found that when a cue was paired with intravenous cocaine delivery (but not when it was unpaired) rats came to approach and investigate the cue, and did so with increasing rapidity. We conclude that Pavlovian learning can imbue drug-paired cues with incentive salience, making them attractive and ""wanted"" stimuli. Delineating the neurobiological mechanisms responsible for this process will be important for understanding and treating drug addiction."
"Neuropeptide (NPY) Y2 receptors play an important role in some anxiety-related and stress-related behaviours in mice. Changes in the level of anxiety can affect some cognitive functions such as memory, attention and inhibitory response control. We investigated the effects of NPY Y2 receptor deletion (Y2(-/-)) in mice on visual attention and response control using the five-choice serial reaction time (5-CSRT) task in which accuracy of detection of a brief visual stimulus across five spatial locations may serve as a valid behavioural index of attentional functioning. Anticipatory and perseverative responses provide a measure of inhibitory response control. During training, the Y2(-/-) mice had lower accuracy (% correct), and made more anticipatory responses. At stimulus durations of 2 and 4s the Y2(-/-) were as accurate as the Y2(+/+) mice but still more impulsive than Y(+/+). At stimulus durations of 0.25 and 0.5s both groups performed worse but the Y2(-/-) mice made significantly fewer correct responses than the Y2(+/+) controls. The anxiolytic drug diazepam at 2mg/kg IP greatly increased the anticipatory responding of Y2(-/-) mice compared to Y2(+/+). The anxiogenic inverse benzodiazepine agonist, FG 7142, at 10mg/kg IP reduced the anticipatory responding of Y2(-/-) but not Y2(+/+) mice. These data suggest that NPY Y2 receptors make an important contribution to mechanisms controlling attentional functioning and ""impulsivity"". They also show that ""impulsivity"" of NPY Y2(-/-) mice may depend on their level of anxiety. These findings may help in understanding the pathophysiology of stress disorders and depression."
"Cortical local field potentials (LFPs) are modulated in parallel with single neuron discharge, but the information they carry is often unclear. Multi-electrode recordings of both LFPs and single neuron activities were made in motor cortex as monkeys performed a delayed pointing task in which the probability of the moment of signal occurrence, and thus movement execution, was manipulated. A large positive LFP component (P1) appeared immediately preceding movement onset only under conditions of low probability, that is, when a response signal was weakly expected. The amplitude of P1 was much smaller when probability of signal occurrence was high, or when the same movement was self-paced. Although P1 has been described as being linked to the descending motor signal, we found that it was more closely associated with the processing of movement-related information than with the ultimate motor command. Its timing did not bear a fixed relationship with movement onset and its frequency of occurrence in each monkey varied in parallel with each animal's overall performance and the percentage of context-related ""pre-processing"" neurons encountered."
"Four experiments were conducted to clarify the central functions of L-serine and its analogs on an acute stressful condition. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of L-serine (0.21, 0.42 and 0.84 micromol) attenuated stress responses in a dose-dependent fashion, as well as induced sleep, in Experiment 1. The effects of L- and D-serine in Experiment 2, those of L-serine, phosphoserine, acetylserine and L-cysteine in Experiment 3 and those of L-serine, glycine and lysophosphatidylserine in Experiment 4 were compared at an equimolar basis (0.84 micromol). D-Serine, proposed as an endogenous agonist of N-methyl-D-aspatate (NMDA) receptor, did not have sedative and hypnotic effects as observed with L-serine. In contrast, all the analogs and derivatives of L-serine had a sedative effect, although with a different manner in several behavioral markers of stress such as spontaneous activity and distress vocalizations. No significant changes in plasma corticosterone concentration were observed in any experiment. Taken together, the i.c.v. injection of L-serine analogs and its derivatives have sedative and hypnotic effects under an acute stressful condition, which does not involve the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In conclusion, L-serine may be effective in improving anxiety or sleep disorders induced by psychological stressor."
"It has been recently shown that lesions of parahippocampal areas including the entorhinal cortex do not disrupt place learning in the water maze, suggesting that the hippocampo-cortical circuitry is not important for spatial memory [Burwell RD, Saddoris MP, Bucci DJ, Wiig KA. Corticohippocampal contributions to spatial and contextual learning. J Neurosci 2004;24:3826-36]. The aim of the present study was to tax more directly the cooperation between the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in two different spatial tasks, a place navigation task and a spontaneous object exploration task, using a disconnection procedure. Damaging the entorhinal-hippocampal system induced impairments in the two tasks but only in the spatial object exploration task rats with contralateral lesions displayed a greater deficit than rats with ipsilateral lesions. The results suggest that the cooperation between the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex is modulated by the nature of the task and the cognitive processes involved in formation of spatial memory."
"Nictitating membrane movement and multiple-unit activity in the somatosensory cortex were recorded from rabbits during paired (N=6) and unpaired (N=5) presentations of a tone conditioned stimulus (CS) and an airpuff unconditioned stimulus (US). A behavioural conditioned response (CR) to the CS and an accompanying neural response in the somatosensory cortex developed only in the paired group. Inactivation of the cerebellar interpositus nucleus abolished both the acquired CR and the accompanying neural response. However, the CS facilitated both behavioural and neural responses to the US during the inactivation. Thus, the absence of the CR could not be accounted for by the general inability of the CS to alter the behaviour constituting the CR or the activity of the somatosensory cortex. These findings suggest that the efferent copy of the signal related to the eyeblink CR is projected from the cerebellum to the cerebral cortical areas of the US modality."
"Object recognition memory was assessed on a novel-object preference (NOP) task in rats with lesions of the hippocampal formation (HPC). The learning and test phases of NOP trials occurred in either the same context or in different contexts. When the learning and test contexts were the same, rats with HPC lesions performed like control rats, displaying a significant tendency to investigate a novel object more than a familiar sample object. When the test occurred in a context that was familiar but different from the learning context, performance was unaffected in control rats, but rats with HPC lesions no longer discriminated between the objects, and therefore showed no evidence of recognizing the sample object. When the test context was unfamiliar, novel-object preference in control rats was attenuated but still above chance levels, whereas rats with HPC lesions did not show a preference. The data suggest that the HPC is not critical for encoding or retrieving conjunctive representations of the context in which incidental learning occurs, whereas it plays an essential role in recognition of objects that are subsequently encountered in different contexts."
"The opiate withdrawal syndrome powerfully motivates opiate seeking and abuse. Development of effective medications for opiate withdrawal symptoms is thus a primary research goal and heavily relies on improved experimental models. This study was carried out to establish a clinically relevant paradigm to assess somatic opiate withdrawal in mice. Female and male C57BL/6J mice were treated with saline or increasing morphine doses (10-50mg/kg or 20-100mg/kg) during 6 consecutive days and tested for the spontaneous expression of somatic opiate withdrawal signs 8, 32, 56 and 80 h after last drug administration. Contrary to opioid receptor antagonist-precipitated procedures, the spontaneous opiate withdrawal paradigm used here revealed interesting gender- and morphine dose-linked differences. In particular, 56 h after last morphine administration elevated global opiate withdrawal scores were still evident in female but not in male mice treated with 20-100mg/kg. The severity of somatic opiate withdrawal directly correlated with the prior cumulative morphine exposure. Timing of expression of somatic opiate withdrawal signs also varied as a function of both gender and morphine dose. For example, expression of paw tremors and wet dog shakes was earlier in opiate-withdrawn male than in female mice. Overall, these findings highlight the possibility to detect gender- and opiate dose-linked differences in the expression and duration of somatic opiate withdrawal using a clinically relevant research model. The behavioral paradigm described here may represent a more appropriate tool to investigate the neurobiological bases of opiate withdrawal as opposed to opioid receptor antagonist-precipitated opiate withdrawal procedures."
"Systemic treatments with acetylcholine (ACh) or dopamine (DA) receptor antagonists during hours 0-4 but not during hours 5-8 following training on a radial arm maze (RAM) or lesions of the dorsal striata impair learning. This suggested that intra-striatal infusions of ACh or DA receptor antagonists during hours 0-4 following training may impair learning. Rats were randomly assigned to groups (ns=5-11) receiving dorsal striatal infusions of the ACh receptor antagonist scopolamine (0-18 microg/microL at 0 and 2h or at 4 and 6h after training), the DA receptor antagonist cis-flupenthixol (0-25 microg/microL at 0, 4 or 12h after training) or the inactive isomer trans-flupenthixol (6 microg/microL at 0 h after training). Scopolamine and cis-flupenthixol impaired the habit-learning version of the task. Given after hours 0-4 following training, the effects of scopolamine were diminished but those of cis-flupenthixol were not. Trans-flupenthixol produced less impairment than cis-flupenthixol. Results suggest that ACh and DA receptors in the dorsal striatum during hours 0-4 following training play a role in habit learning."
"Involvement of the basolateral nuclear group (BNG) in pathological canine aggression was assessed by stereological determination of the volume of the BNG and quantification of the numerical density and total number of BNG neurons in normally behaving and aggressive dogs. A bilateral BNG enlargement of 40% was observed in the aggressive group. This enlargement appeared to be caused by a significantly increased number of BNG neurons. Other alterations such as an increased vessel density, oedema and scar tissue were not observed in any of the examined BNGs. The potential role of neurotrophins and stress hormones in the increased number of BNG neurons is discussed."
"Well-consolidated fear-related memories, once retrieved, are susceptible to disruption and require reconsolidation in order to be maintained. We examined whether reactivated reward-related memories are also susceptible to interference by evaluating the effect of propranolol (PROP), a beta-adrenergic antagonist known to impair reconsolidation of fear-related memories, on context-induced sucrose seeking. PROP administration upon reactivation reduced sucrose seeking behaviour 3 weeks post-training, indicating that reconsolidation of reward-related memories can be disrupted after a long post-training interval."
"The central visual system of white zebra finches is physiologically and anatomically different from normally coloured (wild type) animals. The main difference to normal birds is an enhanced response to ipsilateral stimulation in all areas of the tectofugal visual pathway. Previous experiments indicated that besides an enhancement of recrossing fibers, it might be a lack of inhibition which causes this effect. We show here that such an explanation can only be true for a part of the entopallium, the telencephalic station of this projection. Only within the so-called perientopallium, the number of GABAergic neurons is strongly reduced, while there is no significant difference between white and wild type birds in the other visual areas. It is speculated that these neurons in normal birds inhibit ipsilateral input conveyed by the second visual projection in birds, the thalamofugal pathway."
"C57BL/6 and DBA/2 were compared in the 5-choice serial reaction time task for differences in performance related to attention and impulsivity. The goal was to examine behavioural processes in mice that may relate to ADHD in humans. Groups of male mice were trained to nose-poke in response to a stimulus light presented randomly in one of five holes; correct responses were reinforced with food. During training the stimulus duration (SD) was reduced progressively from 60 to 0.5s. The C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice did not differ during early stages of training when attentional demands were low (SD of 60, 10 or 5s). As task demands increased, strain differences emerged; C57BL/6 mice were more accurate than DBA/2 mice with stimuli of 2, 1 and 0.5s. DBA/2 mice also made more anticipatory (impulsive) responses during inter-trial intervals than C57BL/6 mice at SD of 5, 2, 1 and 0.5s. The ability to carry out the task was present in both strains of mice but they differed significantly in the levels of performance that were achieved. It is argued that the differences in accuracy and anticipatory responding were closely related and that the primary difference between the strains may be in impulsivity."
"Electrical stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal grey matter (DPAG) and deep layers of the superior colliculus (DLSC) of the rat elicits anxiety-like reactions such as freezing and flight. The temporal course of the effects of the aversive electrical stimulation of the DPAG (5, 15 and 30 min afterward) and DLSC (5, 10 and 15 min afterward) on the defensive response of rats exposed to elevated T-maze were determined. The elevated T-maze generates two defensive behaviors, inhibitory avoidance and one-way escape, which have been related, respectively, to generalized anxiety and panic disorders. Prior electrical stimulation of the DPAG (15 min) and DLSC (5 min) enhanced inhibitory avoidance when compared to no-operated and sham animals, although not affecting escape. Therefore, stimulation of the DPAG and DLSC causes a heightened responsivity to anxiogenic stimulus, but not to panicogenic stimulus, inherent to elevated T-maze. These findings support the participation of the DPAG and DLSC in the elaboration of adaptive responses to stressful situations. Besides, the data supports the view that prior electrical stimulation of DPAG and DLSC is selective in sensitizing rats to anxiety-like behaviors, but not to panic-like behaviors in the elevated T-maze test."
"Schmajuk and Larrauri [Schmajuk NA, Larrauri JA. Neural network model of prepulse inhibition. Behav Neurosci 2005;119:1546-62.] introduced a real-time model of acoustic startle, prepulse inhibition (PPI) and facilitation (PPF) in animals and humans. The model assumes that (1) positive values of changes in noise level activate an excitatory and a facilitatory pathway, and (2) absolute values of changes in noise level activate an inhibitory pathway. The model describes many known properties of the phenomena and the effect of brain lesions on startle, PPI, and PPF. The purpose of the present study is to (a) establish the magnitude of startle and PPI as a function of pulse, prepulse, and background intensity, and (b) test the model predictions regarding an inverted-U function that relates startle to the intensity of the background noise."
"Short early manipulations of rodent postnatal environment may trigger long-term effects on neurobiological and behavioural phenotypes in adulthood. However, little is known about such effects of handling on the vulnerability to develop drug dependence. The present study aimed to analyze the long-term effects of a brief handling (1 min) on morphine and ethanol dependence and on the preproenkephalin (PPE) mRNA and mu opioid receptor levels. Handled rats showed a significant increase in morphine (25mg/l) but not ethanol (10%) consumption and preference after 7 weeks and no difference in morphine (2 and 5mg/kg) conditioned place preference. No difference of preproenkephalin mRNA and mu opioid receptor levels was detected in the mesolimbic system between both groups. These data emphasize that human brief handling, which can lead to morphine dependence development, constitutes in itself an experimental treatment and not a control condition."
"Iron deficiency anemia in early childhood is associated with developmental delays and perhaps, irreversible alterations in neurological functioning. The goals were to determine if dietary induced gestational and lactational iron deficiency alters brain monoamine metabolism and behaviors dependent on that neurotransmitter system. Young pregnant rats were provided iron deficient or control diets from early in gestation through to weaning of pups and brain iron concentration, regional monoamine variables and achievement of specific developmental milestones were determined throughout lactation. Despite anemia during lactation, most brain iron concentrations did not fall significantly until P25, and well after significant changes in monoamine levels, transporter levels, and D2R density changed in terminal fields. The changes in D2R density were far smaller than previously observed models that utilized severe dietary restriction during lactation or after weaning. Iron deficient pups had normal birth weight, but were delayed in the attainment of a number of milestones (bar holding, vibrissae-evoked forelimb placing). This approach of iron deficiency in utero and during lactation sufficient to cause moderate anemia but not stunt growth demonstrates that monaminergic metabolism changes occur prior to profound declines in brain iron concentration and is associated with developmental delays. Similar developmental delays in iron deficient human infants suggest to us that alterations in iron status during this developmental period likely affects developing brain monaminergic systems in these infants."
"A neurotoxic regimen of methamphetamine impairs object recognition (OR) in rats. The present study investigated whether neurotoxicity is a necessary component of methamphetamine's effect on OR. Animals were exposed to a sensitizing regimen of methamphetamine, and were tested for OR one week, and locomotor behavior two weeks, later. Quantitative autoradiography was used to measure [(125)I]RTI-55 binding to forebrain dopaminergic and serotonergic transporters. Methamphetamine treatment produced significant OR impairments (and increased locomotion), without reducing dopamine or serotonin transporter binding. This study supports the conclusion that factors other than monoamine terminal injury contribute to the methamphetamine-induced cognitive impairments."
"Hormonal differences between males and females have surfaced as a crucial component in the search for effective treatments after experimental models of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Recent findings have shown that selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) may have therapeutic benefit. The present study examined the effects of raloxifene, a SERM, on functional recovery after bilateral cortical contusion injury (bCCI) or sham procedure. Male rats received injections of raloxifene (3.0mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle (1.0 ml/kg, i.p.) 15 min, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after bCCI or sham procedure. Rats were tested on both sensorimotor (bilateral tactile removal and locomotor placing tests) and cognitive tests (reference and working memory in the Morris water maze). Raloxifene-treated animals showed a significant reduction in the initial magnitude of the deficit and facilitated the rate of recovery for the bilateral tactile removal test, compared to vehicle-treated animals. The raloxifene-treated animals also showed a significant improvement in the acquisition of working memory compared to vehicle-treated animals. However, raloxifene did not significantly improve the acquisition of reference memory or locomotor placing ability. Raloxifene treatment also did not result in a significant reduction in the size of the lesion cavity. Thus, the task-dependent improvements seen following raloxifene treatment do not appear to be the result of cortical neuroprotection. However, these results suggest that raloxifene improves functional outcome following bCCI and may present an interesting avenue for future research."
"In many vertebrates, social interactions regulate reproductive capacity by altering the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. To better understand the mechanisms underlying social regulation of reproduction, we investigated the relationship between social status and one main component of the HPG axis: expression levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRH-R). Social interactions dictate reproductive capacity in the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni. Reproductively active territory holders suppress the HPG axis of non-territorial males through repeated aggressive encounters. To determine whether the expression of GnRH-R is socially regulated, we quantified mRNA levels of two GnRH-R variants in the pituitaries and brains of territorial (T) and non-territorial (NT) A. burtoni males. We found that T males had significantly higher levels of pituitary GnRH-R1 mRNA than NT males. In contrast, GnRH-R2 mRNA levels in the pituitary did not vary with social status. Pituitaries from both T and NT males expressed significantly higher mRNA levels of GnRH-R1 than GnRH-R2. GnRH mRNA levels in the brain correlated positively with GnRH-R1 mRNA levels in the pituitary but did not correlate with pituitary GnRH-R2. Measurements of GnRH-R1 and GnRH-R2 mRNA levels across the whole brain revealed no social status differences. These results show that, in addition to the known effects of social status on other levels of the HPG axis, GnRH receptor in the pituitary is also a target of social regulation."
"We tested the hypothesis that a recently developed transgenic rat model of Huntington's disease (tgHD rats) showed an age-and genotype-dependent change in psychomotor performance and in the frequency of choreiform movements similar to HD patients. Wild type and tgHD (homozygotic and heterozygotic) rats were behaviorally tested at an age of 15 and 20 months. Our results show that tgHD rats exhibit an age-, and genotype-dependent deterioration of the psychomotor performance and choreiform symptoms, closely mimicking the clinical time course changes of psychomotor symptoms of HD patients. These data provide further experimental evidence that the tgHD rat can be considered as a relevant animal model of HD."
"Chronic daily administration of 6.25mg/kg of levodopa in unilaterally 6-OHDA lesioned rats did not induce any observable behavioral effects for the first 12.5+/-2.5 days. Thereafter, levodopa administration induced abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs), involving the contralateral limb, head, neck and trunk, along with the development of contralateral rotations. AIMs and rotations followed a progressively worsening, highly correlated, parallel course. We suggest that rotational behavior does not represent a pure antiparkinsonian response, but along with levodopa-induced dyskinesia is part of the levodopa-induced motor response complications syndrome."
"A microdialysis technique was used to monitor changes in serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) and dopamine (DA) in the extracellular space of the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) of rats to estimate the contribution of these neurotransmitter systems to the acquisition of conditioned taste aversion (CTA). A significant (280%) enhancement of 5-HT was found immediately after saccharin drinking (CS). I.p. injection of unconditioned stimulus LiCl alone (after water drinking) also increased level of 5-HT (200%). However, when saccharin intake was followed by injection of LiCl (CS-US pairing), no change in 5-HT was observed. 5-HIAA and DA were unaffected by any of the above treatments. Thus in spite of elevation of 5-HT in PBN following saccharin consumption alone (CS) or LiCl administration alone (US) no changes in 5-HT occurred after pairing of both stimuli (CS-US). Our work demonstrates that participation of 5-HT in acquisition of CTA appears to be unlikely, and also DA appears not to be engaged in this acquisition at all. At the level of the PBN 5-HT participates mainly in CS and/or US stimuli processing, where this phenomenon has close relationship to other important physiological mechanisms, involved in behavioral control. Such as anxiety, alimentation intake."
"There has been debate whether lesions strictly limited to retrosplenial (RS) cortex impair spatial navigation, and how robust and reliable any such impairment is. The present study used a detailed behavioral analysis with naive or strategies-pretrained rats given RS lesions and trained in a water maze (WM). Naive RS lesioned rats failed to acquire the required WM strategies throughout training. Strategies-pretrained RS lesioned rats were specifically impaired in spatial place memory without a WM strategies impairment. Additional training overcame the spatial memory impairment. Thus the behavioral consequences of the lesion depend on the specific previous experience of the animal. The use of appropriate training and testing techniques has revealed experience-dependant dissociable impairments in WM strategies learning and in spatial memory, indicating that RS cortex is involved in both forms of learning."
"Sickness behaviors are a set of adaptive responses to infection that include lethargy, anorexia, and, of direct relevance to this work, learning and memory impairments. The proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) has been proposed as the primary peripheral mediator of these sickness behaviors, though few studies have investigated the effects of peripheral IL-1beta on learning and memory. We used three different versions of the Morris water task (Morris water task), a spatial learning and memory task, to separately assess the effects of peripheral IL-1beta on acquisition, consolidation, and retention of spatial location information. Using a dose that induced anorexia, assessed as a significant reduction in body weight, we observed no performance impairments in the IL-1beta-treated rats across the different versions of the task, suggesting that peripheral IL-1beta alone is insufficient to induce spatial learning and memory impairments in the rat. The observed dissociation of anorexia and cognitive dysfunction suggests that, either spatial learning and memory are not principal components of the sickness response, or cognitive dysfunction requires different or additional peripheral mediator(s)."
"Ecstasy ((+/-)3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) is a psychostimulant and a synthetic derivative of amphetamine that, according to its consumers, promotes the enhancement of sexual pleasure. This study sought to investigate the effects of ecstasy in the genital reflexes of paradoxical sleep deprived (PSD) male rats. Distinct groups of PSD rats were administered with saline or different doses of ecstasy. The incidence of genital reflexes was verified for 100 min. The four doses that were used induced genital reflexes in PSD animals and these significantly differed from their respective treated control groups. Under the influence of two intermediary doses (2.5 and 5mg/kg), all animals displayed erection and ejaculation. The frequency of genital reflexes was also significantly greater than in relation to the PSD-saline group. The comparison between cocaine and ecstasy in PSD rats revealed that ecstasy induced more erections and ejaculations than cocaine. Thus, the present results showed a great enhancement of the genital reflexes of PSD rats that might have occurred due to serotoninergic alterations induced by this illicit substance when associated to sleep deprivation."
"Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is a tryptophan metabolite synthesized and released by glia and recently shown to be a non-competitive antagonist of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at physiologically relevant concentrations, and NMDA receptors at higher concentrations. KYNA concentration is elevated in individuals with schizophrenia and those with Alzheimer's disease, two populations exhibiting cholinergic-related cognitive impairments. The present study investigated the effects of elevated KYNA concentration on conditioned stimulus processing in rats. For the first 2 days of the experiment, a subset of rats received intracerebroventricular infusions of either KYNA (0.1 microM) or vehicle and were either returned to the home cage or received non-reinforced presentations of a visual stimulus. All rats subsequently received presentations of the same visual stimulus followed by food reward during a 6-day training phase. In vehicle-treated rats, pre-exposure to the visual stimulus reduced orienting behaviour to the light (standing on the hind legs and orienting towards the visual stimulus) when it was later reinforced (i.e., conditioned orienting). In contrast, pre-exposure to the visual cue or 2 days of KYNA pretreatment reduced conditioned orienting behaviour. Finally, the reduction of orienting in KYNA-treated rats following pre-exposure was not as robust as in vehicle-treated rats. These results suggest that elevated KYNA levels can alter specific aspects of attentional processing of environmental stimuli and are discussed in terms of the potential contribution of KYNA to cognitive function and dysfunction."
"Rat/mouse hemokinin 1 (r/m HK-1) is a mammalian tachykinin peptide whose biological functions are not fully understood. Our recent report showed that i.c.v. administration of r/m HK-1 could produce dose- and time-related antinociceptive effect at nanomole concentration, and naloxone significantly antagonized this effect. Thus, we provide indirect evidence favoring a role of NK1 supraspinal receptors in the inhibitory control of descending pain pathways, a role that seems to partially involve the activation of the endogenous opioid systems. Based on this report, the present study was conducted to further investigate the direct functional interaction between supraspinal tachykinin (r/m HK-1) and opioid systems. The results demonstrate that i.c.v. administration of r/m HK-1 (5 nmol/kg) could significantly potentiate the antinociceptive effects of morphine which was injected at peripheral and supraspinal level. These antinociceptive effects were blocked by prior treatment with the classical opioid receptors antagonist naloxone, indicating that the potentiated analgesic response is mediated by opioid-responsive neurons. Consistent with previous biochemical data, a likely mechanism underlying the peptide-mediated enhancement of opioid analgesia may center on the ability of r/m HK-1 to release endogenous opioid peptides. We suggest that there may be a cascade amplification mechanism in pain modulation when the two agents were co-administrated. The synergistic analgesic relationship of morphine and r/m HK-1 established here supports the hypothesis that supraspinal tachykinin and peripheral and central opioid systems have a direct functional interaction in the modulation of local nociceptive responses."
"Investigations of new analgesic treatments ideally are coupled with the use of compassionate methods for pain testing in animals. Recently, we described a novel operant thermal testing device that can be used to quantify orofacial pain. The objective of the current study was to differentiate thermal allodynia from hyperalgesia using this operant thermal assay. Rats were trained to complete a task whereby they had a conflict between a positive reward and tolerance for thermal nociceptive stimulation. They were subjected to cool to hot temperatures (24-45 degrees C) and evaluated under na&#xef;ve (untreated), capsaicin cream (0.075%), capsaicin/morphine, or morphine test conditions. The following outcome measures were evaluated: reward intake; licking contacts; facial contacts; time to complete 25, 50, and 75% of the events (licks and face contacts); facial contact duration; ratio of reward/stimulus contacts; and ratio of facial contact duration/event. Capsaicin produced an increase in mechanical sensitivity and a significant thermal allodynic effect at 42 degrees C and hyperalgesic effect at 45 degrees C. These effects were blocked with morphine pre-treatment. The temporal profile for completing the task was also significantly altered following capsaicin treatment. These data demonstrate that using the operant orofacial assay in conjunction with capsaicin cream can provide a reproducible, sensitive, minimally invasive, and powerful approach for quantifying and studying enhanced thermal pain within the trigeminal system. This technique provides an alternative to reflex tests of orofacial sensitivity, and it presents a pivotal link for translating basic pain research into clinic trial strategies."
"Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), a peculiar lipophilic antioxidant, is an essential component of the mitochondrial electron-transport chain. It is involved in the manufacturing of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and has been linked with improving cognitive functions. The present study shows the neuroprotective effect of CoQ10 on cognitive impairments and oxidative damage in hippocampus and cerebral cortex of intracerebroventricular-streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) infused rats. Male Wistar rats (1-year old) were infused bilaterally with an ICV injection of STZ (1.5 mg/kg b.wt., in normal saline), while sham group received vehicle only. After 24 h, the rats were supplemented with CoQ10 (10 mg/kg b.wt. i.p.) for 3 weeks. The learning and memory tests were monitored 2 weeks after the lesioning. STZ-infused rats showed the loss of cognitive performance in Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests. Three weeks after the lesioning, the rats were sacrificed for estimating the contents of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), reduced glutathione (GSH), protein carbonyl (PC), ATP and the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), cholineacetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Significant alteration in the markers of oxidative damage (TBARS, GSH, PC, GPx and GR) and a decline in the level of ATP were observed in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of ICV-STZ rat. A significant decrease in ChAT activity and a concomitant increase in AChE activity were observed in the hippocampus. However, supplementation with CoQ10 in STZ-infused rats reversed all the parameters significantly. Thus, the study demonstrates that CoQ10 may have a therapeutic importance in the treatment of Alzheimer's type dementia."
"The present study examined the expression pattern of FOS in the hypothalamic peptide neurons during the sleep-dominant state induced by an adenosine A2A receptor agonist. The control rats, those that received the microdialysis-perfusion of their ventral striatum with artificial cerebrospinal fluid in the dark-active phase, spent 24% of the 90-min period prior to sacrifice in non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep and 2.3% of that in REM sleep. These rats exhibited FOS, a transcription factor, in 21% of their orexin neurons and in 1.0% of their melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons in the perifornical/lateral hypothalamic areas. However, the rats perfused with 50 microM CGS21680, an adenosine A2A receptor agonist, spent 60% of the 90-min period prior to sacrifice in non-REM sleep and 11% of that in REM sleep. These rats exhibited FOS in 1.7% of their orexin neurons and FOS in 0.5% of their MCH neurons. When the sleep-dominant state was disturbed by mild stimulation and the rats were kept in the sleepy state by treatment with a sleep-inducing dose of CGS21680, the rats exhibited FOS in 13.3% of their orexin neurons, which percentage was about half of that for the control rats. These results suggest that the sleep-promoting process induced by this adenosine A2A receptor agonist was associated with a decline in the activity of orexin neurons. MCH neurons are not likely to change their activities during this sleep-promoting process."
"In this study we examined whether astrocytic and basic fibroblast growth factor changes after cerebral ischemia can be influenced by rehabilitation training and if these changes are associated with functional improvement. After receiving either ischemia or sham surgery, male adult Wistar rats were assigned to one of two rehabilitation training group: complex environment housing (EC) or paired housing as controls (CON). Rats were tested in the water maze after 14 days of rehabilitation training. Results showed increased expression of reactive astrocytes (GFAP) in all ischemic animals and in the sham EC rats with a significant overall increased seen in the ischemia EC housed animals. The pattern of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) expression seen was somewhat similar to that of GFAP. Behavioral data showed that even though all animals learned to perform the water maze task over time, the ischemia CON rats took longer to learn the task while all the ischemia EC animals performed as well as the sham groups. Regression analysis showed that increased GFAP was able to explain some of the variances in the behavioral parameters in the water maze of the ischemia EC rats suggesting that the activation of astrocytes in this group probably mediated enhanced functional recovery. Lastly, it is possible that the favorable effect of astrocyte activation after cerebral ischemia was mediated by FGF-2."
"The role of endogenous opioid system in learning (Pavlovian conditioning) and reinforcement was studied in newborn rats by pairing central injection of dynorphin A (1-13), an endogenous ligand with high affinity for kappa opioid receptors, with a surrogate nipple. For conditioning, the nipple served as the conditioned stimulus and dynorphin as the unconditioned stimulus. Dynorphin was found to elicit an immediate unconditioned, dose-dependent increase in the neonatal responsiveness to a surrogate nipple providing water, an effect apparently mediated through the kappa opioid receptors. This immediate effect of dynorphin was evident in the context of suckling behavior but not in the context of adult-like drinking when water was delivered through an intra-oral cannula. One hour after injection, the unconditioned stimulatory effect of dynorphin had dissipated and no longer affected responsiveness to the nipple. However, pairing of centrally injected dynorphin and suckling on a nipple delivering water substantially enhanced responsiveness to a nipple 1h later. This suggested conditioning, and hence reinforcement, by the centrally injected dynorphin. The conditioned sustained nipple attachment was mediated through both kappa and micro opioid receptors. These experiments confirm a central role for the brain opioid systems in reinforcement of neonatal behavior on the nipple."
"Following intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of ovine CRF (oCRF), an endogenous peptide agonist at both CRF1 and CRF2 receptors, defensive behaviors of CD-1 mice were evaluated in the Mouse Defensive Test Battery (MDTB). Behavioral measures taken before, during, and after predator (a hand-held anesthetized rat) confrontation included exploratory activity, risk assessment, avoidance, flight, freezing, defensive threat/attack, and residual emotional responses. Both low (0.1 nmol) and high (0.2 nmol) doses of oCRF robustly suppressed exploratory activities and increased risk assessment during the initial familiarization period. Flight speed and jump escapes when the mouse was chased were significantly elevated by the 0.2 nmol dose. Both doses enhanced freezing and avoidance to a distant predator when the escape route was blocked. The 0.2 nmol dose also potentiated flight responses to a contacting predator in a highly confined space. Both oCRF groups traveled shorter distances and exhibited less escape attempts following the removal of the threat stimulus. These findings indicate that non-selective activation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptors via ventricular infusion of oCRF potentiates defensive behaviors relevant to the demand of specific challenges, generally enhancing the predominant defensive behavior in each specific situation."
"In an attempt to model neurodevelopmental defects that may contribute to the outbreak of schizophrenia after adolescence, the present study examined the effects of prenatal interventions in rats, including injections of kainic acid, on motor, cognitive and social behaviour, which was assessed repeatedly between PDs 56-62 (week 8) and 168-174 (week 24), as well as on hippocampal morphology. As compared to untreated controls (n=5-9), the offspring (n=12 or 16) of treated mothers exhibited shorter latencies to leave a dark box and enter an illuminated field on weeks 12, 16 and 20, a higher number of perseverations in a T-maze alternation task on weeks 16 and 20, longer nose contacts with strange and familiar partners in a social interaction test on weeks 12 and 16 and lower weight gains over the course of testing. They also had shorter pyramidal cells in hippocampal area CA3. Thus, the prenatally treated offspring showed certain alterations in their brains and behaviour that resembled the human condition of schizophrenia (e.g., changes at cell level in the hippocampus, perseverative behaviour, lower weight gains), although others (e.g., increased social contacts) did not."
"Effects of morphine- or apomorphine-induced sensitization on histamine state-dependent memory of passive avoidance task were examined in mice. Pre-training intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of histamine (20 microg/mouse) decreased the learning of a one-trial passive avoidance task. Pre-test administration of histamine (10 and 20 microg/mouse) reversed amnesia induced by pre-training of histamine, with maximum response at 20 microg/mouse. Pre-training histamine-induced amnesia was also reversed in morphine- or apomorphine-sensitized mice that had previously received once daily injections of morphine (20 and 30 mg/kg) or apomorphine (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) for 3 days. The reversion of histamine-induced amnesia in morphine-sensitized mice was decreased by once daily administration of naloxone (0.5 and 1 mg/kg), SCH 23390 (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) or sulpiride (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) prior to injection of morphine (30 mg/kg/day, 3 days). Furthermore, once daily administration of sulpiride (50 and 100 mg/kg) but not SCH 23390 (0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) prior to apomorphine (1 mg/kg, for 3 days) decreased the reversion of pre-training histamine-induced amnesia by apomorphine. The results suggest that apomorphine or morphine sensitization affects the impairment of memory induced by histamine and thus it is postulated that opioid and dopamine receptors may play an important role in this effect."
"The anxiogenic neuropeptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), has a complex effect on intermale aggression. CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) is the primary receptor for CRF and in this study, we examined in detail isolation-induced intermale aggression in CRFR1 deficient mice. All mice contained a mixed 50:50 inbred/outbred background to improve aggressive performance. Mice were isolated for 4 weeks prior to 2 consecutive days of aggression testing using the resident-intruder paradigm. Mice were also tested for anxiety on the elevated plus maze. Relative to littermate wild-type (WT) controls, CRFR1-mutant mice exhibited normal levels of intermale aggression over the 2 test days in terms of percentage showing aggression, number of attacks, time aggressive, and latency to first attack. In terms of sites of attacks on intruders, CRFR1-deficient mice attacked the ventral portion of the mid-section (including belly) significantly less frequently than WT males on test day 1, but these differences did not reach significance on test day 2. No other differences in sites of attacks were observed. Tail rattling also did not differ between groups. Importantly, KO males showed decreased anxiety relative to WT mice (consistent with previous reports) as evidenced by spending significantly more time on the open arms and significantly less time on the closed arms of the elevated plus maze. Plus maze performance did not correlate with any measure of levels of aggression, suggesting a dissociation between altered levels of anxiety and aggressive performance. Taken together, the results suggest that the activation CRFR1 is not necessary for the normal production of isolation-induced intermale aggression."
Humans are mainly right-handed for many actions including gestures. This bias is strongly linked to a left cerebral hemispheric dominance for language functions. Whether similar lateralized systems for communicative behaviors are present in other animals is unclear. Here we report the first evidence of strong population-level right-handedness in 60 captive baboons for a species-specific communicative manual gesture. Our findings support the view that lateralization for language may have evolved from a gestural system of communication controlled by the left hemisphere.
"Hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a consequence of liver damage, is associated with cognitive deficits. In this study, behavioral activity, non-associative learning, associative memory, cognitive coordination and flexibility were investigated in rats with subclinical HE evoked by thioacetamide treatment. Non-associative learning was studied in the open field (OF) set up in 12 HE and 8 saline-injected control rats (C). Memory was examined in spatial place avoidance tasks in 10 HE and 10 C rats. The Room+ Arena- task involved the selection of distal room stimuli from irrelevant arena stimuli (i.e. intramaze cues and/or self-motion information), which engages processes of cognitive coordination. Following the Room+ Arena- training, cognitive flexibility of rats was tested in the Arena+ place avoidance condition, which demands the previously ignored stimuli from arena. In the OF test HE and control rats behaved similar. They displayed high activity in the first block of each session and this pattern was stable. In both groups of rats darkness enhanced locomotor activity in comparison to light only in the first block. The HE and C rats avoided the to-be-avoided place in the Room+ Arena- task, whereas only HE rats were affected in the Arena+ task. In conclusion, these results demonstrate cognitive inflexibility in HE rats. We suggest that (1) the behavioral changes in the TAA model are typical of subclinical HE and (2) test for cognitive flexibility may be modified towards a routine use in patients with subclinical HE."
"Sensitisation in contralateral turning behaviour and induction of abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) after subchronic intermittent L-DOPA were compared for their predictive validity as model of parkinsonian dyskinetic movements. L-DOPA treatment produced sensitisation in turning behaviour in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats, when animals were evaluated in hemispherical bowls but not in cages. In contrast, sensitisation in AIMs was obtained both in hemispherical bowls and cages. Results provide evidence that the choice of the environment used in evaluation of AIMs and turning behaviour is of crucial importance."
"Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is a neuropeptide found throughout the brain, particularly in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and hypothalamus. CART was initially discovered and named based on the upregulation of its mRNA in the striatum after acute cocaine or amphetamine injection in rats. CART is also known to participate in a wider range of physiological functions including feeding, anxiety, bone resorption, and insulin regulation. In this report, we demonstrate that knockout mice lacking a functional CART gene show similar cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization and cocaine self-administration to their wild type siblings. Intravenous cocaine self-administration did not differ between CART wild type and knockout mice during acquisition, during schedules of reinforcement that require higher response ratios, or across a range of doses. In conclusion, these data indicate that CART is not integral to the effects of psychostimulants in mice lacking CART throughout development, although it may play a regulatory role in the intact animal."
"Repeated systemic administration of low doses of kainic acid (KA) induces spontaneous convulsive seizures [Hellier JL, Patrylo PR, Buckmaster PS, Dudek FE. Recurrent spontaneous motor seizures after repeated low-dose systemic treatment with kainate: assessment of a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Epilepsy Res 1998;31:73-84]. In this study, male Sprague-Dawley animals received intranigral transplants of a control cell line M213-2O, or a cell line transfected with human GAD67 cDNA (M213-2O CL4) [Conejero-Goldberg C, Tornatore C, Abi-Saab W, Monaco MC, Dillon-Carter O, Vawter M, et al. Transduction of human GAD67 cDNA into immortalized striatal cell lines using an Epstein-Barr virus-based plasmid vector increases GABA content. Exp Neurol 2000;161:453-61], or no transplant. Eight weeks after transplantation surgery, KA was administered (5 mg/kg/h) until animals reached stage V seizures as described by Racine [Racine RJ. Modification of seizure activity by electrical stimulation. II. Motor seizure. Electroencephalogr Clin Neurophysiol 1972;32:281-94]. The group transplanted with CL4 required a larger dose of KA and a longer latency to reach a stage V seizure. In addition, this group exhibited significantly fewer stage III and IV seizures. These results indicate that intranigral transplants of a GABA-producing cell line can decrease the number of kainic acid-induced seizures."
"We have recently shown a significant role of dopamine D(1) receptors in recognition and temporal order memory retrieval for objects in rodents [Hotte M, Naudon L, Jay TM. Modulation of recognition and temporal order memory retrieval by dopamine D(1) receptor in rats. Neurobiol Learn Mem 2005;84:85-92]. The present study investigates the signal transduction pathways underlying dopamine D(1) receptor modulation of retrieval performance in these memory tasks at different delays. We analyzed the level of phosphorylation of both CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) and DARPP-32 (dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein, 32 kDa) in (1) the prefrontal cortex of rats that had performed the object recognition task, (2) the prefrontal and perirhinal cortices of rats that had performed the temporal order memory task for objects. For comparison, we explored the phosphorylation state of CREB and DARPP-32 in the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and hippocampus of rats having performed badly on the delayed spatial win-shift task after D(1) blockade. The improvement in recognition and temporal order memory performance at a 4h-delay was associated with an increased phosphorylation of both CREB and DARPP-32 in the prefrontal cortex of rats treated with the D(1) agonist SKF 81297. By contrast, the significant impairment of delayed spatial memory retrieval after administration of the selective D(1) antagonist SCH 23390 was associated with decreased phosphorylation of CREB and DARPP-32 in the prefrontal cortex. These results provide insight into molecular mechanisms involved in D(1) receptor-dependent modulation of short- versus long-term memory in prefrontal cortex where DARPP-32 in synergy with CREB may represent a pivotal role."
"A cross-fostering paradigm was used to determine whether the differential locomotor and hypothermic responses to neurotensin (NT) in Fischer (F344) and Lewis (LEW) rats are mediated by the post-natal environment. From post-natal day (PD) 1 to PD 21, male pups from each strain were assigned to a same-strain dam (in-fostered) or were cross-fostered, and at adulthood were implanted with a guide cannula over the lateral ventricle. They were then tested for locomotion and hypothermia following injection of vehicle, 0.18, 1.8 or 18nmol of NT or D-Tyr([11])NT. In-fostered LEW, but not F344, displayed a strong dose-orderly hypothermic response to NT and to D-Tyr([11])NT while in-fostered F344, but not LEW, rats displayed strong locomotor responses to D-Tyr([11])NT. Cross-fostering had no effect on D-Tyr([11])NT-induced locomotor responses in either strain; it had no effect also on NT- and D-Tyr([11])NT-induced hypothermia in F344 rats while it slightly increased the sensitivity to NT in LEW rats. The results show that these NT-mediated actions are not influenced by cross-fostering or the pre-weaning environment."
"Mice are uniquely suited as experimental subjects for various approaches to the study of the molecular and genetic basis of behavior, and there has been a corresponding explosion in the use of mice in behavioral neuroscience. Rats and monkeys, however, remain the preferred species for high-order cognitive models largely due to the unavailability of valid, reliable and translatable endpoint measures of behavior in the mouse. Here we present further development and validation of a touchscreen-based operant method for measuring cognition that is comparable to methods used in other species and human patients. C57BL/6J mice were found to show good performance on visual discrimination and reversal learning using this method. Demonstrating the sensitivity of the paradigm to genetic factors, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice exhibited marked differences in discrimination and reversal learning. Systemic treatment with the selective D1-like agonist, SKF81297, produced an impairment in the early phase of reversal learning, but did not alter visual discrimination, in C57BL/6J mice. The same treatment impaired spatial working memory on the T-maze delayed alternation task, but did not alter control measures of behavior including motivation and locomotor activity. These data demonstrate the sensitivity of visual discrimination and reversal learning measured by this method to genetic factors and pharmacological challenge, and thereby provide an extension and further validation of the method for measuring cognition in mice. When combined with emerging molecular techniques uniquely suited to this species such as genetic engineering and RNA modification this paradigm could provide a powerful new tool for behavioral neuroscience."
"The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex have both been implicated in various aspects of the acquisition, retention and performance of delayed matching to position (DMTP) tasks in the rat, although their precise respective contributions remain unclear. In the present study, rats were trained preoperatively on DMTP before receiving excitotoxic bilateral lesions of either the entire hippocampus or the medial prefrontal cortex. Rats with lesions of the prefrontal cortex exhibited a significant delay-dependent impairment on retention of the DMTP task, whereas hippocampal lesions were without effect. Rats were also exposed to a switch in the contingencies to a 'non-matching' rule, as an analogue of switching between decision rules in the human Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, in which human patients with prefrontal damage are impaired. Both lesion groups acquired the new contingency at control levels, providing no evidence towards a role for either of these areas in this type of rule-switching. The same rats were also assessed in a spatial reference memory task in the water maze, which revealed an impairment in escape latencies and path length that was specific to the hippocampal lesions. The results corroborate previous evidence that the hippocampus is not necessary for at least some aspects of working memory performance in the DMTP task, whereas the delay-dependent deficit in the prefrontal lesion group support this task as a potentially powerful tool for assessing the cognitive changes associated with frontal damage and repair."
"Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors have been shown to mediate a number of behaviors including emotionality and responsivity to stress as demonstrated by efficacy in preclinical and clinical studies. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of the mGlu2/3 receptor agonist LY404039 (LY) on operant ethanol (EtOH) self-administration during alcohol seeking (pavlovian spontaneous recovery, PSR), alcohol relapse (alcohol deprivation effect, ADE), and maintenance responding for alcohol. Adult alcohol-preferring (P) rats were trained in 2-lever operant chambers to self-administer 15% EtOH (v/v) and water on a concurrent fixed-ratio 5-fixed-ratio 1 (FR5-FR1) schedule of reinforcement in daily 1h sessions. After at least 10 weeks of daily 1 h sessions, rats underwent seven extinction sessions, followed by 2 weeks of no manipulation, and then rats were tested for the expression of an EtOH PSR for four sessions. Rats were then given a week in their home cage before being returned to the operant chambers with access to EtOH and water (alcohol relapse). Finally, the effects of LY upon maintenance EtOH and water responding were assessed once stable responding was reestablished. The mGlu2/3 receptor agonist LY404039 reduced responding on the EtOH in the PSR test. LY also reduced the expression of an alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) during relapse, but did not reduce EtOH responding under maintenance conditions. The results of this study demonstrate that activating mGlu2/3 receptors inhibits the expression of alcohol seeking and relapse behavior without altering alcohol self-administration behavior."
"In the present study we investigated spatial navigation in male and female Wistar rats in the Morris water escape task. Rats were subjected to procedures which required the use of a place (PLACE), cue (CUE) and egocentric (EGO) response to learn the task efficiently. In a first experiment rats were successively tested in the PLACE, CUE and EGO condition and in a second experiment the order of tasks was reversed. The first experiment showed that female rats swam longer distances and took more time to find the platform in the PLACE task. Further, the female rats spent less time near the previous platform position than the male rats during probe trial. No sex difference was found in the CUE and EGO task. In the second experiment, the female rats took longer to find the platform than the male rats in the EGO task. In the CUE and PLACE task no differences between the sexes was found during acquisition. However, the male rats spent more time near the previous platform position than the female rats during the probe trial of the PLACE task. On basis of present data it is concluded that the use of a PLACE-based strategy is better in male Wistar rats. CUE learning is not sex-dependent. The ability to use EGO strategies appears not to be different between male and female Wistar rats, but appears dependent on pre-exposure to the task."
"Variation in effort to obtain rewards is a fact of mammalian everyday life. In this study, we assess how rats scale variable costs and benefits. Different groups of rats were trained in a T-maze to discriminate a high (three or five sugar pellets) from a low reward (one sugar pellet) arm. Subsequently barriers were introduced at the high and low reward side such that the overall long-term pay-off of the high reward arm finally became lower than that of the low reward arm. The data show that under different regimes of costs (climbing barriers) and benefits (number of rewards) of the two arms rats appear to shift their behaviour towards the better side according to a constant relative cost-benefit ratio between the arms. Such a ratio allows them to deal with variation in the (physical appearance of) costs and benefits and choose the best long-term option."
"Cognitive deficits of schizophrenia constitute a disabling part of the disease predicting treatment success as well as functional outcome. Phencyclidine (PCP), a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist was used to model schizophrenic cognitive dysfunctions of learning and memory using the Morris water maze paradigm for reference memory. In experiment 1 male Sprauge-Dawley rats were acutely administered PCP (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg s.c.) before the first swim session on each of the four acquisition days. Probe test for reference memory was performed 2 days after the last acquisition day; the first probe without drug treatment to assess reference memory and a second probe with prior drug treatment to control for state dependency effects of PCP. In experiment 2 the effects of pre-treatment (10 min before PCP) with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-NAME (10 mg/kg s.c.), on the PCP (2 mg/kg)-induced spatial memory deficit was evaluated in the Morris water maze paradigm for reference memory. The results showed that PCP in a dose of 2 mg/kg disrupts spatial learning as estimated by prolonged search time to find platform during acquisition as well as the reference memory test as measured by less time spent in target quadrant during probe trial. No state dependency effects of PCP were found. Pre-treatment with L-NAME completely reversed the PCP-induced disruption of acquisition learning. The reference memory disruption was, however, not completely restored as measured by probe trial."
"We have previously reported that repeated administrations of quinpirole, a D2/D3 dopamine receptor agonist, facilitate instrumental behavior in rats given the choice between operant and free access to water (contrafreeloading: CFL). The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of repeated daily administrations of quinpirole (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) on the appetitive versus the consummatory component of water-reinforced behavior, under two experimental conditions. Under one condition, the rats were given access to tap water according to an FR3 schedule of reinforcement. Under the second condition, the rats were given the choice between operant and free access to water. Five major findings were obtained. First, acutely quinpirole suppressed operant behavior and, therefore, water intake for at least 1h. Second, upon repeated administrations tolerance developed to the suppressant effect of quinpirole on instrumental behavior but only to a lesser extent to the antidipsic effect, dissociating the appetitive from the consummatory components of water-reinforced behavior. Third, in CFL conditions quinpirole induced a progressively larger preference for the operant access. Fourth, even when the rats were given the choice between free access to highly palatable saccharine (0.05 or 0.01%) solutions and operant access to tap water, quinpirole shifted the animals towards the operant access. Fifth, repeated quinpirole produced lasting consequences on drinking behavior, since after rehydration and under drug-free conditions quinpirole-pretreated rats ingested larger amounts of water than control rats. In conclusion, the repeated activation of D2/D3 receptors appears to induce the rats to perseverate in performing needless instrumental behavior."
"Atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, have been associated with clinically significant weight gain. Changes to the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis may partially mediate this weight increase. Two experiments were conducted to test the effects of mifepristone on both mitigating and preventing olanzapine-induced weight gain. In the first experiment, adult female Sprague-Dawley rats gained significantly more weight on average when administered olanzapine for 35 days compared to vehicle controls. Subsequently, the olanzapine-treated rats were randomized to three dose levels of mifepristone (20, 60, and 200 mg/kg) in conjunction with olanzapine. Weight measurements were taken for 21 additional days. Rats receiving olanzapine plus mifepristone rapidly lost a significant portion of the weight gained during the olanzapine only phase (p = 0.0001). Rats in the 200 mg/kg dose group had significantly less abdominal fat compared to controls (p &lt; 0.001) at study end. In the second experiment, daily mifepristone (20, 60, 200 mg/kg) initiated concomitantly with olanzapine was compared with olanzapine alone to determine if mifepristone prevented olanzapine-induced weight gain. After 21 days of treatment, mifepristone treated rats gained significantly less weight and had significantly less abdominal fat than rats administered olanzapine alone (p = 0.0002). Results suggest that mifepristone, a potent glucocorticoid antagonist, may both reduce and prevent olanzapine-induced weight gain in rats."
"This study examined regional changes in rat brain mRNA levels encoding 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors following chronic olanzapine treatment. The immediate effect (2h after the last treatment) was a down-regulation of 5-HT(2A) receptor mRNA expression, predominantly in the hypothalamus, limbic system and striatum, while a rebound effect was observed 48 h later. 5-HT(2C) receptor mRNA expressions were decreased in the substantia nigra. Correlations between 5-HT(2A) receptor mRNA expression and total food intake, weight gain and energy efficiency were observed."
"Alcoholism is composed of a series of phenomena, which can be approached in model systems. Our aim was to investigate psychogenetics of alcohol drinking behaviour and dependence in the Naples rat lines. Thus, adult male rats of the Naples low- (NLE), high-excitability (NHE) and random-bred control (NRB) lines had 24-h access to a four-bottle system with tap water and 5, 10 and 20% alcohol solutions. Total voluntary alcohol intake and preference were measured during a 6-week period. In order to analyze behavioural dependence, two abstinence periods were introduced, followed by re-exposure to the bottles. The first was a pure re-test and the second was a quinine test (adding 0.02% quinine alcohol solution). Finally, to verify the role of opioids on alcohol drinking behaviour, rats received naltrexone (5 mg/kg i.p.). Thirty minutes later, they had access for 2 h to a three-bottle system with water, 5 and 20% alcohol solution, respectively. Results indicate that (i) total alcohol intake on day 1 was higher in both NLE/NHE, becoming higher in NLE rats during the 6-week period, (ii) different alcohol preference patterns in the Naples lines were observed over time of testing, (iii) during re-test, NLE rats showed neither reversibility nor alcohol deprivation effect, (iv) during quinine test, only NLE rats reduced alcohol intake to a lower extent and (v) naltrexone reduced by 50% the intake of the preferred solution. Therefore, the NLE rats appear as a new model for studying the neural substrates of the dependence behaviour."
"The hippocampus is thought to be involved in a range of cognitive processes, from the ability to acquire new memories, to the ability to learn about spatial relationships. Humans and monkeys with damage to the hippocampus are typically impaired on delayed matching to sample tasks, of which the operant delayed matching to position task (DMTP) is a rat analogue. The reported effects of hippocampal damage on DMTP vary, ranging from delay-dependent deficits to no deficit whatsoever. The present study investigates a novel memory task; the conditional delayed matching/non-matching to position task (CDM/NMTP) in the Skinner box. CDM/NMTP uses the presence of specific stimulus cues to signify whether a particular trial is matching or non-matching in nature. Thus, it incorporates both the task contingencies within one session, and supplements the requirement for remembering the side of the lever in the sample phase with attending to the stimulus and remembering the conditional discrimination for the rule. Rats were trained preoperatively and the effects of bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the hippocampus were examined on postoperative retention of the task. Rats with lesions of the hippocampus incurred a significant impairment on the task that was manifest at all delays intervals. Despite a bias towards matching during training, trials of either type were performed with equivalent accuracy and neither rule was affected differentially by the lesion. This task may prove useful in determining the cognitive roles of a range of brain areas."
"We assessed the neuroprotective effects of quercetin-feeding at doses of 5 and 10 mg/(kg day) on Kunming mice injected daily with D-gal (50 mg/(kg day)) by behavioral tests. Quercetin-fed mice showed higher activity upon induction by new environmental stimuli, lower anxiety and higher novelty-seeking behavior in the open field tasks, and significantly improved learning and memory ability in step-through and Morris water Maze tests compared with D-gal-treated mice. We further investigated the mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective effects of quercetin on mouse brain. Quercetin significantly increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) level. These results imply that quercetin can reverse oxidant impairment induced by D-gal in mouse brain. Neurotoxicity is also associated with Ca(2+) overload induced by oxidant stress. Quercetin could maintain the Ca(2+) homeostasis in the brain of D-gal-treated mice. Furthermore, we also examined the expression of growth-associated protein GAP43 mRNA in mouse brain by in situ hybridization. We found that quercetin dramatically elevated the GAP43 mRNA expression in the brain of D-gal-treated mice to regenerate normal function of neurons against the cellular injury caused by D-gal."
"The aim of the study was to further explore the anatomical and neurochemical background of differences in response to the conditioned aversive stimuli. The different patterns of behavioral coping strategies (a conditioned freezing response and ultrasonic vocalization) were analyzed in animals differing in their response to the acute painful stimulation, a foot-shock (HS: high sensitivity rats, LS: low sensitivity rats, and MS: medium sensitivity rats, according to their behavior in the flinch-jump pre-test), and correlated with plasma corticosterone levels, expression of c-Fos protein, and distribution of 5-HT innervation, in different brain structures. It was found that HS rats showed significantly more freezing behavior, whereas LS animals vocalized much more intensively. The behavior of LS group (less freezing response and stronger vocalization) was related to activation of prefrontal cortex (PFCX), increased activity of adrenal glands and stronger serotonin immunostaining in the PFCX, in comparison with HS animals. The more passive strategy of coping with the aversive event of HS group was related to increased activity of amygdalar nuclei and some areas of the hippocampus, and stronger 5-HT immunostaining in the baso-lateral nucleus of the amygdala, in comparison with LS rats. The present findings suggest that animals more vulnerable to stress might have innate deficits in the activity of brain systems controlling the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that would normally allow them to cope with stressful situations. It appears also that response to pain may determine other patterns of emotional behavior, probably reflecting different activation thresholds of some brain structures controlling anxiety, e.g. prefrontal and secondary motor cortex."
"The main goal of the present fMRI-study was to identify the neural correlates underlying the successful encoding of words which can subsequently be freely recalled or recognized but not recalled. We were particularly interested in common as well as distinct neural substrates of both retrieval modes. To assess qualitatively differently activated brain areas, categorical subsequent memory analyses were applied. In addition, we used linear parametric modulation to detect brain regions associated with ""memory-strength"". Our findings suggest that the successful verbal encoding of words, which were recognized but not recalled relies on a subset of the regions engaged during successful encoding of freely recalled words. Furthermore, it seems to be dependent on the magnitude of relational binding in a prefrontal-hippocampal circuit whether a word can subsequently be recalled freely or only recognized."
"CD26 exhibits a dipeptidylpeptidase-IV function (DPPIV) which regulates neuropeptide activity by N-terminal processing. Because abnormal plasma DPPIV was associated in mammals with behavioral changes, we examined the behavior of CD26-/- mice resulting from targeted inactivation of the gene. These animals had a decreased immobility in the forced swim and tail suspension tests, indicating a reduced depression-like behavior. We addressed some factors that could affect these results. No major differences between mutants and controls were observed in the black/white box test that investigates anxiety. In the hole-board apparatus that explores both curiosity and anxiety, CD26-/- mice of both genders made significantly more head dips than controls. In a motor activity test, mutants displayed higher horizontal and vertical activities i.e. increased novelty-induced behavioral activation. We conclude that DPPIV inactivation in mice broadly leads to an antidepressant-like and hyperactive phenotype."
"The therapeutic properties of typical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) such as haloperidol in schizophrenia treatment are mainly associated with their ability to block dopamine D2 receptors. This blockade is accompanied by side effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Atypical APDs such as risperidone have superior therapeutic efficacy possibly due to their activity at multiple receptors (in particular 5-HT2A receptors). Although the risk of EPS is significantly lower in atypical than in typical APDs, it is not negligible. To investigate and compare the behavioural profile and EPS-asssociated side effects of haloperidol and risperidone APD treatment we applied a multi-tiered, comprehensive behavioural phenotyping approach. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated chronically (28 days) with supratherapeutic EPS-inducing doses of haloperidol and risperidone using osmotic minipumps. Domains such as motor activity, exploration, memory, and anxiety were analysed together with EPS assessment (""early onset"" vacuous chewing movements and catalepsy). Both APDs produced diminished motor activity and exploration, impaired working memory performances, and increased anxiety levels. These effects were more pronounced in haloperidol-treated animals. Chronic APD treatment also caused a time-course dependent elevation of EPS-like symptoms. Risperidone-treated animals showed a catalepsy-like phenotype, which differed to that of haloperidol-treated rats, indicating that processes other than the anticipated dopaminergic mechanisms are underlying this phenomenon. These EPS-related phenotypes are consistent with reported EPS-inducing D2 receptor occupancies of around 80%. Differences in the behavioural profile of haloperidol and risperidone, which were revealed by a comprehensive phenotyping strategy, are likely due to the unique receptor activation profiles of these APDs."
"Exploration in a dark open field undergoes three progressive changes: (i) an initial phase of spending equal amounts of time in various zones of the arena changes to staying in the corners, and ultimately spending most of the time in one corner; (ii) travel paths are first circular and scattered all over the arena, but gradually become anchored to one corner at which they start and end; (iii) traveled distance gradually decreases to that of the initial level seen in a lit open field. Altogether, rodents shift from a 'looping' exploration mechanism with feeble coupling with the environment, to 'home base' exploration which is firmly anchored to the environment. This shift also involves switching from momentary and sporadic to repeated returns to a specific, presumably familiar place, to which the animal navigates back from various other places. We suggest that this switching illustrates navigation first by directional and then by positional environmental cues, as hypothesized in the 'parallel map theory'. We also suggest that the transition from looping to home base behavior is part of a hierarchal construction of space representation via three modes of spatial information processing: (i) piloting--sequential processing, based on moving from one landmark to the next; (ii) orienting--parallel processing, based on moving from one point to the next, with the same starting and ending point; (iii) navigating--continuous processing, based on continuously updating the position in relation to several locations in the environment (map navigation)."
"D-serine and D-aspartate are important regulators of mammalian physiology. D-aspartate is found in nervous and endocrine tissue, specifically in hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, pituitary, and adrenal medullary cells. Endogenous D-aspartate is selectively degraded by D-aspartate oxidase. We previously reported that adult male mice lacking the gene for D-aspartate oxidase (Ddo(-/-) mice) display elevated concentrations of D-aspartate in several neuronal and neuroendocrine tissues as well as impaired sexual performance and altered autogrooming behaviour. In the present study, we analyzed behaviours relevant to affect, cognition, and motor control in Ddo(-/-) mice. Ddo(-/-) mice display deficits in sensorimotor gating and motor coordination as well as reduced immobility in the forced swim test. Basal corticosterone concentrations are elevated. The Ddo(-/-) mice have D-aspartate immunoreactive cells in the cerebellum and adrenal glands that are not observed in the wild-type mice. However, no differences in anxiety-like behaviour are detected in open field or light-dark preference tests. Also, Ddo(-/-) mice do not differ from wild-type mice in either passive avoidance or spontaneous alternation tasks. Although many of these behavioural deficits may be due to the lack of Ddo during development, our results are consistent with the widespread distribution of D-aspartate and the hypothesis that endogenous D-aspartate serves diverse behavioural functions."
"Previous studies have suggested that quetiapine, a new atypical antipsychotic drug, may have beneficial effects on cognitive impairment and be a neuroprotectant in treating neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of chronic administration of quetiapine on methamphetamine (METH)-induced recognition memory impairment and dopaminergic terminal neurotoxicity in rats. Rats were pretreated with METH (5 mg/kg; s.c.) four times at 2-h intervals while their body temperature was monitored. Fifteen minutes after the last METH injection, rats were administered quetiapine (10 mg/kg/day; i.p.) for 28 days. One day after the last quetiapine injection, rats were trained and tested on an object recognition task on days 29 and 30. Finally, on day 31, rats were sacrificed for immunohistochemistry, 1 day after the object recognition task. METH induced hyperthermia, recognition memory impairment and a decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the caudate putamen (CPu) of striatum. Quetiapine attenuated the METH-induced hyperthermia. Furthermore, chronic post-treatment of quetiapine reversed the METH-induced memory impairment and dopaminergic terminal deficit. These findings suggest that quetiapine may have therapeutic effects in the treatment of cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration induced by METH."
"This study analysed the long-term consequences of an asphyctic event at birth on maternal behaviour and emotionality in rats. Pregnant Wistar rats were delivered by Caesarean section and the pups, still in the uterus horns, were placed into a water bath at 37 degrees C for periods of 0 (Caesarean delivery, CD) or 20 min (asphyxia, CD+20). Control subjects were born by vaginal delivery (VD). Subsequently, pups were given to surrogate mothers, weaned at 21 days, and mated at adulthood. After giving birth, differences in maternal competence and behavioural arousal were assessed observing: (i) maternal behaviour after reunion with the pups following a 3h separation, on postpartum day (PPD) 4; (ii) behaviour in an elevated plus-maze test, on postpartum day 7; and (iii) performance in a fear conditioning test, in which subjects learned to associate a conditional stimulus with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (postpartum days 7-8). Results indicate that subjects in the CD+20 group showed a deficit in maternal care, taking a longer time to retrieve the whole litter and often failing to retrieve all pups. Both CD and CD+20 groups showed higher behavioural activity in the plus-maze. In addition, when tested in the fear conditioning paradigm, the CD+20 group showed a lower latency to perform freezing behaviour in the auditory cue trial. The changes in behavioural arousal described suggest that the dopaminergic system may be a potential neurochemical target for an early hypoxic insult and indicate maternal behaviour as a useful endpoint to study the effects of early birth insult on brain function."
"Cat odour and trimethylthiazoline (TMT) are two predator odours commonly used to study defensive behaviour in rats. However their reported efficacy varies markedly across laboratories. We assessed whether rat strain differences might explain such variation. Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats were tested for unconditioned and conditioned responses to both odours. Cat odour produced robust unconditioned and conditioned defensive behaviour, with notably stronger effects in Wistar rats. TMT produced limited unconditioned avoidance, but failed to elicit conditioned responses in either strain. Results support suggestions that faeces-derived odours such as TMT are less predictive of a predator threat than those derived from fur or skin, and identify the possibility that strain differences affect the defensive response seen to predator odours."
"We have studied functional interactions between nicotine and the cannabinoid receptor agonist CP 55,940 (CP) in the modulation of behavioural and corticosterone responses of male and female adolescent Wistar rats. The animals underwent a subchronic nicotine treatment (0.4 mg/kg i.p., once daily) during the periadolescent period (postnatal days 34-43). Twenty-four hours after the last injection of nicotine an acute dose of CP (1 or 100 microg/kg i.p.) was administered. Thirty minutes after the cannabinoid injection, the animals were tested individually in the holeboard immediately followed by the elevated plus-maze. We also measured corticosterone levels by radioimmunoassay. In males, neither CP (1 microg/kg) nor nicotine induced any modification in anxiety when administered alone. However, the combination of the two drugs resulted in a significant anxiogenic-like effect. In females, the lower dose of CP was anxiogenic and nicotine, which did not induce any effect per se, prevented this response. In the holeboard, subchronic nicotine and the acute cannabinoid treatment interacted in the modulation of horizontal activity and the nature of this interaction also showed a clear sexual dimorphism. Both, the cannabinoid agonist and nicotine increased corticosterone concentrations and the animals receiving the two drugs showed higher levels than the animals receiving the cannabinoid alone. The data provide evidence for the existence of functional interactions between nicotine and cannabinoids in the modulation of behavioural responses and adrenocortical activity in adolescent rats."
"It has been shown that L-type voltage dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) have important role in learning and memory. In vivo and in vitro electrophysiological recordings of hippocampal neurons have demonstrated their involvement in long-term potentiation (LTP), which considers being one possible cellular mechanism underlying learning and memory. The long-term effect of VDCCs of hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) so far on synaptic plasticity has not received much attention. In this study, the effect of chronic (60 days) oral administration of L-type calcium channel blocker verapamil on learning and memory and synaptic plasticity of hippocampal dentate gyrus in rats has been investigated. L-type calcium channel antagonist, verapamil chronically and orally at different doses (10, 20 and 50 mg/kg) was used to investigate learning and memory by passive avoidance learning. LTP in perforant-DG synapses was assessed (by either 200 or 400 Hz tetanization) in order to investigate long-term effect of verapamil on synaptic plasticity. In this case, field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slope and population spike (PS) amplitude were measured. Our behavioral study has shown that chronic oral treatment of verapamil has no effect on learning whereas verapamil (50 mg/kg) decreased memory retrieval. Verapamil (20 and 50 mg/kg) inhibited EPSP-LTP induction at 400 Hz but not at 200 Hz tetanization. Furthermore, only verapamil (50mg/kg) decreased PS-LTP with respect to control group. These data suggest that 400 Hz LTP is required for activation of L-type VDCCs and it seems that verapamil is more effective on L-type calcium channels of DG dendrites than their soma."
"Acquisition of spatial learning is an important function of mammalian hippocampus. In order to identify the brain areas in teleost fish that are homologous to mammalian hippocampus, the present study examined the effects of lesions in the dorsal area of the caudal telencephalon of goldfish (Carassius auratus) on the acquisition of spatial learning. An open-field maze that was similar to the dry version of the Morris water maze was used. The task consisted of habituation and postoperative training to reach the position of the bait. Extramaze cues were visible in the habituation sessions in experiment 1, while they were blocked and not visible in the habituation sessions in experiment 2. Only in experiment 2, there was a significant deficit in the performance in the training sessions in the goldfish with damage to the dorsomedial area of the caudal telencephalon (DM). These data showed that blocking of the extramaze cues in the habituation sessions caused deficits in postoperative acquisition of spatial learning in the training sessions in the goldfish with DM lesions. Latent learning in the habituation sessions, however, eliminated the effects of the DM lesions on spatial learning. The present study suggests that the DM plays a critical role in acquisition of spatial learning."
"In order to test the hypothesis that behavioral coping with stressful situations is asymmetrically modulated by the hemispheres, we used the unilateral hemispherectomy procedure to assess the relative importance of each hemisphere in the determination of the immobility time during the forced swimming test. Under anesthesia, adult Swiss male mice were submitted to unilateral (right or left) hemispherectomy or sham surgery. Fifteen days after surgery, the immobile and turning behaviors of each mouse were measured during a 5-min forced swimming testing session. In general, while turning activity decreased significantly as the test progressed, an increase in immobility was observed. The unilateral hemispherectomy asymmetrically affected the immobility time in the forced swimming test. Particularly, the increase in immobility time of right-hemispherectomized mice was greater than that observed for sham-operated ones. In contrast, there were no differences in turning activity between the groups. The higher immobility time in males that had their right hemisphere removed supports the hypothesis that the two hemispheres contribute differentially to the behavioral response to stress."
"The hippocampus is involved in the detection of novelty and is essential for certain forms of learning about environmental events and relationships. The cellular and molecular mechanisms of one form of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation (LTP), are thought to overlap significantly with the neural mechanisms of learning. In this study changes in hippocampal synaptic efficacy were measured in awake, freely behaving rats during exploration of novel environments. Because hippocampal physiology is modulated by on-going behavior, evoked potentials collected during Type 1 versus Type 2 behavior were evaluated separately. The effect of prior LTP induction at perforant path-dentate synapses on exploration-induced changes was evaluated. The results show that exploration causes an increase in population spike amplitude with no change in excitatory postsynaptic potential during Type 1 behavior that lasts longer than 5 min. Prior induction of hippocampal LTP occludes the change induced by exploration. This change is not likely to be due to a reduction of GABAergic inhibition induced by novelty."
"Autonomic dysreflexia is an autonomic behavioural condition that manifests after spinal cord injury (SCI) and is characterized by acute, episodic hypertension following afferent stimulation below the level of the injury. Common triggers of autonomic dysreflexia include colorectal distension (CRD), and various somatic stimuli. The development of autonomic dysreflexia is dependent, in part, upon the degree of intraspinal inflammation and the resultant spinal neuroplastic changes that occur following SCI. 17beta-estradiol (E) has neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and smooth muscle relaxant properties, and is therefore a candidate drug for the treatment and/or prevention of autonomic dysreflexia. Autonomic dysreflexia was assessed in adult male mice treated with E. We investigated whether E could be acting centrally by altering: (1) the size of the small diameter primary afferent arbor, (2) the degree of microglia/macrophage infiltration at the site of the injury, or (3) the amount of fibrous scarring present at the injury site. To determine whether E could be working through uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2), a protein involved with inflammation and regulated by estrogen in some tissues, autonomic dysreflexia was assessed in E-treated adult male mice lacking UCP-2 (UCP-2 KO). 17beta-estradiol was equipotent at reducing autonomic dysreflexia in both UCP-2 KO and WT mice following CRD but not tail pinch. We have shown that E reduces autonomic dysreflexic responses to visceral but not somatic stimulation in male mice independent of the size of the primary afferent arbour, the degree of chronic inflammation, and the presence of UCP-2."
"Amphetamine has been shown to enhance consolidation in a variety of memory paradigms. However, it is not known if amphetamine can modulate the consolidation of the types of context-reward associations involved in drug addiction, such as those formed in the conditioned place preference (CPP) task. Also, some types of memory exhibit a second period of lability following memory reactivation, and it is not known whether amphetamine administered during this period can modulate CPP. Our study investigated whether amphetamine can enhance morphine CPP when administered during the consolidation period or the post-reactivation period. Subjects were trained in the CPP task and injected with amphetamine or vehicle immediately or 6 h after each training session. The day after the completion of training, they were tested. Amphetamine injected immediately but not 6 h after training enhanced morphine CPP. In separate experiments, subjects were first trained in the CPP task. The day following the completion of training, subjects were given a memory reactivation session and injected with amphetamine or vehicle immediately or 6 h after reactivation. Subjects were tested the next day. Amphetamine injected immediately but not 6 h after memory reactivation enhanced morphine CPP. However, amphetamine injected without memory reactivation had no effect on the expression of morphine CPP. Our results suggest that amphetamine enhances the consolidation of morphine CPP and that morphine CPP exhibits a temporally limited period of post-reactivation lability during which the memory can be modulated."
"The present study evaluated the ability of a subchronic intermittent administration of caffeine to induce a sensitized motor response and correlated the individual susceptibility of rats to acute caffeine to the development of sensitization. Moreover, individual susceptibility to caffeine and development of motor behaviour sensitization were correlated to the behavioural response obtained after a challenge with amphetamine. To this end, rats were subdivided in ""low"" and ""high"" responders according to their individual susceptibility to acute caffeine established on the basis of the motor activity observed after the first caffeine administration. ""Low"" and ""high"" responder rats were then repeatedly and intermittently treated with caffeine (15 mg/kg, i.p.), or vehicle, every other day for fourteen days. Three days after treatment discontinuation, behavioural activation induced by acute amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) was measured in vehicle- and caffeine-pretreated rats. Subchronic caffeine resulted in motor sensitization of a variable degree among rats and no difference were observed between ""low"" and ""high"" responders. Moreover, caffeine pretreatment potentiated the behavioural effects of amphetamine according to the degree of caffeine sensitization but not to individual susceptibility to acute caffeine. These results demonstrate that individual susceptibility to acute caffeine does not influence the modifications in caffeine motor effects produced by its subchronic administration and does not affect the enhancement of acute behavioural effects of amphetamine in caffeine-pretreated rats, rather sensitization to subchronic caffeine administration critically influences the behavioural effects of amphetamine."
"Sodium depletion is a strong natural motivator that creates a pronounced sodium appetite and has been shown to activate neural regions associated with fluid and sodium balance. However, it is not known whether sodium appetite affects the mesolimbic circuitry associated with reward motivation. The present studies examined expression of the immediate early gene Fos in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) as a marker of neuronal activation following the induction and expression of furosemide-induced sodium appetite. During sodium appetite expression, sham-drinking and normal drinking were used to dissociate effects of NaCl taste stimulation from the repletion that follows absorption of sodium. These studies revealed that the combination of NaCl taste stimulation and persistent sodium depletion experienced by sham-drinking animals dramatically activates the NAc, while neither induction nor expression of sodium appetite alone is sufficient to increase Fos expression in this region. Results are discussed in terms of current theories of reward motivation."
"Substance P (SP) and methionine-enkephalin (ENK) have been reported to appear in song control nuclei of oscine species. However, it remains unknown whether or not SP and ENK location in song control nuclei is correlated with song behavior. To address this issue, the present study first measured two variables for song complexity, i.e., song repertoire sizes, and syllable repertoire sizes in 11 oscine species. Then, we examined the distribution of SP and ENK in four control nuclei, two in the motor pathway, i.e., HVC and the robust nucleus of arcopallium (RA), and the other two in the forebrain pathway, i.e., Area X and the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN). Finally, we measured the relative amounts of immunoreactivity for SP and ENK in song control nuclei, and tested whether they were correlated with song complexity. Our results showed that: (1) SP and ENK were broadly distributed in the song control nuclei of studied species. However, SP immunohistochemistry was more robust in comparison with ENK, and SP is generally more abundant in the two song learning nuclei than those in the two song producing ones; (2) SP and ENK staining patterns in song control nuclei did not show any obvious phylogenetic relationship among studied oscine species; (3) there was a significant correlation between the relative amounts of immunoreactivity for SP and the song and syllable repertoire sizes. Our results suggest that SP or ENK might be involved in song behavior, such as birdsong learning or memory."
"In this study, we investigated the impact of intracerebral delivery of chemotherapy on functional recovery from focal cortical tissue displacement, characteristic of brain tumors. Unilateral focal brain compression was induced by epidural implantation of an inverted hemisphere-shaped bead over the sensorimotor cortex. Microinjections of a total of 1mg chemoagent fluorouracil or the same volume of saline were made into the compressed cortex. Behavioral tests of forelimb sensorimotor function were conducted during 4 weeks' observation. Rats subjected to any of the three types of lesions, saline microinjection plus cortical compression, chemoagent microinjection alone, or chemoagent microinjection combined with cortical compression, demonstrated significant behavioral deficits in several sensorimotor tasks, compared with saline-microinjected control animals. In placing tests, behavioral deficits elicited by each single treatment were worsened by combined treatment with chemoagent microinjection and focal cortical compression. Concurrently, local delivery of chemoagent into the compressed cortex induced increased cortical tissue loss, necrosis and apoptosis. These data indicate that local chemotherapy exacerbates compression-induced neurological impairment, and a model of controlled focal cortical compression may provide a valuable means to improve anti-cancer therapeutic designs with reduced deterioration of brain function."
"Caveolin-1 is the defining structural protein in caveolar vesicles, which regulate signal transduction and cholesterol trafficking in cells. In the brain, cav-1 is highly expressed in neurons and glia, but its function in those cell types is unclear. Mice deficient in cav-1 (CavKO) have been developed to test functional roles for cav-1 in various tissues. However, neurological phenotypes associated with loss of cav-1 in mice have not been evaluated. Here, we report the results of motor and behavioral testing of CavKO mice. We find that mice deficient in cav-1 have reduced brain weight and display a number of motor and behavioral abnormalities. CavKO mice develop neurological phenotypes including clasping, abnormal spinning, muscle weakness, reduced activity, and gait abnormalities. These data suggest that cav-1 is involved in maintaining cortico-striato-pallido-thalamo-pontine pathways associated with motor control."
"Previous pharmacological studies have implicated dopamine as a modulator of olfactory bulb processing. Several disorders characterized by altered dopamine homeostasis in olfaction-related brain regions display olfactory deficits. To further characterize the role of dopamine in olfactory processing, we subjected dopamine transporter knockout mice (DAT -/-) and dopamine receptor 2 knockout mice (D2 -/-) to a battery of olfactory tests. In addition to behavioral characterization, several neurochemical markers of olfactory bulb integrity and function were examined. DAT -/- mice displayed an olfactory discrimination deficit, but did not differ detectably from DAT wildtype (DAT +/+) mice in odor habituation, olfactory sensitivity, or odor recognition memory. Neurochemically, DAT -/- mice have decreased D2 receptor staining in the periglomerular layer of the olfactory bulb and increased tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity compared to DAT +/+ controls. D2 -/- mice exhibited the same olfactory deficit as the DAT -/- mice, further supporting the role of dopamine at the D2 synapse in olfactory discrimination processing. The findings presented in this paper reinforce the functional significance of dopamine and more specifically the D2 receptor in olfactory discrimination and may help explain the behavioral phenotype in the DAT and D2 knockout mice."
"This study aims to investigate the octopus' eye and arm coordination and raises the question if visual guidance determines choice of arm use. Octopuses possess eight seemingly identical arms but have recently been reported to show a preference as to which arm they use to initiate contact with objects. These animals also exhibit lateralized eye use, therefore, a connection between eye and arm preference seems possible. Seven Octopus vulgaris were observed during approach, contact initiation and exploration of plastic objects that were positioned on three different levels in the water column. The subjects most commonly used an arm to initiate contact with an object that was in a direct line between the eye used to look at the object, and the object itself. This indicates that choice of arm use is spatially rather opportunistic when depending on visual guidance. Additionally, first contact with an object was usually established by the central third of the arm and in arm contact sequences neighboring arms were the most likely to follow an arm already touching the object. Although results point towards strong eye/arm coordination, we did not find lateralized behavior in this experiment. Results are discussed from a neuro-anatomical, behavioral and ecological perspective."
"The convenience of the motor-driven treadmill makes it an attractive instrument for investigating rat locomotion. However, no data are available to indicate whether hindlimb treadmill kinematic findings may be compared or generalized to overground locomotion. In this investigation, we compared overground and treadmill locomotion for differences in the two-dimensional angular kinematics and temporal and spatial measurements for the hindlimb. Ten female rats were evaluated at the same speed for natural overground and treadmill walking. The walking velocity, swing duration and stride length were statistically indistinguishable between the two testing conditions. Significant differences were found between overground and treadmill locomotion for step cycle duration and stance phase duration parameters. During the stance phase of walking, the angular movement of the hip, knee and ankle joints were significantly different in the two conditions, with greater flexion occurring on the overground. Despite this, the sagittal joint movements of the hindlimb were similar between the two walking conditions, with only three parameters being significantly different in the swing. Hip height and angle-angle cyclograms were also only found to display subtle differences. This study suggests that reliable kinematic measurements can be obtained from the treadmill gait analysis in rats."
"We investigated sleep-wake (S-W) architecture and sleep regulation in the ferret: a phylogenetically primitive mammal increasingly used in neurobiological studies. Twenty-four hour S-W baseline data were collected in eight adult ferrets. Seven ferrets were then sleep deprived for 6h at the beginning of the light period. Like other placental mammals, ferrets exhibited the main vigilance states of wakefulness, rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep. Interestingly, the amount of REM sleep in the ferret was considerably higher (24.01+/-1.61% of total recording time) than typically reported in placental mammals. Ferret sleep was homeostatically regulated as sleep deprivation produced a significant increase in NREM EEG delta power during the recovery period. Therefore, ferret sleep in most respects is comparable to sleep in other placental mammals. However, the large amount of REM sleep in this phylogenetically more ancient species suggests that REM sleep may have been present in greater amounts in early stages of mammalian evolution."
"Assessment of cognition and information processing in mice is an important tool in preclinical research that focuses on the development of cognitive enhancing drugs. Analysis of transgenic (TG) and knockout (KO) mice is usually performed on a F2 B6x 129 background. In the present study, we have compared performance of F2 B6x 129 hybrid mice (F2 mice) with that of the two parental inbred strains (C57Bl/6J and 129sv mice), and a wild-type (WT) strain (with a combined B6x 129 background) in three cognitive/information processing paradigms. It was found that the F2 mice outperformed either of the parental strains and provide a control sample with good baseline performance in the Morris water maze (MWM). Reliable deficits could be obtained in learning and memory in this paradigm following injections with scopolamine (0.16 mg/kg) in the F2 mice, which can potentially be used to test effects of reference and novel compounds in order to develop cognitive enhancing drugs. Furthermore, it was shown that the four genotypes showed normal latent inhibition (LI) using the conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm and exhibited no differences in prepulse inhibition (PPI) levels. Following the setup of these procedures in mice, we are now able to compare the effects of gene knockout/mutations used for target validation with results in the present study as a frame of reference."
"Hypoxia-ischemia (HI) is associated with premature birth, and injury during term birth. Many infants experiencing HI later show disruptions of language, with research suggesting that rapid auditory processing (RAP) deficits (i.e., impairment in the ability to discriminate rapidly changing acoustic signals), play a causal role in language problems. We recently bridged these lines of research by showing RAP deficits in rats with unilateral-HI injury induced on postnatal days 1, 7, or 10 (P1, P7, or P10. While robust RAP deficits were found in HI animals, it was suggested that our within-age sample size did not provide sufficient power to detect age-at-injury differences within the pooled HI group. The current study sought to examine differences in neuropathology and behavior following unilateral-HI injury on P1 versus P7 in rats. Ages chosen for HI induction reflect differential stages of neurodevelopmental maturity, and subsequent regional differences in vulnerability to reduced blood flow/oxygen (modeling age-related differences in premature/term HI injury). Results showed that during the juvenile period, both P1 and P7 HI groups exhibited significant RAP deficits, but deficits in the P1 HI group resolved with repeated testing (compared to shams), while P7 HI animals showed lasting deficits in RAP and spatial learning/memory through adulthood. The current findings are in accord with evidence that HI injury during different stages of developmental maturity (age-at-injury) leads to differential neuropathologies, and provide the novel observation that in rats, P1 versus P7 induced pathologies are associated with different patterns of auditory processing and learning/memory deficits across the lifespan."
"Four visual search experiments were conducted using human and chimpanzee subjects to investigate attentional processing of movement, and perceptual organization based on movement of items. In the first experiment, subjects performed visual searches for a moving target among stationary items, and for a stationary target among moving items. Subjects of both species displayed an advantage in detecting the moving item compared to the stationary one, suggesting the priority of movement in the attentional processing. A second experiment assessed the effect of the coherent movement of items in the search for a stationary target. Facilitative effects of motion coherence were observed only in the performance of human subjects. In the third and fourth experiments, the effect of coherent movement of the reference frame on the search for moving and stationary targets was tested. Related target movements significantly influenced the search performance of both species. The results of the second, third, and fourth experiments suggest that perceptual organization based on coherent movements is partially shared by chimpanzees and humans, and is more highly developed in humans."
"We examined the anti-stress action of the essential oils of lavender, rose, and lemon using an elevated plus-maze task (EPM), a forced swimming task (FST), and an open field task (OFT) in mice. Lemon oil had the strongest anti-stress effect in all three behavioral tasks. We further investigated a regulatory mechanism of the lemon oil by pre-treatments with agonists or antagonists to benzodiazepine, 5-HT, DA, and adrenaline receptors by the EPM and the FST. The anti-stress effect of lemon oil was significantly blocked by pre-treatment with frumazenil, benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, or apomorphine, a nonselective DA receptor agonist. In contrast, agonists or antagonists to the 5-HT receptor and the alpha-2 adrenaline receptor did not affect the anti-stress effect of lemon oil. Buspirone, DOI, and mianserine blocked the antidepressant-like effect of lemon oil in the FST, but WAY100,635 did not. These findings suggest that the antidepressant-like effect of lemon oil is closely related with the 5-HTnergic pathway, especially via 5-HT(1A) receptor. Moreover, the lemon oil significantly accelerated the metabolic turnover of DA in the hippocampus and of 5-HT in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. These results suggest that lemon oil possesses anxiolytic, antidepressant-like effects via the suppression of DA activity related to enhanced 5-HTnergic neurons."
"Central dopamine neurotransmission is implicated in several physiological and pathophysiological neural processes. In the past years, attention was paid to the role of dopaminergic signaling in the cognitive processes. In the present study, we investigate role of dopamine D1 receptors in spatial cognition using systemic administration of D1-specific agonist A77636 and D1 antagonist SCH23390. Subsequently, animals were tested in a spatial cognition behavioral task, active allothetic place avoidance (AAPA), a task which requires rats to separate spatial stimuli from two continuously dissociated subsets. The D1 agonist A77636 at doses 0.1 and 0.5mg/kg improved the task solution, whilst application of D1 antagonist SCH23390 (0.02 and 0.05 mg/kg) caused an impairment in the AAPA task. These findings support the notion that brain dopaminergic D1 neurotransmitter system modulates neural processes underlying spatial cognition."
"Octopus vulgaris maintained under a 12/12h light/dark cycle exhibit a pronounced nocturnal activity pattern. Animals deprived of rest during the light period show a marked 'rebound' in activity in the following 24h. 'Active' octopuses attack faster than 'quiet' animals and brain activity recorded electrically intensifies during 'quiet' behaviour. Thus, in Octopus as in vertebrates, brain areas involved in memory or 'higher' processes exhibit 'off-line' activity during rest periods."
"Substance P antagonists of the neurokinin-1 receptor type (NK1) have growing interest as new antidepressant therapies. It has been postulated that these drugs exert this putative therapeutic effect without direct interactions with serotonin (5-HT) neurons. In line with this assumption, previous intracerebral in vivo microdialysis experiments provided evidence that the NK1 receptor antagonists did not change basal cortical 5-HT levels. However, we found that increases in cortical 5-HT overflow caused by systemic injection of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), paroxetine was higher in freely moving (C57BL/6x129sv) NK1-/- mutants than in wild-type NK1+/+ mice. More recently, a pharmacological study has led to a similar conclusion since GR205171, a NK1 receptor antagonist, potentiated paroxetine-induced increases in cortical 5-HT dialysate following its acute systemic or intra-raphe administration to wild-type mice . In the present study, we tested whether an acute combination of SSRI and NK1 receptor antagonist could display antidepressant-like activity using the forced swimming test in Swiss mice. We found that a single systemic dose of GR205171 (10 and 30 mg/kg, i.p.) had no effect by itself. However, it selectively potentiated the antidepressant-like activity of subactive doses of two serotonergic antidepressant drugs, citalopram and paroxetine (without psychomotor stimulant activity), but not that of noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, desipramine. In agreement with neurochemical data, the present study confirms that co-administration of a NK1 receptor antagonist with an antidepressant drug such as a SSRI may have a therapeutic potential to improve the treatment of major depressive episodes in human compared to SSRI alone."
"d-Cycloserine, a partial NMDA agonist, significantly accelerated extinction of a cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) when rats were given systemic injections immediately, but not 4h, after each extinction trial. Infusions directly into the basolateral amygdala had a similar effect. The facilitative effect of d-cycloserine on the extinction of appetitive conditioning is consistent with the idea of the formation of new learned associations during extinction."
"Animals demonstrate their ability to represent a geometric configuration of their environment and to use this information for spatial decisions in their response space in many situations. In presented experiment, we examined the ability of rats to interpret a configuration of abstract visual stimuli to make spatial decisions in a real response space. We tested whether they are able to interpret spatial configuration of abstract stimuli or whether they perceive such visual stimuli simply as geometric patterns associated to particular spatial choices. The rats were tested in a Skinner box with four nosing holes in the transparent front wall through which a computer screen was visible. According to the visual stimuli on the screen, the rats should choose the appropriate nosing hole to obtain a reward. We compared two groups of rats: the first group was exposed to the visual stimuli designed as a representation of the response space: the position of rewarded nosing hole was shown in relation to other nosing holes. The second group was exposed to one of four geometric patterns associated to one of the four nosing holes but without any implicit information about the response space. The results suggested that rats using the stimuli with information about configuration were significantly more successful than rats trained to respond to visual stimuli unrelated to the geometry of the environment."
"Prolonged daily separations of rat pups from their mother have been reported to increase anxiety-like behaviour in adult offspring. However, there are an increasing number of studies not showing this. It has been proposed that the effect of long maternal separation (LMS) is partly due to the disruption of maternal care caused by the separations. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether increasing the number of daily separations would produce more robust effects in the adult offspring on anxiety-like behaviour in the defensive withdrawal test, and on spontaneous motor activity. Since previous studies of LMS have revealed sex differences in behaviour, we included both males and females. In our separation paradigm we subjected rat pups to either two daily 3h maternal separations during the first 2 weeks postpartum (LMS), two daily 15 min maternal separations (brief maternal separations, BMS) during the same time period to control for the effects of handling, or to normal husbandry conditions. As adults we found no effects of this LMS paradigm in male rats, although BMS males showed a tendency toward decreased anxiety-like behaviour. In contrast, LMS females showed a decrease in anxiety-like behaviour. We also found significant sex differences that were most prominent in the LMS group, indicating that females are more sensitive to our maternal separation paradigm. The present study suggests that increasing the number of maternal separations does not increase anxiety-like behaviour in neither male nor female Wistar rats."
"Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotomimetic compound from Cannabis sativa that induces anxiolytic-like effects similar to diazepam in animal models of innate aversive behavior. However, the effects of CBD contextual conditioned fear have not been studied. Therefore, the aim of this work was to compare the behavioral and cardiovascular effects of CBD and diazepam, a prototype anxiolytic, in animals submitted to a contextual conditioned fear paradigm. Male Wistar rats were submitted to a 10min conditioning session (six footshocks, 2.5 mA, 3s, delivered at pseudo-random intervals). The behavioral and cardiovascular responses to the context were measured 24h later in a 10 min test session. Diazepam (2.5 mg/kg), FG-7142 (8 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine inverse agonist, or CBD (10 mg/kg) were administered i.p. before the test session. Conditioned rats submitted to the aversive context exhibited more freezing behavior and a larger increase in blood pressure and heart rate as compared to non-conditioned animals. These effects were attenuated by CBD and diazepam in the conditioned animals. These drugs did not have any effect in non-conditioned rats. FG-7142 treatment failed to change the behavioral and cardiovascular responses to the aversive context. In conclusion, the results suggest that CBD has anxiolytic-like properties similar to those of diazepam in a rat model of conditioned fear to context."
"Early experiences affect brain function and behavior at adulthood. Being reared in a communal nest (CN), consisting in a single nest where three mothers keep their pups together and share care-giving behavior from birth to weaning (postnatal day 25), provides a highly stimulating social environment to the developing pup. CN characterizes the natural ecological niche of many rodent species including the mouse. Here we show that, at adulthood, compared to mice reared in standard laboratory conditions (SN), CN reared mice displayed increased anxiety-like behavior, performing more thigmotaxis in the open field and spending less time in the open arms of the plus-maze. Furthermore, we showed that social context (being alone or with a familiar conspecific in the test apparatus) affects the emotional response in both the plus-maze and open field test and that the relevance of social context changes according to the early social experiences. In particular, CN mice display higher levels of anxiety-like behavior, compared to SN mice, only when alone but not in the presence of a familiar conspecific. Overall, in line with previous findings, the present study suggests that CN mice have a more elaborate social and emotional behavior compared to SN mice and thus may be more appropriate to investigate socio-emotional impairments, in particular in the case of mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, or anxiety and mood disorders."
"Functional neuroimaging studies have suggested that dysfunction of prefrontal cortex (PFC) is present in persons with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). Recently, the development of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has enabled noninvasive bedside measurement of regional cerebral blood volume. Although NIRS enables the noninvasive clarification of brain functions in many psychiatric disorders, it has not yet been used to examine subjects with PDD. The aim of our study was to conduct an NIRS cognitive activation study to verify PFC dysfunction in PDD. The subjects were 10 adults with PDD and 10 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects. Hemoglobin concentration changes were measured with a 24-channel NIRS machine during the letter fluency task. While the number of words generated during the letter fluency task did not differ significantly between groups, the analysis of covariance including IQ as a confounding covariate showed that the PDD group was associated with bilateral reduction in oxy-hemoglobin concentration change as compared with the control group. The statistical results did not change when only IQ-matched high-functioning subjects (N=7) were included. Moreover, reduced oxy-hemoglobin concentration change for the right PFC was significantly correlated with verbal communication deficits within the PDD group. The present findings are consistent with proposed prefrontal dysfunction in PDD subjects identified by other neuroimaging modalities. The present results may be also potentially useful for applying NIRS to clinical settings of child psychiatry."
"In the last years, the role played by the medial nucleus of the amygdala (MeA) in the modulation of fear- and anxiety-related behaviors has been increasingly investigated. This nucleus plays an important role in the processing of predator odor-induced defensive reactions, i.e. freezing and risk-assessment behaviors. Immunohistochemical evidence also indicates that the MeA may be involved in the regulation of escape, a defensive behavior related to panic attacks. In this study, we further addressed this question by investigating the effects of the reversible inactivation of the nucleus on escape behavior generated in male Wistar rats by two different aversive stimuli, electrical stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (dPAG) and exposure to one of the open arms of the elevated T-maze. Results showed that intra-MeA administration of either the reversible sodium channel blocker lidocaine (34 nmol/0.2 microl) or the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol (0.22 nmol/0.2 microl) raised the threshold of aversive electrical stimulation, increasing the amount of current that applied to the dPAG evokes escape, an antiaversive effect. Local microinjection of muscimol (0.22 nmol/0.2 microl) inhibited escape behavior in the elevated T-maze, also suggesting an antiaversive effect. In this latter test, muscimol did not affect inhibitory avoidance, a behavior associated with generalized anxiety disorder. Muscimol effect in the elevated T-maze was independent of changes in general exploratory activity as measured in an open-field. Taken together, our data corroborate previous evidences suggesting that the MeA is involved in the modulation of escape. Dysfunction of this regulatory mechanism may be of relevance in the genesis/maintenance of panic disorder."
"Steroid receptors such as the androgen and estrogen receptors require the presence of several proteins, known as coactivators, to enhance the transcription of target genes. The first goal of the present study was to define the role of SRC-1 on the steroid-dependent expression of the aromatase protein and its activity in male Japanese quail. The second goal was to analyze the rapid plasticity of the POM following antisense treatment interruption. We confirm here that the inhibition of SRC-1 expression by daily intracerebroventricular injections of locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides in the third ventricle at the level of the preoptic area-hypothalamus (HPOA) significantly reduces testosterone-dependent male sexual behavior. In the first experiment, aromatase protein expression in HPOA was inhibited in SRC-1-depleted males but the enzymatic activity remained at the level measured in controls. We observed in the second experiment a recovery of the behavioral response to testosterone treatment after interruption of the antisense injection. However, several morphological characteristics of the POM were not different between the control group, the antisense-treated birds and antisense-treated birds in which treatment had been discontinued 3 days earlier. Antisense was also less effective in knocking-down SRC-1 in the present experiments as compared to our previous study. An analysis of this variation in the degree of knock-down of SRC-1 expression suggests dissociation among different aspects of steroid action on brain and behavior presumably resulting from the differential sensitivity of behavioral and neurochemical responses to the activation by testosterone and/or its estrogenic metabolites."
"Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) has been implicated in a number of the behavioral and biochemical effects of cocaine. We recently reported that central injections of CRF produce a potentiated locomotor response in animals that had been given repeated injections of cocaine up to 4 weeks earlier. We now report that with as few as 1 or 3 exposures to cocaine (total of 45 mg/kg, i.p., per day), and a drug-free period of 28 days, i.c.v. injections of CRF (0.5 microg) produce augmented locomotor responses, similar to those induced by cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) itself. In addition, in animals pre-exposed to cocaine for 3 days, pre-treatment with the CRF receptor antagonist, D-Phe CRF(12-41) (1 microg, i.c.v.), blocks the expression of behavioral sensitization to a cocaine challenge after a 28-day drug-free period. These results demonstrate that short-term exposure to cocaine produces a form of long-term sensitization within systems upon which CRF acts and that activation of CRF receptors is importantly involved in the expression of behavioral sensitization to cocaine."
"The influence of early experience and strain differences on auditory discrimination learning, open field behaviour and brain size was investigated in wild-type Mongolian gerbils (strain Ugoe:MU95) raised in the wild (wild F-0) or in the laboratory (wild F-1) and in domesticated Laboratory Gerbils (LAB). Adult males were conditioned for 10 days in a shuttle box go/no-go paradigm to discriminate two frequency-modulated tones. Significant learning was established within 5 days in wild F-0 and within 3 days in wild F-1 and LAB. Spontaneous jumps in the shuttle box (inter-trial crossings) were frequently seen in wild F-0 and F-1, but rarely in LAB. All groups exhibited nearly the same ability to remember after 2 weeks without training. In the open field test applied on 5 consecutive days, no differences in locomotion patterns and inner field preferences were found. Rearing frequency decreased over 5 days in wild gerbils. Running distances (4-6m/min) were similar in wild F-0 and LAB, but higher in wild F-1. The ratio of brain size to body weight did not differ between wild F-0 and F-1, but was 17.1% lower in LAB. Correspondingly high brain weights in wild F-1 and F-0 support our domestication hypothesis and negate any serious effect of early experience or captivity on brain size in Mongolian gerbils. In contrast, wild F-1 raised in the laboratory show a rapid improvement in learning performance, indicating that early experience rather that genetic differences between strains affect shuttle box discrimination learning in gerbils."
"Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is a persistent organochlorine compound found worldwide that causes significant anatomical, physiological and behavioural abnormalities in humans and wildlife. However, little is known about whether environmental exposure to DDT affects the brain. Here, we show that environmental exposure to DDT alters the brains of American Robins (Turdus migratorius) in several ways. Increasing levels of DDT resulted in: (i) smaller brain and relative forebrain volumes; (ii) a reduction in the size of two song nuclei, nucleus robustus arcopallialis (RA) and HVC; and (iii) a drastic reduction in neuronal size and overall volume of nucleus intercollicularis (ICo), a structure that is critical for normal sexual behaviour. These changes likely result from stress, direct neurotoxicity and androgen receptor antagonism by the primary metabolite of DDT, p,p'-DDE and this is corroborated by analyses of brain region volumes and p,p'-DDE levels. Our results therefore demonstrate that environmental exposure to DDT is correlated with significant changes in the brain and specifically those structures related to mating and song. Given the magnitude of these changes in the brain and the fact that environmental DDT exposure was restricted to early development, we conclude that both humans and wildlife that live in DDT contaminated environments may be at risk of neurological damage."
"Stressful experiences can affect hippocampal structure and function and can suppress new cell birth in the adult hippocampus in several species. Here we examine how repeated intermittent social defeat affects cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus (DG) in mice. Adult male CFW mice were subjected to 10 daily social defeat episodes, 3 defeat episodes within one day or a single defeat episode. Intruder mice were injected with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 200mg/kg, i.p.) 1h after the last fight, and incorporation of BrdU into proliferating cells in the DG was quantified. In a third experiment, aggressive resident mice were allowed to fight with an intruder mouse every day for 10 days, and these residents were injected with BrdU 1h after the last aggressive encounter. There was a significant decrease in cell proliferation in mice that received 10 social defeats, confirming and extending earlier results. This decrease is correlated with the intensity of the defeat experiences, as quantified by frequency of attack bites. Cell proliferation was slightly inhibited after a single defeat, although this effect was not significant. Three defeats within a 5-h period had no effect on levels of proliferation. Offensive aggressive stress in the residents did not result in any changes in hippocampal cell proliferation. These data indicate that repeated intermittent social defeat experienced over multiple days suppresses proliferation in the DG, and this may have important implications for our understanding of hippocampal changes related to stress psychopathologies."
"Orexin containing neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) produce orexin-A (hypocretin-1) and orexin-B (hypocretin-2) and send their axons to the hippocampus, which predominantly expresses orexin 1 receptors (OX1Rs) showing a higher affinity to orexin-A. Recent studies have shown that central administration of orexin-A has an effect on learning and memory but literature concerning the role of orexinergic system in cognition remains controversial. Therefore, we examined the effect of pre-training, post-training and pre-probe trial intrahippocampal CA1 administration of a selective OX1R the orexin 1 receptor antagonist SB-334867-A (1.5, 3, 6 microg/0.5 microl) on acquisition, consolidation and retrieval in a single-day testing version of Morris water maze (MWM) task. Our results show that, SB-334867-A impaired acquisition, consolidation and retrieval of MWM task as compared with the control group. This drug had no effect on escape latency of a non-spatial visual discrimination task. Therefore, it seems that endogenous orexins, especially orexin-A, play an important role in spatial learning and memory in the rat."
"Animal models of drug discrimination have been used to examine the subjective effects of addictive substances. The cAMP system is a crucial downstream signaling pathway implicated in the long-lasting neuroadaptations induced by addictive drugs. We examined effects of rolipram, nefiracetam, and dopamine D2-like receptor antagonists, all of which have been reported to modulate cAMP level in vivo, on the discriminative-stimulus effects of methamphetamine (METH) and morphine in rats. All these compounds inhibited the discriminative-stimulus effects of METH, while only rolipram and nefiracetam attenuated the discriminative-stimulus effects of morphine. In addition, neither nifedipine nor neomycin, two voltage-sensitive calcium channel blockers, was found to modulate the effect of nefiracetam on METH-associated discriminative stimuli, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of nefiracetam may not involve the activation of calcium channels. These findings suggest that the cAMP signaling cascade may play a key role in the discriminative-stimulus effects of METH and morphine and may be a potential target for the development of therapeutics to counter drugs of abuse."
"Several studies on cross-modal attention showed that remapping processes between sensory modalities occur in the spatial orienting of attention. One hypothesis that accounts for such links is that spatial attention operates upon representations of common locations in the external space. However, convincing evidence only exists for cross-modal links in spatial orienting, leaving the dynamics of these effects unexplored. Four experiments were designed to cope with this issue by having participants being involved in an endogenous orienting task to visual and auditory target stimuli. Targets on invalid trials were embedded into two different kinds of sequences of stimuli: (1) long sequences, wherein three valid trials in one modality preceded the invalid trial in the other modality; (2) short sequences, wherein only one valid trial in one modality preceded the invalid trial in the other modality. Results revealed modality-specific meridian effects in the short sequences, and a significant decrement of the modality-specific meridian effect in the long sequences. The results of these experiments indicate that cross-modal links in visual and auditory spatial attention are based on representations of common locations in the external space across sensory modalities. Moreover, the results strongly support the hypothesis that representations of space are dynamically built and updated according to task demands."
"Laboratory animals, when subjected to behavioural tests, are often motivationally primed by a period of prior water or food restriction. To date, it is still debatable which restriction protocol (water versus food) is more appropriate for different species. In general, a protocol is considered appropriate if animal discomfort is kept to a minimum whilst motivation for the task is maximised. Here we present a comparison study of the effects of water versus food restriction protocols in mice. The characterisation of the physiological and behavioural effects of food and water restriction in mice is beneficial for both institutional animal care centres and the scientific community. We have investigated body weight fluctuations in three groups of C57BL/6J female mice (water-restricted, food-restricted and control) in two different protocols (20 h versus 22 h of restriction per day) over 2 consecutive weeks. Subsequently, a selected number of mice from each group were subjected to a battery of behavioural tests to investigate exploratory, emotional and dominance behaviours, in addition to learning and memory processes. Body weight fluctuations suggested that mice tolerate a water restriction regimen better than a comparable food restriction regimen. Furthermore, behavioural performances demonstrated that food-restricted mice show a reduction in the exploration of a new environment and particular aspects of their timing memories are distorted. Finally, both water- and food-restricted mice tended to be more offensive than control mice when paired with an opponent in a social dominance test condition."
"The hippocampus communicates with the neocortex via the entorhinal cortex. These areas are thought to be critically involved in the consolidation of memories. The hippocampus is considered to be the site of association of sensory information, which is then laid down for long-term storage in the neocortex. We examined the projection from the subiculum to the entorhinal cortex to determine whether it could function to transfer this hippocampally-processed information to the neocortex. Following stimulation in the subiculum we demonstrate a negative-going deflection followed by a positive-going deflection in the entorhinal cortex. This projection is capable of short-term plastic changes in the form of PPF. FIn addition, we demonstrate that long-term synaptic changes in the form of LTP and LTD could be sustained for at least 30min on this pathway. Finally we show that PPF changes after LTP and LTD, suggesting that a presynaptic mechanism may be involved in both of these pathways."
"The subiculum has a strategic position in controlling hippocampal activity and is now receiving much experimental attention. However, information regarding this structure remains fragmented and there are important gaps in our knowledge between what we know about the subicular architecture and its biological function. In recent years a substantial amount of in vitro experimentation has explored many aspects of the functional organization of the subicular microcircuits. Here we review these recent findings. We aim to identify the rules that govern the operation of subicular microcircuits in vitro and to relate these to the role of the subiculum in the intact brain."
"Since the initial discovery of place cells in the hippocampus proper, similar spatial firing has been observed in additional regions throughout the hippocampal formation. One such region is the subiculum. Here, most cells show a significant, consistent variation in rate relative to location. Thus, subicular and hippocampal cells are similar, in providing a representation of momentary location in space. However, there are also some fundamental differences. First, many subicular cells have a directional signal superimposed on the place-related patterns. In contrast, hippocampal cells in the open field paradigm used here typically do not show a genuine directional component. The second critical difference has to do with how the cells code different environments. As is well known, hippocampal cells show different spatial patterns in environments which offer distinctly different stimulus properties. For example, a hippocampal cell which fires in the northwest portion of a striped cylinder will likely display a different field, or no field, when recorded in a gray square. In contrast, subicular cells are likely to show the same behavior across environments, such as choosing the northwest region of both enclosures. Further, if two environments differ in size, the subicular patterns will expand/shrink to fit. Thus, it appears that subicular cells form a rigid framework of interrelated firing fields which is fit into each new enclosure. In contrast, hippocampal cells create a new ""map"" specific to each environment. This suggests that the hippocampal and subicular regions work together to help provide the overall cognitive mapping abilities of the animal."
"The mammalian subiculum plays a prominent role in inhibition of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. Lesion and stimulation studies indicate that the hippocampus, acting via output neurons of the ventral subiculum, acts to attenuate stress-induced glucocorticoid release. Lesions of the ventral subiculum enhance glucocorticoid secretion following psychogenic, but not systemic stressors, indicating that the influence of this structure on the HPA system is stressor-specific. Anatomical analyses fail to demonstrate direct interactions of the subiculum with principal stress-effector neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus, consistent with a trans-synaptic mechanism of action. Accordingly, tracing data indicate that glutamatergic ventral subiculum neurons innervate GABAergic neurons in several paraventricular nucleus-projecting neurons in the hypothalamus and basal forebrain, suggesting that inhibition is mediated by glutamate-GABA relays. The subiculum also innervates several limbic forebrain structures that in turn have bisynaptic projections to paraventricular neurons, such as the prefrontal cortex, amygdala and lateral septum, suggesting that the subiculum may have a generalized up-stream influence on limbic stress integration. Finally, recent information suggests that the subiculum may also be stress excitatory under some circumstances, and that there may be substantial strain or individual differences in the net contribution of the subiculum, to stress integration. Overall, the present state of knowledge indicates that the role of the subiculum in stress integration is complex, and likely involves interactions of stress-relevant subicular output with limbic-hypothalamic stress-integrative circuits."
"The ventral subiculum (vSUB) is an interface between the hippocampal formation and structures in the brain reward circuitry, such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). The vSUB powerfully activates the dopamine system, particularly in response to novelty. This activity is both necessary and sufficient to elevate nucleus accumbens dopamine levels triggered by a novel stimulus. Direct stimulation of the vSUB increases the population of active dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area and dopamine levels in the accumbens via a multisynaptic route relayed through the nucleus accumbens. Furthermore, activity in the vSUB is correlated with drug-seeking behaviour such that vSUB inhibition attenuates cocaine-primed reinstatement of drug-seeking, while brief vSUB activation triggers reinstatement cocaine-seeking. We report that acute cocaine alters vSUB pyramidal neuron activity by inducing a frequency-dependent output mode transition from bursting to single-spiking. We suggest that under normal conditions bursting and output mode switching (bursting to single-spiking) may be needed for proper routing of information in and out of the vSUB. We propose that psychostimulants disrupt bursting and output mode switching leading to inappropriate dopamine/novelty signaling that is necessary to set motivational states and direct attention and ultimately, behaviour."
"This paper summarises the picture of the subiculum presented by Gray and McNaughton [Gray JA, McNaughton N. The neuropsychology of anxiety: an enquiry into the functions of the septo-hippocampal system. Oxford: Oxford University Press; 2000]. It is a key node in their ""Behavioural Inhibition System"" and, as such, is embedded within a hierarchy of structures controlling anxiety that is in parallel with a separate hierarchy controlling fear. It can nonetheless be viewed as operating in a fairly simple manner. It receives information about available goals from areas that plan motor action. This is filtered by earlier elements of the essentially unidirectional hippocampal circuit that essentially block familiar and unimportant information while passing to the subiculum important information. The function of the subiculum is to compare and integrate this goal information and produce output when conflict between incompatible goals is detected. This output prevents execution of the responses that would address the conflicting goals, increases the valence of affectively negative stimuli and associations and releases external exploration and internal rumination intended to resolve the conflict. These subicular outputs are held to be computationally simple but to have complex consequences both because of the complexity of the target areas and because, in many cases, processing is recursive. It can involve multiple passages of essentially the same information round loops such as the circuit of Papez--each pass refining the solution to the original problem of conflicting goals."
"The subiculum receives the majority of efferent outflow of neural information from the CA1 region of the hippocampus. As such it occupies a strategic position in which to integrate, transfer and resolve activity from the hippocampus relating to memory and performance. We have previously demonstrated that each structure has complementary ensemble firing patterns that together allow information to be represented continuously over the time course of a trial in a delayed-non-match-to-sample (DNMS) task. Here, we extend this analysis to show the precise manner in which specific neurons in both structures are coupled temporally across the delay interval on a single trial. Neurons in both structures encode position-specific information related to the sample lever press, but only subicular neurons continue to fire during the early portion of the subsequent variable delay interval. However, cross-correlation analysis of multiple spike trains showed that as the delay increased in duration other subicular neurons were temporally coupled to the subicular neurons that fired in the initial part of the delay. This latter population of subicular neurons showed strong cross-correlated firing with other initially activated subicular neurons until midway through the delay (&lt;15s), but on longer delay intervals were coupled to a specific type of hippocampal neuron whose firing was critical for correct performance. Subicular neurons, therefore, play a critical role in bringing the hippocampus ""back online"" when trial delays exceed the minimum duration thus allowing both structures to cooperatively bridge relevant information across longer time intervals than would not otherwise be possible."
"Research in animal neuropsychology is providing an exciting new generation of behavioral tests for mice that promise to overcome many of the limitations of current high-throughput testing, and provide direct animal homologues of clinically important measures in human research. Set shifting tasks are some of the best understood and widely used human neuropsychological tasks, with clinical relevance to traumatic brain injury, schizophrenia, autism, obsessive compulsive disorder, trichotillomania, and many other disorders. Here we report the first successful modification of a human set shifting neuropsychological task, the Intra-Dimensional Extra-Dimensional (IDED) task, for use with mice. We presented mice with a series of compound discrimination and reversal tasks where one stimulus dimension consistently cued reward. Task performance improved with a new set of compound stimuli, as did reversal performance--indicating the formation of a cognitive-attentional set. We then overtrained a subset of the mice, and presented control and overtrained mice with a new compound discrimination where a novel stimulus dimension cued reward. As is the case in human control subjects, control mice persisted in responding to the now-incorrect stimulus dimension, performing poorly on this extra-dimensional shift compared with the previous intra-dimensional shift, thereby validating the task as a measure of set shifting. Furthermore, overtrained mice were impaired on this extra-dimensional shift compared with controls, further validating the task. The advantages and disadvantages of the IDED task compared to high-throughput approaches are discussed."
"Recent findings suggest that Alzheimer's dementia may be mediated by soluble beta amyloid (Abeta) more than the deposits of aggregated, insoluble Abeta, and vulnerability to cognitive deficits after scopolamine challenge may help identify AD even in patients that are still pre-symptomatic. The objectives of the present experiments were to determine if vulnerability to cognitive deficits after scopolamine challenge is related to levels of soluble Abeta, and if levels of soluble Abeta are more closely related to cognitive deficits than levels of insoluble Abeta, even in aged, transgenic mice, after they have developed very high levels of insoluble Abeta. Aged F-344 rats and young mice over-expressing the Swedish mutation in the human amyloid precursor protein (APPsw; Tg2576+) had elevated levels of soluble Abeta, and were more vulnerable to scopolamine challenge in the Morris water maze (MWM), relative to young rats and Tg2576- mice; but, among individual animals, higher levels of soluble Abeta were not correlated with vulnerability to scopolamine. On the other hand, in aged Tg2576+ mice, cognitive deficits were related to levels of soluble Abeta, not insoluble Abeta, despite the fact that the levels of insoluble Abeta were thousands of times higher than the levels of soluble Abeta. The results of the present experiments suggest that vulnerability to cognitive deficits after scopolamine challenge is not related to elevated levels of soluble Abeta, but that high levels of soluble Abeta are more closely correlated with cognitive deficits than the amount insoluble Abeta, even after large amounts of aggregated, insoluble Abeta have been deposited."
"Evidence for an interaction between nicotine and morphine has been found in several studies. In the present study mice withdrawn from a 7-week oral nicotine treatment were administered morphine, following which their locomotor activities were recorded and the concentrations of dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), noradrenaline and their metabolites were measured in the caudate putamen (CPu) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). For comparison, the effect of cocaine on locomotor activity was studied in mice withdrawn from nicotine. Morphine (15 mg/kg s.c.) enhanced locomotor activity significantly more in the nicotine-withdrawn mice than in the controls, whereas cocaine (20 mg/kg i.p.) stimulated the locomotor activity similarly in the nicotine-withdrawn and in the control mice. Morphine (10 mg/kg s.c.) elevated dopamine and 5-HT metabolites to the same degree in the NAc of the nicotine-withdrawn and the control mice. However, in the CPu morphine enhanced the metabolism of dopamine and also that of 5-HT in the nicotine-withdrawn mice but not in the controls. In addition, the basal concentrations of dopamine metabolites were reduced in the CPu of the nicotine-withdrawn mice. Thus, the enhancement of morphine-induced locomotor activation in the nicotine-withdrawn mice could be related to nicotine-induced changes in the regulation of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic and serotonergic systems."
"The effects of extracts of Crocus sativus L. (CSE), on memory were investigated in the rat by using the object recognition and the step-through passive avoidance task. In the first study, post-training administration of CSE (30 and 60 g/kg) successfully counteracted extinction of recognition memory in the normal rat, suggesting that CSE modulates storage and/or retrieval of information. In a subsequent study, pre-training treatment with CSE (30 and 60 mg/kg) significantly antagonized the scopolamine (0.75 mg/kg)-induced performance deficits in the step-through passive avoidance test. These results support and extend prior findings about the implication of CSE in learning and memory mechanisms."
"The present study examined the effect of simulated change in day length on the behavior of a diurnal rodent, the fat sand rat (a species of gerbil). Animals were housed under a short photoperiod (5/19 light/dark cycle) for 3 weeks and compared with controls living under a 12/12 light/dark cycle. All sand rats then underwent the forced swim test for depression-like behavior, and the open-field test for overall activity. Sand rats exposed to the short photoperiod displayed a significantly earlier sinking in the swim test, but there was no difference between their open-field activity compared with controls. Taking these responses as indicative of depression-like behavior, we suggest that a short photoperiod may induce affective-like changes, and that the sand rat may thus offer an appropriate animal model to explore the effect of photoperiod on normal, and perhaps also abnormal, seasonal mood changes (e.g., SAD), which in humans is a prevalent disorder, with winter depression episodes and spring/summer remissions."
"The present study aimed at characterizing the acute and intermittent psychomotor responsiveness to cocaine in mice lacking the MCHR1 receptor, which is thought to modulate the mesocorticolimbic sytem functioning [Smith DG, Tzavara ET, Shaw J, Luecke S, Wade M, Davis R, et al. Mesolimbic dopamine super-sensitivity in melanin-concentrating hormone-1 receptor deficient mice. J Neurosci 2005;25:914-22]. On a first free-drug session, MCHR1-deficient mice exhibited significantly higher levels of locomotor activity elicited by the novelty of the test chambers than their wild-type counterparts. On the following day session, a first injection of 6 or 12 mg/kg cocaine induced comparable dose-related psychomotor activations in both genotypes, without significant difference in the relative increase in locomotion. Over the following eight once-daily test sessions, the slight psychomotor increase induced by 6 mg/kg was equivalent in both genotypes and constant over the sessions. At 12 mg/kg, cocaine induced a clear-cut incremental responsiveness to cocaine in both genotypes on the three first sessions; on the following sessions, only the wild-types displayed an incremental responsiveness until the last session, a sensitized effect that was confirmed for the wild-types but not for the knockouts on a subsequent sensitization test (cocaine challenge). Finally, the knockouts did not exhibit any sign of cocaine-conditioning (saline challenge), contrarily to the wild-types. It is speculated that MCHR1 may contribute to the neurobiological mechanisms of conditioned cocaine-induced psychomotor effects, possibly to those underpinning sensitization, and to a lesser extent to those sub-serving acute pharmacological cocaine action."
"We recently reported that systemic injections of the mGluR(2/3) agonist LY379268, which decreases evoked glutamate release, attenuate context- and discrete cue-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking, but not heroin self-administration. Here, we report that systemic injections of LY379268 attenuate context- and discrete cue-induced reinstatement of sucrose seeking, but not sucrose self-administration. These results suggest that similar neuronal mechanisms mediate cue-induced relapse to opiate- and palatable food seeking."
"Cholecystokinin (CCK) is an endogenous anti-opioid peptide in the central nervous system. The present study investigated the effects of endogenous CCK on tolerance to morphine antinociception in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rats. Chronic administration of morphine to NAc induced marked tolerance to antinociception. Intra-NAc administration of the CCK2 receptor antagonist LY225910 inhibited not only the development but also the expression of chronic morphine-induced antinociceptive tolerance. However, intra-NAc injection of LY225910 did not influence the antinociception induced by intra-NAc administration of morphine in the intact rats. The results indicate that endogenous CCK plays an important role in morphine-induced antinociceptive tolerance in the NAc of rats."
"It is now well accepted that besides its roles in motor control, the cerebellum is involved in non-motor functions with emotional aspects. Consistent with this view, several studies highlighted that the cerebellar Lurcher mutant mice (+/Lc), with motor impairments, also exhibited altered emotional reactivity, previously interpreted in term of behavioural disinhibition. In this study, we investigated the effects of a classical anxiolytic on such disinhibition. For that, behaviours of +/Lc and control (+/+) mice injected with NaCl or chlordiazepoxide (CDP 5 and 7.5mg/kg) were evaluated in the elevated plus-maze test. The motor impact of the drug (7.5mg/kg only) was also evaluated in the hole-board and unstable platform tests. Our results showed that, compared to the +/+ mice, CDP injection greatly influenced the anxious-related behaviours in the +/Lc mice by reducing their preference to the open areas in the elevated plus-maze test. Furthermore, we found that injection of CDP at the dose of 7.5mg/kg aggravated motor coordination deficit, altered motor learning capabilities in the mutants and provoked equilibrium disturbances in the non-mutant mice in the unstable platform test. These results indicated that CDP was able to reduce behavioural disinhibition in the cerebellar +/Lc mice and were discussed in term of implication of the cerebellar connections into CDP-sensitive neural circuitries involved in both emotional and motor processes."
"A number of clinical studies in which early adversities were defined retrospectively, demonstrated that early adverse experiences increased the morbidity rate of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in later life. However, no prospective studies have yet been conducted to elucidate whether early adversity affects the risk or severity of PTSD. Thus, we examined whether early adversity would strengthen the severity of PTSD symptoms in later life by using neonatal isolation (NI) and single prolonged stress (SPS) as an animal model of PTSD. We measured anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze (EPM), contextual freezing in the contextual fear (CF) test, and analgesia in the flinch-jump and hot-plate tests in four groups of adult rats (sham, NI, SPS, and NI+SPS). NI significantly enhanced the SPS-induced decrease in the percentage of open arm time and open arm entries in the EPM, enhanced the SPS-induced increase in contextual freezing, and strengthened SPS-induced analgesia, without any changes in locomotor activity in the open field locomotor test. In addition, we examined the effect of environmental enrichment (EE). Repeated exposure to EE ameliorated the NI-induced enhancement of contextual freezing, but not anxiety-like behavior or analgesia, in response to SPS. The results of the present study demonstrated that while early adversity strengthened PTSD-like symptoms, EE alleviated the enhanced contextual freezing by NI and SPS. These findings suggest that early adversity may worsen dysfunction of the amygdala and hippocampus in PTSD, and an early intervention may alleviate the early adversity-mediated enhancement of hippocampal dysfunction in PTSD."
"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been the focus of a great deal of research and clinical speculation. This intense interest relates to both the perplexing pathogenesis and devastating consequences of these disorders. One of the obstacles to understanding the pathogenesis of autism and to developing efficient treatment has been the paucity of animal models that could be used for hypotheses-driven mechanistic studies of abnormal brain and behavior development and for the pre-clinical testing novel pharmacological treatments. In this report, we briefly review our animal model of ASD based on neonatal Borna disease virus (BDV) infection and present new data about abnormal social interaction in adult BDV-infected rats. We found that neonatal BDV infection profoundly affected social behaviors in adult rats. Compared to the control rats, both 90- and 180-day-old infected rats spent less time in active social interaction and more time in following their partners. In the intruder-resident test, the BDV-infected resident rats exhibited less aggression towards the intruders and showed more the following-the-intruder behavior. The following-the-partner behavior may be an example of ""stereotypic"" activity due to BDV-induced abnormal social communication between rats. The previously published results and present findings indicate that neonatal BDV infection significantly altered the normal pattern of social interaction in rats. Co-localization of activated microglia and dying Purkinje cells in BDV-infected rats suggests that the BDV model could be used to study a pathogenic link of Purkinje cell dropout and neuroinflammation to abnormal social behaviors."
"Head direction cells are described in the presubiculum of the macaque, used as a model of what is likely to be present in humans. The firing rate of these cells is a function of the head direction of the monkey, with a response that is typically 10-100 times larger to the optimal as compared to the opposite head direction. The mean half-amplitude width of the tuning of the cells was 76 degrees . The response of head direction cells in the presubiculum was not influenced by the place where the monkey was, by the 'spatial view' observed by the monkey, and also the position of the eyes in the head. The cells maintained their tuning for periods of at least several minutes when the view details were obscured or the room was darkened. This representation of head direction could be useful together with the hippocampal spatial view cells and whole body motion cells in primates in such memory and spatial functions as episodic memory and path integration. Discrete and continuous attractor networks can be combined so that they contain both object and spatial information, and thus provide a model of episodic memory. Self-organizing continuous attractor neural networks that can perform path integration from velocity signals (e.g. head direction from head rotational velocity, and place from whole body motion) are described. The role of the subiculum in the backprojection pathways from the hippocampus to the neocortex in a quantitative model of the recall of memories from the hippocampus is described."
"Effects of hippocampal or cerebellar lesions have been described extensively, but the ability of behavioural tests for laboratory mice to distinguish between such lesions has not been studied in detail. We compared the behavioural consequences of large bilateral hippocampal and hemispheric cerebellar lesions with eight commonly used tests that included elements of neuromotor performance, exploratory behaviour, and learning and memory ability. Dissociation between the effects of the different lesions was most obviously demonstrated by neuromotor impairment in cerebellum-lesioned mice (typically in the rotarod task) and hyperactivity in hippocampus-lesioned mice (typically in cage activity recordings). Several of the behavioural variables derived from the test battery correlated differently with the size of the hippocampal and cerebellar lesions. In contrast, no absolute dissociation between the effects of these lesions was found in the Morris maze, a reportedly hippocampus-dependent learning and memory task. The contextual fear conditioning task, on the other hand, did reveal a selective decrease of context-dependent freezing in hippocampus-lesioned mice, whereas cerebellum-lesioned animals displayed an increase in freezing responses. By and large, the present battery of tests does allow differentiation between the effects of cerebellar and hippocampal lesions in laboratory mice."
"The effects of reciprocal embryo transfers were studied on anxiety-related behavior of inbred C3H/HeN and DBA/2J mice on the elevated plus maze (EPM), and related to amygdaloid neuropeptide Y (NPY)- and parvalbumin (PARV)-immunoreactive neurons. Embryo transfer significantly reduced closed arm entries in in-stain-transferred C3H mice, and maternal factors influenced open arm entries only in interaction with genetic background and sex. In DBA/2J-mice, embryo transfer resulted in a reduced number of NPY-immunoreactive (NPY-ir) neurons, while PARV-immunoreactive (PARV-ir) cells were not affected. In C3H/HeN mice, however, in-strain embryo transfer only resulted in a reduction of the number of PARV-immunoreactive neurons. Maternal factors mainly induced changes in the number of NPY-ir neurons in the basolateral complex of the amygdala either directly or in interaction with genetic factors. In summary, in-strain embryo transfer had a minor effect on the behavior of C3H/HeN mice, and a differential influence on the numbers of amygdaloid NPY-ir and PARV-ir neurons of inbred C3H/HeN and DBA/2J mice. Maternal factors had a stronger impact on the numbers of NPY-ir neurons than PARV-ir neurons. The present results indicate that alterations in behavior and amygdala morphology induced by embryo transfer or maternal factors depend on the genetic background of the mouse strains used."
"Previous findings indicated that intra-cerebral as well as systemic injections of glucocorticoid hormones shortly before retention testing induce impairment of long-term memory retrieval, but the underlying mechanisms (genomic or non-genomic) are not known. To clarify this issue, we investigated the involvement of protein synthesis in the hippocampus in glucocorticoid-induced impairment of memory retrieval. Young rats carrying bilateral cannulae aimed at the hippocampus were trained in a water maze (MWM) task with six trials per day for six consecutive days. Retention of the spatial training was assessed 24h after the last training session with a 60-s probe trial. Corticosterone (1mg/kg) was injected 30 min before retention testing with or without prior bilateral intra-hippocampal injections of anisomycin (80 or 160 microg/mul per site) as an inhibitor of protein synthesis. The control animals received vehicle or saline solutions. The results show that corticosterone-induced impairment of memory retrieval was not blocked by intra-hippocampal infusions of anisomycin. Our data suggest that corticosterone influences memory retrieval via a protein independent mechanism and provide evidence for rapid actions (non-genomic) of glucocorticoids on memory retrieval."
"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1) is one of the four-member family (TIMPs-1-4) of multifunctional proteins that inhibit matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Its expression in the hippocampus is neuronal-activity-dependent and dramatically induced by stimuli leading to long-term potentiation (LTP), suggesting that TIMP-1 is a candidate plasticity protein potentially involved in learning and memory processes. We tested this hypothesis in a hippocampus-dependent task using the new olfactory tubing maze, with mice carrying a null mutation for TIMP-1 (TIMP-1 KO) and mice overexpressing TIMP-1 (TIMP-1 (tg)). The TIMP-1 KO mice were significantly impaired in making correct odor-reward associations when compared with their respective wild type (WT) littermates, while TIMP-1 overexpressing mice performed better than their WT controls. Both genetically modified mice learned the paradigm and the timing of the task, like their respective WTs, and no olfactory dysfunctioning was observed. These data suggest that TIMP-1 is involved in learning and memory processes related to the hippocampus, and support the hypothesis that the MMP/TIMP ratio, and hence MMP activity, modulates neuronal plasticity in normal learning and memory processes, while altered proteolytic activity could impair cognitive functions."
"The relationship between perception and motor performance was studied in a situation that required perceptual processing of a complex motion stimulus in which a target signal had to be segmented, selected, and tracked. Participants were asked to move their arm in synchrony with one surface of a transparent motion display in which two surfaces moved horizontally back-and-forth over each other. The quality of tracking performance was measured as a function of bottom-up and top-down perceptual cues and their interplay. Target signal strength was manipulated by lowering the relative amount of signal dots constituting the target, i.e., the coherence level (100%-50%-30%-10%; the distractor surface was always 100% coherent). A colour cue that distinguished the target from the distractor surface was either available or absent. In the presence of a colour cue, participants experienced little or no difficulties at coherence levels of 50%-100% but when surface formation was complicated by lowering the coherence level, synchronisation consistency decreased. This corresponds with continuous attempts, successful and unsuccessful, to correct inaccurate synchronisation. In the absence of a colour cue, difficulties were frequently observed in all coherence conditions, but they differed depending on the coherence level. Overall, these results suggest that colour can serve as a strong top-down cue for proper target selection and tracking, provided that bottom-up motion signals are sufficiently strong."
"This paper summarizes published as well as yet unpublished data on the organization of the subiculum. Because of the complex three-dimensional structure of the hippocampus, all traditional planes of sectioning will result in sections that at some point or another do not cut through the hippocampus at an angle that is perpendicular to its long axis; particular focus therefore is on data using the so-called extended preparation. On the basis of our yet fragmented insights in the intrinsic network, as well as the known organization of major efferents and afferents, we propose that the subiculum is organized as a matrix of columnar modules along the transverse axis showing partial laminar connectivity. Although many pieces of the large-scale puzzle on the subicular neuronal network as part of an input-output network for the hippocampus are still missing, it appears that subicular organization is different from that known for CA1. This indicates that major functional differences between CA1 and the subiculum are to be expected."
"Lateralization of brain and behaviour at the population level has been documented in all vertebrate classes. Research was mostly carried out on mammalian and avian species, the least investigated class with this regards being the Reptilia, with studies concentrating on lateralized aggressive behaviour in lizards. No research has been carried out on lateralization in the Chelonian order. We investigated the presence of motor asymmetries in the tortoise Testudo hermanni, using the righting response (i.e. the animal is positioned upside-down and the left/right side to which it uprights is observed), a procedure already employed to assess behavioural lateralization in amphibians. The ability of righting has a particularly high adaptive value in tortoises, as in case of overturning, and consequent exposure to sunrays, changes in body temperature and difficulties in respiration could occur leading to serious conditions. Thirty-four tortoises underwent a series of righting tests in a standardized apparatus, 15 tortoises were also retested 10 months later. A bias at the individual as well as at the population level was found for preferentially turning on the right side. Consistency of responses at retest was also observed. The results are discussed with reference to the implications for the evolution of brain lateralization in vertebrates."
"Both humans and non-humans discount the value of rewards that are delayed or uncertain, and individuals that discount delayed rewards at a relatively high rate are considered impulsive. To investigate the neural mechanisms that mediate delay discounting, the present study examined the effects of excitotoxic lesions of the nucleus accumbens (NAC) on discounting of reward value by delay and probability. Rats were trained on delay (n=24) or probability discounting (n=24) tasks. Following training, excitotoxic lesions of the NAC were made by intracranial injections of 0.5 microl 0.15 M quinolinic acid (n=12) or vehicle (n=12) aimed at the NAC (AP +1.6, ML +/-1.5, DV -7.1). NAC lesions did not alter performance in animals tested with a constant delay (4s) or probability (0.4) of reinforcement. However, when tested with between session changes in the delay (0, 1, 2, 4, and 8s) of reinforcement, the lesioned rats had flatter discount curves than the sham group, indicating that they were less sensitive to frequent changes in the delay to reward. In contrast, the NAC lesions did not affect discounting of probabilistic rewards. NAC lesions impaired the ability to adapt to frequent between session changes in the delay to reward but did not increase or decrease discounting when the delay was held constant across sessions. NAC lesions may disrupt the ability of the animals to predict the timing of delayed rewards when the delay to reward is changed frequently."
"Low sociability is one of the most prominent and disabling symptoms of autism. The biology of sociability is not well understood, and there is no available treatment that adequately improves social functioning in most autistic patients. The development of animal models of reduced sociability can aid in the elucidation of the biology of social behaviors, and may ultimately shed light on the biology of autism. This paper will review evidence that mice of the BALB/c inbred strain show relatively low levels of social interaction in various settings and across various stages of development, including male-male interactions, female-female interactions, male-female sexual interactions, and parenting behaviors. Taken together, this evidence suggests a generally low level of sociability in BALB/c mice that may be relevant to autism. BALB/c mice also show other phenotypes with possible relevance to autism, including relatively high levels of anxiety and aggressive behaviors, large brain size, underdevelopment of the corpus callosum, and low levels of brain serotonin. Further research is needed to determine the relationship among these BALB/c phenotypes, and to determine their possible relevance to autism. In conclusion, the BALB/c inbred strain may be a useful animal model for identifying genes and neurobiological pathways involved in autism-related phenotypes."
"There is strong evidence that the rat retrosplenial cortex (RC) is implicated in spatial navigation and in learning of both aversive and reward-based discrimination tasks. However, its involvement in other functions subserved by the limbic system to which it belongs has not yet been documented. We compared the performance of rats with bilateral excitotoxic damage to RC with that of control rats in a battery of conventional tests, including an open field, plus maze, fear conditioning, step-through passive avoidance, and two-way active avoidance techniques. In the open field, RC-lesioned rats showed somewhat decreased locomotion in the inner zone and increased defecation, which is suggestive of an anxiogenic effect. However, no differences between groups were detected in the plus-maze and inhibitory avoidance tests. Freezing scores recorded during fear conditioning, as well as during the context and tone tests, which were performed, respectively, 24 and 48 h after conditioning, did not differ between the groups. In contrast, acquisition of the active avoidance response was significantly impaired in rats with damaged RC, regarding both response latency and correctness. These data suggest that although the rat RC may play a role in the regulation of emotional responsiveness to new situations, it does not appear to contribute to emotional memory. They are also consistent with the idea that RC is a part of the limbic system that is involved in the compilation of motor programs for complex stereotyped movements such as approach and avoidance."
"Several studies have investigated interactions between opioid and cannabinoid systems. However, the results regarding the rewarding effects of opiates in animals pre-exposed to CB1 agonists, appear inconsistent. Using the conditioned place preference, it was shown that dependence to delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) was hardly reached, while the synthetic ligand WIN55,212-2 facilitate the rewarding effects of morphine. The aim of the present study was to establish whether a chronic THC treatment (10 mg/kg, i.p., 21 days) may facilitate, in mice, the rewarding effects of morphine used at low doses (0.5 and 2 mg/kg, i.p.) or high dose (10 mg/kg, i.p.) after a long drug-free period, as it was speculated that chronic cannabinoid exposure may induce long-lasting neural changes in brain regions involved in opiate addiction. Moreover, THC was used in conditions as close as possible to those leading to cannabis drawbacks. After 15 days of abstinence, the locomotor activating properties of morphine as well as its motivational properties were not facilitated by pretreatment with THC in mice and even reduced for the higher dose of morphine used in the conditioned place preference (CPP). This lack of CPP in animals pretreated with THC was not due to discrimination impairment between different environments, as demonstrated in a two-trial recognition task. In conclusion, it appears that chronic THC treatment leads to a reduction of reinforcing effects of morphine in the CPP. This result supports the occurrence of modulatory interaction between opioid and cannabinoid systems in the reward process."
"Behavioural asymmetries, once thought to be exclusively human, appear to be widespread in vertebrates. A population-level bias should stem from natural selection and reflect a cerebral dominance, while individual preferences might be linked to individual characteristics. Manual laterality has been extensively investigated in non-human primates. However, despite a strong data base, no general patterns have emerged, resulting in a few explanatory theories and little consensus. This study was interested in manual laterality in 12 Campbell's monkeys (Cercopithecus c. campbelli). Several theories were examined, using both direct behavioural observations during feeding behaviour and six controlled experimental conditions, in which we varied task demands to investigate the effect of two factors. We systematically varied the individual posture (sat, tripedal, bipedal, clung) and the complexity of the task (box with or without a lid to open). Concerning the direction of preference, we found individual and action-specific preferences for experimental actions, which match previous reports. No population bias emerged and each subject appeared to react differently to the factors, hereby contradicting the theories. However, concerning the strength of preference, all individuals tended to be affected in similar ways. Spontaneous actions were less lateralized than experimental ones, and the simplest task and spontaneous category tended to show the weakest laterality. The relative complexity and novelty of these actions may account for these results."
"Human tests designed to mirror rodent tests of object recognition and spatial navigation were administered to adult cognitively healthy humans. Facial recognition was also assessed. There was no sex difference in facial recognition, consistent with earlier studies. In the object recognition test, the test-retest NINL total scores during the same visit were highly correlated, comparable to the test-retest correlations obtained in the established facial recognition test. There were no effects of sex on object recognition. However, in the spatial navigation test, there were effects of sex on spatial learning and memory during the session with the hidden, but not visible, target. These tests might be useful to compare assessments of object recognition and spatial learning and memory in humans and animal models."
"We have previously demonstrated that neonatal handling increases sweet food ingestion. In the present study, we examined whether food intake, using different kinds of food, is altered in neonatally handled animals, with or without inducing satiety using a sucrose solution. Abdominal fat, glycemia and hormones linked to appetite including leptin, ghrelin and insulin were also measured. We tested palatable food consumption in the homecage to verify whether environmental cues could influence ingestion. Nests of Wistar rats were either (1) non-handled or (2) handled (10 min/day). Handling was performed on days 1-10 after birth. When adults, rats were habituated to sweet food (Froot Loops, Kellogg's) and to palatable fiber pellets (Fiber One), Nestl&#xe9;). Sweet food consumption was increased in the neonatally handled group, when tested in the homecage, and also in the satiety experiment. These rats displayed a satiety curve when compared to the control group, which ate less but constantly. Handled rats exposed to a sucrose solution decreased sweet food ingestion, which did not occur in the control group. When exposed to a food with complex carbohydrates, these differences disappeared. There were no differences in body weight, abdominal fat or in glycemia, as well as no differences in plasma levels of insulin or leptin. However, ghrelin was decreased in neonatally handled rats. Neonatally handled rats demonstrated an increased consumption of sweet food, satiety responses to sucrose, as well as decreased levels of plasma ghrelin. It is possible that signaling mechanisms related to satiety, both peripherally and/or centrally may contribute to these behavioral findings."
"In the present study, the effects of acute and sub-chronic pretreatment of nicotine on impairment of memory formation and the state-dependent learning by morphine have been investigated in mice. Pre-training administration of morphine (5mg/kg) decreased the learning of a one-trial passive avoidance task, which was reversed by pre-test administration of the same dose of morphine. Amnesia induced by pre-training morphine was also significantly reversed in nicotine (0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg)-treated animals on the test day. Morphine induced amnesia was also reversed in animals which had previously received sub-chronic injections of nicotine, once daily for 3 days followed by 14 days of no drug treatment. The restoration of memory by pre-test morphine was also reduced in animals which had previously received once daily injections of atropine (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg, i.p.) for 3 days after 14 of being days drug free. In the animals, restoration of memory by sub-chronic nicotine administration, was also decreased by once daily administration of atropine (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg) 10 min prior to injection of nicotine (0.1 microg/kg/day, for 3 days) but not with SCH 23390; R(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine HCl (0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) or sulpiride (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) during 3-days of treatment with nicotine. The results suggest that nicotine may induce sensitization which affects the impairment of memory formation via cholinergic but not dopaminergic systems."
"Two forebrain areas in the hyperpallium apicale and in the lateral nidopallium of isolated male zebra finches are highly active (2-deoxyglucose technique) on exposure to females for the first time, that is first courtship. These areas also demonstrate enhanced neuronal plasticity when screened with c-fos immunocytochemistry. Both are areas involved in the processing of visual information conveyed by the two major visual pathways in birds, strengthening our hypothesis that courtship in the zebra finch is a visually guided behaviour. First courtship and chased birds show enhanced c-fos induction in the hyperpallial area, which could represent neuronal activity reflecting changes in the immediate environment. The enhanced expression of fos in first courtship birds in lateral nidopallial neurons indicates imminent long-lasting changes at the synaptic level that form the substrate for imprinting, a stable form of learning in birds."
"Aging is associated with behavioral changes, including increased anxiety. In this study we confirmed a hyperanxious status in aged animals, measured in the elevated-plus maze and in the acoustic startle. Subsequently, we searched for age-related changes in the volume and cell numbers in the amygdala or in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, but failed to detect gross structural changes in these two brain areas, both implicated in emotionality."
"Methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (or beta-CCM) is a benzodiazepine receptor ligand with inverse agonist properties. Two strains of mice were selected, one for sensitivity (BS) and one for resistance (BR) to a convulsive dose of beta-CCM. These two strains were then shown to differ in several biochemical, pharmacological and behavioral characteristics; specifically BS mice were less anxious than BR mice. The present work provides evidence of differences in the learning abilities of the two strains. Three different learning tasks were used: spatial delayed discrimination on the 4-hole board, a learned choice between a lit and a dark compartment in a T-maze, and place-learning in an 8-arm radial maze. In all three tasks, BS mice had consistently better performance levels than BR mice."
"To test the hypothesis that GABA(B) receptor efficacy in the behaving rat decreases after partial hippocampal kindling, we measured GABA(B) receptor efficacy by the number of wet dog shakes (WDSs) induced by baclofen (5mM in 0.2muL of saline) infusion into the dorsal hippocampus; these WDSs were blocked by prior infusion of GABA(B) receptor antagonist CGP55845A. Rats were given 15 afterdischarges (ADs) evoked in CA1 over 3 days or control stimulations. The partially kindled rats (after 15 ADs) showed a significant decrease in baclofen-induced WDSs as compared to control rats, on days 1, 4 and 21 after kindling. In contrast, kindled and control rats did not show a significant difference in WDSs induced by hippocampal infusion of GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline. Also, the number of WDSs induced after subcutaneous injection of serotonin-2A/2C agonist+/-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane was not different between kindled and control rats on 4 and 21 days after kindling. We further tested the hypothesis that the decrease in hippocampal AD-induced WDSs during kindling is caused by a decrease in GABA(B) receptor efficacy. However, we found no convincing evidence to support the latter hypothesis since the AD-induced WDSs were not suppressed by hippocampal infusion of CGP55845A, with the exception that CGP55845A infusion into ventral hippocampus suppressed both hippocampal ADs and WDSs. Together with results derived from previous electrophysiological studies in vitro, it is suggested that a decrease of GABA(B) receptor, possibly GABA(B) autoreceptor, efficacy may explain the decrease of baclofen-induced WDSs after hippocampal kindling."
"The chronic mild stress (CMS) model has been established as a realistic model of depressive disorder as it simulates anhedonia. In the present study, the consumption of sucrose solution was decreased in the rats exposed to CMS, which coincided with many published studies. Since depression is a multifaceted disorder, and a number of symptoms may be present, including circadian rhythm disturbances, we attempted to find the chronobiological abnormalities in CMS rats. After 4-week of the stress procedure, the rhythmic pattern of rectal temperature in the CMS group was extinguished. In particular, the temperature in the CMS group in the light phase was significantly higher than that in the control group. The plasma corticosterone levels in the CMS group were remarkably increased in the light phase compared to the control group, but not in the dark phase. It was concluded that the CMS procedure caused the disturbance of circadian rhythms with hyperthermia and hypercortisolism."
"Stress and drug-associated cues can trigger drug desire and relapse in abstinent cocaine users. Although the role of these two factors in relapse is well documented, it remains unclear as to whether an interaction between stress and drug-associated cues can lead to an enhancement in cocaine-seeking behavior. Here, we assessed the effects of the anxiogenic alpha2-noradrenergic receptor antagonist, yohimbine, on reinstatement of cocaine-seeking in rats either in the presence or absence of cocaine-associated cues. Yohimbine pretreatment in the absence of cocaine-associated cues or cues by themselves reliably reinstated responding on the previously cocaine-paired lever (3-4 times higher than extinction levels). However, animals showed greatly potentiated responding if yohimbine preceded cue-induced reinstatement (10-13 times higher than extinction levels, or 3-5 times over cues or yohimbine alone). While cocaine self-administration produced a significant increase in plasma corticosterone, plasma corticosterone levels did not show a clear relationship to cocaine-paired lever responding during cue and/or yohimbine-induced reinstatement. These results demonstrate that exposure to drug-paired cues during a stressful state can greatly potentiate cocaine-seeking and suggest that future treatment interventions should target multiple modalities."
"The ventral pallidum (VP) supports self-stimulation and has anatomical connections that suggest it could be linked to medial forebrain bundle (MFB) self-stimulation. Dorsal VP appears to be more related to dorsal striatopallidum and thus to cognitive control of movement, while ventral VP appears to be more related to linking motivation to action. In this study we challenged MFB self-stimulation by temporarily inactivating dorsal and ventral VP. We assessed changes in performance capacity and stimulation reward value using the rate-frequency curve shift paradigm. VP inactivation, especially in the ventral aspect of the VP ipsilateral to the stimulation site, was more likely to substantially impair maximum response rate than to affect the frequency required to maintain half-maximal responding. These effects were transient, typically disappearing within 20 min following inactivation. Contralateral inactivation was relatively ineffective and bilateral inactivation was surprisingly less effective than ipsilateral inactivation alone, although bilaterally symmetric injection sites were largely confined to the dorsal VP. The fact that inactivation-induced changes in maximum response rate were more prominent than changes in the frequency required to maintain half-maximal responding suggests a role for the ventral VP in linking reward to responding rather than detecting or computing reward value."
"Previous research has shown that spinally transected rats will learn to maintain a flexion response when administered shock contingent upon leg position. In short, a contingency is arranged between shock delivery and leg extension so that Master rats exhibit an increase in flexion duration that lasts throughout the training session. Furthermore, when Master rats are later tested they reacquire the flexion response in fewer trials, indicative of some savings. As a control, a second group of spinal rats (Yoked rats) are given shock irrespective of leg position (noncontingent shock). These animals fail to show the same increase in leg flexion duration. Interestingly, when Yoked rats are later tested with a shock contingency in place, they still fail to learn (learning deficit). The present experiments were designed to determine whether both forms of instrumental learning in spinal animals require de novo protein synthesis. As such, we administered various doses of anisomycin intrathecally prior to training. Additionally, spinal rats were trained and tested either immediately or 24 h after test. We found that only the highest dose of anisomycin (125 microg/microl) had an effect in Yoked animals that were tested 24 h after training. Specifically, the highest dose of anisomycin reversed the learning deficit in those animals. Moreover, anisomycin had a similar effect when administered prior to training and immediately following training, but not 6 h after training. Finally, the results demonstrated that the observed effect of anisomycin was not due to state-dependency."
"Given that protein malnutrition induces structural, neurochemical and functional changes in the CNS, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of short-term early protein malnutrition on the behavior and reactivity to diazepam (DZ) in the elevated plus-maze test (EPM). Male Wistar rats (n=176) from well-nourished (16%-protein) or malnourished litters (6%-protein) were distributed in five different groups: W (well-nourished), M7 (malnourished for 7 days), M14 (malnourished for 14 days), M21 (malnourished for 21 days) and M28 (malnourished for 28 days) since birthday. EPM results showed that the longer the exposition to the deficient diet, the lower the anxiety of malnourished animals, a result similar to that produced by the treatment with DZ. This anxiolytic-like effect suggested that short-term malnutrition may affect neural and/or neurochemical systems believed to underlie behavioral expression in anxiogenic experimental situations."
"We have previously shown that male mice carrying a targeted mutation in the Cyp19 gene which encodes the aromatase enzyme (aromatase knockout or ArKO), showed a reduced interest to investigate volatile odors from conspecifics in a Y-maze. We asked here whether the incentive value of reproductively relevant odors is reduced in ArKO males by comparing the ability of male wild-type (WT) and ArKO mice to learn a conditioned place preference using exposure to reproductively relevant odors as incentive stimuli. When the presence of an anesthetized estrous female or soiled bedding from estrous females was used as incentive stimuli, only WT and not male ArKO mice showed conditioned place preference suggesting that the reward value of these stimuli is reduced in ArKO males. However, ArKO males showed conditioned place preference when cocaine was used as incentive stimulus, indicating that ArKO males are able to learn the conditioned place preference procedure. These results thus further confirm the important role of estradiol in sexually related behavioral responses in male mice."
"Phencyclidine (PCP), a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, was used to model schizophrenia-like cognitive dysfunctions of learning and memory in rats using the Morris water maze model for spatial memory. A protocol introduced by Baldi and co-workers was used to distinguish working memory from reference memory. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered PCP (2.0 mg/kg) before the first swimming trial on each of five spatial memory acquisition days, either alone or after pre-treatment with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-NAME (10 mg/kg). Probe tests for memory were conducted before and after each acquisition session. The results showed that PCP disrupted the acquisition of both working and reference memory. Pre-treatment with L-NAME reversed both these effects of PCP. L-NAME treatment by itself did not significantly alter either acquisition or retention of spatial memory."
"The study of sex differences in the onset, progression and symptoms of Parkinson's disease, in humans, has led to mixed results. In this study, we used a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion animal model of Parkinson's disease, to address whether there are sex differences in the composition of the movements used during vertical exploration within a confined cylinder. Tyrosine hydroxylase staining and apomorphine induced rotation were used to confirm lesion magnitude. There were no sex differences or lesion effects in the frequency of occurrence of a vertical bout or the average time spent vertical. Both male and female 6-OHDA animals exhibited equal impairments in the use of the forelimbs during vertical exploration. 6-OHDA males, as compared to 6-OHDA females, however, had a significant reduction in the use of their hindlimbs. An analysis of hindlimb step direction revealed that while sham females were more likely to step forward, sham males were more likely to step backwards during a vertical bout. This sex difference was no longer present in the 6-OHDA animals. Finally, 6-OHDA males were significantly more likely to place their dorsal surface in contact with the wall of the cylinder to maintain an upright posture during a vertical bout than animals in any other condition. These results demonstrate that the use of a confined cylinder task is appropriate for the kinematic analysis of sex differences in vertical behaviour and show that there are sex differences in motor behaviour in an animal model of human Parkinson's disease."
"Environmental enrichment (E) can change neuronal structure, improves learning in various tasks and increases cerebral plasticity. However, no E effects were found in a test measuring social olfactory discrimination memory and, although they have been mainly measured in males, gender differences have been reported in other tests. The aims of the present study were to evaluate gender differential effects of E in the social discrimination paradigm which also involves social olfactory discrimination and in the elevated plus-maze test (EPM) for measuring anxiety. E procedure consisted of a combination of social and physical factors; groups of 11-12 Sprague-Dawley rats were separated by sex in large cages with physical stimulus for a period of 8 weeks starting immediately after weaning. Differential gender E effects appeared in the social exploratory patterns: enriched males showed increased exploratory behaviour towards juvenile rats in comparison to control males, whereas no differences were found in females. No effects of E in social discrimination memory were observed. In the EPM, both enriched male and female rats showed less anxious behaviour than non-enriched animals."
"Acetaldehyde, the most toxic metabolite of ethanol, has been implicated in many toxic effects of ethanol. In the present study, we used rats to investigate the possible changes on the sleep-wake cycle and brain regional concentrations of noradrenaline and serotonin after intraperitoneal administration of several doses of acetaldehyde. Results showed that acetaldehyde significantly decreases the time spent in rapid eye movements sleep and wakefulness and increases the time spent in slow-wave sleep. The neurochemical analysis showed that acetaldehyde significantly increases the 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid content and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid/serotonin ratio at the bulb and pons. These results suggest that acetaldehyde modifies the metabolism of serotonin which has been implicated in the onset and sustaining of the sleep episodes occurring along the sleep-wake cycle."
"Physiological need states can influence goal-directed behavior by modulating the neural circuitry underlying the rewarding effects of stimuli and behaviors. Direct electrical stimulation of this circuitry produces a powerful rewarding effect, which is called brain stimulation reward. Chronic food restriction resulting in body weight loss potentiates brain stimulation reward, but in only in a subset of cases. This could reflect individual differences between rats or subtle difference in electrode location that lead to differential excitation of functionally different components of the neural circuitry underlying brain stimulation reward. To distinguish between these views, the influence of chronic food restriction on brain stimulation reward was assessed in rats bearing multiple stimulation electrodes. In 5 of 13 cases, the rewarding effects produced by stimulating different sites in the same rat were altered differentially by weight loss. This finding is interpreted in terms of the subdivision of brain reward circuitry along functional and anatomical lines."
"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the fourth most common psychiatric disorder. It is associated with somatic complaints like pain problems. Only a proportion of persons exposed to traumatic events develop PTSD. Several factors, like genetic predisposition, stressor intensity, cognitive appraisal mechanisms and coping processes influence the likelihood of developing PTSD after exposure to a trauma. We used a single session of footshocks in rats, an animal model with a high degree of validity for PTSD, to study whether individual behavioural traits predict long-term stress-induced sensitisation of behavioural responsivity and somatic pain sensitivity and therefore can act as a vulnerability factor. Rats were selected for low (LA) and high (HA) open-field locomotor reactivity and then underwent a single session of footshocks. Two to 5 weeks after footshocks, behavioural sensitisation was investigated using a noise challenge, an electrified prod challenge and a forced swim test. Somatic pain sensitivity was measured using a tail-immersion test. During exposure to noise in a novel cage, footshocked rats showed increased immobility compared to controls, which was significantly greater in LA than in HA rats. Footshocked rats showed increased burying in the electrified prod challenge and no effect was found in the forced swim test. Footshocks caused hyperalgesia in LA rats, but hypoalgesia in HA rats. We conclude that low open-field locomotor reactivity predicts the degree of stress-induced behavioural sensitisation and the direction of altered somatic pain sensitivity, suggesting that an anxiety-prone personality or passive coping style may increase the risk of developing stress-related psychosomatic disorders."
"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the fourth most common psychiatric disorder. It is associated with cardiovascular disorders and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Besides stressful life-events, a prior history of gastrointestinal infection is a predisposing factor for the development of IBS. Only a proportion of persons exposed to traumatic events develop PTSD. Several factors, like genetic predisposition, stressor intensity, cognitive appraisal mechanisms and coping processes influence the likelihood of developing PTSD after exposure to a trauma. We used a single session of footshocks in rats, an animal model with a high degree of validity for PTSD, to study whether transient colonic inflammation alters local and distal visceral sensitivity, and whether reactivity to the open-field (low (LA) or high (HA) active) predicts long-term stress-induced behavioural and cardiovascular sensitisation and altered visceral pain sensitivity. A distention series and noise challenge were given 2 weeks after foot-shocks, followed by a transient colonic inflammation period and a second distention series and noise challenge 4 weeks after foot-shocks. During exposure to noise, both before and after inflammation, footshocked rats showed increased immobility compared to controls, which was significantly greater in LA rats than in HA rats. LA preshocked rats also showed a greater blood pressure response to the noise test, but this only became evident in the second noise-test. Neither footshocks nor colonic inflammation affected duodenal pain sensitivity. The results provide additional evidence for long-lasting cardiovascular hyperresponsivity after a stressful event and indicate that its degree is predicted by personality traits or coping style."
"The aim of this study was to examine spatial and object recognition reference and working memory in adult offspring of Wistar rats exposed to ethanol in prenatal and/or preweaning period. For this purpose, four different conditions of the Can test were performed sequentially: spatial/object discrimination task, spatial orientation task, simple object recognition task and complex object recognition task. The results of present study shows: (1) the significant impairment in spatial learning and object recognition in animals exposed to alcohol during prenatal and/or preweaning period, (2) that cognitive dysfunction become increasingly evident with switching from simple to more sophisticated task, (3) that the most vulnerable period is the early neonatal period which corresponds to the third trimester gestational development in humans and (4) that during the developmental period, abrupt introduction or withdrawal of ethanol, rather than its continuous consumption, can produce higher cognitive deficit later on. In conclusion, moderate ethanol exposure during brain development produce long lasting impairment of spatial and recognition reference and working memory in adult rat's offspring and these effects depend on the developmental period in which they were exposed to ethanol."
"Our study investigates whether macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) are able to make spatial choices in a real space according to abstract visual stimuli presented on a computer screen. We tested whether there was a difference in the processing of stimuli reflecting the configuration of a response space (""spatial stimuli"") and stimuli of simple geometrical patterns lacking implicit spatial information. We trained two monkeys to choose one of nine touch-holes on a transparent panel attached to a computer monitor according to one of four visual stimuli successively displayed on the screen. The first monkey followed the visual stimuli designed as a representation of the response space (""configurations""), the second monkey observed geometrical patterns or pictures without information about the response space. In the first phase the position or the size of the stimuli varied but the shapes remained the same. In the second phase we changed the stimuli - ""configurations"" represented the response space in a similar way as in the previous phase, but marked different touch-holes - the patterns were changed entirely. The comparison of these two monkeys using different stimuli was expected to reveal potential differences between pattern discrimination and using configuration information included in the stimuli. The results of this experiment showed that both monkeys were able to use visual stimuli in phase 1 effectively (independently on their position on the screen), but only the monkey that obtained configuration information learnt an effective strategy after the change of stimuli in phase 2."
"The ability of mice to solve a complex task by observational learning was investigated with C57BL/6j mice. Four female demonstrators were trained to reliably perform a sequence that consisted in pushing a piece of food into a tube attached to the side of a puzzle box, and recovering it by opening a drawer in front of the box. They then performed this sequence in front of naive mice assigned to individual cubicles in a box with a wire mesh front arranged in a row facing the demonstrators. A total of 25 naive mice (13 males and 12 females) were used. Fifteen mice observed 14 demonstrations a day for 5 days; 10 control mice were placed in similar cubicles, but behind a plastic screen which prevented them from observing the demonstrators. The mice were post-tested in the demonstrator situation, and 6 of 15 observers immediately reproduced the complete task successfully, but none of the naive or control mice were able to solve the task. The observers and controls were then subjected to a five level individual learning schedule. Observers learned the individual task significantly faster than the controls. No sex difference was found. These results suggest that observational learning processes at work were based on stimulus enhancement and observational conditioning."
"Transient prenatal vitamin D deficiency produces hyperlocomotion in the adult rat. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of acute restraint on the behaviour of DVD and control rats in the open field. Rats were conceived and born to developmentally vitamin D (DVD) deficient or replete (control) dams and, at 8 weeks of age, were monitored for 30 min in an open field using automated video tracking software. Half of the rats were restrained within a towel for 5 min immediately before the open field test. The remainder received minimal handling prior to the open field test. Repeating previous findings, DVD deficient animals had enhanced locomotion during the first 10 min of the open field test compared to control rats. By contrast, there were no differences in locomotor activity after acute restraint stress. The time rats spent in the corners and side of the open field was affected by prenatal diet. DVD rats spent less time in the corners and more time in the side than control rats across the whole 30 min test. This difference was not seen in rats with acute restraint stress. The time spent in the centre was not altered by prenatal diet or acute restraint. Thus, transient prenatal vitamin D deficiency induces a transient spontaneous hyperlocomotion in adulthood that is modulated by acute restraint stress."
"Recently, we described an advanced model of chronic social stress in male rats based on the resident intruder paradigm. In this model, rats subjected to daily social stress for 5 weeks showed behavioral changes resembling anhedonia and motivational deficits in humans. In the present study, male Wistar rats were subjected to 5 weeks of daily social defeat by an aggressive conspecific and concomitant treatment with the antidepressant drug fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) after the first week of stress. Compared with controls, rats exposed to chronic stress had significantly reduced locomotor and exploratory activity (rearing and sniffing) and diminished preference for sucrose solution. These effects were paralleled by decreased body weight gain, increased adrenal weights and decreased plasma levels of testosterone measured post mortem. The stress-induced effects on locomotor activity and rearing behavior were counteracted by fluoxetine treatment."
"Although alteration to peripheral systems at the skeletal muscle level can contribute to one's ability to sustain endurance capacity, neural circuits regulating fatigue may also play a critical role. Previous studies demonstrated that increasing brain serotonin (5-HT) release is sufficient to hasten the onset of exercise-induced fatigue, while manipulations that increase brain dopamine (DA) release can delay the onset of fatigue. These results suggest that individual differences in endurance capacity could be due to factors capable of influencing the activity of 5-HT and DA systems. We evaluated possible differences in central fatigue pathways between two contrasting rat groups selectively bred for high (HCR) or low (LCR) capacity running. Using quantitative in situ hybridization, we measured messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B autoreceptors, dopamine receptor-D2 (DR-D2) autoreceptors and postsynaptic receptors, and dopamine receptor-D1 (DR-D1) postsynaptic receptors, in discrete brain regions of HCR and LCR. HCR expressed higher levels of 5-HT1B autoreceptor mRNA in the raphe nuclei relative to LCR, but similar levels of TPH, 5-HTT, and 5-HT1A mRNA in these areas. Surprisingly, HCR expressed higher levels of DR-D2 autoreceptor mRNA in the midbrain, while simultaneously expressing greater DR-D2 postsynaptic mRNA in the striatum compared to LCR. There were no differences in DR-D1 mRNA levels in the striatum or cortex between groups. These data suggest that central serotonergic and dopaminergic systems may be involved in the mechanisms by which HCR have delayed onset of exercise-induced fatigue compared to LCR."
"Elevated corticosterone in the amygdala leads to cautious avoidance behaviors on the elevated plus maze. The current study examined the effect of elevated corticosterone in the amygdala on corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) mRNA levels in the bed nuclei of stria terminalis (BNST). Exposure to the elevated plus maze increased CRF mRNA in both the dorsolateral and ventrolateral BNST. Corticosterone implants in the amygdala potentiated this effect in the dorsolateral, but not ventrolateral BNST. Corticosterone also resulted in an increased number of neurons expressing CRF in the dorsolateral BNST in response to the behavioral stimuli."
"We have developed a two-lever choice reaction-time (RT) task to investigate the behavioral and neural mechanisms of stimulus-response compatibility in rats. In the task, the rat pressed two levers with its forepaws during the preparation period of each trial, and then quickly responded to an air-puff stimulus on its left or right forepaw by releasing the lever on the same side (compatible condition) or the opposite side (incompatible condition) of the stimulus. Twenty rats successfully learned the task in both the compatible and incompatible conditions. Two stimulus-response compatibility effects were observed: the RT was shorter and the error rate was lower in the compatible condition than in the incompatible condition. The trial sequence also affected the results and a speed-accuracy tradeoff was observed. These results are consistent with those reported for human RT tasks. Furthermore, a lesion in the forepaw-sensorimotor cortex caused increases in the RTs for stimulus detection and/or response movement with the contralateral forepaw, suggesting that the task was mediated by this brain area. We conclude that this instrumental task for rats can be regarded as a model for human RT tasks and can be used to investigate the neural basis of the compatibility effects."
"We aimed to analyze whether hypertension and changes in nitric oxide (NO) generation are associated with alterations of locomotor activity in rats. Male Wistar rats treated with an inhibitor of NO synthase, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 40 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks, control Wistar rats, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and control Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) aged 18 weeks were investigated. Locomotor activities were tested by the open field method. NO synthase activity (NOS), concentration of cGMP and conjugated dienes (CD) as well as protein expression of nuclear factor NF-kappaB were determined in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and brainstem. NOS activity in the brain parts investigated was not changed in SHR in comparison with the normotensive WKY. L-NAME treatment resulted in the decreased NOS activity in comparison with Wistar rats. The concentration of CD and expression of NF-kappaB protein, markers of reactive oxygen species, were higher and the concentration of cGMP was lower in hypertensive animals and more pronounced in SHR as well. Thus, the concentration of NO in the brain parts of SHR might be lower than in the L-NAME treated rats. L-NAME treatment increased horizontal (by 28%) and vertical (by 80%) motor activity. Similarly, in SHR both locomotor activities were increased by 105% and 148%, respectively, in comparison with WKY. In conclusion, decreased level of NO was associated with increased locomotor activity indicating that in addition to genetic differences which may determine changes in locomotor activity in hypertensive rats, the role of a signalling pathway mediated by NO may be supposed."
"To investigate the functional role of Desert hedgehog (Dhh) gene in the nervous system, we examined motor, sensory, learning and memory functions as well as mood in Dhh knockout (KO) mice. Dhh KO male mice exhibited prolonged immobility time compared with wild-type male mice in the forced swimming test, and showed enhanced inhibition in the Vogel's conflict model. These findings suggest that Dhh KO male mice exhibited enhanced anxiety and depressive behavior compared with wild-type male mice. In contrast, Dhh KO female mice did not show any significant difference compared to wild-type female mice. These behavioral abnormalities of Dhh KO male mice may be due to lower testosterone levels with abnormal development of the testes caused by Dhh-null mutation."
"The response threshold hypothesis of division of labour in honey bees assumes that individuals differ in their responsiveness to different stimulus modalities. However, previous experiments have shown that responsiveness to gustatory stimuli correlates with responsiveness to odours, pollen and tactile stimuli. Evaluation of these stimuli involves sensory receptors on the antenna. We tested whether responsiveness to gustatory stimuli correlates with responsiveness to visual stimuli in a phototaxis experiment, which is independent of antennal input. Gustatory responsiveness was measured using the proboscis extension response to antennal stimulation with water and different sucrose concentrations. Phototaxis was quantified by measuring the walking times a bee needed to reach light sources of different intensities. Walking behaviour in the darkness was measured to test for differences in locomotor behaviour. The walking time towards a light stimulus, the path length, and the walking speed depended on the intensity of the light stimulus. Responsiveness to visual stimuli correlated significantly with gustatory responsiveness. Bees displaying a high gustatory responsiveness were also very sensitive to light. Locomotor activity did not correlate with gustatory responsiveness. This shows that gustatory responsiveness is a good indicator of sensitivity for visual stimuli, which are not perceived by the antenna."
"Clinical observations suggest that certain gut and dietary factors may transiently worsen symptoms in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), epilepsy and some inheritable metabolic disorders. Propionic acid (PPA) is a short chain fatty acid and an important intermediate of cellular metabolism. PPA is also a by-product of a subpopulation of human gut enterobacteria and is a common food preservative. We examined the behavioural, electrophysiological, neuropathological, and biochemical effects of treatment with PPA and related compounds in adult rats. Intraventricular infusions of PPA produced reversible repetitive dystonic behaviours, hyperactivity, turning behaviour, retropulsion, caudate spiking, and the progressive development of limbic kindled seizures, suggesting that this compound has central effects. Biochemical analyses of brain homogenates from PPA treated rats showed an increase in oxidative stress markers (e.g., lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation) and glutathione S-transferase activity coupled with a decrease in glutathione and glutathione peroxidase activity. Neurohistological examinations of hippocampus and adjacent white matter (external capsule) of PPA treated rats revealed increased reactive astrogliosis (GFAP immunoreactivity) and activated microglia (CD68 immunoreactivity) suggestive of a neuroinflammatory process. This was coupled with a lack of cytotoxicity (cell counts, cleaved caspase 3' immunoreactivity), and an increase in phosphorylated CREB immunoreactivity. We propose that some types of autism may be partial forms of genetically inherited or acquired disorders involving altered PPA metabolism. Thus, intraventricular administration of PPA in rats may provide a means to model some aspects of human ASD in rats."
"Prenatal stress is an important risk factor in schizophrenia, and the aetiological factors mediating this relationship are central to the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist dexamethasone (DEX) is commonly prescribed for prenatal conditions, and results in GR activation, which is part of the stress response. To investigate animal evidence for whether prenatal DEX leads to development of schizophrenia-like phenotypes, Wistar rats were prenatally exposed to DEX (0.1mg/kg/day) between the gestational days 15 and 21, and tested in two paradigms known to be disrupted in schizophrenia patients: prepulse inhibition (PPI) and latent inhibition (LI). A cross-fostering design was used to allow dissociation of any direct prenatal effects on offspring from effects dependent on DEX exposure of the rearing dam. Pup birth weight was reduced by prenatal DEX treatment. DEX-treated dams demonstrated increased pup-directed behaviour. There were additive effects of prenatal DEX treatment and DEX treatment of rearing dam in terms of reduced body weight in adulthood. In one of two replications, PPI was increased by prenatal DEX in males only and specific to the highest prepulse intensity. There was no evidence that LI was disrupted by prenatal DEX treatment. This study does not provide support for the hypothesis that prenatal DEX exposure leads to schizophrenia-like deficits in PPI or LI, suggesting that GR prenatal programming is not a mechanism of direct relevance to the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia."
"Deficits in social interaction are primary characteristics of autism, which has strong genetic components. Genetically manipulated mouse models may provide a useful research tool to advance the investigation of genes associated with autism. To identify these genes using mouse models, behavioral assays for social relationships in the background strains must be developed. The present study examined colony formation in groups of one male and three female mice (Experiment 1) and, groups of three male mice (Experiment 2) of the C57BL/6J strain in a semi-natural visible burrow system. For adult mixed-sex colonies, 4-h observations during both the dark and light cycles for 15 days demonstrated day-dependent increases in huddling together in the chamber accompanied by decreased frequencies of active social behaviors. Sequential analyses of social interactions indicated that approaches to the back of the approached animal typically elicited flight, while approaches to the front of the approached animal failed to do so. This was seen for female to female, and for female to male approaches, as well as male to female approaches, strongly counterindicating a view that rear approach/flight specifically reflects female responsivirity to unwanted male sexual approach. For adult male colonies, similar protocols found that these social behaviors were similar to those of adult mixed-sex colonies. These findings suggest two potentially useful measures of eusocial behavior in mice, of possible value for genetic mouse models of autism; that is, huddling together and approaches to the front but not the back, of conspecifics."
"Rhythmic discharges of neurons are believed to be involved in information processing in both sensory and motor systems. However their fine structure and functional role need further elucidation. We employed a pattern-based approach to search for episodes of precisely rhythmic activity of single neurons recorded in different brain structures in behaving cats and rabbits. We defined discharge patterns using an algorithmic description, which is different from the previously suggested template methods. We detected episodes of precisely rhythmic discharges, specifically, triads of constant (precision +/-2.5%) inter-spike intervals in the 10-70 ms range. In 54% (67/125) of neurons tested, these patterns could not be explained by random occurrences or by steady or slowly changing input. Rhythmic patterns occurred at a wide range of inter-spike intervals, and were imbedded in non-rhythmic activity. In many neurons, timing of these precisely rhythmic patterns was related to different locomotion tasks or to respiration."
"The widely accepted stress-diathesis hypothesis of depression postulates that genetic factors contribute to biological vulnerability. Based on this concept, the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) animal model was developed. Most effects of UCMS can be reversed by antidepressant agents, illustrating a strong predictive validity. In rodents, UCMS also has good face validity as it can elicit depression-like symptoms. While abundant for rats, the UCMS literature on mice is relatively limited. Reports sometimes are contradictory, making it difficult to establish a clear profile of stress-induced depression-like behaviors in mice. As different groups often use different strains for their experiments, differential strain susceptibility to UCMS may provide at least a partial explanation of these discrepancies. Moreover, differences in testing methodology add another level of complexity. Very little is known about the role of genetic factors and their interactions with the environment in the development of stress-induced behavioral changes relevant to depression, though recent studies unequivocally demonstrated the effects of specific gene polymorphisms on stress-induced depressive symptoms, as well as the effects of stress on gene expression. In the present study, we investigated the effects of UCMS on a battery of different tests measuring anxiety and depression-like behaviors in three behaviorally and genetically distinct inbred strains. The goals of these experiments are to obtain a clearer behavioral profile of genetically/phenotypically distant mouse strains after UCMS treatment and to evaluate the limitations and strengths of the UCMS model in mice."
"The infusion of autologous blood into the brain of rats is a widely used model of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Careful assessment of functional recovery is an essential part of preclinical testing (e.g., putative cytoprotectants). However, few tests detect long-term deficits in this model. In this study, we used the staircase and single pellet tests to characterize skilled reaching ability after striatal ICH. Rats were trained to reach for food pellets in these tasks before ICH, which was created by infusing 100muL of autologous blood into the striatum. We assessed reaching success in both tasks for 5 days starting 7 and 28 days after ICH. We counted the number of reaching attempts made with each forelimb in the staircase task and performed kinematic analysis of reaching in the single pellet task. The contralateral (to lesion) forelimb reaching success was significantly impaired in the staircase task 1 week after ICH, but this recovered to pre-surgical levels thereafter. Reaching deficits in the single pellet task were more severe and persistent. Detailed analysis of reaches on day 11 revealed several abnormalities in the following movement components: pronation, grasping, supinating the paw and releasing the pellet. At 1 month, only digit opening and supination were impaired. Accordingly, the single pellet task is better at detecting long-term skilled reaching impairments in the whole blood model of ICH. Thus, the single pellet task seems suited to cytoprotection and rehabilitation studies."
"We investigated the association between variation in parenting style and the offspring's behaviour and CSF monoamine metabolite (5-HIAA, HVA, and MHPG) levels in rhesus monkeys. Study subjects were 25 two-year-old females reared by their biological mothers and 15 same-aged females that were crossfostered at birth and reared by unrelated mothers. Subjects that were rejected more by their mothers in the first 6 months of life engaged in more solitary play and had lower CSF concentrations of 5-HIAA than subjects that were rejected less. The relation between these variables was generally similar in crossfostered and noncrossfostered females. CSF levels of 5-HIAA were negatively correlated with rates of scratching, a behavioural indicator of anxiety. These results suggest that that early exposure to high rates of maternal rejection can result in higher anxiety later in life, and that this effect may be mediated by serotonergic mechanisms. Variation in maternal protectiveness did not affect offspring behaviour and neither protectiveness nor rejection affected CSF levels of HVA and MHPG. CSF levels of MHPG, however, were negatively correlated with solitary play behaviour and avoidance of other individuals, suggesting that individuals with lower CSF MHPG were more fearful and socially phobic than those with higher CSF MHPG. Taken together, these findings suggest that individual differences in anxiety and fearfulness in young rhesus monkeys are accounted for, at least in part, by variation in CSF levels of monoamine metabolites, and that the development of brain monoamine systems, particularly serotonin, can be affected by early exposure to variable maternal behaviour."
"Impulsivity is an important symptom of many psychiatric disorders, and can be divided into two subtypes: response inhibition deficits and delay aversion. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between delay aversion and response inhibition, both to each other and to locomotion, extinction of conditioned responses, sexual behaviour, and aggressive behaviour. To that end, we quantified the behaviour of 24 rats in several tests. To measure response inhibition, rats were trained in a stop-signal task. In this operant task, rats were rewarded food if they inhibited execution of a response after presentation of an audible stop-signal. Delay aversion was measured in an operant task in which rats made a choice between a small, immediately available reward and a large reward available after a delay. The results showed that delay aversion and response inhibition were independent. Responses during extinction and various measures of aggressive behaviour were positively correlated to delay aversion. The speed of go-trials in the stop-task was correlated to non-aggressive behaviour. We conclude that the role of response inhibition in various behaviours is small, but delay aversion in particular contributes to several other behaviours, such as aggressive behaviour and extinction."
"In a series of three experiments, simple reaction time (RT) was characterized with respect to a variable preparatory interval (PI) in order to investigate the relationship between interval timing and RT. In Experiment 1, it was shown that RT decreases as a function of PI and that this effect varies with amount of training. In Experiment 2, RT was shown to increase during probe trials that used a novel 6.25s PI, suggesting that the specific durations of the PIs encoded during initial training contribute to the PI effect on RT. In Experiment 3, 100 microg/kg i.p. of raclopride proportionally slowed RT as a function of the PI. These results are discussed within the context of neuropsychological models of interval timing and support an underlying role for cortico-striatal dopaminergic function in temporal processing and simple RT measurements."
"Weaning is one of the most important events in early mammalian life. We investigated the influence of early weaning on the development of neuroendocrine responses to stress in mice. Our study indicated that precocious weaning augments anxiety and aggressiveness in mice, and the lack of mother-pup interaction from postnatal days 15-21 may account for this phenomenon. A litter of Balb/cA mice was divided into two groups, with one group weaned at postnatal day 14 (early weaned) and the other at day 21 (normally weaned). Baseline levels of corticosterone, corticosterone response to the moderate stress of exposure to the elevated plus maze test, and hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA expression levels in the mice were assayed at the age of 3, 5, and 8 weeks. At 8 weeks, basal corticosterone levels in early-weaned males were higher than those of normally weaned males. Also at 8 weeks, the early-weaned mice showed a higher anxiety level in the elevated plus maze test, and responded with greater levels of corticosterone secretion than the normally weaned mice. GR expression in the early-weaned mice was higher at 3 weeks but lower at 8 weeks. These GR changes were observed only in male mice. These results suggest that early weaning increases anxiety and enhances neuroendocrine responses to stress and thus modulates the development of the neuroendocrine stress system."
"Clinical observations suggest that abnormalities within the cerebellum and/or the cerebellum--cholinergic forebrain connections may be key to explain the severe behavioral deficits and increases in seizures seen in autism. In order to explore functional relationships between brain areas implicated in many of the core behavioral features of autism, experiments utilizing animal models for specific autism-like behaviors have increased in recent years. In the current study, we used a rodent model for the autism-like behavior of environment exploration deficits to examine the role of the cerebellum and its connectivity to the forebrain. In addition, due to the possible common neural pathways between seizures and autism-like behaviors, we explored the possibility for limiting autism-like behaviors via antiseizure brainstem and cerebellar circuitry. In two experiments, adult male rats showed a significant decrease in exploration behavior following developmental cerebellar suction lesions (experiment 1) or i.c.v. saporin injections specifically targeting Purkinje cells, but not after the addition of saporin-induced cholinergic forebrain lesions (experiment 2). In both experiments, the anticonvulsant treatment of inhibition of the medullary nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) restored exploration behavior to control levels. These findings suggest that specific neuronal populations within the cerebellum are responsible for mediating exploration behavior, and these neuronal populations are similar to the circuitry involved in limbic motor seizures in that they are sensitive to brainstem inhibition. Furthermore, these results suggest this connection could be utilized in order to control behavioral deficits seen in autism with treatments, such as vagal nerve stimulation, which are effective against pharmaco-resistant seizures."
"Reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior can be elicited by a systemic priming injection of cocaine or a non-selective biogenic amine transporter inhibitor. In order to determine which biogenic amine is responsible for this effect, selective dopamine (GBR 12909), serotonin (fluoxetine) or norepinephrine (nisoxetine) transporter inhibitors were systemically administered in order to assess their ability to induce cocaine seeking in rats. Administration of GBR 12909, but not nisoxetine or fluoxetine, dose-dependently reinstated cocaine seeking in rats. Furthermore, administration of the non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist flupenthixol into the nucleus accumbens shell attenuated GBR 12909-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. These results suggest that increases in extracellular concentrations of dopamine, specifically in the nucleus accumbens shell, are primarily responsible for promoting cocaine priming-induced reinstatement of drug seeking in rats."
"Genetic selection for chickens of high (HGPS) and low (LGPS) group productivity and survivability, resulted in two distinct genetic lines characterized by differences in cannibalism, flightiness, and immunocompetence. Additionally, birds exhibited differences in behaviour and social stress coping strategy. HGPS birds have a superior stress coping strategy compared with birds of LGPS or Dekalb XL (DXL), a commercial strain. Line differences in stress response and behaviour could be due to selection-induced differences in expression of the dopaminergic system. The dopamine (D2) receptor, an integral part of the dopaminergic system, was hypothesized to be a key contributory factor of the stress response. We tested this hypothesis by injecting either a D2 antagonist (raclopride) or saline in the dominant individual in pair-housed birds for 10 days and examining stress coping ability. Results showed that dominant birds of all strains showed a reduced frequency of aggressive pecks on subordinates following raclopride injection. In contrast, subordinates paired with raclopride-injected birds increased pecking frequency. Two days after stopping injections, LGPS and DXL birds returned to pre-injection levels of aggressive threats, while HGPS birds maintained depressed frequency of threats. Strain differences in aggressive responsiveness coincided with increased epinephrine levels in raclopride treated LGPS birds relative to control LGPS birds, but not by HGPS and DXL birds. Our findings suggest a functional linkage between the genetic basis of stress coping ability and the dopamine regulation of aggressive responsiveness. The data further indicate that the sympathetic-adreno-medullary axis is directly involved in regulating both stress coping strategy and aggressiveness."
"Evidence that NMDA receptors contribute to synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus has stimulated research on their role in behavioral learning and memory. Recent studies indicate that NMDA antagonists decrease use of place strategies by rats in a T-maze task that can be solved using either a ""place"" or ""response"" strategy. In the present study, rats were given MK-801 before maze exposure and/or training on this redundant strategy T-maze task. MK-801 did not impair rats' ability to learn the task, but did change the strategies they used on a probe trial administered after learning. MK-801 decreased use of place strategies only when administered before both maze exposure and training; rats given MK-801 only before maze exposure or only before training tended to use place strategies on the probe trial. These results show that MK-801 does not prevent rats from utilizing previously acquired spatial information, but does appear to impair the acquisition of spatial information needed for place strategies."
"Recent evidence suggest that encoding of spatial information based on extended surfaces may differ from encoding based on discrete arrays of local elements. Here we investigated the use of these different frames of reference in domestic chicks. Chicks were trained to search for food hidden under sawdust in the center of the floor of a square-shaped landmark array, with its center in coincidence with the center of a square-shaped enclosure. Displacement of the array to a corner caused a shift of searching behavior toward the array, the search activity spanning between the center of the arena and the center of the array. After changing distances between landmarks, chicks still searched in the central area. Asymmetries were apparent in chicks tested in monocular conditions, with left-eyed chicks being more affected by the overall enclosure and right-eyed chicks by local landmarks. These results suggest that chicks can use both distances from extended surfaces and local information provided by the landmarks of the array to orient in space. However, chicks do not seem to perceive the array as a whole configuration, rather they tend to rely only on single landmarks to locate the goal."
"The impairments in the maternal behavior of ovariectomized sensitized females, relative to lactating dams, resemble those deficits found in lactating females after treatment with the D1/D2 DA receptor antagonist haloperidol, which interferes with maternal motivation. Therefore, it could be speculated that these behavioral deficits found in sensitized females and haloperidol-treated dams are due to a reduced motivation to interact with pups. In support of this hypothesis, we have found that both sensitized and haloperidol-treated lactating females exhibited remarkably similar impairments in the expression of all active maternal behaviors relative to lactating dams. Furthermore, these deficits were overridden when they were allowed to interact with 12h-isolated pups (demanding pups). Interestingly, lactating dams also improved their maternal behavior in the presence of demanding pups, and clearly chose demanding more than non-demanding pups in a preference paradigm. These data support the idea that the behavioral deficits of sensitized and haloperidol-treated lactating females are due to a reduced behavioral activation in response to the incentive cues from pups compared to lactating dams, and not because of a motor inability to express maternal behavior. These findings ultimately suggest that pups modulate the activity of DA system involved in the regulation of maternal behavior."
The experiments herein investigate whether the behavioral responses to transient and episodic vestibular disruption and permanent ablation are distinct in the absence of climbing fiber input. Subjects in group 1 received an IP injection of PBS followed by an IP injection of niacinamide. Seven days later these rats received the first of 3 serial transtympanic injections of TTX on the same side with 7 days between each injection. Following each TTX injection rats displayed unilateral vestibular symptoms that persisted beyond 48h. Spontaneous barrel rolling behavior was not observed. Group 2 subjects received an IP injection of 3-acetylpyridine (3-AP)+niacinamide followed by the same TTX regimen as group 1. Following each TTX injection vestibular symptoms (severe body twisting and persistent spontaneous barrel rolling) emerged rapidly (&lt;15min) and resolved by 72h. Group 3 subjects received an IP injection of 3-AP+niacinamide and 7 days later a single unilateral transtympanic injection of sodium arsanilate. Rats in group 3 developed vestibular symptoms similar to those observed in group 2 although there was no resolution of these symptoms. The results indicate that TTX has a rapid rate of infiltration and blockade of the VIIIth nerve that persists for &gt;48h and then completely resolves. The contrast in vestibular symptoms between groups 1 and 2 suggest that climbing fibers are recruited soon after onset of vestibular disruption and play a role in attenuating the severity of vestibular symptoms associated with transient/episodic vestibular disruption.
"Environmental enrichment (EE) has beneficial neurobiological, physiological and behavioral effects. The purpose of the present paper is to review the animal research literature pertaining to the impact of EE on altering physiological and behavioral anxiety outcomes. Evidence supports the view that EE attenuates responses to certain anxiety provoking situations, and that these effects persist over time. Specifically, EE attenuates behavioral anxiety-type responses and endocrine responses mediated via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis evoked by psychogenic and/or neurogenic stressors. EE is not only able to protect from excessive anxiety in response to a present stressor, but also attenuates the enduring or persistent effects engendered by past psychogenic stressor(s) such as prenatal stress or neonatal maternal separation. It is noteworthy that the protective effects of EE are particularly apparent in animals that are highly anxious or when the task is highly challenging for the subject. Various mechanisms of action of EE have been proposed, ranging from behavioral/cognitive to cellular/molecular processes. A pronounced variability in the enrichment protocols used by different investigators may account for some of the inconsistencies noted in the effect of EE on behavioral (e.g. anxiety) and endocrine (e.g. plasma corticosterone) responses. Although the occasional inconsistencies highlight the need for further research, a preponderance of the animal research data indicates that EE exerts therapeutic and protective (anxiolytic) effects against (a) impending threat, (b) enduring effects of past stressor(s) and (c) subsequent stressors."
"Pregnancy and motherhood are life-altering events that result in a number of hormonal, neural and behavioral changes in the mother. Motherhood has been shown to influence spatial learning and memory performance of the mother. In turn new research has shown that reproductive experience (number of times pregnant and mothered) plays a significant role on spatial learning and memory performance. How long these changes persist after weaning and the role of pregnancy and/or mothering on these changes have yet to be fully investigated. The present study aimed to determine whether enhanced spatial working and/or reference memory in the mother is evident long after weaning and whether these effects are due, in part, to pregnancy or 'mothering' alone. Five groups of age-matched rats: multiparous, primiparous, nulliparous, pregnant-only and sensitized rats were tested approximately 1 month after weaning/pup-exposure, or 55 days after birth, on the spatial working/reference version of the radial arm maze. Results show that regardless of error type (reference or working memory errors), primiparous rats make fewer errors compared to multi- and nulli-parous rats, with a trend to enhanced memory compared to sensitized rats. In addition, pregnant-only rats completed the task on significantly fewer days than primiparous, multiparous, nulliparous and sensitized rats. Clearly the combination of first pregnancy and first mothering experience has a significant impact on hippocampus-dependent learning and memory performance in the mother."
"The subiculum has a central position between the hippocampus proper and entorhinal and other cortices, as well as a range of subcortical structures. The functional role of subiculum within the hippocampal formation circuit remains largely unexplored and a theoretical and experimental consensus on its functions has yet to emerge. Presented here is a simple and speculative model of the functions of the subiculum, based partly on anatomical, behavioural and neurophysiological considerations. The model suggests, firstly, that the subiculum acts to amplify hippocampal output, given the prominent bursting behaviour of its neurons and, secondly, that there is a dorso-ventral segregation of function within the subiculum. The dorsal component appears principally concerned with the processing of information about space, movement and memory, whereas the ventral component appears to play a major regulatory role in the inhibition of the HPA axis."
"Violence is associated with prefrontal deficits in humans, suggesting that this brain area inhibits aggressiveness. Its role, however, remains controversial, as certain subdivisions of the prefrontal cortex become activated by fights in rodents. Disparate human findings also show that this area is acutely activated by aggression under certain conditions. We explored prefrontal neuronal activation patterns in resident rats exposed to psychosocial (sensory contact with the intruder) and aggressive encounters. Both psychosocial and aggressive encounters increased c-Fos activation in the prelimbic (PrL), anterior cingular (Cg1), agranular insular (AI), ventral (VO) and lateral orbital (LO) cortices. The infralimbic (IL) and medial orbital (MO) cortices were activated significantly by aggressive encounters only. No other prefrontal regions were activated by psychosocial or aggressive encounters. The overwhelming majority of activated cells were pyramidal (glutamatergic) cells in the Cg1, IL, PrL, MO, and VO, whereas interneuron and pyramidal cell activation was similar in AI and LO. When rats showed violent aggression, the activation of GABAergic inhibitory cells decreased in these two, and two other areas (IL and MO). Notably, the latter two areas appeared to be specifically involved in aggressive behavior. The change occurred in a recently developed model of violent aggression. In this model, pyramidal cell activation in the above mentioned four areas (IL, MO, AI, and LO) predicted over 95% of variation in attack counts in general and violent attacks in particular. Based on these data, we present a tentative hypothesis on the involvement of the prefrontal cortex in the control of aggression."
"Higher testosterone level in males is one of the most obvious possibilities for the development of a clear gender difference in ADHD. The present study focused on the influence of excessive androgen exposure in the developmental stage on the hyperactivity feature of ADHD. The study used the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) as an animal model. The amount of locomotion activity previously used as an over-activity measure in the SHR has resulted in a complicated picture. While the general activity level of SHR was significantly higher than its progenitor-the Wistar Kyoto rat (WKY), comparative differences with the Wistar rat could be observed only under certain experimental conditions. The present study applied the scaling approach to assess open field behaviors from a qualitative aspect. Although SHR and Wistar rats showed similar locomotion amounts, movement patterns differed significantly, as indicated by the spatial scaling exponent. Androgen treatment during the early postnatal developmental stage significantly increased total path lengths only in the male SHR. Effects of the hormone manipulation were not expressed in the scaling measurement. The scaling approach conclusively provides a different aspect of open field behaviors and also reacts differently as the total path length to excessive early testosterone exposure."
"The hippocampus has been implicated in the regulation of anxiety and memory processes. Nevertheless, the precise contribution of its ventral (VH) and dorsal (DH) division in these issues still remains a matter of debate. The Trial 1/2 protocol in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) is a suitable approach to assess features associated with anxiety and memory. Information about the spatial environment on initial (Trial 1) exploration leads to a subsequent increase in open-arm avoidance during retesting (Trial 2). The objective of the present study was to investigate whether transient VH or DH deactivation by lidocaine microinfusion would differently interfere with the performance of EPM-naive and EPM-experienced rats. Male Wistar rats were bilaterally-implanted with guide cannulas aimed at the VH or the DH. One-week after surgery, they received vehicle or lidocaine 2.0% in 1.0 microL (0.5 microL per side) at pre-Trial 1, post-Trial 1 or pre-Trial 2. There was an increase in open-arm exploration after the intra-VH lidocaine injection on Trial 1. Intra-DH pre-Trial 2 administration of lidocaine also reduced the open-arm avoidance. No significant changes were observed in enclosed-arm entries, an EPM index of general exploratory activity. The cautious exploration of potentially dangerous environment requires VH functional integrity, suggesting a specific role for this region in modulating anxiety-related behaviors. With regard to the DH, it may be preferentially involved in learning and memory since the acquired response of inhibitory avoidance was no longer observed when lidocaine was injected pre-Trial 2."
"A growing body of functional imaging studies suggests that human depression and anxiety symptoms are associated with functional abnormalities in the circuitry formed by the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and its direct limbic and paralimbic connections. In rodents however, the role of the rACC (rCG1/rCG2) remains unknown in depression-related behaviours and elusive in acute anxiety. In order to address this, we specifically lesioned the rat rCG1/rCG2, and assessed the behavioural outcome using a modified forced swim test (FST) and the elevated plus maze (EPM), tests for depression and anxiety related behaviours respectively. Lesions of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex significantly increased the time spent immobile in the FST without affecting climbing or swimming performances, suggesting a pro-depressant effect. On the contrary, none of the parameters measured in the EPM was affected by the lesion. These data point to an involvement of the rCG1/rCG2 in depression-related coping behaviours."
"Restricted, repetitive behavior, along with deficits in social reciprocity and communication, is diagnostic of autism. Animal models relevant to this domain generally fall into three classes: repetitive behavior associated with targeted insults to the CNS; repetitive behavior induced by pharmacological agents; and repetitive behavior associated with restricted environments and experience. The extant literature provides potential models of the repetitive behavioral phenotype in autism rather than attempts to model the etiology or pathophysiology of restricted, repetitive behavior, as these are poorly understood. This review focuses on our work with deer mice which exhibit repetitive behaviors associated with environmental restriction. Repetitive behaviors are the most common category of abnormal behavior observed in confined animals and larger, more complex environments substantially reduce the development and expression of such behavior. Studies with this model, including environmental enrichment effects, suggest alterations in cortical-basal ganglia circuitry in the development and expression of repetitive behavior. Considerably more work needs to be done in this area, particularly in modeling the development of aberrant repetitive behavior. As mutant mouse models continue to proliferate, there should be a number of promising genetic models to pursue."
"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are male-biased and characterized by deficits in social behavior and social communication, excessive anxiety or hyperreactivity to stressful experiences, and a tendency toward repetitiveness. The purpose of this review is to consider evidence for a role for two sexually dimorphic neuropeptides, oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (VP), in these features of ASD. Both VP and OT play a role in normal development. VP is androgen-dependent and of particular importance to male behavior. Excess VP or disruptions in the VP system could contribute to the male vulnerability to ASD. Alternatively, protective processes mediated via OT or the OT receptor might help to explain the relatively rare occurrence of ASD in females. Disruptions in either OT or VP or their receptors could result from genetic variation or epigenetic modifications of gene expression, especially during early development. Deficits in other developmental growth factors, such as reelin, which may in turn regulate or be regulated by OT or VP, are additional candidates for a role in ASD."
"Autism is a developmental brain disorder characterized by deficits in social interaction, language and behavior. Brain imaging studies demonstrate increased cerebral cortical volumes and micro- and macro-scopic neuroanatomic changes in children with this disorder. Alterations in forebrain serotonergic function may underlie the neuroanatomic and behavioral features of autism. Serotonin is involved in neuronal growth and plasticity and these actions are likely mediated via serotonergic and glutamatergic receptors. Few animal models of autism have been described that replicate both etiology and pathophysiology. We report here on a selective serotonin (5-HT) depletion model of this disorder in neonatal mice that mimics neurochemical and structural changes in cortex and, in addition, displays a behavioral phenotype consistent with autism. Newborn male and female mice were depleted of forebrain 5-HT with injections of the serotonergic neurotoxin, 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), into the bilateral medial forebrain bundle (mfb). Behavioral testing of these animals as adults revealed alterations in social, sensory and stereotypic behaviors. Lesioned mice showed significantly increased cortical width. Serotonin immunocytochemistry showed a dramatic long-lasting depletion of 5-HT containing fibers in cerebral cortex until postnatal day (PND) 60. Autoradiographic binding to high affinity 5-HT transporters was significantly but transiently reduced in cerebral cortex of 5,7-DHT-depleted mice. AMPA glutamate receptor binding was decreased at PND 15. We hypothesize that increased cerebral cortical volume and sensorimotor, cognitive and social deficits observed in both 5-HT-depleted animals and in individuals with autism, may be the result of deficiencies in timely axonal pruning to key cerebral cortical areas."
Abusers of phencyclidine (PCP) often present with a symptom profile similar to that exhibited by schizophrenic patients. Animal models utilising such psychotomimetics are currently informing research into the condition. Accumulating evidence suggests that a central cognitive deficit in schizophrenia is the inability to use task-setting cues to guide goal directed behaviour and that this ability is mediated by prefrontal dopamine (DA). The current study used the non-competitive NMDA antagonist phencyclidine (PCP) and Haloperidol (typical antipsychotic) and Clozapine (atypical antipsychotic) in order to further investigate the influence of DAergic manipulation on a task that requires the use of conditional information to inform goal-directed performance. An instrumental conditional discrimination task was employed in which rats learn to respond appropriately according to the presence of specific auditory conditional stimuli. Probe test 1 showed impaired conditional discrimination performance following sub-chronic PCP administration (seven twice-daily injection protocol) compared to control which was reversed by acute treatment with clozapine (5 mg/kg) but not haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg) both administered 60 min pre-test. Probe test 2 (8 days post-treatment) showed enduring deficits to conditional discrimination performance that were again reversed by clozapine but not haloperidol (injection procedures as above). These results show that tasks dependent upon conditional relationships are particularly sensitive to manipulation of DAergic systems as prolonged treatment with PCP has been shown to selectively reduce prefrontal cortex (PFC) DA activity and treatment with clozapine (known to ameliorate cognitive deficits) but not haloperidol has been shown to selectively restore PFC DA levels.
"Members of the ADAM family (adisintegrin and metalloprotease) are the main candidates for physiologically relevant alpha-secretases. The alpha-secretase cleaves in the non-amyloidogenic pathway the amyloid precursor protein within the region of the Abeta peptides preventing their aggregation in the brain. The increase of alpha-secretase activity in the brain provides a plausible strategy to prevent Abeta formation. Concerning this possibility two transgenic mouse lines (FVB/N) have been created: mice over-expressing the bovine form of the alpha-secretase (ADAM10) and mice over-expressing an inactive form of the alpha-secretase (ADAM10-E348A-HA; ADAM10-dn). For behavioral examination a F1 generation of transgenic mice (C57Bl/6 x FVB/N (tg)) was generated and compared to wild type F1 generation (C57Bl/6 x FVB/N). Behavior was characterized in the following tasks: standard open field, enriched open field, elevated plus-maze, and the Morris water maze hidden platform task. Concerning basal activity, exploration, and anxiety, transgenic mice behaved similar to controls. With respect to learning and memory both transgenic lines showed a significant deficit compared to controls. ADAM10 mice however, showed thigmotaxis with passive floating behavior in the Morris water maze indicating differences in motivation, whereas, ADAM10-dn mice displayed an inconspicuous but limited goal-directed search pattern. Thus variation of the enzymatic activity of alpha-secretase ADAM10 alters learning and memory differentially. Nevertheless, it could be concluded that both, ADAM10 and ADAM10-dn mice are suitable control mice for the assessment of alpha-secretase-related effects in animal models of Alzheimer's disease."
"Palatability is one of the factors that regulates food and fluid intake and contributes to overconsumption in turn contributing to obesity. To elucidate the brain mechanisms of the palatability-induced ingestion, we explored the roles of six hypothalamic orexigenic neuropeptides, orexin, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related protein (AgRP), ghrelin and dynorphin, in the intake of a palatable solution, saccharin. Of the six peptides, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administrations of orexin, MCH and NPY increased the intake of saccharin. Drinking of saccharin in turn elevated the mRNA levels of orexin and NPY, but not MCH. Pre-treatments of naloxone, an opioid antagonist, blocked the orexigenic effects of orexin and NPY. Specific gastric motor responses induced by central orexin-A and NPY are well known, however, MCH did not induce such responses. The i.c.v. administration of orexin-A facilitated gastric emptying. These results suggest that the overconsumption promoted by sweet and palatable tastes is attributed to the activation of orexigenic neuropeptides, such as orexin and NPY, and a downstream opioid system together with enhanced digestive functions."
"Adult male, but not female, rats demonstrate a suppression in hippocampal cell proliferation in response to an acute predator odour stress. The present study examined the effect of activational levels of androgens on stress-induced changes in hippocampal cell proliferation and defensive and non-defensive behaviours in adult male rats. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were castrated and exposed to trimethylthiazoline (TMT, the main component of fox feces). Androgen status did not significantly affect TMT-induced suppression in hippocampal cell proliferation or expression of defensive burying. However, castrated males did not show an increase in duration of stretch attends (a risk assessment behaviour) in response to TMT. The results of this study suggest that activational levels of androgens in the male rat do not directly regulate the sex difference in stress-induced suppression of hippocampal cell proliferation but do regulate risk assessment behaviour."
"This study examined the density of dopamine transporter (DAT) and D2 receptors in the brains of chronic high-fat diet-induced obese (cDIO), obese-resistant (cDR) and low-fat-fed (LF) control mice. Significantly decreased DAT densities were observed in cDR mice compared to cDIO and LF mice, primarily in the nucleus accumbens, striatal and hypothalamic regions. D2 receptor density was significantly lower in the rostral part of caudate putamen in cDIO mice compared to cDR and LF mice."
"Previous exposure to amphetamine attenuates its ability to induce conditioned taste aversion (CTA). Because amphetamine, unlike emetic agents like LiCl, possesses appetitive properties that sensitize when it is administered repeatedly, the present study assessed the contribution of sensitization to this US-pre-exposure effect (US-PEE). It was found that not all sensitizing regimens of systemic amphetamine injections produce a US-PEE. In addition, previous exposure to amphetamine in the VTA, where it acts to induce sensitization but not CTA, did not produce a US-PEE. It is concluded that amphetamine sensitization alone does not modulate this drug's ability to produce CTA. Implications of these findings for anatomically based associative and non-associative models of CTA and the US-PEE are discussed."
"Neurohormones like testosterone and estrogen have an important role in learning and memory. Many biological effects of androgens in the brain require the local conversion of these steroids to an estrogen. The current research has conducted to assess the effect of testosterone, estrogen and aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole) on spatial discrimination of rats, using Morris water maze and also the pathway of the effect of testosterone by using anastrozole. Adult male rats were bilaterally cannulated into CA1 region of hippocampus and divided into 15 groups. Different groups received DMSO 0.5 microl and DMSO 0.5 microl + DMSO 0.5 microl as control groups and different doses of testosterone enanthate (TE) (20, 40 and 80 microg/0.5 microl), estradiol valerat (EV) (1, 2.5, 5, 10, and 15 microg/0.5 microl), anastrozole (An) (0.25, 0.5, 1 microg/0.5 microl), TE 80 microg/0.5 microl + anastrozole 0.5 microg/0.5 microl and EV 15 microg/0.5 microl + anastrozole 0.5 microg/0.5 microl all days before training. TE and EV were injected 30-35 min before training and anastrozole was injected 25-30 min before training. Our results have shown both TE 80 microg/0.5 microl and EV 15 microg/0.5 microl groups increase in escape latency and traveled distance to find invisible platform. Also we have shown that anastrozole dose dependently decreases escape latency and traveled distance. We resulted that both TE and EN impaired acquisition of spatial learning and memory but anastrozole improved it. Anastrozole also could be buffered TE-induced impairment effect but not EV."
"Most of literature on language has shown how different word-classes activate distinct neural networks within linguistic cortical areas. The present investigation aimed to demonstrate that, by means of slow evoked potentials and using the same set of words in different tasks, it is possible to activate cortical networks that are spatially and temporally distinguished. Twenty healthy subjects had to evaluate, in a word pair matching session, whether two words rhymed (phonological task), were semantically related (semantic task) or were written in the same letter case (orthographic task). Slow wave amplitude was computed in three relevant time windows: the last 0.5 s of first word presentation (W1), the initial contingent negative variation (iCNV) and the terminal CNV (tCNV). During W1 and iCNV intervals, both the orthographic and the phonological tasks were left lateralized. Furthermore, the phonological task was more lateralized than the orthographic because of a greater inhibition of the right hemisphere, whereas the orthographic task was characterized by a greater bilateral posterior activation. During the tCNV, only the phonological task remained left lateralized while orthographic and semantic were bilaterally distributed. Although the use of the same set of words tends to activate widely overlapped networks, in the present research task manipulation was effective in demonstrating task dependent differences in brain lateralization. Thus, the present paradigm and the adopted tasks are especially suited for studying deficit and recovery of language in patients affected by linguistic disorders such as developmental dyslexia and aphasia."
"The effects of upper lumbar level intrathecal injection of yohimbine, an alpha2-noradrenergic antagonist, on overground locomotion in intact rats was studied. This treatment caused dose-dependent impairment of hindlimb locomotor movement, which varied from transient hindlimb paralysis at a dose of 200 microg/20 microl to transient trunk instability at 50 microg/20 microl. Repetitive (every 48 h) injections of yohimbine at high (200 microg/20 microl) and medium (100 microg/20 microl) doses caused tachyphylaxis, which usually led to a lack of reaction to the third injection. This phenomenon was not observed after repetitive injections of the low (50 microg/20 microl) dose of the drug. These results show that the noradrenergic system is involved in the control of locomotion, since intrathecal administration of a specific antagonist affects this activity in intact rats."
"The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) has been shown to exhibit behavioral characteristics analogous to those exhibited by humans diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The present study was conducted to further evaluate the validity of the SHR model of ADHD by characterizing learning of a novel response under conditions of delayed reinforcement. Seven experimentally na&#xef;ve SHRs and a control group of seven normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were exposed to a contingency where one lever press initiated pellet delivery after a 15-s, resetting delay. Rats in both groups acquired lever pressing, and the pattern of acquisition was well described with a three-parameter, sigmoidal equation. Response acquisition was retarded in the SHRs; they took longer to acquire the behavior, exhibited lower response rates and earned fewer reinforcers over the course of the experiment. When reinforcer delivery was made immediate in a subsequent condition, the SHRs exhibited higher response rates than the WKY, suggesting that the lower rates of responding seen in the SHRs were due to the reinforcer delay. The results replicate previous research on response acquisition with delayed reinforcement and provide further validation of the SHR strain as a model of ADHD. Like humans diagnosed with ADHD, the SHRs appear to be hypersensitive to delayed consequences, which in the present context, interfered with learning a novel behavior."
"There is a unidirectional, ipsilateral and monosynaptic projection from the hippocampus to the prefrontal cortex. The cognitive function of hippocampal-prefrontal cortical circuit is not well established. In this paper, we use muscimol treated rats to investigate the roles of the hippocampal-prefrontal cortical circuits in spatial working memory, as assessed with a delayed spatial alternation task. First of all, the effect of muscimol on EEG power of infusion area was observed for confirmation of the dosage of muscimol to inhibit the function of infusion area. The results show that the EEG power of the ventral hippocampus and the prelimbic area of the prefrontal cortex were inhibited by local infusion of muscimol (0.5 microg in 0.25 microl PBS) into the above areas, respectively. Delayed alternation performance was significantly impaired when muscimol at this dosage was infused (1) bilaterally into the ventral hippocampus, (2) bilaterally into the prelimbic area, (3) unilaterally into the ventral hippocampus and simultaneously contralaterally into the prelimbic area. Infusion of muscimol either unilaterally into the ventral hippocampus or unilaterally into the prelimbic area did not impair delayed alternation performance. The present results suggest that any structures in this circuit is damaged or inhibited bilaterally, the spatial working memory will be disrupted. It means the hippocampal-prefrontal cortical circuit plays an important role in spatial working memory."
"Prenatal stress in rats has been shown to impair the regulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and predispose to anxiogenic and depressive-like behaviour. In a previous study, abolition of excess corticosterone (COR) release during stress by maternal adrenalectomy prevented the dysregulation of the HPA axis. In the present study, we determined whether excess maternal COR is also responsible for the alterations in offspring behaviour. Pregnant Wistar rats were adrenalectomized or sham-operated on day 11 of gestation and subjected once daily to mild restraint for 30 min on days 14-21 of gestation. An undisturbed group of pregnant females served as controls. All experiments were performed in male and female offspring. Pup weight and anogenital distance of males were measured after birth; anxiogenic behaviour was assessed in the elevated plus maze (EPM) at the age of 5 weeks and spatial memory in the Morris water maze in littermates at 3-4 months. Prenatally stressed (PS) males did not show a reduction in anogenital distance, and their increase in anxiogenic behaviour in the EPM was less than that in PS females. On the other hand, impairment of spatial learning was only seen in PS males. Both the anxiogenic behaviour of PS males and females and the learning deficit in males were completely abolished by adrenalectomy. These data show that excess stress-induced COR can alter the programming of the foetal brain and predispose it to alterations in behaviour that are gender specific."
"Behavioral and physiological changes were studied following prolonged exposure to social competition in pairs of non-food-deprived rats competing daily for a limited supply of graham cracker crumbs. Stable dominant-subordinate relationships developed in most pairs, as measured by feeding time, which were maintained over a 5-6-week study period. In other behavioral tests, subordinates demonstrated a decreased latency to immobility in the forced swim test compared with dominants, but no difference in locomotor activity. Subordinates had increased bladder size, decreased adrenal gland size, and a 35% reduction of hippocampus cell proliferation compared with the dominant member. Therefore, prolonged social competition, based on restricted access to palatable substances, produced hierarchies among individuals that were associated with differences in behavior, physiology and hippocampal cell proliferation."
"Spatial generalization skills in school children aged 8-16 were studied with regard to unfamiliar objects that had been previously learned in a cross-modal priming and learning paradigm. We observed a developmental dissociation with younger children recognizing objects only from previously learnt perspectives whereas older children generalized acquired object knowledge to new viewpoints as well. Haptic and--to a lesser extent--visual priming improved spatial generalization in all but the youngest children. The data supports the idea of dissociable, view-dependent and view-invariant object representations with different developmental trajectories that are subject to modulatory effects of priming. Late-developing areas in the parietal or the prefrontal cortex may account for the retarded onset of view-invariant object recognition."
"Effects of concurrent intracerebroventricular administration of amyloid-beta peptide 25-35 (Abeta(25-35)) and the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) to rats were investigated. A battery of behavioral tests including radial arm maze, passive avoidance, elevated plus-maze and forced swim test as well as histological methods were used. A single administration of Abeta(25-35) induced delayed behavioral deficits manifested in reference and working memory disturbances in the radial maze task involving spatial memory. However, no effects of Abeta(25-35) on learning or retention in a passive avoidance test could be revealed. Abeta(25-35) appeared to decrease anxiety without affecting depression-like behavior in the rats. Abeta(25-35)-induced cognitive deficits could be related to the moderate neuronal cell loss found in the hippocampal CA1 field. Though administration of TNFalpha did not impair learning and memory of rats in the radial maze, it induced gross changes in their behavior during passive avoidance training. Though TNFalpha did not protect against Abeta(25-35)-induced neuronal cell loss in the CA1 field of hippocampus, co-administration of TNFalpha with Abeta(25-35) resulted in an improvement of reference memory impaired by the amyloid peptide, but not of working memory."
"In addition to morphological changes, global cerebral ischemia leads to functional changes that can be assessed by behavioral examination. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the duration of global cerebral ischemia on the time course of a comprehensive set of motor behaviors in Mongolian gerbils. The common carotid arteries of gerbils were occluded either for 5 min, 10 min, or 15 min. Gerbil motor behavior was recorded in the open field at 24 h, 48 h, 4 days, 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, and 28 days after reperfusion. Each session lasted for 60 min and was composed of six intervals of 10 min. Our results revealed that ischemic gerbils quickly develop locomotor and stereotypic hyperactivity, with the expected decrease of resting time. The most evident effect was observed in gerbils submitted to a 15 min ischemia, whose locomotor activity returned to nearly normal values after 7 days. In contrast, the duration of global cerebral ischemia had no effects on rearing, clockwise, or counter-clockwise rotation. These findings indicate that exposure to global cerebral ischemia induces changes in locomotion, stereotypy, and resting time. The magnitude and duration of these effects depend on the duration of ischemia."
"The complex behavioral symptoms and neuroanatomical abnormalities observed in autistic individuals strongly suggest a multi-factorial basis for this perplexing disease. Although not the perfect model, we believe the Engrailed genes provide an invaluable ""window"" into the elusive etiology of autism spectrum disorder. The Engrailed-2 gene has been associated with autism in genetic linkage studies. The En2 knock-out mouse harbors cerebellar abnormalities that are similar to those found in autistic individuals and, as we report here, has a distinct anterior shift in the position of the amygdala in the cerebral cortex. Our initial analysis of background effects in the En1 mouse knock-out provides insight as to possible molecular mechanisms and gender differences associated with autism. These findings further the connection between Engrailed and autism and provide new avenues to explore in the ongoing study of the biological basis of this multifaceted disease."
"Although the increasing rate of obesity has stimulated interest in the effects of diet composition on peripheral systems, comparatively little work has been done to examine effects upon the brain. A diet high in fat is one of many factors that can promote obesity, and previous research has shown that such a diet can produce learning and memory impairment in rodents. In the present study, C57BL/6 mice were placed on either a high-fat (45% kcal fat) or regular (5% kcal fat) diet, and examined at different points during the subsequent year. The high-fat diet led to increased weight gain, significant impairment in glucoregulation, and altered insulin-mediated signaling within the hippocampus, an area of the brain believed to be important for the acquisition of memory. Following ten months on either diet, synaptic function in ex vivo hippocampal slices was examined, and neither stimulus-response curves nor electrically induced long-term potentiation were found to be different. As well, performance in the Morris water maze, a hippocampal-dependent test of spatial memory, was not influenced by diet. However, mice consuming a high-fat diet failed to perform an operant bar-pressing task, indicating a significant impairment to procedural learning and consolidation processes. Despite causing broad peripheral changes in C57BL/6 mice, consuming a large proportion of calories from saturated fat had only a limited effect upon learning and memory, which suggests that certain aspects of brain function are selectively vulnerable to the influences of diet."
"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) on circulating lipoproteins (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglycerides) in males as well as in intact and ovariectomized (OVX) female rats. The intact female rat group was sub-distributed according to the phase of the estrous cycle (proestrus, estrus and diestrus) allowing for comparison of the lipid profile with males and OVX rats. The results indicate that PSD significantly reduced cholesterol in intact females compared to OVX and male rats; it reduced triglycerides in all groups except in diestrus rats and increased HDL levels in male rats compared with the respective controls. PSD also increased LDL levels in male and OVX rats when compared to intact females. Examinations of cholesterol fractions revealed significant increases in HDL in control-OVX animals when compared to the other groups, whereas HDL was significantly increased after PSD in male rats. Such results suggest that the cardiovascular response in intact, OVX females and male rats is differentially regulated especially when such are submitted to PSD. Similarities in blood parameters observed between OVX and male rats are likely due to the suppression of ovarian hormone release after ovariectomy."
"Separation from the maternal nest alters the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stress response in adult male rats, but little research has addressed how separation affects female rats. The following experiments investigated how early maternal separation from postnatal day (PND) 2 to 14 affected stress-induced corticosterone and ACTH after exposure to an open field in juvenile and adult female rats. Female rats were separated for 5 h daily from mother and littermates (early deprivation: ED), separated from mother but not littermates (maternal separation: MS), or animal facility reared (AFR). Male siblings were left with the mother rat during separation. Female rats were exposed to an open field arena either during the juvenile period (PND 30) or during adulthood (PND 80-100). Results show that ED juvenile female rats showed a lower corticosterone stress response than MS and AFR female rats when measured at 5 min post-stress, but no difference at 20 or 60 min post-stress. In adulthood, ED female rats showed comparable elevations of corticosterone as MS and AFR rats at 5 min post-stress but lower elevations at 20 min. In terms of behavior, there were no significant effects of early experience. However, in adulthood, ED and MS rats tended to show a decreased proportion of inner grid crossings of the open field compared to AFR rats, suggesting a tendency for increased anxiety in these two separation groups."
"Dopaminergic agonists, such as apomorphine and amphetamine, have been shown to drastically reduce prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex. The effects of the indirect dopamine agonist cocaine on prepulse inhibition have only been described in a few reports and have yielded conflicting results, possibly due to individual differences within and between rat strains. In this study we therefore used apomorphine-susceptible and apomorphine-unsusceptible rats, as an animal model for individual differences, to study the effects of cocaine (20, 30 mg/kg i.p.) on prepulse inhibition. In addition we tested whether the cocaine-induced deficit in prepulse inhibition could be reversed by the D2-antagonist remoxipride (5 mg/kg i.p.), the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (2.5 mg/kg i.p.) and the 5-HT2-antagonist ketanserin (2.0 mg/kg i.p.). Cocaine strongly reduced prepulse inhibition in apomorphine-susceptible rats, but had no effect at all on apomorphine-unsusceptible rats. Remoxipride had no effect on prepulse inhibition, but prazosin and ketanserin increased prepulse inhibition. Both remoxipride and prazosin reversed the cocaine-induced deficit in prepulse inhibition, whereas ketanserin did not. We conclude that apomorphine-susceptible rats are extremely sensitive to the effects of cocaine on prepulse inhibition, while apomorphine-unsusceptible rats are not. The effects of cocaine on prepulse inhibition in apomorphine-susceptible rats were mediated by D2-receptors, but not by 5-HT2-receptors or alpha-1 adrenoceptors."
"Theories of the neurobiological basis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have largely focused on dysregulation of central dopaminergic function. However, other neurotransmitter systems may be implicated in specific cognitive deficits in ADHD. Interest in the potential involvement of nicotinic cholinergic systems in ADHD has arisen in part from the observation that adolescents and adults with ADHD smoke cigarettes at significantly higher rates than people without this disorder. In addition, several studies report that nicotine alleviates ADHD symptoms, and recent neuro-genetics studies indicate that cholinergic systems may be altered in persons with ADHD. In this review, we describe the evidence for a role of central nicotinic cholinergic systems in cognitive deficits in ADHD. We also propose mechanisms by which alterations in cholinergic function may contribute directly and/or indirectly to these deficits. Finally, we identify specific paradigms and models to guide future investigations into the specific involvement of nicotinic cholinergic systems in ADHD, possibly leading to the development of more effective pharmacotherapies for ADHD."
"The intracerebroventricular administration of the tridecapeptide neurotensin (NT) produces strong analgesic effects in tests evaluating acute pain. We investigated whether these effects are mediated by the opioid receptors. In the hot plate test, the NT receptors agonist NT1 (N(alpha)Me-Arg-Lys-Pro-Trp-Tle-Leu), s.c. injected (0.3-3 mg/kg), increased paw licking and jump latencies. These effects were inhibited by the NTS2 antagonist levocabastine (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) but not by the selective NTS1 antagonist SR48692 (3 mg/kg, i.p.). The opioid receptor antagonist naloxone did not modify (up to the dose of 4.5 mg/kg, s.c.) the NT1 effect on licking, but abolished the increase in the jump latency (from the dose of 1.5 mg/kg). In mice made tolerant to the analgesic effect of morphine (2 mg/kg, s.c.) by previous morphine injections (32 mg/kg, s.c., twice a day, 4 days), NT1 maintained its effect on licking, but its effect on jump latency was suppressed. Levocabastine (up to the dose of 4.5 mg/kg) failed to antagonize the effects of morphine (2 mg/kg, s.c.) on both licking and jump latencies. In mice made tolerant to the analgesic effect of NT1 (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.) by previous NT1 injections (3 mg/kg, s.c., twice a day, 4 days) morphine maintained its analgesic effects both on licking and jumping latencies. We can conclude that neurotensinergic and opioidergic transmissions are functionally independent as regards the licking response. However, in the jump response, neurotensinergic transmission seems to regulate opioidergic transmission, inducing its stimulation."
"The influence of reduced feedback from the cutaneous receptors in the hindpaw in rat locomotion is still unclear. To evaluate this question, we conducted a detailed hindlimb kinematic analysis in animals, which suffered complete loss of thermal sensation. Two-dimensional hindlimb kinematics, temporal and spatial measurements, and walking track analysis were performed in rats before and during hypothermic anesthesia. The walking velocity, duration of the step cycle and stance phase, and stride length between the two testing conditions were statistically indistinguishable. Swing phase duration was significantly decreased during sensory loss. Analysis of angular motion revealed an increased hip and knee extension and an ankle joint with increased flexion during the step cycle under plantar anesthesia. Also after plantar cooling, the hip and knee angular velocity was significantly affected along the step cycle. The remarkably geometric similarity of the angle-angle plots obtained in our experiments reflected an interjoint coordination; however, the interpretation of the cyclogram perimeter revealed a larger excursion by the ankle and hip in their respective joint spaces in rats deprived of sensation. Examination of the horizontal position of the ankle with respect to the hip and the extension before toe-off revealed no major changes, whereas, there was a slight decrease in distance of the hip to the ground during sensory loss. Also, the walking tracks revealed a significant functional deficit following reduced cutaneous information of the plantar aspect of the hindpaw. We therefore conclude that sensory feedback from the hindpaw is important in the maintenance of normal rat locomotion."
"Non-human primates, like humans, develop and maintain social relationships and attachments throughout their life. The first and most crucial relationship in a primate life is that with its mother. Yet, in absence of their biological mother, infant primates form attachment to surrogate mothers. Although, this early attachment is critical for the development of normal species-typical social and emotional skills, the neural substrates underlying the formation of social relationships in primates are still unclear. The present study assessed, in infant rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) reared by human caregivers and social interactions with peers, the effects of bilateral neonatal (1-2 weeks of age) ibotenic acid lesions of the amygdala and hippocampus (N=6 in each group), aspiration lesions of the orbital frontal cortex (N=6) or sham lesions (N=5) on the development of a social attachment with the principal human caregiver. A specific preference for the later was assessed at 11 months of age, in a two-choice discrimination task, opposing the principal human caregiver to another familiar human, in a familiar environment. None of the lesions impaired the expression of preferential responses toward the principal human caregiver. Nevertheless, lesions of the orbital frontal cortex led to a weaker preference, suggesting that this structure may play a role in the quality and/or strength of the infant/mother relationships. The present non-human primate findings are discussed in terms of their relevance for autism."
"Adolescence is characterized by behavioral traits such as emotional lability and impulsivity that are associated with increased vulnerability to affective illness and addictions. Research in rodents has found that adolescent rats and mice differ from adults on measures of anxiety-like behavior, novelty seeking and stress-responsivity. The present study sought to extend these data by evaluating fear-, anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in male C57BL/6J mice aged four (early adolescent), six (peri-adolescent) or eight (early adult) weeks of age. Age groups were compared on: Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction, anxiety-like behavior and exploratory locomotion (using elevated plus-maze and novel open field), and depression-related behavior (via forced swim test). Results showed that early adolescent mice exhibited enhanced fear conditioning, but extinguished at a similar rate as adults. There were no major differences in anxiety-like behavior across age groups, although early adolescent and peri-adolescent mice exhibited less exploratory locomotion than adults. Depression-related immobility behavior in the forced swim test was lower in early adolescents than adult mice across three test exposures. Present findings in the C57BL/6J inbred strain add to growing evidence of changes in rodent fear- and stress-related behaviors across the developmental transition from juvenility through adulthood. Understanding the neural basis of these ontogenic changes could provide insight into the pathogenesis and treatment of affective disorders that have their origins in adolescence."
"Antidepressants are usually prescribed for the treatment of depression but more recently have also been recommended for the treatment of anxiety disorders. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anxiogenic- or anxiolytic-like effects of an acute administration of antidepressants (serotonergic and noradrenergic compounds) in male Wistar rats submitted to the elevated plus-maze. Fluoxetine (2.5, 5, 10, 15mg/kg), paroxetine (0.1, 0.5, 3, 12mg/kg) and desipramine (2.5, 5, 10mg/kg) or their vehicles were administered intraperitoneally 30min prior to testing. Diazepam (0.5, 1.5, 2.5mg/kg) was used as a positive comparator for anxiolytic effect. In comparison with control animals, the percentage of time the rats treated with fluoxetine (5 and 10mg/kg) and paroxetine (3 and 12mg/kg) spent in the open arms decreased. The percent of inactive time spent in the open arms also decreased in rats given fluoxetine (5 and 10mg/kg) and paroxetine (12mg/kg). Desipramine was inactive on all these parameters. In conclusion, acute treatment with fluoxetine and paroxetine, but not with desipramine, produced a pattern of anxiety behavior. Thus, the pharmacological mechanism appears to be due more to serotonergic than adrenergic neurotransmission. The elevated plus-maze exhibits good sensitivity for detecting anxiogenic effects of antidepressant drugs and the conventional parameters are sufficient and reliable for detecting such effects."
"The midbrain dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG) is part of the brain defensive system involved in active defense reactions to threatening stimuli. Corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) is a peptidergic neurotransmitter that has been strongly implicated in the control of both behavioral and endocrine responses to threat and stress. We investigated the effect of the nonspecific CRF receptor agonist, ovine CRF (oCRF), injected into the DPAG of mice, in two predator-stress situations, the mouse defense test battery (MDTB), and the rat exposure test (RET). In the MDTB, oCRF weakly modified defensive behaviors in mice confronted by the predator (rat); e.g. it increased avoidance distance when the rat was approached and escape attempts (jump escapes) in forced contact. In the RET, drug infusion enhanced duration in the chamber while reduced tunnel and surface time, and reduced contact with the screen which divides the subject and the predator. oCRF also reduced both frequency and duration of risk assessment (stretch attend posture: SAP) in the tunnel and tended to increase freezing. These findings suggest that patterns of defensiveness in response to low intensity threat (RET) are more sensitive to intra-DPAG oCRF than those triggered by high intensity threats (MDTB). Our data indicate that CRF systems may be functionally involved in unconditioned defenses to a predator, consonant with a role for DPAG CRF systems in the regulation of emotionality."
"Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, characterised by severe degeneration of basal ganglia, motor abnormalities, impaired cognitive function and emotional disturbances. Many of the distinct neuropathological features of HD are reproduced in rats by intrastriatal injections of the excitotoxin quinolinic acid (QA), and QA-induced excitotoxicity is partially prevented by administration of the A(2A) receptor antagonist prior to the QA injection. In this study, we assessed the neuroprotective effects of the adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonist SCH 58261 on the progressive behavioural alterations reported in the QA rat model of Huntington's disease. Male rats received i.p. SCH 58261 (0.01mg/kg) or vehicle 20min before a bilateral injection of quinolinic acid (QA, 300nmol/1mul) or its vehicle in the dorsal striatum. Motor activity and anxiety levels were analyzed in an open-field arena and in an elevated plus-maze at 2 weeks, 2 months and 6 months post-lesion. In QA-lesioned rats SCH 58261 prevented alterations of wall rearing behaviour starting from 2 weeks post-lesion while emotional changes (reduced anxiety) were back to control levels by 6 months post-lesion. These findings extend to the behavioural parameters the protective effects of SCH 58261 in the QA model of Huntington's disease."
"It has been argued that damage to the perirhinal cortex should impair visual discriminations when the stimuli have overlapping features. In Experiment 1, rats with perirhinal cortex lesions were trained on a series of visual discriminations in a water tank, culminating in a biconditional discrimination. No evidence was found of a perirhinal lesion deficit, although the same rats showed an object recognition deficit. In Experiment 2 the lesions were extended to involve both the perirhinal and postrhinal cortices in a new group of rats. An impairment was now found on acquisition of the biconditional task, but this was not specific as impairments were also found on two elemental visual discriminations. Taken together, the study failed to find evidence that the rat perirhinal cortex is necessary for configural visual discriminations and so revealed that some ambiguous visual discriminations can be learnt when this area is removed. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the parahippocampal region is selectively dedicated to configural learning, even though the loss of this area can impair the acquisition of some configural tasks."
"The aim of the present study was to investigate whether environmental enrichment changes the effects of acute stress on both the release of dopamine and acetylcholine in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and working memory performance. Male Wistar rats (3 months of age) were housed in enriched or control conditions during 12 months. Behavioural testing was carried out to assess working memory performance in a delayed alternation task (water escape T-maze). Horizontal and vertical motor activity were also monitored in the open field. After behavioural testing (open field and water T-maze), animals were implanted with guide cannula in the PFC to perform microdialysis experiments and to monitor dopamine and acetylcholine extracellular concentrations. Handling stress (40min) produced similar increases of extracellular concentrations of dopamine in the PFC of both enriched and control animals. In contrast, handling stress increased significantly the extracellular concentrations of acetylcholine in the PFC of control, but not enriched, animals. Exposing animals to a lit open field during 10min significantly reduced working memory performance assessed immediately in the water T-maze just in control animals, though these effects were not significantly different between both groups of animals. Spontaneous motor activity in the open field was lower in enriched compared to control animals. These results suggest that environmental enrichment changes acetylcholine, but not dopamine, reactivity to stress in the PFC."
"In estrogen-primed female rats, vaginal cervical stimulation (VCS) provided by male intromissions or by an experimenter enhances estrous behaviors exhibited by females during subsequent mating with a male. We tested the hypothesis that alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors, acting via the nitric oxide-cGMP-protein kinase G pathway, mediate VCS-induced facilitation of female reproductive behaviors. Ovariectomized, estradiol-primed rats received intracerebroventricular (icv) infusions of vehicle or pharmacological antagonists 15 or 60min before VCS. Estrous behaviors (lordosis and proceptivity) in the presence of a male were recorded immediately (0min), and 120min following VCS. First we verified that VCS, but not manual flank stimulation alone, enhanced estrous behaviors when females received icv infusion of the vehicles used to administer drugs. Increased estrous behavior was apparent immediately following VCS and persisted for 120min. We then infused prazosin, phenoxybenzamine (alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonists), yohimbine, idaxozan (alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor antagonists), or propranolol (beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist) 15min prior to the application of VCS in females primed with 5mug estradiol benzoate. Only alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonists inhibited VCS facilitation of estrous behavior, apparent 120min after VCS. Finally, we administered specific inhibitors of soluble guanylyl cyclase, nitric oxide synthase or protein kinase G icv 15 or 60min before VCS. All three agents significantly attenuated VCS facilitation of estrous behavior. These data support the hypothesis that endogenously released norepinephrine, acting via alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors, mediates the facilitation of lordosis by VCS, and are consistent with a mechanism involving alpha(1)-adrenergic activation of the nitric oxide/cGMP/protein kinase G pathway."
"Emerging evidence suggests that cocaine and other drugs of abuse can interfere with many aspects of cognitive functioning. The authors examined the effects of 0.1-15mg/kg of cocaine on Pavlovian contextual and cued fear conditioning in mice. As expected, pre-training cocaine dose-dependently produced hyperactivity and disrupted freezing. Surprisingly, when the mice were tested off-drug later, the group pre-treated with a moderate dose of cocaine (15mg/kg) displayed significantly less contextual and cued memory, compared to saline control animals. Conversely, mice pre-treated with a very low dose of cocaine (0.1mg/kg) showed significantly enhanced fear memory for both context and tone, compared to controls. These results were not due to cocaine's anesthetic effects, as shock reactivity was unaffected by cocaine. The data suggest that despite cocaine's reputation as a performance-enhancing and anxiogenic drug, this effect is seen only at very low doses, whereas a moderate dose disrupts hippocampus and amygdala-dependent fear conditioning."
Previous lesion and neuroimaging studies have shown that the frontal lobes play an important role in response inhibition. In the present study event-related functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was applied to investigate cerebral blood oxygenation in the right and left prefrontal cortex (PFC) in 15 male participants during the performance of a stop-change paradigm. Data analysis showed stronger brain activation in the left and right PFC during successful and failed stopping of initiated responses in comparison to a condition without stopping. Changes in cerebral blood oxygenation were more pronounced in the right than in the left PFC. No substantial activation changes were found during successful or failed changing of initiated responses (response inhibition and subsequent response re-engagement). The findings indicate that NIRS is suitable for the functional identification of prefrontal activation during the inhibition of initiated responses and provide further support for the contribution of the PFC to response inhibition.
"The presence of insulin receptor in the hippocampus suggests that this organ is a target for insulin. However, unlike the classic peripheral insulin target tissues such as adipocyte, muscle and liver, where the primary function of insulin is to regulate glucose homeostasis, insulin in the central nervous system (CNS) exhibits more diverse actions, most of which have not been clearly understood. A direct role of hippocampal insulin receptor signaling in improving cognitive functions, including learning and memory, and the association of insulin receptor deterioration with brain degenerative dementia (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) have attracted increasing interest. Additionally it has been shown that insulin can be a neuroprotective agent against memory loss induced by ischemia, lesions and some pharmacological agents. In the present study we evaluate the hypothesis that the bilateral intra CA1 insulin injection can protects against stress-induced memory deficit. Chronic restraint stress (2h per day x 7 days) significantly impaired spatial performance in Morris water maze and elevated serum corticosterone level. Intrahippocampal insulin microinjection was done 15-20 min before every stress episode. Insulin in low dose (0.5 MU) had no significant effect on memory deficit induced by stress. But in higher doses (6 and 12 MU) insulin protects animals against the deleterious effect of stress. Insulin alone daily injection had no effect on water maze performance. These results suggest that spatial learning and memory is compromised during chronic stress and insulin may protect against this effect."
"Previously we reported that during protracted morphine abstinence rats show reduced conditioned place preferences (CPP) for food-associated environments, compared to non-dependent subjects. To determine the brain regions involved in this altered reward behavior, we examined neural activation (as indexed by Fos-like proteins) induced by a preference test for a food-associated environment in 5-week morphine-abstinent versus non-dependent animals. The results indicate that elevated Fos expression in the anterior cingulate cortex (Cg) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) correlated positively with preference behavior in all groups. In contrast, Fos expression in stress-associated brain areas, including the ventral lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (VL-BNST), central nucleus of the amygdala (CE), and noradrenergic (A2) neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) was significantly elevated only in morphine-abstinent animals. Furthermore, the number of Fos positive neurons in these areas was found to correlate negatively with food preference in abstinent animals. These results indicate that the altered hedonic processing during protracted morphine withdrawal leading to decreased preference for cues associated with natural rewards may involve heightened activity in stress-related brain areas of the extended amygdala and their medullary noradrenergic inputs."
"It was recently found that cooling the skin to temperatures as mild as 25-30 degrees C can induce nociceptive sensations (burning, stinging or pricking) that are strongly suppressed by dynamic contact between the thermode and skin (contact suppression). Here we investigated whether nociceptive sensations produced by menthol can be similarly suppressed. In the first experiment subjects rated the intensity of cold and burning/stinging/pricking sensations before and after application of 10% l-menthol to the forearm. Ratings were compared at resting skin temperature ( approximately 33 degrees C) and at 28, 24, or 20 degrees C during static or dynamic contact cooling via a Peltier thermode. At resting skin temperature, menthol produced cold and nociceptive sensations, both of which were suppressed by dynamic contact. When the skin was cooled during static contact, menthol increased nociceptive sensations but not cold sensations; when the skin was cooled during dynamic contact, cold sensations were again unchanged while nociceptive sensations were suppressed. A second experiment tested whether contact suppression of menthol's cold and nociceptive sensations at resting skin temperature was caused by slight deviations of thermode temperature above skin temperature. The results showed that suppression occurred even when the thermode was slightly cooler (-0.5 degrees C) than the skin. These findings support other evidence that the menthol-sensitive channel, TRPM8, plays a role in cold nociception, and raise new questions about how dynamic tactile stimulation may modify perception of nonpainful cold stimulation."
"Natural variations of maternal care in the rat influence the development of neuronal systems that regulate defensive responses to threat. Thus, as adults, rats that received higher levels of maternal licking/grooming (LG) in infancy display dramatic reductions in burying in the shock-probe test, relative to offspring of low LG mothers. We sought to replicate that finding and determine whether maternal care similarly influences offspring responses to social threat, using the resident-intruder test. We also examined whether maternal LG influences offspring behaviour along a continuum by comparing defensive responses of offspring of mid LG mothers to those of offspring of high LG and low LG mothers. A final goal was to assess whether the reductions in adult offspring reactivity to threat that typically follow corticosterone (CORT) administration to dams across lactation are mediated through CORT-induced changes in maternal care. Adult offspring of high LG mothers spent less time burying the shock-probe, relative to offspring of mid and low LG mothers, whereas offspring of CORT-treated mothers did not differ from any group. Similarly, offspring of high LG (but not CORT-treated) mothers displayed fewer defensive responses in the resident-intruder test. Thus, only natural variations of maternal care were associated with individual differences in offspring reactivity to threat. Furthermore, because offspring of mid and low LG mothers displayed equivalent levels of defensive responding in both tests, it appears that a critical threshold of maternal LG is necessary to alter the developmental trajectory of neural systems mediating defensive behaviours."
"Three experiments examined the effects of drug-extinction when a drug state served as a conditional stimulus (CS) for sucrose delivery or as a positive feature for pairings between a discrete CS (e.g., 15-s light-on) and sucrose. Some conditioning models predict that drug state will facilitate the conditional response (CR) based on an association with sucrose whether the drug is trained as a CS or as a facilitator. If so, repeated presentation of the drug state alone (drug-extinction) should decrease the CR in both situations. Nicotine (0.4mg/kg), amphetamine (AMP, 1mg/kg), and chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 5mg/kg) facilitated a goal tracking conditioned response to the discrete CS; however, AMP and CDP did not evoke reliable responding without an interposed stimulus, suggesting that associations between these drug states and sucrose are not expressed as anticipatory food seeking (goal tracking). Repeated presentation of each drug state alone did not disrupt facilitation by nicotine, amphetamine, or CDP; suggesting that the drug states did not facilitate goal tracking based on a direct association with sucrose. This latter finding implicates a higher-order or non-associative mechanism for facilitation of anticipatory food seeking by drug states in this Pavlovian discrimination task."
"Modafinil (MOD) is a wakefulness-promoting drug that improves the alertness levels in narcolepsy; however, the molecular mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. We found that after a single icv injection of MOD (10 microg/5 microl) the extracellular levels of dopamine (DA) and l-DOPA collected from the nucleus accumbens were increased and decreased, respectively. Separately, the icv administration of MOD (10 microg/5 microl) to rats enhanced wakefulness (W) whereas diminished sleep during 4h. Lastly, the alertness induced by MOD was partially antagonized by the sleep-inducing endocannabinoid anandamide (ANA). We conclude that MOD enhances the extracellular levels of DA, promotes W and its effects on sleep are partially blocked by ANA."
"Anxiety was assessed in rats treated with 5mg/kg of PCP bid for 7 days. One week after withdrawal, measures were collected in the light/dark apparatus and during exposure to a cat odor. PCP decreased time spent in the lit area and number of contacts with a cat collar. PCP thus amplified rats' fear of unprotected environments and predatory threats, which seems compatible with the distorted emotional experience in human schizophrenia."
Physical activity may have the potential to improve cognitive function. Here we show that forced treadmill-running results in selective improvements in hippocampal plasticity. Rats that underwent exercise training demonstrated enhanced expression of long-term potentiation in dentate gyrus and enhanced object recognition learning. Spatial learning in the Morris watermaze was unaffected by exercise. These changes were associated with an increase in expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the dentate gyrus.
"Harnessed bees conditioned to associate odors and sucrose reward learn to discriminate between olfactory mixtures and their odor components in negative (NP: A+, B+, AB-) and positive (PP: A-, B-, AB+) patterning experiments. They thus extend the proboscis to the reinforced (CS+) but not to the non-reinforced (CS-) stimuli. Using the same protocol, we studied whether or not trials, which are spaced in time, are more effective in supporting patterning discrimination than massed trials which succeed fast to each other ('trial-spacing effect'). Training followed a NP (4 A+, 4 B+, 8 AB-) or a PP (4 A-, 4 B-, 8 AB+) schedule, with a 1:1 ratio between CS+ and CS- trials (8 CS+ and 8 CS- trials). ITIs of 1, 3, 5 and 8min were used in both tasks. Increasing ITI resulted in better differentiation between reinforced and non-reinforced CSs in both NP and PP tasks. However, whereas only the longest ITI of 8min allowed discrimination in NP, PP could already be solved with an ITI of 5min. This difference might be due to the fact that NP, but not PP, would require the formation of a unique cue and thus longer processing times. We thus show that the trial-spacing effect, previously demonstrated for single stimulus conditioning, also determines performance in patterning tasks in which three different stimuli (A, B, AB) alternate so that elements have to be discriminated from their compound."
"Prolonged maternal deprivation leads to long-term alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, disturbances of auditory information processing and neurochemical changes in the adult brain, some of which are similar to that observed in schizophrenia. Here we report the adult behavioural effects of maternal deprivation (12h on postnatal days 9 and 11) in Wistar rats on paradigms of auditory information processing (prepulse inhibition), sensitivity to dopamimetics (amphetamine-induced hyper-locomotion) and cognition (T-maze delayed alternation and Morris water-maze). In addition, we examined the long-lasting effect of chronic 21-day corticosterone treatment during the post-pubertal period (i.e., postnatal days 56-76) on each of these behavioural paradigms in maternally deprived and control rats. Behavioural testing commenced 2 weeks after the termination of corticosterone treatment. Maternal deprivation led to a significant reduction in PPI and impaired spatial learning ability in adulthood, but did not affect the behavioural response to amphetamine. Post-pubertal chronic corticosterone treatment did not have any major long-lasting effects on any of the behavioural measures in either maternally deprived or control rats. Our findings further support maternal deprivation as an animal model of specific aspects of schizophrenia."
"Using a conditioned place paradigm, we examined the involvement of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) in the negative affective component of visceral and somatic pain induced by intraperitoneal acetic acid and intraplantar formalin injections, respectively, in rats. Bilateral BST lesions suppressed both the acetic acid- and formalin-induced conditioned place aversion, suggesting the crucial role of the BST in the negative affective component of visceral and somatic pain."
"Offspring of rats exposed to valproic acid (VPA) on gestational day (GD) 12 have been advocated as a rodent model of autism because they show neuron loss in brainstem nuclei and the cerebellum resembling that seen in human autistic cases . Studies of autistic children have reported alterations in acquisition of classical eyeblink conditioning and in reversal of instrumental discrimination learning . Acquisition of discriminative eyeblink conditioning depends on known brainstem-cerebellar circuitry whereas reversal depends on interactions of this circuitry with the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. In order to explore behavioral parallels of the VPA rodent model with human autism, the present study exposed pregnant Long-Evans rats to 600 mg/kg VPA on GD12 and tested their offspring from Postnatal Day (PND26-31) on discriminative eyeblink conditioning and reversal. VPA rats showed faster eyeblink conditioning, consistent with studies in autistic children . This suggests that previously reported parallels between human autism and the VPA rodent model with respect to injury to brainstem-cerebellar circuitry are accompanied by behavioral parallels when a conditioning task engaging this circuitry is used. VPA rats also showed impaired reversal learning, but this likely reflected ""carry-over"" of enhanced conditioning during acquisition rather than a reversal learning deficit like that seen in human autism. Further studies of eyeblink conditioning in human autism and in various animal models may help to identify the etiology of this developmental disorder."
"In songbirds, song learning and production are regulated by the song control system. How the rest of the brain interacts with song nuclei to ensure that song is produced in an appropriate context is not yet clear. In male European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), breeding context song is sexually motivated, whereas, non-breeding context song is more broadly socially motivated. Brain regions involved in regulating social behavior might differentially regulate starling song depending upon the context in which it is produced. Here, we compared the number of ZENK-labeled cells in song and social behavior nuclei in starlings singing in either a breeding or a non-breeding context. Numbers of ZENK-labeled cells in HVC related positively to song produced in both contexts. Interestingly, numbers of ZENK-labeled cells in one subdivision of the lateral septum (LS) related negatively to breeding context song but positively to non-breeding context song. In a subdivision of the medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTm) ZENK labeling only related positively to non-breeding context song, whereas, in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) ZENK labeling showed a tighter positive relationship with breeding context song. Together, these findings indicate that social behavior brain regions outside of the song control system regulate singing behavior differently depending upon whether song is sexually or more broadly socially motivated. Breeding context-dependent regulation of song by LS, BSTm, and VMH suggests that these nuclei may be central to adjusting song production so that it occurs in response to appropriate social and environmental stimuli."
"The human apolipoprotein E isoforms, apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4, have differential effects on brain function. Compared to apoE3, apoE4 increases the risk of age-related cognitive decline in humans and female mice expressing apoE in neurons. Here, we show impaired spatial memory retention in female mice expressing apoE4 in astrocytes compared to those expressing apoE3 in astrocytes or lacking apoE. Thus, apoE4 impairs cognition whether expressed in neurons or astrocytes."
"Repeated exposure to anabolic/androgenic steroids (AAS) during adolescence stimulates high levels of offensive aggression in Syrian hamsters. The current study investigated whether adolescent AAS exposure activated neurons in areas of hamster forebrain implicated in aggressive behavior by examining the expression of FOS, i.e., the protein product of the immediate early gene c-fos shown to be a reliably sensitive marker of neuronal activation. Adolescent AAS-treated hamsters and sesame oil-treated littermates were scored for offensive aggression and then sacrificed 1 day later and examined for the number of FOS immunoreactive (FOS-ir) cells in regions of the hamster forebrain important for aggression control. When compared with non-aggressive, oil-treated controls, aggressive AAS-treated hamsters showed persistent increases in the number of FOS-ir cells in select aggression regions, namely the anterior hypothalamus and lateral septum. However, no differences in FOS-ir cells were found in other areas implicated in aggression such as the ventrolateral hypothalamus, bed nucleus of the stria terminals, central and/or medial amygdala or in non-aggression areas, such as the samatosensory cortex and the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These results suggest that adolescent AAS exposure may constitutively activate neurons in select forebrain areas critical for the regulation of aggression in hamsters. A model for how persistent activation of neurons in one of these brain regions (i.e., the anterior hypothalamus) may facilitate the development of the aggressive phenotype in adolescent-AAS exposed animals is presented."
"Past research has shown that when rats received 0.4mg base/kg nicotine paired reliably with intermittent sucrose delivery that anticipatory sucrose-seeking behavior (i.e., goal tracking) was differentially displayed in the nicotine state relative to intermixed saline sessions in which no sucrose was delivered. The present research extended this observation to a lower dose of nicotine (i.e., 0.2mg base/kg) and tested a state-dependent learning account of differential conditioned responding. According to this account, the increase in goal tracking on nicotine sessions reflects a chamber-sucrose association that is only recalled when in the nicotine state. We used a 2x2 factorial design in which rats received sucrose deliveries in one drug state (nicotine or saline) and were then tested in the same state (Nic--&gt;Nic or Sal--&gt;Sal) or a different state (Nic--&gt;Sal or Sal--&gt;Nic) after acquiring the conditioned response. A state-dependency account predicts disruption in conditioned goal tracking for rats that receive a shift in drug state on the test day. This disruption did not occur suggesting that differential control of conditioned responding by nicotine is more likely due to a direct excitatory association between the interoceptive cueing effects of nicotine and the appetitive qualities of sucrose."
"Studies on heterozygous (HZ) reeler mice suggest a relationship between reelin (a protein of extra cellular matrix) haploinsufficiency and the presence of altered neural networks and behaviour. Neonatal adverse and/or stimulating experiences might interfere with the emergence of this genetic-dependent phenotype. Repeated episodes of maternal separation early in ontogeny result in enduring neuroendocrine, neurochemical and behavioural alterations in the offspring. Therefore, in order to investigate whether developmental indexes of neurobehavioural disorders can be studied in the infant reeler mouse model, and whether ontogenetic adverse experiences may question or improve its suitability, homozygous reeler (RL), heterozygous (HZ) and wild-type (WT) mouse pups underwent maternal separation (SEP, 5h/day) or handling (H, 3min/day) on PND 2-6. As expected, a sex difference appeared, for measure of emotional and communicative behaviour in infant mice. On PND 7, compared to other genotypes, RL mouse pups from the H control group, showed reduced levels of ultrasound (USV) production and of locomotion. Surprisingly, this deficit in RL mice was fully reverted by maternal separation. Maternal separation per se reduced social motivation in the homing test at PND 9 in WT mice, with no effects on HZ and RL ones. Additionally, female pups emitted much lower levels of ultrasound production than males within the H control group. Such a baseline sex difference, however, disappeared in the SEP group. The present results provide evidence that unusual stress and related hormonal stimulation early in development may (i) independently shape individual phenotype and (ii) interact with a genetic make-up to substantially modify its ""natural"" developmental trajectories."
"Thyroid hormone insufficiency leads to impaired neurogenesis, behavioral alterations and cognitive deficits. Thyroid hormone receptors, expressed in brain regions involved in these behaviors, mediate the effects of thyroid hormone deficiency or excess. To determine the contribution of thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TRalpha) in these behaviors, we examined the behavior of euthyroid as well as hypo- and hyperthyroid mice lacking all isoforms of the TRalpha (TRalpha(o/o)). The hypothyroxinemic TRalpha(o/o) mice demonstrated behavioral inhibition, manifested in decreased activity and increased anxiety/fear in the open field test (OFT) and increased immobility in the forced swim test (FST) compared to C57BL/6J mice. TRalpha(o/o) mice also showed learning and recall impairments in the Morris water maze (MWM), which were exaggerated by hypothyroidism in TRalpha(o/o) mice. These impairments were concurrent with increased thigmotaxis, suggesting an increased anxiety-like state of the TRalpha(o/o) mice in the MWM. Expression of genes, known to be involved in processes modulating learning and memory, such as glucocorticoid receptor (GR), growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) and neurogranin (RC3), were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of TRalpha(o/o) mice. GR expression was also decreased in the frontal cortex and amygdala of TRalpha(o/o) mice, indicating that expression of GR is regulated, probably developmentally, by one or more isoforms of TRalpha in the mouse brain. Taken together these data demonstrate behavioral alterations in the TRalpha(o/o) mice, indicating the functional role of TRalpha, and a delicate interaction between TRalpha and TRbeta-regulated genes in these behaviors. Thyroid hormone-regulated genes potentially responsible for the learning deficit found in TRalpha(o/o) mice include GR, RC3 and GAP-43."
"The inferior colliculus (IC) is involved in processing of auditory information, but also integrates acoustic information of aversive nature. In fact, chemical stimulation of the IC with semicarbazide (SMC) - an inhibitor of the GABA synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase - has been found to cause defensive behavior in an open-field test and functions as an unconditioned stimulus in the place conditioned aversion test (PCA). A question has arisen regarding whether the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) is involved in the acquisition of the aversive information ascending from the IC and whether dopaminergic and serotoninergic mechanisms of the BLA regulate this process. Recent evidence has shown that inactivation of the BLA with muscimol inhibits the PCA and causes an increase in the aversiveness of the chemical stimulation of the IC. Based on this, we examined the effects of ketanserin and SCH-23390, antagonists of the 5HT(2) and D(1) receptors, respectively, on the conditioned and unconditioned fear elicited by IC stimulation with SMC. The results obtained confirm the crucial role of 5-HT(2)- and D(1)-mechanisms of the BLA on conditioned fear in that ketanserin and SCH-23390 injections into the BLA caused a reduction in the PCA. On the other hand, ketanserin and SCH-23390 injections into the BLA enhanced the aversiveness of the IC injections of SMC. These findings suggest that while 5-HT(2) and DA(1) mechanisms in the BLA appear to facilitate the conditioned fear they inhibit the unconditioned fear triggered by IC activation."
"Stress can transiently increase motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), but it is unclear whether other behavioural changes associated with PD are also affected. We found that reaching-grasping was impaired in 19 PD patients compared with 19 matched controls, but these impairments were not amplified by stress. However, patients showed a stress-induced reduction of hedonic responses. Stress may amplify those impairments in PD that are not accessible to cognitive control."
"Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) is used as a front-line treatment for cancer and other diseases. Reports of depression as a consequence of IFN-alpha therapy scatter the literature, generating interest in the CNS disruptions elicited by this cytokine. In the present work, we investigated the short- and long-term effects of a single systemic injection of vehicle, 10, or 1000 units of IFN-alpha on temperature, body weight, food intake, sickness behaviours, locomotor activity, and brain stimulation reward (BSR) thresholds elicited from the ventral tegmental area in female Long-Evans rats. Pioneered for studying motivational processes, BSR has been exploited as a tool for tracking hedonic status in animal models of depression. In this study, the main findings were that IFN-alpha did not induce anhedonia as defined by no increase in frequency thresholds. However, the analyses of sickness behaviours unveiled a significant increase in piloerection in all sham control animals that received an IFN-alpha injection while the BSR animal scores remained relatively unchanged between pre- and post-injection days. This pattern was also evident in the overall total sickness behaviour scores. Our data suggest that a single exposure to IFN-alpha treatment in female rats elicits long-term somatic effects, without altering hedonic status."
"During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), subjects saw cues signaling probabilities of 1.0, 0.5, and 0 of winning $1 for hitting a subsequent target, and cues signaling similar probabilities of reward delivery requiring no instrumental response. Non-instrumental reward anticipation did not elicit activation. Instrumental reward anticipation activated multiple nodes of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor circuit. Ventromesial striatum was activated by joint requirement for an instrumental response together with uncertain (but not certain) reward."
"The development of motor skills was studied at different stages in the life of the mouse, focusing on three key aspects of motor development: early rhythmic motor activities prior to the acquisition of quadruped locomotion, motor skills in young adults, and the effect of aging on motor skills. The age-related development pattern was analysed and compared in two strains of major importance for genomic studies (C57Bl6/j and 129/sv). Early rhythmic air-stepping activities by l-dopa injected mice showed similar overall development in both strains; differences were observed with greater beating frequency and less inter-limb coordination in 129/sv, suggesting that 129/sv had a different maturation process. Performance on the rotarod by young adult C57Bl6/j gradually improved between 1 and 3 months, but then declined with age; performance on the treadmill also declined with an age-related increase in fatigability. Overall performance by 129/sv mice was lower than C57Bl6/j, and the age-related pattern of change was different, with 129/sv having relatively stable performance over time. Inter-strain differences and their possible causes, in particular the role of dopaminergic pathways, are discussed together with repercussions affecting mutant phenotyping procedures."
"Chicks searching for food grains against a background of unfamiliar pebbles usually peck pebbles less when using the right eye (RE), or both eyes, than when using the left eye (LE), provided that the embryo's RE has been exposed to light (Li), as is normal. When pecking is fast this right/left difference is mainly due to a heightened ability of RE chicks to inhibit premature pecks (and inappropriate responses in general). Dark incubation (Da) abolishes this ability in RE chicks, and RE and LE chicks show similar frequent pebble pecks. We show now that, under conditions that cause cautious pecking, both Li and Da chicks show a new effect: in both cases LE chicks peck pebbles more than RE chicks, probably because of the novelty of pebbles. Interest in novelty in LE chicks is known to be unaffected by light in incubation. Age-dependent effects are also important. RE and LE chicks, which had either the LE or RE exposed to light before hatching, were tested on days 3, 5, 8 or 12 post-hatching, under conditions giving normal fast pecking. Artificial exposure of the embryo's LE to light reversed the lateralization: in general, chicks using the light-exposed eye performed well at all ages. Irrespective of which eye system had heightened ability to inhibit pebble pecks, RE performance differed from usual on 2 days, whereas LE chicks showed no age-dependent changes. Changes confined to the RE system, therefore, affect behaviour independently of lateralization of the ability to inhibit inappropriate response."
"The activity of single units in the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus was recorded while rats performed an operant conditioning task. On all trials, each animal pressed a bar and then inserted his snout into a food cup; on half of the trials, food reinforcement was available. To test for tactile sensitivity, on half of the trials the rats received a puff of air to the face when the snout entered the food cup. Activity of most cells was correlated with the motor activity of inserting the snout into the food cup, even when reinforcement was not available. For many cells, a larger burst of activity was seen on the reinforced trials than on trials when rats made the same movements without the presence of reward. There was no evidence that an increase in tactile sensitivity occurred when the animal retrieved the reinforcement. These results suggest that cells in the superior colliculus have an increase in activity associated with reward retrieval, which for some neurons is not dependent on simple sensory or motor factors."
"F1 and F2 mouse hybrids derived from different parental strains are becoming a useful tool in behavioral research, underlining the importance of their in-depth behavioral phenotyping. 129S1/SvImJ (S1), C57BL/6 (B6), NMRI (N) and BALB/c (BC) mice are commonly used in behavioral neuroscience, demonstrating marked behavioral differences. Here, we assess behavioral phenotypes of male mice of S1 and several hybrid strains (S1B6, S1N, S1BC) in a battery of behavioral tests, including the open field, novel odor exposure, novelty-induced grooming, horizontal rod (Suok) and the elevated plus maze tests. In addition, we assessed aggression and social barbering in these strains. Overall, the substantial differences observed here between these strains allow us to determine the influence of different genetic backgrounds on mouse behaviors, and more fully understand how different strain-specific behaviors overlap in the F1 progeny. Our results imply complex interplay between parental genotypes in anxiety, activity, grooming, aggression and barbering of their F1 progeny, further confirming the utility of F1 hybrids in behavioral neurogenetics."
"The neural mechanisms mediating prepulse inhibition (PPI) appear to have relevance to neurological and psychiatric disorders. Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy exhibit psychotic symptoms and disrupted PPI, therefore the present experiments examined the consequences of seizures induced by kindling on PPI. Rats were chronically implanted with an electrode into the basolateral amygdala, perirhinal cortex, or ventral hippocampus and stimulated twice daily until 3 fully generalized, class 5 seizures were elicited. Kindling of basolateral amygdala, but not perirhinal cortex or ventral hippocampus, disrupted PPI when testing began 2min, but not 48h, following the elicitation of the third class 5 seizure. Startle amplitudes were unaffected by kindling. These results suggest that the anatomical origin of seizures is an important factor in determining their potentially disruptive effects on PPI."
"Spatial learning abilities of rodents have been extensively used to explore the management of a wide range of cognitive and emotional processes such as learning, memory, attention and anxiety. Knowledge about the organization and processing of spatial learning has mainly been obtained in rats. Due to increasing generation of genetically modified mice, cognitive abilities of mice are now extensively tested. The present paper aimed at comparing spatial representation, learning and strategies in C57BL/6J mice and Long-Evans Hooded rats when subjected to the same spatial learning paradigm, i.e. learning a food location in a crossmaze. We also analyzed the influence of environmental richness on learning modalities in both species. Our results showed that rats and mice could exhibit similar spatial learning abilities in some circumstances. However, Long-Evans rats and C57BL/6J mice may set up different strategies depending on the availability of visual information within the environment. Rats' learning strategies mainly relied on distant visual cues and seemed more efficient than those used by mice as they needed less time than mice to solve the task. We emphasize that the strategies of mice are less robust and flexible than the ones set up by rats. Finally, the richness of the environment was shown to affect speed and quality of spatial learning in both species."
"The cortical system underlying perceptual ability to localize tactile and noxious cutaneous stimuli in humans is still incompletely understood. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to transiently interfere with the function of the parietal cortex, at different times after the beginning of noxious or non-noxious mechanical stimulation of the hairy skin overlying the dorsal surface of the first metacarpal of the contralateral hand. Peripheral stimuli consisted of rounded (1mm diameter) or sharp (0.2 mm) metal tips; skin contact lasted on average 242 ms (noxious) and 228 ms (non-noxious). Brief (80 ms, 25 Hz) TMS trains, given at 150 ms after the onset of cutaneous stimulation, significantly impaired subjects' ability in localizing non-nociceptive, tactile input, an effect which was not observed when TMS was applied at 300 ms after cutaneous stimulation. In contrast, brief TMS trains given at 300 ms after the onset of cutaneous stimulation significantly impaired subjects' ability in localizing nociceptive input, an effect which was not observed when TMS was applied at 150 ms after cutaneous stimulation. No impairment in stimulus detection was found in comparison with control sham TMS. The timing of parietal TMS interference with the ability to localize tactile and painful stimuli is compatible with known time differences in the arrival of non-noxious and noxious information in the postcentral gyrus. On these grounds, our findings support the existence of overlapping cortical populations in the contralateral parietal lobe, exerting a role in spatial discriminative aspects of touch and mechanically induced pain."
"It has been suggested that the parasite Toxoplasma gondii reduces the fear of rodents toward their feline predators, which may lead to an augmented rate of predation and multiplication of the parasite through an increased number of life cycles. To investigate whether T. gondii infection induces selective effects on behavior associated with anxiety, Wistar rats were inoculated i.p. with several doses of T. gondii tachyzoites and tested in two animal tests of anxiety. In the third week following inoculation, rats infected with 100 and 1000 tachyzoites increased plus-maze open arm exploration in a dose-related manner. However, no effect was detected in either social interaction levels or motor activity measures. In the seventh week after inoculation, rats infected with 100 and 1000 tachyzoites showed increased open arm exploration and social investigation without change on any motor activity measures. However, rats infected with a higher dose (1500 tachyzoites) showed a drop in locomotion. These data support the hypothesis that T. gondii impairs mechanism of warning as a function of reduced anxiety. The pattern of brain colonization by the parasite and the host immune response suggests that the predominant invasion to limbic areas works as a natural anxiolytic mechanism."
"Reactive oxygen species are implicated in neurodegeneration and cognitive disorders due to higher vulnerability of neuronal tissues. The cerebellum is recently reported to be involved in cognitive function. Therefore, present study aimed at investigating the role alpha-lipoic acid against radiation-induced oxidative stress and antioxidant status in cerebellum and its correlation with cognitive dysfunction. We observed spontaneous motor activities and spatial memory task of mice using pyroelectric infrared sensor and programmed video tracking system, respectively. Whole body X-irradiation (6 Gy) of mice substantially impaired the reference memory and motor activities of mice. However, acute intraperitoneal treatment of mice with alpha-lipoic acid prior to irradiation significantly attenuated such cognitive dysfunction. Alpha-lipoic acid pretreatment exerted a very high magnitude of protection against radiation-induced augmentation of protein carbonyls and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) in mice cerebellum. Further, radiation-induced deficit of total, nonprotein and protein-bound sulfhydryl (T-SH, NP-SH, PB-SH) contents of cerebellum and plasma ferric reducing power (FRAP) was also inhibited by alpha-lipoic acid pre-treatment. Moreover, alpha-lipoic acid treated mice showed an intact cytoarchitecture of cerebellum, higher counts of intact Purkinje cells and granular cells in comparison to untreated irradiated mice. Results clearly indicate that alpha-lipoic acid is potent neuroprotective antioxidant."
"Conditioned fear associates a contextual environment and cue stimulus to a foot shock in a single training trial, where fear expressed to the trained context or cue indicates cognitive performance. Lesion, aspiration or inactivation of the hippocampus and amygdala impair conditioned fear to the trained context and cue, respectively. Moreover, only bilateral experimental manipulations, in contrast to unilateral, abolish cognitive performance. In a model of unilateral brain injury, we sought to test whether a single lateral fluid percussion brain injury impairs cognitive performance in conditioned fear. Brain-injured mice were evaluated for anterograde cognitive deficits, with the hypothesis that acute injury-induced impairments improve over time. Male C57BL/6J mice were brain-injured, trained at 5 or 27 days post-injury, and tested 48h later for recall of the association between the conditioned stimuli (trained context or cue) and the unconditioned stimulus (foot shock) by quantifying fear-associated freezing behavior. A significant anterograde hippocampal-dependent cognitive deficit was observed at 7 days in brain-injured compared to sham. Cued fear conditioning could not detect amygdala-dependent cognitive deficits after injury and stereological estimation of amygdala neuron number corroborated this finding. The absence of injury-related freezing in a novel context substantiated injury-induced hippocampal-dependent cognitive dysfunction, rather than generalized fear. Variations in the training and testing paradigms demonstrated a cognitive deficit in consolidation, rather than acquisition or recall. By 1-month post-injury, cognitive function recovered in brain-injured mice. Hence, the acute injury-induced cognitive impairment may persist while transient pathophysiological sequelae are underway, and improve as global dysfunction subsides."
"The objective of the present study was to investigate the contribution of adrenal stress hormones to strain differences in cocaine sensitivity. For this purpose, we have studied sensitisation to the locomotor stimulant effect of cocaine and, in parallel, cocaine-induced corticosterone secretion in two inbred mouse strains: C57BL/6 and DBA/2. Adrenalectomy ('ADX': surgical removal of the adrenal glands) was performed in a subset of animals to investigate the contribution of the adrenals. ADX and SHAM operated mice were subjected to repeated injections of cocaine (15.0mg/kg) or saline for nine consecutive days, followed by a 5-day withdrawal interval and a saline challenge on day 14. All animals were challenged with 7.5mg/kg cocaine on day 15. We report that repeated cocaine exposure induced locomotor sensitisation in both strains, while endocrine sensitisation was only observed in the DBA/2 strain. By contrast, cocaine attenuated corticosterone responses in C57BL/6 mice throughout the sensitisation paradigm. We have therefore identified one strain, the DBA/2 strain, that displays parallel sensitisation of cocaine-induced locomotion and -corticosterone secretion. Most interestingly, ADX prevented locomotor sensitisation only in DBA/2 mice, suggesting that behavioural sensitisation depends on the integrity of adrenal function and on secretion of adrenal glucocorticoids in this strain. The present results demonstrate that adrenal stress hormones facilitate behavioural sensitisation to cocaine in a genotype-dependent manner and suggest that glucocorticoids contribute to strain differences in psychostimulant sensitivity."
"We have previously reported that in rats given the choice between operant and free access to water (contrafreeloading: CFL), repeated administrations of quinpirole, a D2/D3 dopamine receptor agonist, shifted the animals towards the operant access and inhibited water intake. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of substituting different concentrations of ethanol (2, 4, 6%) for water on the effects of repeated daily administrations of vehicle or quinpirole (0.5mg/kg i.p.) in rats that for 6 days were given access to the fluid according to an FR3 schedule of reinforcement and for the following 9 days were given the choice between operant and free access to the fluid. On the first day quinpirole completely suppressed operant behavior, which however progressively increased in the subsequent sessions, approaching control levels by day 6. Ethanol presentation did not alter these effects of quinpirole. When the resource was also freely available, quinpirole produced the expected shift from free to operant access to water (CFL). Substituting ethanol for water resulted in a concentration-related reduction of the over-responding and, consequently, of CFL induced by quinpirole. In vehicle-injected subjects ethanol did not affect responding and only marginally reduced fluid intake. Thus, ethanol appears to prevent perseveration in performing needless instrumental behavior induced by repeated activation of D2/D3 receptors."
"The sensitivity of prenatally malnourished rats to the ultrasonic vocalization (USV) suppressant effect of diazepam (a non-specific benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor agonist) was investigated. Male offspring of dams provided with a protein deficient diet (6% casein) for 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy were compared to the offspring of mothers provided with a diet of adequate protein content (25% casein). At postnatal day 7 or 11, pups were injected with vehicle or one of five doses of DZ (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1 or 3mg/kg) 30 min after removal from their dam. Thirty minutes later they were subjected to 2 min of cooling on a 20 degrees C surface and their USVs were quantified. DZ dose-dependently suppressed USV at both ages. At P7, the USV suppressant effect of DZ was the same for both groups. However, by P11 the prenatally malnourished rats showed significantly greater suppression of USV by 0.03 and 0.1mg/kg DZ than well-nourished controls. These differences were not related to degree of temperature loss or body weight. Thus, differential sensitivity to BZ receptor agonists develops in the second postnatal week in prenatally malnourished rats. This reflects either an altered program of development of the GABAergic system, or adaptive, compensatory changes in the GABAergic system in response to more extensive functional disturbances in the developing brain."
"Domestic chicks were tested for eye use while feeding on the floor in the presence of a dummy mask which could either look at the location where the chicks were feeding or in the opposite direction. Animals completely na&#xef;ve of visual experience of human eyes and gaze showed a more intense fear response when directly looked at (as shown by higher latency to approach the food) and a preferential use of the left eye (mainly feeding structures in their right hemisphere) to monitor the dummy mask. This response, seemingly predisposed, could be reversed in chicks with experience of human eyes and gaze directed toward them, which showed higher latency to approach the food and preferential left eye use when the dummy mask looked away from them. The results are discussed in relation to evidence for a right hemisphere involvement in fear responses and detection of predators in the vertebrate brain."
"Previous study has indicated that chronic treatment with lithium protects brain against ischemic injury by reducing apoptotic death. To investigate whether lithium improves the behavioral disorder induced by transient global cerebral ischemia, we examined the effects of lithium treatment on the performance of rats in a set of behavioral tests, i.e. beam balance, elevated plus maze (EPM), open field and Morris water maze. Our results showed that lithium attenuated the worse general 'well-being' and the worse performance in beam balance, and hyperactivity in EPM and open field, including increased open arm entries, time spent in the open arms, squares crossed, rearing and grooming over 7 days after 15min ischemia, which were induced by four-vessel occlusion in Sprague-Dawley rats. Moreover, lithium improved the injured spatial learning and memory ability in Morris water maze at post-ischemic days 8 and 9. Histological analysis displayed that it decreased obviously cell death in hippocampal CA1 region. Our study further confirmed the protective role of lithium in the ischemia-reperfusion injury and suggested that lithium might be a helpful therapeutic approach to the treatment of stroke combining with other neuroprotective agents."
"Behaviour in novel environments is influenced by the conflicting motivators fear and curiosity. Because changes in both of these motivational processes are often simultaneously involved in human affective disorders, we have developed the exploration box test which allows separation of animals belonging to clusters with inherent high neophobia/low motivation to explore and low neophobia/high motivation to explore (LE and HE, respectively). In a novel home-cage, no behavioural differences were found between LE- and HE-rats, suggestive that it is not the general locomotor activity but specific features of the exploration box test that bring about the differences. In studies on both Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats we found that the trait of exploratory activity remains stable over long periods of time and that LE and HE animals display differences in many other behavioural tests related to mood disorders. Namely, LE animals were found to display enhanced anxiety-like behaviour and to be generally less active in the elevated plus-maze, used more passive coping strategies in the forced swimming test, and acquired a more persistent association between neutral and stressful stimuli in fear conditioning test. LE animals consumed more sucrose solution in non-deprived conditions. We also found that both at baseline and in response to d-amphetamine (0.5mg/kg) administration, LE-rats had lower extracellular dopamine levels in striatum but not in nucleus accumbens. In conclusion, LE-rats appear more inhibited in their activity in typical animal tests of anxiety and are more susceptible to acute stressful stimuli."
"The relationship between neuronal function in the brain and neuropsychological behavior were analyzed in young rats fed a zinc-deficient diet for 1-2 weeks. Serum zinc concentration was less than 50% of that of the control. However, zinc concentration in the hippocampal perfusate measured by the in vivo microdialysis was not decreased after 2-week zinc deprivation. Timm's stain, with which histochemically reactive zinc in the presynaptic vesicle is detected, was not also attenuated in the brain. On the other hand, serum corticosterone concentration, which was determined in the morning, was markedly increased after 2-week zinc deprivation and intracellular calcium signal, which was determined by fura-2 AM, was also increased in the hippocampus. In the hippocampus in zinc deficiency, intracellular free calcium concentration may be altered prior to the decrease in zinc concentration in the extracellular fluid. When rats were subjected to the open-field test, the frequency of line crossing and the time of grooming were decreased after 2-week zinc deprivation. In the plus-maze test, the time spent in the open arms was also decreased in zinc-deficient rats, suggesting that anxiety-like behavior is increased in zinc deficiency. The present study indicates that the increase in anxiety-like behavior in zinc deficiency may be linked to the increased concentration of basal free calcium in hippocampal cells, probably due to the increase in serum corticosterone concentration."
"The kampo (Japanese herbal) medicine ""kami-untan-to"" (KUT) has been used for a long time in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. We have recently reported that mice put on a thiamine-deficient (TD) diet exhibit a depressive behavior and impairment in avoidance learning after 20 days, and that this impairment was reversed by the chronic administration of KUT. In the present study, we investigated the effect of KUT on the depressive behavior observed in TD mice by using the forced swimming test. Our results show that oral administration of KUT from the 1st day of TD feeding prevented the increased duration of immobility in TD mice. Administration of KUT from the 10th day of TD feeding also had a beneficial effect on depressive behavior. To examine the relationship between the potential effects of KUT on monoaminergic neuronal functions and the depressive behavior observed in TD mice, we measured the immunohistochemical distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the brain using microphotometry. The fluorescence intensity of TH decreased in the limbic cortex and brainstem in TD mice compared with pair-fed mice as the control group, while KUT treatment protected against these decreases. These results suggest that KUT treatment may prevent a sign of depressive behavior, the animal immobility time, induced by TD feeding through a mechanism that involves the decrease of TH in some brain areas of TD mice."
"In humans, anxiety is accompanied by changes in autonomic nervous system function, including increased heart rate, body temperature, and blood pressure, and decreased heart rate variability. In rodents, anxiety is inferred by examining anxiety-related behavioral responses such as avoidance and freezing, and more infrequently by assessing autonomic responses to anxiogenic stimuli. However, few studies have simultaneously measured behavioral and autonomic responses to aversive stimuli in rodents and it remains unclear whether autonomic measures are reliable correlates of anxiety-related behavior in these animal models. Here we recorded for the first time heart rate and body temperature in freely moving BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice during exposure to an unfamiliar environment. Our data show that upon exposure to a novel open field, BALB/c mice showed increased anxiety-related behavior, reduced heart rate and higher heart rate variability (HRV) when compared with C57BL/6 mice. Regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between both heart rate and long-term HRV measures and locomotor activity and time spent in the center of the open field, but no correlation between body temperature and any behavioral variables. In the free exploration test, in which animals were allowed direct access to a novel environment from a familiar environment without experimenter handling, significant correlations were found only between heart rate and total locomotor activity, but not time spent in the unfamiliar chamber despite increased anxiety-related behavior in BALB/c mice. These findings demonstrate that increased anxiety-related behavior in BALB/c mice is not associated with specific changes in heart rate, HRV, or body temperature."
"An existing attentional-associative model of classical conditioning [Schmajuk N, Lam Y, Gray JA. Latent inhibition: a neural network approach. J Exp Psychol: Anim Behav Process 1996;22:321-49] is applied to the description of reinstatement in animals and humans. According to the model, inhibitory associations between the context (CX) and unconditioned stimulus (US) are formed during extinction, which help preserve the association between the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the US. However, summation and retardation tests fail to reveal these associations because (a) the CX is not attended or (b) a CX-CS configural stimulus formed during extinction is both poorly attended and weakly active during testing. When US presentations and testing occur in the same context, reinstatement is the consequence of a decreased CX inhibition and the increased attention to the CS, which activates the remaining CS-US association. When US presentations occur in the context of extinction but the CS is tested in a different context, reinstatement results from an increased attention to the CS and the combination of CS-CX and CX-US excitatory associations. The assumption that associations between CSs are impaired following neurotoxic hippocampal lesions or in amnesia, is sufficient to describe absence of reinstatement in those cases. However, additional assumptions might be needed to describe the effect of hippocampal lesions on other postextinction manipulations."
"This review is an attempt to localize the brain region responsible for pattern generation of species-specific vocalizations. A catalogue is set up, listing the criteria considered to be essential for a vocal pattern generator. According to this catalogue, a vocal pattern generator should show vocalization-correlated activity, starting before vocal onset and reflecting specific acoustic features of the vocalization. Artificial activation by electrical or glutamatergic stimulation should produce artificially sounding vocalization. Lesioning is expected to have an inhibitory or deteriorating effect on vocalization. Anatomically, a vocal pattern generator can be assumed to have direct or, at least, oligosynaptic connections with all the motoneuron pools involved in phonation. A survey of the literature reveals that the only area meeting all these criteria is a region, reaching from the parvocellular pontine reticular formation just above the superior olive through the lateral reticular formation around the facial nucleus and nucleus ambiguus down to the caudalmost medulla, including the dorsal and ventral reticular nuclei and nucleus retroambiguus. It is proposed that vocal pattern generation takes place within this whole region."
"Exposure to intermittent hypoxia (IH), such as occurs in sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), is associated with cognitive impairment, neurodegeneration, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses within rodent brain regions such as the basal forebrain. In this region, damage to cholinergic neurons correlates with working memory deficits in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, suggesting that degeneration of cholinergic systems may also contribute to the working memory impairments observed after IH exposures. We therefore examined basal forebrain choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) immunohistochemistry, nicotinic receptor binding in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and working memory, in male rats tested on a delayed matching to place (DMP) task in the water maze following exposure to either room air (RA) or intermittent hypoxia (IH; alternating 90s epochs of 21% and 10% O(2) during sleep). IH-treated animals displayed impaired working memory with respect to controls, along with significant reductions in CHAT-stained neurons in the medial septal nucleus, in both the vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band, and the substantia inominata after 14 days of IH exposure. In addition, increases in nicotinic binding and receptor affinity in the PFC were observed after 14 days of IH exposure. Thus, a loss of cholinergic neuronal phenotype in the basal forebrain may contribute to the cognitive impairments associated with CIH exposure. However, compensatory mechanisms may also be activated in other brain regions, and may provide potential therapeutic targets for the cognitive impairments associated with SDB."
"The cholinergic system plays a crucial role in learning and memory. Modulatory mechanisms of this system in the acquisition and consolidation processes have been extensively studied, but their participation in the memory retrieval process is still poorly understood. Conventional pharmacological agents are not highly selective for particular muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes. Muscarinic toxins (MTs) that are highly selective for muscarinic receptors were extracted from the venom of the mamba snake, like the toxin MT3, selective for the M4 receptor subtype. These toxins are useful tools in studies of the specific functions of the M4 mediated transmission. The M4 receptor selective antagonist MT3, given into the dorsal hippocampus before the test, have enhanced the memory retrieval of an inhibitory avoidance task in rats. MT3 had no effect in the habituation to a new environment, including basic motor parameters, meaning that the effect in he inhibitory avoidance is purely cognitive. Our results suggest an endogenous negative modulation of the cholinergic muscarinic system upon the retrieval of previously consolidated aversive memories, hereby shown by the facilitatory effect of MT3."
"Animal models of anxiety remain a useful tool for evaluating the anxiolytic-like effect of new treatments. Even though many tests are similarly based on exploration tasks, using more than one animal model is all the more recommended since there are qualitative differences between such tests. Furthermore, although many tests are excellent tool for detecting benzodiazepines/GABA compounds, inconsistent results have been reported for 5-HT ligands. Here, two animal models have been chosen, the elevated plus maze (EPM) based on the natural aversion of rodents for open spaces and the four-plates test (FPT) a models involving the animal's conditioned response to stressful events. In a recent study, we have demonstrated that the 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist DOI and the 5-HT(2B) agonist BW 723C86 were shown to produce an anxiolytic-like effect in both tests. This study aimed to evaluate a putative interaction between benzodiazepine and 5-HT(2) ligands in the FPT and the EPM. Indeed, close distribution of GABA(A) and 5-HT(2) receptors was found in brain structures leading to functional interrelation. In the FPT, sub-active doses of alprazolam and diazepam were strongly potentiated by DOI. BW 723C86, also potentiated the anxiolytic-like effect of the two benzodiazepines with a weaker effect. In the same way, DOI and benzodiazepines administration induced an increase in the anxiolytic-like parameters in the EPM with a strongest effect observed with alprazolam. Regardless of anxiety models used in this study, 5-HT(2A) ligands exerted facilitatory influence upon GABAergic system. Therefore, the FPT and the EPM might implicate the same kind of anxiety."
"It is essential to develop animal models to study the role of genetic factors in the relapse of drug-seeking behavior in genetically engineered mutant mice. This paper reports a typical model of drug-primed and cue-induced reinstatement of extinguished methamphetamine (METH)-seeking behavior in mice. C57BL/6J mice were trained to self-administer METH (0.1mg/kg/infusion) by poking their nose into an active hole under a fixed ratio schedule in daily 3-h sessions. After acquiring stable METH self-administration behavior, the mice were subjected to extinction training in the absence of both METH and METH-associated cues. Once the active nose-poking responses were extinguished, drug-primed and cue-induced reinstatement were investigated according to a within-subjects design. A priming injection of METH reliably reinstated the extinguished drug-seeking behavior in the absence of both METH and METH-associated cues. Interestingly, the drug-primed METH-seeking behavior disappeared within 2 months after withdrawal from METH, while cue-induced reinstatement of extinguished METH-seeking behavior lasted for at least 5 months after the withdrawal. A correlation study revealed that drug-primed, but not cue-induced, reinstatement behavior was positively correlated with the total amount of METH taken by individuals during METH self-administration. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the present reinstatement procedure for mouse model of relapse is useful and reliable, and different neural mechanisms may be involved in drug-primed and cue-induced METH-seeking behavior."
"Unilateral dopamine depletion in rats induced by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the nigrostriatal system causes permanent impairments in limb use. The disturbances in limb use, including impairments in skilled reaching, are most severe on the side contralateral to the lesion. A number of studies, however, have also described ipsilateral deficits in skilled reaching. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of sequential bilateral striatal 6-OHDA lesions on skilled reaching movements in rats to compare the contribution of contra- versus ipsilateral motor control. Rats were trained in a reaching task to grasp food pellets with their preferred paw prior to receiving an intrastriatal 6-OHDA injection on the side contralateral to the preferred paw. The lesion significantly reduced reaching success along with qualitative impairments in limb use. In addition, animals displayed asymmetry in limb use and contraversive rotation bias after an apomorphine challenge. Three weeks later, animals received a second lesion induced by intrastriatal 6-OHDA injection into the hemisphere ipsilateral to the preferred paw. This lesion exaggerated the previous impairments in limb use and further reduced reaching success of the preferred paw. In the ladder rung walking task, additional impairments were found only in the forelimb ipsilateral to the first lesion. The findings of additive effects of sequential bilateral lesions suggest that both the contra- and ipsilateral striatum control single limb use. This supports the notion of bilateral control of skilled forelimb use by the mesostriatal dopaminergic system."
"Interactions among reproductive season, testosterone (T) and female presence were investigated on the structure and function of forebrain and neuromuscular systems controlling courtship and copulation in the green anole lizard. Under breeding (BS) or non-breeding (NBS) environmental conditions, male green anoles were implanted with either T or blank capsules and exposed to one of three female stimulus conditions: physical, visual or no female contact. T and at least visual exposure to females increased courtship displays (extension of a throat fan, or dewlap), and these effects were greater during the BS than NBS. T also facilitated copulation, and did so to a greater extent in the BS. The hormone increased soma size in the preoptic area (POA) and amygdala (AMY), and in the AMY the effects were greater in the BS than NBS. Cross-sectional areas of copulatory organs and associated muscle fibers were enhanced by T, and more so in the BS than NBS. However, no effects on morphology of dewlap motoneurons or muscles or copulatory motoneurons were detected. Thus, (1) changes in behavior and neural and/or muscular morphology are not always parallel and (2) differences in responsiveness to T exist across seasons and among tissues."
"Deficient sensorimotor gating, measured as prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle, reflects disturbed information processing found in neuropsychiatric disorders. Examining the ability to selectively breed rats for high and low PPI, results showed significant differences of PPI scores within two generations. Comparing antipsychotics to restore PPI of the low group, haloperidol was shown more effective than clozapine. This suggests low PPI rats may be useful models for neuropsychiatric disorders and screening antipsychotics."
"Rats incorporate circa 22kHz ultrasonic alarm cries into their defense pattern in response to a predator threat. These calls are dependent on conspecific presence, show gender differences, and tend to be emitted from a place of relative safety. Rats emit sonic defensive threat vocalizations when approached by a potential threat. These are emitted regardless of conspecific presence, and increase as a function of threat proximity, eventually culminating in defensive attack at close distances. Ample data from field studies suggest a similar division of vocalizations into alarm or warning cries, and defensive threat vocalizations, although both are often subsumed under the rubric of ""alarm cries"". A clear distinction between these types of calls is necessary for proper analysis of the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the development and maintenance of each of them. Furthermore, the integration of data from field studies and laboratory experiments may prove useful in evaluation of the relationship between each type of cry and emotional (fear or anxiety-like) states in mammals."
"Presentation of negative pictures was used as emotional stress to assess gender differences in prefrontal area activation in a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) study. Compared with neutral condition, the response of oxy-HB for men yielded no significant difference during stress period, but the response induced by stress pictures for women showed significant enhancement. It was indicated that it is crucial to take gender difference into account when negative stimuli are used in functional brain imaging."
"We have investigated the effect of precociously increasing locomotor activity during early postnatal development by daily treatment with the monoaminergic precursor L-DOPA on the survival of motoneurones supplying the slow soleus (SOL) muscle and the fast, tibialis anterior (TA) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles as well as the contractile and histochemical properties of these muscles. L-DOPA treatment resulted in a significant loss of motoneurones to the slow SOL muscle, but not to the fast TA and EDL muscles. Moreover, motoneurones to fast muscles also die as when exposed to increased activity in early life, if their axons are repeatedly injured. The loss of normal soleus motoneurones was accompanied by an increase in force of the remaining motor units and sprouting of the surviving axons suggesting a remodelling of motor unit organisation. The time to peak contraction of both SOL and EDL muscles from L-DOPA treated rats was prolonged at 8 weeks of age. At 4 weeks the soleus muscles of the L-DOPA treated animal developed more tension than the saline treated one. This difference between the two groups did not persist and by 8 weeks of age the muscle weight and tetanic tension from either group were not significantly different from control animals. The present study shows that early transient, precocious locomotor activity induced by L-DOPA is damaging to normal soleus but not to normal EDL/TA motoneurones."
We have previously shown that electrolytic lesion-induced neurogenesis in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN) is significantly correlated with the recovery of courtship behavior in adult male ring doves. Here we revealed that reduction of lesion-induced neurogenesis in VMN impaired the behavioral recovery suggesting therefore a causal link between neurogenesis and behavioral recovery. Our results lend support that adult neurogenesis is latent in repair of injured brain.
"Locomotor impairments after spinal cord injury (SCI) are often assessed using open-field rating scales. These tasks have the advantage of spanning the range from complete paralysis to normal walking; however, they lack sensitivity at specific levels of recovery. Additionally, most supplemental assessments were developed in rats, not mice. For example, the horizontal ladder beam has been used to measure recovery in the rat after SCI. This parametric task results in a videotaped archival record of the event, is easily administered, and is unambiguously scored. Although a ladder beam apparatus for mice is available, its use in the assessment of recovery in SCI mice is rare, possibly because normative data for uninjured mice and the type of step misplacements injured mice exhibit is lacking. We report the development of a modified ladder beam instrument and scoring system to measure hindlimb recovery in vertebral T9 contusion spinal cord injured mice. The mouse ladder beam allows for the use of standard parametric statistical tests to assess locomotor recovery. Ladder beam performance is consistent across four strains of mice, there are no sex differences, and inter-rater reliability between observers is high. The ladder beam score is proportional to injury severity and can be used to easily separate mice capable of weight-supported stance up to mice with consistent forelimb to hindlimb coordination. Critically, horizontal ladder beam testing discriminates between mice that score identically in terms of stepping frequency in open-field testing."
"We performed five generations of artificial selection on laterality of eye preference in Girardinus falcatus using a detour test. Two lines were selected for right turning when encountering a potential predator, two for left turning, one for no turning bias and one unselected line was used as control. We observed a prompt response to directional selection in all lines and the response was approximately symmetrical in left and right turning lines. However, the response to selection ceased after the first or the second generation and unexpectedly in all lines the average laterality score slowly decreased in subsequent generations. After selection was suspended for three generations, no significant variation in mean laterality was observed in most cases, indicating that natural selection was not actively opposing artificial selection during the experiment. After five generations, selected lines maintained substantial additive variance as evidenced by the possibility of rapidly reversing the direction of laterality bias in just one generation of counter-selection."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by progressive cognitive impairment with neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anomalous motor behaviour, depression, anxiety, weight loss, irritability and agitation. The effect of hAPP and PS1 overexpression on cognition has been well characterised in a variety of transgenic mouse models, however, non-cognitive behaviours have not been considered as systematically. The non-cognitive behaviour of the hAPP/PS1 transgenic mouse model (TASTPM) was observed at ages spanning the rapid progression of amyloid neuropathology. TASTPM transgenic mice, of both genders, exhibited decreased spontaneous motor activity, disinhibition, increased frequency and duration of feeding bouts, reduced body weight and, by 10 months, increased activity over a 24h period. In addition to the aforementioned behaviours, male transgenic mice also displayed enhanced aggression relative to wildtype controls. These data reveal previously unreported disease relevant behavioural changes that demonstrate the value of measuring behaviour in APP/PS1 transgenic models. These behavioural readouts could be useful in screening putative drug treatments for AD."
"Nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP pathway is known as a mediator in anxiety modulation. In this study, we assessed the involvement of NO pathway in the estrous cycle-related changes of anxiety level in rat. By using elevated plus-maze test, we studied the changes of serum nitrate and nitrite (NO(x)) levels in comparison to the estrous cycle-dependent changes of anxiety state. Then, we tested the effects of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, L-NAME (10, 60mg/kg, i.p.), and the NO precursor, l-arginine (100mg/kg, i.p.) on anxiety modulatory properties of exogenous ovarian hormones in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Compared with other cycle phases and with OVX rats, cycling rats spent more time in open arms and had lower levels of serum NO(x) levels during metestrous while they spent less time in open arms and had lower levels of serum NO(x) levels during proestrous. In OVX rats, L-NAME (60mg/kg, i.p.) exerted anxiolytic effect while l-arginine showed no effect. In comparison with corn oil-treated controls, estradiol benzoate (10microg/kg, subcutaneously (s.c.)) significantly increased the serum NO(x) level and exerted anxiogenic effect, which was dose-dependently inhibited by L-NAME but was not changed by l-arginine. In contrast, progesterone (25mg/kg, s.c.) significantly decreased the serum NO(x) level and exerted anxiolytic effect, which was abolished by l-arginine but was not affected by L-NAME. These findings suggest that NO system might be involved in the estrous cycle-related changes of anxiety level, probably by mediating the effect of ovarian sex hormones."
"Dopaminergic neurotransmission is considered to modulate cognitive processes, including spatial memory. The aim of this study was to further evaluate the role of the D1 receptor system in an active allothetic place avoidance (AAPA) task using pretrained rats. Our previous results showed enhanced AAPA learning after systemic injections of low doses of D1 agonist A77636, and the impairment of AAPA acquisition by D1 blocker SCH23390 [Stuchlik A, Vales K. Effect of dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 and agonist A77636 on active allothetic place avoidance, a spatial cognition task. Behav Brain Res 2006;172(2):250-255]. In the present study, we used the intact-pretraining paradigm, in which animals were trained to the task prior to the injections and subsequently retrieval and reacquisition of AAPA while under the effects of the drugs was tested. Results showed that the intact pretraining partly eliminated the effects of A77636 and SCH23390 on AAPA performance, but a higher dose of SCH23390 caused a motor deficit in the retrieval session. We conclude that in the previous study, D1-active drugs may have had influence upon the non-spatial aspects of the AAPA."
"The syndrome of hemispatial neglect is defined as an inability to report, respond or orient to stimuli contralateral to a cerebral lesion despite intact elementary sensory or motor function. This syndrome is typically observed after lesions of the right cerebral cortex, and has been associated with impairment of attention. We studied whether visual attention performance is impaired after right-hemisphere infarction in rats. Using a behavioural paradigm measuring spatial visual attention, we tested the effects of photothrombotic infarction to either the frontal cortex or the parietal cortex on attention performance. Since the cholinergic system is known to modulate attention performance, we additionally evaluated the role of cholinergic receptor blockade with scopolamine in our task paradigm. Our results show a transient response bias immediately after cortical infarction, with a decrease in contralesional responses and an increase in contralesional omissions after frontal infarction. Parietal infarction and systemic administration of scopolamine also resulted in a decrease in correct responses and an increase in omissions, but without a difference in side responding. In conclusion, right frontal infarction induces a transient impairment in contralesional spatial visual attention that we explain as left-sided neglect. Right parietal infarction and cholinergic blockade shows non-lateralized deficits in spatial visual attention, suggestive of global attentional impairment. We postulate that both effects of cortical infarction on attention performance may be related to cholinergic dysfunction. Our study confirms the role of frontal and parietal cortices in attention performance in rats, and corroborates the theory that attention performance is impaired in hemispatial neglect in human stroke patients."
"Strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors are expressed in many adult forebrain regions, yet the biological function of these receptors outside the spinal cord/brainstem is poorly understood. We have recently shown that rat lateral/basolateral amygdala neurons express strychnine-sensitive glycine-gated currents whose pharmacological and molecular characteristics are consistent with those established for classic ligand-gated chloride channels. The current studies were undertaken to establish the behavioral role, if any, of these strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors. Adult Long-Evans male rats were implanted with guide cannulae targeted at the lateral amygdala and were microinjected with standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid with or without various doses of strychnine or taurine. Anxiety-like behaviors were assessed with the elevated plus maze or the light/dark box. In the elevated plus maze, strychnine decreased closed-arm time and increased open-arm time, suggestive of an anxiolytic effect. Similarly, strychnine produced a modest anxiolytic effect in the light/dark box. Post hoc analysis of 'open-arm' time and 'light-side' time indicated that aCSF-treated animals were distributed into two apparent groups that displayed either high or low amounts of anxiety-like behavior in a given apparatus. Surprisingly, the pharmacological effects of both strychnine and taurine in these assays were dependent upon a given animal's behavioral phenotype. Together, these findings are significant because they suggest that the basal 'emotional state' of the animal could influence the behavioral outcome associated with drug application directly into the lateral/basolateral amygdala. Furthermore, our findings also suggest that compounds acting at amygdala strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors may actively modulate this basal anxiety-like state."
"Serotonin (5-HT) can either increase or decrease anxiety-like behaviour in animals, actions that depend upon neuroanatomical site of action and 5-HT receptor subtype. Although systemic studies with 5-HT(2) receptor agonists and antagonists suggest a facilitatory role for this receptor subtype in anxiety, somewhat inconsistent results have been obtained when such compounds have been directly applied to limbic targets such as the hippocampus and amygdala. The present study investigated the effects of the 5-HT(2B/2C) receptor agonist mCPP bilaterally microinjected into the dorsal hippocampus (DH: 0, 0.3, 1.0 or 3.0nmol/0.2microl), the ventral hippocampus (VH: 0, 0.3, 1.0 or 3.0nmol/0.2microl) or the amygdaloid complex (0, 0.15, 0.5, 1.0 or 3.0nmol/0.1microl) in mice exposed to the elevated plus-maze (EPM). Test sessions were videotaped and subsequently scored for conventional indices of anxiety (percentage of open arm entries and percentage of open arm time) and locomotor activity (closed arm entries). Results showed that mCPP microinfusions into the DH or VH failed to affect any behavioural measure in the EPM. However, when injected into the amygdaloid complex, the dose of 1.0nmol of this 5HT(2B/2C) receptor agonist increased behavioural indices of anxiety without significantly altering general activity levels. This anxiogenic-like effect of mCPP was selectively and completely blocked by local injection of a behaviourally-inactive dose of SDZ SER-082 (10nmol/0.1microl), a preferential 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist. These data suggest that 5HT(2C) receptors located within the amygdaloid complex (but not the dorsal or ventral hippocampus) play a facilitatory role in plus-maze anxiety in mice."
"Ethological assessment of murine models of Huntington's disease (HD), an inherited neurodegenerative disorder, enables correlation between phenotype and pathophysiology. Currently, the most characterized model is the R6/2 line that develops a progressive behavioral and neurological phenotype by 6 weeks of age. A recently developed knock-in model with 140 CAG repeats (KI) exhibits a subtle phenotype with a longer progressive course, more typical of adult-onset HD in humans. We evaluated rotarod performance, open-field behavior, and motor activity across the diurnal cycle in KI mice during early to mid-adulthood. Although we did not observe any effects of age, relative to wild-type (WT) mice, KI mice showed significant deficits in both open-field climbing behavior and home-cage running wheel activity during the light phase of the diurnal cycle. An interesting sex difference also emerged. KI females spent more time in the open-field grooming and more time running during the diurnal dark phase than KI males and WT mice of both sexes. In striatum, the primary site of HD pathology, we measured behavior-related changes in extracellular ascorbate (AA), which is abnormally low in the R6/2 line, consistent with a loss of antioxidant protection in HD. KI males exhibited a 20-40% decrease in striatal AA from anesthesia baseline to behavioral activation that was not observed in other groups. Collectively, our results indicate behavioral deficits in KI mice that may be specific to the diurnal cycle. Furthermore, sex differences observed in behavior and striatal AA release suggest sex-dependent variation in the phenotype and neuropathology of HD."
"Elements of the septo-preoptic basal forebrain complex, particularly the lateral and medial septum, the diagonal band of Broca, and the magnocellular preoptic area, have been linked to medial forebrain bundle (MFB) self-stimulation. This study examines the roles of these areas in MFB self-stimulation by temporarily inactivating them with 25 and 50ng doses of the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol. Changes in performance capacity and stimulation reward effectiveness were evaluated with the rate-frequency curve shift paradigm. When infused into the lateral and medial septum and the vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca, both doses of muscimol were as ineffective as saline in altering either the rats' maximum rate of response for stimulation or the frequency required to maintain half-maximal response rate (required frequency). However, when infused into the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca or the magnocellular preoptic area, muscimol substantially decreased maximal response rate and modestly increased required frequency. Changes in maximum rate were dose-dependent, but changes in required frequency were not. Muscimol infusions contralateral to the stimulated hemisphere were as effective as ipsilateral infusions; bilateral infusions tended to so suppress responding that resulting rate-frequency curves were often invalid. These results suggest a role in MFB self-stimulation for only the ventrolateral components of the septo-preoptic complex, and support past observations of considerable bilaterality in the neural systems that support self-stimulation."
"Warming from hibernation to cenothermia involves intense metabolic activity and large fluxes in regional blood flow and volume. During this transition, levels of the antioxidants, ascorbate (AA), urate and glutathione (GSH) in brain tissue, extracellular fluid (ECF) and plasma change substantially. Striatal ECF was sampled and manipulated using very slow perfusion microdialysis to examine the mechanisms that influence the changing profile of striatal ECF AA, urate and GSH levels during arousal from hibernation to cenothermia in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Omission of glucose from the perfusate had no effect upon the respective decrease, increase and transient increase in striatal ECF levels of AA, GSH and urate observed during arousal from hibernation to cenothermia. In contrast, inhibition of xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase (XOR) activity by reverse dialysis with oxypurinol, itself a free radical scavenger, decreased ECF urate and preserved ECF AA levels. This suggests that some ECF AA is oxidized by free radical products of XOR flux and/or by other free radical producing processes activated during the transition from hibernation to cenothermia. Local supplementation of ECF AA, GSH and cystiene had no effect upon the profile of transient increase of ECF urate observed during arousal from hibernation. The production of free radicals by XOR and the disappearance of AA from the ECF continues for at least 2h immediately after the hamster has attained cenothermia. The hamster, immediately after arousal from hibernation, can be utilized as a natural model to study free radical production and effective scavenging at cenothermia."
"In a pilot study we have injected the amygdala of five female pigs (age 8 weeks) with acetylcholine (ACh, 5.5muM/20mul) and recorded short latency utterances. The evoked vocalizations displayed the characteristics of natural screams in sonagram appearance and hearing impression. Quantitative analyses, too, revealed the similarity of the ACh-evoked vocalizations with natural screaming. The results demonstrate for the first time that aversive vocalizations can be triggered by cholinergic amygdala stimulation."
"Prenatal exposure of animals to bacterial endotoxin is an experimental model of systemic maternal infection in the human pregnancy. Previous studies in the rat have demonstrated that such exposure is associated with long term alterations to hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis development. Typically, these animals display an elevated HPA response to stress in adulthood. As neural development is more similar in the human and the guinea pig than the rat, this study adopted a guinea pig model of pregnancy to explore the effects of endotoxin exposure on the HPA axis in the offspring. The offspring of dams exposed to endotoxin exhibited an attenuated cortisol response to the novel environment stress in the weaning period. The degree to which this cortisol response was both buffered by the mother's presence, and habituated to on repeated exposure, differed significantly between the prenatal treatment groups. In adulthood, a diminished cortisol response to the immune challenge was only evident in the female offspring, while both male and female offspring exhibited altered febrile responses. The results of the present study indicate that prenatal bacterial exposure in the guinea pig results in offspring with lower cortisol responses to stress in later life. These findings contrast past research that has used the rat to model pregnancy. As such, the use of the guinea pig to model infection may provide a useful alternative model of human pregnancy to explore programming effects."
"The arginine vasopressin (AVP) system plays an important role in social behavior. Autism, with its hallmark disturbances in social behavior, has been associated with the V1a receptor (V1aR) gene. Furthermore, impairments of social function are often observed in symptoms of schizophrenia. Subchronic phencyclidine (PCP) produces behaviors relating to certain aspects of schizophrenic symptoms such as impairing social interaction in animals and it reduces the density of V1aR binding sites in several brain regions. Here, we report that V1aR knockout (KO) mice exhibited impairment of social behavior in a social interaction test, and showed reduced anxiety-related behavior in elevated plus-maze and marble-burying behavior tests. Given the current findings, the V1aR may be involved in the regulation of social interaction, and V1aR KO mice could be used as an animal model of psychiatric disorders associated with social behavior deficits, such as autism and schizophrenia."
"Control, right and left HF lesioned homing pigeons (Columba livia) were trained to locate a goal in one corner of a rectangular enclosure with a distinctive feature cue. Probe tests revealed that all groups were able to encode in parallel geometric (enclosure shape) and feature information, and in the absence of one of them, they could us the other to locate the goal. However, left HF lesioned pigeons learned the task at a faster rate, and when the geometric and feature information were set in conflict, they relied more on the feature cue compared to control and right HF lesioned pigeons. It was also found that pigeons, independent of group, trained to a goal adjacent to the feature cue learned the task in fewer sessions and relied more on feature information compared to pigeons trained to a goal opposite the feature cue. The latter group relied more on geometric information. The results support the hypothesis that the left HF plays a more important role in the representation of a goal location with respect to environmental shape/geometry. We further propose that the observed functional asymmetry can be explained by the lateralized properties of the pigeon tectofugal visual system."
"The inferior olive (IO) is a required component of neural circuits controlling the classical conditioning of eyeblink responses. Previous reports indicated that lesioning or inactivating the IO abolishes conditioned eyeblinks (CRs), but there was disagreement regarding the timing of the CR performance deficit. As a result, it was not clear whether IO inactivation produces unlearning of CRs or a non-specific dysfunction of cerebellar circuits. Since most of these studies used methods that could block unrelated axons passing through the IO region, additional experiments are required to further elucidate IO function, using inactivating agents that act selectively on cell bodies. In the present study, the IO was inactivated using the glutamate receptor antagonist DGG and the GABA-A receptor agonist muscimol in rabbits performing well-learned CRs. Effects of inactivating the IO on CR expression and on neuronal activity in the anterior cerebellar interposed nucleus (IN) were examined. We found that either blocking excitatory glutamate inputs or activating inhibitory GABA inputs to the IO abolished CRs. This effect occurred with variable delay following drug injections. Additional experiments, in which post-injection testing was delayed to allow for drug diffusion, revealed invariably immediate suppression of CRs. This demonstrated that suppressing IO activity using DGG or muscimol does not induce unlearning of CRs. Single-unit recording during DGG injections revealed that CR suppression was paralleled by a dramatic suppression of IN neuronal activity. We concluded that inactivating the rostral parts of the IO complex abolishes CRs by producing a tonic malfunction of cerebellar eyeblink conditioning circuits."
"Protein synthesis inhibitors block consolidation of memory and may also block the reconsolidation of a reactivated memory in paradigms of aversive learning, but the evidence for reconsolidation effects is conflicting in appetitive paradigms. We now report that intra-cerebroventricular (ICV) anisomycin (400microg) prevents consolidation of morphine-induced place preference (CPP), but does not impair its reconsolidation unless the reactivation procedure associates anisomycin with the morphine context. Rats were injected alternately with morphine (5mg/kg, IP) or vehicle, and confined to one of two distinctive compartments in a three compartment apparatus. On a subsequent day rats were allowed to choose the compartment they preferred in a 20min test session. In the first experiment, rats that were injected with vehicle or with anisomycin before or 3h after training sessions, developed a CPP. However, rats that received anisomycin ICV immediately after training sessions did not develop a CPP. In experiment 2, rats received no ICV injections during initial training. Once a CPP was established, they received four additional training sessions on which they received vehicle or anisomycin ICV. All groups continued to prefer the morphine-paired compartment after reactivation sessions with vehicle or anisomycin ICV. In experiment 3, ICV anisomycin was administered selectively on morphine-paired reactivation trials or saline-paired reactivation trials and the CPP was weakened or strengthened, respectively. This suggests that associations between aversive effects of the amnestic treatment and the morphine context might mimic disruption of reconsolidation."
"We observed that intrathecal (i.t.) bovine adrenal medulla 22, an endogenous opioid peptide, partially reverses morphine tolerance. However, its mechanism remains unclear. The present study determined the effects of BAM8-22, a derivative of BAM22 and selective sensory neuron-specific receptor (SNSR) agonist, on the development and maintenance of tolerance to spinal morphine. Intrathecal administration of BAM8-22 at various doses (0.1, 1 and 10nmol) did not alter withdraw latencies assessed in both paw withdraw and tail flick tests. Co-administration of BAM8-22 (0.1nmol) every other day, but not daily, with morphine remarkably attenuated the development of morphine tolerance. Pretreatment and co-treatment with BAM8-22 (0.1nmol) significantly reversed established morphine tolerance. Furthermore, intermittent administration of BAM8-22 with morphine consistently resumed morphine-induced antinociception. However, i.t. BAM8-22 did not alter morphine-induced hyperalgesia. These results suggested that SNSR may be able to modulate the sensitivity of opioid receptor serving as a most probable underlying mechanism for the effects of BAM8-22 on morphine tolerance. This study also demonstrated that intermittent combination of SNSR agonist BAM8-22 with morphine might be better regimen for long-term use of opioids to treat chronic pain."
"Previous studies have established a relationship between sleep disruption and pain, and it has been suggested that hyperalgesia induced by paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) could be due to a reduction of opioidergic neurotransmission in the brain. In the present study rats deprived of sleep for 96 h as well as rats allowed to recover for 24h after PSD and normal controls received vehicle or morphine (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) and were tested on a hot plate 1h later. Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to map alterations in binding to brain mu-opioid receptors in separate groups. Results demonstrated that PSD induced a significant reduction in thermal pain threshold, as measured by paw withdrawal latencies. This effect did not return to baseline control values after 24h of sleep recovery. The usual analgesic effect of morphine was observed in the control group but not in PSD or rebound groups except at the highest dose (10 mg/kg). Binding of [3H]DAMGO to mu sites did not differ significantly among the three groups in any of the 33 brain regions examined. These results do not exclude the participation of the opioid system in PSD-induced pain hypersensitivity since sleep-deprived rats were clearly resistant to morphine. However, the fact no changes were seen in [3H]DAMGO binding indicates that mechanisms other than altered mu-opioid binding must be sought to explain the phenomenon."
"As part of ongoing efforts to develop fully automated and standardized behavioral tasks to probe cognitive and mnemonic capabilities of mice, we have constructed a new rectangular operant chamber. The chamber contains numerous nose poke holes, distributed over three of its inner walls that are identifiable by their spatial locations. Using this apparatus, we have developed a 'spatial' memory task using a successive reversal discrimination paradigm. Mice learn to discriminate, by trial and error, the position of a single valid hole during a Presentation session wherein they obtained a maximum of 20 reinforcements or 15 min time elapsed. Following a delay interval, they were resubmitted to the same task (Test) using the same reinforced hole. Results indicated that C57BL/6 mice exhibited a significant improvement during the Test, the magnitude of the improvement (memory savings) being dependent on the length of retention intervals ranging from 5 min to 24h. In addition, discrimination performance was sensitive to scopolamine in a dose dependent manner. The simplicity in task set up and the minimal labor and space requirements make this task suitable for high throughput behavioral characterization of genetically modified mice."
"There is considerable evidence of interactions between adenosine A2A receptors and dopamine D2 receptors in striatal areas, and antagonists of the A2A receptor have been shown to reverse the motor effects of DA antagonists in animal models. The D2 antagonist haloperidol produces parkinsonism in humans, and also induces motor effects in rats, such as suppression of locomotion. The present experiments were conducted to study the ability of the adenosine A2A antagonist MSX-3 to reverse the locomotor effects of acute or subchronic administration of haloperidol in rats. Systemic (i.p.) injections of MSX-3 (2.5-10.0 mg/kg) were capable of attenuating the suppression of locomotion induced by either acute or repeated (i.e., 14 day) administration of 0.5 mg/kg haloperidol. Bilateral infusions of MSX-3 directly into the nucleus accumbens core (2.5 microg or 5.0 microg in 0.5 microl per side) produced a dose-related increase in locomotor activity in rats treated with 0.5 mg/kg haloperidol either acutely or repeatedly. There were no overall significant effects of MSX-3 infused directly into the dorsomedial nucleus accumbens shell or the ventrolateral neostriatum. These results indicate that antagonism of adenosine A2A receptors can attenuate the locomotor suppression produced by DA antagonism, and that this effect may be at least partially mediated by A2A receptors in the nucleus accumbens core. These studies suggest that adenosine and dopamine systems interact to modulate the locomotor and behavioral activation functions of nucleus accumbens core."
"Bats, like other mammals, use communication calls for social interaction, but rely at the same time on sophisticated echolocation systems for orientation and prey capture. Both call types are of laryngeal origin, but can be distinguished on the basis of their spectral and temporal features and apparently their functional involvement as well. Although they share a common final motor pathway, there is evidence that separate vocally active brainstem areas are involved in the functional control of communication and echolocation calls. This review summarizes findings that support the above assumption, and focus on the functional involvement of the periaqueductal gray, the paralemniscal area, and the nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus, in differentiated vocal control."
"Motor skill learning, but not mere motor activity, is associated with an increase in both synapse number and glial cell volume within the cerebellar cortex. The increase in synapse number has been shown to persist for at least 4 weeks in the absence of continued training. The present experiment similarly examined how a prolonged interruption in training affects the training-induced increase in astrocytic volume. Adult female rats were randomly allocated to either an acrobatic motor learning condition (AC) or a motor control condition (MC). The AC animals were trained to traverse a complex series of obstacles and each AC animal was pair matched with an MC animal that traversed an obstacle-free runway. These groups were further assigned to one of three training conditions. Animals in the early condition were trained for 10 consecutive days, animals in the delay condition received the same 10 days of training followed by a 28-day period without training, and animals in the continuous condition were trained for the entire 38 days. Unbiased stereological techniques were used to determine that AC animals had a significantly greater volume of astrocytes per Purkinje cell in the cerebellar paramedian lobule than the MC animals, a difference which was reduced (and not statistically detectable) among animals in the delay condition. These findings demonstrate that learning triggers the hypertrophy of astrocytic processes and furthermore that, unlike learning-induced synaptogenesis, astrocytic growth is reduced in the absence of continued training."
"Excitotoxic lesion of the striatum provides a useful model for evaluating the excitotoxic processes involved in neurological disorders, in particular stroke diseases. The behavioural outcome after such injury is however poorly described. We have therefore investigated the potential behavioural deficits induced by a NMDA-induced excitotoxic unilateral lesion of the lateral part of the striatum, by comparison with a PBS striatal injection (sham procedure), and non-operated mice behaviour. Three groups of male adult Swiss mice were constituted: unilateral NMDA (20 nmol striatal NMDA injection), sham (striatal PBS injection), and control (healthy non-operated mice). From 14 to 29 days post-surgery, sensorimotor and mnesic tests were performed in all groups. After euthanasia, immunohistochemical stainings (NeuN and GFAP) were performed in order to assess the size of the lesion. Straight runway and passive avoidance performances revealed mild deficits related to the excitotoxic NMDA-induced lesion as compared to the sham procedure. Moreover, accelerated rotarod and Morris water maze acquisition performances also revealed deficits related to the surgery, i.e. observed in sham-operated as compared to control mice. NeuN staining revealed no striatal lesion in the sham and non-operated groups in contrast to the NMDA-injected group in which the volume of infarcted striatum was 2.4+/-0.3mm3. GFAP staining revealed a glial reaction in the lesioned striatum of NMDA animals and at the PBS injection site in sham animals. These results suggest that NMDA-induced excitotoxic lesion induces subtle long-term behavioural deficits in mice. Moreover, this study shows the importance of the sham group to investigate the behavioural deficits after excitotoxic lesion models in mice."
"Coordination in biological systems requires a continuous updating of the perception-action cycle. How the different sources of sensory information contribute uniquely to performance is still debated. Here, we directly compared the role of vision and kinesthesis by means of a tracking task in which the left wrist mimicked the passive motions imposed on the right wrist with a torque motor. The passive movements were perceived visually (alien hand) or kinesthetically (own hand), or a combination thereof (own hand, feel and see). Tracking occurred according to the same (isodirectional) or opposite (mirror-image) directions. Findings revealed that visual tracking was performed most successfully in the isodirectional and kinesthetic tracking in the mirror-image mode. Tracking was most successful when both sources of sensory information were present. These results suggest that vision and proprioception obey direction-dependent constraints that are consistent with extrinsic and intrinsic reference frames within which the perception-action cycle resides. Thus, each sensory modality contributes uniquely as a function of the spatial requirements of the tracking task, rather than one being superior over the other."
"Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemic brain injury. Flavonoids from various herbal extracts have been shown to be neuroprotective in experimental models of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). The present study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of the biflavone rich fraction from Araucaria bidwillii Hook (ABH) (Family: Araucariaceae) in I/R induced oxidative stress. The I/R was induced by occluding bilateral common carotid arteries (BCCAO) for 30 min, followed by 24 h reperfusion. BCCAO caused significant depletion in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and significant increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO) in various brain regions. The neurological deficit and sensory motor function were also decreased significantly by BCCAO group as compared to sham group animals. All the alteration induced by cerebral ischemia was significantly attenuated by 7 days' pretreatment with biflavone fraction (BFR) at the dose of 100 and 200 mg/kg, comparable to that given by Vitamin E (200 mg/kg). Consistent with neurobehavioral deficits, pretreatment with biflavones at higher doses significantly reduced ischemia-induced neuronal loss of the brain. In conclusion the biflavone rich fraction from A. bidwillii was found to protect rat brain against I/R induced oxidative stress, and attributable to its antioxidant properties."
"Previous studies evidenced in rats the suppression by cannabinoids of motor stimulant effects of various drugs of abuse. Here we investigated, in mice, the effects of an acute or a chronic administration with the cannabinoid agonist HU 210 on the motor stimulant effects of either morphine or alcohol. HU 210 (12.5-200 microg/kg), when acutely administered, antagonized the stimulant effects of morphine (7.5 mg/kg) or alcohol (1 or 1.5 g/kg). A tolerance to this antagonistic interaction with morphine and alcohol occurred after a 7-day or a 14-day HU 210 treatment, leading to the reappearance of morphine- and alcohol-induced stimulation. The CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant (10 mg/kg) enhanced the stimulant effect induced by low doses of morphine (5 or 7.5 mg/kg). Rimonabant (3 or 10 mg/kg) altered the locomotor effect of alcohol in a biphasic manner. It enhanced the stimulant effect of low doses of alcohol (1 or 1.5 g/kg) while decreasing the locomotor activity of mice treated with a high dose (3 g/kg) of alcohol. Furthermore, rimonabant (3 and 10 mg/kg) enhanced the duration of alcohol-induced loss of righting reflex (4 g/kg), suggesting a dual implication of cannabinoidergic pathways in acute effects of alcohol."
"We investigated the role of the two calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin D-28k (CB) in the locomotor activity and motor coordination using null-mutant mice for PV (PV-/-), CB (CB-/-) or both proteins (PV-/-CB-/-). These proteins are expressed in distinct, mainly non-overlapping populations of neurons of the central and peripheral nervous system and PV additionally in fast-twitch muscles. In a test measuring repeated locomotor activity during 18-20 days, the analysis revealed a slightly increased activity in mice lacking either protein, while the lack of both decreased the number of beams crossed during active periods. An increase in the characteristic speed during the first 8 days could be attributed to PV-deficiency, while the elimination of CB in CB-/- and double-KO mice decreased the percentage of fast movements at all time points. In the latter, additionally a reduction of the fastest speed was observed. The alterations in locomotor activity (fast movements, fastest speed) strongly correlate with the impairment in locomotor coordination in mice deficient for CB evidenced in the runway assay and the rotarod assay. The graded locomotor phenotype (CB&gt;PV) is qualitatively correlated with alterations in Purkinje cell firing reported previously in these mice. The presence or absence of either protein did not affect the spontaneous locomotor activity when animals were placed in a novel environment and tested only once for 30 min. In summary, the lack of these calcium-binding proteins yields characteristic, yet distinct phenotypes with respect to locomotor activity and coordination."
"In order to probe the nature and validity of olfactory bulbectomized (OB) rats as a model of depression, we reevaluated their behavioural and neurochemical deficits in relation to the symptoms and neurochemical abnormalities of depression using our protocols, which distinguish anhedonia-resembling behaviour in sexual behavioural test, the hippocampus (Hip)-dependent long-term memory and anxiety-resembling behaviour specially. Besides exploratory hyperactivity in response to a novel environmental stress resembling the psychomotor agitation, OB rats showed a decrease of libido, and a deficit of long-term explicit memory, resembling loss of interest and cognitive deficits in depressive patients, respectively. OB rats also exhibited the anxiety symptom-resembling behaviour in social interaction and plus-maze tests. In the OB rats, we found degenerated neurons in the piriform cortex, decreased protein expression of NMDA receptor subunit 1 (NR1), but not NR2A or NR2B, in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), Hip and amygdala (Amg), and decreased phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) in the PFC and Hip, but not Amg. The behavioural and neurochemical abnormalities in OB rats, except for the performance in the plus-maze task and neuronal degeneration, were significantly attenuated by repeated treatment with desipramine (10 mg/kg), a typical antidepressant. The present study indicated that OB rats may be a model of depression with comorbid anxiety, characterized by agitation, sexual and cognitive dysfunction, neuronal degeneration, decreased protein expression of NR1, and decreased phosphorylation of CREB."
"Sexual dysfunction in the female has been associated with a decrease in androgen levels, which can be reversed by testosterone treatment, however, bearing the risk of adverse side effects. Nasally administered testosterone could be an effective method for androgenic treatment avoiding the first-pass intestinal and hepatic metabolism and side effects. Here we examined the effects of chronic intranasal administration of testosterone on sexual behavior in female capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) that lived with male cohorts. During 8 days of baseline 10 females were observed for their sexual and non-sexual behavior without drug. They then received daily intranasal testosterone (0.24 mg per nostril, n=5 per group) or placebo gel for 5 days, followed by 5 days of wash out, followed by 5 days of daily intranasal application, whereby the animals that had received testosterone before, now received placebo and vice versa. Diverse sexual and non-sexual behaviors were scored. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for testosterone, estradiol, dihydrotestosterone and progesterone using EIAs. The results revealed an increase in sexual behavior (eyebrow raising, chest rubbing, courtship behavior, masturbation) in the females during testosterone treatment, which seemed to be prolonged even when testosterone treatment was discontinued. These behavioral results were accompanied by an increase in plasma testosterone levels. This study demonstrates the efficacy of testosterone in enhancing sexual behavior in female capuchin monkeys by means of intranasal application, which may be a useful alternative compared to other forms of administration."
"Rats selectively bred for ""Fast"" or ""Slow"" kindling epileptogenesis express different GABA(A) receptor subunits that may account for differences in their miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs). The neurosteroid tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC), an endogenous modulator of GABA-mediated inhibition with anesthetic properties and effects on mnemonic processes, preferentially enhances the mIPSCs recorded from the interneurons of Fast rats. Here we show that the anesthetic effect of 20 mg/kg THDOC was reduced in Fast compared to Slow rats. Further, as the strains have previously been shown to differ in their spatial learning abilities, we subsequently examined the effect of a lower dose (5 mg/kg) of THDOC on their performance in the Morris water maze using a matching-to-place paradigm. THDOC injection deteriorated the usually superior mnemonic capabilities of the Slow rats, i.e., concept learning as well as working and reference memory, while marginally improving these behaviors in Fast rats. These outcomes may reflect the divergent expression of GABAA receptors or disinhibition on interneurons versus principal cells that have been observed between the two strains. Possible mechanisms are discussed."
"Male mice with a null mutation of Mchr1, encoding melanin concentrating hormone receptor-1, were compared to wild-type on two background strains. Mchr1 knockout (KO) mice were more active than 129/SvEv and C57BL/6J wild-type strains in a photocell actimeter. In addition, Mchr1 KO mice on the C57BL/6J background were less anxious in the elevated plus-maze, while on the 129/SvEv background, the mutants were less emotionally reactive as estimated by fecal boli and handling-related vocalization. There was no detrimental impact of the null mutation on motor coordination and spatial learning. Mchr1 KO mice had shorter latencies before reaching the escape platform, but only on the 129/SvEv background. Null mutants were lighter than C57BL/6J controls but heavier than 129/SvEv controls, attributable to interactions with strain-dependent genes."
"Monocular sleep following passive avoidance learning was investigated in young chicks. One group of animals (Experimental Group) was presented with a bead coated with an aversive substance; a second group (Control Group 1) underwent bead presentations as in the Experimental Group but with the bead coated with water rather than with the aversive substance, and a third group (Control Group 2) did not undergo to any bead presentation. Binocular and monocular sleep was recorded during the 8h subsequent the learning (or the control) event. The main results were that (1) the percentage of time spent in binocular sleep and the percentage of episodes of binocular sleep were lower in the Experimental Group that in the Control Groups; (2) the times spent in monocular sleep was higher in the Experimental Group and progressively lower in Control Group 1 and Control Group 2; (3) chicks slept predominantly with their left eye closed, but there was no evidence of specific changes in the opening of their right or left eyes associated with the learning event. The results seem to be compatible with the hypothesis that monocular sleep serves to provide the animal with the possibility to monitor periodically the environment to look for important events (e.g. predators, presence of the mother hen and siblings) and any arousal-producing event that would occur before a sleep episode tends to increase the likelihood of monocular sleeping."
"This study was conducted to determine the effects of xenin on appetite related processes in chicks. Chicks were centrally and peripherally administered xenin, and feed and water intake were quantified. Chicks responded with a linear dose-dependent decrease in feed intake to central xenin and had a quadratic type response to peripheral administration. Water intake was not affected by treatment. To determine if the lateral hypothalamus (LH) or ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) was involved in this effect, chicks were both centrally and peripherally injected with xenin and an immunocytochemistry assay for c-Fos was conducted. Central and peripheral xenin caused increased activation of the VMH but had no effect on the LH. Finally, to determine if gastrointestinal transit rate was affected, chicks received central xenin and were gavaged with chicken feed slurry containing a visible marker. Chicks exhibited a quadratic dose-dependent response to transit rate after central xenin. These results suggest that xenin affects feeding and gastrointestinal motility through hypothalamic interactions in chicks."
"Glutamatergic transmission within the nucleus accumbens (Nac) is considered to subserve the transfer of different types of information from the cortical and limbic regions. In particular, it has been suggested that glutamatergic afferences from the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex provide the main source of contextual information to the Nac. Accordingly, several authors have demonstrated that the blockade of glutamate receptors within the Nac impairs various spatial tasks. However, the exact role of the different classes of glutamate receptors within the Nac in short-term spatial memory is still not clear. In this study we investigated the involvement of two major classes of glutamate receptors, NMDA and AMPA receptors, within the Nac in the acquisition of spatial information, using the Morris water maze task. Focal injections of the NMDA antagonist, AP-5 (0.1 and 0.15 microg/side), and the AMPA antagonist, DNQX (0.005, 0.01 microg/side), were performed before a massed training phase, and mice were tested for retention immediately after. NMDA and AMPA receptor blockade induced no effect during training. On the contrary, injection of the two glutamatergic antagonists impaired spatial localization during the probe test. These data demonstrate an involvement of the Nac in short-term spatial learning. Moreover, they prove that within this structure the short-term processing of spatial information needs the activation of both NMDA and AMPA receptors."
"Music is known to be able to elicit emotional changes, including anxiolytic effects. The gonadal steroid hormones estradiol and progesterone have also been reported to play important roles in the modulation of anxiety. In the present study, we examined whether the effect of music on anxiety is related to ovarian steroid in female mice. Behavioral paradigms measuring anxiety were tested in gonadally intact (SHAM) and ovariectomized (OVX) female mice chronically treated with either placebo (OVX/Placebo), 17beta-estradiol (OVX/E), or progesterone (OVX/P). In the elevated plus maze, light-dark transition, and marble burying tests, SHAM and OVX/P mice exposed to music showed less anxiety than those exposed to white noise or silence while OVX/placebo mice did not show these effects at all. OVX/E mice showed the anxiolytic effect of music only in the marble burying test. Furthermore, pretreatment with progesterone's metabolite inhibitor completely prevented the anxiolytic effect of music in behavioral tests, while pretreatment with a progesterone receptor blocker did not prevent the anxiolytic effect of music. These results suggest that exposure to music reduces anxiety levels, and ovarian steroids, mainly progesterone, may be involved in the anxiolytic effect of music observed in female mice."
"Sexual dysfunction in the female has been associated with a decrease in androgen levels, which can be reversed by testosterone treatment, however, bearing the risk of adverse side effects. Previously we found that intranasal application of testosterone led to an increase in proceptive behavior in female capuchin monkeys, which was still enhanced beyond treatment pointing to prolonged effects. Here, we sought to replicate our previous findings and to further examine possible prolonged effects of such treatment. During 5 days of baseline females were observed for their sexual and non-sexual behavior without drug. They then received daily intranasal testosterone (0.24 mg per nostril) for 7 days, followed by 15 days of intranasal testosterone application every third day or were left undisturbed (n=5 per group). Diverse sexual and non-sexual behaviors were scored. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone using immunoenzymatic chemiluminescent immunoassay. In accord with our previous results an increase in sexual proceptive behavior was revealed during testosterone treatment, which persisted about 2 weeks beyond treatment in the group receiving testosterone every third day as well as in the group that no longer received any treatment. These behavioral results were accompanied by an increase in plasma testosterone levels. This study demonstrates the efficacy of testosterone in enhancing sexual behavior in female capuchin monkeys by means of intranasal application, and provided evidence that daily substance application is not necessary to maintain beneficial effects on sexual behavior. These findings render the intranasal application procedure to be a useful alternative compared to other forms of administration."
"In humans, the Simon effect refers to the fact that choice reaction time (RT) is shorter when the stimulus corresponds spatially to the response than when it does not, albeit the location of the stimulus is irrelevant to the task. This effect has motivated innumerable empirical and theoretical studies and is considered to reflect elementary cognitive processes. We report an experiment demonstrating that rats also display a Simon effect, the dynamics of which--as assessed by factorial manipulations and RT distribution analyses--partly corresponds to those of the effect studied in human participants. The present results are consistent with the ideas that in rats, like in humans, (i) the information conveyed by the stimulus is processed via two parallel routes, one controlled and relatively slow, and one fast and automatic (dual-route architecture) and (ii) the dual-route processing is finished before the start of motor processes. The correspondence between these findings and those reported in humans open new perspectives for neurophysiological investigations of the dual-route architecture in an animal model routinely studied in neuroscience research."
"In the signal attenuation rat model of obsessive-compulsive disorder, 'compulsive' behavior is induced by attenuating a signal indicating that a lever-press response was effective in producing food. In recent years several studies have reported that Lewis rats, an inbred strain derived from the Sprague Dawley strain, exhibit addictive and/or compulsive tendencies. The aim of the present study was thus to test whether Lewis rats will also show increased compulsivity in the signal attenuation model. Because the model has been developed and validated using Wistar rats only, the present study compared the behavioral response to signal attenuation of Lewis, Sprague Dawley and Wistar rats, and assessed the effects of the anti-compulsive drug paroxetine on compulsive behavior in Lewis and Sprague Dawley rats. The results show that Lewis rats are more 'compulsive' than Sprague Dawley and Wistar rats in terms of both higher levels of compulsive lever-pressing and higher resistance to the anti-compulsive effect of paroxetine. The possibility that these strain differences are related to strain differences in the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems are discussed in light of current knowledge of the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of OCD."
"Ovariectomized rats with bilateral cannulae near the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus were hormonally primed with 10 microg estradiol benzoate and 500 microg progesterone. Sexually receptive females were infused bilaterally with 200 ng of the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), or with a combination of 200 ng 8-OH-DPAT and 2000 ng of the 5-HT(2) receptor agonist, (+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl-2-aminopropane HCl (DOI). 8-OH-DPAT inhibited lordosis behavior and DOI reduced this inhibition. However, if females were preinfused with the PKC inhibitor, bisindolymaleimide I hydrochloride (BIM), DOI's effect was eliminated. BIM's attenuation of the effects of DOI was time-dependent. When BIM was infused 90 min, but not 30 min, before the 5-HT receptor agonists, BIM eliminated DOI's protection against the lordosis-inhibiting effects of 8-OH-DPAT. A concentration of BIM as low as 10(-5) nmol in a 0.5 microl infusion volume was effective and there was little evidence of dose responsivity between 10(-5) and 10(-1) nmol of BIM. In contrast, prior infusion with vehicle or with 10(-7) nmol BIM had no impact on the female's response to the 5-HT receptor agonists. These findings allow the suggestion that DOI's ability to increase PKC may be responsible for attenuation of the effects of 8-OH-DPAT on lordosis behavior."
"Intact cerebellar structures (i.e., deep nuclei and perhaps cortex) are essential for acquisition of both simple delay and trace eyeblink (EB) conditioning. However, successful trace conditioning also requires intact cortico-limbic structures (i.e., hippocampus, medial thalamus, and medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC). A direct connection between the cerebellum and ventrolateral thalamic nuclei (VLTN) has been demonstrated in several species. Since VLTN projects to both premotor and prefrontal cortex, it may be an essential link in a cerebellar-thalamic-prefrontal circuit that provides the CNS substrate for acquisition of the trace EB CR. The current studies thus assessed the role of the VLTN on trace EB conditioning in New Zealand albino rabbits. We first verified afferent connections to the mPFC (Brodmann's area 32) from the VLTN, by injecting the retrograde tracer Flourogold(c) into area 32. Strong labeling in VLTN from terminal projections to mPFC were found. We next assessed the role of VLTN in trace eyeblink conditioning in animals that received either sham or ibotenic acid VLTN lesions. EB conditioning began with 10 consecutive daily sessions of trace conditioning, followed immediately by 4 days of extinction, and then 4 days of delay conditioning. VLTN lesions significantly impaired acquisition of both trace and delay conditioning, and impaired extinction. These findings, thus confirm the importance of the VLTN in a postulated cerebellar-thalamic-prefrontal circuit that underlies successful trace, as well as delay EB conditioning."
"Spatial learning and memory deficits in the APP23 transgenic mice have mainly been studied using the Morris water maze (MWM). However learning in the MWM relies on swimming abilities and may be confounded by the stressful nature of this test. We have therefore assessed spatial learning and memory in 12-month-old APP23 using a dry-land maze test developed by Barnes. Mice were given daily learning trials for a total of 41 successive days. After a 12-day interval the mice were re-tested for 4 additional days in order to examine the spatial memory retention. Immediately following this phase, reversal learning was examined for 13 additional days by moving the escape tunnel to the opposite position. During the initial learning phase, APP23 mice showed a significantly longer latency to find the escape tunnel as well as an increased number of errors compared to non-transgenic littermates. These deficits appeared to be due to a delay in switching from a ""no strategy"" to a spatial strategy. Indeed, this same delay in the use of spatial strategy was observed in the reversal phase of the study. Our results suggest that impairments in APP23 mice in learning and memory maze tests may be due to a specific deficit in the use of spatial strategy."
"Some but not other forms of prenatal stress have been shown to impair spatial memory in adult male offspring. It is not clear if this is because of the intensity of the stress, age of rats, or the way in which learning is assessed. We examined the effect of daily varied prenatal stress consisting of 30 min restraint, saline injections and 15 min forced swim on day 17-21 of gestation on spatial learning, synaptic plasticity and the expression of key proteins of the post synaptic density (PSD) in the hippocampus of males aged 4-5 weeks. Prenatal stress impaired spatial learning in the Morris water maze and induced a significant decrease in long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices. There was no change in the paired pulse facilitation ratio but there was a significant reduction in the expression of the NR2B subunit of the glutamate type NMDA receptor and the GluR1 subunit of the AMPA receptor, both of which are important modulators of LTP. These changes were accompanied by a remarkable increase in the scaffolding protein PSD95, which interacts with the intracellular carboxy terminal domains of the NR2 subunits. The high levels of PSD95 may have contributed to the impairment of LTP by disrupting the clustering of NMDA receptors in CA1 synapses. The alteration by prenatal stress in the relative amounts of scaffolding proteins and those which compose glutamate receptors could explain the depression of LTP and impairment in the acquisition of spatial learning."
"The goal of the present experiments was to use a disconnection paradigm to test the interactions between the hippocampus and parietal cortex (PC) during an object-place paired associate learning task, dry-land water maze task, and a reaction-to-change task. Previous research indicates that these tasks are sensitive to hippocampal or PC disruption. Unilateral lesions were made to the dorsal hippocampus or posterior PC in contralateral hemispheres or ipsilateral hemispheres. It was hypothesized that if the hippocampus and PC interact, then contralateral lesioned animals should be markedly impaired compared to ipsilateral lesions. The results indicate that contralateral lesioned animals were significantly more impaired than animals with ipsilateral lesions during object-place paired-associate learning; however, both groups readily learned single discriminations (i.e., objects or places). Furthermore, contralateral lesioned animals traveled further to find the reward during acquisition of the dry-land water maze task and spent less time in the rewarded quadrant during the probe trial. Conversely, contralateral lesioned animals' performance matched ipsilateral lesioned animals during the reaction-to-change paradigm. Thus, the hippocampus and PC interact during some tasks, presumably when tasks require multiple trials across days, but not during the detection of novelty within a single day."
"Despite the evidence that ultrasonic vocalizations are a consistent component of the behavioural repertoire of female mice, only few studies have investigated this phenomenon. In this paper, we reported new data about ultrasonic vocalisations emitted during female-female mice social encounters. In particular, we first showed that the resident female utters a considerable number of 70 kHz calls and that the number of calls seems to be modulated by the motivational state of the emitter during the estrous cycle: sexually receptive females emitted fewer ultrasonic vocalizations than non-receptive ones in the presence of a female intruder. A strong positive correlation linked the number of calls and the time spent by the resident sniffing the intruder female. Moreover, the number of calls uttered during interaction with an unknown female partner significantly decreased with pregnancy and ageing. Secondly we reported that 1-year-old female mice showed a reduction of ultrasonic calls in the presence of a partner they had been exposed to, only if the re-exposure (test) occurred 30 min after the previous presentation. If the test was performed with a delay of 60 min, the number of calls emitted did not decrease. These results confirm that ultrasonic vocalizations emitted during social interaction with a female conspecific can be used as an index of social recognition and can be useful to detect age-related disruption of social memory in female mice."
"Bombesin (BB)-like peptides have been implicated in the mediation and/or modulation of the stress response. However, the impact of manipulating this peptidergic system has only been assessed in a limited number of anxiety and fear paradigms. Given that different behavioral paradigms reflect different aspects of anxiety, the objective of the present investigation was to assess the effects of two mammalian BB-related peptides, namely gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and neuromedin B (NMB), in paradigms thought to reflect fear and anxiety-related behaviors. To this end, the effects of central (3rd ventricular; i.c.v.) administration of GRP (0.30 nmol), GRP receptor (BB(2)) antagonist, [Leu(13)-(CH(2)NH)Leu(14)]-BN (1.26 nmol), NMB-30 (0.29 nmol), NMB (BB(1)) receptor antagonist, BIM 23127 (1.70 nmol) and a mixed BB(1)/BB(2) receptor antagonist, PD 176252 (0.621 nmol) were assessed in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and in a fear potentiated startle paradigm (a model thought to reflect conditioned fear). The BB(1) receptor antagonist and the mixed BB(1)/BB(2) receptor antagonist elicited anxiolytic effects in the EPM, whereas, the BB(2) receptor antagonist was without effect. In the fear potentiated startle paradigm, pretreatment with either the BB(1) receptor antagonist or the BB(2) receptor agonist attenuated the fear potentiated startle response, without affecting basal startle amplitude. These data suggest that NMB and GRP do affect the stress response. However, whereas NMB manipulations affected both anxiety and fear responses, GRP alterations selectively affected fear-related responses."
"Sequential learning has been extensively studied in humans using the serial reaction time (SRT) paradigm, and has contributed significantly to the description of the neurobiological processes and substrates underlying different memory systems. More precisely, patients with basal ganglia, but not medial temporal lobe pathology exhibit selective deficits in this task, qualified as implicit learning, since this learning occurs without any conscious awareness of the subjects. While, the construction of transgenic mouse models of human neurological diseases has created a great need for developing mouse analogs of this or other types of human memory tasks, only a few studies exist in rodents, and more specifically in mice. The present study is aimed at examining a SRT protocol for mice using our new operant chamber designed to be polyvalent for different experimental conditions and uses. We provide data for learning by normal C57BL/6 mice of a repeating sequence of 12 nose poke responses, first, via the observation of increases in reaction times when repeated sequence is replaced by random sequence, and, second, by analysis of behavior during transfer trials in which one sequential element is discretely replaced by a new item. The potential of our protocol for dissecting the different neural systems of learning and memory is discussed as well as its usefulness for the validation of transgenic mouse models of human neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease."
"Stress plays a key role in pathogenesis of anxiety and depression. Animal models of these disorders are widely used in behavioral neuroscience to explore stress-evoked brain abnormalities, screen anxiolytic/antidepressant drugs and establish behavioral phenotypes of gene-targeted or transgenic animals. Here we discuss the current situation with these experimental models, and critically evaluate the state of the art in this field. Noting a deficit of fresh ideas and especially new paradigms for animal anxiety and depression models, we review existing challenges and outline important directions for further research in this field."
"Embryonic stem (ES) cells have been investigated in many animal models of injury and disease. However, few studies have examined the ability of pre-differentiated ES cells to improve functional outcome following traumatic brain injury (TBI). The purpose of the present study was to compare the effect of murine ES cells that were pre-differentiated into GABAergic neurons or astrocytes on functional recovery following TBI. Neural and astrocyte induction was achieved by co-culturing ES cells on a bone marrow stromal fibroblast (M2-10B4) feeder layer and incubating them with various mitogenic factors. Rats were initially prepared with a unilateral controlled cortical contusion injury of the sensorimotor cortex or sham procedure. Rats were transplanted 7 days following injury with approximately 100K GABAergic neurons, astrocytes, fibroblasts, or media. Animals were assessed on a battery of sensorimotor tasks following transplantation. The stromal fibroblast cells (M2-10B4), as a control cell line, did not differ significantly from media infusions. Transplantation of GABAergic neurons facilitated complete and total recovery on the vibrissae-forelimb placing test as opposed to all other groups, which failed to show any recovery. It was also found that GABAergic neurons reduced the magnitude of the initial impairment on the limb use test. Histological analysis revealed infiltration of host brain with transplanted neurons and astrocytes. The results of the present study suggest that transplantation of pre-differentiated GABAergic neurons significantly induces recovery of sensorimotor function; whereas, astrocytes do not."
"Four groups of male C57BL/6 mice were reared differing combinations of the two environments from 3 to 11 weeks after birth. At 12 and 13 weeks they were assessed by measures of behaviour and learning: open-field activity, auditory startle reflex and prepulse inhibition, water maze learning, and passive avoidance. Another four groups of mice reared under these varying conditions were examined for generation of neurons in hippocampus and cerebral cortex using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) at 12 weeks. Enriched (EE) and impoverished (PP) groups were housed in their respective environment for 8 weeks, enriched-impoverished (EP) and impoverished-enriched (PE) mice respectively were reared for 6 weeks in the first-mentioned environment and then for 2 weeks in the second. PP and EP mice showed hyperactivity, greater startle amplitude and significantly slower learning in a water maze than EE or PE animals, and also showed a memory deficit in a probe test, avoidance performance did not differ. Neural generation was greater in the EE and PE than PP and EP groups, especially in the hippocampus. These results suggest that environmental change critically affects behavioural and anatomic brain development, even if brief. In these mice, the effect of unfavourable early experience could be reversed by a later short of favourable experience."
"There are few efficacious medications for drug dependence at present. We have previously demonstrated that Leu-Ile, which induces the expression of not only tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) but also glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), inhibits methamphetamine (METH) and morphine (MOR)-induced sensitization and rewarding effects by regulating extracellular dopamine levels via the induction of TNF-alpha expression, and indicated the potential of Leu-Ile as a novel therapeutic agent for METH and MOR-induced dependence. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of GDNF in inhibitory effects of Leu-Ile on MOR-induced sensitization and rewarding effects. Repeated treatment with MOR for 9 days, which results in an enhancement of the locomotor-stimulating effects (sensitization) of MOR, increased GDNF levels in the nucleus accumbens compared with those in saline-treated mice. Repeated pre-treatment with Leu-Ile for 9 days potentiated the MOR-induced increase in GDNF levels. MOR at a low dose (3mg/kg) produced place preference in GDNF heterozygous knockout (GDNF-(+/-)) mice, but not in littermate GDNF-(+/+) mice. No inhibitory effect of Leu-Ile on MOR-induced place preference was observed in GDNF-(+/-) mice. These results suggest that GDNF is involved in the inhibitory effects of Leu-Ile on MOR-induced sensitization and rewarding effects."
"Rats in a runway avoidance task responded to a test shock probe with a period of immobility lasting from 2 to 6s. The shock avoidance-trained group displayed hippocampal theta during the immobility response. The inescapable shock group, in contrast, displayed large amplitude irregular activity (LIA). Following reversal training to escapable shock, all shock avoidance-trained rats responded with LIA and inescapable shock trained rats, reversed to shock avoidance, displayed theta."
"This study examined photoperiodic regulation of affective behaviours in collared lemmings (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus). Male and female lemmings were housed in either long (LD 22:2), intermediate (LD 16:8), or short days (LD 8:16) for 9 weeks. Exposure to short days induced moult to a winter pelage and gonadal regression in male, but not female, lemmings. Lemmings housed in long days reduced anxiety-like responses in the elevated plus maze. Depressive-like behaviours were decreased in the intermediate photoperiod relative to other photoperiod groups."
"The effects of electrical stimulation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) on male rat sexual behaviour were studied. Stimulation of dorsal VTA facilitated copulation of sexually experienced animals; while ventral VTA stimulation inhibited sexual behaviour. In sexually exhausted rats, stimulation at either region lacked of an effect. It is concluded that different loci within the VTA exert opposite influences on male sexual behaviour expression and that copulation to satiation modifies this VTA control."
"This study investigates state-dependent learning employing atropine. The reaction of rats to (1) the presentation of novel stimuli, (2) habituation to intermittent presentations of the same stimulus at the same local, (3) spatial change at the site of stimulus presentation, and (4) a visual stimulus change, was investigated in the straight alleyway test, controlling for the possible development of behavioral and/or pharmacological tolerance. Our findings reveal that rats habituated to stimulus presentation at a specific location, when under an atropine effect, do react to stimulus presentation at another location, or to a different stimulus, when under an atropine effect, indicating that this drug does not interfere with the acquisition of spatial or visual information. Differently, however, rats habituated to stimulus presentation at a specific location in the absence of an atropine effect are unable to react to spatial change when under the atropine effect, but do react to a visual stimulus change. This suggests that atropine interferes either with the retrieval of previously acquired spatial information or with the comparison of previously acquired spatial information with current information, but does not interfere with visual recognition. These findings reveal that atropine interferes with the use of spatial information acquired in the absence of a drug effect."
"Learned irrelevance (LIrr) refers to the retardation of classical conditioning following preexposure of the to-be-associated stimuli. Healthy volunteers have been tested on three occasions with a new LIrr paradigm avoiding methodological problems which afflict traditional paradigms. A significant LIrr effect was demonstrated on each occasion. Thus, the new paradigm enables repeated measurements of LIrr and might be useful in evaluating long-term effects of medication in psychiatric disorders exhibiting aberrant LIrr."
"Selection of an appropriate animal model is a crucial first step in many research programs. The C57BL/6 (B6) mouse is the most widely used inbred mouse strain in biomedical research; this is particularly so in behavioral studies. However, there are several C57BL substrains, all derived from common ancestors. C57BL/10 (B10) mice are superficially almost identical to B6 mice in appearance and behavior and widely used in inflammation and immunology research, yet rarely in behavioral studies. The present study assessed the comparability of behavioral results from these two strains, to determine whether they could be used interchangeably in future behavioral experiments. The results showed that the behavior of B6 mice clearly differed from that of B10 mice: in tests of cognition, species-typical behaviors, and motor coordination the B6 strain performed better. Consequently, B6 mice will probably remain the preferred choice for behavioral studies. Interpretation of results derived from the B10 strain should take into account its particular behavioral characteristics."
"Crying is a universal vocalization in human infants, as well as in the infants of other mammals. Little is known about the neural structures underlying cry production, or the circuitry that mediates a caregiver's response to cry sounds. In this review, the specific structures known or suspected to be involved in this circuit are identified, along with neurochemical systems and hormones for which evidence suggests a role in responding to infants and infant cries. In addition, evidence that crying elicits parental responses in different mammals is presented. An argument is made for including 'crying' as a functional category in the vocal repertoire of all mammalian infants (and the adults of some species). The prevailing neural model for crying production considers forebrain structures to be dispensable. However, evidence for the anterior cingulate gyrus in cry production, and this structure along with the amygdala and some other forebrain areas in responding to cries is presented."
"Olfaction plays a fundamental role in feeding behavior, but changes in olfactory acuity according to feeding states have never been precisely demonstrated in animals. The present study assesses the olfactory detection performance of fasted or satiated rats placed under a strictly controlled food-intake regimen. We did this using a conditioned odor aversion (COA) protocol which induced in rats an almost total aversion to an ISO-odorized drink at 10(-5) (1 microl in 100 ml of water). The rats (either fasted or satiated) were then presented with different concentrations of ISO-odorized water to compare their ability to detect and so avoid the ISO drink. In both states, the rats consumed significantly larger volumes of ISO at 10(-10), 10(-9) and 10(-8) than at 10(-5), suggesting lower detection at these three concentrations, although the fasted rats consumed significantly less ISO drink than did the satiated ones, showing better ISO detection at these concentrations. These experiments provide original data demonstrating the expected fact that olfactory sensitivity increases in fasted animals. Since these results were obtained using a neutral odor, we suggest that olfactory acuity increases during fasting, enabling animals to more easily detect both food and environmental odors such as those of predators. This would have an obvious eco-ethological role by increasing the relevance of olfactory inputs when seeking food."
"Turner syndrome (TS) is a developmental disorder most frequently arising from the loss of a complete X chromosome (karyotype 45,XO). The disorder is characterised by physiological abnormalities (notably short stature and ovarian dysfunction), emotional anomalies (including heightened anxiety) and by a neuropsychological profile encompassing deficits in visuospatial skills, memory, attention, social cognition and emotion recognition. Moreover, TS subjects are at significantly increased risk of developing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism. At the neuroanatomical level, TS subjects display abnormalities across a number of brain structures, including the amygdala, hippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex. The TS phenotype arises due to reduced dosage of X-linked genes, and may also be modulated by parental origin of the single X chromosome. In this review, we discuss the utility of a mouse model of TS, the 39,XO mouse, in which the parental origin of the single X chromosome can be varied. This model provides the opportunity to investigate the effects of X-linked gene dosage/parent-of-origin effects on neurobiology in the absence of gross physiological abnormalities. Initial findings indicate that several features of the TS behavioural phenotype may be accurately recapitulated in the mouse. Furthermore, as X-linked gene dosage/imprinting can influence sex-specific neurobiology, investigations in the 39,XO mouse are also likely to offer insights into why certain neuropsychiatric disorders (including ADHD and autism) affect the sexes differently."
"Somatostatin is a neuropeptide best known for its inhibitory effects on growth hormone secretion and has recently been implicated in the control of social behavior. Several somatostatin receptor subtypes have been identified in vertebrates, but the functional basis for this diversity is still unclear. Here we investigate the expression levels of the somatostatin prepropeptide and two of its receptors, sstR2, and sstR3, in the brains of socially dominant and subordinate Astatotilapia burtoni males using real-time PCR. Dominant males had higher somatostatin prepropeptide and sstR3 expression in hypothalamus compared to subordinate males. Hypothalamic sstR2 expression did not differ. There were no differences in gene expression in the telencephalon. We also observed an interesting difference between dominants and subordinates in the relationship between hypothalamic sstR2 expression and body size. As would be predicted based on the inhibitory effects of somatostatin on somatic growth, sstR2 expression was negatively correlated with body size in dominant males. In contrast sstR2 expression was positively correlated with body size in subordinate males. These results suggest that in A. burtoni social status affects the relationships between somatostatin prepropeptide and receptor gene expression in the hypothalamus and the control of somatic growth."
"Rats make abundant 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) when they play and exhibit other positive social interactions. This response can be dramatically increased by tickling animals, especially when directed toward bodily areas toward which animals direct their own play solicitations (e.g., nape of the neck). The analysis of this system indicates that the response largely occurs in positive, playful social situations, and may index willingness for social engagement, similar to human infantile laughter, which may mature into productive adult socio-sexual behaviors. There are now enough formal similarities between rat 50 kHz USVs and human laughter, to realistically hypothesize that they are neurally and functionally homologous at the subcortical level of brain organization. To help contrast this behavior with human laughter, the available evidence concerning neural organization of human laughter is summarized from brain imaging and neuropsychological perspectives. Thus, a study of 50 kHz USVs in rats may offer an animal model for studying some of the fundamental properties of laughter circuitry in humans, and the brain mechanisms that facilitate positive social engagement, in the mammalian brain. It is proposed that further study of this phenomenon may provide a theoretical as well as empirical handle on the sources of social joy within the mammalian brain."
"Separation and reunion responses have been used to investigate social relationships in many species, including humans. When isolated from their mothers and siblings, infant rats vocalize in the ultrasonic range. An isolated pup reduces its rate of vocalization when placed in contact with familiar stimuli, particularly social ones such as its dam or littermates. The isolated pup's vocalization is greatly increased if the pup has been in contact with its mother immediately before isolation, a phenomenon called maternal potentiation. Early experience can play a role in the acquisition of potentiation. If rat pups are reared by both dam and sire, or even reared by the dam in the presence of the sire's odor, the pups show potentiation to the sire instead of the fear-related behavioral inhibition. Littermates, home cage shavings, and other familiar stimuli from the rearing environment do not elicit increased vocalizations during a subsequent isolation. The neurobiological mechanisms by which the sire becomes capable of potentiating vocalization are unknown, but are hypothesized to depend on the processes underlying development of an odor preference. Expression of potentiation is hypothesized to be related to reward processes in part because dopamine activity plays a regulatory role. Activation of dopamine type 2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens blocks maternal potentiation without altering vocalization rate in an initial isolation. The modulation of isolation-induced vocalization by social interactions provides a paradigm for investigating the neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying acquisition and expression of early life social bonds."
"The effects of chronic ethanol and thiamine deficiency, alone or associated, on hippocampal protein phosphorylation profiles ranging in molecular weight from 30 to 250kDa molecular weight, in stimulated (high K(+) concentration) and unstimulated (basal) conditions were investigated. These treatments significantly changed the phosphorylation level of an 86kDa phosphoprotein. Thiamine deficiency, but not chronic ethanol, induced a decrease in a behavioural extinction index, which is significantly correlated to the phosphorylation level of the p86 protein. These data add to and extend previous findings by our laboratory implicating the involvement of hippocampal neurotransmission components in extinction of a behaviour which involves learning of environmental spatial cues."
"The effect of restraint stress (RS) on neurobehavioral and brain oxidative stress parameters, and their modulation by antioxidants were evaluated in male and cycling female rats. Exposure to RS suppressed both open arm entries and open arm time in the elevated plus maze and these changes were more marked in males than in females. Assay of brain homogenates revealed that the behavioral suppression was associated with similar differential increases in malondialdehye (MDA) and decreases in glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) levels in males and females. Pretreatment with alpha-tocopherol (25 and 50 mg/kg) and N-acetylcysteine (100 and 200 mg/kg), attenuated the stress induced alteration of behavioral and oxidative stress markers in a consistent manner in both male and female rats. These findings suggest that males may be more susceptible than females to stress induced neurobehavioral changes and free radicals may exert a regulatory influence in such gender dependent responses to stress."
"The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of age on women's performance in the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) during total sleep deprivation (SD). A total of 46 healthy women volunteered. They belonged to two age groups: young (n=34; age range 19-30 years; 12 without, and 22 with oral contraceptives (OC); early phase of the menstrual cycle) and older (n=12; age range 60-68; postmenopausal; without hormone therapy). During a 40-h total SD, the subjects performed the PVT and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) at 2-h intervals. At baseline, the reaction speed of the young women was faster as compared to the older women (Mann-Whitney U-test p&lt;0.01). During SD, all the PVT measures as well as the SSS scores changed similarly in the two age groups, when the baseline performance difference in favour of the young women was taken into account (area under curve analyses, Mann-Whitney U-tests n.s.). No age difference in the time course of the SD-related deterioration in PVT performance or subjective sleepiness was observed. OC use had no effects on any of the measures during SD. After recovery sleep, young women had higher subjective sleepiness scores than older women, the sleepiness scores being highest in young women not taking OCs. In conclusion, in women, aging has no effects on the amount or the time course of the decline in PVT performance caused by total SD. OC use does not significantly affect young women's PVT performance during SD in the early phase of the menstrual cycle."
"The sensorimotor speech/voice deficits associated with Parkinson disease have been well documented in humans. They are largely resistant to pharmacological and surgical treatment, but respond to intensive speech therapy. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not well understood and are difficult to systematically test in humans. Thus, we turn to the rat as a model. The purpose of this study is to compare the ultrasonic vocalization (USV) of rats in three conditions: control, haloperidol-induced transient dopamine depletion, and unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced moderately-severe degeneration of dopamine neurons. It was hypothesized that both dopamine-altered conditions would lead to a change in the features of the USV acoustic signal. Results demonstrated that bandwidth decreased in the dopamine-altered rats. This is the first study to document a degradation of the acoustic signal of frequency-modulated 50-kHz calls as a result of interfering with dopamine synaptic transmission in rats. The data suggest that mild transient dopamine depletion with haloperidol or even unilateral degeneration of dopamine neurons is associated with changes in the USV acoustic signal. Dopaminergic dysfunction influences USV quality without reducing the number of calls. This study provides a foundation to examine the role of dopamine in sensorimotor processes underlying USV production and potentially to explore treatments for dopamine deficiency-related impaired vocal outcome."
"An earlier study done by Kas et al. [Kas MJ, van den Bos R, Baars AM, Lubbers M, Lesscher HM, Hillebrand JJ, et al. Mu-opioid receptor knockout mice show diminished food-anticipatory activity. Eur J Neurosci 2004;20(6):1624-32] suggested that mu opioid receptor (MOR) knockout mice have deficits in the motivational component rather than in the information processing component of learning. To substantiate this difference further, MOR knockout mice and wildtype littermates were tested in the Morris Water Maze (MWM), which allows for testing both components of learning. On traditional parameters for performance, no significant differences between genotypes were found. However, swimming velocity, indicative of motivation, decreased for MOR knockout mice during the course of training but not for wildtype mice. In contrast, probe trial performance was comparable between genotypes. Again, these results suggest normal information processing abilities but a decreased motivation in this MOR knockout mouse. Our conclusion is discussed in the light of other studies using MOR knockout mice that do find differences on information processing between genotypes in MWM performance."
"We examined individual differences in sleep and motor activity across 2 consecutive days in rats. EEG and motor activity were recorded via telemetry in Wistar rats (n=29) for 48h under well-habituated conditions. Rats were grouped based on sleep amounts and stability across days (short [SS, n=7], intermediate [IS, n=15] and long [LS, n=7] sleep) and comparisons were conducted to determine group differences for measures of sleep and motor activity. We found that correlations across recording days were significant for all selected sleep measures and motor activity counts. Rankings for 24h total sleep time and non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) were SS&lt;IS&lt;LS rats whereas amounts of rapid eye movement sleep did not differ among groups. Further analyses of NREM episode parameters found significant differences in mean episode length (SS&lt;IS&lt;LS) but not in the number of episodes. Total and average motor activity counts (per waking min) were greater (32-38%) in SS compared to LS rats on both recording days. The results indicate that individual differences in sleep and motor activity in Wistar rats are stable across days. Differences between SS and LS rats have parallels to those reported for short and long sleep humans."
"This study aimed to assess male and female rats' ability to utilize egocentric cues for detecting a change in tactile stimulation encountered in the dark (and possible sex differences). It also investigated the role of mystacial vibrissae in tactile discrimination in this particular setting. Hooded rats of both sexes were accordingly exposed, in the dark, to Y-maze arms with either two rough (sandpaper) or two smooth floors (Perspex), or one rough and one smooth floor. One of the floors was then changed to the opposite type of surface and the rats' ability to locate and explore this changed (or novel) arm in the dark was measured. Both sexes were able to complete this task successfully thereby suggesting that they had used egocentric body cues, rather than visual or olfactory cues for locating the position of the novel arm. Because rats with all their mystacial vibrissae removed were not seriously disadvantaged in locating and exploring the tactually novel arm, it appeared that their ability to discriminate between the tactile properties of the maze arms was not crucially reliant on their whiskers and allied trigeminal system, and may have also involved tactile receptors in their paws. It was concluded that rats of both sexes were able to utilize egocentric cues in detecting a tactile change, and did not rely exclusively on mystacial vibrissae for discriminating between the tactile properties of the maze-arm floors."
"Male Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) treated with moderately high doses (5.0mg/kg/day) of anabolic/androgenic steroids (AAS) during adolescence (P27-P56) display highly escalated offensive aggression. The current study examined whether adolescent AAS-exposure influenced the immunohistochemical localization of phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG), the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of glutamate, a fast-acting neurotransmitter implicated in the modulation of aggression in various species and models of aggression, as well as glutamate receptor 1 subunit (GluR1). Hamsters were administered AAS during adolescence, scored for offensive aggression using the resident-intruder paradigm, and then examined for changes in PAG and GluR1 immunoreactivity in areas of the brain implicated in aggression control. When compared with sesame oil-treated control animals, aggressive AAS-treated hamsters displayed a significant increase in the number of PAG- and area density of GluR1-containing neurons in several notable aggression regions, although the differential pattern of expression did not appear to overlap across brain regions. Together, these results suggest that altered glutamate synthesis and GluR1 receptor expression in specific aggression areas may be involved in adolescent AAS-induced offensive aggression."
"Rats with either no treatment or administration of exogenous basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) received bilateral medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) aspiration or sham lesions at postnatal day 3 (P3). FGF-2 was administered either prenatally at embryonic day 15.5 (PreFGF) or, postnatally (PostFGF) for 7 consecutive days beginning 1 day following surgery. As adults, animals were tested behaviorally at spatial navigation (Morris water task), and skilled reaching (Whishaw tray reaching task). Early lesions of the mPFC produced a significant reduction in both brain weight and cortical thickness in adulthood. Behaviorally, mPFC lesions resulted in deficits in the water maze and reaching task. Both pre- and postnatal FGF-2 facilitated recovery in the spatial navigation task. In contrast, FGF-2 was only effective in reducing the deficits in skilled forelimb movements when the FGF was given postnatal (i.e., postsurgery). Prenatal FGF-2 increased brain weight in the lesion animals, whereas postnatal FGF-2 increased cortical thickness in the lesion animals. It thus appears that FGF-2 can facilitate recovery from perinatal cortical injury, whether it is given during the period of neurogeneration (prenatally) or after the injury, although the mechanism of action is likely different for the pre- and postnatal administration."
"Although systemic allopregnanolone (ALLO; a positive modulator of GABA(A) receptors) has been shown to enhance ethanol-reinforced responding and to modulate drinking patterns in rodents, the effects of centrally administered ALLO on ethanol intake are not known. The current work examined the effects of intracranial ALLO on operant ethanol self-administration in food- and water-satiated mice, with a procedure designed to estimate ALLO's influence on appetitive versus consummatory processes. Male C57BL/6J (B6) mice were trained to press an ethanol-appropriate lever by being reinforced with 30-min of continuous access to a 10% ethanol solution. Following surgical implantation of a guide cannula aimed at the lateral ventricle and subsequent habituation to vehicle infusions, ALLO (50-400 ng; ICV) was delivered immediately prior to session start. ALLO doses of 100 and 400 ng were further evaluated for their effects on locomotor behavior within activity chambers. ALLO selectively modulated ethanol intake patterns associated with the onset and maintenance of self-administration, while leaving appetitive (i.e., ethanol seeking) measures unaltered. The effects of ALLO on drinking patterns were dissociable from changes in locomotor behavior, as evidenced by the absence of ALLO's influence on response frequency and horizontal distance traveled. These findings support the premise that manipulations in brain ALLO levels may influence the regulatory processes governing ethanol consumption."
"The effect of two chronic motor training paradigms on the ability of the lumbar spinal cord to perform an acute instrumental learning task was examined in neonatally (postnatal day 5; P5) spinal cord transected (i.e., spinal) rats. At approximately P30, rats began either unipedal hindlimb stand training (Stand-Tr; 20-25min/day, 5days/week), or bipedal hindlimb step training (Step-Tr; 20min/day; 5days/week) for 7 weeks. Non-trained spinal rats (Non-Tr) served as controls. After 7 weeks all groups were tested on the flexor-biased instrumental learning paradigm. We hypothesized that (1) Step-Tr rats would exhibit an increased capacity to learn the flexor-biased task relative to Non-Tr subjects, as locomotion involves repetitive training of the tibialis anterior (TA), the ankle flexor whose activation is important for successful instrumental learning, and (2) Stand-Tr rats would exhibit a deficit in acute motor learning, as unipedal training activates the ipsilateral ankle extensors, but not flexors. Results showed no differences in acute learning potential between Non-Tr and Step-Tr rats, while the Stand-Tr group showed a reduced capacity to learn the acute task. Further investigation of the Stand-Tr group showed that, while both the ipsilateral and contralateral hindlimbs were significantly impaired in their acute learning potential, the contralateral, untrained hindlimbs exhibited significantly greater learning deficits. These results suggest that different types of chronic peripheral input may have a significant impact on the ability to learn a novel motor task, and demonstrate the potential for experience-dependent plasticity in the spinal cord in the absence of supraspinal connectivity."
"Experimental validation of cell replacement therapy as a treatment of neurodegenerative diseases requires the demonstration of graft-mediated behavioural recovery. The Corridor task proved to be simple and efficient to conduct with a robust ipsilateral retrieval bias in our rodent Huntington's disease model. The Corridor task is a viable behavioural option, particularly to non-specialised laboratories, for the evaluation of lateralised striatal damage and the probing of alternative therapeutic strategies, including transplantation."
"The reconsolidation hypothesis, which predicts that consolidated memories become labile and sensitive to amnestic agents upon reactivation, has been one of the most debated topics in memory research over recent years. One of the main criticisms to this hypothesis is the fact that some studies have shown the effects of ""reconsolidation blockade"" to be transient. Here we show that muscimol inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus following memory reactivation produces a reversible impairment of step-down inhibitory avoidance memory in rats. Moreover, we show that the reversal of this effect is dependent on the passage of time, and not on repeated testing. The implications of the findings to the interpretation of the phenomenon of transient retrieval impairment induced by post-reactivation pharmacological interventions on memory systems are discussed."
"Inattention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness are the main symptoms of the heterogeneous attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It has been suggested that ADHD is associated with an imbalance in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition, with abnormal low levels of the main n-3 PUFA, DHA (22: 6n-3). DHA is highly accumulated in nervous tissue membranes and is implicated in neural function. Animal studies have shown that diet-induced lack of DHA in the brain leads to alterations in cognitive processes, but the relationship between DHA and hyperactivity is unclear. We examined the membrane phospholipid fatty acid profile in frontal cortex of rats characterized for attention, impulsiveness and motricity in various environmental contexts to determine the relationship between brain PUFA composition and the symptoms of ADHD. The amounts of n-3 PUFA in the PE were significantly correlated with nocturnal locomotor activity and the locomotor response to novelty: hyperactive individuals had less n-3 PUFA than hypoactive ones. We conclude that spontaneous hyperactivity in rats is the symptom of ADHD that best predicts the n-3 PUFA content of the frontal cortex. This differential model in rats should help to better understand the role of PUFA in several psychopathologies in which PUFA composition is modified."
"The hindpaw withdrawal latencies (HWLs) to noxious thermal and mechanical stimulation increased significantly after intra-hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) injection of galanin in mononeuropathic rats, while intra-ARC injection of the putative antagonist of galanin receptors markedly reduced the HWLs. The number of galaninergic neurons in the ARC increased in rats with mononeuropathy than that in normal rats. The results demonstrated that both endogenous and exogenous galanin were involved in the regulation of nociception in the ARC of rats with peripheral nerve injury."
"Learning and memory impairments associated with diabetes have been reproduced in rodent models of diabetes type I, but few studies have been performed in spontaneously type II diabetic rodents. The study of type II diabetic rats such as the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat is of advantage when characterizing the development of cognitive impairments specifically caused by the progression of the disease and not by its treatment. We thus hypothesized that GK rats might display learning impairments when compared to non-diabetic Wistar rats. In the present study, we employed a lever-press task, a behavioural paradigm which allows the study of response-reinforcement learning, discrimination of a rewarding lever (using a two-choice positional discrimination task), and the ability to increase operant behaviour when requirements for reward increase (using a progressive ratio [PR]). In parallel, locomotor activity was compared between strains to assess exploratory activity and behavioural habituation to a novel environment. Diabetic GK rats made significantly less lever-presses with increasing fixed ratios and, throughout the sessions, a trend for increased selection errors was observed in these animals. In addition, a significant reduction in the maximum number of lever-presses made by GK rats was observed during the PR sessions. Locomotor activity of GK rats was higher on the first day of exploration but significantly decreased with familiarization to the environment. The present results suggest that the diabetic-like symptomatology in GK rats led to a reduction of exploratory activity and of lever-pressing during fixed and progressive ratio schedules, likely caused by learning impairments."
"Nociceptive stimulation, at an intensity that elicits pain-related behavior, attenuates recovery of locomotor and bladder functions, and increases tissue loss after a contusion injury. These data imply that nociceptive input (e.g., from tissue damage) can enhance the loss of function after injury, and that potential clinical treatments, such as pretreatment with an analgesic, may protect the damaged system from further secondary injury. The current study examined this hypothesis and showed that a potential treatment (morphine) did not have a protective effect. In fact, morphine appeared to exacerbate the effects of nociceptive stimulation. Experiment 1 showed that after spinal cord injury 20mg/kg of systemic morphine was necessary to induce strong antinociception and block behavioral reactivity to shock treatment, a dose that was much higher than that needed for sham controls. In Experiment 2, contused rats were given one of three doses of morphine (Vehicle, 10, 20mg/kg) prior to exposure to uncontrollable electrical stimulation or restraint alone. Despite decreasing nociceptive reactivity, morphine did not attenuate the long-term consequences of shock. Rats treated with morphine and shock had higher mortality rates, and displayed allodynic responses to innocuous sensory stimuli three weeks later. Independent of shock, morphine per se undermined recovery of sensory function. Rats treated with morphine alone also had significantly larger lesions than those treated with saline. These results suggest that nociceptive stimulation affects recovery despite a blockade of pain-elicited behavior. The results are clinically important because they suggest that opiate treatment may adversely affect the recovery of function after injury."
"Sleep spindles and rapid eye movements have been found to increase following an intense period of learning on a combination of procedural memory tasks. It is not clear whether these changes are task specific, or the result of learning in general. The current study investigated changes in spindles, rapid eye movements, K-complexes and EEG spectral power following learning in good sleepers randomly assigned to one of four learning conditions: Pursuit Rotor (n=9), Mirror Tracing (n=9), Paired Associates (n=9), and non-learning controls (n=9). Following Pursuit Rotor learning, there was an increase in the duration of Stage 2 sleep, spindle density (number of spindles/min), average spindle duration, and an increase in low frequency sigma power (12-14Hz) at occipital regions during SWS and at frontal regions during Stage 2 sleep in the second half of the night. These findings are consistent with previous findings that Pursuit Rotor learning is consolidated during Stage 2 sleep, and provide additional data to suggest that spindles across all non-REM stages may be a mechanism for brain plasticity. Following Paired Associates learning, theta power increased significantly at central regions during REM sleep. This study provides the first evidence that REM sleep theta activity is involved in declarative memory consolidation. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that brain plasticity during sleep does not involve a unitary process; that is, different types of learning have unique sleep-related memory consolidation mechanisms that act in dissociable brain regions at different times throughout the night."
"The object location task is a new procedure evaluating spatial memory abilities in the rat. The aim of the present study was to characterize this behavioural paradigm by pharmacologic means. For this purpose, the effects of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine and the inhibitor of the nitric oxide synthase L-NAME on object location were assessed in the rat. In a first study, object location was impaired when the delay condition of 60-min was utilized. Subsequently, pre-training administration of scopolamine (0.2 mg/kg but not 0.07 mg/kg) induced delay-dependent performance deficits in this test. These impairments seem to be centrally mediated since the peripheral muscarinic receptor antagonist methylscopolamine (0.2 mg/kg) did not affect object location under the same conditions. Finally, pre-training treatment with L-NAME (30 mg/kg but not 10 mg/kg) also induced delay-dependent performance deficits in the object location task. These results indicate that the object location test is sensitive to pharmacological treatment and could be used for assessing the therapeutic potential of promnesic compounds."
"Maternal behavior is induced in virgin female rabbits (normally unresponsive to foster pups) by removing the accessory olfactory bulbs. To determine if the main olfactory system (MOS) plays a similar inhibitory role in the present work we investigated the effect of lesioning the olfactory epithelium with a ZnSO(4) spray on the facilitation of maternal behavior in New Zealand white virgin rabbits. Four days after the chemical lesion 40% of females showed behaviors indistinguishable from those of normal mothers, i.e.: rapid entrance into the nest box containing the pups, adoption of a crouching posture over them, acceptance of suckling, and exit from the nest box after ca. 3min. The proportion of females showing these behaviors rose to 70% by day 14 post-lesion. Ovariectomized rabbits sprayed with ZnSO(4) or animals sprayed with NaCl did not behave maternally. ZnSO(4) also provoked a transient reduction in olfactory perception: before the lesion animals from all groups directed significantly more sniffs to a flask containing male urine than to one containing water. This difference was abolished in ZnSO(4)-sprayed females (intact and ovariectomized) for 3-6 days post-lesion and was re-established by 7-9 days. NaCl did not provoke such transitory hyposmia. ZnSO(4) lesions did not provoke malaise in the animals, as determined by food intake and the frequency of scent-marking and ambulation. Results suggest that olfactory cues from the pups are aversive to virgin rabbits and that a transitory reduction in their perception (accompanied by the action of ovarian secretions) is enough to facilitate maternal responsiveness."
"The olfactory information processing abilities of children undergo changes during early life. The aims of the present study were to describe these changes and to probe for their electrophysiological correlates. These aims were investigated in two experiments. In Experiment 1, responses of 146 subjects (3-12 years) were tested with psychophysical tools. Approximately 2/3 of the subjects completed the olfactory tests (""Sniffin' Sticks""). In Experiment 2, 12 additional subjects (3-10 years) were tested with electrophysiological tools. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in response to olfactory stimulation with H(2)S. Results from Experiment 1 indicated that data from the group of 3-5-year olds were very unreliable, with 44% of incomplete measures rendering the tests unsuitable for routine use with 3-5-year olds. From an age of 6 years on the results suggested that the development of olfactory function was well advanced with a significant increase found only for odor identification, but not for odor thresholds, or odor discrimination. Results from Experiment 2 indicated an increase of the P2 latency with age, although the small sample size has to be considered in the interpretation of these data. While more research is needed, these results may be interpreted such that children attach more meaning to odorous stimuli with age."
"Peroxynitrite (ONOO(-))-mediated damage is regarded to be responsible for the cognitive dysfunction induced by amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we examined the protective effects of rosmarinic acid (RA), a natural scavenger of ONOO(-), on the memory impairment in a mouse model induced by acute i.c.v. injection of Abeta(25-35). Mice daily received i.p. several doses of RA after the injection of Abeta(25-35). RA prevented the memory impairments induced by Abeta(25-35) in the Y maze test and novel object recognition task. RA, at the effective lowest dose (0.25mg/kg), prevented Abeta(25-35)-induced nitration of proteins, an indirect indicator of ONOO(-) damage, in the hippocampus. At this dose, RA also prevented nitration of proteins and impairment of recognition memory induced by ONOO(-)-i.c.v.-injection. Co-injection of the non-memory-impairing dose of ONOO(-) with Abeta(25-35) blocked the protective effects of RA (0.25mg/kg). These results demonstrated that the memory protective effects of RA in the neurotoxicity of Abeta(25-35) is due to its scavenging of ONOO(-), and that daily consumption of RA may protect against memory impairments observed in AD."
"In the present study, we investigated the involvement of prefrontal glutamatergic neurotransmission in the enhancement of immobility (emotional deficit) in a forced swimming test in mice treated with phencyclidine (PCP: 10mg/kg/day for 14 days) repeatedly, which is regarded as an animal model for negative symptoms. A decrease in spontaneous extracellular glutamate release and increase in levels of the glutamate transporter GLAST, were observed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of PCP-treated mice, compared to saline-treated mice. NMDA receptor subunit 1 (NR1) and Ca(2+)/calmoduline kinase II (CaMKII) were markedly activated in the PFC of saline-treated mice, but not PCP-treated mice, immediately after the forced swimming test. The facilitation of the function of NMDA receptors by d-cycloserine (30mg/kg i.p.), an NMDA receptor glycine-site partial agonist, reversed the enhancement of immobility in the forced swimming test and impairment of CaMKII activation in the PCP-treated mice. Microinjection of dl-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate (10nmol/site/bilaterally), a potent blocker of glutamate transporters, into the PFC of PCP-treated mice also had an attenuating effect. In addition, activation of glial cells and a decrease of neuronal cell size were observed in the PFC of PCP-treated mice. These results suggest that repeated PCP treatment disrupts pre- and post-synaptic glutamatergic neurotransmission and induces morphological changes in the PFC and that such changes cause the emotional deficits exhibited in PCP-treated mice."
"Adult rats produce two distinct types of ultrasonic vocalizations referred to as 22- and 50-kHz calls, respectively. Emission of the respective calls represents signaling a negative or positive state of the rat organism. The signaling has an adaptive value for survival and/or well-being of rats and their social groups. Literature is reviewed from studies on cats and rats, which indicates that the positive or negative states constitute a complex and integrated set of somatic, autonomic, endocrine, affective, and cognitive correlates. The basic states and their correlates are initiated, integrated, and maintained by activity of the subsets of the ascending cholinergic and dopaminergic systems originating from the reticular brainstem core. The cholinergic and dopaminergic systems interact mutually to form a dynamic balance, which is involved in a decision-making process of initiating and maintaining one or the other of these states. Activation of the relevant portion of the ascending cholinergic system invariably induces the negative state and releases 22-kHz calls while activation of the ascending dopaminergic system induces the positive state with 50-kHz calls. The 22- and 50-kHz calls have distinct and mostly non-overlapping acoustic parameters, which ensure unambiguous recognition of the calls and thus, the state of the emitter. The animal may only signal one of the states at any given time and emission of 22- or 50-kHz calls is mutually exclusive. It is postulated, therefore, that these two main types of ultrasonic calls are reliable indicator variables of two opposing states of the adult rat organism: negative or positive."
"Obese individuals often suffer from depression. The olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) model is an animal model of depression that produces behavioral, physiological, and neurochemical alterations resembling clinical depression. The OBX model was employed to assess depression-related changes in food intake in obesity-prone, Osborne-Mendel (OM) rats and obesity-resistant, S5B/Pl rats. OBX increased food intake in OM rats beginning 7 days following surgery, however, OBX did not alter food intake in S5B/Pl rats at any time point. Fourteen days following surgery, OBX significantly increased locomotor activity (total lines crossed and rears) in the openfield test in OM and S5B/Pl rats. Fifteen days following surgery, prepro-neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA levels were significantly increased in the hypothalamus of bulbectomized OM rats and in the medial nucleus of the amygdala of bulbectomized OM and S5B/Pl rats. OBX decreased NPY Y2 receptor mRNA levels in the hypothalamus and medial nucleus of the amygdala in OM rats, while increasing NPY Y2 receptor mRNA levels in the medial nucleus of the amygdala of S5B/Pl rats. These data indicate that though both obesity-prone and obesity-resistant strains were susceptible to the locomotor effects of OBX, food intake and hypothalamic prepro-NPY mRNA were only increased in OM rats. Therefore, strain specific alterations in hypothalamic NPY may account for increased food intake in the obesity-prone rats following OBX, and suggests a potential mechanism to explain the comorbidity of obesity and depression."
"Recently, it has been reported that mice deficient for Dexras1 have a diminished phase-shifting response to photic stimuli but an enhanced response to non-photic stimuli; the latter is of additional interest in that mice generally show relatively weak and unreliable responses to non-photic events. Therefore, in situations in which both photic and non-photic stimuli are present, control of circadian rhythms, relative to wild-types, should tip toward non-photic stimuli in Dexras1(-/-) mice. However, we detected no differences in an experiment in which photic and non-photic entraining agents were presented 180 degrees out of phase, i.e. were in conflict with each other. Furthermore, Dexras1(-/-) and wild-type mice did not differ in non-photic phase shifting to a pulse of confinement in a novel running wheel. Suppression of locomotion by light (masking effect) did not differ between the genotypes, indicating that the photoreceptor input to the non-image forming system is intact. The circadian phenotype of Dexras1(-/-) mice appears to be more complicated than previously thought."
"Recent studies have reported an age-related increase of anxiety in rodents with a concomitant decrease in neuronal activity in some of the key structures of the fear/anxiety circuit. In the present study we present evidence that distinct parts of this circuit are differentially affected by age in Lewis rats. The effect of ageing is observed both at the actual level of neuronal activation and its time-course. While the structures belonging to the HPA axis react with a bigger neuronal activation and almost no change in the shape of dynamics curve in response to restraint, the structures involved in higher processing of emotional cues (amygdala and hippocampus) become deficiently activated with age despite their generally higher basal level of activation."
"Rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) as social signals in several situations. Lesion studies have shown that rat perirhinal cortex (PR), a polymodal sensory region that is reciprocally connected with the amygdala, is critical for normal fear conditioning to so-called ""22 kHz USVs"". Here we evaluated single-unit responses in rat PR to 22 kHz USVs and other acoustic stimuli. One question was whether PR circuits are specifically and preferentially tuned, prior to fear conditioning, to respond to USVs and USV-like stimuli. Two 22 kHz USVs were pre-recorded from different conspecifics. Each USV consisted of a ""bout"" of several discrete calls. Using experimentally na&#xef;ve rats, single-unit responses to the USVs were compared with responses to continuous or discontinuous tones that had the same root frequency as the USVs (19 or 22 kHz). The on/off patterns of the discontinuous tones were temporally matched to the call structure in the corresponding USVs. Compared to continuous tones, the USVs were no more likely to elicit single-unit firing changes in PR. On the other hand, the continuous tones and USVs clearly did elicit different firing patterns in many units. More specifically, the USVs sometimes elicited a transient increase in discharge frequency to each call in a bout of calls. Interestingly, the USVs and the temporally matched tone segments usually elicited similar firing patterns. The USV-elicited firing pattern in PR thus appears to be controlled by the on/off temporal structure of the calls rather than by the frequency or amplitude modulations associated with each call in a bout of calls."
"We tested the effect of weaning at 21 or 30 days, followed by individual or group housing, on explorative and social behavior in adult male and female rats, and in males, on dendritic length and spine density in prefrontal cortex. In the open field, rats weaned early were the most active, while those weaned late and group housed were the most explorative. In the social interaction test, behavior in adult females was relatively impervious to weaning age or rearing condition. Isolated males sought out social interaction, whereas, group-reared males tended to avoid it. Social behaviors in males weaned early or group-reared correlated with decreased dendrite length and spine density, whereas, non-social behaviors correlated with increased dendritic length. Such changes are consistent with neural pruning in the development of social behavior. Although our experimental manipulations were mild, and serve as standard rearing conditions in many laboratories, their effects on brain and behavior were marked, and differed by gender. Early rearing conditions may have few appreciable effects when studied in isolation, but their interactive effects on adult social behavior are significant and varied."
"We investigated age-related changes in learning and memory performance and behavioural extinction in the water maze; and in endogenous levels of serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) in the neocortex, hippocampus, thalamus and dorsal raphe nucleus of Wistar rats. Another aim was to assess the correlation between behavioural and biochemical parameters, which were measured in rodents of two different ages: 5 months (adults) and 16 months (middle-aged). The middle-aged subjects succeeded in learning the behavioural task, albeit with significantly worse performance when compared to adult animals. Aging also had significant main effects on memory and extinction. An age-dependent decrease in 5-HIAA levels was observed in both hippocampus and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). The decrease in DRN 5-HIAA was paralleled by a decrease in 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in this brain area, which was significantly correlated to the animals' spatial memory performance and behavioural extinction. In addition, using middle-aged rats, a 2x2 factorial study was carried out to examine the effects of food restriction and chronic ethanol consumption on rat's performance in a spatial behavioural task and on central serotonergic parameters. None of these two treatments had a significant effect on the behavioural and biochemical parameters assessed, with the exception of extinction index, which was significantly affected by ethanol consumption. Long-term ethanol ameliorated the impairment in behavioural flexibility caused by aging. In conclusion, long-term ethanol consumption may have a role in protecting against age-related deficit in behavioural extinction. Moreover, the present results also indicate that DRN serotonergic system is involved in spatial memory and behavioural extinction."
"Mice self-administer morphine into the lateral septum (LS), but the neuronal connections underlying this behaviour remain unknown. The present study tested whether the acquisition of intra-LS morphine self-administration depends on dopaminergic mechanisms. Mice were allowed to self-inject morphine (5 or 20ng/50nl) or vehicle directly into the LS using a spatial discrimination Y-maze task. Fos imaging was used to evaluate neuronal activation in cerebral structures directly connected to the LS or belonging to the dopaminergic system. The involvement of dopaminergic and opioidergic mechanisms was assessed by pre-treating naive mice peripherally with the D1 antagonist SCH23390, the D2/D3 antagonist sulpiride or the opiate antagonist naloxone before daily self-administration sessions. Mice acquired self-administration behaviour for intra-LS morphine that was associated with increased Fos expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), dorsal and ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex. Pre-treating animals with naloxone, SCH23390 or sulpiride completely prevented them from acquiring intra-LS morphine self-administration. All three antagonists consistently blocked Fos expression in the prefrontal cortex, but not in the VTA and striatum. Taken together, our results show that morphine self-administration into the LS depends on dopaminergic (D1 and D2/D3) and opioidergic mechanisms. Furthermore, they suggest that opioid peptides released in the LS could participate in regulating the activity of mesotegmental dopaminergic neurons."
Naming and localization of individual body part words to a high-resolution line drawing of a full human figure was tested in a mixed-sex sample of nine right handed subjects. Activation within the superior medial left parietal cortex and bilateral dorsolateral cortex was consistent with involvement of the body schema which is a dynamic postural self-representation coding and combining sensory afference and motor efference inputs/outputs that is automatic and nonconscious. Additional activation of the left rostral occipitotemporal cortex was consistent with involvement of the neural correlates of the verbalizable body structural description that encodes semantic and categorical representations to animate objects such as full human figures. The results point to a highly distributed cortical representation for the encoding and manipulation of body part information and highlight the need for the incorporation of more ecologically valid measures of body schema coding in future functional neuroimaging studies.
"We have already demonstrated that pretreatment of adult rats with a 48-h-long ""repetitive non-reinforced sound exposure (SE)"" improves performance in two-sound discriminative operant conditioning (sound exposure-modulated discrimination [SED]). This three-part study addressed the neural basis of SED by parametrically analyzing SED: effects of the SE using various sound signals were compared during the performance of a sound-discrimination task. Experiment 1 provided evidence that SED was due to the improvement of auditory perceptual capacity rather than due to a change in motivation or attention or interference with association process. Results of Experiment 2 made it likely that SED took place mainly in higher cortical auditory fields, which potentially integrate acoustic information beyond the cochleotopy. Results of Experiment 3 favored the idea that SED was based on a stimulus-specific decrease rather than a stimulus-specific increase in the responsivity of the auditory system. Collectively, it is suggested that auditory habituation plays an important role in SED, i.e., a certain form of auditory perceptual learning."
"We recently reported that chronic lithium (LiCl), at therapeutic plasma levels, enhanced spatial working memory and retention of an aversive contingency. Here we examine the possibility that these effects be secondary to LiCl effects on the ability to ignore irrelevant stimuli or on fear conditioning. In Experiment 1, rats subjected to &gt;30 daily intraperitoneal injections of LiCl (2mmol/kg) or saline underwent conditioned emotional response training (CER: 2 CS pairings with 1-s, 1-mA shock) after 40 pre-exposures either to the CS (latent inhibition-LiCl/latent inhibition-saline, n=8) or to another stimulus (control-LiCl/control-saline, n=8). In Experiment 2, eight LiCl and eight saline animals were trained in on-the-baseline (VI-60s) CER (1-s, 0.15-mA shock in CS-signalled periods) in the Skinner box. In Experiment 1, LiCl animals showed normal latent inhibition. In both experiments, their fear conditioning was unimpaired. Therefore, the previously reported memory improvement under chronic lithium cannot be attributed to changes in the ability to ignore irrelevant stimuli or in fear conditioning."
"One of the most established hypotheses of depression focuses on alteration of the serotonergic (5-HT) function. Recent evidence suggests that serotonergic involvement in depression may be modulated by the action of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GABA). Furthermore, altered GABAergic function is also evident in depressed patients and in animal models of depression. Disturbed sleep is characteristic of patients with mood disorders. The most pronounced changes of the 5-HT firing activity occur during sleep. Hence, the present paper reports a study on simultaneously measurement of hippocampal levels of serotonin and GABA during waking and sleep in the chronic mild stress (CMS) animal model of depression. The neurotransmitter findings are accompanied by depression-like symptoms (e.g. sleep alterations and reduced sucrose intake, a putative indicator of anhedonia in rodents). Our results show that animals exposed to CMS had lower hippocampal GABA levels compared to controls. In addition, after CMS there was a lack of 5-HT stage-dependency. A subgroup (five out of eight animals) showed a consistent increase in 5-HT levels in slow wave sleep and REM sleep. We also observed that this increase occurred in those animals regarded as most anhedonic (lowest intake of sucrose solution). Moreover, REM sleep was positively correlated with anhedonia. No interaction between 5-HT and GABA was found in the hippocampus. The data suggest that both GABAergic and serotonergic systems may be simultaneously but independently involved in depression. The alteration in 5-HT function may represent a link between depression-like behaviour and sleep abnormalities found in depressed patients."
"In the present study, the effect of repeated administration of morphine into the ventral pallidum (intra-VP) on the conditioned place preference (CPP) induced by systemic morphine injection was investigated in male Wistar rats. Subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of morphine (2.5, 5 and 7.5mg/kg), during conditioning, induced conditioned place preference (CPP). The maximum response was obtained with 5mg/kg of morphine. Lower dose of morphine (0.5mg/kg) did not induce CPP, but in the animals which had previously, received 3 days intra-VP repeated injections of morphine (3 or 5microg/rat) followed by 5 days free of the drug, elicited a significant CPP. Moreover, 3 days intraperitoneal (i.p.) pretreatment with different doses of naloxone (0.5, 1 and 2mg/kg), SCH 23390 (0.012, 0.025 and 0.05mg/kg) or sulpiride (6.2, 12.5 and 25mg/kg) in combination with repeated injections of morphine (5microg/rat), blocked the opioid response on the acquisition of morphine (0.5mg/kg) CPP. On the other hand, our results showed that 3 days single repeated administration of different doses of naloxone (0.5, 1 or 2mg/kg, i.p.), SCH 23390 but not sulpiride followed by 5 days free of the drug, significantly decreased the acquisition of morphine (0.5mg/kg) CPP and also induced place aversion. Furthermore, the drugs' injections had no effect on locomotor activity on the testing phase of CPP. It is concluded that repeated intra-VP injections of morphine induces behavioral sensitization, which may be due to the opioidrgic and/or dopaminergic mechanism(s)."
"Gene expression profiles in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) of adult Long-Evans rats as a function of a stressful social defeat in inter-male fighting encounters were examined. This social subordination model mimics prototypical behavioral changes that parallel aspects of clinical depression, has been postulated to simulate early changes in the onset of depression in the losers, and has been successfully utilized for the evaluation of antidepressant activity. The 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) have been shown to reflect negative emotional states akin to anxiety and depression. Social defeat is the most robust and reliable method of eliciting these calls. The PAG has been shown to be a key brain region for the generation of 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations, and 22-kHz USVs have been shown to be controlled by the mesolimbic cholinergic system. In this present study, we examined gene expression changes in the PAG of social subordinate rats compared to dominant rats that do not Exhibit 22-kHz USVs. We found that social defeat significantly altered the genes associated with cholinergic synaptic transmission in the PAG. The most robust of these were the increased expression of the beta2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRNB2) and the T subunit of acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) in the subordinate animals. These changes were corroborated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and found to be exclusive to the PAG compared to seven other brain regions examined. These data suggest that cholinergic transmission in the PAG is involved in the generation of 22-kHz USVs and provide potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of affective disorders."
"This study provides the first description of neural network dynamics associated with response inhibition in healthy adolescents and adults. Functional and effective connectivity analyses of whole brain hemodynamic activity elicited during performance of a Go/No-Go task were used to identify functionally integrated neural networks and characterize their causal interactions. Three response inhibition circuits formed a hierarchical, inter-dependent system wherein thalamic modulation of input to premotor cortex by fronto-striatal regions led to response suppression. Adolescents differed from adults in the degree of network engagement, regional fronto-striatal-thalamic connectivity, and network dynamics. We identify and characterize several age-related differences in the function of neural circuits that are associated with behavioral performance changes across adolescent development."
"SGS742 has been reported to increase spatial memory in rodents. However, effects of SGS742 have not been systematically assessed in different strains so far and indeed strains show different cognitive abilities per se. The aim of the study was therefore to examine the effect of SGS742 in three different inbred (C57BL/6J, DBA/2, BALB/c) strains and three outbred strains (CD1, CF1, OF1). Mice were administered intra-peritonial (3-aminopropyl)n-butylphosphinic acid (SGS742; GABA (B)-receptor antagonist) and tested in the Morris water maze (MWM). Open field, elevated plus maze, neurological observational battery and rota rod were carried out to support interpretation of data. SGS742 enhanced performance in the MWM in an inbred strain, C57BL/6J and in the outbred strain OF1 in terms of learning and memory formation at the consolidation level. A series of side effects as e.g. reduced motor coordination and proprioception were noticed that, however, may not have been influencing results observed in the cognition task. In conclusion, SGS742 enhanced cognitive performance in two mouse strains and we learned that testing compounds for effects on spatial memory should be carried out in several strains or even different species in order to claim cognitive enhancement."
"Individual lesions of the caudal (E1) or rostral (E2) ventral tuberomammillary nuclei induced hyperphagia in Wistar rats. The aim of the present study was to examine the additive or united effects of combined lesions of E1+E2 in food intake. E1+E2 lesions produced an immediate, potent and permanent hyperphagic response that was greater than that observed in groups with individual lesions (E1 or E2) during the 22-day observation period. Furthermore, at the end of this period (Days 17/22), the combined lesions induced a greater increase in body weight compared with groups with individual lesions. As previously reported, polydipsia is also induced by lesions of the ventral tuberomammillary subnuclei. However, in this case, responses of the individual polydipsic groups did not differ from those found in the E1+E2 ventral tuberomammillary group. These results are interpreted in terms of the hypothalamic systems involved in food and water intake."
"The behavioral sensitization produced by repeated amphetamine treatment may represent the neural adaptations underlying some of the features of psychosis and addiction in humans. Chromatin modification (specifically histone hyperacetylation) was recently recognized as an important regulator of psychostimulant-induced plasticity. We have investigated the effects of treatment with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors butyric acid (BA, 630mg/kg, i.p.) and valproic acid (VPA, 175mg/kg, i.p.) on the psyhcostimulant locomotor sensitization induced by amphetamine (AMPH, 2.0mg/kg, i.p.). Neither BA nor VPA had locomotor effects alone, but both significantly potentiated the amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization in mice. At the molecular level, VPA and amphetamine produced an increase of histone H4 acetylation in the striatum as detected by Western blot analysis, while co-treatment with VPA and AMPH produced an additive effect on histone H4 acetylation. We then administered the HDAC inhibitors after treatment with amphetamine for 8 days to establish locomotor sensitization. We found that repeated administration of VPA or BA for 6 days inhibited the expression of sensitized response following amphetamine challenge. Finally, in a context-specific model we studied the effect of HDAC inhibitors on amphetamine-induced association of the treatment environment (associative learning). We found that VPA and BA enhance the context-specificity of expression of amphetamine sensitization. Thus, HDAC inhibitors differentially modulate the induction and expression of amphetamine-induced effects. Together, these results suggest that dynamic changes in chromatin modification may be an important mechanism underlying amphetamine-induced neuronal plasticity and associative learning."
"This experiment aimed to examine the role of the CB1 and Opioid mu receptors on fat preference by administering the CB1 inverse agonist AM 251 (5mg/kg i.p.) and the opioid mu antagonist beta-Funaltrexamine (15mg/kg s.c.) for 4 days to fat-preferring C57BL/6 mice fed a two-choice high-fat/low-fat diet. Both drugs were found to significantly reduce total energy intake, high-fat diet intake and fat preference during treatment."
"This study examined the effect of both separate and combined depletion of brain somatostatin and serotonin on acquisition of the water maze (WM) task. Na&#xef;ve male Long-Evans rats received injections of p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA; 500mg/kgx2) to deplete serotonin or cysteamine (90 or 200mg/kg) to deplete somatostatin, or both treatments prior to spatial and reversal training in the water maze. Some rats first received Morris' nonspatial pretraining to train them in the behavioral strategies that are required for successful spatial place learning in this task, prior to drug treatment and spatial training. A detailed behavioral analysis indicated that somatostatin or serotonin depletion alone caused little or no impairment in na&#xef;ve animals. Depletion of both somatostatin and serotonin in na&#xef;ve rats impaired performance, with differences in the impairments that depended on the dose of cysteamine. Nonspatially pretrained rats were not impaired. Thus, neither somatostatin nor serotonin alone is crucial for the water maze task, but impairments occur if both somatostatin and serotonin are depleted in na&#xef;ve rats. The results indicate that some of the performance impairment was due to strategies impairment rather than a spatial place learning impairment. Depletion of both somatostatin and serotonin in na&#xef;ve rats produces results comparable to the spatial navigation deficits seen in some Alzheimer patients and suggests that combinations of antagonist treatments may better model this disorder than single antagonist treatments do."
"We report four experiments aimed at characterising the role played by the encoding of the spatial relationship between stimulus parts in pattern recognition in capuchin monkeys, as assessed by a matching to sample task. The results of the first experiment, which were also reliably replicated at different stages in the course of the study, indicated that the simultaneous rotation and/or translation of the four parts into which the stimuli were divided, but not a global rotation of the entire stimulus, impaired matching performance in capuchin monkeys. Experiments two and three showed that matching performance was not impaired following similar manipulations of a subset of one, two or three parts. In experiment four, the same task was presented to human subjects. The same pattern of results emerged for humans and monkeys in trials where all the four stimulus parts were presented. However, the matching performance of humans was affected more than that of capuchin monkeys when only a subset of stimulus parts was featured in the task. These results support the conclusion that the matching performance of capuchin monkeys is affected by the rearrangement of stimulus parts and, as such it seems to rely on global properties of the stimulus such as the spatial relationships of the component parts. However, the remarkable ability of capuchin monkeys to identify a stimulus on the basis of a subset of parts suggests that the reliance on the global properties of the stimuli may not be pervasive as it is in humans."
"Behavioral responses to thermal and mechanical stimuli were used to examine somatic sensitivity in rats with stereotaxic corticosterone (CORT) implants on the amygdala. These animals have previously been shown to display anxiety-like behavior coupled with colonic hypersensitivity; in this study, CORT induced not only visceral hypersensitivity but also somatic hypersensitivity. These findings suggest that modulation of the amygdala with CORT results in a generalized decrease in sensory thresholds via descending neuronal pathways."
"Rodent models provide a valuable approach to elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the deleterious effects of childhood trauma and stress. Neonatal rats and mice emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) when separated from the dam and litter. USVs are suppressed in rat pups by exposure to the putatively infanticidal threat of an adult male. In the present study, C57BL/6J mouse pups were exposed to an anaesthetized (non-sire) adult C57BL/6J male for 3-min/day from postnatal days 2-14, and subsequently tested for anxiety-related behaviors (using the novel open field, elevated plus-maze, light/dark exploration tests) and depression-related behavior (using the forced swim test) at 11 weeks of age. In a separate cohort, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis activation was measured via plasma corticosterone levels following either a single male-exposure or separation episode. Results showed that pups exposed to an adult male emitted significantly fewer USVs than separation-only counterparts. Corticosterone levels were significantly lower following single exposure to the adult male than separation alone. Repeated neonatal male-exposure did not lead to significant alterations in anxiety- or depression-related behaviors in adulthood. Taken together, present data suggest that the form of adult male-exposure employed did not act as a significant stressor, at least in this mouse strain. Further studies will be needed to determine whether alternative mouse strains, exposure protocols or adult behavioral assays will produce a different pattern of short-term and long-term effects."
"The GABA(B) receptor is a heterodimer of GABA(B(1)) and GABA(B(2)) subunits. There are two isoforms of the GABA(B(1)) subunit: GABA(B(1a)) and GABA(B(1b)). Recent studies with mutant mice suggest a differential role for the two GABA(B(1)) isoforms in behavioural processes. As pharmacological and genetic studies have implicated GABA(B) receptors in cognition we investigated the behaviour of GABA(B(1a))(-/-) and GABA(B(1b))(-/-) mice in different types of cognitive paradigms. GABA(B(1a))(-/-) and GABA(B(1b))(-/-) mice were both impaired relative to wildtype controls in a continuous spontaneous alternation behaviour test of working spatial memory. In contrast to the reported phenotype of GABA(B(1))(-/-) mice, however, neither GABA(B(1a))(-/-) nor GABA(B(1b))(-/-) mice were deficient in a passive avoidance task. On the other hand, GABA(B(1a))(-/-) mice were impaired in familiar and novel object recognition. We conclude that GABA(B(1)) isoforms contribute differentially to GABA(B) receptor-mediated cognitive processes."
"Although recent work on amygdalar function has concentrated on a role in fear and anxiety, a possible role in reward processes continues to be considered. This function may occur via anatomical connections between the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the mesoaccumbens dopamine (DA) system (i.e., ventral tegmental area [VTA] to nucleus accumbens septi [NAS]), particularly at the level of the NAS. The current experiments investigated a possible role of the BLA in the reward of intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) of the VTA. Rats were trained in either an autotitration ICSS task or a rate-frequency ICSS task. We examined the effect of intra-BLA injections of muscimol, a GABA(A) agonist which inhibits the firing of most neurons, on VTA ICSS in both behavioral procedures. The injections produced a pattern of behavioral change which, across the two tasks, was more consistent with a change in behavioral processes other than primary reward. Possible processes include cost/benefit analysis and incentive motivation."
"Human adolescents often associate tobacco smoking and consumption of alcoholic beverages. In spite of this frequent association, little is known about the basic neurobiology of the dual exposure in the adolescent brain. In the present work, we assessed, through the use of the step-through passive avoidance box (2mA, 2s; test-retest interval of 24h), short- and long-term memory/learning effects of nicotine (NIC) and/or ethanol (ETOH) exposure during adolescence (postnatal days 30-45: PN30-45) in four groups of male and female C57BL/6 mice: (1) concomitant NIC [nicotine free base solution (50microg/ml) in 2% saccharin to drink] and ETOH [ethanol solution (25%, 2g/kg) i.p. injected every other day] exposure; (2) NIC exposure; (3) ETOH exposure; (4) vehicle. During exposure (PN44-45), deficits in memory/learning due to concomitant NIC+ETOH exposure reflected the summation of the two individual sets of effects. During a short-term drug withdrawal (PN49-50), nicotine improved memory/learning, however, ethanol blocked nicotine-induced improvements. One month post-exposure (PN74-75), a significant female-only improvement in memory/learning was observed as a result of co-administration. In conclusion, our results suggest that detrimental effects of nicotine and ethanol on memory/learning during adolescent combined exposure represent a worsened outcome from the dual exposure. However, negative effects of the combined exposure fail to persist during withdrawal. In fact, the combined exposure elicits a sex-dependent late onset beneficial effect on memory/learning during withdrawal."
"Diverse cholinergic signaling mechanisms regulate the excitability of striatal principal neurons and modulate striatal-dependent behavior. These effects are mediated, in part, by action at muscarinic receptors (mAChR), subtypes of which exhibit distinct patterns of expression across striatal neuronal populations. Non-selective mAChR blockade within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been shown to disrupt operant responding for food and to inhibit food consumption. However, the specific receptor subtypes mediating these effects are not known. Thus, we evaluated effects of intra-NAc infusions of pirenzepine and methoctramine, mAChR antagonisits with distinct binding affinity profiles, on operant responding for sucrose reward under a progressive ratio (PR) reinforcement schedule. Moderate to high doses of methoctramine disrupted operant responding and reduced behavioral breakpoint. In contrast, pirenzepine failed to impact operant performance at any dose tested. Methoctramine failed to affect latencies to complete appetitive-consummatory response sequences or to impact measures of acoustic startle, suggesting that its' disruptive effects on operant behavior were not consequent to gross motor impairment. Since methoctramine has a greater affinity for M(2) receptors compared to pirenzepine, which has a greater relative affinity for M(1) and M(3) receptors, these findings suggest that M(2) mAChRs within the NAc regulate behavioral processes underling the acquisition of reward."
"Adaptations to the chronic administration of opioids reduce the utility of these drugs in treating pain and support addiction. Recent genetics-based approaches have implicated the beta2 adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) in controlling some of these responses. We do not know, however, whether this receptor can modulate tolerance, dependence or changes in gene expression caused by chronic opioid administration. For our studies we used C57BL/6 mice and beta2-AR knockout mice in the FVB background. Morphine dose-response relationships were established both prior to and after chronic morphine treatment. In some cases, the selective beta2-AR antagonist butoxamine was administered along with or after morphine. Physical dependence was assessed using naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. The expression of calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) were measured in spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) tissues using both real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). Both the co-administration of butoxamine with morphine and the administration of butoxamine after chronic morphine reversed morphine tolerance. Morphine failed to cause tolerance in beta2-AR knockout mice. Physical dependence was reduced under the same circumstances. The chronic administration of butoxamine with morphine reduced or eliminated the normally observed up-regulation of CGRP and SP in spinal cord and DRG tissues. Our results suggest that the beta2-AR modulates both opioid tolerance and physical dependence. Activation of beta2-ARs appears to be required for some of the key neurochemical changes which characterize chronic opioid administration. Therefore, beta2-AR antagonists show some promise as agents to enhance chronic opioid analgesic therapy."
"Many studies of interest in motor behaviour and motor impairment in mice use equally treadmill or track as a routine test. However, the literature in mammals shows a wide difference of results between the kinematics of treadmill and overground locomotion. To study these discrepancies, we analyzed the locomotion of adult SWISS-OF1 mice over a large range of velocities using treadmill and overground track. The use of a high-speed video camera combined with cinefluoroscopic equipment allowed us to quantify in detail the various space and time parameters of limb kinematics. The results show that mice maintain the same gait pattern in both conditions. However, they also demonstrate that during treadmill exercise mice always exhibit higher stride frequency and consequently lower stride length. The relationship of the stance time and the swing time against the stride frequency are still the same in both conditions. We conclude that the conflict related to the discrepancy between the proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual inputs contribute to an increase in the stride frequency during the treadmill locomotion."
"Stressors increase corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) functioning in hypothalamic and frontal cortical brain regions, and thus may contribute to the provocation of anxiety and depressive disorder. As the effects of stressors on these behavioral changes are more pronounced in some strains of mice (e.g., BALB/cByJ) than in others (e.g., C57BL/6ByJ), the present investigation assessed whether acute and chronic stressors would differentially influence CRH receptor immunoreactivity (ir-CRHr) and CRH receptor mRNA expression (CRH(1) and CRH(2)) in the orbital frontal cortex (OFC) of these strains. An acute noise stressor, and to a greater extent a chronic, variable stressor regimen reduced ir-CRHr in BALB/cByJ mice. In contrast, in the hardier C57BL/6ByJ mice the acute stressor increased ir-CRHr in portions of the OFC, whereas a chronic stressor tended to reduce ir-CRHr. However, whereas the acute stressor did not influence CRH(1) mRNA expression, the chronic stressor increased CRH(1) mRNA expression in both mouse strains. The CRH(2) expression appeared in low abundance in both strains and was unaltered by the stressor. In addition to the OFC variations, quantitative immunohistochemistry indicated that the chronic stressor treatment increased CRH immunoreactivity in the median eminence of C57BL/6ByJ mice, but co-expression of CRH and arginine vasopressin (AVP) immunoreactivity was not provoked by the stressors. The data support the view that stressors provoke marked variations of ir-CRHr in the OFC that might contribute to the differential anxiety/depression-like profiles ordinarily apparent in the stressor-vulnerable and -resilient mouse strains."
"This study examined the effects of a standard breast cancer chemotherapeutic protocol on learning and memory in rats. Ovariectomized rats were treated once a week for 3 weeks with a combination of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin prior to training in a classical fear conditioning task. Training took place 1 week after the final treatment. During the training session, an auditory stimulus (a tone) was paired with a mild foot-shock. The resulting conditioned fear to the tone (cue-specific fear) and to the training environment (contextual fear) was measured in subsequent test sessions. Chemotherapy did not affect the acquisition of the conditioned response (freezing) during the training session or the expression of fear during the tone test session. In contrast, rats treated with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin exhibited decreased freezing during the context test session, suggestive of a specific deficit in hippocampal-related learning and memory. Together, these data indicate that administration of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin may have toxic effects on the hippocampus and results in specific learning deficits shortly after treatment has ended."
"Brain opioids regulate social emotional responsivity. One neuro-evolutionary theory of addiction suggests that exogenous opiates may induce addiction via opioid-controlled emotional changes; with the drug eventually fulfilling the need for social comfort that is normally provided by endogenous opioids. This view predicts that past opiate experience may enduringly alter social responsivity. Although the acute social effects of opiates are well known, little evidence is available concerning the enduring effects of past opiate experience on social motivation aside from copulatory behaviors. This study evaluated the long-term effects of 10 daily morphine (10mg/kg/day) or saline injections on social and non-social motivated behaviors. Following 3 days or 2 weeks drug abstinence, social interest, food-seeking, and sexual pursuit were assessed. After 2-weeks opiate withdrawal, sexual pursuit and food-seeking behaviors were significantly increased. After a shorter 3-day withdrawal, these effects were not seen. Importantly, social interest was consistently magnified, even after short-term 3-day opiate withdrawal, and it was magnified more than sexual or food pursuit. These findings indicate that the incentive for social and non-social natural rewards were increased following withdrawal from intermittent opiate treatment, but that different morphine-induced neuroadaptations may regulate their expression."
"In the neuroscience community interest for using the pig is growing. Several disease models have been developed creating a need for validation of behavioural paradigms in these animals. Here, we report the effect of different inter-phase delay intervals on the performance of G&#xf6;ttingen minipigs in the spontaneous object recognition test. The test consisted of a sample and a test phase. First, the pigs explored two similar objects. After a 10-min, 1-h, or 24-h delay two different objects were presented; one familiar from the sample phase and one novel. An exploration-time difference between the novel and the familiar object was interpreted as recognition of the familiar object. We scored the exploration times both manually and automatically, and compared the methods. A strong discrimination between novel and familiar objects after a 10-min inter-phase delay interval and no discrimination after 24h were found in our set-up of the spontaneous object recognition test. After a 1-h delay, the pigs still showed a significant habituation to the familiar object, but no discrimination was observed. Discrimination between the two objects was mainly confined to the first half of the test phase, and we observed a high between-subject variation. Furthermore, automatic tracking was valid for determination of habituation and discrimination parameters but lead to an overestimation of individual measurements. We conclude that the spontaneous object recognition test for pigs is sensitive to increasing inter-phase delay intervals, and that automatic data acquisition can be applied."
"Previous research has shown that evaluation of pain shown in pictures is mediated by a cortical circuit consisting of the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex (SI and SII), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the insula. SI and SII subserve the sensory-discriminative component of pain processing whereas ACC and the insula mediate the affective-motivational aspect of pain processing. The current work investigated the neural correlates of evaluation of pain depicted in words. Subjects were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while reading words or phrases depicting painful or neutral actions. Subjects were asked to rate pain intensity of the painful actions depicted in words or counting the number of Chinese characters in the words. Relative to the counting task, rating pain intensity induced activations in SII, the insula, the right middle frontal gyrus, the left superior temporal sulcus and the left middle occipital gyrus. Our results suggest that both the sensory-discriminative and affective-motivational components of the pain matrix are engaged in the processing of pain depicted in words."
"Isolated clefts of the lip and/or palate (ICLP) are developmental craniofacial abnormalities that have consistently been linked to increased social inhibition or shyness. Two explanations have been proposed: (1) psychosocial factors related to differences in facial appearance may lead to low self-concept and subsequent shyness, or (2) abnormal development of brain structures involved in social function, such as the ventral frontal cortex (VFC), may underlie the difference. To investigate these two possibilities this study was designed to evaluate measures of social function in relation to measures of self-concept and VFC morphology. Subjects included 30 boys (age 7-12) with ICLP and a comparison group of 43 boys without cleft in the same age category. Social function and self-concept were assessed using questionnaires with standardized scoring filled out by subjects and one of their parents. The cortical volume and surface area of the VFC, composed of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and straight gyrus (SG), were evaluated using structural magnetic resonance imaging. The ICLP subjects had significantly impaired social function relative to the comparison group. No difference in self-concept was identified. VFC morphology revealed significant differences between groups, particularly decreased volume and surface area in the left SG of the ICLP group. Moreover, abnormal VFC measures were correlated with social dysfunction but measures of self-concept were not. These results are consistent with the possibility that aberrant VFC development may partially underlie social dysfunction in boys with ICLP."
"The present study evaluated the effects of the principal active component of marijuana (delta 9 THC) on motor abilities and motor learning in mice with cerebellar dysfunction. For this purpose, spontaneous locomotor activity, equilibrium abilities, muscular tone, motor coordination and motor learning were investigated in Lurcher mutant and non-mutant B6/CBA mice 20 min after i.p. administration of 4 or 8 mg kg(-1) of delta 9 tetra hydro cannabinol (delta 9 THC). The performances were compared to those obtained by Lurcher and non-mutant mice injected with vehicle (Tween 80). The results showed that at the dose of 4 mg kg(-1) but not at the dose of 8 mg kg(-1), the cannabinoid (CB) substance reduced deficits in motor coordination, equilibrium and muscular tone and facilitated motor learning in Lurcher mice. On the other hand, only a muscular strength decrease was observed in control B6/CBA mice injected with the dose of 8 mg kg(-1) of delta 9 THC. These results suggested that cannabinoid derivative could represent a new field of investigation concerning the treatment of cerebellar ataxic syndrome in humans."
"The ataxic mouse mutant robotic is characterised by progressive adult-onset Purkinje cell loss that occurs in a distinctive region-specific pattern. We report the first behavioural characterisation of this mutant and quantify its performance on tests of motor function, locomotor and exploratory activity over a time course that reflects specific stages of cell loss in the cerebellum. Robotic mutants are significantly impaired on the rotarod and static rod tests of coordination and their performance declined during aging. In addition, gait analysis revealed an increase in the severity of the ataxia displayed by mutants over time. Interestingly, spontaneous alternation testing in a T-maze was not significantly affected in robotic mice, unlike other ataxic mutants with more rapid and extensive cerebellar degeneration; robotic therefore provides an opportunity to investigate the necessity of specific Purkinje cell populations for various behavioural tasks."
"Environmental temperature is known to affect a variety of biological processes ranging from simple chemical reactions up to ecological distribution of animal species. To our knowledge, however, there are no studies relating environmental temperature and exploration in the elevated plus-maze. The present study was aimed at investigating the influence of animal house temperature on the exploration of an elevated plus-maze. Fifty-seven male Wistar-derived rats were divided into five groups which were kept for 96-h in an animal house with different temperatures (18, 22, 26, 30 or 34 degrees C) and then tested in the elevated plus-maze. Results showed that the animals submitted to the higher temperatures decreased body weight, frequency of entries into both the open and closed arm, time spent in the open arm extremities, distance run in the closed arms and frequency of rearing while increasing the mean duration of each entry into both the open and closed arms. There were no significant effects on the time spent in the open arms and the percentage of entries into the open arms. These effect are probably due to thermal stress and do not relate to emotional changes but rather to modifications in general activity. The frequency of stretching and head-dipping exhibited different profile reactions to temperature when compared to the above measures. These behavioral modifications are also consistent with the effects of thermal stress rather than alterations in emotionality."
"Maternal infection during pregnancy is a risk factor for some psychiatric illnesses of neurodevelopmental origin such as schizophrenia and autism. In experimental animals, behavioral and neuropathological outcomes relevant to schizophrenia have been observed in offspring of infected dams. However, the type of infectious agent used and gestational age at time of administration have varied. The objective of the present study was to compare the effects of prenatal challenge with different immune agents given at different time windows during gestation on behavioral outcomes in offspring. For this, pregnant rats were administered bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), the viral mimic polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), or turpentine, an inducer of local inflammation, at doses known to produce fever, at three different stages in pregnancy: embryonic day (E)10-11, E15-16 and E18-19. Prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle (PPI) was later measured in male adult offspring. PPI was significantly decreased in offspring after prenatal LPS treatment at E15-16 and E18-19. Intramuscular injection of pregnant dams with turpentine at E15-16 also decreased PPI in adult offspring. Maternal poly I:C administration had no significant effect on PPI in offspring. In contrast to prenatal LPS exposure, acute LPS administration to naive adult males had no effect on PPI. Thus, prenatal exposure both to a systemic immunogen and to local inflammation at brief periods during later pregnancy produced lasting deficits in PPI in rat offspring. These findings support the idea that maternal infection during critical windows of pregnancy could contribute to sensorimotor gating deficits in schizophrenia."
"The study of medial-temporal amnesics has established that much of the brain's store of general knowledge can be retrieved without the hippocampus. Several brain imaging studies, however, have reported that the hippocampus is active during the performance of semantic memory tasks. Although this activity may reflect memory encoding, it is also possible that it is due to the process of retrieving the semantic representations of the stimuli. Here we show in two H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography studies that cerebral blood flow (CBF) to the hippocampus covaries with superior performance during the retrieval of general knowledge. Left hippocampal CBF was associated with faster word meaning retrieval and right hippocampal CBF with better picture naming. A follow-up experiment failed to show that faster responding in the word meaning task was associated with better episodic memory for the stimuli and so weakens the proposal that the hippocampal activity was strictly related to memory encoding. In both experiments CBF to the lateral temporal cortex covaried with hippocampal CBF in a way that suggests that the hippocampus provides complementary support to activation within the association cortex."
"The effects of melatonin (Mel) on the development of tolerance to antinociceptive actions induced by mu- and delta-opioid receptor agonists were determined in male Kunming mice. In the mouse tail-flick tests, selective mu and delta receptor agonists were repeatedly administered to mice supraspinally (intracerebroventricularly, i.c.v.) in the absence or presence of melatonin. Administration of endomorphin-1 (EM-1, a mu-opioid receptor agonist) or deltorphin I (del I, a delta-opioid receptor agonist) twice daily for 4 days produced antinociceptive tolerance compared with vehicle controls. Co-administration with melatonin prevented the development of tolerance to deltorphin I analgesia, and this effect was dose dependent. However, melatonin did not affect the development of antinociceptive tolerance to endomorphin-1. Additionally, the attenuation of deltorphin I tolerance by melatonin was reduced by chronic treatment with luzindole (luz), a selective antagonist on the MT(2) receptor subtype. Taken together, these data suggest that melatonin interferes with the neural mechanisms involved in the development of tolerance to delta-opioid agonist analgesia via its receptor."
"We previously reported that systemic or central amygdala injections of the mGluR(2/3) agonist LY379268 (which decreases glutamate release) prevented enhanced cue-induced cocaine seeking in extinction tests after prolonged withdrawal (incubation of cocaine craving). Here, we report that systemic and central amygdala injections of LY379268 also prevented the enhanced cue-induced sucrose seeking in extinction tests after prolonged sucrose-free period (incubation of sucrose craving). These findings suggest that central amygdala glutamate plays an important role in the incubation of reward craving after withdrawal from both drug and non-drug rewards."
"We previously reported that vasopressin deficient Brattleboro (BRAT) rats exhibit deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex that are consistent with PPI deficits exhibited by patients with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Preliminary evidence indicates that this may be the basis of a predictive model for antipsychotic drug efficacy. Here we report the effects of acute and chronic administration of established and putative antipsychotics on these PPI deficits. BRAT rats, compared to their derivative strain, Long Evans rats, exhibited significantly decreased PPI and startle habituation consistent with patients with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The second generation antipsychotics, risperidone and clozapine as well as a neurotensin agonist (PD149163) increased BRAT rat PPI, whereas saline, the typical antipsychotic, haloperidol, and a vasopressin analog (1-desamino-D-arginine vasopressin) did not. Similar to their effects in humans, chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs produced stronger effects than acute administration. These results further support the BRAT rat as a model of sensorimotor gating deficits with predictive validity for antipsychotics. The model appears to be able to differentiate first generation from second generation antipsychotics, identify putative antipsychotics with novel mechanisms (i.e., peptides) and reasonably model the therapeutic time course of antipsychotic drugs in humans."
"Rats treated with apomorphine and amphetamine display sensorimotor gating impairments, as measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI), and these impairments can be reversed by antipsychotic treatment. However, it remains unknown whether the dopamine (DA) D(3) receptor plays a role in mediating these effects on PPI, as none of these DA agonists or antipsychotics are exclusively selective at either D(2) or D(3) receptors. To address this question, the current study was designed to investigate whether antipsychotic drugs and selective D(3) antagonists could block the PPI-disruptive effects of PD 128907 (a preferential D(3) agonist) and apomorphine. We found that the effect of PD 128907 on PPI in rats could be antagonized by risperidone, clozapine, and the selective D(3) antagonists SB 277011 and A-691990, but not by raclopride or haloperidol, while the apomorphine-induced PPI deficit could be reversed by risperidone, clozapine and haloperidol, but not by SB 2770111 and A-691990. These results suggest that the D(3) receptor does not mediate apomorphine-induced disruption of PPI in rats, however, given the findings that PD 128907 elicited a PPI-disruptive effect that was blocked by selective D(3) antagonists, a role of D(3) receptor in mediating PPI in rats cannot be ruled out. The possible mechanisms of D(3) receptor involvement in PPI are discussed."
"Benzodiazepines such as diazepam, lorazepam, are reported to produce anterograde amnesia but these do not affect the retrieval mechanism. Triazodiazepines such as alprazolam, triazolam and brotizolam produce both anterograde and retrograde amnesia. Because benzodiazepine receptor antagonists are known to reverse anterograde amnesia, we wanted to test if inverse agonist can also improve learning and memory. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of norharmane (benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist) and L-glutamic acid (glutamate receptor agonist) on brotizolam induced anterograde and retrograde amnesia using Morris water maze task in mice. Norharmane reversed anterograde amnesia induced by brotizolam and did not reverse retrograde amnesia induced by it. L-Glutamic acid attenuated retrograde amnesia but did not affect anterograde amnesia induced by brotizolam. These results provide an opportunity to understand the mechanisms of anterograde and retrograde amnesia which may occur with interaction of presynaptic molecules or LTP modulation."
"The hypothalamic arcuate, dorsomedial and paraventricular nuclei are involved in regulation of body weight and food intake and contain binding sites for the anorexigenic amylin. Effects of amylin on medial arcuate and paraventricular neurons studied in adult rats overweight through early postnatal overfeeding in small litters (SL) differed from those of control litters (CL). Now we observed that also dorsomedial neurons respond differentially to this satiety signal. They were significantly inhibited by amylin in SL but not CL rats. Since the histaminergic system seems to be involved in mediating effects of amylin, we studied the role of histamine H(1)-receptors. Single unit activity was recorded in brain slices of CL and SL rats in each of the three hypothalamic nuclei. The histamine H(1)-receptor antagonist pyrilamine differentially altered or reduced responses to amylin, not depending on the kind of litter but on the functional effect of the peptide. Pyrilamine prevented significant inhibition of medial arcuate neurons in controls as well as inhibition of dorsomedial and paraventricular neurons in SL rats. Searching for further mechanisms possibly contributing to the change of neuronal responses we found that in the presence of a GABA(A)-receptor antagonist amylin induced a significant inhibition of medial arcuate neurons in SL rats similar to that in CL without antagonist. Activation of medial arcuate neurons expressing the orexigenic neuropeptide Y and inhibition of dorsomedial and paraventricular neurons in SL rats may in vivo contribute to hyperphagia and overweight. Histamine H(1)-receptors and GABA(A)-receptors seem to be differentially involved in mediation of these effects."
"Recently, we have reported that quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, prevents memory impairment and hippocampus neurodegeneration induced by global cerebral ischemia (GCI). In the present study, we examined the possible effects of quetiapine on other behavioural deficits, including the depressive and anxiolytic-like behavioural consequences of GCI. Mice were treated with quetiapine (5 or 10mg/kg/day; intraperitoneal (i.p.)) for 14 days. On Day 15, the animals were subjected to GCI. GCI resulted in a decrease of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunostaining and induced depressive and anxiolytic-like behavioural changes. The behavioural changes were indicated by a significant increase in the immobility duration in a tail-suspension test, and an increase in the time spent in the light box in a light/dark box test. Pre-administration of quetiapine significantly alleviated the decreased TH immunostaining and attenuated the depressive and anxiolytic-like behavioural changes induced by GCI. These results enhance our understanding about the mechanisms of quetiapine and suggest a wider perspective for the clinical use of quetiapine."
"Whether the delta-opioid receptor (DOR) system can modulate behavioral effects of cocaine remains equivocal. We examined whether site- and subtype-selective blockade of DORs within the rat mesocorticolimbic system affects cocaine self-administration. The DOR antagonist naltrindole 5'-isothiocyanate (5'-NTII; 5nmol) was microinjected into the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), ventral tegmental area (VTA), or amygdala (AMYG) in rats self-administering 1.5mg/kg cocaine under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule. Intra-NAcc 5'-NTII significantly decreased cocaine self-administration, while 5'-NTII administration into the VTA significantly increased cocaine-maintained responding. 5'-NTII administration into the AMYG produced no effect. These data support a site-specific role of DORs in cocaine's behavioral effects."
"Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) is a naturally occurring human cytokine that is a key therapy in the treatment of several viral diseases and cancers. However, treatment can produce significant neuropsychiatric and neurotoxic adverse events, including depression and anxiety. Here we investigated the effects of a clinically-comparable treatment regime of IFN-alpha on depressive- and anxiety-like behaviour in rats; and also examined frontal-cortical and hippocampal BDNF levels. Rats treated with IFN-alpha for four weeks showed significant increases in depressive- and anxiety-like behaviour. Further experimental investigation revealed that hedonic dysregulation (stronger preference for a sweet solution) did not emerge until the second week of treatment, and became more persistent as treatment progressed. No significant IFN-alpha-induced changes in BDNF levels were found. These results indicate that the affective deficits seen in patients may be modelled in healthy animals. This model may represent a novel tool to investigate the extent of and mechanisms underlying the IFN-alpha psychiatric syndrome."
"Oleamide, a fatty acid amide accumulates selectively in the cerebrospinal fluid of sleep deprived cats and rats. Oleamide has been reported to have effects on a wide range of receptors and neurotransmitter systems especially the centrally acting ones for example, dopamine acetylcholine, serotonin, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), cannabinoid and vanilloid among others. This suggests a wide range of central nervous system effects of the compound. The effects of intraperitoneal administered oleamide on Novelty-induced behaviours, learning and memory and forced swimming-induced depression were studied. The relative effects of the compound on the male and female mice were also noted. Oleamide dose-dependently reduced (p&lt;0.05) novelty induced rearing, grooming and locomotion. The effects on the all NIBs started within the first 10 min of the test and the peak of the effects was observed during the third 10 min period of the test. Effect of oleamide on short-term working memory was significantly (p&lt;0.05) affected only with the dose of 5mg/kg while the other dose of 10mg/kg had no effect. In the forced swimming test, acute triple intraperitoneal administration of oleamide at 10mg/kg induced a significant reduction in the immobility duration in mice signifying an antidepressant effect. Sex differences in the effects of oleamide (10mg/kg, i.p.) were clearly evident in active behaviours in FST. These results confirm the multiplicity of central nervous system receptors and neurotransmitters that oleamide interacts with hence its numerous and diverse neuropharmacological effects. Most importantly, the present study suggests that oleamide has antidepressant-like property."
"The present study investigated urinary scent marking behavior in male C57BL/6J (C57) mice as olfactory social signaling. In Experiment 1, when compared scent marking toward adult males, C57 males showed substantial scent marking toward CD-1 males and even toward the odor alone of CD-1 males, but not toward C57 males. Experiment 2 explored scent marking in C57 males of different ages to males and females, and juveniles and adults of the same strain. C57 males deposited more marks than control conditions only toward an adult C57 female when tested at 100 days of age, but not at 60 days of age. Development of urine marking behavior was investigated in C57 males at the ages of 30, 60, 90, and 120 days in Experiment 3. When tested alone (control) or confronted with a C57 male, C57 males showed diminished scent marks throughout development. Compared to controls, marking toward a CD-1 male increased after the age of 60 days, while marks toward an adult female showed significant increases after the age of 90 days. This difference in scent marking depending on the sex of the stimulus animal is likely to be associated with development of sexual behavior, in which males need to set up territories against other males prior to advertising to females. Although highly inbred strains have similar odor components, C57 males are able to detect and deposit urine marks after puberty as social communication depending on age, sex, and genetic differences in the opponents."
"Serotonin, acting through a cAMP-signaling pathway, delayed habituation to criterion of the leech's swim response to touch. This delay was reversed by crushing the connective between serotonin-exposed and serotonin-naive ganglia, and correlated with an increase in spontaneous impulse activity in this connective. We suggest that increased activity in intersegmental interneurons may play a role in maintaining swim responsiveness when concentrations of serotonin are elevated."
"Sleep/wake regulation is quite different during the neonatal and adult periods. Although cholinergic neurons have been recognized to be the major source of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep regulation in adulthood, their effect on neonatal REM sleep remains to be discovered. Current evidence suggests that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) may play a role in REM promotion during the neonatal period. We conducted the following study to test our hypothesis that blocking CRF R1 receptor would reduce REM sleep in developing rat pups. First, rat pups were surgically implanted with electrodes on postnatal day (PN) 13. On PN 14, six hours of polysomnographic (PSG) data were collected before and after administration of three different doses of NBI 27914 (NBI), a CRF R1 receptor antagonist. Compared with baseline, REM sleep was significantly reduced in all groups treated with NBI but not with dimethyl sulfoxide/saline. The reduction of REM sleep was dose-related and was replaced primarily by non-REM (NREM) sleep. Second, two groups of rat pups were given a single dose of either NBI or vehicle on PN 14 for quantification of ACTH and acetylcholine without PSG recording. NBI induced no change of either ACTH or acetylcholine. Third, the effect of administering atropine (6 mg/kg) on sleep/wake in two-week-old rats was investigated. Atropine suppressed REM sleep significantly and increased wakefulness simultaneously. Our data revealed that blockage of CRF R1 receptors deprives neonatal REM sleep. The mechanism for CRF in enhancing REM sleep may be associated with but not be similar to the cholinergic mechanism."
"Drug memory plays an important role in priming subsequent drug use. We used drug-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) as a paradigm to study such drug memory. In this paradigm, repeated association of specific environmental cues with abused drug-induced subjective euphoria has been suggested to motivate later biased approaching behavior toward the euphoria-linked environment at a drug-free status. Our previous report indicated that formation of methamphetamine-induced CPP was independent of de novo protein synthesis. We suspected that methamphetamine-produced effects independent of its hedonic value may be responsible for the drug-induced place preference. One such possibility was that methamphetamine treatment directly disrupted the sensory encoding process and rodents' novelty-seeking propensity consequently determined the biased place performance. We observed that mice undergoing three times of methamphetamine and compartment pairings exhibited similar compartment preference as those with only one or two methamphetamine-compartment pairings even though they all experienced three vehicle-compartment pairings. Moreover, 30 min before the CPP test, single methamphetamine injection at a dose of 1mg/kg abolished methamphetamine (1mg/kg)-induced CPP, while one dose of cocaine (5mg/kg) did not affect cocaine (5mg/kg)-induced CPP under a similar protocol. Finally, pretreatment with 1mg/kg of methamphetamine impaired the spontaneous alteration and recognition performance in Y maze task and impeded the object recognition performance. Taken together, we conclude that methamphetamine-induced CPP performance may be, in part, caused by methamphetamine-impaired sensory processing."
"Gonadal steroid effects during puberty are often hypothesized to account for the male advantage seen in certain spatial tasks. One spatial task where males consistently show better performance than females is the Morris Water Task in which subjects must navigate to a goal location in a pool. We examined whether sex differences exist in pre-pubertal children completing a Virtual Morris Water Task, which has previously shown strong sex differences in adults. Pre-pubertal boys show superior performance to similar-aged girls, as evidenced by shorter latencies to find the platform and stronger preferences for the platform location during a probe trial. These results suggest that sex differences in spatial learning and memory exist prior to puberty and do not appear to require the effects of sex hormones at puberty. Rather, these differences may reflect early-life hormonal effects on hippocampal-dependent processes and may suggest different preferential learning strategies by boys and girls."
"In humans and laboratory animal models, vulnerability to alcohol abuse is influenced by endogenous factors such as genotype. Using the inbred Fischer and Lewis rat strains, we previously reported stronger conditioned taste aversions (CTA) in male Fischer rats that could not be predicted by genotypic differences in alcohol absorption [Roma PG, Flint WW, Higley JD, Riley AL. Assessment of the aversive and rewarding effects of alcohol in Fischer and Lewis rats. Psychopharmacology (Berl) 2006;189:187-99]. The present study made similar assessments in Fischer and Lewis females via four-trial CTA induced by 1 or 1.5 g/kg intraperitoneal (IP) ethanol (n=10-12/strain/dose) as well as measures of blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) at 15, 60 and 180 min post-injection with 1.5 g/kg IP ethanol or saline (n=7-8/strain/dose). Dose-dependent CTAs were produced, but the strains did not differ from each other in these measures; however, BACs in the Lewis females were significantly higher than Fischer at all three time points. As with males of the Fischer and Lewis genotypes, a dissociation between BACs and the aversive effects of alcohol was observed. These data are the first assessments of these particular phenotypes in Fischer and Lewis females, and when considered with the historical data, suggest a Genotype x Sex interaction in the centrally mediated sensitivity to alcohol's aversive effects."
"The objective of the current study was to investigate the behavioral changes of glioma-bearing nude mice and functional outcome from treatment with a novel antiangiogenesis regimen, which is a combination of monoclonal antibodies against both vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1 (MF1) and VEGFR-2 (DC101). The reliability and responsiveness of behavioral measurement with the rearing test were first examined in nude mice bearing two kinds of gliomas--9L gliosarcoma and U87 human glioma, which have different growth rates. Using immunohistochemical staining and fluorescent imaging techniques, upregulation of the angiogenesis marker VEGF, coincident with the abnormal neovascular architecture, was confirmed in the human U87 glioma model. The behavioral measurement was then applied to assess functional outcome with the combination antibody treatment in the orthotopic mouse model of human U87 glioma. The combination antibody therapy retarded tumor progression and delayed the onset of significant behavioral deficits. Histologically, tumor necrosis and apoptosis were increased and tumor cell proliferation was decreased after treatment. In clinical trials for novel interventions, functional end points typically are included in the assessment of potential efficacy. Because certain interventions that successfully treat tumor progression in animal models might interfere with compensatory neuroplasticity, functional measurement may be valuable for improving the clinical relevance of translational brain tumor research."
"Visual illusions are formed by differences between the perception of one figure and its real physical characteristics. The M&#xfc;ller-Lyer illusion is the best known and most studied geometric illusion, consisting in the subject's judgment between two parallel lines that have the same size, one flanked with outward-pointing arrowheads, and the other with inward-pointing arrowheads. These arrowheads act as inductors that make the lines to be perceived as having different sizes, inward-pointing stimuli being estimated as longer. This study aimed to investigate the M&#xfc;ller-Lyer illusion in capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella), a New World primate not yet investigated for this illusion. For this purpose, stimuli were presented on a touch screen monitor. Ten adult subjects (five females and five males) were used. Before the tests, they were trained to discriminate between two physically different lines with and without arrowheads. The longer lines were always the positive (rewarded) stimuli. Regarding the M&#xfc;ller-Lyer Illusion test, all monkeys, unrespective of gender, demonstrated susceptibility to the illusion, by choosing preferentially the line with inward-pointing arrowheads. In order to determine the degree of the illusion, a point of subjective equality test (PSE) was performed. The PSE without arrowheads values were lower than the PSE with arrowheads. Thus, it was demonstrated that capuchin monkeys were susceptible to the M&#xfc;ller-Lyer illusion, once the perception of the lines' size was influenced by the presence of the arrowheads and by their orientation."
"The present experiments were designed to study fear conditioning as an emotional learning task with disrupted visceral feedback. For that purpose we used the peripherally acting beta1-adrenoceptor blocker atenolol and studied its effects on the behavior of male C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice in an exploration-related test and during fear-conditioning. In the first experiment, we treated mice with saline or different doses of the beta1-adrenergic blocker atenolol (5mg/kg and 20mg/kg body weight i.p.) 30 min before behavioral testing in a motility box. Only the high but not the low dose of atenolol led to a reduction of locomotor activity (p&lt;0.02). Factors known to be related to emotionality (rearing, area preference) were unaffected. In a second experiment, saline- and atenolol-treated mice (same dosages and mode of application) were trained for auditory fear conditioning, and 24h later they were retested in the same environment. We found differences between the effects of atenolol upon contextual- and cue-fear conditioning. Animals treated with 20mg/kg BW doses of atenolol showed significantly decreased background contextual fear compared to saline-treated control animals. In contrast, no differences were found during CS presentation in the conditioning context between atenolol-treated animals and saline-treated controls, independent from a paired or an unpaired conditioning paradigm. Thus, the blockade of peripheral beta1-adrenoceptors by atenolol may have disrupted the positive feedback to the central nervous system via visceral afferents resulting in a decreased locomotor activity and background contextual fear."
"The exploratory behavior of rats on an open field is organized in that animals spend disproportionate amounts of time at certain locations, termed home bases, which serve as centers for excursions. Although home bases are preferentially formed near distinctive cues, including visual cues, animals also visit and pause and move slowly, or linger, at many other locations in a test environment. In order to further examine the organization of exploratory behavior, the present study examined the influence of the point of entry on animals placed on an open field table that was illuminated either by room light or infrared light (a wavelength in which they cannot see) and near which, or on which, distinctive cues were placed. The main findings were that in both room light and infrared light tests, rats visited and lingered at the point of entry significantly more often than comparative control locations. Although the rats also visited and lingered in the vicinity of salient visual cues, the point of entry still remained a focus of visits. Finally, the preference for the point of entry increased as a function of salience of the cues marking that location. That the point of entry influences the organization of exploratory behavior is discussed in relation to the idea that the exploratory behavior of the rat is directed toward optimizing security as well as forming a spatial representation of the environment."
"Aim of a present study was to find genes in the periaqueductal grey (PAG) related to the exploratory behavior in rats. Male Wistar rats were divided according to their exploratory behavior in the elevated plus-maze model of anxiety into two groups: high (non-anxious) and low (anxious) exploratory activity. Differential expression of genes was analyzed using the cDNA representational difference analysis (RDA). Q-RT-PCR was used to confirm most prominent changes and functional annotation of the identified genes was performed to establish pathways related to exploratory behavior of rats. We found different genetic activation related to the exploratory activity of rats. Rats with low exploratory activity showed increase in the intracellular signal transduction and in GABA, vasopressin and adrenergic receptor activities. Functional annotation confirmed significant induction of cAMP system and GTPases in rats with anxious-type behavior. On the other hand, rats with high exploratory activity in the elevated plus-maze (non-anxious type of behavior) had increased activity of genes forming ""behavioral fear response"" system. These changes were specific to PAG, because they were not found in the cerebellum. In addition, plasma corticosterone levels were significantly higher in rats with non-anxious behavior compared to anxious behavior. Our results show that non-anxious behavior is related to activation of ""fear response system"" and more intense activation of HPA axis. Possibly it means that this system helps animals to cope with the threatening circumstances. More detailed analysis of this potential ""fear response system"" is necessary in the further studies for understanding its role in the regulation of emotional behavior."
"There is much evidence suggesting early life events, such has handling or repeated separations from the nest, can have a long-term effect on the biological and behavioral development of rats. The current study examined the effect of repeated maternal separation (MS) on the behavioral, cardiovascular, and neurobiological responses to stress in subjects vulnerable to environmental stressors as adults. Borderline hypertensive rats (BHR), which are the first generation offspring of spontaneously hyperternsive and Wistar-Kyoto rats, were separated from the dams for 3h per day from postnatal day 1 through 14. Non-separated controls remained in the home cage. When allowed to explore the open field chamber for 60 min as adults, MS subjects had significantly greater locomotor activity compared to controls. All subjects were exposed to 30 min of restraint stress during which time mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were measured. Although both groups had comparable increases in MAP, MS animals displayed significantly higher HR throughout the stress period. Finally, MS subjects had significantly more stress-induced Fos positive cells, an estimate of neuronal activation, in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), each of which plays an important role in organizing the biobehavioral response to stress. These results suggest that maternal separation can further enhance stress reactivity in this model and may represent a useful approach for studying the relationship between early life events and future vulnerability to stressful situations."
"During agonistic interactions between male Anolis carolinensis, perception of a visual sign stimulus (darkened eyespots) not only inhibits aggression and promotes initial attainment of dominant social status, but also evokes distinct neuroendocrine responses in each opponent. This study was designed to examine the effect of eyespot manipulation on behavior and social rank during a second interaction between opponents that had previously established a natural dyadic social hierarchy. Prior to a second interaction, eyespots of familiar size-matched combatants were manipulated to reverse information conveyed by this visual signal. Eyespots on the previously dominant male were masked with green paint to indicate low aggression and social status. Previously subordinate males had their eyespots permanently marked with black paint to convey high aggression and status. Opponents were then re-paired for a second 10 min interaction following either 1 or 3 days of separation. Aggression was generally decreased and social status between pairs remained reasonably consistent. Unlike rapidly activated monoaminergic activity that occurs following the initial pairing, most brain areas sampled were not affected when animals were re-introduced, regardless of visual signal reversal or length of separation between interactions. However in males with ""normal"" eyespot color, dominant males had reduced serotonergic activity in CA(3) and raph&#xe9;, while subordinate males exhibited elevated CA(3) dopaminergic activity. Reversing eyespot color also reversed serotonergic activity in raph&#xe9; and dopaminergic activity in CA(3) after 3 days of separation. The results suggest that males remember previous opponents, and respond appropriately to their previous social rank in spite of eyespot color."
"Complex interactions between pain perception, anxiety and depressive symptoms have repeatedly been described. However, pathophysiological or biochemical mechanisms underlying the alterations of pain perception in patients suffering from anxiety or depression still remain a matter of debate. Thus, we aimed to perform an investigation on pain perception in an animal model of extremes in anxiety-related behaviour, which might provide a tool for future studies. Here, thermal pain thresholds were obtained from rats with a genetic predisposition to high anxiety-related behaviour (HAB), including signs of comorbid depression-like behaviour and from controls (low-anxiety rats (LAB); cross-bred HAB and LAB rats; Wistar rats). Furthermore, the effect of eight-week antidepressive treatment using citalopram and of short-term anxiolytic treatment with diazepam on pain-related behaviour was assessed. Simultaneously, anxiety-related behaviour was monitored. At baseline, HAB animals showed 35% higher thresholds for thermal pain than controls. These were normalized to control levels after eight weeks of continuous citalopram treatment paralleled by a reduction of anxiety-related behaviour, but also acutely after diazepam administration. Overall, thermal pain thresholds in HAB animals are shifted in a similar fashion as seen in patients suffering from major depressive disorder. Antidepressive, as well as anxiolytic treatments, attenuated these differences. As the relative importance of the factors anxiety and depression cannot be derived from this study with certainty, extending these investigations to additional animal models might represent a valuable tool for future investigations concerning the interrelations between anxiety, depression, and pain at a molecular level."
"Blocking the process of memory reconsolidation by means of amnestic agents may prove to have therapeutic applications. Here we used a morphine-induced conditioned place preference as an index of drug seeking. After inducing in rats a preference for a distinctive compartment paired with morphine, the memory for drug experience was reactivated by a 20-min test session and saline, the beta-antagonist propranolol, or the peripherally acting beta-antagonist nadolol were administered. Animals which received saline or nadolol upon reactivation, or propanolol without memory reactivation, maintained their preference for the drug-paired compartment 24h and seven days later. However, animals that received propranolol upon reactivation no longer displayed a morphine preference on either test, although these animals once again expressed a preference when given a morphine-primed retest at 10 days. Our results suggest that beta-blockers may have potential for attenuating the impact of cue-induced craving which is a major cause of relapse in detoxified addicts."
