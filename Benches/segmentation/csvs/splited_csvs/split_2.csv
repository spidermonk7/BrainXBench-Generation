Abstract
"Lipid peroxidation is a key to a portfolio of neurodegenerative diseases and plays a central role in &#x3b1;-synuclein (&#x3b1;-syn) toxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal death, all key processes in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are important constituents of the synaptic and mitochondrial membranes and are often the first molecular targets attacked by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The rate-limiting step of the chain reaction of ROS-initiated PUFAs autoxidation involves hydrogen abstraction at bis-allylic sites, which can be slowed down if hydrogens are replaced with deuteriums. In this study, we show that targeted overexpression of human A53T &#x3b1;-syn using an AAV vector unilaterally in the rat substantia nigra reproduces some of pathological features seen in PD patients. Chronic dietary supplementation with deuterated PUFAs (D-PUFAs), specifically 0.8% D-linoleic and 0.3% H-linolenic, produced significant disease-modifying beneficial effects against &#x3b1;-syn-induced motor deficits, synaptic pathology, oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, disrupted trafficking along axons, inflammation and DA neuronal loss. These findings support the clinical evaluation of D-PUFAs as a neuroprotective therapy for PD."
"The neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by hyperphosphorylated tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid-beta (A&#x3b2;) plaques. A&#x3b2; plaques are hypothesized to follow a development sequence starting with diffuse plaques, which evolve into more compact plaques and finally mature into the classic cored plaque type. A better molecular understanding of A&#x3b2; pathology is crucial, as the role of A&#x3b2; plaques in AD pathogenesis is under debate. Here, we studied the deposition and fibrillation of A&#x3b2; in different plaque types with label-free infrared and Raman imaging. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman imaging was performed on native snap-frozen brain tissue sections from AD cases and non-demented control cases. Subsequently, the scanned tissue was stained against A&#x3b2; and annotated for the different plaque types by an AD neuropathology expert. In total, 160 plaques (68 diffuse, 32 compact, and 60 classic cored plaques) were imaged with FTIR and the results of selected plaques were verified with Raman imaging. In diffuse plaques, we detect evidence of short antiparallel &#x3b2;-sheets, suggesting the presence of A&#x3b2; oligomers. A&#x3b2; fibrillation significantly increases alongside the proposed plaque development sequence. In classic cored plaques, we spatially resolve cores containing predominantly large parallel &#x3b2;-sheets, indicating A&#x3b2; fibrils. Combining label-free vibrational imaging and immunohistochemistry on brain tissue samples of AD and non-demented cases provides novel insight into the spatial distribution of the A&#x3b2; conformations in different plaque types. This way, we reconstruct the development process of A&#x3b2; plaques in human brain tissue, provide insight into A&#x3b2; fibrillation in the brain, and support the plaque development hypothesis."
"Histone H3.3 mutation (H3F3A) occurs in 50% of cortical pediatric high-grade gliomas. This mutation replaces glycine 34 with arginine or valine (G34R/V), impairing SETD2 activity (H3K36-specific trimethyltransferase). Consequently, reduced H3K36me3 is observed on H3.3G34V nucleosomes relative to wild-type, contributing to genomic instability and driving a distinct gene expression signature associated with tumorigenesis. However, it is not known if this differential H3K36me3 enrichment is due to H3.3G34V mutant protein alone. Therefore, we set to elucidate the effect of H3.3G34V mutant protein in pediatric glioma on H3K36me3, H3K27me3 and H3.3 enrichment in vitro. We found that the doxycycline-inducible shRNA knockdown of mutant H3F3A encoding the H3.3G34V protein resulted in loss of H3.3G34V enrichment and increased H3K36me3 enrichment throughout the genome. After knockdown, H3.3G34V enrichment was preserved at loci observed to have the greatest H3.3G34V and H3K36me3 enrichment prior to knockdown. Induced expression of mutant H3.3G34V protein in vitro was insufficient to induce genomic H3K36me3 enrichment patterns observed in H3.3G34V mutant glioma cells. We also observed strong co-enrichment of H3.3G34V and wild-type H3.3 protein, as well as greater H3K27me3 enrichment, in cells expressing H3.3G34V. Taken together, our study demonstrates the effects of H3.3G34V mutant protein on genomic H3K36me3, H3K27me3 and H3.3 enrichment patterns in isogenic cell lines."
"CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy is an adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia caused by colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) gene mutations. The disease has a global distribution and currently has no cure. Individuals with CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy variably present clinical symptoms including cognitive impairment, progressive neuropsychiatric and motor symptoms. CSF1R is predominantly expressed on microglia within the central nervous system (CNS), and thus CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy is now classified as a CNS primary microgliopathy. This urgent unmet medical need could potentially be addressed by using microglia-based immunotherapies. With the rapid recent progress in the experimental microglial research field, the replacement of an empty microglial niche following microglial depletion through either conditional genetic approaches or pharmacological therapies (CSF1R inhibitors) is being studied. Furthermore, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation offers an emerging means of exchanging dysfunctional microglia with the aim of reducing brain lesions, relieving clinical symptoms and prolonging the life of patients with CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy. This review article introduces recent advances in microglial biology and CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy. Potential therapeutic strategies by replacing microglia in order to improve the quality of life of CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy patients will be presented."
"Neuronal dendritic and synaptic pruning are early features of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. In addition to brain pathology, amyloid plaque deposition, microglial activation, and cell loss occur in the retinas of human patients and animal models of Alzheimer's disease. Retinal ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina, are vulnerable to damage in neurodegenerative diseases and are a potential opportunity for non-invasive clinical diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer's progression. However, the extent of retinal involvement in Alzheimer's models and how well this reflects brain pathology is unclear. Here we have quantified changes in retinal ganglion cells dendritic structure and hippocampal dendritic spines in three well-studied Alzheimer's mouse models, Tg2576, 3xTg-AD and APP<sup>NL-G-F</sup>. Dendritic complexity of DiOlistically labelled retinal ganglion cells from retinal explants was reduced in all three models in an age-, gender-, and receptive field-dependent manner. DiOlistically labelled hippocampal slices showed spine loss in CA1 apical dendrites in all three Alzheimer's models, mirroring the early stages of neurodegeneration as seen in the retina. Morphological classification showed that loss of thin spines predominated in all. The demonstration that retinal ganglion cells dendritic field reduction occurs in parallel with hippocampal dendritic spine loss in all three Alzheimer's models provide compelling support for the use of retinal neurodegeneration. As retinal dendritic changes are within the optical range of current clinical imaging systems (for example optical coherence tomography), our study makes a case for imaging the retina as a non-invasive way to diagnose disease and monitor progression in Alzheimer's disease."
"The term ""Primary age-related tauopathy"" (PART) was coined in 2014 to describe the common neuropathological observation of neurofibrillary tangles without associated beta-amyloid&#xa0;(A&#x3b2;) pathology. It is possible for PART pathology to be present in both cognitively normal and cognitively impaired individuals. Genetically, Apolipoprotein E (APOE) &#x3b5;4 has been shown to occur less commonly in PART than in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigate the relationships between PART, AD and those pathologically normal for age, with an emphasis on APOE and cognition, using 152 selected participants from The University of Manchester Longitudinal Study of Cognition in Normal Healthy Old Age and the Manchester arm of the Brains for Dementia Research cohort. APOE genotype differed between PART and AD with APOE &#x3b5;2 more common in the former and APOE &#x3b5;4 more common in the latter. Individuals with definite PART were less likely to be cognitively impaired than those with AD and those with pathology considered pathologically normal for age. We postulate that the lack of A&#x3b2; in definite PART cases may be due either to an increased frequency of APOE &#x3b5;2 or decreased frequency of APOE &#x3b5;4 as their resulting protein isoforms have differing binding properties in relation to A&#x3b2;. Similarly, an increased frequency of APOE &#x3b5;2 or decreased frequency of APOE &#x3b5;4 may lead to decreased levels of cognitive impairment, which raises questions regarding the impact of A&#x3b2; pathology on overall cognition in elderly subjects. We suggest that it may be possible to use the increased frequency of APOE &#x3b5;2 in definite PART to assist neuropathological diagnosis."
"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are activated fibroblasts constituting the major stromal components in many types of cancer. CAFs contribute to hallmarks of cancer such as proliferation, invasion and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and are associated with poor prognosis of patients with cancer. However, in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and aggressive primary malignant brain tumor, our knowledge about CAFs or CAF-like stromal cells is limited. Here, using commonly accepted CAF markers, we characterized CAF-like cell populations in clinical glioma specimens and datasets along with mouse models of GBM. We found that tumor-associated pericytes marked by co-expression of fibroblast activation protein &#x3b1; (FAP) and PDGFR&#x3b2; represent major stromal cell subsets in both human GBM and mouse GBM models, while a fraction of mesenchymal neoplastic cells also express FAP in patient tumors. Since oncolytic viruses can kill cancer cells and simultaneously modulate the tumor microenvironment by impacting non-neoplastic populations such as immune cells and tumor vasculature, we further investigated the ability of oncolytic viruses to target GBM-associated stromal cells. An oncolytic adenovirus, ICOVIR15, carrying &#x2206;24-E1A and an RGD-fiber, infects and depletes FAP+ pericytes as well as GBM cells in murine GBM. Our study thus identifies FAP+/PDGFR&#x3b2;+ pericytes as a major CAF-like stromal cell population in GBM, and highlights the unique property of this oncolytic adenovirus to target both GBM cells and GBM-associated stromal FAP+ cells."
"Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although microglia in aging and neurodegenerative disease model mice show a loss of homeostatic phenotype and activation of disease-associated microglia (DAM), a correlation between those phenotypes and the degree of neuronal cell loss has not been clarified. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing of microglia isolated from three representative neurodegenerative mouse models, App<sup>NL-G-F/NL-G-F</sup> with amyloid pathology, rTg4510 with tauopathy, and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> with motor neuron disease by magnetic activated cell sorting. In parallel, gene expression patterns of the human precuneus with early Alzheimer's change (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11) and control brain (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;14) were also analyzed by RNA sequencing. We found that a substantial reduction of homeostatic microglial genes in rTg4510 and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> microglia, whereas DAM genes were uniformly upregulated in all mouse models. The reduction of homeostatic microglial genes was correlated with the degree of neuronal cell loss. In human precuneus with early AD pathology, reduced expression of genes related to microglia- and oligodendrocyte-specific markers was observed, although the expression of DAM genes was not upregulated. Our results implicate a loss of homeostatic microglial function in the progression of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, analyses of human precuneus also suggest loss of microglia and oligodendrocyte functions induced by early amyloid pathology in human."
"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by loss of lower motor neurons, which leads to proximal muscle weakness and atrophy. SMA is caused by reduced survival motor neuron (SMN) protein levels due to biallelic deletions or mutations in the SMN1 gene. When SMN levels fall under a certain threshold, a plethora of cellular pathways are disturbed, including RNA processing, protein synthesis, metabolic defects, and mitochondrial function. Dysfunctional mitochondria can harm cells by decreased ATP production and increased oxidative stress due to elevated cellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since neurons mainly produce energy via mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, restoring metabolic/oxidative homeostasis might rescue SMA pathology. Here, we report, based on proteome analysis, that SMA motor neurons show disturbed energy homeostasis due to dysfunction of mitochondrial complex I. This results in a lower basal ATP concentration and higher ROS production that causes an increase of protein carbonylation and impaired protein synthesis in SMA motor neurons. Counteracting these cellular impairments with pyruvate reduces elevated ROS levels, increases ATP and SMN protein levels in SMA motor neurons. Furthermore, we found that pyruvate-mediated SMN protein synthesis is mTOR-dependent. Most importantly, we showed that ROS regulates protein synthesis at the translational initiation step, which is impaired in SMA. As many neuropathies share pathological phenotypes such as dysfunctional mitochondria, excessive ROS, and impaired protein synthesis, our findings suggest new molecular interactions among these pathways. Additionally, counteracting these impairments by reducing ROS and increasing ATP might be beneficial for motor neuron survival in SMA patients."
"In this study, we report the results of a comprehensive phenotyping of the retina of the App<sup>NL-G-F</sup> mouse. We demonstrate that soluble A&#x3b2; accumulation is present in the retina of these mice early in life and progresses to A&#x3b2; plaque formation by midlife. This rising A&#x3b2; burden coincides with local microglia reactivity, astrogliosis, and abnormalities in retinal vein morphology. Electrophysiological recordings revealed signs of neuronal dysfunction yet no overt neurodegeneration was observed and visual performance outcomes were unaffected in the App<sup>NL-G-F</sup> mouse. Furthermore, we show that hyperspectral imaging can be used to quantify retinal A&#x3b2;, underscoring its potential as a biomarker for AD diagnosis and monitoring. These findings suggest that the App<sup>NL-G-F</sup> retina mimics the early, preclinical stages of AD, and, together with retinal imaging techniques, offers unique opportunities for drug discovery and fundamental research into preclinical AD."
"Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1) is a neurocutaneous genetic syndrome characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, including benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor called neurofibroma. These tumors originate from the Schwann cell lineage but other cell types as well as extracellular matrix (ECM) in the neurofibroma microenvironment constitute the majority of the tumor mass. In fact, collagen accounts for up to 50% of the neurofibroma's dry weight. Although the presence of collagens in neurofibroma is indisputable, the exact repertoire of ECM genes and ECM-associated genes (i.e. the matrisome) and their functions are unknown. Here, transcriptome profiling by single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the matrisome of human cutaneous neurofibroma (cNF). We discovered that classic pro-fibrogenic collagen I myofibroblasts are rare in neurofibroma. In contrast, collagen VI, a pro-tumorigenic ECM, is abundant and mainly secreted by neurofibroma fibroblasts. This study also identified potential cell type-specific markers to further elucidate the biology of the cNF microenvironment."
"During the last decade, multiple clinical trials for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) have focused on the induction of dystrophin expression using different strategies. Many of these trials have reported a clear increase in dystrophin protein following treatment. However, the low levels of the induced dystrophin protein have raised questions on its functionality. In our present study, using an unbiased, high-throughput digital image analysis platform, we assessed markers of regeneration and levels of dystrophin associated protein via immunofluorescent analysis of whole muscle sections in 25 DMD boys who received 48-weeks treatment with exon 53 skipping morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (PMO) golodirsen. We demonstrate that the de novo dystrophin induced by exon skipping with PMO golodirsen is capable of conferring a histological benefit in treated patients with an increase in dystrophin associated proteins at the dystrophin positive regions of the sarcolemma in post-treatment biopsies. Although 48&#xa0;weeks treatment with golodirsen did not result in a significant change in the levels of fetal/developmental myosins for the entire cohort, there was a significant negative correlation between the amount of dystrophin and levels of regeneration observed in different biopsy samples. Our results provide, for the first time, evidence of functionality of induced dystrophin following successful therapeutic intervention in the human."
"Vascular dysregulation and cholinergic basal forebrain degeneration are both early pathological events in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Acetylcholine contributes to localised arterial dilatation and increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) during neurovascular coupling via activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Decreased vascular reactivity is suggested to contribute to impaired clearance of &#x3b2;-amyloid (A&#x3b2;) along intramural periarterial drainage (IPAD) pathways of the brain, leading to the development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). However, the possible relationship between loss of cholinergic innervation, impaired vasoreactivity and reduced clearance of A&#x3b2; from the brain has not been previously investigated. In the present study, intracerebroventricular administration of mu-saporin resulted in significant death of cholinergic neurons and fibres in the medial septum, cortex and hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice. Arterial spin labelling MRI revealed a loss of CBF response to stimulation of eNOS by the Rho-kinase inhibitor fasudil hydrochloride in the cortex of denervated mice. By contrast, the hippocampus remained responsive to drug treatment, in association with altered eNOS expression. Fasudil hydrochloride significantly increased IPAD in the hippocampus of both control and saporin-treated mice, while increased clearance from the cortex was only observed in control animals. Administration of mu-saporin in the TetOAPPSweInd mouse model of AD was associated with a significant and selective increase in A&#x3b2;40-positive CAA. These findings support the importance of the interrelationship between cholinergic innervation and vascular function in the aetiology and/or progression of CAA and suggest that combined eNOS/cholinergic therapies may improve the efficiency of A&#x3b2; removal from the brain and reduce its deposition as CAA."
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) represent two ends of the same disease spectrum of adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases that affect the motor and cognitive functions, respectively. Multiple common genetic loci such as fused in sarcoma (FUS) have been identified to play a role in ALS and FTD etiology. Current studies indicate that FUS mutations incur gain-of-toxic functions to drive ALS pathogenesis. However, how the disease-linked mutations of FUS affect cognition remains elusive. Using a mouse model expressing an ALS-linked human FUS mutation (R514G-FUS) that mimics endogenous expression patterns, we found that FUS proteins showed an age-dependent accumulation of FUS proteins despite the downregulation of mouse FUS mRNA by the R514G-FUS protein during aging. Furthermore, these mice developed cognitive deficits accompanied by a reduction in spine density and long-term potentiation (LTP) within the hippocampus. At the physiological expression level, mutant FUS is distributed in the nucleus and cytosol without apparent FUS aggregates or nuclear envelope defects. Unbiased transcriptomic analysis revealed a deregulation of genes that cluster in pathways involved in nonsense-mediated decay, protein homeostasis, and mitochondrial functions. Furthermore, the use of in vivo functional imaging demonstrated widespread reduction in cortical volumes but enhanced functional connectivity between hippocampus, basal ganglia and neocortex in R514G-FUS mice. Hence, our findings suggest that disease-linked mutation in FUS may lead to changes in proteostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction that in turn affect brain structure and connectivity resulting in cognitive deficits."
"Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43&#xa0;kDa&#xa0;(TDP-43) has been identified as the major component of ubiquitinated inclusions found in patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Increasing evidence suggests prion-like transmission of TDP-43 aggregates via neuroanatomic connection in vitro and pyramidal tract in vivo. However, it is still unknown whether the spreading of pathological TDP-43 sequentially via pyramidal tract can initiate ALS-like pathology and phenotypes. In this study, we reported that injection of TDP-43 preformed fibrils (PFFs) into the primary motor cortex (M1) of Thy1-e (IRES-TARDBP) 1 mice induced the spreading of pathological TDP-43 along pyramidal tract axons anterogradely. Moreover, TDP-43 PFFs-injected Thy1-e (IRES-TARDBP) 1 mice displayed ALS-like neuropathological features and symptoms, including motor dysfunctions and electrophysiological abnormalities. These findings provide direct evidence that transmission of pathological TDP-43 along pyramidal tract induces ALS-like phenotypes, which further suggest the potential mechanism for TDP-43 proteinopathy."
"Cancer cells optimize nutrient utilization to supply energetic and biosynthetic pathways. This metabolic process also includes redox maintenance and epigenetic regulation through nucleic acid and protein methylation, which enhance tumorigenicity and clinical resistance. However, less is known about how cancer cells exhibit metabolic flexibility to sustain cell growth and survival from nutrient starvation. Here, we find that serine and glycine levels were higher in low-nutrient regions of tumors in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients than they were in other regions. Metabolic and functional studies in GBM cells demonstrated that serine availability and one-carbon metabolism support glioma cell survival following glutamine deprivation. Serine synthesis was mediated through autophagy rather than glycolysis. Gene expression analysis identified upregulation of methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) to regulate one-carbon metabolism. In clinical samples, MTHFD2 expression was highest in the nutrient-poor areas around ""pseudopalisading necrosis."" Genetic suppression of MTHFD2 and autophagy inhibition caused tumor cell death and growth inhibition of glioma cells upon glutamine deprivation. These results highlight a critical role for serine-dependent one-carbon metabolism in surviving glutamine starvation and suggest new therapeutic targets for glioma cells adapting to a low-nutrient microenvironment."
"The cellular complexity of glioblastoma microenvironments is still poorly understood. In-depth, cell-resolution tissue analyses of human material are rare but highly necessary to understand the biology of this deadly tumor. Here we present a unique 3D visualization revealing the cellular composition of human GBM in detail and considering its critical association with the neo-vascular niche. Our images show a complex vascular map of human 3D biopsies with increased vascular heterogeneity and altered spatial relationship with astrocytes or glioma-cell counterparts. High-resolution analysis of the structural layers of the blood brain barrier showed a multilayered fenestration of endothelium and basement membrane. Careful examination of T cell position and migration relative to vascular walls revealed increased infiltration corresponding with tumor proliferation. In addition, the analysis of the myeloid landscape not only showed a volumetric increase in glioma-associated microglia and macrophages relative to GBM proliferation but also revealed distinct phenotypes in tumor nest and stroma. Images and data sets are available on demand as a resource for public access."
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects motoneurons. Mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) have been described as a causative genetic factor for ALS. Mice overexpressing ALS-linked mutant SOD1 develop ALS symptoms accompanied by histopathological alterations and protein aggregation. The protein disulfide isomerase family member ERp57 is one of the main up-regulated proteins in tissue of ALS patients and mutant SOD1 mice, whereas point mutations in ERp57 were described as possible risk factors to develop the disease. ERp57 catalyzes disulfide bond formation and isomerization in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), constituting a central component of protein quality control mechanisms. However, the actual contribution of ERp57 to ALS pathogenesis remained to be defined. Here, we studied the consequences of overexpressing ERp57 in experimental ALS using mutant SOD1 mice. Double transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>/ERp57<sup>WT</sup> animals presented delayed deterioration of electrophysiological activity and maintained muscle innervation compared to single transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> littermates at early-symptomatic stage, along with improved motor performance without affecting survival. The overexpression of ERp57 reduced mutant SOD1 aggregation, but only at disease end-stage, dissociating its role as an anti-aggregation factor from the protection of neuromuscular junctions. Instead, proteomic analysis revealed that the neuroprotective effects of ERp57 overexpression correlated with increased levels of synaptic and actin cytoskeleton proteins in the spinal cord. Taken together, our results suggest that ERp57 operates as a disease modifier at early stages by maintaining motoneuron connectivity."
"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a clinically heterogeneous disorder with a substantial burden on healthcare. Despite this, the genetic basis of the disorder is not well defined and its boundaries with other neurodegenerative diseases are unclear. Here, we performed whole exome sequencing of a cohort of 1118 Caucasian DLB patients, and focused on genes causative of monogenic neurodegenerative diseases. We analyzed variants in 60 genes implicated in DLB, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and atypical parkinsonian or dementia disorders, in order to determine their frequency in DLB. We focused on variants that have previously been reported as pathogenic, and also describe variants reported as pathogenic which remain of unknown clinical significance, as well as variants associated with strong risk. Rare missense variants of unknown significance were found in APP, CHCHD2, DCTN1, GRN, MAPT, NOTCH3, SQSTM1, TBK1 and TIA1. Additionally, we identified a pathogenic GRN p.Arg493* mutation, potentially adding to the diversity of phenotypes associated with this mutation. The rarity of previously reported pathogenic mutations in this cohort suggests that the genetic overlap of other neurodegenerative diseases with DLB is not substantial. Since it is now clear that genetics plays a role in DLB, these data suggest that other genetic loci play a role in this disease."
"Huntington Disease (HD) is an inherited movement disorder caused by expanded CAG repeats in the Huntingtin gene. We have used single nucleus RNASeq (snRNASeq) to uncover cellular phenotypes that change in the disease, investigating single cell gene expression in cingulate cortex of patients with HD and comparing the gene expression to that of patients with no neurological disease. In this study, we focused on astrocytes, although we found significant gene expression differences in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia as well. In particular, the gene expression profiles of astrocytes in HD showed multiple signatures, varying in phenotype from cells that had markedly upregulated metallothionein and heat shock genes, but had not completely lost the expression of genes associated with normal protoplasmic astrocytes, to astrocytes that had substantially upregulated glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and had lost expression of many normal protoplasmic astrocyte genes as well as metallothionein genes. When compared to astrocytes in control samples, astrocyte signatures in HD also showed downregulated expression of a number of genes, including several associated with protoplasmic astrocyte function and lipid synthesis. Thus, HD astrocytes appeared in variable transcriptional phenotypes, and could be divided into several different ""states"", defined by patterns of gene expression. Ultimately, this study begins to fill the knowledge gap of single cell gene expression in HD and provide a more detailed understanding of the variation in changes in gene expression during astrocyte ""reactions"" to the disease."
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, adult-onset degenerative disorder of motor neurons. The diseased spinal cord motor neurons of more than 95% of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients are characterized by the mis-metabolism of the RNA/DNA-binding protein TDP-43 (ALS-TDP), in particular, the presence of cytosolic aggregates of the protein. Most available mouse models for the basic or translational studies of ALS-TDP are based on transgenic overexpression of the TDP-43 protein. Here, we report the generation and characterization of mouse lines bearing homologous knock-in of fALS-associated mutation A315T and sALS-associated mutation N390D, respectively. Remarkably, the heterozygous TDP-43 (N390D/+) mice but not those heterozygous for the TDP-43 (A315T/+) mice develop a full spectrum of ALS-TDP-like pathologies at the molecular, cellular and behavioral levels. Comparative analysis of the mutant mice and spinal cord motor neurons (MN) derived from their embryonic stem (ES) cells demonstrates that different ALS-associated TDP-43 mutations possess critical ALS-causing capabilities and pathogenic pathways, likely modified by their genetic background and the environmental factors. Mechanistically, we identify aberrant RNA splicing of spinal cord Bcl-2 pre-mRNA and consequent increase of a negative regulator of autophagy, Bcl-2, which correlate with and are caused by a progressive increase of TDP-43, one of the early events associated with ALS-TDP pathogenesis, in the spinal cord of TDP-43 (N390D/+) mice and spinal cord MN derived from their ES cells. The TDP-43 (N390D/+) knock-in mice appear to be an ideal rodent model for basic as well as translational studies of ALS- TDP."
"Diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M-mutant is a lethal brain tumor located in the thalamus, brain stem, or spinal cord. H3 K27M encoded by the mutation of a histone H3 gene such as H3F3A plays a pivotal role in the tumorigenesis of this type of glioma. Although several studies have revealed comprehensive genetic and epigenetic profiling, the prognostic factors of these tumors have not been identified to date. In various cancers, oncogenic driver genes have been found to exhibit characteristic copy number alterations termed mutant allele specific imbalance (MASI). Here, we showed that several diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M-mutant exhibited high variant allele frequency (VAF) of the mutated H3F3A gene using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) assays. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) revealed that these cases had various copy number alterations that affected the mutant and/or wild-type alleles of the H3F3A gene. We also found that these MASI cases showed a significantly higher Ki-67 index and poorer survival compared with those in the lower VAF cases (P&#xa0;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Our results indicated that the MASI of the H3F3A K27M mutation was associated with the aggressive phenotype of the diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M-mutant via upregulation of the H3 K27M mutant protein, resulting in downregulation of H3K27me3 modification."
"Human WWOX gene resides in the chromosomal common fragile site FRA16D and encodes a tumor suppressor WW domain-containing oxidoreductase. Loss-of-function mutations in both alleles of WWOX gene lead to autosomal recessive abnormalities in pediatric patients from consanguineous families, including microcephaly, cerebellar ataxia with epilepsy, mental retardation, retinal degeneration, developmental delay and early death. Here, we report that targeted disruption of Wwox gene in mice causes neurodevelopmental disorders, encompassing abnormal neuronal differentiation and migration in the brain. Cerebral malformations, such as microcephaly and incomplete separation of the hemispheres by a partial interhemispheric fissure, neuronal disorganization and heterotopia, and defective cerebellar midline fusion are observed in Wwox<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Degenerative alterations including severe hypomyelination in the central nervous system, optic nerve atrophy, Purkinje cell loss and granular cell apoptosis in the cerebellum, and peripheral nerve demyelination due to Schwann cell apoptosis correspond to reduced amplitudes and a latency prolongation of transcranial motor evoked potentials, motor deficits and gait ataxia in Wwox<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Wwox gene ablation leads to the occurrence of spontaneous epilepsy and increased susceptibility to pilocarpine- and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures in preweaning mice. We determined that a significantly increased activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3&#x3b2; (GSK3&#x3b2;) occurs in Wwox<sup>-/-</sup> mouse cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. Inhibition of GSK3&#x3b2; by lithium ion significantly abolishes the onset of PTZ-induced seizure in Wwox<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Together, our findings reveal that the neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative deficits in Wwox knockout mice strikingly recapitulate the key features of human neuropathies, and that targeting GSK3&#x3b2; with lithium ion ameliorates epilepsy."
"The choroid plexus (CP) is strategically located between the peripheral blood and the cerebrospinal fluid, and is involved in the regulation of central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. In multiple sclerosis (MS), demyelination and inflammation occur in the CNS. While experimental animal models of MS pointed to the CP as a key route for immune cell invasion of the CNS, little is known about the distribution of immune cells in the human CP during progressive phases of MS. Here, we use immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy to explore the main immune cell populations in the CP of progressive MS patients and non-neuroinflammatory controls, in terms of abundance and location within the distinct CP compartments. We show for the first time that the CP stromal density of granulocytes and CD8+ T cells is higher in progressive MS patients compared to controls. In line with previous studies, the CP of both controls and progressive MS patients contains relatively high numbers of macrophages and dendritic cells. Moreover, we found virtually no B cells or plasma cells in the CP. MHCII+ antigen-presenting cells were often found in close proximity to T cells, suggesting constitutive CNS immune monitoring functions of the CP. Together, our data highlights the role of the CP in immune homeostasis and indicates the occurrence of mild inflammatory processes in the CP of progressive MS patients. However, our findings suggest that the CP is only marginally involved in immune cell migration into the CNS in chronic MS."
"Subdural haematomas (SDHs) are characterized by rapidly or gradually accumulated haematomas between the arachnoid and dura mater. The mechanism of haematoma clearance has not been clearly elucidated until now. The meningeal lymphatic vessel (mLV) drainage pathway is a novel system that takes part in the clearance of waste products in the central nervous system (CNS). This study aimed to explore the roles of the mLV drainage pathway in SDH clearance and its impacting factors. We injected FITC-500D, A488-fibrinogen and autologous blood into the subdural space of mice/rats and found that these substances drained into deep cervical lymph nodes (dCLNs). FITC-500D was also observed in the lymphatic vessels (LYVE+) of the meninges and the dCLNs in mice. The SDH clearance rate in SDH rats that received deep cervical lymph vessel (dCLV) ligation surgery was significantly lower than that in the control group, as evaluated by haemoglobin quantification and MRI scanning. The drainage rate of mLVs was significantly slower after the SDH model was established, and the expression of lymphangiogenesis-related proteins, including LYVE1, FOXC2 and VEGF-C, in meninges was downregulated. In summary, our findings proved that SDH was absorbed through the mLV drainage pathway and that haematomas could inhibit the function of mLVs."
"Glioblastoma is the most frequent and aggressive primary brain tumor, characterized by extensive brain invasion and rarely, systemic metastases. The pathogenesis of metastatic glioblastoma is largely unknown. We present the first integrated clinical/histologic/genetic analysis of 5 distinct brain and lung foci from a unique case of recurrent, multifocal, multicentric and metastatic glioblastoma. The initial right frontotemporal gliosarcoma received standard surgical/chemoradiation therapy and recurred 1.5&#x2009;years later, co-occurring with three additional masses localized to the ipsilateral temporal lobe, cerebellum and lung. Synchronous metastatic lung carcinoma was suspected in this long-term smoker patient with family history of cancer. However, glioblastoma was confirmed in all tumors, although with different morphologic patterns, including ependymomatous and epithelioid. Genomic profiling revealed a germline FANCD2 variant of unknown significance, and a 4-gene somatic mutation signature shared by all tumors, consisting of TERT promoter and PTEN, RB1 and TP53 tumor suppressor mutations. Additional GRIN2A and ATM heterozygous mutations were selected in the cerebellar and lung foci, but were variably present in the supratentorial foci, indicating reduced post-therapeutic genetic evolution in brain foci despite morphologic variability. Significant genetic drift characterized the lung metastasis, likely explaining the known resistance of circulating glioblastoma cells to systemic seeding. MET overexpression was detected in the initial gliosarcoma and lung metastasis, possibly contributing to invasiveness. This comprehensive analysis sheds light on the temporospatial evolution of glioblastoma and underscores the importance of genetic testing for diagnosis and personalized therapy."
"The discovery of mutations associated with familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), has brought imperative insights into basic mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and progression and has allowed researchers to create animal models that assist in the elucidation of the molecular pathways and development of therapeutic interventions. Position 717 in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a hotspot for mutations associated with autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) and the valine to isoleucine amino acid substitution (V717I) at this position was among the first ADAD mutations identified, spearheading the formulation of the amyloid cascade hypothesis of AD pathogenesis. While this mutation is well described in multiple kindreds and has served as the basis for the generation of widely used animal models of disease, neuropathologic data on patients carrying this mutation are scarce. Here we present the detailed clinical and neuropathologic characterization of an APP V717I carrier, which reveals important novel insights into the phenotypic variability of ADAD cases. While age at onset, clinical presentation and widespread parenchymal beta-amyloid (A&#x3b2;) deposition are in line with previous reports, our case also shows widespread and severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). This patient also presented with TDP-43 pathology in the hippocampus and amygdala, consistent with limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 proteinopathy (LATE). The APOE &#x3b5;2/&#x3b5;3 genotype may have been a major driver of the prominent vascular pathology seen in our case. These findings highlight the importance of neuropathologic examinations of genetically determined AD cases and demonstrate striking phenotypic variability in ADAD cases."
"Nemaline myopathy (NM) caused by mutations in the gene encoding nebulin (NEB) accounts for at least 50% of all NM cases worldwide, representing a significant disease burden. Most NEB-NM patients have autosomal recessive disease due to a compound heterozygous genotype. Of the few murine models developed for NEB-NM, most are Neb knockout models rather than harbouring Neb mutations. Additionally, some models have a very severe phenotype that limits their application for evaluating disease progression and potential therapies. No existing murine models possess compound heterozygous Neb mutations that reflect the genotype and resulting phenotype present in most patients. We aimed to develop a murine model that more closely matched the underlying genetics of NEB-NM, which could assist elucidation of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the disease. Here, we have characterised a mouse strain with compound heterozygous Neb mutations; one missense (p.Tyr2303His), affecting a conserved actin-binding site and one nonsense mutation (p.Tyr935*), introducing a premature stop codon early in the protein. Our studies reveal that this compound heterozygous model, Neb<sup>Y2303H, Y935X</sup>, has striking skeletal muscle pathology including nemaline bodies. In vitro whole muscle and single myofibre physiology studies also demonstrate functional perturbations. However, no reduction in lifespan was noted. Therefore, Neb<sup>Y2303H,Y935X</sup> mice recapitulate human NEB-NM and are a much needed addition to the NEB-NM mouse model collection. The moderate phenotype also makes this an appropriate model for studying NEB-NM pathogenesis, and could potentially be suitable for testing therapeutic applications."
"Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the accumulation of misfolded &#x3b1;-synuclein in selected brain regions, including the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), where marked loss of dopaminergic neurons is also observed. Yet, the relationship between misfolded &#x3b1;-synuclein and neurotoxicity currently remains unclear. As the principal route for degradation of misfolded proteins in mammalian cells, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is critical for maintenance of cellular proteostasis. Misfolded &#x3b1;-synuclein impairs UPS function and contributes to neuronal death in vitro. Here, we examine its effects in vivo using adeno-associated viruses to co-express A53T &#x3b1;-synuclein and the ubiquitinated reporter protein Ub<sup>G76V</sup>-GFP in rat SNpc. We found that &#x3b1;-synuclein over-expression leads to early-onset catalytic impairment of the 26S proteasome with associated UPS dysfunction, preceding the onset of behavioural deficits and dopaminergic neurodegeneration. UPS failure in dopaminergic neurons was also associated with selective accumulation of &#x3b1;-synuclein phosphorylated at the serine 129 residue, which has previously been linked to increased neurotoxicity. Our study highlights a role for &#x3b1;-synuclein in disturbing proteostasis which may contribute to neurodegeneration in vivo."
"Primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system (CNS-PNETs) are highly malignant neoplasms posing diagnostic challenge due to a lack of defining molecular markers. CNS neuroblastoma with forkhead box R2 (FOXR2) activation (CNS_NBL) emerged as a distinct pediatric brain tumor entity from a pool previously diagnosed as primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system (CNS-PNETs). Current standard of identifying CNS_NBL relies on molecular analysis. We set out to establish immunohistochemical markers allowing safely distinguishing CNS_NBL from morphological mimics. To this aim we analyzed a series of 84 brain tumors institutionally diagnosed as CNS-PNET. As expected, epigenetic analysis revealed different methylation groups corresponding to the (1) CNS-NBL (24%), (2) glioblastoma IDH wild-type subclass H3.3 G34 (26%), (3) glioblastoma IDH wild-type subclass MYCN (21%) and (4) ependymoma with RELA_C11orf95 fusion (29%) entities. Transcriptome analysis of this series revealed a set of differentially expressed genes distinguishing CNS_NBL from its mimics. Based on RNA-sequencing data we established SOX10 and ANKRD55 expression as genes discriminating CNS_NBL from other tumors exhibiting CNS-PNET. Immunohistochemical detection of combined expression of SOX10 and ANKRD55 clearly identifies CNS_NBL discriminating them to other hemispheric CNS neoplasms harboring ""PNET-like"" microscopic appearance. Owing the rarity of CNS_NBL, a confirmation of the elaborated diagnostic IHC algorithm will be necessary in prospective patient series."
"Synaptic pathology is a central event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative conditions, and investigation of synaptic proteins can provide valuable tools to follow synaptic dysfunction and loss in these diseases. Neuroligin-1 (Nlgn1) is a postsynaptic cell adhesion protein, important for synapse stabilization and formation. Nlgn1 has been connected to cognitive disorders, and specifically to AD, as target of the synaptotoxic effect of amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) oligomers and A&#x3b2; fibrils. To address changes in Nlgn1 expression in human brain, brain regions in different neurological disorders were examined by Western blot and mass spectrometry. Brain specimens from AD (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;23), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11), corticobasal degeneration (CBD, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;10), and Pick's disease (PiD, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;9) were included. Additionally, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of AD patients (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;43) and non-demented controls (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;42) were analysed. We found decreased levels of Nlgn1 in temporal and parietal cortex (~&#x2009;50-60% reductions) in AD brains compared with controls. In frontal grey matter the reduction was not seen for AD patients; however, in the same region, marked reduction was found for PiD (~&#x2009;77%), CBD (~&#x2009;66%) and to a lesser extent for PSP (~&#x2009;43%), which could clearly separate these tauopathies from controls. The Nlgn1 level was reduced in CSF from AD patients compared to controls, but with considerable overlap. The dramatic reduction of Nlgn1 seen in the brain extracts of tauopathies warrants further investigation regarding the potential use of Nlgn1 as a biomarker for these neurodegenerative diseases."
"Under normal conditions, astrocytes perform a number of important physiological functions centered around neuronal support and synapse maintenance. In neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and prion diseases, astrocytes acquire reactive phenotypes, which are sustained throughout the disease progression. It is not known whether in the reactive states associated with prion diseases, astrocytes lose their ability to perform physiological functions and whether the reactive states are neurotoxic or, on the contrary, neuroprotective. The current work addresses these questions by testing the effects of reactive astrocytes isolated from prion-infected C57BL/6J mice on primary neuronal cultures. We found that astrocytes isolated at the clinical stage of the disease exhibited reactive, pro-inflammatory phenotype, which also showed downregulation of genes involved in neurogenic and synaptogenic functions. In astrocyte-neuron co-cultures, astrocytes from prion-infected animals impaired neuronal growth, dendritic spine development and synapse maturation. Toward examining the role of factors secreted by reactive astrocytes, astrocyte-conditioned media was found to have detrimental effects on neuronal viability and synaptogenic functions via impairing synapse integrity, and by reducing spine size and density. Reactive microglia isolated from prion-infected animals were found to induce phenotypic changes in primary astrocytes reminiscent to those observed in prion-infected mice. In particular, astrocytes cultured with reactive microglia-conditioned media displayed hypertrophic morphology and a downregulation of genes involved in neurogenic and synaptogenic functions. In summary, the current study provided experimental support toward the non-cell autonomous mechanisms behind neurotoxicity in prion diseases and demonstrated that the astrocyte reactive phenotype associated with prion diseases is synaptotoxic."
"Nucleolar stress has been implicated in the pathology and disease pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) from repeat expansions of GGGGCC in C9orf72 (C9-ALS/FTLD) but not in sporadic ALS (SALS). Previously we reported that antisense RNA transcripts are unique in C9-ALS because of their nucleolar localization in spinal motor neurons and correlation with TDP-43 mislocalization, the hallmark proteinopathy of ALS and FTLD. Here we report our further studies of 11 SALS, 11 C9-ALS and 11 control spinal cords. We find that nucleolar stress manifests specifically as shrinkage in nucleoli of C9-ALS&#xa0;spinal motor neurons. Nucleolar size reduction is greatest in similarly sized alpha motor neurons from C9-ALS cases and results are not skewed by the number of surviving neurons from each ALS spinal cord. Surprisingly, nucleolar shrinkage occurs before main pathological hallmarks-TDP-43 mislocalization or antisense RNA foci-appear and this suggest that nucleolar stress can precede pathology in C9-ALS, findings previously identified in C9-FTLD using sense RNA foci and dipeptide repeat proteins as pathological markers. Importantly, these observations are also seen in SALS motor neurons and thus nucleolar stress appears to be a significant and probably upstream problem in sporadic disease."
"Brain iron accumulation has been found to accelerate disease progression in amyloid-&#x3b2;(A&#x3b2;)&#xa0;positive Alzheimer patients, though the mechanism is still unknown. Microglia have been identified as key&#xa0;players in the disease pathogenesis, and are highly reactive cells responding to aberrations such as increased iron levels. Therefore, using histological methods, multispectral immunofluorescence and an automated in-house developed microglia segmentation and analysis pipeline, we studied the occurrence of iron-accumulating microglia and the effect on its activation state in human Alzheimer brains. We identified a subset of microglia with increased expression of the iron storage protein ferritin light chain (FTL), together with increased Iba1 expression, decreased TMEM119 and P2RY12 expression. This activated microglia subset represented iron-accumulating microglia and appeared morphologically dystrophic. Multispectral immunofluorescence allowed for spatial analysis of FTL<sup>+</sup>Iba1<sup>+</sup>-microglia, which were found to be the predominant A&#x3b2;-plaque infiltrating microglia. Finally, an increase of FTL<sup>+</sup>Iba1<sup>+</sup>-microglia was seen in patients with high A&#x3b2; load and Tau load. These findings suggest iron to be taken up by microglia and to influence the functional phenotype of these cells, especially in conjunction with A&#x3b2;."
"Military veterans who experience blast-related traumatic brain injuries often suffer from chronic cognitive and neurobehavioral syndromes. Reports of abnormal tau processing following blast injury have raised concerns that some cases may have a neurodegenerative basis. Rats exposed to repetitive low-level blast exhibit chronic neurobehavioral traits and accumulate tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (Thr181). Using data previously reported in separate studies we tested the hypothesis that region-specific patterns of Thr181 phosphorylation correlate with behavioral measures also previously determined and reported in the same animals. Elevated p-tau Thr181 in anterior neocortical regions and right hippocampus correlated with anxiety as well as fear learning and novel object localization. There were no correlations with levels in amygdala or posterior neocortical regions. Particularly striking were asymmetrical effects on the right and left hippocampus. No systematic variation in head orientation toward the blast wave seems to explain the laterality. Levels did not correlate with behavioral measures of hyperarousal. Results were specific to Thr181 in that no correlations were observed for three other phospho-acceptor sites (threonine 231, serine 396, and serine 404). No consistent correlations were linked with total tau. These correlations are significant in suggesting that p-tau accumulation in anterior neocortical regions and the hippocampus may lead to disinhibited amygdala function without p-tau elevation in the amygdala itself. They also suggest an association linking blast injury with tauopathy, which has implications for understanding the relationship of chronic blast-related neurobehavioral syndromes in humans to neurodegenerative diseases."
"Pain is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), with current limited knowledge of its pathophysiology. Here, we show that peripheral inoculation of mouse alpha-synuclein (&#x3b1;-Syn) pre-formed fibrils, in a transgenic mouse model of PD, elicited retrograde trans-synaptic spreading of &#x3b1;-Syn pathology (pSer129) across sensory neurons and dorsal nerve roots, reaching central pain processing regions, including the spinal dorsal horn and the projections of the anterolateral system in the central nervous system (CNS). Pathological peripheral to CNS propagation of &#x3b1;-Syn aggregates along interconnected neuronal populations within sensory afferents, was concomitant with impaired nociceptive response, reflected by mechanical allodynia, reduced nerve conduction velocities (sensory and motor) and degeneration of small- and medium-sized myelinated fibers. Our findings show a link between the transneuronal propagation of &#x3b1;-Syn pathology with sensory neuron dysfunction and neuropathic impairment, suggesting promising avenues of investigation into the mechanisms underlying pain in PD."
"Peripheral biomarkers indicative of brain pathology are critically needed for early detection of Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, using NanoString and digital PCR technologies, we began by screening for alterations in genes associated with PD or atypical Parkinsonism in erythrocytes of PD patients, in which PD-related changes have been reported, and which contain&#x2009;~&#x2009;99% of blood &#x3b1;-synuclein. Erythrocytic CHCHD2 mRNA was significantly reduced even at the early stages of the disease. A significant reduction in protein and/or mRNA expression of CHCHD2 was confirmed in PD brains collected at autopsy as well as in the brains of a PD animal model overexpressing &#x3b1;-synuclein, in addition to seeing a reduction of CHCHD2 in erythrocytes of the same animals. Overexpression of &#x3b1;-synuclein in cellular models of PD also resulted in reduced CHCHD2, via mechanisms likely involving altered subcellular localization of p300 histone acetyltransferase. Finally, the utility of reduced CHCHD2 mRNA as a biomarker for detecting PD, including early-stage PD, was validated in a larger cohort of 205 PD patients and 135 normal controls, with a receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrating &gt;&#x2009;80% sensitivity and specificity."
"MGMT-promoter methylation is associated with favorable outcome in glioblastoma. The aim of this study was to determine whether the absolute number of methylated Cytosine-Guanine-dinucleotide-(CpG-)sites within the DMR-2 island of the MGMT-promoter may correlate with outcome in a qualitative or quantitative fashion. In a cohort of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients treated with stereotactic biopsy or open tumor resection plus concomitant chemoradiotherapy, we assessed MGMT-promoter methylation by methylation-specific polymerase-chain-reaction (MSP). Methylation of the CpG-sites 74-98 within the MGMT-promoter region was additionally analysed by Sanger sequencing, and the total number of methylated CpG-sites was correlated with outcome using proportional hazards models. 215 patients with glioblastoma were identified and stratified per MSP (positive: 53%, negative: 47%). Among MSP-positive tumors, hierarchical clustering identified three subgroups with different methylation rates (median: 80% vs. 52% vs. 47%), indicating a site-dependent methylation propagation. The methylation status of a given CpG-site indicated a neighborhood-dependent methylation propagation. Survival was linearly associated with the cumulative number of methylated CpG-sites. This was particularly true in patients who received at least one adjuvant cycle of temozolomide. Notably, all CpG-sites analyzed contributed similarly to effect size; this enabled a further predictive substratification of MSP-positive tumors with median OS ranging from as low as 17.1&#xa0;months (&lt;&#x2009;18 methylated CpG-sites) to as high as 26.2&#xa0;months (&#x2265;&#x2009;18 methylated CpG-sites) in the overall cohort. All in all, total number of methylated CpG-sites may correlate with outcome in a linear fashion. Such analysis may therefore add further predictive value to conventional methods of determining the MGMT-promoter status."
"Recurrent C11orf95-RELA fusions (RELA<sup>FUS</sup>) are the hallmark of supratentorial ependymomas. The presence of RELA as the fusion partner indicates a close association of aberrant NF-&#x3ba;B activity with tumorigenesis. However, the oncogenic role of the C11orf95 has not been determined. Here, we performed ChIP-seq analyses to explore genomic regions bound by RELA<sup>FUS</sup> and H3K27ac proteins in human 293T and mouse ependymoma cells. We then utilized published RNA-Seq data from human and mouse RELA<sup>FUS</sup> tumors and identified target genes that were directly regulated by RELA<sup>FUS</sup> in these tumors. Subsequent transcription factor motif analyses of RELA<sup>FUS</sup> target genes detected a unique GC-rich motif recognized by the C11orf95 moiety, that is present in approximately half of RELA<sup>FUS</sup> target genes. Luciferase assays confirmed that a promoter carrying this motif is sufficient to drive RELA<sup>FUS</sup>-dependent gene expression. Further, the RELA<sup>FUS</sup> target genes were found to be overlapped with Rela target genes primarily via non-canonical NF-&#x3ba;B binding sites. Using a series of truncation and substitution mutants of RELA<sup>FUS</sup>, we also show that the activation domain in the RELA<sup>FUS</sup> moiety is necessary for the regulation of gene expression of these RELA<sup>FUS</sup> target genes. Lastly, we performed an anti-cancer drug screening with mouse ependymoma cells and identified potential anti-ependymoma drugs that are related to the oncogenic mechanism of RELA<sup>FUS</sup>. These findings suggested that RELA<sup>FUS</sup> might induce ependymoma formation through oncogenic pathways orchestrated by both C11orf95 and RELA target genes. Thus, our study unveils a complex gene function of RELA<sup>FUS</sup> as an oncogenic transcription factor in RELA<sup>FUS</sup> positive ependymomas."
"Alpha-synuclein (&#x3b1;-syn) aggregation is the hallmark pathological lesion in brains of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and related neurological disorders characterized as synucleinopathies. Accumulating evidence now indicates that &#x3b1;-syn deposition is also present within the gut and other peripheral organs outside the central nervous system (CNS). In the current study, we demonstrate for the first time that &#x3b1;-syn pathology also accumulates within the liver, the main organ responsible for substance&#xa0;clearance and detoxification. We further demonstrate that cultured human hepatocytes readily internalize oligomeric &#x3b1;-syn assemblies mediated, at least in part, by the gap junction protein connexin-32 (Cx32). Moreover, we identified a time-dependent accumulation of &#x3b1;-syn within the liver of three different transgenic (tg)&#xa0;mouse models expressing human &#x3b1;-syn under CNS-specific promoters, despite the lack of &#x3b1;-syn mRNA expression within the liver. Such a brain-to-liver transmission route could be further corroborated by detection of &#x3b1;-syn pathology within the liver of wild type mice one month after a single striatal &#x3b1;-syn injection. In contrast to the synucleinopathy models, aged mice modeling AD rarely show any amyloid-beta (A&#xdf;) deposition within the liver. In human post-mortem liver tissue, we identified cases with neuropathologically confirmed &#x3b1;-syn pathology containing &#x3b1;-syn within hepatocellular structures to a higher degree (75%) than control subjects without &#x3b1;-syn accumulation in the brain (57%). Our results reveal that &#x3b1;-syn accumulates within the liver and may be derived from the brain or other peripheral sources. Collectively, our findings indicate that the liver may play a role in the clearance and detoxification of pathological proteins in PD and related synucleinopathies."
"The influence of the gut microbiota on traumatic brain injury (TBI) is presently unknown. This knowledge gap is of paramount clinical significance as TBI patients are highly susceptible to alterations in the gut microbiota by antibiotic exposure. Antibiotic-induced gut microbial dysbiosis established prior to TBI significantly worsened neuronal loss and reduced microglia activation in the injured hippocampus with concomitant changes in fear memory response. Importantly, antibiotic exposure for 1&#xa0;week after TBI reduced cortical infiltration of Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes, increased microglial pro-inflammatory markers, and decreased T lymphocyte infiltration, which persisted through 1&#xa0;month post-injury. Moreover, microbial dysbiosis was associated with reduced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus 1&#xa0;week after TBI. By 3&#xa0;months after injury (11&#xa0;weeks after discontinuation of the antibiotics), we observed increased microglial proliferation, increased hippocampal neuronal loss, and modulation of fear memory response. These data demonstrate that antibiotic-induced gut microbial dysbiosis after TBI impacts neuroinflammation, neurogenesis, and fear memory and implicate gut microbial modulation as a potential therapeutic intervention for TBI."
"SORL1 is strongly associated with both sporadic and familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but a lack of information about alternatively spliced transcripts currently limits our understanding of the role of SORL1 in AD. Here, we describe a SORL1 transcript (SORL1-38b) characterized by inclusion of a novel exon (E38b) that encodes a truncated protein. We identified E38b-containing transcripts in several brain regions, with the highest expression in the cerebellum and showed that SORL1-38b is largely located in neuronal dendrites, which is in contrast to the somatic distribution of transcripts encoding the full-length SORLA protein (SORL1-fl). SORL1-38b transcript levels were significantly reduced in AD cerebellum in three independent cohorts of postmortem brains, whereas no changes were observed for SORL1-fl. A trend of lower 38b transcript level in cerebellum was found for individuals carrying the risk variant at rs2282649 (known as SNP24), although not reaching statistical significance. These findings suggest synaptic functions for SORL1-38b in the brain, uncovering novel aspects of SORL1 that can be further explored in AD research."
"A fundamental property of infectious agents is their particulate nature: infectivity arises from independently-acting particles rather than as a result of collective action. Assemblies of the protein tau can exhibit seeding behaviour, potentially underlying the apparent spread of tau aggregation in many neurodegenerative diseases. Here we ask whether tau assemblies share with classical pathogens the characteristic of particulate behaviour. We used organotypic hippocampal slice cultures from P301S tau transgenic mice in order to precisely control the concentration of extracellular tau assemblies in neural tissue. Whilst untreated slices displayed no overt signs of pathology, exposure to recombinant tau assemblies could result in the formation of intraneuronal, hyperphosphorylated tau structures. However, seeding ability of tau assemblies did not titrate in a one-hit manner in neural tissue. The results suggest that seeding behaviour of tau arises at high concentrations, with implications for the interpretation of high-dose intracranial challenge experiments and the possible contribution of seeded aggregation to human disease."
"Excessive amounts of amyloid &#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) peptide have been suggested to dysregulate synaptic transmission in Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a major type of glial cell in the mammalian brain, astrocytes regulate neuronal function and undergo activity alterations upon A&#x3b2; exposure. Yet the mechanistic steps underlying astrocytic responses to A&#x3b2; peptide remain to be elucidated. Here by fluorescence imaging of signaling pathways, we dissected astrocytic responses to A&#x3b2;25-35 peptide, a neurotoxic A&#x3b2; fragment present in AD patients. In native health astrocytes, A&#x3b2;25-35 evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations via purinergic receptors, being also dependent on the opening of connexin (CX) hemichannels. A&#x3b2;25-35, however, induced a Ca<sup>2+</sup> diminution in A&#x3b2;-preconditioned astrocytes as a result of the potentiation of the plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (PMCA). The PMCA and CX protein expression was observed with immunostaining in the brain tissue of hAPPJ20 AD mouse model. We also observed both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent glutamate release upon astrocytic A&#x3b2; exposure, with the former mediated by CX hemichannel and the latter by both anion channels and lysosome exocytosis. Our results suggest that A&#x3b2; peptide causes state-dependent responses in astrocytes, in association with a multiphasic release of signaling molecules. This study therefore helps to understand astrocyte engagement in AD-related amyloidopathy."
"One of the main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the intraneuronal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau. Passive immunotherapy is a promising strategy for the treatment of AD and there are currently a number of tau-specific monoclonal antibodies in clinical trials. A proposed mechanism of action is to engage and clear extracellular, pathogenic forms of tau. This process has been shown in vitro to be facilitated by microglial phagocytosis through interactions between the antibody-tau complex and microglial Fc-receptors. As this interaction is mediated by the conformation of the antibody's Fc domain, this suggests that the antibody isotype may affect the microglial phagocytosis and clearance of tau, and hence, the overall efficacy of tau antibodies. We therefore aimed to directly compare the efficacy of the tau-specific antibody, RN2N, cloned into a murine IgG1/&#x3ba; framework, which has low affinity Fc-receptor binding, to that cloned into a murine IgG2a/&#x3ba; framework, which has high affinity Fc-receptor binding. Our results demonstrate, for RN2N, that although enhanced microglial activation via the IgG2a/&#x3ba; isotype increased extracellular tau phagocytosis in vitro, the IgG1/&#x3ba; isoform demonstrated enhanced ability to reduce tau pathology and microgliosis following passive immunisation of the P301L tau transgenic pR5 mouse model."
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease in which 97% of patients exhibit cytoplasmic aggregates containing the RNA binding protein TDP-43. Using tagged ribosome affinity purifications in Drosophila models of TDP-43 proteinopathy, we identified TDP-43 dependent translational alterations in motor neurons impacting the spliceosome, pentose phosphate and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. A subset of the mRNAs with altered ribosome association are also enriched in TDP-43 complexes suggesting that they may be direct targets. Among these, dlp mRNA, which encodes the glypican Dally like protein (Dlp)/GPC6, a wingless (Wg/Wnt) signaling regulator is insolubilized both in flies and patient tissues with TDP-43 pathology. While Dlp/GPC6 forms puncta in the Drosophila neuropil and ALS spinal cords, it is reduced at the neuromuscular synapse in flies suggesting compartment specific effects of TDP-43 proteinopathy. These findings together with genetic interaction data show that Dlp/GPC6 is a novel, physiologically relevant target of TDP-43 proteinopathy."
"The most common genetic cause of familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in the C9orf72 gene. While direct molecular hallmarks of the C9orf72 HRE (repeat RNA foci, dipeptide repeat protein pathology) are well characterized, the mechanisms by which the C9orf72 HRE causes ALS and the related neurodegenerative disease frontotemporal dementia (FTD) remain poorly understood. Recently, alterations to the nuclear pore complex and nucleocytoplasmic transport have been accepted as a prominent pathomechanism underlying C9orf72 ALS/FTD. However, global disruptions to nuclear morphology and the nuclear lamina itself remain controversial. Here, we use a large number of induced pluripotent stem cell derived spinal neurons and postmortem human motor cortex sections to thoroughly examine nuclear morphology and nuclear lamina disruptions with light microscopy. In contrast to previous studies in artificial overexpression model systems, endogenous levels of the C9orf72 HRE do not increase the frequency of nuclear lamina invaginations. In addition, the C9orf72 HRE has no impact on overall nuclear shape and size. Notably, the frequency of nuclear Lamin B1 invaginations increases with cellular aging, independent of the C9orf72 HRE. Together, our data suggest that nuclear morphology is unaltered in C9orf72 ALS/FTD."
"Depression is the most common psychiatric comorbidity of epilepsy. However, the molecular pathways underlying this association remain unclear. The NMDA receptor (NMDAR) may play a role in this association, as its downstream signaling has been shown to undergo long-term changes following excitotoxic neuronal damage. To study this pathway, we used an animal model of fluoxetine-resistant epilepsy-associated depression (EAD). We determined the molecular changes associated with the development of depressive symptoms and examined their response to various combinations of fluoxetine and a selective neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole (NI).&#xa0;Depressive symptoms were determined using the forced swim test. Furthermore, expression and phosphorylation levels of markers in the ERK/CREB/ELK1/BDNF/cFOS pathway were measured to determine the molecular changes associated with these symptoms. Finally, oxidative stress markers were measured to more clearly determine the individual contributions of each treatment. While chronic fluoxetine (Flxc) and NI were ineffective alone, their combination had a statistically significant synergistic effect in reducing depressive symptoms. The development of depressive symptoms in epileptic rats was associated with the downregulation of ERK2 expression and ELK1 and CREB phosphorylation. These changes were exactly reversed upon Flxc&#x2009;+&#x2009;NI treatment, which led to increased BDNF and cFOS expression as well. Interestingly, ERK1 did not seem to play a role in these experiments. NI seemed to have augmented Flxc's antidepressant activity by reducing oxidative stress. Our findings suggest NMDAR signaling alterations are a major contributor to EAD development and a potential target for treating conditions associated with underlying excitotoxic neuronal damage."
"Amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) misfolding is one of the hallmark pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD can manifest with diverse symptomatology including variable rates of cognitive decline, duration of clinical disease, and other detrimental changes. Several reports suggest that conformational diversity in misfolded A&#x3b2; is a leading factor for clinical variability in AD, analogous to what it has been described for prion strains in prion diseases. Notably, prion strains generate diverse patterns of misfolded protein deposition in the brains of affected individuals. Here, we tested the in vivo prion-like transmission features of four AD brains displaying particular patterns of amyloidosis. AD brains induced different phenotypes in recipient mice, as evaluated by their specific seeding activity, as well as the total amount of A&#x3b2; deposited surrounding vascular structures and the reactivity of amyloid pathology to thioflavin S. Our results support the notion that AD-subtypes are encoded in disease-associated A&#x3b2;. Further research exploring whether AD include a spectrum of different clinical conditions or syndromes may pave the way to personalized diagnosis and treatments."
"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and deadliest of the primary brain tumors, characterized by malignant growth, invasion into the brain parenchyma, and resistance to therapy. GBM is a heterogeneous disease characterized by high degrees of both inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity. Another layer of complexity arises from the unique brain microenvironment in which GBM develops and grows. The GBM microenvironment consists of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells. The most abundant non-neoplastic cells are those of the innate immune system, called tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs constitute up to 40% of the tumor mass and consist of both brain-resident microglia and bone marrow-derived myeloid cells from the periphery. Although genetically stable, TAMs can change their expression profiles based upon the signals that they receive from tumor cells; therefore, heterogeneity in GBM creates heterogeneity in TAMs. By interacting with tumor cells and with the other non-neoplastic cells in the tumor microenvironment, TAMs promote tumor progression. Here, we review the origin, heterogeneity, and functional roles of TAMs. In addition, we discuss the prospects of therapeutically targeting TAMs alone or in combination with standard or newly-emerging GBM targeting therapies."
"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) causes a spectrum of clinical presentations of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), including progressive changes in behavior, personality, executive function, and language. Up to 20% of familial FTLD cases are caused by progranulin (GRN) haploinsufficiency (FTD-GRN), with one of&#xa0;the most common causal variant being a nonsense mutation at arginine 493 (R493X). Recently, a genetic knockin FTD-GRN mouse model was generated bearing this Grn<sup>R493X</sup> mutation, at the analogous arginine in murine Grn. Aged, homozygous Grn<sup>R493X</sup> mice (Grn<sup>R493X/R493X</sup>) have been shown to phenotypically replicate several neuropathological hallmarks previously demonstrated in Grn null mice. We conducted a comprehensive neuropathological and behavioral assessment of 18&#xa0;month old Grn<sup>R493X/R493X</sup> mice, observing a striking lysosomal dysfunction and thalamic neurodegeneration not previously described in this model, as well as a male-specific increase in generalized anxiety. These findings provide additional phenotypic markers of pathogenesis in aged Grn<sup>R493X/R493X</sup> mice that will contribute to better defining mechanisms underlying FTD-GRN, and offer relevant outcome measures for preclinical efficacy testing of novel therapeutics that target nonsense mutations leading to this devastating disease."
"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of long-term disability in young adults. An evidence-based treatment for TBI recovery, especially in the chronic phase, is not yet available. Using a severe TBI mouse model, we demonstrate that the neurorestorative efficacy of repeated treatments with stem cell factor (SCF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (SCF&#x2009;+&#x2009;G-CSF) in the chronic phase is superior to SCF&#x2009;+&#x2009;G-CSF single treatment. SCF&#x2009;+&#x2009;G-CSF treatment initiated at 3&#xa0;months post-TBI enhances contralesional corticospinal tract sprouting into the denervated side of the cervical spinal cord and re-balances the TBI-induced overgrown synapses in the hippocampus by enhancing microglial function of synaptic pruning. These neurorestorative changes are associated with SCF&#x2009;+&#x2009;G-CSF-improved somatosensory-motor function and spatial learning. In the chronic phase of TBI, severe TBI-caused microglial degeneration in the cortex and hippocampus is ameliorated by SCF&#x2009;+&#x2009;G-CSF treatment. These findings reveal the therapeutic potential and possible mechanism of SCF&#x2009;+&#x2009;G-CSF treatment in brain repair during the chronic phase of severe TBI."
"We have previously reported long-term changes in the brains of non-concussed varsity rugby players using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic imaging (fMRI). Others have reported cognitive deficits in contact sport athletes that have not met the diagnostic criteria for concussion. These results suggest that repetitive mild traumatic brain injuries (rmTBIs) that are not severe enough to meet the diagnostic threshold for concussion, produce long-term consequences. We sought to characterize the neuroimaging, cognitive, pathological and metabolomic changes in a mouse model of rmTBI. Using a closed-skull model of mTBI that when scaled to human leads to rotational and linear accelerations far below what has been reported for sports concussion athletes, we found that 5 daily mTBIs triggered two temporally distinct types of pathological changes. First, during the first days and weeks after injury, the rmTBI produced diffuse axonal injury, a transient inflammatory response and changes in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that resolved with time. Second, the rmTBI led to pathological changes that were evident months after the injury including: changes in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), altered levels of synaptic proteins, behavioural deficits in attention and spatial memory, accumulations of pathologically phosphorylated tau, altered blood metabolomic profiles and white matter ultrastructural abnormalities. These results indicate that exceedingly mild rmTBI, in mice, triggers processes with pathological consequences observable months after the initial injury."
"Prion diseases are fatal, infectious, and incurable neurodegenerative disorders caused by misfolding of the cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) into the infectious isoform (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>). In humans, there are sporadic, genetic and infectious etiologies, with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) being the most common form. Currently, no treatment is available for prion diseases. Cellular cholesterol is known to impact prion conversion, which in turn results in an accumulation of cholesterol in prion-infected neurons. The major elimination of brain cholesterol is achieved by the brain specific enzyme, cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1). Cyp46A1 converts cholesterol into 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, a membrane-permeable molecule that exits the brain. We have demonstrated for the first time that Cyp46A1 levels are reduced in the brains of prion-infected mice at advanced disease stage, in prion-infected neuronal cells and in post-mortem brains of sCJD patients. We have employed the Cyp46A1 activator efavirenz (EFV) for treatment of prion-infected neuronal cells and mice. EFV is an FDA approved anti-HIV medication effectively crossing the blood brain barrier and has been used for decades to chronically treat HIV patients. EFV significantly mitigated PrP<sup>Sc</sup> propagation in prion-infected cells while preserving physiological PrP<sup>C</sup> and lipid raft integrity. Notably, oral administration of EFV treatment chronically at very low dosage starting weeks to months after intracerebral prion inoculation of mice significantly prolonged the lifespan of animals. In summary, our results suggest that Cyp46A1 as a novel therapeutic target and that its activation through repurposing the anti-retroviral medication EFV might be valuable treatment approach for prion diseases."
"One of the most prominent features of glioblastoma (GBM) is hyper-vascularization. Bone marrow-derived macrophages are actively recruited to the tumor and referred to as glioma-associated macrophages (GAMs) which are thought to provide a critical role in tumor neo-vascularization. However, the mechanisms by which GAMs regulate endothelial cells (ECs) in the process of tumor vascularization and response to anti-angiogenic therapy (AATx) is not well-understood. Here we show that GBM cells secrete IL-8 and CCL2 which stimulate GAMs to produce TNF&#x3b1;. Subsequently, TNF&#x3b1; induces a distinct gene expression signature of activated ECs including VCAM-1, ICAM-1, CXCL5, and CXCL10. Inhibition of TNF&#x3b1; blocks GAM-induced EC activation both in vitro and in vivo and improve survival in mouse glioma models. Importantly we show that high TNF&#x3b1; expression predicts worse response to Bevacizumab in GBM patients. We further demonstrated in mouse model that treatment with B20.4.1.1, the mouse analog of Bevacizumab, increased macrophage recruitment to the tumor area and correlated with upregulated TNF&#x3b1; expression in GAMs and increased EC activation, which may be responsible for the failure of AATx in GBMs. These results suggest TNF&#x3b1; is a novel therapeutic that may reverse resistance to AATx. Future clinical studies should be aimed at inhibiting TNF&#x3b1; as a concurrent therapy in GBMs."
"Retinoblastoma is a childhood cancer of the retina involving germline or somatic alterations of the RB Transcriptional Corepressor 1 gene, RB1. Rare cases of sellar-suprasellar region retinoblastoma without evidence of ocular or pineal tumors have been described. A nine-month-old male presented with a sellar-suprasellar region mass. Histopathology showed an embryonal tumor with focal Flexner-Wintersteiner-like rosettes and loss of retinoblastoma protein (RB1) expression by immunohistochemistry. DNA array-based methylation profiling confidently classified the tumor as pineoblastoma group A/intracranial retinoblastoma. The patient was subsequently enrolled on an institutional translational cancer research protocol and underwent comprehensive molecular profiling, including paired tumor/normal exome and genome sequencing and RNA-sequencing of the tumor. Additionally, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) sequencing was performed from comparator normal and disease-involved tissue to resolve complex structural variations. RNA-sequencing revealed multiple fusions clustered within 13q14.1-q21.3, including a novel in-frame fusion of RB1-SIAH3 predicted to prematurely truncate the RB1 protein. SMRT sequencing revealed a complex structural rearrangement spanning 13q14.11-q31.3, including two somatic structural variants within intron 17 of RB1. These events corresponded to the RB1-SIAH3 fusion and a novel RB1 rearrangement expected to correlate with the complete absence of RB1 protein expression. Comprehensive molecular analysis, including DNA array-based methylation profiling and sequencing-based methodologies, were critical for classification and understanding the complex mechanism of RB1 inactivation in this diagnostically challenging tumor."
"Short survival of glioblastoma (GBM) patients is due to systematic tumor recurrence. Our laboratory identified a GBM cell subpopulation able to leave the tumor mass (TM) and invade the subventricular zone (SVZ-GBM cells). SVZ-GBM cells escape treatment and appear to contribute to GBM recurrence. This study aims to identify proteins specifically expressed by SVZ-GBM cells and to define their role(s) in GBM aggressiveness and recurrence. The proteome was compared between GBM cells located in the initial TM and SVZ-GBM cells using mass spectrometry. Among differentially expressed proteins, we confirmed B7-H3 by western blot (WB) and quantitative RT-PCR. B7-H3 expression was compared by immunohistochemistry and WB (including expression of its isoforms) between human GBM (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;14) and non-cancerous brain tissue (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;8), as well as newly diagnosed GBM and patient-matched recurrences (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;11). Finally, the expression of B7-H3 was modulated with short hairpin RNA and/or over-expression vectors to determine its functional role in GBM using in vitro assays and a xenograft mouse model of GBM. B7-H3 was a marker for SVZ-GBM cells. It was also increased in human GBM pericytes, myeloid cells and neoplastic cells. B7-H3 inhibition in GBM cells reduced their tumorigenicity. Out of the two B7-H3 isoforms, only 2IgB7-H3 was detected in non-cancerous brain tissue, whereas 4IgB7-H3 was specific for GBM. 2IgB7-H3 expression was higher in GBM recurrences and increased resistance to temozolomide-mediated apoptosis. To conclude, 4IgB7-H3 is an interesting candidate for GBM targeted therapies, while 2IgB7-H3 could be involved in recurrence through resistance to chemotherapy."
"Transcribed nucleotide repeat expansions form detectable RNA foci in patient cells that contribute to disease pathogenesis. The most widely used method for detecting RNA foci, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), is powerful but can suffer from issues related to signal above background. Here we developed a repeat-specific form of hybridization chain reaction (R-HCR) as an alternative method for detection of repeat RNA foci in two neurodegenerative disorders: C9orf72 associated ALS and frontotemporal dementia (C9 ALS/FTD) and Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. R-HCR to both G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and CGG repeats exhibited comparable specificity but&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;40&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;sensitivity compared to FISH, with better detection of both nuclear and cytoplasmic foci in human C9 ALS/FTD fibroblasts, patient iPSC derived neurons, and patient brain samples. Using R-HCR, we observed that integrated stress response (ISR) activation significantly increased the number of endogenous G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub> repeat RNA foci and triggered their selective nuclear accumulation without evidence of stress granule co-localization in patient fibroblasts and patient derived neurons. These data suggest that R-HCR can be a useful tool for tracking the behavior of repeat expansion mRNA in C9 ALS/FTD and other repeat expansion disorders."
"Prognostic molecular subgrouping of glioblastoma is an ongoing effort and the current classification includes IDH-wild-type and IDH-mutant entities, the latter showing significantly better prognosis. We performed a comparative integrated analysis of the FGFR glioblastoma subgroup consisting of 5 cases from a prospective 101-patient-cohort. FGFR alterations included FGFR2-TACC2 and FGFR2 amplifications arising in a multifocal IDH-mutant glioblastoma with unexpected 2.5-month patient survival, novel FGFR3 carboxy-terminal duplication and FGFR3-TLN1 fusion, and two previously described FGFR3-TACC3 fusions. The FGFR2 tumors showed additional mutations in SERPINE1/PAI-1 and MMP16, as part of extensive extracellular matrix remodeling programs. Whole transcriptomic analysis revealed common proliferation but distinct morphogenetic gene expression programs that correlated with tumor histology. The kinase program revealed EPHA3, LTK and ALK receptor tyrosine kinase overexpression in individual FGFR tumors. Paradoxically, all FGFR-fused glioblastomas shared strong PI3K and MAPK pathway suppression effected by SPRY, DUSP and AKAP12 inhibitors, whereas the FGFR2-TACC2 tumor elicited also EGFR suppression by ERRFI1 upregulation. This integrated analysis outlined the proliferation and morphogenetic expression programs in FGFR glioblastoma, and identified four novel, clinically targetable FGFR2 and FGFR3 alterations that confer aggressive phenotype and trigger canonical pathway feedback inhibition, with important therapeutic implications."
"Huntington's disease (HD) is a late onset, inherited neurodegenerative disorder for which early pathogenic events remain poorly understood. Here we show that mutant exon 1 HTT proteins are recruited to a subset of cytoplasmic aggregates in the cell bodies of neurons in brain sections from presymptomatic HD, but not wild-type, mice. This occurred in a disease stage and polyglutamine-length dependent manner. We successfully adapted a high-resolution correlative light and electron microscopy methodology, originally developed for mammalian and yeast cells, to allow us to correlate light microscopy and electron microscopy images on the same brain section within an accuracy of 100&#xa0;nm. Using this approach, we identified these recruitment sites as single membrane bound, vesicle-rich endolysosomal organelles, specifically as (1) multivesicular bodies (MVBs), or amphisomes and (2) autolysosomes or residual bodies. The organelles were often found in close-proximity to phagophore-like structures. Immunogold labeling localized mutant HTT to non-fibrillar, electron lucent structures within the lumen of these organelles. In presymptomatic HD, the recruitment organelles were predominantly MVBs/amphisomes, whereas in late-stage HD, there were more autolysosomes or residual bodies. Electron tomograms indicated the fusion of small vesicles with the vacuole within the lumen, suggesting that MVBs develop into residual bodies. We found that markers of MVB-related exocytosis were depleted in presymptomatic mice and throughout the disease course. This suggests that endolysosomal homeostasis has moved away from exocytosis toward lysosome fusion and degradation, in response to the need to clear the chronically aggregating mutant HTT protein, and that this occurs at an early stage in HD pathogenesis."
"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an insidious middle age-onset neurodegenerative disease that clinically presents with variable degrees of parkinsonism and cerebellar ataxia. The pathological hallmark of MSA is the progressive accumulation of glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in oligodendrocytes that are comprised of &#x3b1;-synuclein (&#x3b1;Syn) aberrantly polymerized into fibrils. Experimentally, MSA brain samples display a high level of seeding activity to induce further &#x3b1;Syn aggregation by a prion-like conformational mechanism. Paradoxically, &#x3b1;Syn is predominantly a neuronal brain protein, with only marginal levels expressed in normal or diseased oligodendrocytes, and &#x3b1;Syn inclusions in other neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Dementia with Lewy bodies, are primarily found in neurons. Although GCIs are the hallmark of MSA, using a series of new monoclonal antibodies targeting the carboxy-terminal region of &#x3b1;Syn, we demonstrate that neuronal &#x3b1;Syn pathology in MSA patient brains is remarkably abundant in the pontine nuclei and medullary inferior olivary nucleus. This neuronal &#x3b1;Syn pathology has distinct histological properties compared to GCIs, which allows it to remain concealed to many routine detection methods associated with altered biochemical properties of the carboxy-terminal domain of &#x3b1;Syn. We propose that these previously underappreciated sources of aberrant &#x3b1;Syn could serve as a pool of &#x3b1;Syn prion seeds that can initiate and continue to drive the pathogenesis of MSA."
"The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a type I transmembrane protein with unknown physiological function but potential impact in neurodegeneration. The current study demonstrates that APP signals to the nucleus causing the generation of aggregates consisting of its adapter protein FE65, the histone acetyltransferase TIP60 and the tumour suppressor proteins p53 and PML. APP C-terminal (APP-CT50) complexes co-localize and co-precipitate with p53 and PML. The PML nuclear body generation is induced and fusion occurs over time depending on APP signalling and STED imaging revealed active gene expression within the complex. We further show that the nuclear aggregates of APP-CT50 fragments together with PML and FE65 are present in the aged human brain but not in cerebral organoids differentiated from iPS cells. Notably, human Alzheimer's disease brains reveal a highly significant reduction of these nuclear aggregates in areas with high plaque load compared to plaque-free areas of the same individual. Based on these results we conclude that APP-CT50 signalling to the nucleus takes place in the aged human brain and is involved in the pathophysiology of AD."
"Sex is an important factor that contributes to the clinical and biological heterogeneities in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the regulatory mechanisms underlying sex disparity in AD are still not well understood. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that regulates gene transcription and is known to be involved in AD. We performed the first large-scale sex-specific meta-analysis of DNA methylation differences in AD neuropathology, by re-analyzing four recent epigenome-wide association studies totaling more than 1000 postmortem prefrontal cortex brain samples using a uniform analytical pipeline. For each cohort, we employed two complementary analytical strategies, a sex-stratified analysis that examined methylation-Braak stage associations in male and female samples separately, and a sex-by-Braak stage interaction analysis that compared the magnitude of these associations between different sexes. Our analysis uncovered 14 novel CpGs, mapped to genes such as TMEM39A and TNXB that are associated with the AD Braak stage in a sex-specific manner. TMEM39A is known to be involved in inflammation, dysregulated type I interferon responses, and other immune processes. TNXB encodes tenascin proteins, which are extracellular matrix glycoproteins demonstrated to modulate synaptic plasticity in the brain. Moreover, for many previously implicated genes in AD neuropathology, such as MBP and AZU1, our analysis provided the new insights that they were predominately driven by effects in only one sex. These sex-specific DNA methylation differences were enriched in divergent biological processes such as integrin activation in females and complement activation in males. Our study implicated multiple new loci and biological processes that affected AD neuropathology in a sex-specific manner."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of age-related dementia. Increasing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation mediated by microglia and astrocytes contributes to disease progression and severity in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. During AD progression, resident microglia undergo proinflammatory activation, resulting in an increased capacity to convert resting astrocytes to reactive astrocytes. Therefore, microglia are a major therapeutic target for AD and blocking microglia-astrocyte activation could limit neurodegeneration in AD. Here we report that NLY01, an engineered exedin-4, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, selectively blocks &#x3b2;-amyloid (A&#x3b2;)-induced activation of microglia through GLP-1R activation and inhibits the formation of reactive astrocytes as well as preserves neurons in AD models. In two transgenic AD mouse models (5xFAD and 3xTg-AD), repeated subcutaneous administration of NLY01 blocked microglia-mediated reactive astrocyte conversion and preserved neuronal viability, resulting in improved spatial learning and memory. Our study indicates that the GLP-1 pathway plays a critical role in microglia-reactive astrocyte associated neuroinflammation in AD and the effects of NLY01 are primarily mediated through a direct action on A&#x3b2;-induced GLP-1R<sup>+</sup> microglia, contributing to the inhibition of astrocyte reactivity. These results show that targeting upregulated GLP-1R in microglia is a viable therapy for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders."
"Chorea-Acanthocytosis (ChAc) is a devastating, little understood, and currently untreatable neurodegenerative disease caused by VPS13A mutations. Based on our recent demonstration that accumulation of activated Lyn tyrosine kinase is a key pathophysiological event in human ChAc cells, we took advantage of Vps13a<sup>-/-</sup> mice, which phenocopied human ChAc. Using proteomic approach, we found accumulation of active Lyn, &#x3b3;-synuclein and phospho-tau proteins in Vps13a<sup>-/-</sup> basal ganglia secondary to impaired autophagy leading to neuroinflammation. Mice double knockout Vps13a<sup>-/-</sup> Lyn<sup>-/-</sup> showed normalization of red cell morphology and improvement of autophagy in basal ganglia. We then in vivo tested pharmacologic inhibitors of Lyn: dasatinib and nilotinib. Dasatinib failed to cross the mouse brain blood barrier (BBB), but the more specific Lyn kinase inhibitor nilotinib, crosses the BBB. Nilotinib ameliorates both Vps13a<sup>-/-</sup> hematological and neurological phenotypes, improving autophagy and preventing neuroinflammation. Our data support the proposal to repurpose nilotinib as new therapeutic option for ChAc patients."
"Defective amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) clearance from the brain is a major contributing factor to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A&#x3b2; clearance is mediated by macrophages, enzymatic degradation, perivascular drainage along the vascular basement membrane (VBM) and transcytosis across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). AD pathology is typically associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy due to perivascular accumulation of A&#x3b2;. Heparan sulfate (HS) is an important component of the VBM, thought to fulfill multiple roles in AD pathology. We previously showed that macrophage-mediated clearance of intracortically injected A&#x3b2; was impaired in the brains of transgenic mice overexpressing heparanase (Hpa-tg). This study revealed that perivascular drainage was impeded in the Hpa-tg brain, evidenced by perivascular accumulation of the injected A&#x3b2; in the thalamus of Hpa-tg mice. Furthermore, endogenous A&#x3b2; accumulated at the perivasculature of Hpa-tg thalamus, but not in control thalamus. This perivascular clearance defect was confirmed following intracortical injection of dextran that was largely retained in the perivasculature of Hpa-tg brains, compared to control brains. Hpa-tg brains presented with thicker VBMs and swollen perivascular astrocyte endfeet, as well as elevated expression of the BBB-associated water-pump protein aquaporin 4 (AQP4). Elevated levels of both heparanase and AQP4 were also detected in human AD brain. These findings indicate that elevated heparanase levels alter the organization and composition of the BBB, likely through increased fragmentation of BBB-associated HS, resulting in defective perivascular drainage. This defect contributes to perivascular accumulation of A&#x3b2; in the Hpa-tg brain, highlighting a potential role for heparanase in the pathogenesis of AD."
"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), a rare pediatric brain tumor, afflicts approximately 350 new patients each year in the United States. DIPG is noted for its lethality, as fewer than 1% of patients survive to five years. Multiple clinical trials involving chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or targeted therapy have all failed to improve clinical outcomes. Recently, high-throughput sequencing of a cohort of DIPG samples identified potential therapeutic targets, including interleukin 13 receptor subunit alpha 2 (IL13R&#x3b1;2) which was expressed in multiple tumor samples and comparably absent in normal brain tissue, identifying IL13R&#x3b1;2 as a potential therapeutic target in DIPG. In this work, we investigated the role of IL13R&#x3b1;2 signaling in progression and invasion of DIPG and viability of IL13R&#x3b1;2 as a therapeutic target through the use of immunoconjugate agents. We discovered that IL13R&#x3b1;2 stimulation via canonical ligands demonstrates minimal impact on both the cellular proliferation and cellular invasion of DIPG cells, suggesting IL13R&#x3b1;2 signaling is non-essential for DIPG progression in vitro. However, exposure to an anti-IL13R&#x3b1;2 antibody-drug conjugate demonstrated potent pharmacological response in DIPG cell models both in vitro and ex ovo in a manner strongly associated with IL13R&#x3b1;2 expression, supporting the potential use of targeting IL13R&#x3b1;2 as a DIPG therapy. However, the tested ADC was effective in most but not all cell models, thus selection of the optimal payload will be essential for clinical translation of an anti-IL13R&#x3b1;2 ADC for DIPG."
"Tau protein forms self-replicating assemblies (seeds) that may underlie progression of pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies. Seeding in recombinant protein preparations and brain homogenates has been quantified with ""biosensor"" cell lines that express tau with a disease-associated mutation (P301S) fused to complementary fluorescent proteins. Quantification of induced aggregation in cells that score positive by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is accomplished by cell imaging or flow cytometry. Several groups have reported seeding activity in antemortem cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using various methods, but these findings are not yet widely replicated. To address this question, we created two improved FRET-based biosensor cell lines based on tau expression, termed version 2 low (v2L) and version 2 high (v2H). We determined that v2H cells are&#x2009;~&#x2009;100-fold more sensitive to AD-derived tau seeds than our original lines, and coupled with immunoprecipitation reliably detect seeding from samples containing as little as 100 attomoles of recombinant tau fibrils or&#x2009;~&#x2009;32&#xa0;pg of total protein from AD brain homogenate. We tested antemortem CSF from 11 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of AD, 9 confirmed by validated CSF biomarkers. We used immunoprecipitation coupled with seed detection in v2H cells and detected no tau seeding in any sample. Thus we cannot confirm prior reports of tau seeding activity in the CSF of AD patients. This next generation of ultra-sensitive tau biosensors may nonetheless be useful to the research community to quantify tau pathology as sensitively and specifically as possible."
"V-type immunoglobulin domain-containing suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA) is a negative checkpoint regulator (NCR) that is involved in T-cell quiescence, inhibition of T-cell activation, and in myeloid cells regulates cytokine production, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and tolerance induction. In the central nervous system (CNS), VISTA is expressed by microglia, the resident macrophage of the parenchyma, and expression is decreased during neuroinflammation; however, the function of VISTA in microglia is unknown. Here, we extensively analyzed VISTA expression in different MS lesion stages and characterized the function of VISTA in the CNS by deleting VISTA in microglia. VISTA is differentially expressed in distinct MS lesion stages. In mice, VISTA deletion in Cx3Cr1-expressing cells induced a more amoeboid microglia morphology, indicating an immune-activated phenotype. Expression of genes associated with cell cycle and immune-activation was increased in VISTA KO microglia. In response to LPS and during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), VISTA KO and WT microglia shared similar transcriptional profiles and VISTA deletion did not affect EAE disease progression or microglia responses. VISTA KO in microglia in vitro decreased the uptake of myelin. This study demonstrates that VISTA is involved in microglia function, which likely affects healthy CNS homeostasis and neuroinflammation."
"When injected into genetically modified mice, aggregates of the amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) peptide from the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients or transgenic AD mouse models seed cerebral A&#x3b2; deposition in a prion-like fashion. Within the brain, A&#x3b2; exists as a pool of distinct C-terminal variants with lengths ranging from 37 to 43 amino acids, yet the relative contribution of individual C-terminal A&#x3b2; variants to the seeding behavior of A&#x3b2; aggregates remains unknown. Here, we have investigated the relative seeding activities of A&#x3b2; aggregates composed exclusively of recombinant A&#x3b2;38, A&#x3b2;40, A&#x3b2;42, or A&#x3b2;43. Cerebral A&#x3b2;42 levels were not increased in App<sup>NL-F</sup> knock-in mice injected with A&#x3b2;38 or A&#x3b2;40 aggregates and were only increased in a subset of mice injected with A&#x3b2;42 aggregates. In contrast, significant accumulation of A&#x3b2;42 was observed in the brains of all mice inoculated with A&#x3b2;43 aggregates, and the extent of A&#x3b2;42 induction was comparable to that in mice injected with brain-derived A&#x3b2; seeds. Mice inoculated with A&#x3b2;43 aggregates exhibited a distinct pattern of cerebral A&#x3b2; pathology compared to mice injected with brain-derived A&#x3b2; aggregates, suggesting that recombinant A&#x3b2;43 may polymerize into a unique strain. Our results indicate that aggregates containing longer A&#x3b2; C-terminal variants are more potent inducers of cerebral A&#x3b2; deposition and highlight the potential role of A&#x3b2;43 seeds as a crucial factor in the initial stages of A&#x3b2; pathology in AD."
"In neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and prion diseases, astrocytes acquire disease-associated reactive phenotypes. With growing appreciation of their role in chronic neurodegeneration, the questions whether astrocytes lose their ability to perform homeostatic functions in the reactive states and whether the reactive phenotypes are neurotoxic or neuroprotective remain unsettled. The current work examined region-specific changes in expression of genes, which report on astrocyte physiological functions and their reactive states, in C57Black/6J mice challenged with four prion strains via two inoculation routes. Unexpectedly, strong reverse correlation between the incubation time to the diseases and the degree of astrocyte activation along with disturbance in functional pathways was observed. The animal groups with the most severe astrocyte response and degree of activation showed the most rapid disease progression. The degree of activation tightly intertwined with the global transformation of the homeostatic state, characterized by disturbances in multiple gene sets responsible for normal physiological functions producing a neurotoxic, reactive phenotype as a net result. The neurotoxic reactive phenotype exhibited a universal gene signature regardless of the prion strain. The current work suggests that the degree of astrocyte activation along with the disturbance in their physiological pathways contribute to the faster progression of disease and perhaps even drive prion pathogenesis."
"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes chronic symptoms and increased risk of neurodegeneration. Axons in white matter tracts, such as the corpus callosum (CC), are critical components of neural circuits and particularly vulnerable to TBI. Treatments are needed to protect axons from traumatic injury and mitigate post-traumatic neurodegeneration. SARM1 protein is a central driver of axon degeneration through a conserved molecular pathway. Sarm1-/- mice with knockout (KO) of the Sarm1 gene enable genetic proof-of-concept testing of the SARM1 pathway as a therapeutic target. We evaluated Sarm1 deletion effects after TBI using a concussive model that causes traumatic axonal injury and progresses to CC atrophy at 10 weeks, indicating post-traumatic neurodegeneration. Sarm1 wild-type (WT) mice developed significant CC atrophy that was reduced in Sarm1 KO mice. Ultrastructural classification of pathology of individual axons, using electron microscopy, demonstrated that Sarm1 KO preserved more intact axons and reduced damaged or demyelinated axons. Longitudinal MRI studies in live mice identified significantly reduced CC volume after TBI in Sarm1 WT mice that was attenuated in Sarm1 KO mice. MR diffusion tensor imaging detected reduced fractional anisotropy in both genotypes while axial diffusivity remained higher in Sarm1 KO mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed significant attenuation of CC atrophy, myelin loss, and neuroinflammation in Sarm1 KO mice after TBI. Functionally, Sarm1 KO mice exhibited beneficial effects in motor learning and sleep behavior. Based on these findings, Sarm1 inactivation can protect axons and white matter tracts to improve translational outcomes associated with CC atrophy and post-traumatic neurodegeneration."
"Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, can cause severe eye disease and even blindness in newborns. However, ZIKV-induced retinal lesions have not been studied in a comprehensive way, mechanisms of ZIKV-induced retinal abnormalities are unknown, and no therapeutic intervention is available to treat or minimize the degree of vision loss in patients. Here, we developed a novel mouse model of ZIKV infection to evaluate its impact on retinal structure. ZIKV (20 plaque-forming units) was inoculated into neonatal wild type C57BL/6J mice at postnatal day (P) 0 subcutaneously. Retinas of infected mice and age-matched controls were collected at various ages, and retinal structural alterations were analyzed. We found that ZIKV induced progressive neuronal and vascular damage and retinal inflammation starting from P8. ZIKV-infected retina exhibited dramatically decreased thickness with loss of neurons, initial neovascular tufts followed by vessel dilation and degeneration, increased microglia and leukocyte recruitment and activation, degeneration of astrocyte network and gliosis. The above changes may involve inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated cell apoptosis and necroptosis. Moreover, we evaluated the efficacy of preclinical drugs and the safety of ZIKV vaccine candidate in this mouse model. We found that ZIKV-induced retinal abnormalities could be blocked by a selective flavivirus inhibitor NITD008 and a live-attenuated ZIKV vaccine candidate could potentially induce retinal abnormalities. Overall, we established a novel mouse model and provide a direct causative link between ZIKV and retinal lesion in vivo, which warrants further investigation of the underlying mechanisms of ZIKV-induced retinopathy and the development of effective therapeutics."
"Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the alteration/aggregation of TAU protein, for which there is still no effective treatment. Therefore, new pharmacological targets are being sought, such as elements of the endocannabinoid system (ECS). We analysed the occurrence of changes in the ECS in tauopathies and their implication in the pathogenesis. By integrating gene expression analysis, immunofluorescence, genetic and adeno-associated virus expressing TAU mouse models, we found a TAU-dependent increase in CB<sub>2</sub> receptor expression in hippocampal neurons, that occurs as an early event in the pathology and was maintained until late stages. These changes were accompanied by alterations in the endocannabinoid metabolism. Remarkably, CB<sub>2</sub> ablation in mice protects from neurodegeneration induced by hTAU<sup>P301L</sup> overexpression, corroborated at the level of cognitive behaviour, synaptic plasticity, and aggregates of insoluble TAU. At the level of neuroinflammation, the absence of CB<sub>2</sub> did not produce significant changes in concordance with a possible neuronal location rather than its classic glial expression in these models. These findings were corroborated in post-mortem samples of patients with Alzheimer's disease, the most common tauopathy. Our results show that neurons with accumulated TAU induce the expression of the CB<sub>2</sub> receptor, which enhances neurodegeneration. These results are important for our understanding of disease mechanisms, providing a novel therapeutic strategy to be investigated in tauopathies."
"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) contributes to accelerated cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and is a common finding at autopsy. The APOE&#x3b5;4 allele and male sex have previously been reported to associate with increased CAA in AD. To inform biomarker and therapeutic target discovery, we aimed to identify additional genetic risk factors and biological pathways involved in this vascular component of AD etiology. We present a genome-wide association study of CAA pathology in AD cases and report sex- and APOE-stratified assessment of this phenotype. Genome-wide genotypes were collected from 853 neuropathology-confirmed AD cases scored for CAA across five brain regions, and imputed to the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel. Key variables and genome-wide genotypes were tested for association with CAA in all individuals and in sex and APOE&#x3b5;4 stratified subsets. Pathway enrichment was run for each of the genetic analyses. Implicated loci were further investigated for functional consequences using brain transcriptome data from 1,186 samples representing seven brain regions profiled as part of the AMP-AD consortium. We confirmed association of male sex, AD neuropathology and APOE&#x3b5;4 with increased CAA, and identified a novel locus, LINC-PINT, associated with lower CAA amongst APOE&#x3b5;4-negative individuals (rs10234094-C, beta&#x2009;=&#x2009;-3.70 [95% CI -0.49--0.24]; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.63E-08). Transcriptome profiling revealed higher LINC-PINT expression levels in AD cases, and association of rs10234094-C with altered LINC-PINT splicing. Pathway analysis indicates variation in genes involved in neuronal health and function are linked to CAA in AD patients. Further studies in additional and diverse cohorts are needed to assess broader translation of our findings."
"Fluorescent staining of newly transcribed RNA via metabolic labelling with 5-ethynyluridine (EU) and click chemistry enables visualisation of changes in transcription, such as in conditions of cellular stress. Here, we tested whether EU labelling can be used to examine transcription in vivo in mouse models of nervous system disorders. We show that injection of EU directly into the cerebellum results in reproducible labelling of newly transcribed RNA in cerebellar neurons and glia, with cell type-specific differences in relative labelling intensities, such as Purkinje cells exhibiting the highest levels. We also observed EU-labelling accumulating into cytoplasmic inclusions, indicating that EU, like other modified uridines, may introduce non-physiological properties in labelled RNAs. Additionally, we found that EU induces Purkinje cell degeneration nine days after EU injection, suggesting that EU incorporation not only results in abnormal RNA transcripts, but also eventually becomes neurotoxic in highly transcriptionally-active neurons. However, short post-injection intervals of EU labelling in both a Purkinje cell-specific DNA repair-deficient mouse model and a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia 1 revealed reduced transcription in Purkinje cells compared to controls. We combined EU labelling with immunohistology to correlate altered EU staining with pathological markers, such as genotoxic signalling factors. These data indicate that the EU-labelling method provided here can be used to identify changes in transcription in vivo in nervous system disease models."
"Pathophysiological changes in dopamine neurons precede their demise and contribute to the early phases of Parkinson's disease (PD). Intracellular pathological inclusions of the protein &#x3b1;-synuclein within dopaminergic neurons are a cardinal feature of PD, but the mechanisms by which &#x3b1;-synuclein contributes to dopaminergic neuron vulnerability remain unknown. The inaccessibility to diseased tissue has been a limitation in studying progression of pathophysiology prior to degeneration of dopamine neurons. To address these issues, we differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a PD patient carrying the &#x3b1;-synuclein triplication mutation (AST) and an unaffected first-degree relative (NAS) into dopaminergic neurons. In human-like dopamine neurons &#x3b1;-synuclein overexpression reduced the functional availability of D2 receptors, resulting in a stark dysregulation in firing activity, dopamine release, and neuronal morphology. We back-translated these findings into primary mouse neurons overexpressing &#x3b1;-synuclein and found a similar phenotype, supporting the causal role for &#x3b1;-synuclein. Importantly, application of D2 receptor agonist, quinpirole, restored the altered firing activity of AST-derived dopaminergic neurons to normal levels. These results provide novel insights into the pre-degenerative pathophysiological neuro-phenotype induced by &#x3b1;-synuclein overexpression and introduce a potential mechanism for the long-established clinical efficacy of D2 receptor agonists in the treatment of PD."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a sequential progression of amyloid plaques (A), neurofibrillary tangles (T) and neurodegeneration (N), constituting ATN pathology. While microglia are considered key contributors to AD pathogenesis, their contribution in the combined presence of ATN pathologies remains incompletely understood. As sensors of the brain microenvironment, microglial phenotypes and contributions are importantly defined by the pathologies in the brain, indicating the need for their analysis in preclinical models that recapitulate combined ATN pathologies, besides their role in A and T models only. Here, we report a new tau-seed model in which amyloid pathology facilitates bilateral tau propagation associated with brain atrophy, thereby recapitulating robust ATN pathology. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that ATN pathology exacerbated microglial activation towards disease-associated microglia states, with a significant upregulation of Apoe as compared to amyloid-only models (A). Importantly, Colony-Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor inhibition preferentially eliminated non-plaque-associated versus plaque associated microglia. The preferential depletion of non-plaque-associated microglia significantly attenuated tau pathology and neuronal atrophy, indicating their detrimental role during ATN progression. Together, our data reveal the intricacies of microglial activation and their contributions to pathology in a model that recapitulates the combined ATN pathologies of AD. Our data may provide a basis for microglia-targeting therapies selectively targeting detrimental microglial populations, while conserving protective populations."
"The blood-brain barrier is a dynamic endothelial cell barrier in the brain microvasculature that separates the blood from the brain parenchyma. Specialized brain endothelial cells, astrocytes, neurons, microglia and pericytes together compose the neurovascular unit and interact to maintain blood-brain barrier function. A disturbed brain barrier function is reported in most common neurological disorders and may play a role in disease pathogenesis. However, a comprehensive overview of how the neurovascular unit is affected in a wide range of rare disorders is lacking. Our aim was to provide further insights into the neuropathology of the neurovascular unit in leukodystrophies to unravel its potential pathogenic role in these diseases. Leukodystrophies are monogenic disorders of the white matter due to defects in any of its structural components. Single leukodystrophies are exceedingly rare, and availability of human tissue is unique. Expression of selective neurovascular unit markers such as claudin-5, zona occludens 1, laminin, PDGFR&#x3b2;, aquaporin-4 and &#x3b1;-dystroglycan was investigated in eight different leukodystrophies using immunohistochemistry. We observed tight junction rearrangements, indicative of endothelial dysfunction, in five out of eight assessed leukodystrophies of different origin and an altered aquaporin-4 distribution in all. Aquaporin-4 redistribution indicates a general astrocytic dysfunction in leukodystrophies, even in those not directly related to astrocytic pathology or without prominent reactive astrogliosis. These findings provide further evidence for dysfunction in the orchestration of the neurovascular unit in leukodystrophies and contribute to a better understanding of the underlying disease mechanism."
"The synthesis of new proteins is a fundamental aspect of cellular life and is required for many neurological processes, including the formation, updating and extinction of long-term memories. Protein synthesis is impaired in neurodegenerative diseases including tauopathies, in which pathology is caused by aberrant changes to the microtubule-associated protein tau. We recently showed that both global de novo protein synthesis and the synthesis of select ribosomal proteins (RPs) are decreased in mouse models of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) which express mutant forms of tau. However, a comprehensive analysis of the effect of FTD-mutant tau on ribosomes is lacking. Here we used polysome profiling, de novo protein labelling and mass spectrometry-based proteomics to examine how ribosomes are altered in models of FTD. We identified 10 RPs which were decreased in abundance in primary neurons taken from the K3 mouse model of FTD. We further demonstrate that expression of human tau (hTau) decreases both protein synthesis and biogenesis of the 60S ribosomal subunit, with these effects being exacerbated in the presence of FTD-associated tau mutations. Lastly, we demonstrate that expression of the amino-terminal projection domain of hTau is sufficient to reduce protein synthesis and ribosomal biogenesis. Together, these data reinforce a role for tau in impairing ribosomal function."
"Circumstantial evidence points to a pathological role of alpha-synuclein (aSyn; gene symbol SNCA), conferred by aSyn misfolding and aggregation, in Parkinson disease (PD) and related synucleinopathies. Several findings in experimental models implicate perturbations in the tissue homeostatic mechanisms triggered by pathological aSyn accumulation, including impaired redox homeostasis, as significant contributors in the pathogenesis of PD. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NRF2/Nrf2) is recognized as 'the master regulator of cellular anti-oxidant response', both under physiological as well as in pathological conditions. Using immunohistochemical analyses, we show a robust nuclear NRF2 accumulation in post-mortem PD midbrain, detected by NRF2 phosphorylation on the&#xa0;serine residue 40 (nuclear active p-NRF2, S40). Curated gene expression analyses of four independent publicly available microarray datasets revealed considerable alterations in NRF2-responsive genes in the disease affected regions in PD, including substantia nigra, dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, locus coeruleus and globus pallidus. To further examine the putative role of pathological aSyn accumulation on nuclear NRF2 response, we employed a transgenic mouse model of synucleionopathy (M83 line, expressing the mutant human A53T aSyn), which manifests widespread aSyn pathology (phosphorylated aSyn; S129) in the nervous system following intramuscular inoculation of exogenous fibrillar aSyn. We observed strong immunodetection of nuclear NRF2 in neuronal populations harboring p-aSyn (S129), and found an aberrant anti-oxidant and inflammatory gene response in the affected neuraxis. Taken together, our data support the notion that pathological aSyn accumulation impairs the redox homeostasis in nervous system, and boosting neuronal anti-oxidant response is potentially a promising approach to mitigate neurodegeneration in PD and related diseases."
"Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is an autosomal dominant, rare disorder caused by variants in the genes for voltage-gated calcium channel Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 (CACNA1S) and Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 (SCN4A). Patients with hypokalemic periodic paralysis may suffer from periodic paralysis alone, periodic paralysis co-existing with permanent weakness or permanent weakness alone. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis has been known to be associated with vacuolar myopathy for decades, and that vacuoles are a universal feature regardless of phenotype. Hence, we wanted to investigate the nature and cause of the vacuoles. Fourteen patients with the p.R528H variation in the CACNA1S gene was included in the study. Histology, immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy was used to assess general histopathology, ultrastructure and pattern of expression of proteins related to muscle fibres and autophagy. Western blotting and real-time PCR was used to determine the expression levels of proteins and mRNA of the proteins investigated in immunohistochemistry. Histology and transmission electron microscopy revealed heterogenous vacuoles containing glycogen, fibrils and autophagosomes. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated autophagosomes and endosomes arrested at the pre-lysosome fusion stage. Expression analysis showed a significant decrease in levels of proteins an mRNA involved in autophagy in patients, suggesting a systemic effect. However, activation level of the master regulator of autophagy gene transcription, TFEB, did not differ between patients and controls, suggesting competing control over autophagy gene transcription by nutritional status and calcium concentration, both controlling TFEB activity. The findings suggest that patients with hypokalemic periodic paralysis have disrupted autophagic processing that contribute to the vacuoles seen in these patients."
"Tau pathology is instrumental in the gradual loss of neuronal functions and cognitive decline in tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Earlier reports showed that adenosine metabolism is abnormal in the brain of AD patients while consequences remained ill-defined. Herein, we aimed at investigating whether manipulation of adenosine tone would impact Tau pathology, associated molecular alterations and subsequent neurodegeneration. We demonstrated that treatment with an inhibitor (J4) of equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) exerted beneficial effects in a mouse model of Tauopathy. Treatment with J4 not only reduced Tau hyperphosphorylation but also rescued memory deficits, mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic loss, and abnormal expression of immune-related gene signatures. These beneficial effects were particularly ascribed to the ability of J4 to suppress the overactivation of AMPK (an energy reduction sensor), suggesting that normalization of energy dysfunction mitigates neuronal dysfunctions in Tauopathy. Collectively, these data highlight that targeting adenosine metabolism is a novel strategy for tauopathies."
"Sustained brain chronic inflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) includes glial&#xa0;cell&#xa0;activation,&#xa0;an increase in cytokines and chemokines, and lipid mediators (LMs), concomitant with decreased pro-homeostatic mediators. The inflammatory response at the onset of pathology engages activation of pro-resolving, pro-homeostatic LMs followed by a gradual decrease. We used an APP knock-in (App&#xa0;KI) AD mouse that accumulates&#xa0;&#x3b2;-amyloid (A&#x3b2;)&#xa0;and presents cognitive deficits (at 2 and 6&#xa0;months of age, respectively)&#xa0;to investigate LMs, their precursors, biosynthetic enzymes and receptors, glial activation, and inflammatory proteins in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus at 2-, 4-, 8- and 18-month-old in comparison with wild-type (WT) mice. We used&#xa0;LC-mass-spectrometry and MALDI molecular imaging to analyze LMs and&#xa0;phospholipids, and immunochemistry for proteins. Our results revealed an age-specific lipid and cytokine profile, and glial activation in the App KI mice. Despite an early onset of A&#x3b2; pathology, pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving LMs were prominently increased only in the oldest age group. Furthermore, the LM biosynthetic enzymes increased, and their receptor expression decreased in the aged&#xa0;App&#xa0;KI mice. Arachidonic acid (AA)-containing phospholipid molecular species were elevated, correlating with decreased&#xa0;cPLA2 activity. MALDI molecular imaging depicted differential&#xa0;distribution of phospholipids according to genotype in hippocampal layers. Brain histology disclosed increased microglia proliferation starting from young age in the&#xa0;App&#xa0;KI mice, while astrocyte numbers were enhanced in&#xa0;older ages. Our results demonstrate that the brain lipidome is modified preferentially during aging as compared to amyloid pathology in the model studied here. However, alterations in phospholipids signal&#xa0;early pathological changes in membrane composition."
"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) contribute to radioresistance in medulloblastoma. Thus, identification of key regulators of medulloblastoma stemness is critical for improving radiotherapy for medulloblastoma. In the present study, we profiled CSC-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) between radioresistant and parental medulloblastoma cells. The roles of the lncRNA RBM5-AS1 in the stemness and radiosensitivity of medulloblastoma cells were investigated. We found that RBM5-AS1, a novel inducer of medulloblastoma stemness, was significantly upregulated in radioresistant medulloblastoma cells compared to parental cells. Knockdown of RBM5-AS1 diminished the viability and clonogenic survival of both radioresistant and parental medulloblastoma cells after radiation. Silencing of RBM5-AS1 significantly enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis and DNA damage. In vivo studies confirmed that depletion of RBM5-AS1 inhibited tumor growth and increased radiosensitivity in a medulloblastoma xenograft model. In contrast, overexpression of RBM5-AS1 reduced radiation-induced apoptosis and DNA damage in medulloblastoma cells. Mechanistically, RBM5-AS1 interacted with and stabilized sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) protein. Silencing of SIRT6 reduced the stemness and reinforced radiation-induced DNA damage in medulloblastoma cells. Overexpression of SIRT6 rescued medulloblastoma cells from RBM5-AS1 depletion-induced radiosensitization and DNA damage. Overall, we identify RBM5-AS1 as an inducer of stemness and radioresistance in medulloblastoma. Targeting RBM5-AS1 may represent a potential strategy to overcome the resistance to radiotherapy in this malignancy."
"Several conserved nuclear RNA binding proteins (sut-1, sut-2, and parn-2) control tau aggregation and toxicity in C. elegans, mice, and human cells. MSUT2 protein normally resides in nuclear speckles, membraneless organelles composed of phase-separated RNAs and RNA-binding proteins that mediate critical steps in mRNA processing including mRNA splicing. We used human pathological tissue and transgenic mice to identify Alzheimer's disease-specific cellular changes related to nuclear speckles. We observed that nuclear speckle constituent scaffold protein SRRM2 is mislocalized and accumulates in cytoplasmic lesions in AD brain tissue. Furthermore, progression of tauopathy in transgenic mice is accompanied by increasing mislocalization of SRRM2 from the neuronal nucleus to the soma. In AD brain tissue, SRRM2 mislocalization associates with increased severity of pathological tau deposition. These findings suggest potential mechanisms by which pathological tau impacts nuclear speckle function in diverse organisms ranging from C. elegans to mice to humans. Future translational studies aimed at restoring nuclear speckle homeostasis may provide novel candidate therapeutic targets for pharmacological intervention."
"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary central nervous system (CNS) neoplasm in adults, and has an almost universally poor prognosis. Recently, an emphasis on genetic and epigenetic profiling has revealed a number of molecular features useful in the diagnostic and prognostic classification of GBM, advancing our understanding of the underlying features that make these tumors so aggressive and providing the rationale for the creation of better targeted therapeutics. One such method, DNA methylation profiling, has recently emerged as an important technique for the classification of CNS tumors, with diagnostic accuracy in some cases surpassing traditional methods. However, how DNA methylation profiles change with the course of the disease remains less understood. Here, we present a case of a 30-year-old male with primary IDH-mutant GBM with widespread recurrence and death two years later. Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering of methylation probes, we created a phylogenetic map to trace the tumor path as it spread from the initial biopsy site throughout the right hemisphere, across the corpus callosum to the contralateral hemisphere, and into the brainstem. We identified molecular divergence between the right and left hemisphere GBM samples marked by distinct copy number profile alterations, alterations in specific methylation sites, and regional loss of MGMT promoter methylation, providing a potential mechanism for treatment resistance in this case. In summary, this case both highlights the molecular diversity in GBM, and illustrates a novel use for methylation profiling in establishing a phylogenetic profile to allow for spatial mapping of tumor progression."
"Primary spinal cord astrocytomas are rare, hence few data exist about the prognostic significance of molecular markers. Here we analyze a panel of molecular alterations in association with the clinical course. Histology and genome sequencing was performed in 26 spinal astrocytomas operated upon between 2000 and 2020. Next-generation DNA/RNA sequencing (NGS) and methylome analysis were performed to determine molecular alterations. Histology and NGS allowed the distinction of 5 tumor subgroups: glioblastoma IDH wildtype (GBM); diffuse midline glioma H3 K27M mutated (DMG-H3); high-grade astrocytoma with piloid features (HAP); diffuse astrocytoma IDH mutated (DA), diffuse leptomeningeal glioneural tumors (DGLN) and pilocytic astrocytoma (PA). Within all tumor entities GBM (median OS: 5.5&#xa0;months), DMG-H3 (median OS: 13&#xa0;months) and HAP (median OS: 8&#xa0;months) showed a fatal prognosis. DMG-H3 tend to emerge in adolescence whereas GBM and HAP develop in the elderly. HAP are characterized by CDKN2A/B deletion and ATRX mutation. 50% of PA tumors carried a mutation in the PIK3CA gene which is seemingly associated with better outcome (median OS: PIK3CA mutated 107.5 vs 45.5&#xa0;months in wildtype PA). This exploratory molecular profiling of spinal cord astrocytomas allows to identify distinct subgroups by combining molecular markers and histomorphology. DMG-H3 tend to develop in adolescence with a similar dismal prognosis like GBM and HAP in the elderly. We here describe spinal HAP with a distinct molecular profile for the first time."
"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular genetic disease caused by reduced survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMN is ubiquitous and deficient levels cause spinal cord motoneurons (MNs) degeneration and muscle atrophy. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which SMN reduction in muscle contributes to SMA disease is not fully understood. Therefore, studies evaluating atrophy mechanisms in SMA muscles will contribute to strengthening current knowledge of the pathology. Here we propose to evaluate autophagy in SMA muscle, a pathway altered in myotube atrophy. We analized autophagy proteins and mTOR in muscle biopsies, fibroblasts, and lymphoblast cell lines from SMA patients and in gastrocnemius muscles from a severe SMA mouse model. Human MNs differentiated from SMA and unaffected control iPSCs were also included in the analysis of the autophagy. Muscle biopsies, fibroblasts, and lymphoblast cell lines from SMA patients showed reduction of the autophagy marker LC3-II. In SMA mouse gastrocnemius, we observed lower levels of LC3-II, Beclin 1, and p62/SQSTM1 proteins at pre-symptomatic stage. mTOR phosphorylation at Ser2448 was decreased in SMA muscle cells. However, in mouse and human cultured SMA MNs mTOR phosphorylation and LC3-II levels were increased. These results suggest a differential regulation in SMA of the autophagy process in muscle cells and MNs. Opposite changes in autophagy proteins and mTOR phosphorylation between muscle cells and neurons were observed. These differences may reflect a specific&#xa0;response to SMN reduction, which could imply diverse tissue-dependent reactions to therapies that should be taken into account when treating SMA patients."
"The cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive neurodegeneration remain poorly defined. Recent clinical trial failures, difficult diagnosis, uncertain etiology, and lack of curative therapies prompted us to re-examine other hypotheses of neurodegenerative pathogenesis. Recent reports establish that mitochondrial and calcium dysregulation occur early in many neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and others. However, causal molecular evidence of mitochondrial and metabolic contributions to pathogenesis remains insufficient. Here we summarize the data supporting the hypothesis that mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction result from diverse etiologies of neuropathology. We provide a current and comprehensive review of the literature and interpret that defective mitochondrial metabolism is upstream and primary to protein aggregation and other dogmatic hypotheses of NDDs. Finally, we identify gaps in knowledge and propose therapeutic modulation of <sub>m</sub>Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange and mitochondrial function to alleviate metabolic impairments and treat NDDs."
"The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is a nidus for neurodegenerative pathologies and therefore an important region in which to study polypathology. We investigated associations between neurodegenerative pathologies and the thickness of different MTL subregions measured using high-resolution post-mortem MRI. Tau, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), amyloid-&#x3b2; and &#x3b1;-synuclein pathology were rated on a scale of 0 (absent)-3 (severe) in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (ERC) of 58 individuals with and without neurodegenerative diseases (median age 75.0&#xa0;years, 60.3% male). Thickness measurements in ERC, Brodmann Area (BA) 35 and 36, parahippocampal cortex, subiculum, cornu ammonis (CA)1 and the stratum radiatum lacunosum moleculare (SRLM) were derived from 0.2&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;0.2&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;0.2 mm<sup>3</sup> post-mortem MRI scans of excised MTL specimens from the contralateral hemisphere using a semi-automated approach. Spearman's rank correlations were performed between neurodegenerative pathologies and thickness, correcting for age, sex and hemisphere, including all four proteinopathies in the model. We found significant associations of (1) TDP-43 with thickness in all subregions (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.27 to r&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.46), and (2) tau with BA35 (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.31) and SRLM thickness (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.33). In amyloid-&#x3b2; and TDP-43 negative cases, we found strong significant associations of tau with ERC (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.40), BA35 (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.55), subiculum (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.42) and CA1 thickness (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.47). This unique dataset shows widespread MTL atrophy in relation to TDP-43 pathology and atrophy in&#xa0;regions affected early in Braak stageing and tau pathology. Moreover, the strong association of tau with thickness in early Braak regions in the absence of amyloid-&#x3b2; suggests a role of Primary Age-Related Tauopathy in neurodegeneration."
"Peripheral nerve injury is a serious health problem and repairing long nerve deficits remains a clinical challenge nowadays. Nerve guidance conduit (NGC) serves as the most promising alternative therapy strategy to autografts but its repairing efficiency needs improvement. In this study, we investigated whether modulating the immune microenvironment by Interleukin-17F (IL-17F) could promote NGC mediated peripheral nerve repair. Chitosan conduits were used to bridge sciatic nerve defect in IL-17F knockout mice and wild-type mice with autografts as controls. Our data revealed that IL-17F knockout mice had improved functional recovery and axonal regeneration of sciatic nerve bridged by chitosan conduits comparing to the wild-type mice. Notably, IL-17F knockout mice had enhanced anti-inflammatory macrophages in the NGC repairing microenvironment. In vitro data revealed that IL-17F knockout peritoneal and bone marrow derived macrophages had increased anti-inflammatory markers after treatment with the extracts from chitosan conduits, while higher pro-inflammatory markers were detected in the Raw264.7 macrophage cell line, wild-type peritoneal and bone marrow derived macrophages after the same treatment. The biased anti-inflammatory phenotype of macrophages by IL-17F knockout probably contributed to the improved chitosan conduit guided sciatic nerve regeneration. Additionally, IL-17F could enhance pro-inflammatory factors production in Raw264.7 cells and wild-type peritoneal macrophages. Altogether, IL-17F may partially mediate chitosan conduit induced pro-inflammatory polarization of macrophages during nerve repair. These results not only revealed a role of IL-17F in macrophage function, but also provided a unique and promising target, IL-17F, to modulate the microenvironment and enhance the peripheral nerve regeneration."
"Nuclear pore complex injury has recently emerged as an early and significant contributor to familial and sporadic ALS disease pathogenesis. However, the molecular events leading to this pathological phenomenon characterized by the reduction of specific nucleoporins from neuronal nuclear pore complexes remain largely unknown. This is due in part to a lack of knowledge regarding the biological pathways and proteins underlying nuclear pore complex homeostasis specifically in human neurons. We have recently uncovered that aberrant nuclear accumulation of the ESCRT-III protein CHMP7 initiates nuclear pore complex in familial and sporadic ALS neurons. In yeast and non-neuronal mammalian cells, nuclear relocalization of CHMP7 has been shown to recruit the ESCRT-III proteins CHMP4B, CHMP2B, and VPS4 to facilitate nuclear pore complex and nuclear envelope repair and homeostasis. Here, using super resolution structured illumination microscopy, we find that neither CHMP4B nor CHMP2B are increased in ALS neuronal nuclei. In contrast, VPS4 expression is significantly increased in ALS neuronal nuclei prior to the emergence of nuclear pore injury in a CHMP7 dependent manner. However, unlike our prior CHMP7 knockdown studies, impaired VPS4 function does not mitigate alterations to the NPC and the integral transmembrane nucleoporin POM121. Collectively our data suggest that while alterations in VPS4 subcellular localization appear to be coincident with nuclear pore complex injury, therapeutic efforts to mitigate this pathogenic cascade should be targeted towards upstream events such as the nuclear accumulation of CHMP7 as we have previously described."
"Although the right temporal variant frontotemporal dementia (rtvFTD) is characterised by distinct clinical and radiological features, its underlying histopathology remains elusive. Being considered a right-sided variant of semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), TDP-43 type C pathology has been linked to the syndrome, but this has not been studied in detail in large cohorts. In this case report and systematic review, we report the autopsy results of five subjects diagnosed with rtvFTD from our cohort and 44 single rtvFTD subjects from the literature. Macroscopic pathological evaluation of the combined results revealed that rtvFTD demonstrated either a frontotemporal or temporal evolution, even if the degeneration started in the right temporal lobe initially. FTLD-TDP type C was the most common underlying pathology in rtvFTD, however, in 64% of rtvFTD, other underlying pathologies than FTLD-TDP type C were present, such as Tau-MAPT and FTLD-TDP type A and B. Additionally, accompanying motor neuron or corticospinal tract degeneration was observed in 28% of rtvFTD patients. Our results show that in contrast to the general assumption, rtvFTD might not be a pure FTLD-TDP type C disorder, unlike its left temporal counterpart svPPA. Large sample size pathological studies are warranted to understand the diverse pathologies of the right and left temporal variants of frontotemporal dementia."
"We identified an autosomal dominant progranulin mutation carrier without symptoms of dementia in her lifetime (Reduced Penetrance Mutation Carrier, RedPenMC). This resistance to develop expected pathology presents a unique opportunity to interrogate neurodegenerative mechanisms. We performed multimodal single-nuclei analyses of post-mortem frontal cortex from RedPenMC, including transcriptomics and global levels of chromatin marks. RedPenMC had an increased ratio of GRN-expressing microglia, higher levels of activating histone mark H3k4me3 in microglia and lower levels of the repressive chromatin marks H3k9me1 and H3k9me3 in the frontal cortex than her affected mutation carrier son and evidence of higher protein levels of progranulin in both plasma and brain homogenates. Although the study is limited to one case, the results support that restoring brain progranulin levels may be sufficient to escape neurodegeneration and FTD. In addition to previously identified modifier genes, it is possible that epigenetic marks may contribute to the increased progranulin expression in cases of reduced penetrance. These findings may stimulate similar follow-up studies and new therapeutic approaches."
"The microglial reaction is a hallmark of neurodegenerative conditions, and elements thereof may exert differential effects on disease progression, either worsening or ameliorating severity. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a syndrome characterized by cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43 protein and atrophy of motor neurons in the cortex and spinal cord, the transcriptomic signatures of microglia during disease progression are incompletely understood. Here, we performed longitudinal RNAseq analysis of cortical and spinal cord microglia from rNLS8 mice, in which doxycycline-regulatable expression of human TDP-43 (hTDP-43) in the cytoplasm of neurons recapitulates many features of ALS. Transgene suppression in rNLS8 mice leads to functional, anatomical and electrophysiological resolution that is dependent on a microglial reaction that is concurrent with recovery rather than disease onset. We identified basal differences between the gene expression profiles of microglia dependent on localization in spinal cord or cortex. Microglia subjected to chronic hTDP-43 overexpression demonstrated transcriptomic changes in both locations. We noted strong upregulation of Apoe, Axl, Cd63, Clec7a, Csf1, Cst7, Igf1, Itgax, Lgals3, Lilrb4, Lpl and Spp1 during late disease and recovery. Importantly, we identified a distinct suite of differentially expressed genes associated with each phase of disease progression and recovery. Differentially expressed genes were associated with chemotaxis, phagocytosis, inflammation, and production of neuroprotective factors. These data provide new insights into the microglial reaction in TDP-43 proteinopathy. Genes differentially expressed during progression and recovery may provide insight into a unique instance in which the microglial reaction promotes functional recovery after neuronal insult."
"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays important roles in brain tumor pathogenesis and treatment response, yet our understanding of its function and heterogeneity within or across brain tumor types remains poorly characterized. Here we analyze the neurovascular unit (NVU) of pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG) and diffuse midline glioma (DMG) using patient derived xenografts and natively forming glioma mouse models. We show tumor-associated vascular differences between these glioma subtypes, and parallels between PDX and mouse model systems, with DMG models maintaining a more normal vascular architecture, BBB function and endothelial transcriptional program relative to pHGG models. Unlike prior work in angiogenic brain tumors, we find that expression of secreted Wnt antagonists do not alter the tumor-associated vascular phenotype in DMG tumor models. Together, these findings highlight vascular heterogeneity between pHGG and DMG and differences in their response to alterations in developmental BBB signals that may participate in driving these pathological differences."
"Increasing evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles (EVs) play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously reported that the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) interface, formed by the choroid plexus epithelial (CPE) cells, releases an increased amount of EVs into the CSF in response to peripheral inflammation. Here, we studied the importance of CP-mediated EV release in AD pathogenesis. We observed increased EV levels in the CSF of young transgenic APP/PS1 mice which correlated with high amyloid beta (A&#x3b2;) CSF levels at this age. The intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of A&#x3b2; oligomers (A&#x3b2;O) in wild-type mice revealed a significant increase of EVs in the CSF, signifying that the presence of CSF-A&#x3b2;O is sufficient to induce increased EV secretion. Using in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo approaches, we identified the CP as a major source of the CSF-EVs. Interestingly, A&#x3b2;O-induced, CP-derived EVs induced pro-inflammatory effects in mixed cortical cultures. Proteome analysis of these EVs revealed the presence of several pro-inflammatory proteins, including the complement protein C3. Strikingly, inhibition of EV production using GW4869 resulted in protection against acute A&#x3b2;O-induced cognitive decline. Further research into the underlying mechanisms of this EV secretion might open up novel therapeutic strategies to impact the pathogenesis and progression of AD."
"In this review, we discuss the synaptic aspects of Tau pathology occurring during Alzheimer's disease (AD) and how this may relate to memory impairment, a major hallmark of AD. Whilst the clinical diagnosis of AD patients is a loss of working memory and long-term declarative memory, the histological diagnosis is the presence of neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated Tau and Amyloid-beta plaques. Tau pathology spreads through synaptically connected neurons to impair synaptic function preceding the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic loss, axonal retraction and cell death. Alongside synaptic pathology, recent data suggest that Tau has physiological roles in the pre- or post- synaptic compartments. Thus, we have seen a shift in the research focus from Tau as a microtubule-stabilising protein in axons, to Tau as a synaptic protein with roles in accelerating spine formation, dendritic elongation, and in synaptic plasticity coordinating memory pathways. We collate here the myriad of emerging interactions and physiological roles of synaptic Tau, and discuss the current evidence that synaptic Tau contributes to pathology in AD."
"Treatment with human pituitary-derived growth hormone (hGH) was responsible for a significant proportion of iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (iCJD) cases. France and the UK experienced the largest case numbers of hGH-iCJD, with 122 and 81 cases respectively. Differences in the frequency of the three PRNP codon 129 polymorphisms (MM, MV and VV) and the estimated incubation periods associated with each of these genotypes in the French and the UK hGH-iCJD cohorts led to the suggestion that the prion strains responsible for these two hGH-iCJD cohorts were different. In this study, we characterized the prion strains responsible for hGH-iCJD cases originating from UK (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11) and France (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11) using human PrP expressing mouse models. The cases included PRNP MM, MV and VV genotypes from both countries. UK and French sporadic CJD (sCJD) cases were included as controls. The prion strains identified following inoculation with hGH-iCJD homogenates corresponded to the two most frequently observed sCJD prion strains (M1<sup>CJD</sup> and V2<sup>CJD</sup>). However, in clear contradiction to the initial hypothesis, the prion strains that were identified in the UK and the French hGH-iCJD&#xa0;cases were not radically different. In the vast majority of the cases originating from both countries, the V2<sup>CJD</sup> strain or a mixture of M1<sup>CJD</sup>&#x2009;+&#x2009;V2<sup>CJD</sup> strains were identified. These data strongly support the contention that the differences in the epidemiological and genetic profiles observed in the UK and France hGH-iCJD cohorts cannot be attributed only to the transmission of different prion strains."
"Diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumours (DLGNT) represent rare enigmatic CNS tumours of childhood. Most patients with this disease share common radiological and histopathological features but the clinical course of this disease is variable. A radiological hallmark of this disease is widespread leptomeningeal enhancement that may involve the entire neuroaxis with predilection for the posterior fossa and spine. The classic pathologic features include low- to moderate-density cellular lesions with OLIG2 expression and evidence of 'oligodendroglioma-like' appearance. The MAPK/ERK signaling pathway has recently been reported as a potential driver of tumourigenesis in up to 80% of DLGNT with KIAA1549:BRAF fusions being the most common event seen. Until now, limited analysis of the biological drivers of tumourigenesis has been undertaken via targeted profiling, chromosomal analysis and immunohistochemistry. Our study represents the first examples of comprehensive genomic sequencing in DLGNT and shows that it is not only feasible but crucial to our understanding of this rare disease. Moreover, we demonstrate that DLGNT may be more genomically complex than single-event MAPK/ERK signaling pathway tumours."
"It is recognized that the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in the biology of cancer. To better understand the role of immune cell components in CNS tumors, we applied a deconvolution approach to bulk DNA methylation array data in a large set of newly profiled samples (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;741) as well as samples from external data sources (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3311) of methylation-defined glial and glioneuronal tumors. Using the cell-type proportion data as input, we used dimensionality reduction to visualize sample-wise patterns that emerge from the cell type proportion estimations. In IDH-wildtype glioblastomas (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2,072), we identified distinct tumor clusters based on immune cell proportion and demonstrated an association with oncogenic alterations such as EGFR amplification and CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion. We also investigated the immune cluster-specific distribution of four malignant cellular states (AC-like, OPC-like, MES-like and NPC-like) in the IDH-wildtype cohort. We identified two major immune-based subgroups of IDH-mutant gliomas, which largely aligned with 1p/19q co-deletion status. Non-codeleted gliomas showed distinct proportions of a key genomic aberration (CDKN2A/B loss) among immune cell-based groups. We also observed significant positive correlations between monocyte proportion and expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 (R&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.54 and 0.68, respectively). Overall, the findings highlight specific roles of the TME in biology and classification of CNS tumors, where specific immune cell admixtures correlate with tumor types and genomic alterations."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of amyloid &#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) and neurofibrillary tangles. The last decade, it became increasingly clear that neuroinflammation plays a key role in both the initiation and progression of AD. Moreover, also the presence of peripheral inflammation has been extensively documented. However, it is still ambiguous whether this observed inflammation is cause or consequence of AD pathogenesis. Recently, this has been studied using amyloid precursor protein (APP) overexpression mouse models of AD. However, the findings might be confounded by APP-overexpression artifacts. Here, we investigated the effect of low-grade peripheral inflammation in the&#xa0;APP knock-in (App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>) mouse model. This revealed that low-grade peripheral inflammation affects (1) microglia characteristics, (2) blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier integrity, (3) peripheral immune cell infiltration and (4) A&#x3b2; deposition in the brain. Next, we identified mechanisms that might cause this effect on AD pathology, more precisely A&#x3b2; efflux, persistent microglial activation and insufficient A&#x3b2; clearance, neuronal dysfunction and promotion of A&#x3b2; aggregation. Our results further strengthen the believe that even low-grade peripheral inflammation has detrimental effects on AD progression and may further reinforce the idea to modulate peripheral inflammation as a therapeutic strategy for AD."
"The ryanodine receptor RyR1 is the main sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel in skeletal muscle and acts as a connecting link between electrical stimulation and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent muscle contraction. Abnormal RyR1 activity compromises normal muscle function and results in various human disorders including malignant hyperthermia, central core disease, and centronuclear myopathy. However, RYR1 is one of the largest genes of the human genome and accumulates numerous missense variants of uncertain significance (VUS), precluding an efficient molecular diagnosis for many patients and families. Here we describe a recurrent RYR1 mutation previously classified as VUS, and we provide clinical, histological, and genetic data supporting its pathogenicity. The heterozygous c.12083C&gt;T (p.Ser4028Leu) mutation was found in thirteen patients from nine unrelated congenital myopathy families with consistent clinical presentation, and either segregated with the disease in the dominant families or occurred de novo. The affected individuals essentially manifested neonatal or infancy-onset hypotonia, delayed motor milestones, and a benign disease course differing from classical RYR1-related muscle disorders. Muscle biopsies showed unspecific histological and ultrastructural findings, while RYR1-typical cores and internal nuclei were seen only in single patients. In conclusion, our data evidence the causality of the RYR1 c.12083C&gt;T (p.Ser4028Leu) mutation in the development of an atypical congenital myopathy with gradually improving motor function over the first decades of life, and may direct molecular diagnosis for patients with comparable clinical presentation and unspecific histopathological features on the muscle biopsy."
"Recent studies suggest that brain cell type specific intracellular environments may play important roles in the generation of structurally different protein aggregates that define neurodegenerative diseases. Using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) and biochemical and vibrational spectroscopy techniques, we studied whether Parkinson's disease (PD) patient genomes could modulate alpha-synuclein (aSYN) protein aggregates formation. We found increased &#x3b2;-sheets and aggregated aSYN in PD patient hiPSC-derived midbrain cells, compared to controls. Importantly, we discovered that aSYN protein aggregation is modulated by patient brain cells' intracellular milieus at the primary nucleation phase. Additionally, we found changes in the formation of aSYN fibrils when employing cellular extracts from familial PD compared to idiopathic PD, in a Thioflavin T-based fluorescence assay. The data suggest that changes in cellular milieu induced by patient genomes trigger structural changes of aSYN potentially leading to the formation of strains having different structures, properties and seeding propensities."
"Mutations in the presenilin (PS/PSEN) genes encoding the catalytic components of &#x3b3;-secretase accelerate amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) and tau pathologies in familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the mechanisms by which these mutations affect A&#x3b2; are well defined, the precise role PS/&#x3b3;-secretase on tau pathology in neurodegeneration independently of A&#x3b2; is largely unclear. Here we report that neuronal PS deficiency in conditional knockout (cKO) mice results in age-dependent brain atrophy, inflammatory responses and accumulation of pathological tau in neurons and glial cells. Interestingly, genetic inactivation of presenilin 1 (PS1) or both PS genes in mutant human Tau transgenic mice exacerbates memory deficits by accelerating phosphorylation and aggregation of tau in excitatory neurons of vulnerable AD brain regions (e.g., hippocampus, cortex and amygdala). Remarkably, neurofilament (NF) light chain (NF-L) and phosphorylated NF are abnormally accumulated in the brain of Tau mice lacking PS. Synchrotron infrared microspectroscopy revealed aggregated and oligomeric &#x3b2;-sheet structures in amyloid plaque-free PS-deficient Tau mice. Hippocampal-dependent memory deficits are associated with synaptic tau accumulation and reduction of pre- and post-synaptic proteins in Tau mice. Thus, partial loss of PS/&#x3b3;-secretase in neurons results in temporal- and spatial-dependent tau aggregation associated with memory deficits and neurodegeneration. Our findings show that tau phosphorylation and aggregation are key pathological processes that may underlie neurodegeneration caused by familial AD-linked PSEN&#xa0;mutations."
"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a cervid prion disease caused by the accumulation of an infectious misfolded conformer (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) of cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>). It has been spreading rapidly in North America and also found in Asia and Europe. Although bovine spongiform encephalopathy (i.e. mad cow disease) is the only animal prion disease known to be zoonotic, the transmissibility of CWD to humans remains uncertain. Here we report the generation of the first CWD-derived infectious human PrP<sup>Sc</sup> by elk CWD PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-seeded conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> in normal human brain homogenates using in vitro protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA). Western blotting with human PrP selective antibody confirmed that the PMCA-generated protease-resistant PrP<sup>Sc</sup> was derived from the human PrP<sup>C</sup> substrate. Two lines of humanized transgenic mice expressing human PrP with either Val or Met at the polymorphic codon 129 developed clinical prion disease following intracerebral inoculation with the PMCA-generated CWD-derived human PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Diseased mice exhibited distinct PrP<sup>Sc</sup> patterns and neuropathological changes in the brain. Our study,&#xa0;using PMCA and animal bioassays, provides the first evidence that CWD PrP<sup>Sc</sup> can cross the species barrier to convert human PrP<sup>C</sup> into infectious PrP<sup>Sc</sup> that can produce bona fide prion disease when inoculated into humanized transgenic mice."
"Progressive accumulation of Amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) deposits in the brain is a characteristic neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). During disease progression, extracellular A&#x3b2; plaques undergo specific changes in their composition by the sequential deposition of different modified A&#x3b2; species. Microglia are implicated in the restriction of amyloid deposits and play a major role in internalization and degradation of A&#x3b2;. Recent studies showed that rare variants of the Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) are associated with an increased risk for AD. Post-translational modifications of A&#x3b2; could modulate the interaction with TREM2, and the uptake by microglia. Here, we demonstrate that genetic deletion of TREM2 or expression of a disease associated TREM2 variant in mice lead to differential accumulation of modified and non-modified A&#x3b2; species in extracellular plaques and intraneuronal deposits. Human brains with rare TREM2 AD risk variants also showed altered deposition of modified A&#x3b2; species in the different brain lesions as compared to cases with the common variant of TREM2. These findings indicate that TREM2 plays a critical role in the development and the composition of A&#x3b2; deposits, not only in extracellular plaques, but also intraneuronally, that both could contribute to the pathogenesis of AD."
"Infratentorial oligodendrogliomas, a rare pathological entity, are generally considered metastatic lesions from supratentorial primary tumors. Here, we report the case of a 23-year-old man presenting with a histopathologically confirmed right precentral gyrus grade 2 oligodendroglioma and a concurrent pontine grade 3 oligodendroglioma. The pontine lesion was biopsied approximately a year after the biopsy of the precentral lesion due to disease progression despite 4 cycles of procarbazine-CCNU-vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy and stable supratentorial disease. Histology and genetic analysis of the pontine biopsy were consistent with grade 3 oligodendroglioma, and comparison of the two lesions demonstrated common 1p/19q co-deletions and TERT promoter mutations but distinct IDH1 mutations, with a non-canonical IDH1 R132G mutation identified in the infratentorial lesion and a R132H mutation identified in the cortical lesion. Initiation of Temozolomide led to complete response of the supratentorial lesion and durable disease control, while Temozolomide with subsequent radiation therapy of 54&#xa0;Gy in 30 fractions resulted in partial response of the pontine lesion. This case report supports possible distinct molecular pathogenesis in supratentorial and infratentorial oligodendrogliomas and raises questions about the role of different IDH1 mutant isoforms in explaining treatment resistance to different chemotherapy regimens. Importantly, this case suggests that biopsies of all radiographic lesions, when feasible and safe, should be considered in order to adequately guide management in multicentric oligodendrogliomas."
"Cerebral vascular injury as a consequence of blast-induced traumatic brain injury is primarily the result of blast wave-induced mechanical disruptions within the neurovascular unit. In rodent models of blast-induced traumatic brain injury, chronic vascular degenerative processes are associated with the development of an age-dependent post-traumatic stress disorder-like phenotype. To investigate the evolution of blast-induced chronic vascular degenerative changes, Long-Evans rats were blast-exposed (3&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;74.5&#xa0;kPa) and their brains analyzed at different times post-exposure by X-ray microcomputed tomography, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. On microcomputed tomography scans, regional cerebral vascular attenuation or occlusion was observed as early as 48&#xa0;h post-blast, and cerebral vascular disorganization was visible at 6&#xa0;weeks and more accentuated at 13&#xa0;months post-blast. Progression of the late-onset pathology was characterized by detachment of the endothelial and smooth muscle cellular elements from the neuropil due to degeneration and loss of arteriolar perivascular astrocytes. Development of this pathology was associated with vascular remodeling and neuroinflammation as increased levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), collagen type IV loss, and microglial activation were observed in the affected vasculature. Blast-induced chronic alterations within the neurovascular unit should affect cerebral blood circulation, glymphatic flow and intramural periarterial drainage, all of which may contribute to development of the blast-induced behavioral phenotype. Our results also identify astrocytic degeneration as a potential target for the development of therapies to treat blast-induced brain injury."
"Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) are high-grade tumors of the brainstem that often occur in children, with a median overall survival of less than one year. Given the fact that DIPGs are resistant to chemotherapy and are not amenable to surgical resection, it is imperative to develop new therapeutic strategies for this deadly disease. The p53 pathway is dysregulated by TP53 (~&#x2009;60%) or PPM1D gain-of-function mutations (~&#x2009;30%) in DIPG cases. PPM1D gain-of-function mutations suppress p53 activity and result in DIPG tumorigenesis. While MDM2 is a major negative regulator of p53, the efficacy of MDM2 inhibitor has not been tested in DIPG preclinical models. In this study, we performed a comprehensive validation of MDM2 inhibitor RG7388 in patient-derived DIPG cell lines established from both TP53 wild-type/PPM1D-mutant and TP53 mutant/PPM1D wild-type tumors, as well in TP53 knockout isogenic DIPG cell line models. RG7388 selectively inhibited the proliferation of the TP53 wild-type/PPM1D mutant DIPG cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The anti-proliferative effects were p53-dependent. RNA-Seq data showed that differential gene expression induced by RG7388 treatment was enriched in the p53 pathways. RG7388 reactivated the p53 pathway and induced apoptosis as well as G1 arrest. In vivo, RG7388 was able to reach the brainstem and exerted therapeutic efficacy in an orthotopic DIPG xenograft model. Hence, this study demonstrates the pre-clinical efficacy potential of RG7388 in the TP53 wild-type/PPM1D mutant DIPG subgroup and may provide critical insight on the design of future clinical trials applying this drug in DIPG patients."
"Although pathology of tauopathies is characterized by abnormal tau protein aggregation in both gray and white matter regions of the brain, neuropathological investigations have generally focused on abnormalities in the cerebral cortex because the canonical aggregates that form the diagnostic criteria for these disorders predominate there. This corticocentric focus tends to deemphasize the relevance of the more complex white matter pathologies, which remain less well characterized and understood. We took a data-driven machine-learning approach to identify novel disease-specific morphologic signatures of white matter aggregates in three tauopathies: Alzheimer disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). We developed automated approaches using whole slide images of tau immunostained sections from 49 human autopsy brains (16 AD,13 CBD, 20 PSP) to identify cortex/white matter regions and individual tau aggregates, and compared tau-aggregate morphology across these diseases. Tau burden in the gray and white matter for individual subjects strongly correlated in a highly disease-specific fashion. We discovered previously unrecognized tau morphologies for AD, CBD and PSP that may be of importance in disease classification. Intriguingly, our models classified diseases equally well based on either white or gray matter tau staining. Our results suggest that tau pathology in white matter is informative, disease-specific, and linked to gray matter pathology. Machine learning has the potential to reveal latent information in histologic images that may represent previously unrecognized patterns of neuropathology, and additional studies of tau pathology in white matter could improve diagnostic accuracy."
"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 34 (SCA34) is an autosomal dominant inherited ataxia due to mutations in ELOVL4, which encodes one of the very long-chain fatty acid elongases. SCA38, another spinocerebellar ataxia, is caused by mutations in ELOVL5, a gene encoding another elongase. However, there have been no previous studies describing the neuropathology of either SCA34 or 38. This report describes the neuropathological findings of an 83-year-old man with SCA34 carrying a pathological ELOVL4 mutation (NM_022726, c.736T&gt;G, p.W246G). Macroscopic findings include atrophies in the pontine base, cerebellum, and cerebral cortices. Microscopically, marked neuronal and pontocerebellar fiber loss was observed in the pontine base. In addition, in the pontine base, accumulation of CD68-positive macrophages laden with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive material was observed. Many vacuolar lesions were found in the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres and, to a lesser extent, in the brainstem and spinal cord white matter. Immunohistological examination and ultrastructural observations with an electron microscope suggest that these vacuolar lesions are remnants of degenerated oligodendrocytes. Electron microscopy also revealed myelin sheath destruction. Unexpectedly, aggregation of the four-repeat tau was observed in a spatial pattern reminiscent of progressive supranuclear palsy. The tau lesions included glial fibrillary tangles resembling tuft-shaped astrocytes and neurofibrillary tangles and pretangles. This is the first report to illustrate that a heterozygous missense mutation in ELOVL4 leads to neuronal loss accompanied by macrophages laden with PAS-positive material in the pontine base and oligodendroglial degeneration leading to widespread vacuoles in the white matter in SCA34."
"Sensory neurons have recently emerged as components of the tumor microenvironment. Nevertheless, whether sensory neuronal activity is important for tumor progression remains unknown. Here we used Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by a Designer Drug (DREADD) technology to inhibit or activate sensory neurons' firing within the melanoma tumor. Melanoma growth and angiogenesis were accelerated following inhibition of sensory neurons' activity and were reduced following overstimulation of these neurons. Sensory neuron-specific overactivation also induced a boost in the immune surveillance by increasing tumor-infiltrating anti-tumor lymphocytes, while reducing immune-suppressor cells. In humans, a retrospective in silico analysis of melanoma biopsies revealed that increased expression of sensory neurons-related genes within melanoma was associated with improved survival. These findings suggest that sensory innervations regulate melanoma progression, indicating that manipulation of sensory neurons' activity may provide a valuable tool to improve melanoma patients' outcomes."
"Tau neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is closely linked to neurodegeneration, and is the early pathological change associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). To elucidate patterns of structural change in the MTL specifically associated with tau pathology, we compared high-resolution ex vivo MRI scans of human postmortem MTL specimens with histology-based pathological assessments of the MTL. MTL specimens were obtained from twenty-nine brain donors, including patients with AD, other dementias, and individuals with no known history of neurological disease. Ex vivo MRI scans were combined using a customized groupwise diffeomorphic registration approach to construct a 3D probabilistic atlas that captures the anatomical variability of the MTL. Using serial histology imaging in eleven specimens, we labelled the MTL subregions in the atlas based on cytoarchitecture. Leveraging the atlas and neuropathological ratings of tau and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology severity, morphometric analysis was performed to correlate regional MTL thickness with the severity of tau pathology, after correcting for age and TDP-43 pathology. We found significant correlations between tau pathology and thickness in the entorhinal cortex (ERC) and stratum radiatum lacunosum moleculare (SRLM). When focusing on cases with low levels of TDP-43 pathology, we found strong associations between tau pathology and thickness in the ERC, SRLM and the subiculum/cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) subfields of the hippocampus, consistent with early Braak stages."
"Pathogenic variants in SETX cause two distinct neurological diseases, a loss-of-function recessive disorder, ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2), and a dominant gain-of-function motor neuron disorder, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type 4 (ALS4). We identified two unrelated patients with the same de novo c.23C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;T (p.Thr8Met) variant in SETX presenting with an early-onset, severe polyneuropathy. As rare private gene variation is often difficult to link to genetic neurological disease by DNA sequence alone, we used transcriptional network analysis to functionally validate these patients with severe de novo SETX-related neurodegenerative disorder. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify disease-associated modules from two different ALS4 mouse models and compared to confirmed ALS4 patient data to derive an ALS4-specific transcriptional signature. WGCNA of whole blood RNA-sequencing data from a patient with the p.Thr8Met SETX variant was compared to ALS4 and control patients to determine if this signature could be used to identify affected patients. WGCNA identified overlapping disease-associated modules in ALS4 mouse model data and ALS4 patient data. Mouse ALS4 disease-associated modules were not associated with AOA2 disease modules, confirming distinct disease-specific signatures. The expression profile of a patient carrying the c.23C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;T (p.Thr8Met) variant was significantly associated with the human and mouse ALS4 signature, confirming the relationship between this SETX variant and disease. The similar clinical presentations of the two unrelated patients with the same de novo p.Thr8Met variant and the functional data provide strong evidence that the p.Thr8Met variant is pathogenic. The distinct phenotype expands the clinical spectrum of SETX-related disorders."
"A novel histomolecular tumor of the central nervous system, the ""intracranial mesenchymal tumor (IMT), FET-CREB fusion-positive"" has recently been identified in the literature and will be added to the 2021 World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System. However, our latest study using DNA-methylation analyses has revealed that intracranial FET-CREB fused tumors do not represent a single molecular tumor entity. Among them, the main subgroup presented classical features of angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma, having ultrastructural features of arachnoidal cells, for. Another tumor type with clear cell component and histopathological signs of aggressivity clustered in close vicinity with clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue. Herein, we report one case of IMT with a novel SMARCA2-CREM fusion which has until now never been described in soft tissue or the central nervous system. We compare its clinical, histopathological, immunophenotypic, genetic and epigenetic features with those previously described in IMT, FET-CREB fusion-positive. Interestingly, the current case did not cluster with IMT, FET-CREB fusion-positive but rather presented histopathological (clear cell morphology with signs of malignancy), clinical (with a dismal course with several recurrences, metastases and finally the patient's death), genetic (fusion implicating the CREM gene), and epigenetic (DNA-methylation profiling) similarities with our previously reported clear cell sarcoma-like tumor of the central nervous system. Our results added data suggesting that different clinical and histomolecular tumor subtypes or grades seem to be included within the terminology ""IMT, FET-CREB fusion-positive"", and that further series of cases are needed to better characterize them."
"Serine 129 (S129) phosphorylation of &#x3b1;-synuclein (&#x3b1;Syn) is a central feature of Lewy body (LB) disease pathology. Although the neighboring tyrosine residues Y125, Y133, and Y136 are also phosphorylation sites, little is known regarding potential roles of phosphorylation cross-talk between these sites and its involvement in the pathogenesis of LB disease. Here, we found that &#x3b1;Syn aggregates are predominantly phosphorylated at Y136 in the Lewy body dementia brain, which is mediated by unexpected kinase activity of Casein kinase 2 (CK2). Aggregate formation with S129 and Y136 phosphorylation of recombinant &#x3b1;Syn (r-&#x3b1;Syn) were induced by CK2 but abolished by replacement of S129 with alanine (S129A) in vitro. Mutation of Y136 to alanine (Y136A) promoted aggregate formation and S129 phosphorylation of r-&#x3b1;Syn by CK2 in vitro. Introduction of Y136A r-&#x3b1;Syn oligomers into cultured cells exhibited increased levels of aggregates with S129 phosphorylation compared to wild-type r-&#x3b1;Syn oligomers. In addition, aggregate formation with S129 phosphorylation induced by introduction of wild-type r-&#x3b1;Syn oligomers was significantly attenuated by CK2 inhibition, which resulted in an unexpected increase in Y136 phosphorylation in cultured cells. Our findings suggest the involvement of CK2-related &#x3b1;Syn Y136 phosphorylation in the pathogenesis of LB disease and its potential as a therapeutic target."
"Pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) are common, generally benign tumors with complex clinical characteristics related to hormone hypersecretion and/or growing sellar tumor mass. PitNETs can be classified based on the expression pattern of anterior pituitary hormones and three main transcriptions factors (TF), SF1, PIT1 and TPIT that regulate differentiation of adenohypophysial cells. Here, we have extended this classification based on the global transcriptomics landscape using tumor tissue from a well-defined cohort comprising 51 PitNETs of different clinical and histological types. The molecular profiles were compared with current classification schemes based on immunohistochemistry. Our results identified three main clusters of PitNETs that were aligned with the main pituitary TFs expression patterns. Our analyses enabled further identification of specific genes and expression patterns, including both known and unknown genes, that could distinguish the three different classes of PitNETs. We conclude that the current classification of PitNETs based on the expression of SF1, PIT1 and TPIT reflects three distinct subtypes of PitNETs with different underlying biology and partly independent from the expression of corresponding hormones. The transcriptomic analysis reveals several potentially targetable tumor-driving genes with previously unknown role in pituitary tumorigenesis."
"The Bridging Integrator 1 (BIN1) gene is a major susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Deciphering its pathophysiological role is challenging due to its numerous isoforms. Here we observed in Drosophila that human BIN1 isoform1 (BIN1iso1) overexpression, contrary to human BIN1 isoform8 (BIN1iso8) and human BIN1 isoform9 (BIN1iso9), induced an accumulation of endosomal vesicles and neurodegeneration. Systematic search for endosome regulators able to prevent BIN1iso1-induced neurodegeneration indicated that a defect at the early endosome level is responsible for the neurodegeneration. In human induced neurons (hiNs) and cerebral organoids, BIN1 knock-out resulted in the narrowing of early endosomes. This phenotype was rescued by BIN1iso1 but not BIN1iso9 expression. Finally, BIN1iso1 overexpression also led to an increase in the size of early endosomes and neurodegeneration in hiNs. Altogether, our data demonstrate that the AD susceptibility gene BIN1, and especially BIN1iso1, contributes to early-endosome size deregulation, which is an early pathophysiological hallmark of AD pathology."
"In sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), the pathological changes appear to be restricted to the central nervous system. Only involvement of the trigeminal ganglion is widely accepted. The present study systematically examined the involvement of peripheral ganglia in sCJD utilizing the currently most sensitive technique for detecting prions in tissue morphologically. The trigeminal, nodose, stellate, and celiac ganglia, as well as ganglia of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar sympathetic trunk of 40 patients were analyzed with the paraffin-embedded tissue (PET)-blot method. Apart from the trigeminal ganglion, which contained protein aggregates in five of 19 prion type 1 patients, evidence of prion protein aggregation was only found in patients associated with type 2 prions. With&#xa0;the PET-blot, aggregates of prion protein type 2 were found in all trigeminal (17/17), in some nodose (5 of 7) and thoracic (3 of 6) ganglia, as well as in a few celiac (4 of 19) and lumbar (1 of 5) ganglia of sCJD patients. Whereas aggregates of both prion types may spread to dorsal root ganglia, more CNS-distant ganglia seem to be only involved in patients accumulating prion type 2. Whether the prion type association is due to selection by prion type-dependent replication, or due to a prion type-dependent property of axonal spread remains to be resolved in further studies."
"The type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is an intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) release channel on the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum that is required for skeletal muscle contraction. RyR1 channel activity is modulated by ligands, including the activators Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ATP. Patients with inherited mutations in RyR1 may exhibit muscle weakness as part of a heterogeneous, complex disorder known as RYR1-related myopathy (RYR1-RM) or more recently termed RYR1-related disorders (RYR1-RD). Guided by high-resolution structures of skeletal muscle RyR1, obtained using cryogenic electron microscopy, we introduced mutations into putative Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ATP binding sites and studied the function of the resulting mutant channels. These mutations confirmed the functional significance of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ATP binding sites identified by structural studies based on the effects on channel regulation. Under normal conditions, Ca<sup>2+</sup> activates RyR1 at low concentrations (&#xb5;M) and inhibits it at high concentrations (mM). Mutations in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site impaired both activating and inhibitory regulation of the channel, suggesting a single site for both high and low affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent regulation of RyR1 function. Mutation of residues that interact with the adenine ring of ATP abrogated ATP binding to the channel, whereas mutating residues that interact with the triphosphate tail only affected the degree of activation. In addition, patients with mutations at the Ca<sup>2+</sup> or ATP binding sites suffer from muscle weakness, therefore impaired RyR1 channel regulation by either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or ATP may contribute to the pathophysiology of RYR1-RM in some patients."
"LIN28A overexpression has been identified in malignant brain tumors called embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes&#xa0;(ETMR) but its specific role during brain development remains largely unknown. Radial glia cells of the ventricular zone (VZ) are proposed as a cell of origin for ETMR. We asked whether an overexpression of LIN28A in such cells might affect brain development or result in the formation of brain tumors.Constitutive overexpression of LIN28A in hGFAP-cre::lsl-Lin28A (GL) mice led to a transient increase of proliferation in the cortical VZ at embryonic stages but no postnatal brain tumor formation. Postnatally, GL mice displayed a pyramidal cell layer dispersion of the hippocampus and altered spine and dendrite morphology, including reduced dendritic spine densities in the hippocampus and cortex. GL mice displayed hyperkinetic activity and differential quantitative MS-based proteomics revealed altered time dependent molecular functions regarding mRNA processing and spine morphogenesis. Phosphoproteomic analyses indicated a downregulation of mTOR pathway modulated proteins such as Map1b being involved in microtubule dynamics.In conclusion, we show that Lin28A overexpression transiently increases proliferation of neural precursor cells but it is not sufficient to drive brain tumors in vivo. In contrast, Lin28A impacts on protein abundancy patterns related to spine morphogenesis and phosphorylation levels of proteins involved in microtubule dynamics, resulting in decreased spine densities of neurons in the hippocampus and cortex as well as in altered behavior. Our work provides new insights into the role of LIN28A for neuronal morphogenesis and development and may reveal future targets for treatment of ETMR patients."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with inner retina (nerve fiber and ganglion cell layers) thinning. In contrast, we have seen outer retina thinning driven by photoreceptor outer nuclear layer (ONL) thinning with antemortem optical coherence tomography (OCT) among patients considered to have a frontotemporal degeneration tauopathy (FTLD-Tau). Our objective was to determine if postmortem retinal tissue from FTLD-Tau patients demonstrates ONL loss observed antemortem on OCT. Two probable FTLD-Tau patients that were deeply phenotyped by clinical and genetic testing were imaged with OCT and followed to autopsy. Postmortem brain and retinal tissue were evaluated by a neuropathologist and ocular pathologist, respectively, masked to diagnosis. OCT findings were correlated with retinal histology. The two patients had autopsy-confirmed FTLD-Tau neuropathology and had antemortem OCT measurements showing ONL thinning (66.9&#xa0;&#x3bc;m, patient #1; 74.9&#xa0;&#x3bc;m, patient #2) below the 95% confidence interval of normal limits (75.1-120.7&#xa0;&#x3bc;m) in our healthy control cohort. Postmortem, retinal tissue from both patients demonstrated loss of nuclei in the ONL, matching ONL loss visualized on antemortem OCT. Nuclei counts from each area of ONL loss (2 - 3 nuclei per column) seen in patient eyes were below the 95% confidence interval (4 - 8 nuclei per column for ONL) of 3 normal control retinas analyzed at the same location. Our evaluation of retinal tissue from FTLD-Tau patients confirms ONL loss seen antemortem by OCT. Continued investigation of ONL thinning as a biomarker that may distinguish FTLD-Tau from other dementias is warranted."
"Peripheral administration (oral, intranasal, intraperitoneal, intravenous) of assembled A53T &#x3b1;-synuclein induced synucleinopathy in heterozygous mice transgenic for human mutant A53T &#x3b1;-synuclein (line M83). The same was the case when cerebellar extracts from a case of multiple system atrophy with type II &#x3b1;-synuclein filaments were administered intraperitoneally, intravenously or intramuscularly. We observed abundant immunoreactivity for pS129 &#x3b1;-synuclein in nerve cells and severe motor impairment, resulting in hindlimb paralysis and shortened lifespan. Filaments immunoreactive for pS129 &#x3b1;-synuclein were in evidence. A 70% loss of motor neurons was present five months after an intraperitoneal injection of assembled A53T &#x3b1;-synuclein or cerebellar extract with type II &#x3b1;-synuclein filaments from an individual with a neuropathologically confirmed diagnosis of multiple system atrophy. Microglial cells changed from a predominantly ramified to a dystrophic appearance. Taken together, these findings establish a close relationship between the formation of &#x3b1;-synuclein inclusions in nerve cells and neurodegeneration, accompanied by a shift in microglial cell morphology. Propagation of &#x3b1;-synuclein inclusions depended on the characteristics of both seeds and transgenically expressed protein."
"Previous reports indicate a potential role for signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) processing and neuritic plaque pathogenesis. In the present study, the impact of STAT3 inhibition on cognition, cerebrovascular function, amyloid pathology, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation was studied using in vitro and in vivo models of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related pathology. For in vitro experiments, human brain vascular smooth muscle cells (HBVSMC) and human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) were used, and these cultured cells were exposed to A&#x3b2; peptides followed by measurement of activated forms of STAT3 expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Further, 6&#xa0;months old 5XFAD/APOE4 (5XE4) mice and age-matched negative littermates were used for in vivo experiments. These mice were treated with STAT3 specific inhibitor, LLL-12 for 2&#xa0;months followed by neurobehavioral and histopathological assessment. In vitro experiments showed exposure of cerebrovascular cells to A&#x3b2; peptides upregulated activated forms of STAT3 and produced STAT3-mediated vascular oxidative stress. 5XE4 mice treated with the STAT3-specific inhibitor (LLL-12) improved cognitive functions and functional connectivity and augmented cerebral blood flow. These functional improvements were associated with a reduction in neuritic plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Reduction in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and attenuation of oxidative modification of lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP-1) were identified as potential underlying mechanisms. These results demonstrate the broad impact of STAT3 on cognitive functions, parenchymal and vascular amyloid pathology and highlight the therapeutic potential of STAT3 specific inhibition for treatment of AD and CAA."
"Primary spinal cord tumors contribute to&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;10% of central nervous system tumors in individuals of pediatric or adolescent age. Among intramedullary tumors, spinal ependymomas make up&#x2009;~&#x2009;30% of this rare tumor population. A twelve-year-old male presented with an intradural, extramedullary mass occupying the dorsal spinal canal from C6 through T2. Gross total resection and histopathology revealed a World Health Organization (WHO) grade 2 ependymoma. He recurred eleven months later with extension from C2 through T1-T2. Subtotal resection was achieved followed by focal proton beam irradiation and chemotherapy. Histopathology was consistent with WHO grade 3 ependymoma. Molecular profiling of the primary and recurrent tumors revealed a novel amplification of the MYC (8q24) gene, which was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization studies. Although MYC amplification in spinal ependymoma is exceedingly rare, a newly described classification of spinal ependymoma harboring MYCN (2p24) amplification (SP-MYCN) has been defined by DNA methylation-array based profiling. These individuals typically present with a malignant progression and dismal outcomes, contrary to the universally excellent survival outcomes seen in other spinal ependymomas. DNA methylation array-based classification confidently classified this tumor as SP-MYCN ependymoma. Notably, among the cohort of 52 tumors comprising the SP-MYCN methylation class, none harbor MYC amplification, highlighting the rarity of this genomic amplification in spinal ependymoma. A literature review comparing our individual to reported SP-MYCN tumors (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;26) revealed similarities in clinical, histopathologic, and molecular features. Thus, we provide evidence from a single case to support the inclusion of MYC amplified spinal ependymoma within the molecular subgroup of SP-MYCN."
"Amyloid beta (A&#x3b2;) is thought to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prion-like A&#x3b2; polymorphs, or ""strains"", can have varying pathogenicity and may underlie the phenotypic heterogeneity of the disease. In order to develop effective AD therapies, it is critical to identify the strains of A&#x3b2; that might arise prior to the onset of clinical symptoms and understand how they may change with progressing disease. Down syndrome (DS), as the most common genetic cause of AD, presents promising opportunities to compare such features between early and advanced AD. In this work, we evaluate the neuropathology and A&#x3b2; strain profile in the post-mortem brain tissues of 210 DS, AD, and control individuals. We assayed the levels of various A&#x3b2; and tau species and used conformation-sensitive fluorescent probes to detect differences in A&#x3b2; strains among individuals and populations. We found that these cohorts have some common but also some distinct strains from one another, with the most heterogeneous populations of A&#x3b2; emerging in subjects with high levels of AD pathology. The emergence of distinct strains in DS at these later stages of disease suggests that the confluence of aging, pathology, and other DS-linked factors may favor conditions that generate strains that are unique from sporadic AD."
"Haploinsufficiency of chromosome 17p and c-Myc amplification distinguish group 3 medulloblastomas which are associated with&#xa0;early metastasis, rapid recurrence, and swift mortality. Tumor suppressor genes on this locus have not been adequately characterized. We elucidated the role of miR-212-3p in the pathophysiology of group 3 tumors. First, we learned that miR-212-3p undergoes epigenetic silencing by histone modifications in group 3 tumors.&#xa0;Restoring&#xa0;its expression reduced cancer cell proliferation, migration, colony formation, and wound healing in vitro and attenuated tumor burden and improved survival in vivo. MiR-212-3p also triggered c-Myc destabilization and degradation, leading to elevated apoptosis. We then isolated an oncogenic target of miR-212-3p, i.e. NFIB, a nuclear transcription factor implicated in metastasis and recurrence in various cancers. Increased expression of NFIB was confirmed in group 3 tumors and associated with poor survival. NFIB silencing&#xa0;reduced cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Concurrently, reduced medullosphere formation and stem cell markers (Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, CD133) were noted. These results substantiate the tumor-suppressive role of miR-212-3p in group 3&#xa0;MB and identify a novel oncogenic target implicated in metastasis and tumor recurrence."
"Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with greater risk of dementia. This has been theorised to reflect inequalities in cognitive reserve, healthcare access, lifestyle, and other health factors which may contribute to the clinical manifestation of dementia. We aimed to assess whether area deprivation in the United Kingdom was associated with greater risk or severity of the specific neurodegenerative diseases which lead to dementia in a multi-centre cohort with autopsy assessment. Participants underwent clinical assessment prior to brain tissue donation post-mortem. Each then underwent detailed, standardised neuropathological assessment. National area deprivation statistics were derived for each participant's neighbourhood, for use as a predictor in binary and ordinal logistic models assessing the respective presence and severity of staging of key neuropathological changes, adjusting for theorised confounders. Individuals from among the 20% most deprived neighbourhoods in the United Kingdom had significantly higher neurofibrillary tangle and neuritic plaque staging, and increased risk of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. These findings were not explained by a greater risk of diabetes or hypertension, APOE genotype, alcohol misuse or tobacco smoking, sex, or age differences. A sensitivity analysis conditioning on baseline cognitive impairment did not meaningfully change the observed association. Socioeconomic disadvantage may contribute to dementia incidence through a greater severity of specific neuropathological changes (neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy), independent of other indirect influences. Mechanisms through which deprivation is associated with these require further exploration."
"Apolipoprotein E &#x3b5;4 allele (APOE4) has been shown to associate with increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 mortality in some previous genetic studies, but information on the role of APOE4 on the underlying pathology and parallel clinical manifestations is scarce. Here we studied the genetic association between APOE and COVID-19 in Finnish biobank, autopsy and prospective clinical cohort datasets. In line with previous work, our data on 2611 cases showed that APOE4 carriership associates with severe COVID-19 in intensive care patients compared with non-infected population controls after matching for age, sex and cardiovascular disease status. Histopathological examination of brain autopsy material of 21 COVID-19 cases provided evidence that perivascular microhaemorrhages are more prevalent in APOE4 carriers. Finally, our analysis of post-COVID fatigue in a prospective clinical cohort of 156 subjects revealed that APOE4 carriership independently associates with higher mental fatigue compared to non-carriers at six months after initial illness. In conclusion, the present data on Finns suggests that APOE4 is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 and post-COVID mental fatigue and provides the first indication that some of this effect could be mediated via increased cerebrovascular damage. Further studies in larger cohorts and animal models are warranted."
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system that is characterized by inflammation and focal areas of demyelination, ultimately resulting in axonal degradation and neuronal loss. Several lines of evidence point towards a role for microglia and other brain macrophages in disease initiation and progression, but exactly how lesion formation is triggered is currently unknown. Here, we characterized early changes in MS brain tissue through transcriptomic analysis of normal appearing white matter (NAWM). We found that NAWM was characterized by enriched expression of genes associated with inflammation and cellular stress derived from brain macrophages. Single cell RNA sequencing confirmed a stress response in brain macrophages in NAWM and identified specific microglia and macrophage subsets at different stages of demyelinating lesions. We identified both phagocytic/activated microglia and CAM clusters that were associated with various MS lesion types. These overall changes in microglia and macrophages associated with lesion development in MS brain tissue may provide therapeutic targets to limit lesion progression and demyelination."
"Recent studies highlight phosphorylated tau (p-tau) at threonine tau 217 (p-tau217) as a new promising plasma biomarker for pathological changes implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the specific brain pathological events related to the alteration in p-tau217 plasma levels are still largely unknown. Using immunostaining techniques of postmortem AD brain tissue, we show that p-tau217 is found in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuropil threads that are also positive for p-tau181, 202, 202/205, 231, and 369/404. The p-tau217, but not the other five p-tau variants, was also prominently seen in vesicles structure positive for markers of granulovacuolar degeneration bodies and multi-vesicular bodies. Further, individuals with a high likelihood of AD showed significantly higher p-tau217 area fraction in 4 different brain areas (entorhinal cortex, inferior temporal gyrus, and superior frontal gyrus) compared to those with Primary age related tauopathy or other non-AD tauopathies. The p-tau217 area fraction correlated strongly with total amyloid-beta (A&#x3b2;) and NFT brain load when the whole group was analyzed. Finally, the mean p-tau217 area fraction correlated&#xa0;significantly with p-tau217 concentrations in antemortem collected plasma specifically in individuals with amyloid plaques and not in those&#xa0;without amyloid plaques. These studies highlight differences in cellular localization of different p-tau variants and suggest that plasma levels of p-tau217 reflect an accumulation of p-tau217 in presence of A&#x3b2; plaque load."
"Uniaxial stretch is believed to drive diffuse axonal injury (DAI) in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Axonal varicosities are enlarged structures along axonal shafts and represent a hallmark feature of DAI. Here we report that axonal varicosities initiate in vivo immediately after head impact and are mainly induced by transverse compression but not uniaxial stretch. Vertical and lateral impacts to the mouse head induced axonal varicosities in distinct brain regions before any changes of microglial markers. Varicosities preferentially formed along axons perpendicular to impact direction. In cultured neurons, whereas 50% uniaxial strain was needed to rapidly induce axonal varicosities in a nanowrinkled stretch assay, physiologically-relevant transverse compression effectively induced axonal varicosities in a fluid puffing assay and can generate large but nonuniform deformation simulated by finite element analysis. Therefore, impact strength and direction may determine the threshold and spatial pattern of axonal varicosity initiation, respectively, partially resulting from intrinsic properties of axon mechanosensation."
"Clinical trials of therapeutics for traumatic brain injury (TBI) demonstrating preclinical efficacy for TBI have failed to replicate these results in humans, in part due to the absence of clinically feasible therapeutic windows for administration. Minocycline, an inhibitor of microglial activation, has been shown to be neuroprotective when administered early after experimental TBI but detrimental when administered chronically to human TBI survivors. Rather than focusing on the rescue of primary injury with early administration of therapeutics which may not be clinically feasible, we hypothesized that minocycline administered at a clinically feasible time point (24&#xa0;h after injury) would be neuroprotective in a model of TBI plus delayed hypoxemia. We first explored several different regimens of minocycline dosing with the initial dose 24&#xa0;h after injury and 2&#xa0;h prior to hypoxemia, utilizing short-term neuropathology to select the most promising candidate. We found that a short course of minocycline reduced acute microglial activation, monocyte infiltration and hippocampal neuronal loss at 1&#xa0;week post injury. We then conducted a preclinical trial to assess the long-term efficacy of a short course of minocycline finding reductions in hippocampal neurodegeneration and synapse loss, preservation of white matter myelination, and improvements in fear memory performance at 6&#xa0;months after injury. Timing in relation to injury and duration of minocycline treatment and its impact on neuroinflammatory response may be responsible for extensive neuroprotection observed in our studies."
"GNAO1 encephalopathy characterized by a wide spectrum of neurological deficiencies in pediatric patients originates from de novo heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding G&#x3b1;o, the major neuronal G protein. Efficient treatments and even the proper understanding of the underlying etiology are currently lacking for this dominant disease. Adequate animal models of GNAO1 encephalopathy are urgently needed. Here we describe establishment and characterization of mouse models of the disease based on two point mutations in GNAO1 with different clinical manifestations. One of them is G203R leading to the early-onset epileptic seizures, motor dysfunction, developmental delay and intellectual disability. The other is C215Y producing much milder clinical outcomes, mostly-late-onset hyperkinetic movement disorder. The resultant mouse models show distinct phenotypes: severe neonatal lethality in GNAO1[G203R]/&#x2009;+&#x2009;mice vs. normal vitality in GNAO1[C215Y]/&#x2009;+&#x2009;. The latter model further revealed strong hyperactivity and hyperlocomotion in a panel of behavioral assays, without signs of epilepsy, recapitulating the patients' manifestations. Importantly, despite these differences the two models similarly revealed prenatal brain developmental anomalies, such as enlarged lateral ventricles and decreased numbers of neuronal precursor cells in the cortex. Thus, our work unveils GNAO1 encephalopathy as to a large extent neurodevelopmental malady. We expect that this understanding and the tools we established will be instrumental for future therapeutic developments."
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events. Ischemic stroke in COVID-19 patients entails high severity and mortality rates. Here we aimed to analyze cerebral thrombi of COVID-19 patients with large vessel occlusion&#xa0;(LVO) acute ischemic stroke to expose molecular evidence for SARS-CoV-2 in the thrombus and to unravel any peculiar immune-thrombotic features. We conducted a systematic pathological analysis of cerebral thrombi retrieved by endovascular thrombectomy in patients with LVO stroke infected with COVID-19 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7 patients) and non-covid LVO controls (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;23). In thrombi of COVID-19 patients, the SARS-CoV-2 docking receptor ACE2 was mainly expressed in monocytes/macrophages and showed higher expression levels compared to controls. Using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing, we detected SARS-CoV-2 Clade20A, in the thrombus of one COVID-19 patient. Comparing thrombus composition of COVID-19 and control patients, we noted no overt differences in terms of red blood cells, fibrin, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), von Willebrand Factor (vWF), platelets and complement complex C5b-9. However, thrombi of COVID-19 patients showed increased neutrophil density (MPO<sup>+</sup> cells) and a three-fold higher Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (tNLR). In the ROC analysis both neutrophils and tNLR had a good discriminative ability to differentiate thrombi of COVID-19 patients from controls. In summary, cerebral thrombi of COVID-19 patients can harbor SARS-CoV2 and are characterized by an increased neutrophil number and tNLR and higher ACE2 expression. These findings suggest neutrophils as the possible culprit in COVID-19-related thrombosis."
"Cisplatin is used to combat solid tumors. However, patients treated with cisplatin often develop cognitive impairments, sensorimotor deficits, and peripheral neuropathy. There is no FDA-approved treatment for these neurotoxicities. We investigated the capacity of a highly selective A<sub>3</sub> adenosine receptor (AR) subtype (A<sub>3</sub>AR) agonist, MRS5980, to prevent and reverse cisplatin-induced neurotoxicities. MRS5980 prevented cisplatin-induced cognitive impairment (decreased executive function and impaired spatial and working memory), sensorimotor deficits, and neuropathic pain (mechanical allodynia and spontaneous pain) in both sexes. At the structural level, MRS5980 prevented the cisplatin-induced reduction in markers of synaptic integrity. In-situ hybridization detected Adora3 mRNA in neurons, microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. RNAseq analysis identified 164 genes, including genes related to mitochondrial function, of which expression was changed by cisplatin and normalized by MRS5980. Consistently, MRS5980 prevented cisplatin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased signs of oxidative stress. Transcriptomic analysis showed that the A<sub>3</sub>AR agonist upregulates genes related to repair pathways including NOTCH1 signaling and chromatin modification in the cortex of cisplatin-treated mice. Importantly, A<sub>3</sub>AR agonist administration after completion of cisplatin treatment resolved cognitive impairment, neuropathy and sensorimotor deficits. Our results highlight the efficacy of a selective A<sub>3</sub>AR agonist to prevent and reverse cisplatin-induced neurotoxicities via preventing brain mitochondrial damage and activating repair pathways. An A<sub>3</sub>AR agonist is already in cancer, clinical trials and our results demonstrate management of neurotoxic side effects of chemotherapy as an additional therapeutic benefit."
"One of the therapeutic approaches for the treatment of the autoimmune demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis (MS) is bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell (hBM-MSCs) transplantation. However, given their capacity to enhance myelination in vitro, we hypothesised that human olfactory mucosa-derived MSCs (hOM-MSCs) may possess additional properties suitable for CNS repair. Herein, we have examined the efficacy of hOM-MSCs versus hBM-MSCs using the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. Both MSC types ameliorated disease, if delivered during the initial onset of symptomatic disease. Yet, only hOM-MSCs improved disease outcome if administered during established disease when animals had severe neurological deficits. Histological analysis of spinal cord lesions revealed hOM-MSC transplantation reduced blood-brain barrier disruption and inflammatory cell recruitment and enhanced axonal survival. At early time points post-hOM-MSC treatment, animals had reduced levels of circulating IL-16, which was reflected in both the ability of immune cells to secrete IL-16 and the level of IL-16 in spinal cord inflammatory lesions. Further in vitro investigation revealed an inhibitory role for IL-16 on oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. Moreover, the availability of bioactive IL-16 after demyelination was reduced in the presence of hOM-MSCs. Combined, our data suggests that human hOM-MSCs may have therapeutic benefit in the treatment of MS via an IL-16-mediated pathway, especially if administered during active demyelination and inflammation."
"A novel DNA methylation class of tumor within the central nervous system, the ""neuroepithelial tumor (NET), PATZ1 fusion-positive"" has recently been identified in the literature, characterized by EWSR1- and MN1-PATZ1 fusions. The cellular origin of this tumor type remains unknown, wavering between glioneuronal or mesenchymal (as round cell sarcomas with EWSR1-PATZ1 of the soft tissue). Because of the low number of reported cases, this tumor type will not be added to the 2021 World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System (CNS). Herein, we report one case of a CNS tumor classified by DNA methylation analysis as NET-PATZ1 but harboring a novel LARGE1-AFF2 fusion which has until now never been described in soft tissue or the CNS. We compare its clinical, histopathological, immunophenotypical, and genetic features with those previously described in NET-PATZ1. Interestingly, the current case presented histopathological (astroblastoma-like features, glioneuronal phenotype), clinical (with a favorable course), genetic (1p loss), and epigenetic (DNA-methylation profiling) similarities to previously reported cases of NET-PATZ1. Our results added data suggesting that different histomolecular tumor subtypes seem to be included within the methylation class ""NET, PATZ1 fusion-positive"", including non PATZ1 fusions, and that further cases are needed to better characterize them."
"The descriptions of muscle pathology in dysferlinopathy patients have classically included an inflammatory infiltrate that can mimic inflammatory myopathies. Based on over 20&#xa0;years of institutional experience in evaluating dystrophic and inflammatory myopathy muscle biopsies at the University of Iowa, we hypothesized the inflammatory histopathology of dysferlinopathy is more similar to limb-girdle pattern muscular dystrophies such as calpainopathy and Becker muscular dystrophy, and distinct from true inflammatory myopathies. Muscle biopsies from 32 dysferlinopathy, 30 calpainopathy, 30 Becker muscular dystrophy, and 30 inflammatory myopathies (15 each of dermatomyositis and inclusion body myositis) were analyzed through digital quantitation of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, and PU.1 immunostaining. The expression of MHC class I and deposition of complement C5b-9 was also evaluated. Dysferlinopathy, calpainopathy, and Becker muscular dystrophy muscle biopsies had similar numbers of inflammatory cell infiltrates and significantly fewer CD3+ T-lymphocytes than dermatomyositis (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05) and inclusion body myositis (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) biopsies. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of PU.1+ macrophages identified in any diagnostic group. MHC class I expression was significantly lower in the limb-girdle pattern muscular dystrophies compared to the inflammatory myopathies (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). In contrast, complement C5b-9 deposition was similar among dysferlinopathy, dermatomyositis, and inclusion body myositis biopsies but significantly greater than calpainopathy and Becker muscular dystrophy biopsies (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.05). Compared to calpainopathy, Becker muscular dystrophy, and inflammatory myopathies, the unique profile of minimal inflammatory cell infiltrates, absent to focal MHC class I, and diffuse myofiber complement C5b-9 deposition is the pathologic signature of dysferlinopathy muscle biopsies."
"Folliculostellate cells are S100B-expressing cells with numerous functions in the normal anterior pituitary. These cells have also been identified in pituitary neuroendocrine tumours (PitNETs), where their precise role remains elusive. Here, we aimed to build a refined cartography of S100B-expressing cells to characterise their interpatient and intratumoural spatial distribution, and to start identifying their potential functions in PitNETs. High-throughput histological analysis of S100B-stained tumour sections of 54 PitNETs revealed a significant decrease in S100B&#x2009;+&#x2009;cells in PitNETs compared to the normal anterior pituitary. A Ki67 index&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;3, a mitosis count&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;2/10 per high power fields, and a proliferative status, were all associated with fewer S100B&#x2009;+&#x2009;cells in gonadotroph tumours. Gonadotroph tumours also showed interpatient and intratumoural heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of S100B&#x2009;+&#x2009;cells. The existence of an intratumoural heterogeneity was further confirmed by the incorporation to our spatial analysis of additional markers: Ki67, FSH, LH, ER&#x3b1; and SSTR2. The tumour areas with fewer S100B&#x2009;+&#x2009;cells displayed a higher percentage of Ki67&#x2009;+&#x2009;cells, whereas strong positive correlations were observed between S100B&#x2009;+&#x2009;, FSH&#x2009;+&#x2009;, and ER&#x3b1;&#x2009;+&#x2009;cells. Such spatial associations suggest that S100B&#x2009;+&#x2009;folliculostellate cells could play a role in gonadotroph tumorigenesis, and may contribute to the maintenance of tumour cells in a low proliferating, FSH&#x2009;+&#x2009;/ER&#x3b1;&#x2009;+&#x2009;differentiated state. Albeit, further in-depth functional studies are required to decipher the mechanisms underlying these spatial associations and to potentially identify a therapeutic use."
"Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) or Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is the most common form of dominant SCA worldwide. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) provide promising non-invasive diagnostic and follow-up tools, also serving to evaluate therapies efficacy. However, pre-clinical studies showing relationship between MRI-MRS based biomarkers and functional performance are missing, which hampers an efficient clinical translation of therapeutics. This study assessed motor behaviour, neurochemical profiles, and morphometry of the cerebellum of MJD transgenic mice and patients aiming at establishing magnetic-resonance-based biomarkers. <sup>1</sup>H-MRS and structural MRI measurements of MJD transgenic mice were performed with a 9.4&#xa0;Tesla scanner, correlated with motor performance on rotarod and compared with data collected from human patients. We found decreased cerebellar white and grey matter and enlargement of the fourth ventricle in both MJD mice and human patients as compared to controls. N-acetylaspartate (NAA), NAA&#x2009;+&#x2009;N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAA&#x2009;+&#x2009;NAAG), Glutamate, and Taurine, were significantly decreased in MJD mouse cerebellum regardless of age, whereas myo-Inositol (Ins) was increased at early time-points. Lower neurochemical ratios levels (NAA/Ins and NAA/total Choline), previously correlated with worse clinical status in SCAs, were also observed in MJD mice cerebella. NAA, NAA&#x2009;+&#x2009;NAAG, Glutamate, and Taurine were also positively correlated with MJD mice motor performance. Importantly, these <sup>1</sup>H-MRS results were largely analogous to those found for MJD in human studies and in our pilot data in human patients. We have established a magnetic resonance-based biomarker approach to monitor novel therapies in preclinical studies and human clinical trials."
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major adult-onset neurodegenerative condition with no available treatment. Compelling reports point amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) as the main etiologic agent that triggers AD. Although there is extensive evidence of detrimental crosstalk between A&#x3b2; and microglia that contributes to neuroinflammation in AD, the exact mechanism leading to neuron death remains unknown. Using postmortem human AD brain tissue, we show that A&#x3b2; pathology is associated with the necroptosis effector pMLKL. Moreover, we found that the burden of A&#x3b2; oligomers (A&#x3b2;o) correlates with the expression of key markers of necroptosis activation. Additionally, inhibition of necroptosis by pharmacological or genetic means, reduce neurodegeneration and memory impairment triggered by A&#x3b2;o in mice. Since microglial activation is emerging as a central driver for AD pathogenesis, we then tested the contribution of microglia to the mechanism of A&#x3b2;o-mediated necroptosis activation in neurons. Using an in vitro model, we show that conditioned medium from A&#x3b2;o-stimulated microglia elicited necroptosis in neurons through activation of TNF-&#x3b1; signaling, triggering extensive neurodegeneration. Notably, necroptosis inhibition provided significant neuronal protection. Together, these findings suggest that A&#x3b2;o-mediated microglia stimulation in AD contributes to necroptosis activation in neurons and neurodegeneration. As necroptosis is a druggable degenerative mechanism, our findings might have important therapeutic implications to prevent the progression of AD."
"Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by the presence of eosinophilic inclusions (NIIs) within nuclei of central and peripheral nervous system cells. This study aims to identify the components of NIIs, which have been difficult to analyze directly due to their insolubility. In order to establish a method to directly identify the components of NIIs, we first analyzed the huntingtin inclusion-rich fraction obtained from the brains of Huntington disease model mice. Although the sequence with expanded polyglutamine could not be identified by liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry, amino acid analysis revealed that glutamine of the huntingtin inclusion-rich fraction increased significantly. This is compatible with the calculated amino acid content of the transgene product. Therefore, we applied this method to analyze the NIIs of diseased human brains, which may have proteins with compositionally biased regions, and identified a serine-rich protein called hornerin. Since the analyzed NII-rich fraction was also serine-rich, we suggested hornerin as a major component of the NIIs. A specific distribution of hornerin in NIID was also investigated by Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry and immunofluorescence. Finally, we confirmed a variant of hornerin by whole-exome sequencing and DNA sequencing. This study suggests that hornerin may be related to the pathological process of this NIID, and the direct analysis of NIIs, especially by amino acid analysis using the NII-rich fractions, would contribute to a deeper understanding of the disease pathogenesis."
"TMEM106B, a type II lysosomal transmembrane protein, has recently been associated with brain aging, hypomyelinating leukodystrophy, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and several other brain disorders. TMEM106B is critical for proper lysosomal function and TMEM106B deficiency leads to myelination defects, FTLD related pathology, and motor coordination deficits in mice. However, the physiological and pathological functions of TMEM106B in the brain are still not well understood. In this study, we investigate the role of TMEM106B in the cerebellum, dysfunction of which has been associated with FTLD and other brain disorders. We found that TMEM106B is ubiquitously expressed in neurons in the cerebellum, with the highest levels in the Purkinje neurons. Aged TMEM106B-deficient mice show significant loss of Purkinje neurons specifically in the anterior lobe of the cerebellum. Increased microglia and astrocyte activation, as well as an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, p62 and TDP-43 were also detected in the cerebellum of aged TMEM106B deficient mice. In the young mice, myelination defects and a significant loss of synapses between Purkinje and deep cerebellar nuclei neurons were observed. Interestingly, TMEM106B deficiency causes distinct lysosomal phenotypes in different types of neurons and glia in the cerebellum and frontal cortex. In humans, TMEM106B rs1990622 risk allele (T/T) is associated with increased Purkinje neuron loss. Taken together, our studies support that TMEM106B regulates lysosomal function in a cell-type-specific manner and TMEM106B is critical for maintaining synaptic integrity and neural functions in the cerebellum."
"Classification of gliomas involves the combination of histological features with molecular biomarkers to establish an integrated histomolecular diagnosis. Here, we report on the application and validation of a set of molecular assays for glioma diagnostics based on digital PCR technology using the QX200&#x2122; Droplet Digital&#x2122; PCR (ddPCR) system. The investigated ddPCR-based assays enable the detection of diagnostically relevant glioma-associated mutations in the IDH1, IDH2, H3-3A, BRAF, and PRKCA genes, as well as in the TERT promoter. In addition, ddPCR-based assays assessing diagnostically relevant copy number alterations were studied, including 1p/19q codeletion, gain of chromosome 7 and loss of chromosome 10 (+&#x2009;7/-10), EGFR amplification, duplication of the BRAF locus, and CDKN2A homozygous deletion. Results obtained by ddPCR were validated by other methods, including immunohistochemistry, Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing, microsatellite analyses for loss of heterozygosity, as well as real-time PCR- or microarray-based copy number assays. Particular strengths of the ddPCR approach are (1) its high analytical sensitivity allowing for reliable detection of mutations even with low mutant allele frequencies, (2) its quantitative determination of mutant allele frequencies and copy number changes, and (3) its rapid generation of results within a single day. Thus, in line with other recent studies our findings support ddPCR analysis as a valuable approach for molecular glioma diagnostics in a fast, quantitative and highly sensitive manner."
"Pediatric high-grade gliomas, specifically diffuse midline gliomas, account for only 20% of clinical cases but are 100% fatal. A majority of the DMG cases are characterized by the signature K27M mutation in histone H3. The H3K27M mutation opposes the function of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), the methyltransferase enzyme of the polycomb repressor complex 2. However, the role of EZH2 in DMG pathogenesis is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate a tumor suppressor function for EZH2 using Ezh2 loss- and gain-of-function studies in H3WT DMG mouse models. Genetic ablation of Ezh2 increased cell proliferation and tumor grade while expression of an Ezh2 gain-of-function mutation significantly reduced tumor incidence and increased tumor latency. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Ezh2 deletion upregulates an inflammatory response with upregulation of immunoproteasome genes such as Psmb8, Psmb9, and Psmb10. Ezh2 gain-of-function resulted in enrichment of the oxidative phosphorylation/mitochondrial metabolic pathway namely the isocitrate dehydrogenase Idh1/2/3 genes. Pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 augmented neural progenitor cell proliferation, supporting the tumor suppressive role of EZH2. In vivo 7-day treatment of H3K27M DMG tumor bearing mice with an EZH2 inhibitor, Tazemetostat, did not alter proliferation or significantly impact survival. Together our results suggest that EZH2 has a tumor suppressor function in DMG and warrants caution in clinical translation of EZH2 inhibitors to treat patients with DMG."
"Recent studies suggest that metabolic changes and oxygen deficiency in the central nervous system play an important role in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS). In our present study, we investigated the changes in oxygenation and analyzed the vascular perfusion of the spinal cord in a rodent model of MS. We performed multispectral optoacoustic tomography of the lumbar spinal cord before and after an oxygen enhancement challenge in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for MS. In addition, mice were transcardially perfused with lectin to label the vasculature and their spinal columns were optically cleared, followed by light sheet fluorescence microscopy. To analyze the angioarchitecture of the intact spine, we used VesSAP, a novel deep learning-based framework. In EAE mice, the spinal cord had lower oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration compared to healthy mice, indicating compromised perfusion of the spinal cord. Oxygen administration reversed hypoxia in the spinal cord of EAE mice, although the ventral region remained hypoxic. Additionally, despite the increased vascular density, we report a reduction in length and complexity of the perfused vascular network in EAE. Taken together, these findings highlight a new aspect of neuroinflammatory pathology, revealing a significant degree of hypoxia in EAE in vivo that is accompanied by changes in spinal vascular perfusion. The study also introduces optoacoustic imaging as a tractable technique with the potential to further decipher the role of hypoxia in EAE and to monitor it in MS patients."
"Previous studies show that 3&#x3b2;-hydroxysterol-&#x394;24 reductase (DHCR24) has a remarked decline in the brain of AD patients. In brain cholesterol synthetic metabolism, DHCR24 is known as the heavily key synthetase in cholesterol synthesis. Moreover, mutations of DHCR24 gene result in inhibition of the enzymatic activity of DHCR24, causing brain cholesterol deficiency and desmosterol accumulation. Furthermore, in vitro studies also demonstrated that DHCR24 knockdown lead to the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, and the decrease of plasma membrane cholesterol and intracellular cholesterol level. Obviously, DHCR24 could play a crucial role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis via the control of cholesterol synthesis. Over the past two decades, accumulating data suggests that DHCR24 activity is downregulated by major risk factors for AD, suggesting a potential link between DHCR24 downregulation and AD pathogenesis. Thus, the brain cholesterol loss seems to be induced by the major risk factors for AD, suggesting a possible causative link between brain cholesterol loss and AD. According to previous data and our study, we further found that the reduced cholesterol level in plasma membrane and intracellular compartments by the deficiency of DHCR24 activity obviously was involved in &#x3b2;-amyloid generation, tau hyperphosphorylation, apoptosis. Importantly, increasing evidences reveal that the brain cholesterol loss and lipid raft disorganization are obviously linked to neuropathological impairments which are associated with AD pathogenesis. Therefore, based on previous data and research on DHCR24, we suppose that the brain cholesterol deficiency/loss might be involved in the pathogenesis of AD."
"Diffusely infiltrating gliomas are among the most common central nervous system tumors in adults. Over the past decade, the subcategorization of these tumors has changed to include both traditional histologic features and more recently identified molecular factors. However, one molecular feature that has yet to be integrated is the presence/absence of chromosomal instability (CIN). Herein, we use global methylation profiling to evaluate a reference cohort of IDH-mutant astrocytomas with and without prior evidence of CIN (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;42), and apply the resulting methylation-based characteristics to a larger test cohort of publicly-available IDH-mutant astrocytomas (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;245). We demonstrate that IDH-mutant astrocytomas with evidence of CIN cluster separately from their chromosomally-stable counterparts. CIN cases were associated with higher initial histologic grade, altered expression patterns of genes related to CIN in other cancers, elevated initial total copy number burden, and significantly worse progression-free and overall survival. In addition, in a grade-for-grade analysis, patients with CIN-positive WHO grade 2 and 3 tumors had significantly worse survival. These results suggest that global methylation profiling can be used to discriminate between chromosomally stable and unstable IDH-mutant astrocytomas, and may therefore provide a reliable and cost-effective method for identifying gliomas with chromosomal instability and resultant poor clinical outcome."
"We present the case of a 41-year-old man who developed worsening mid-thoracic back pain and imaging revealed a well-circumscribed intramedullary tumor in the thoracic spinal cord. Subtotal resection was performed, and histopathological analysis showed a cytologically bland, minimally proliferative glial neoplasm. Sequencing revealed H3 K27M and an activating PTPN11 mutation. Serial imaging revealed slow tumor regrowth over a three year period which prompted a second resection. The recurrent tumor displayed a similar low grade-appearing histology and harbored the same H3 K27M and PTPN11 mutations as the primary. While the prognostic importance of isolated H3 K27M in spinal gliomas is well-known, the combination of these two mutations in spinal low grade glioma has not been previously reported. Importantly, PTPN11 is a component of the MAPK signaling pathway. Thus, as building evidence shows that low grade-appearing gliomas harboring H3 K27M mutations along with BRAF or FGFR1 mutations have a relatively more favorable course compared to isolated H3 K27M-mutant midline gliomas, the present case provides new evidence for the prognostic importance of activating mutations in other components of the MAPK signaling pathway. This case further highlights the importance of clinico-radio-pathologic correlation when incorporating evolving genetic data into the integrated diagnosis of rare neuroepithelial tumors."
"The adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily A member 7 gene (ABCA7) is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in large genome-wide association studies. Targeted sequencing of ABCA7 suggests a role for rare premature termination codon (PTC) mutations in AD, with haploinsufficiency through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay as a plausible pathogenic mechanism. Since other classes of rare variants in ABCA7 are poorly understood, we investigated the contribution and pathogenicity of rare missense, indel and splice variants in ABCA7 in Belgian AD patient and control cohorts. We identified 8.36% rare variants in the patient cohort versus 6.05% in the control cohort. For 10 missense mutations identified in the Belgian cohort we analyzed the pathogenetic effect on protein localization in vitro using immunocytochemistry. Our results demonstrate that rare ABCA7 missense mutations can contribute to AD by inducing protein mislocalization, resulting in a lack of functional protein at the plasma membrane. In one pedigree, a mislocalization-inducing missense mutation in ABCA7 (p.G1820S) co-segregated with AD in an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Brain autopsy of six patient missense mutation carriers showed typical AD neuropathological characteristics including cerebral amyloid angiopathy type 1. Also, among the rare ABCA7 missense mutations, we observed mutations that affect amino acid residues that are conserved in ABCA1 and ABCA4, of which some correspond to established ABCA1 or ABCA4 disease-causing mutations involved in Tangier or Stargardt disease."
"Tau accumulation is clearly linked to pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease and other Tauopathies. However, processes leading to Tau fibrillization and reasons for its pathogenicity remain largely elusive. Mical emerged as a novel interacting protein of human Tau expressed in Drosophila brains. Mical is characterized by the presence of a flavoprotein monooxygenase domain that generates redox potential with which it can oxidize target proteins. In the well-established Drosophila Tauopathy model, we use genetic interactions to show that Mical alters Tau interactions with microtubules and the Actin cytoskeleton and greatly affects Tau aggregation propensity and Tau-associated toxicity and dysfunction. Exploration of the mechanism was pursued using a Mical inhibitor, a mutation in Mical that selectively disrupts its monooxygenase domain, Tau transgenes mutated at cysteine residues targeted by Mical and mass spectrometry analysis to quantify cysteine oxidation. The collective evidence strongly indicates that Mical's redox activity mediates the effects on Tau via oxidation of Cys322. Importantly, we also validate results from the fly model in human Tauopathy samples by showing that MICAL1 is up-regulated in patient brains and co-localizes with Tau in Pick bodies. Our work provides mechanistic insights into the role of the Tau cysteine residues as redox-switches regulating the process of Tau self-assembly into inclusions in vivo, its function as a cytoskeletal protein and its effect on neuronal toxicity and dysfunction."
"The mechanisms by which vertically transmitted Zika virus (ZIKV) causes postnatal brain development abnormalities and congenital disease remain poorly understood. Here, we optimized the established anti-IFNAR1 treated, Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> (AIR) mouse model of ZIKV infection to examine the consequence of vertical transmission on neonate survival and postnatal brain development. We found that modulating the infectious dose and the frequency of anti-IFNAR1 treatment of pregnant mice (termed AIR<sup>low</sup> mice) prolonged neonatal survival allowing for pathogenesis studies of brain tissues at critical postnatal time points. Postnatal AIR<sup>low</sup> mice all had chronic ZIKV infection in the brain that was associated with decreased cortical thickness and cerebellar volume, increased gliosis, and higher levels of cell death in many brain areas including cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum when compared to controls. Interestingly, despite active infection and brain abnormalities, the neurodevelopmental program remained active in AIR<sup>low</sup> mice as indicated by elevated mRNA expression of critical neurodevelopmental genes in the brain and enlargement of neural-progenitor rich regions of the cerebellum at a developmental time point analogous to birth in humans. Nevertheless, around the developmental time point when the brain is fully populated by neurons, AIR<sup>low</sup> mice developed neurologic disease associated with persistent ZIKV infection in the brain, gliosis, and increased cell death. Together, these data show that vertically transmitted ZIKV infection in the brain of postnatal AIR<sup>low</sup> mice strongly influences brain development resulting in structural abnormalities and cell death in multiple regions of the brain."
"Risk factors such as dysregulation of Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling have been linked to Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 5 (Igfbp5), an inhibitory binding protein for insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf-1) accumulates in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and in amyloid plaques in brains of Alzheimer patients. We investigated the pathogenic relevance of this finding with transgenic mice overexpressing Igfbp5 in pyramidal neurons of the brain. Neuronal overexpression of Igfbp5 prevents the training-induced increase of hippocampal and cortical Bdnf expression and reduces the effects of exercise on memory retention, but not on learning acquisition. Hence, elevated IGFBP5 expression could be responsible for some of the early cognitive deficits that occur during the course of Alzheimer's disease."
"Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is a severe X-linked muscle disease. Age of onset, clinical variability, speed of progression and affected tissues display wide variability, making a clinical trial design for drug development very complex. The histopathological changes in skeletal muscle tissue are central to the pathogenesis, but they have not been thoroughly elucidated yet. Here we analysed muscle biopsies from a large cohort of BMD patients, focusing our attention on the histopathological muscle parameters, as fibrosis, fatty replacement, fibre cross sectional area, necrosis, regenerating fibres, splitting fibres, internalized nuclei and dystrophy evaluation. We correlated histological parameters with both demographic features and clinical functional evaluations. The most interesting results of our study are the accurate quantification of fibroadipose tissue replacement and the identification of some histopathological aspects that well correlate with clinical performances. Through correlation analysis, we divided our patients into three clusters with well-defined histological and clinical features. In conclusion, this is the first study that analyses in detail the histological characteristics of muscle biopsies in a large cohort of BMD patients, correlating them to a functional impairment. The collection of these data help to better understand the histopathological progression of the disease and can be useful to validate any pharmacological trial in which the modification of muscle biopsy is utilized as outcome measure."
"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal muscle-wasting disorder caused by mutations in the Dystrophin gene and for which there is currently no cure. To bridge the gap between preclinical and therapeutic evaluation studies, we have generated a rat model for DMD that carries an exon 52 deletion (R-DMDdel52) causing a complete lack of dystrophin protein. Here we show that R-DMDdel52 animals recapitulated human DMD pathophysiological trajectory more faithfully than the mdx mouse model. We report that R-DMDdel52 rats displayed progressive and severe skeletal muscle loss associated with fibrotic deposition, fat infiltration and fibre type switch. Early fibrosis was also apparent in the cardiac muscle. These histological modifications led to severe muscle, respiratory and cardiac functional impairments leading to premature death around 1&#xa0;year. Moreover, DMD muscle exhibited systemic inflammation with a mixed M1/M2 phenotype. A comparative single cell RNAseq analysis of the diaphragm muscle was performed, revealing cellular populations alteration and molecular modifications in all muscle cell types. We show that DMD fibroadipogenic progenitors produced elevated levels of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, a glycoprotein responsible for modulating homeostasis of extracellular matrix, and whose increased concentration correlated with muscle fibrosis both in R-DMDdel52 rats and human patients. Fibrosis is a component of tissue remodelling impacting the whole musculature of DMD patients, at the tissue level but most importantly at the functional level. We therefore propose that this specific biomarker can optimize the prognostic monitoring of functional improvement of patients included in clinical trials."
"Mutations in the RYR1 gene, encoding ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1), are a well-known cause of Central Core Disease (CCD) and Multi-minicore Disease (MmD). We screened a cohort of 153 patients carrying an histopathological diagnosis of core myopathy (cores and minicores) for RYR1 mutation. At least one RYR1 mutation was identified in 69 of them and these patients were further studied. Clinical and histopathological features were collected. Clinical phenotype was highly heterogeneous ranging from asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic hyperCKemia to severe muscle weakness and skeletal deformity with loss of ambulation. Sixty-eight RYR1 mutations, generally missense, were identified, of which 16 were novel. The combined analysis of the clinical presentation, disease progression and the structural bioinformatic analyses of RYR1 allowed to associate some phenotypes to mutations in specific domains. In addition, this study highlighted the structural bioinformatics potential in the prediction of the pathogenicity of RYR1 mutations. Further improvement in the comprehension of genotype-phenotype relationship of core myopathies can be expected in the next future: the actual lack of the human RyR1 crystal structure paired with the presence of large intrinsically disordered regions in RyR1, and the frequent presence of more than one RYR1 mutation in core myopathy patients, require designing novel investigation strategies to completely address RyR1 mutation effect."
"Exposure to military blast and repetitive head impacts (RHI) in contact sports is associated with increased risk of long-term neurobehavioral sequelae and cognitive deficits, and the neurodegenerative disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). At present, the exact pathogenic mechanisms of RHI and CTE are unknown, and no targeted therapies are available. Astrocytes have recently emerged as key mediators of the multicellular response to head trauma. Here, we investigated interface astrogliosis in blast and impact neurotrauma, specifically in the context of RHI and early stage CTE. We compared postmortem brain tissue from former military veterans with a history of blast exposure with and without a neuropathological diagnosis of CTE, former American football players with a history of RHI with and without a neuropathological diagnosis of CTE, and control donors without a history of blast, RHI exposure or CTE diagnosis. Using quantitative immunofluorescence, we found that astrogliosis was higher at the grey-white matter interface in the dorsolateral frontal cortex, with mixed effects at the subpial surface and underlying cortex, in both blast and RHI donors with and without CTE, compared to controls. These results indicate that certain astrocytic alterations are associated with both impact and blast neurotrauma, and that different astroglial responses take place in distinct brain regions."
"Apolipoprotein (APOE) is a major risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the E2, E3 and E4 isoforms differentially regulating the burden of AD-associated neuropathologies, such as amyloid &#x3b2; and tau. In AD, pathological tau is thought to spread along neuroanatomic connections following a prion-like mechanism. To provide insights into whether APOE isoforms differentially regulate the prion properties of tau and determine trans-synaptic transmission of tauopathy, we have generated human P301S mutant tau transgenic mice (PS19) that carry human APOE (APOE2, APOE3 or APOE4) or mouse Apoe allele. Mice received intrahippocamal injections of preformed aggregates of K18-tau at young ages, which were analyzed 5&#xa0;months post-inoculation. Compared to the parental PS19 mice with mouse Apoe alleles, PS19 mice expressing human APOE alleles generally responded to K18-tau seeding with more intense AT8 immunoreactive phosphorylated tau athology. APOE3 homozygous mice accumulated higher levels of AT8-reactive ptau and microgliosis relative to APOE2 or APOE4 homozygotes (E3&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;E4~2). PS19 mice that were heterozygous for APOE3 showed similar results, albeit to a lesser degree. In the timeframe of our investigation, we did not observe significant induction of argentophilic or MC1-reactive neurofibrillary tau tangle in PS19 mice homozygous for human APOE. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study in rodent models that provides neuropathological insights into the dose-dependent effect of APOE isoforms on phosphorylated&#xa0;tau pathology induced by recombinant tau prions."
"A central event in the pathogenesis of motor neuron disease (MND) is the loss of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), yet the mechanisms that lead to this event in MND remain to be fully elucidated. Maintenance of the NMJ relies upon neural agrin (n-agrin) which, when released from the nerve terminal, activates the postsynaptic Muscle Specific Kinase (MuSK) signaling complex to stabilize clusters of acetylcholine receptors. Here, we report that muscle from MND patients has an increased proportion of slow fibers and muscle fibers with smaller diameter. Muscle cells cultured from MND biopsies failed to form large clusters of acetylcholine receptors in response to either non-MND human motor axons or n-agrin. Furthermore, levels of expression of MuSK, and MuSK-complex components: LRP4, Caveolin-3, and Dok7 differed between muscle cells cultured from MND patients compared to those from non-MND controls. To our knowledge, this is the first time a fault in the n-agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling pathway has been identified in muscle from MND patients. Our results highlight the n-agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target to prolong muscle function in MND."
"Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by a particularly invasive phenotype, supported by oncogenic signals from the fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/ FGF receptor (FGFR) network. However, a possible role of FGFR4 remained elusive so far. Several transcriptomic glioma datasets were analyzed. An extended panel of primary surgical specimen-derived and immortalized GBM (stem)cell models and original tumor tissues were screened for FGFR4 expression. GBM models engineered for wild-type and dominant-negative FGFR4 overexpression were investigated regarding aggressiveness and xenograft formation. Gene set enrichment analyses of FGFR4-modulated GBM models were compared to patient-derived datasets. Despite widely absent in adult brain, FGFR4 mRNA was distinctly expressed in embryonic neural stem cells and significantly upregulated in glioblastoma. Pronounced FGFR4 overexpression defined a distinct GBM patient subgroup with dismal prognosis. Expression levels of FGFR4 and its specific ligands FGF19/FGF23 correlated both in vitro and in vivo and were progressively upregulated in the vast majority of recurrent tumors. Based on overexpression/blockade experiments in respective GBM models, a central pro-oncogenic function of FGFR4 concerning viability, adhesion, migration, and clonogenicity was identified. Expression of dominant-negative FGFR4 resulted in diminished (subcutaneous) or blocked (orthotopic) GBM xenograft formation in the mouse and reduced invasiveness in zebrafish xenotransplantation models. In vitro and in vivo data consistently revealed distinct FGFR4 and integrin/extracellular matrix interactions. Accordingly, FGFR4 blockade profoundly sensitized FGFR4-overexpressing GBM models towards integrin/focal adhesion kinase inhibitors. Collectively, FGFR4 overexpression contributes to the malignant phenotype of a highly aggressive GBM subgroup and is associated with integrin-related therapeutic vulnerabilities."
"Pathologists can label pathologies differently, making it challenging to yield consistent assessments in the absence of one ground truth. To address this problem, we present a deep learning (DL) approach that draws on a cohort of experts, weighs each contribution, and is robust to noisy labels. We collected 100,495 annotations on 20,099 candidate amyloid beta neuropathologies (cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and cored and diffuse plaques) from three institutions, independently annotated by five experts. DL methods trained on a consensus-of-two strategy yielded 12.6-26% improvements by area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) when compared to those that learned individualized annotations. This strategy surpassed individual-expert models, even when unfairly assessed on benchmarks favoring them. Moreover, ensembling over individual models was robust to hidden random annotators. In blind prospective tests of 52,555 subsequent expert-annotated images, the models labeled pathologies like their human counterparts (consensus model AUPRC&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.74 cored; 0.69 CAA). This study demonstrates a means to combine multiple ground truths into a common-ground DL model that yields consistent diagnoses informed by multiple and potentially variable expert opinions."
"Damage to long axons in white matter tracts is a major pathology in closed head traumatic brain injury (TBI). Acute TBI treatments are needed that protect against axon damage and promote recovery of axon function to prevent long term symptoms and neurodegeneration. Our prior characterization of axon damage and demyelination after TBI led us to examine repurposing of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), an FDA-approved inhibitor of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels. 4-AP is currently indicated to provide symptomatic relief for patients with chronic stage multiple sclerosis, which involves axon damage and demyelination. We tested clinically relevant dosage of 4-AP as an acute treatment for experimental TBI and found multiple benefits in corpus callosum axons. This randomized, controlled pre-clinical study focused on the first week after TBI, when axons are particularly vulnerable. 4-AP treatment initiated one day post-injury dramatically reduced axon damage detected by intra-axonal fluorescence accumulations in Thy1-YFP mice of both sexes. Detailed electron microscopy in C57BL/6 mice showed that 4-AP reduced pathological features of mitochondrial swelling, cytoskeletal disruption, and demyelination at 7&#xa0;days post-injury. Furthermore, 4-AP improved the molecular organization of axon nodal regions by restoring disrupted paranode domains and reducing Kv1.2 channel dispersion. 4-AP treatment did not resolve deficits in action potential conduction across the corpus callosum, based on ex vivo electrophysiological recordings at 7&#xa0;days post-TBI. Thus, this first study of 4-AP effects on axon damage in the acute period demonstrates a significant decrease in multiple pathological hallmarks of axon damage after experimental TBI."
"DNA methylation of cytosines in CpG sites throughout the genome is an epigenetic mark contributing to gene expression regulation. DNA methylation patterns are specific to tissue type, conserved throughout life and reflect changes during tumorigenesis. DNA methylation recently emerged as a diagnostic tool to classify tumors based on a combination of preserved developmental and mutation induced signatures. In addition to the tumor classification, DNA methylation data can also be used to evaluate copy number variation, assess promoter methylation status of specific genes, such as MGMT or MLH1, and deconvolute the tumor microenvironment, assessing the tumor immune infiltrate as a potential biomarker for immunotherapy. Here we review the role for DNA methylation in tumor diagnosis."
"NF2 alteration is the most commonly-found genetic abnormality in meningiomas and is known to initiate events for aggressive-type meningiomas. Whereas the prognosis of meningiomas differs depending on their epigenomic/transcriptomic profile, the effect of NF2 alteration on the prognosis of benign meningiomas is not fully elucidated. This study aimed to probe the importance of NF2 alteration in prognosis of WHO grade I meningiomas. A long-term retrospective follow-up (5.3&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.5&#xa0;years) study involving 281 consecutive WHO grade I meningioma patients was performed. We assessed tumour recurrence in correlation with extent of resection (EOR), histopathological findings, tumour location, and NF2 alteration. ""NF2 meningioma"" was defined as meningiomas with presence of NF2 mutation and/or 22q loss. Overall, NF2 meningioma per se was not a predictor of prognosis in the whole cohort; however, it was a predictor of recurrence in supratentorial meningiomas, together with EOR and Ki-67. In a striking contrast, NF2 meningioma showed a better prognosis than non-NF2 meningioma in infratentorial lesion. Supratentorial NF2 meningiomas had higher Ki-67 and forkhead box protein M1 expression than those of others, possibly explaining the worse prognosis in this subtype. The combination of NF2 alteration, high Ki-67 and supratentorial location defines subgroup with the worst prognosis among WHO grade I meningiomas. Clinical connotation of NF2 alteration in terms of prognosis of WHO grade I meningioma differs in an opposite way between supratentorial and infratentorial tumors. Integrated anatomical, histopathological, and genomic classifications will provide the best follow-up schedule and proactive measures."
"Prenatal alcohol exposure is a major cause of neurobehavioral disabilities. MRI studies in humans have shown that alcohol is associated with white matter microstructural anomalies but these studies focused on myelin abnormalities only after birth. Only one of these studies evaluated oligodendrocyte lineage, but only for a short period during human foetal life. As data are lacking in humans and alcohol is known to impair oligodendrocyte differentiation in rodents, the present study aimed to compare by immunohistochemistry the oligodendrocyte precursor cells expressing PDGFR-&#x3b1; and immature premyelinating/mature oligodendrocytes expressing Olig2 in the ganglionic eminences and the frontal cortex of 14 human foetuses exposed to alcohol from 15 to 37&#xa0;weeks' gestation with age-matched controls. The human brains used in this study were obtained at the time of foetal autopsies for medical termination of pregnancy, in utero or post-natal early death. Before birth, PDGFR-&#x3b1; expression was strongly increased in the ganglionic eminences and the cortex of all foetuses exposed to alcohol except at the earliest stage. No massive generation of Olig2 immunoreactive cells was identified in the ganglionic eminences until the end of pregnancy and the density of Olig2-positive cells within the cortex was consistently lower in foetuses exposed to alcohol than in controls. These antenatal data from humans provides further evidence of major oligodendrocyte lineage impairment at specific and key stages of brain development upon prenatal alcohol exposure including defective or delayed generation and maturation of oligodendrocyte precursors."
"The majority of diffuse midline gliomas, H3 K27-altered (DMG-H3 K27-a), are infiltrating pediatric brain tumors that arise in the pons with no effective treatment. To understand how clonal evolution contributes to the tumor's invasive spread, we performed exome sequencing and SNP array profiling on 49 multi-region autopsy samples from 11 patients with pontine DMG-H3 K27-a enrolled in a phase I clinical trial of PDGFR inhibitor crenolanib. For each patient, a phylogenetic tree was constructed by testing multiple possible clonal evolution models to select the one consistent with somatic mutations and copy number variations across all tumor regions. The tree was then used to deconvolute subclonal composition and prevalence at each tumor region to study convergent evolution and invasion patterns. Somatic variants in the PI3K pathway, a late event, are enriched in our cohort, affecting 70% of patients. Convergent evolution of PI3K at distinct phylogenetic branches was detected in 40% of the patients. 24 (~&#x2009;50%) of tumor regions were occupied by subclones of mixed lineages with varying molecular ages, indicating multiple waves of invasion across the pons and extrapontine. Subclones harboring a PDGFRA amplicon, including one that amplified a PDGRFA<sup>Y849C</sup> mutant allele, were detected in four patients; their presence in extrapontine tumor and normal brain samples imply their involvement in extrapontine invasion. Our study expands the current knowledge on tumor invasion patterns in DMG-H3 K27-a, which may inform the design of future clinical trials."
"Recently, inspired by the similar clinical and pathological features shared with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), abnormal expansion of CGG repeats in the 5' untranslated region has been found in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID), oculopharyngeal myopathy with leukoencephalopathy (OPML), and oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDMs). Although the upstream open reading frame has not been elucidated in OPML and OPDMs, polyglycine (polyG) translated by expanded CGG repeats is reported to be as a primary pathogenesis in FXTAS and NIID. Collectively, these findings indicate a new disease entity, the polyG diseases. In this review, we state the common clinical manifestations, pathological features, mechanisms, and potential therapies in these diseases, and provide preliminary opinions about future research in polyG diseases."
"The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) has defined four vascular lesions in the central nervous system (CNS): arteriovenous malformations, cavernous angiomas (also known as cerebral cavernous malformations), venous malformations, and telangiectasias. From a retrospective central radiological and histopathological review of 202 CNS vascular lesions, we identified three cases of unclassified vascular lesions. Interestingly, they shared the same radiological and histopathological features evoking the cavernous subtype of angioleiomyomas described in the soft tissue. We grouped them together with four additional similar cases from our clinicopathological network and performed combined molecular analyses. In addition, cases were compared with a cohort of 5 soft tissue angioleiomyomas. Three out 6 CNS lesions presented the same p.Gly41Cys GJA4 mutation recently reported in hepatic hemangiomas and cutaneous venous malformations and found in 4/5 soft tissue angioleiomyomas of our cohort with available data. Most DNA methylation profiles were not classifiable using the CNS brain tumor (version 12.5), and sarcoma (version 12.2) classifiers. However, using unsupervised t-SNE analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis, 5 of the 6 lesions grouped together and formed a distinct epigenetic group, separated from the clusters of soft tissue angioleiomyomas, other vascular tumors, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors and meningiomas. Our extensive literature review identified several cases similar to these lesions, with a wide variety of denominations. Based on radiological and histomolecular findings, we suggest the new terminology of ""dural angioleiomyomas"" (DALM) to designate these lesions characterized by a distinct DNA methylation pattern and frequent GJA4 mutations."
"Frontotemporal dementia is characterized by progressive atrophy of frontal and/or temporal cortices at an early age of onset. The disorder shows considerable clinical, pathological, and genetic heterogeneity. Here we investigated the proteomic signatures of frontal and temporal cortex from brains with frontotemporal dementia due to GRN and MAPT mutations to identify the key cell types and molecular pathways in their pathophysiology. We compared patients with mutations in the GRN gene (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;9) or with mutations in the MAPT gene (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;13) with non-demented controls (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11). Using quantitative proteomic analysis on laser-dissected tissues we identified brain region-specific protein signatures for both genetic subtypes. Using published single cell RNA expression data resources we deduced the involvement of major brain cell types in driving these different protein signatures. Subsequent gene ontology analysis identified distinct genetic subtype- and cell type-specific biological processes. For the GRN subtype, we observed a distinct role for immune processes related to endothelial cells and for mitochondrial dysregulation in neurons. For the MAPT subtype, we observed distinct involvement of dysregulated RNA processing, oligodendrocyte dysfunction, and axonal impairments. Comparison with an in-house protein signature of Alzheimer's disease brains indicated that the observed alterations in RNA processing and oligodendrocyte function are distinct for the frontotemporal dementia MAPT subtype. Taken together, our results indicate the involvement of different brain cell types and biological mechanisms in genetic subtypes of frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, we demonstrate that comparison of proteomic profiles of different disease entities can separate general neurodegenerative processes from disease-specific pathways, which may aid the development of disease subtype-specific treatment strategies."
"Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is the most prevalent idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) affecting older adults. The pathogenic hallmark of IBM is chronic inflammation of skeletal muscle. At present, we do not classify IBM into different sub-entities, with the exception perhaps being the presence or absence of the anti-cN-1A-antibody. In contrast to other IIM, IBM is characterized by a chronic and progressive disease course. Here, we discuss the pathophysiological framework of IBM and highlight the seemingly prototypical situations where IBM occurs in the context of other diseases. In this context, understanding common immune pathways might provide insight into the pathogenesis of IBM. Indeed, IBM is associated with a distinct set of conditions, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C-two conditions associated with premature immune cell exhaustion. Further, the pathomorphology of IBM is reminiscent of other muscle diseases, notably HIV-associated myositis or granulomatous myositis. Distinct immune pathways are likely to drive these commonalities and senescence of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment is discussed as a possible mechanism of pathogenesis. Future effort directed at understanding the co-occurrence of IBM and associated diseases could prove valuable to better understand the enigmatic IBM pathophysiology."
"Thalamic volume is associated with clinical disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) and is vulnerable to secondary neurodegeneration due to its extensive connectivity throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Using a model of autoimmune demyelination that exhibits CNS-infiltrating immune cells in both spinal cord white matter and optic nerve, we sought to evaluate neurodegenerative changes due to lesions affecting the spino- and retino-thalamic pathways. We found comparable axonal loss in spinal cord white matter and optic nerve during the acute phase of disease consistent with synaptic loss, but not neuronal cell body loss in the thalamic nuclei that receive input from these discrete pathways. Loss of spinal cord neurons or retinal ganglion cells retrograde to their respective axons was not observed until the chronic phase of disease, where optical coherence tomography (OCT) documented reduced inner retinal thickness. In patients with relapsing-remitting MS without a history of optic neuritis, OCT measures of inner retinal volume correlated with retino-thalamic (lateral geniculate nucleus) and spino-thalamic (ventral posterior nucleus) volume as well as neuroperformance measures. These data suggest retinal imaging may serve as an important noninvasive predictor of neurodegeneration in MS."
"Desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma (DIA) is rare, cystic and solid tumor of infants usually found in superficial cerebral hemispheres. Although DIA is usually benign, uncommon cases bearing malignant histological and aggressive clinical features have been described in the literature. We report a newborn patient who was diagnosed with a DIA and died postresection. Pathologic examination revealed that the main part of the tumor had benign features, but the internal region showed areas with a more aggressive appearance, with higher-proliferative cells, anaplastic GFAP positive cells with cellular polymorphism, necrosis foci, vascular hyperplasia with endothelial proliferation and microtrombosis. Genetic study, performed in both regions of the tumor, showed a BRAF V600E mutation and a homozygous deletion in PTEN, without changes in other relevant genes like EGFR, CDKN2A, TP53, NFKBIA, CDK4, MDM2 and PDGFRA. Although PTEN homozygous deletions are described in gliomas, the present case constitutes the first report of a PTEN mutation in a DIA, and this genetic feature may be related to the malignant behavior of a usually benign tumor. These genetic findings may point at the need of further and deeper genetic characterization of DIAs, in order to better understand the biology of this tumor and to obtain new prognostic approaches, a better clinical management and targeted therapies, especially in malignant cases of DIA."
"Tau is a predominantly neuronal, soluble and natively unfolded protein that can bind and stabilize microtubules in the central nervous system. Tau has been extensively studied over several decades, especially in the context of neurodegenerative diseases where it can aberrantly aggregate to form a spectrum of pathological inclusions. The presence of tau inclusions in the form of neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads and dystrophic neurites within senile plaques are essential and defining features of Alzheimer's disease. The current dogma favors the notion that tau is predominantly an axonal protein, and that in Alzheimer's disease there is a redistribution of tau towards the neuronal soma that is associated with the formation of pathological inclusions such as neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads. Using novel as well as previously established highly specific tau antibodies, we demonstrate that contrary to this overwhelmingly accepted fact, as asserted in numerous articles and reviews, in adult human brain, tau is more abundant in cortical gray matter that is enriched in neuronal soma and dendrites compared to white matter that is predominantly rich in neuronal axons. Additionally, in Alzheimer's disease tau pathology is significantly more abundant in the brain cortical gray matter of affected brain regions compared to the adjacent white matter regions. These findings have important implications for the biological function of tau as well as the mechanisms involved in the progressive spread of tau associated with the insidious nature of Alzheimer's disease."
"Aberrant cortisol and activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) play an essential role in age-related progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the GR pathways required for influencing the pathobiology of AD dementia remain unknown. To address this, we studied an early phase of AD-like progression in the well-established APP/PS1 mouse model combined with targeted mutations in the BDNF-dependent GR phosphorylation sites (serines 134/267) using molecular, behavioral and neuroimaging approaches. We found that disrupting GR phosphorylation (S134A/S267A) in mice exacerbated the deleterious effects of the APP/PS1 genotype on mortality, neuroplasticity and cognition, without affecting either amyloid-&#x3b2; deposition or vascular pathology. The dynamics, maturation and retention of task-induced new dendritic spines of cortical excitatory neurons required GR phosphorylation at the BDNF-dependent sites that amyloid-&#x3b2; compromised. Parallel studies in postmortem human prefrontal cortex revealed AD subjects had downregulated BDNF signaling and concomitant upregulated cortisol pathway activation, which correlated with cognitive decline. These results provide key evidence that the loss of neurotrophin-mediated GR phosphorylation pathway promotes the detrimental effects of the brain cortisol response that contributes to the onset and/or progression of AD dementia. These findings have important translational implications as they provide a novel approach to treating AD dementia by identifying drugs that increase GR phosphorylation selectively at the neurotrophic sites to improve memory and cognition."
"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers play an important role in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) which is characterized by amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) amyloidosis. Here, we used two App knock-in mouse models, App<sup>NL-F/NL-F</sup> and App<sup>NL-G-F/NL-G-F</sup>, exhibiting AD-like A&#x3b2; pathology to analyze how the brain pathologies translate to CSF proteomes by label-free mass spectrometry (MS). This identified several extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins as significantly altered in App knock-in mice. Next, we compared mouse CSF proteomes with previously reported human CSF MS results acquired from patients across the AD spectrum. Intriguingly, the ECM protein decorin was similarly and significantly increased in both App<sup>NL-F/NL-F</sup> and App<sup>NL-G-F/NL-G-F</sup> mice, strikingly already at three months of age in the App<sup>NL-F/NL-F</sup> mice and preclinical AD subjects having abnormal CSF-A&#x3b2;42 but normal cognition. Notably, in this group of subjects, CSF-decorin levels positively correlated with CSF-A&#x3b2;42 levels indicating that the change in CSF-decorin is associated with early A&#x3b2; amyloidosis. Importantly, receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that CSF-decorin can predict a specific AD subtype having innate immune activation and potential choroid plexus dysfunction in the brain. Consistently, in App<sup>NL-F/NL-F</sup> mice, increased CSF-decorin correlated with both A&#x3b2; plaque load and with decorin levels in choroid plexus. In addition, a low concentration of human A&#x3b2;42 induces decorin secretion from mouse primary neurons. Interestingly, we finally identify decorin to activate neuronal autophagy through enhancing lysosomal function. Altogether, the increased CSF-decorin levels occurring at an early stage of A&#x3b2; amyloidosis in the brain may reflect pathological changes in choroid plexus, present in a subtype of AD subjects."
"CIC-rearranged sarcomas are newly defined undifferentiated soft tissue tumors with CIC-associated fusions, and dismal prognosis. CIC fusions activate PEA3 family genes, ETV1/4/5, leading to tumorigenesis and progression. We report two high-grade CNS sarcomas of unclear histological diagnosis and one disseminated tumor of unknown origin with novel fusions and similar gene-expression/methylation patterns without CIC rearrangement. All three patients were infants with aggressive diseases, and two experienced rapid disease deterioration and death. Whole-transcriptome sequencing identified an ATXN1-NUTM2A fusion in the two CNS tumors and an ATXN1L-NUTM2A fusion in case 3. ETV1/4/5 and WT1 overexpression were observed in all three cases. Methylation analyses predicted CIC-rearranged sarcoma for all cases. Retrospective IHC staining on case 2 demonstrated ETV4 and WT1 overexpression. ATXN1 and ATXN1L interact with CIC forming a transcription repressor complex. We propose that ATXN1/ATXN1L-associated fusions disrupt their interaction with CIC and decrease the transcription repressor complex, leading to downstream PEA3 family gene overexpression. These three cases with novel ATXN1/ATXN1L-associated fusions and features of CIC-rearranged sarcomas may further expand the scope of ""CIC-rearranged"" sarcomas to include non-CIC rearrangements. Additional cases are needed to demonstrate if ATXN1/ATXN1L-NUTM2A fusions are associated with younger age and more aggressive diseases."
"Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked, neuromuscular neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. The disease is characterized by a selective decrease in fast-muscle power (e.g., tongue pressure, grip strength) accompanied by a selective loss of fast-twitch muscle fibers. However, the relationship between neuromuscular junction (NMJ) pathology and fast-twitch motor unit vulnerability has yet to be explored. In this study, we used a cross-model comparison of two mouse models of SBMA to evaluate neuromuscular junction pathology, glycolytic-to-oxidative fiber-type switching, and cytoskeletal alterations in pre- and postsynaptic termini of tibialis anterior (TA), gastrocnemius, and soleus hindlimb muscles. We observed significantly increased NMJ and myofiber pathology in fast-twitch, glycolytic motor units of the TA and gastrocnemius compared to slow-twitch, oxidative motor units of the soleus, as seen by decreased pre- and post-synaptic membrane area, decreased pre- and post-synaptic membrane colocalization, increased acetylcholine receptor compactness, a decrease in endplate area and complexity, and deficits in neurofilament heavy chain. Our data also show evidence for metabolic dysregulation and myofiber atrophy that correlate with severity of NMJ pathology. We propose a model in which the dynamic communicative relationship between the motor neuron and muscle, along with the developmental subtype of the muscle, promotes motor unit subtype specific vulnerability, metabolic alterations, and NMJ pathology."
"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP) is a neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting the frontal and/or temporal cortices. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that the cerebellum contributes to biochemical, cognitive, and behavioral changes in FTLD-TDP. To evaluate cerebellar TDP-43 expression and function in FTLD-TDP, we analyzed TDP-43 protein levels and the splicing of a TDP-43 target, STMN2, in the cerebellum of 95 FTLD-TDP cases and 25 non-neurological disease controls. Soluble TDP-43 was decreased in the cerebellum of FTLD-TDP cases but a concomitant increase in insoluble TDP-43 was not seen. Truncated STMN2 transcripts, an indicator of TDP-43 dysfunction, were elevated in the cerebellum of FTLD-TDP cases and inversely associated with TDP-43 levels. Additionally, lower cerebellar TDP-43 associated with a younger age at disease onset. We provide evidence of TDP-43 loss of function in the cerebellum in FTLD-TDP, supporting further investigation into this understudied brain region."
"Corpora amylacea (CA) and their murine analogs, periodic acid Schiff (PAS) granules, are age-related, carbohydrate-rich structures that serve as waste repositories for aggregated proteins, damaged cellular organelles, and other cellular debris. The structure, morphology, and suspected functions of CA in the brain imply disease relevance. Despite this, the link between CA and age-related neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), remains poorly defined. We performed a neuropathological analysis of mouse PAS granules and human CA and correlated these findings with AD progression. Increased PAS granule density was observed in symptomatic tau transgenic mice and APOE knock-in mice. Using a cohort of postmortem AD brain samples, we examined CA in cognitively normal and dementia patients across Braak stages with varying APOE status. We identified a Braak-stage dependent bimodal distribution of CA in the dentate gyrus, with CA accumulating and peaking by Braak stages II-III, then steadily declining with increasing tau burden. Refined analysis revealed an association of CA levels with both cognition and APOE status. Finally, tau was detected in whole CA present in human patient cerebrospinal fluid, highlighting CA-tau as a plausible prodromal AD biomarker. Our study connects hallmarks of the aging brain with the emergence of AD pathology and suggests that CA may act as a compensatory factor that becomes depleted with advancing tau burden."
"Axonal swellings (AS) are one of the neuropathological hallmark of axonal injury in several disorders from trauma to neurodegeneration. Current evidence proposes a role of perturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in AS formation, involving impaired axonal transport and focal distension of the axons. Mechanisms of AS formation, in particular moments following injury, however, remain unknown. Here we show that AS form independently from intra-axonal Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes, which are required primarily for the persistence of AS in time. We further show that the majority of axonal proteins undergoing de/phosphorylation immediately following injury belong to the cytoskeleton. This correlates with an increase in the distance of the actin/spectrin periodic rings and with microtubule tracks remodeling within AS. Observed cytoskeletal rearrangements support axonal transport without major interruptions. Our results demonstrate that the earliest axonal response to injury consists in physiological adaptations of axonal structure to preserve function rather than in immediate pathological events signaling axonal destruction."
"Multiple studies have recognized the involvement of the complement cascade during Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. However, the specific role of C5a-C5aR1 signaling in the progression of this neurodegenerative disease is still not clear. Furthermore, its potential as a therapeutic target to treat AD still remains to be elucidated. Canonically, generation of the anaphylatoxin C5a as the result of complement activation and interaction with its receptor C5aR1 triggers a potent inflammatory response. Previously, genetic ablation of C5aR1 in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease exerted a protective effect by preventing cognitive deficits. Here, using PMX205, a potent, specific C5aR1 antagonist, in the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease we show a striking reduction in dystrophic neurites in parallel with the reduced amyloid load, rescue of the excessive pre-synaptic loss associated with AD cognitive impairment and the polarization of microglial gene expression towards a DAM-like phenotype that are consistent with the neuroprotective effects seen. These data support the beneficial effect of a pharmacological inhibition of C5aR1 as a promising therapeutic approach to treat Alzheimer's disease. Supportive of the safety of this treatment is the recent FDA-approval of another other C5a receptor 1 antagonist, Avacopan, as a treatment for autoimmune inflammatory diseases."
"Axonal transport ensures long-range delivery of essential cargoes between proximal and distal compartments, and is needed for neuronal development, function, and survival. Deficits in axonal transport have been detected at pre-symptomatic stages in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> and TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), suggesting that impairments in this critical process are fundamental for disease pathogenesis. Strikingly, in ALS, fast motor neurons (FMNs) degenerate first whereas slow motor neurons (SMNs) are more resistant, and this is a currently unexplained phenomenon. The main aim of this investigation was to determine the effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on in vivo axonal transport in different &#x3b1;-motor neuron (MN) subtypes in wild-type (WT) and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. We report that despite displaying similar basal transport speeds, stimulation of wild-type MNs with BDNF enhances in vivo trafficking of signalling endosomes specifically in FMNs. This BDNF-mediated enhancement of transport was also observed in primary ventral horn neuronal cultures. However, FMNs display selective impairment of axonal transport in vivo in symptomatic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice, and are refractory to BDNF stimulation, a phenotype that was also observed in primary embryonic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> neurons. Furthermore, symptomatic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice display upregulation of the classical non-pro-survival truncated TrkB and p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors in muscles, sciatic nerves, and Schwann cells. Altogether, these data indicate that cell- and non-cell autonomous BDNF signalling is impaired in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> MNs, thus identifying a new key deficit in ALS."
"Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a fundamental property of cancer and a key underlying mechanism of tumorigenesis and malignant progression, and has been documented in a wide variety of cancers, including colorectal carcinoma with mutations in genes such as APC. Recent reports have demonstrated that CIN, driven in part by mutations in genes maintaining overall genomic stability, is found in subsets of adult-type diffusely infiltrating gliomas of all histologic and molecular grades, with resulting elevated overall copy number burden, chromothripsis, and poor clinical outcome. Still, relatively few studies have examined the effect of this process, due in part to the difficulty of routinely measuring CIN clinically. Herein, we review the underlying mechanisms of CIN, the relationship between chromosomal instability and malignancy, the prognostic significance and treatment potential in various cancers, systemic disease, and more specifically, in diffusely infiltrating glioma subtypes. While still in the early stages of discovery compared to other solid tumor types in which CIN is a known driver of malignancy, the presence of CIN as an early factor in gliomas may in part explain the ability of these tumors to develop resistance to standard therapy, while also providing a potential molecular target for future therapies."
"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Glioma stem like cells (GSC) represent the highest cellular hierarchy in GBM and have a determining role in tumor growth, recurrence and patient prognosis. However, a better definition of GSC subpopulations, especially at the surgical resection margin, is warranted for improved oncological treatment options. The present study interrogated cells expressing CD105 (CD105<sup>+</sup>) specifically within the tumor front and the pre-invasive niche as a potential GSC subpopulation. GBM primary cell lines were generated from patients (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;18) and CD105<sup>+</sup> cells were isolated and assessed for stem-like characteristics. In vitro, CD105<sup>+</sup> cells proliferated and enriched in serum-containing medium but not in serum-free conditions. CD105<sup>+</sup> cells were characterized by Nestin<sup>+</sup>, Vimentin<sup>+</sup> and SOX2<sup>-</sup>, clearly distinguishing them from SOX2<sup>+</sup> GCS. GBM CD105<sup>+</sup> cells differentiated into osteocytes and adipocytes but not chondrocytes. Exome sequencing revealed that GBM CD105<sup>+</sup> cells matched 83% of somatic mutations in the Cancer cell line encyclopedia, indicating a malignant phenotype and in vivo xenotransplantation assays verified their tumorigenic potential. Cytokine assays showed that immunosuppressive and protumorigenic cytokines such as IL6, IL8, CCL2, CXCL-1 were produced by CD105<sup>+</sup> cells. Finally, screening for 88 clinical drugs revealed that GBM CD105<sup>+</sup> cells are resistant to most chemotherapeutics except Doxorubicin, Idarubicin, Fludarabine and ABT-751. Our study provides a rationale for targeting tumoral CD105<sup>+</sup> cells in order to reshape the tumor microenvironment and block GBM progression."
"Biallelic inactivation of NF2 represents the primary or sole oncogenic driver event in the vast majority of schwannomas. We report on a four-year-old female who underwent subtotal resection of a right medullary intraparenchymal schwannoma. RNA sequencing revealed an in-frame fusion between exon 5 of YAP1 and exon 2 of MAML2. YAP1-MAML2 fusions have previously been reported in a variety of tumor types, but not schwannomas. Our report expands the spectrum of oncogenic YAP1 gene fusions an alternative to NF2 inactivation to include sporadic schwannoma, analogous to what has recently been described in NF2-wildtype pediatric meningiomas. Appropriate somatic and germline molecular testing should be undertaken in all young patients with solitary schwannoma and meningioma given the high prevalence of an underlying tumor predisposition syndrome. In such patients, the identification of a somatic non-NF2 driver alteration such as this newly described YAP1 fusion, can help ascertain the diagnosis of a sporadic schwannoma."
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with various neurological complications. Although the mechanism is not fully understood, several studies have shown that neuroinflammation occurs in the acute and post-acute phase. As these studies have predominantly been performed with isolates from 2020, it is unknown if there are differences among SARS-CoV-2 variants in their ability to cause neuroinflammation. Here, we compared the neuroinvasiveness, neurotropism and neurovirulence of the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain D614G, the Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron BA.1 (B.1.1.529) variants using in vitro and in vivo models. The Omicron BA.1 variant showed reduced neurotropism and neurovirulence compared to Delta and D614G in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cortical neurons co-cultured with astrocytes. Similar differences were obtained in Syrian hamsters inoculated with D614G, Delta and the Omicron BA.1 variant 5&#xa0;days post infection. Replication in the olfactory mucosa was observed in all hamsters, but most prominently in D614G inoculated hamsters. Furthermore, neuroinvasion into the CNS via the olfactory nerve was observed in D614G, but not Delta or Omicron BA.1 inoculated hamsters. Furthermore, neuroinvasion was associated with neuroinflammation in the olfactory bulb of hamsters inoculated with D614G. Altogether, our findings suggest differences in the neuroinvasive, neurotropic and neurovirulent potential between SARS-CoV-2 variants using in vitro hiPSC-derived neural cultures and in vivo in hamsters during the acute phase of the infection."
"A major obstacle to identifying improved treatments for pediatric low-grade brain tumors (gliomas) is the inability to reproducibly generate human xenografts. To surmount this barrier, we leveraged human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) engineering to generate low-grade gliomas (LGGs) harboring the two most common pediatric pilocytic astrocytoma-associated molecular alterations, NF1 loss and KIAA1549:BRAF fusion. Herein, we identified that hiPSC-derived neuroglial progenitor populations (neural progenitors, glial restricted progenitors and oligodendrocyte progenitors), but not terminally differentiated astrocytes, give rise to tumors retaining LGG histologic features for at least 6&#xa0;months in vivo. Additionally, we demonstrated that hiPSC-LGG xenograft formation&#xa0;requires the absence of CD4 T cell-mediated induction of astrocytic Cxcl10 expression. Genetic Cxcl10 ablation is both necessary and sufficient for human LGG xenograft development, which additionally enables the successful long-term growth of patient-derived pediatric LGGs in vivo. Lastly, MEK inhibitor (PD0325901) treatment increased hiPSC-LGG cell apoptosis and reduced proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, this study establishes a tractable experimental humanized platform to elucidate the pathogenesis of and potential therapeutic opportunities for childhood brain tumors."
"Ependymoma is the second most common malignant brain tumor in children. The etiology is largely unknown and germline DNA sequencing studies focusing on childhood ependymoma are limited. We therefore performed germline whole-genome sequencing on a population-based cohort of children diagnosed with ependymoma in Denmark over the past 20&#xa0;years (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;43). Single nucleotide and structural germline variants in 457 cancer related genes and 2986 highly evolutionarily constrained genes were assessed in 37 children with normal tissue available for sequencing. Molecular ependymoma classification was performed using DNA methylation profiling for 39 children with available tumor tissue. Pathogenic germline variants in known cancer predisposition genes were detected in 11% (4/37; NF2, LZTR1, NF1 &amp; TP53). However, DNA methylation profiling resulted in revision of the histopathological ependymoma diagnosis to non-ependymoma tumor types in 8% (3/39). This included the two children with pathogenic germline variants in TP53 and NF1 whose tumors were reclassified to a diffuse midline glioma and a rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor, respectively. Consequently, 50% (2/4) of children with pathogenic germline variants in fact had other tumor types. A meta-analysis combining our findings with pediatric pan-cancer germline sequencing studies showed an overall frequency of pathogenic germline variants of 3.4% (7/207) in children with ependymoma. In summary, less than 4% of childhood ependymoma is explained by genetic predisposition, virtually restricted to pathogenic variants in NF2 and NF1. For children with other cancer predisposition syndromes, diagnostic reconsideration is recommended for ependymomas without molecular classification. Additionally, LZTR1 is suggested as a novel putative ependymoma predisposition gene."
"Alzheimer&#xb4;s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia in industrialized countries, severely targets the hippocampal formation in humans and mouse models of this condition. The adult hippocampus hosts the continuous addition of new dentate granule cells (DGCs) in numerous mammalian species, including humans. Although the morphology and positioning of DGCs within the granule cell layer (GCL) match their developmental origin in rodents, a similar correlation has not been reported in humans to date. Our data reveal that DGCs located in inner portions of the human GCL show shorter and less complex dendrites than those found in outer portions of this layer, which are presumably generated developmentally. Moreover, in AD patients, DGCs show early morphological alterations that are further aggravated as the disease progresses. An aberrantly increased number of DGCs with several primary apical dendrites is the first morphological change detected in patients at Braak-Tau I/II stages. This alteration persists throughout AD progression and leads to generalized dendritic atrophy at late stages of the disease. Our data reveal the distinct vulnerability of several morphological characteristics of DGCs located in the inner and outer portions of the GCL to AD and support the notion that the malfunction of the hippocampus is related to cognitive impairments in patients with AD."
"&#x3b1;-Dystrobrevin (&#x3b1;-DB) is a major component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC). Knockout (KO) of &#x3b1;-DB in the brain is associated with astrocytic abnormalities and loss of neuronal GABA receptor clustering. Mutations in DAPC proteins are associated with altered dopamine signaling and cognitive and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. This study tested the hypothesis that motivation and associated underlying biological pathways are altered in the absence of &#x3b1;-DB expression. Male wildtype and &#x3b1;-DB KO mice were tested for measures of motivation, executive function and extinction in the rodent touchscreen apparatus. Subsequently, brain tissues were evaluated for mRNA and/or protein levels of dysbindin-1, dopamine transporter and receptor 1 and 2, mu opioid receptor 1 (mOR1) and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1). &#x3b1;-DB KO mice had significantly increased motivation for the appetitive reward, while measures of executive function and extinction were unaffected. No differences were observed between wildtype and KO animals on mRNA levels of dysbindin-1 or any of the dopamine markers. mRNA levels of mOR1were significantly decreased in the caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens of &#x3b1;-DB KO compared to WT animals, but protein levels were unaltered. However, CB1 protein levels were significantly increased in the prefrontal cortex and decreased in the nucleus accumbens of &#x3b1;-DB KO mice. Triple-labelling immunohistochemistry confirmed that changes in CB1 were not specific to astrocytes. These results highlight a novel role for &#x3b1;-DB in the regulation of appetitive motivation that may have implications for other behaviours that involve the dopaminergic and endocannabinoid systems."
"Cerebellar dysfunction is commonly observed following traumatic brain injury (TBI). While direct impact to the cerebellum by TBI is rare, cerebellar pathology may be caused by indirect injury via cortico-cerebellar pathways. To address the hypothesis that degeneration of Purkinje cells (PCs), which constitute the sole output from the cerebellum, is linked to long-range axonal injury and demyelination, we used the central fluid percussion injury (cFPI) model of widespread traumatic axonal injury in mice. Compared to controls, TBI resulted in early PC loss accompanied by alterations in the size of pinceau synapses and levels of non-phosphorylated neurofilament in PCs. A combination of vDISCO tissue clearing technique and immunohistochemistry for vesicular glutamate transporter type 2 show that diffuse TBI decreased mossy and climbing fiber synapses on PCs. At 2&#xa0;days post-injury, numerous axonal varicosities were found in the cerebellum supported by fractional anisotropy measurements using 9.4&#xa0;T MRI. The disruption and demyelination of the cortico-cerebellar circuits was associated with poor performance of brain-injured mice in the beam-walk test. Despite a lack of direct input from the injury site to the cerebellum, these findings argue for novel long-range mechanisms causing Purkinje cell injury that likely contribute to cerebellar dysfunction after TBI."
"Corticotroph macroadenomas are rare but difficult to manage intracranial neoplasms. Mutations in the two Cushing's disease mutational hotspots USP8 and USP48 are less frequent in corticotroph macroadenomas and invasive tumors. There is evidence that TP53 mutations are not as rare as previously thought in these tumors. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of TP53 mutations in corticotroph tumors, with emphasis on macroadenomas, and their possible association with clinical and tumor characteristics. To this end, the entire TP53 coding region was sequenced in 86 functional corticotroph tumors (61 USP8 wild type; 66 macroadenomas) and the clinical characteristics of patients with TP53 mutant tumors were compared with TP53/USP8 wild type and USP8 mutant tumors. We found pathogenic TP53 variants in 9 corticotroph tumors (all macroadenomas and USP8 wild type). TP53 mutant tumors represented 14% of all functional corticotroph macroadenomas and 24% of all invasive tumors, were significantly larger and invasive, and had higher Ki67 indices and Knosp grades compared to wild type tumors. Patients with TP53 mutant tumors had undergone more therapeutic interventions, including radiation and bilateral adrenalectomy. In conclusion, pathogenic TP53 variants are more frequent than expected, representing a relevant amount of functional corticotroph macroadenomas and invasive tumors. TP53 mutations associated with more aggressive tumor features and difficult to manage disease."
"Single cell RNA sequencing studies identified novel neurodegeneration-associated microglial (MGnD/DAM) subtypes activated around cerebral amyloid plaques. Micro-RNA (miR)-155 of the TREM2-APOE pathway was shown to be a key transcriptional regulator of MGnD microglial phenotype. Despite growing interest in studying manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the retina, a CNS organ accessible to noninvasive high-resolution imaging, to date MGnD microglia have not been studied in the AD retina. Here, we discovered the presence and increased populations of Clec7a<sup>+</sup> and Galectin-3<sup>+</sup> MGnD microglia in retinas of transgenic APP<sub>SWE</sub>/PS1<sub>L166P</sub> AD-model mice. Conditionally targeting MGnD microglia by miR-155 ablation via the tamoxifen-inducible Cre<sup>ERT2</sup> system in APP<sub>SWE</sub>/PS1<sub>L166P</sub> mice diminished retinal Clec7a<sup>+</sup> and Galectin-3<sup>+</sup> microglial populations while increasing homeostatic P2ry12<sup>+</sup> microglia. Retinal MGnD microglia were often adhering to microvessels; their depletion protected the inner blood-retina barrier and reduced vascular amyloidosis. Microglial miR-155 depletion further limits retinal inflammation. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed enhanced retinal PI3K-Akt signaling and predicted IL-8 and Spp1 decreases in mice with microglia-specific miR-155 knockout. Overall, this study identified MGnD microglia in APP<sub>SWE</sub>/PS1<sub>L166P</sub> mouse retina. Transcriptional regulation of these dysfunctional microglia mitigated retinal inflammation and vasculopathy. The protective effects of microglial miR-155 ablation should shed light on potential treatments for retinal inflammation and vascular damage during AD and other ocular diseases."
"The pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD) are &#x3b1;-synuclein (&#x3b1;SYN)-positive inclusions referred to as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, collectively referred to as Lewy-related pathology (LRP). LRP is thought to propagate in an ascending manner throughout the brain as the disease progresses. LRP is visible with histologic methods and is thought to represent a later stage of the disease process, while &#x3b1;SYN oligomers, which are not visible with routine histologic methods, are considered earlier. There is increasing evidence to suggest that &#x3b1;SYN oligomers may be more toxic than visible LRP. Detecting &#x3b1;SYN oligomers requires special techniques, and their distribution and association with clinical features are&#xa0;important research objectives. In this report, we describe the distribution of &#x3b1;SYN oligomers in multiple cortical and subcortical regions of PD using a proximity ligation assay (PLA). We observe widespread distribution of &#x3b1;SYN oligomers with PLA and more restricted distribution of LRP with &#x3b1;SYN immunohistochemistry. The distribution of &#x3b1;SYN oligomers differed from LRP in that &#x3b1;SYN oligomer burden was significantly greater in the neocortex, while LRP was greater in vulnerable subcortical regions, including the brainstem. We also found that cognitive impairment was associated with &#x3b1;SYN oligomers in the hippocampus. These results suggest that &#x3b1;SYN oligomers may be widely distributed in PD early in the disease process and that they may contribute to cognitive impairment in PD."
"Non-functioning pituitary tumours (NF-PitNETs) are common intracranial benign neoplasms that can exhibit aggressive behaviour by invading neighbouring structures and, in some cases, have multiple recurrences. Despite resulting in severe co-morbidities, no predictive biomarkers of recurrence have been identified for NF-PitNETs. In this study we have used high-throughput mass spectrometry-based analysis to examine the phosphorylation pattern of different subsets of NF-PitNETs. Based on histopathological, radiological, surgical and clinical features, we have grouped NF-PitNETs into non-invasive, invasive, and recurrent disease groups. Tumour recurrence was determined based on regular clinical and radiological data of patients for a mean follow-up of 10&#xa0;years (SD&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.4&#xa0;years). Phosphoproteomic analyses identified a unique phosphopeptide enrichment pattern which correlates with disease recurrence. Candidate phosphorylated proteins were validated in a large cohort of NF-PitNET patients by western blot and immunohistochemistry. We identified a cluster of 22 phosphopeptides upregulated in recurrent NF-PitNETs compared to non-invasive and invasive subgroups. We reveal significant phosphorylation of the &#x3b2;-catenin at Ser552 in recurrent and invasive NF-PitNETs, compared to non-invasive/non-recurrent NF-PitNET subgroup. Moreover, &#x3b2;-catenin pSer552 correlates with the recurrence free survival among 200 patients with NF-PitNET. Together, our results suggest that the phosphorylation status of &#x3b2;-catenin at Ser552 could act as potential biomarker of tumour recurrence in NF-PitNETs."
"Posterior fossa group A ependymomas (EPN_PFA) are characterized by a loss of H3 K27 trimethylation due to either EZHIP overexpression or H3 p.K27M mutation, similar to H3 K27-altered diffuse midline gliomas (DMG), but in reverse proportions. Very little data is available in the literature concerning H3 K27M-mutant EPN_PFA. Here, we retrospectively studied a series of nine pediatric tumors initially diagnosed as H3 K27M-mutant EPN_PFA to compare them to EZHIP-overexpressing EPN_PFA in terms of radiology, follow-up, histopathology, and molecular biology (including DNA-methylation profiling). Seven tumors clustered within EPN_PFA by DNA-methylation analysis and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Among the two remaining cases, one was reclassified as a DMG and the last was unclassified. H3 K27M-mutant EPN_PFA cases were significantly older than their counterparts with an EZHIP overexpression. Radiological and histopathological central review of our seven H3 K27M-mutant EPN_PFA cases found them to be similar to their counterparts with an EZHIP overexpression. Sequencing analyses revealed HIST1H3B (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2), HIST1H3C (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2), H3F3A (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1), and HIST1H3D (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1) K27M mutations (no sequencing analysis available for the last case which was immunopositive for H3K27M). Consequently, HIST1H3C/D mutations are more frequently observed in EPN_PFA than in classic pontine DMG, H3K27-mutant. Overall survival and event-free survival of EZHIP-overexpressing and H3 K27M-mutant EPN_PFA were similar. After surgery and radiation therapy, 5/7 patients were alive at the end of the follow-up. In summary, the diagnosis of EPN_PFA must include tumor location, growth pattern, Olig2 expression, and DNA-methylation profiling before it can be differentiated from DMG, H3 K27-altered."
"Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system that in many cases leads to progressive MS, a neurodegenerative disease. Progressive MS is untreatable and relentless, and its cause is unknown. Prior studies of MS have documented neuronal accumulation of phosphorylated tau protein, which characterizes another heterogeneous group of neurogenerative disorders, the tauopathies. Known causes of tauopathy are myriad, and include point mutations within the tau gene, amyloid beta accumulation, repeated head trauma, and viral infection. We and others have proposed that tau has essential features of a prion. It forms intracellular assemblies that can exit a cell, enter a secondary cell, and serve as templates for their own replication in a process termed ""seeding."" We have previously developed specialized ""biosensor"" cell systems to detect and quantify tau seeds in brain tissues. We hypothesized that progressive MS is a tauopathy, potentially triggered by inflammation. We tested for and detected tau seeding in frozen brain tissue of 6/8 subjects with multiple sclerosis. We then evaluated multiple brain regions from a single subject for whom we had detailed clinical history. We observed seeding outside of MS plaques that was enriched by immunopurification with two anti-tau antibodies (HJ8.5 and MD3.1). Immunohistochemistry with AT8 and MD3.1 confirmed prior reports of tau accumulation in MS. Although larger studies are required, our data suggest that progressive MS may be considered a secondary tauopathy."
"Pathogenic variants in the NDUFV1 gene, which codes for complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, have been associated with a variety of clinical phenotypes, including a progressive cavitating leukoencephalopathy. The neuropathology of NDUFV1-associated leukoencephalopathy is not well-described. We present a report of a 24-year-old female with two pathogenic variants in the NDUFV1 gene, together with antemortem skeletal muscle biopsy and postmortem neuropathologic examination. Autopsy neuropathology showed a cavitating leukoencephalopathy with extensive white matter involvement, regions of active demyelination, and sparing of the subcortical U-fibers. Muscle biopsy showed subtle but distinct histologic abnormalities by light microscopy, and ultrastructural analysis demonstrated mitochondrial abnormalities including abnormal subsarcolemmal mitochondrial accumulation, electron-dense inclusions, and enlarged mitochondria with abnormal cristae. Our report is the first comprehensive description of the neuropathology in a patient with compound heterozygous variants in the NDUFV1 gene and progressive cavitating leukoencephalopathy. This case is evidence of pathogenicity of one NDUFV1 variant (c.565&#xa0;T&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;C, p.S189P), which has not been previously described as pathogenic. These findings, in combination with the ultrastructural abnormalities in the mitochondria by electron microscopy, support the mitochondrial nature of the pathology. Together, this case highlights the link between mitochondrial abnormalities and demyelinating processes in the central nervous system (CNS)."
"Gliomas are the most common central nervous tumors in children and adolescents. However, spinal cord low-grade gliomas (sLGGs) are rare, with scarce information on tumor genomics and epigenomics. To define the molecular landscape of sLGGs, we integrated clinical data, histology, and multi-level genetic and epigenetic analyses on a consecutive cohort of 26 pediatric patients. Driver molecular alteration was found in 92% of patients (24/26). A novel variant of KIAA1549:BRAF fusion (ex10:ex9) was identified using RNA-seq in four cases. Importantly, only one-third of oncogenic drivers could be revealed using standard diagnostic methods, and two-thirds of pediatric patients with sLGGs required extensive molecular examination. The majority (23/24) of detected alterations were potentially druggable targets. Four patients in our cohort received targeted therapy with MEK or NTRK inhibitors. Three of those exhibited clinical improvement (two with trametinib, one with larotrectinib), and two patients achieved partial response. Methylation profiling was implemented to further refine the diagnosis and revealed intertumoral heterogeneity in sLGGs. Although 55% of tumors clustered with pilocytic astrocytoma, other rare entities were identified in this patient population. In particular, diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumors (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;3) and high-grade astrocytoma with piloid features (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1) and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1) were present. A proportion of tumors (14%) had no match with the current version of the classifier. Complex molecular genetic sLGGs characterization was invaluable to refine diagnosis, which has proven to be essential in such a rare tumor entity. Moreover, identifying a high proportion of drugable targets in sLGGs opened an opportunity for new treatment modalities."
"Amyloid beta (A&#x3b2;) deposits in the retina of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) eye may provide a useful diagnostic biomarker for AD. This study focused on the relationship of A&#x3b2; with macroglia and microglia, as these glial cells are hypothesized to play important roles in homeostasis and clearance of A&#x3b2; in the AD retina. Significantly higher A&#x3b2; load was found in AD compared to controls, and specifically in the mid-peripheral region. AD retina showed significantly less immunoreactivity against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and glutamine synthetase (GS) compared to control eyes. Immunoreactivity against ionized calcium binding adapter molecule-1 (IBA-1), a microglial marker, demonstrated a higher level of microgliosis in AD compared to control retina. Within AD retina, more IBA-1 immunoreactivity was present in the mid-peripheral retina, which contained more A&#x3b2; than the central AD retina. GFAP co-localized rarely with A&#x3b2;, while IBA-1 co-localized with A&#x3b2; in more layers of control than AD donor retina. These results suggest that dysfunction of the M&#xfc;ller and microglial cells may be key features of the AD retina."
"Chemical and pharmaceutical exposures have been associated with the development of Gulf War Illness (GWI), but how these factors interact with the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains an area of study that has received little attention thus far. We studied the effects of pyridostigmine bromide (an anti-nerve agent) and permethrin (a pesticide) exposure in a mouse model of repetitive mild TBI (r-mTBI), with 5 impacts over a 9-day period, followed by Gulf War (GW) toxicant exposure for 10&#xa0;days beginning 30&#xa0;days after the last head injury. We then assessed the chronic behavioral and pathological sequelae 5&#xa0;months after GW agent exposure. We observed that r-mTBI and GWI cumulatively affect the spatial memory of mice in the Barnes maze and result in a shift of search strategies employed by r-mTBI/GW exposed mice. GW exposure also produced anxiety-like behavior in sham animals, but r-mTBI produced disinhibition in both the vehicle and GW treated mice. Pathologically, GW exposure worsened r-mTBI dependent axonal degeneration and neuroinflammation, increased oligodendrocyte cell counts, and increased r-mTBI dependent phosphorylated tau, which was found to colocalize with oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum. These results suggest that GW exposures may worsen TBI-related deficits. Veterans with a history of both GW chemical exposures as well as TBI may be at higher risk for worse symptoms and outcomes. Subsequent exposure to various toxic substances can influence the chronic nature of mTBI and should be considered as an etiological factor influencing mTBI recovery."
"Prion diseases are neurodegenerative disorders with long asymptomatic incubation periods, followed by a rapid progression of cognitive and functional decline culminating in death. The complexity of intercellular interactions in the brain is challenging to unravel and the basis of disease pathobiology remains poorly understood. In this study, we employed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to produce an atlas of 147,536 single cell transcriptomes from cortex and hippocampus of mice infected with prions and showing clinical signs. We identified transcriptionally distinct populations and sub-populations of all the major brain cell-types. Disease-related transcription was highly specific to not only overarching cell-types, but also to sub-populations of glia and neurons. Most striking was an apparent decrease in relative frequency of astrocytes expressing genes that are required for brain homeostasis such as lipid synthesis, glutamate clearance, synaptic modulation and regulation of blood flow. Additionally, we described a spectrum of microglial activation states that suggest delineation of phagocytic and neuroinflammatory functions in different cell subsets. Differential responses of immature and mature neuron populations were also observed, alongside abnormal hippocampal neurogenesis. Our scRNAseq library provides a new layer of knowledge on single cell gene expression in prion disease, and is a basis for a more detailed understanding of cellular interplay that leads to neurodegeneration."
"The possible role of somatic copy number variations (CNVs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) aetiology has been controversial. Although cytogenetic studies suggested increased CNV loads in AD brains, a recent single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS) experiment, studying frontal cortex brain samples, found no such evidence. Here we readdressed this issue using low-coverage scWGS on pyramidal neurons dissected via both laser capture microdissection (LCM) and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) across five brain regions: entorhinal cortex, temporal cortex, hippocampal CA1, hippocampal CA3, and the cerebellum. Among reliably detected somatic CNVs identified in 1301 cells obtained from the brains of 13 AD patients and 7 healthy controls, deletions were more frequent compared to duplications. Interestingly, we observed slightly higher frequencies of CNV events in cells from AD compared to similar numbers of cells from controls (4.1% vs. 1.4%, or 0.9% vs. 0.7%, using different filtering approaches), although the differences were not statistically significant. On the technical aspects, we observed that LCM-isolated cells show higher within-cell read depth variation compared to cells isolated with FACS. To reduce within-cell read depth variation, we proposed a principal component analysis-based denoising approach that significantly improves signal-to-noise ratios. Lastly, we showed that LCM-isolated neurons in AD harbour slightly more read depth variability than neurons of controls, which might be related to the reported hyperploid profiles of some AD-affected neurons."
"Protein misfolding is a prominent pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have shown that the diversity of &#x3b2; sheet-rich protein deposits (such as amyloid &#x3b2; plaques and neurofibrillary tangles), present across different brain regions, might underlie different disease phenotypes and only certain types of aggregates might be associated with cognitive decline. Conformationally sensitive fluorescent amyloid probes have the ability to report different structures of protein aggregates by virtue of their shifting emission spectra. Here we defined the binding affinity of the fluorescent amyloid probes BSB and MCAAD to disease-relevant protein aggregates, and combined the two probes to examine formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded mouse and human brain samples. Coupled with quantitative spectral phasor analysis, the dual-probe staining approach revealed remarkable heterogeneity of protein aggregates across the samples. Distinct emission spectra were consistent with certain types of deposits present in the mouse and human brain sections. The sensitivity of this staining, imaging and analysis approach outperformed conventional immunohistochemistry with the detected spectral differences between the greater parenchyma of cognitively normal and AD cases indicating a subtle yet widespread proteopathy associated with disease. Our method offers more sensitive, objective, and quantitative examination of protein misfolding pathology using conventional tissue sections."
"Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder, with a prevalence of 1-2% world-wide and substantial health-&#xa0;and&#xa0;social care&#xa0;costs. The pathology is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, however&#xa0;the underlying cause still remains elusive. SZ has symptoms including delusions, hallucinations, confused thoughts, diminished emotional responses, social withdrawal and anhedonia. The onset of psychosis is usually in late adolescence or early adulthood. Multiple genome-wide association and whole exome sequencing studies have provided extraordinary insights into the genetic variants underlying familial as well as polygenic forms of the disease. Nonetheless, a major limitation in schizophrenia research remains the lack of clinically relevant animal models, which in turn hampers the development of novel effective therapies for the patients. The emergence of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology has allowed researchers to work with SZ patient-derived neuronal and glial cell types in vitro and to investigate the molecular basis of the disorder in a human neuronal context. In this review, we summarise findings from available studies using hiPSC-based neural models and discuss how these have provided new insights into molecular and cellular pathways of SZ. Further, we highlight different examples of how these models have shown alterations in neurogenesis, neuronal maturation, neuronal connectivity and synaptic impairment as well as mitochondrial dysfunction and dysregulation of miRNAs in SZ patient-derived cultures compared to controls. We discuss the pros and cons of these models and describe the potential of using such models for deciphering the contribution of specific human neural cell types to the development of the disease."
"Pneumococcal meningitis is associated with dysregulation of the coagulation cascade. Previously, we detected upregulation of cerebral plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2) mRNA expression during pneumococcal meningitis. Diverse functions have been ascribed to PAI-2, but its role remains unclear. We analyzed the function of SERPINB2 (coding for PAI-2) in patients with bacterial meningitis, in a well-established pneumococcal meningitis mouse model, using Serpinb2 knockout mice, and in vitro in wt and PAI-2-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). We measured PAI-2 in cerebrospinal fluid of patients, and performed functional, histopathological, protein and mRNA expression analyses in vivo and in vitro. We found a substantial increase of PAI-2 concentration in CSF of patients with pneumococcal meningitis, and up-regulation and increased release of PAI-2 in mice. PAI-2 deficiency was associated with increased mortality in murine pneumococcal meningitis and cerebral hemorrhages. Serpinb2<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited increased C5a levels, but decreased IL-10 levels in the brain during pneumococcal infection. Our in vitro experiments confirmed increased expression and release of PAI-2 by wt BMDM and decreased IL-10 liberation by PAI-2-deficient BMDM upon pneumococcal challenge. Our data show that PAI-2 is elevated during in pneumococcal meningitis in humans and mice. PAI-2 deficiency causes an inflammatory imbalance, resulting in increased brain pathology and mortality."
"We report the case of a 22-year-old woman presenting with an acute onset of dizziness, gait dysbalance and blurred vision. Magnetic resonance imaging included 3 Tesla and 7 Tesla imaging and revealed a T2-hyperintense, T1-hypointense, non-contrast-enhancing lesion strictly confined to the white matter affecting the right optic radiation. An extensive ophthalmologic examination yielded mild quadrantanopia but no signs of optic neuropathy. The lesion was biopsied. The neuropathological evaluation revealed a demyelinating lesion with marked tissue vacuolization and granular myelin disintegration accompanied by mild T cell infiltration and a notable absence of myelin uptake by macrophages. Oligodendrocytes were strikingly enlarged, displaying oncocytic characteristics and showed cytoplasmic accumulation of mitochondria, which had mildly abnormal morphology on electron microscopy. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was excluded. Harding's disease, a variant of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, was then suspected. However, neither PCR for relevant mutations nor whole exome sequencing yielded known pathogenetic mutations in the patient's genome. We present a pattern of demyelinating tissue injury of unknown etiology with an oncocytic change of oligodendrocytes and a lack of adequate phagocytic response by macrophages, which to the best of our knowledge, has not been described before."
"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an aggressive incurable brainstem tumor that targets young children. Complete resection is not possible, and chemotherapy and radiotherapy are currently only palliative. This study aimed to identify potential therapeutic agents using a computational pipeline to perform an in silico screen for novel drugs. We then tested the identified drugs against a panel of patient-derived DIPG cell lines. Using a systematic computational approach with publicly available databases of gene signature in DIPG patients and cancer cell lines treated with a library of clinically available drugs, we identified drug hits with the ability to reverse a DIPG gene signature to one that matches normal tissue background. The biological and molecular effects of drug treatment was analyzed by cell viability assay and RNA sequence. In vivo DIPG mouse model survival studies were also conducted. As a result, two of three identified drugs showed potency against the DIPG cell lines Triptolide and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) demonstrated significant inhibition of cell viability in DIPG cell lines. Guanosine rescued reduced cell viability induced by MMF. In vivo, MMF treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth in subcutaneous xenograft mice models. In conclusion, we identified clinically available drugs with the ability to reverse DIPG gene signatures and anti-DIPG activity in vitro and in vivo. This novel approach can repurpose drugs and significantly decrease the cost and time normally required in drug discovery."
"Several neurodegenerative pathologies can clinically mimic Parkinson's disease, including neurodegenerative diseases with glial pathology. However, the glial aggregates are typically composed of known pathogenic proteins and are associated with prominent neuronal loss in the substantia nigra. Here we present an unusual case of a 91-year-old man with a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, but whose autopsy findings showed a ubiquitin-positive astrogliopathy without significant neuronal loss in the substantia nigra. These glial aggregates affected the basal ganglia, cortex, and cerebellum, and were negative for tau, alpha-synuclein, TDP-43, FUS, and p62. This case is a rare example of an unknown glial neurodegenerative pathology mimicking Parkinson's disease without significant loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons."
"Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by phenotypic changes and hallmark proteopathies. Quantifying these in archival human brain tissues remains indispensable for validating animal models and understanding disease mechanisms. We present a framework for nanometer-scale, spatial proteomics with multiplex ion beam imaging (MIBI) for capturing neuropathological features. MIBI facilitated simultaneous, quantitative imaging of 36 proteins on archival human hippocampus from individuals spanning cognitively normal to dementia. Customized analysis strategies identified cell types and proteopathies in the hippocampus across stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathologic change. We show microglia-pathologic tau interactions in hippocampal CA1 subfield in AD dementia. Data driven, sample independent creation of spatial proteomic regions identified persistent neurons in pathologic tau neighborhoods expressing mitochondrial protein MFN2, regardless of cognitive status, suggesting a survival advantage. Our study revealed unique insights from multiplexed imaging and data-driven approaches for neuropathologic analysis and serves broadly as a methodology for spatial proteomic analysis of archival human neuropathology. TEASER: Multiplex Ion beam Imaging enables deep spatial phenotyping of human neuropathology-associated cellular and disease features."
"Since the introduction of integrated histological and molecular diagnoses by the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumors of the Nervous System, an increasing number of molecular markers have been found to have prognostic significance in infiltrating gliomas, many of which have now become incorporated as diagnostic criteria in the 2021 WHO Classification. This has increased the applicability of targeted-next generation sequencing in the diagnostic work-up of neuropathology specimens and in addition, raises the question of whether targeted sequencing can, in practice, reliably replace older, more traditional diagnostic methods such as immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in-situ hybridization. Here, we demonstrate that the Oncomine Cancer Gene Mutation Panel v2 assay targeted-next generation sequencing panel for solid tumors is not only superior to IHC in detecting mutation in IDH1/2 and TP53 but can also predict 1p/19q co-deletion with high sensitivity and specificity relative to fluorescence in-situ hybridization by looking at average copy number of genes sequenced on 1p, 1q, 19p, and 19q. Along with detecting the same molecular data obtained from older methods, targeted-next generation sequencing with an RNA sequencing component provides additional information regarding the presence of RNA based alterations that have diagnostic significance and possible therapeutic implications. From this work, we advocate for expanded use of targeted-next generation sequencing over more traditional methods for the detection of important molecular alterations as a part of the standard diagnostic work up for CNS neoplasms."
"Lipid peroxidation is a process of oxidative degradation of cellular lipids that is increasingly recognized as an important factor in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. We were therefore interested in the manifestation of lipid peroxidation in synucleinopathies, a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the central pathology of &#x3b1;-synuclein aggregates, including Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease with Lewy bodies. We assessed lipid peroxidation products, lipid aldehydes, in the amygdala, a common disease-affected region in synucleinopathies, and in the visual cortex, a disease-unaffected region. We found that the levels of lipid aldehydes were significantly increased in the amygdala, but not in the visual cortex. We hypothesized that these increases are due to increases in the abundance of unsaturated lipids, since lipid aldehydes are formed from unsaturated lipids. We undertook a comprehensive analysis of membrane lipids using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and found that unsaturated phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and sphingomyelin were specifically elevated in the amygdala and correlated with increases in lipid aldehydes. Furthermore, unsaturated phosphatidylethanolamine levels were associated with soluble &#x3b1;-synuclein. Put together, these results suggest that manifestation of lipid peroxidation is prevalent in synucleinopathies and is likely to be due to increases in unsaturated membrane lipids. Our findings underscore the importance of lipid peroxidation in &#x3b1;-synuclein pathology and in membrane structure maintenance."
"Neuropathology and neuroimaging studies have identified several subtypes of Alzheimer's disease (AD): hippocampal sparing AD, typical AD, and limbic predominant AD. An unresolved question is whether hippocampal sparing AD cases can present with neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in association cortices while completely sparing the hippocampus. To address that question, we conducted a systematic review and performed original analyses on tau positron emission tomography (PET) data. We searched EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science databases until October 2022. We also implemented several methods for AD subtyping on tau PET to identify hippocampal sparing AD cases. Our findings show that seven out of the eight reviewed neuropathologic studies included cases at Braak stages IV or higher and therefore, could not identify hippocampal sparing cases with NFT completely sparing the hippocampus. In contrast, tau PET did identify AD participants with tracer retention in the association cortex while completely sparing the hippocampus. We conclude that tau PET can identify hippocampal sparing AD cases with NFT completely sparing the hippocampus. Based on the accumulating data, we suggest two possible pathways of tau spread: (1) a canonical pathway with early involvement of transentorhinal cortex and subsequent involvement of limbic regions and association cortices, and (2) a less common pathway that affects association cortices with limbic involvement observed at end stages of the disease or not at all."
"Rasmussen encephalitis (RE) is a rare childhood neurological disease characterized by progressive unilateral loss of function, hemispheric atrophy and drug-resistant epilepsy. Affected brain tissue shows signs of infiltrating cytotoxic T-cells, microglial activation, and neuronal death, implicating an inflammatory disease process. Recent studies have identified molecular correlates of inflammation in RE, but cell-type-specific mechanisms remain unclear. We used single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) to assess gene expression across multiple cell types in brain tissue resected from two children with RE. We found transcriptionally distinct microglial populations enriched in RE compared to two age-matched individuals with unaffected brain tissue and two individuals with Type I focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). Specifically, microglia in RE tissues demonstrated increased expression of genes associated with cytokine signaling, interferon-mediated pathways, and T-cell activation. We extended these findings using spatial proteomic analysis of tissue from four surgical resections to examine expression profiles of microglia within their pathological context. Microglia that were spatially aggregated into nodules had increased expression of dynamic immune regulatory markers (PD-L1, CD14, CD11c), T-cell activation markers (CD40, CD80) and were physically located near distinct CD4+&#x2009;and CD8+&#x2009;lymphocyte populations. These findings help elucidate the complex immune microenvironment of RE."
"Chromosome 3-linked frontotemporal dementia (FTD3) is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in CHMP2B, resulting in the production of a truncated toxic protein, CHMP2B<sup>Intron5</sup>. Loss-of-function mutations in spastin are the most common genetic cause of hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP). How these proteins might interact with each other to drive pathology remains to be explored. Here we found that spastin binds with greater affinity to CHMP2B<sup>Intron5</sup> than to CHMP2B<sup>WT</sup> and colocalizes with CHMP2B<sup>Intron5</sup> in p62-positive aggregates. In cultured cells expressing CHMP2B<sup>Intron5</sup>, spastin level in the cytoplasmic soluble fraction is decreased while insoluble spastin level is increased. These pathological features of spastin are validated in brain neurons of a mouse model of FTD3. Moreover, genetic knockdown of spastin enhances CHMP2B<sup>Intron5</sup> toxicity in a Drosophila model of FTD3, indicating the functional significance of their association. Thus, our study reveals that the enhanced association between mutant CHMP2B and spastin represents a novel potential pathological link between FTD3 and HSP."
"Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy for neurological disease has been successful in clinical settings and its potential has generated hope for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously described that ablating SNCA encoding for &#x3b1;-synuclein (&#x3b1;Syn) in a mouse model of AD was beneficial. Here, we sought to demonstrate whether transient reduction of &#x3b1;Syn expression using ASO<sup>SNCA</sup> could be therapeutic in a mouse model of AD. The efficacy of the ASO<sup>SNCA</sup> was measured via immunocytochemistry, RT-qPCR and western blotting. To assess spatial learning and memory, ASO<sup>SNCA</sup> or PBS-injected APP and non-transgenic (NTG) mice, and separate groups of SNCA-null mice, were tested on the Barnes circular maze. Hippocampal slice electrophysiology and transcriptomic profiling were used to explore synaptic function and differential gene expression between groups. Reduction of SNCA transcripts alleviated cognitive deficits in male transgenic animals, but surprisingly, not in females. To determine the functional cause of this differential effect, we assessed memory function in SNCA-null mice. Learning and memory were intact in male mice but impaired in female animals, revealing that the role of &#x3b1;Syn on cognitive function is sex-specific. Transcriptional analyses identified a differentially expressed gene network centered around EGR1, a central modulator of learning and memory, in the hippocampi of SNCA-null mice. Thus, these novel results demonstrate that the function of &#x3b1;Syn on memory differs between male and female brains."
"The long-lived Chilean rodent (Octodon degus) has been reported to show spontaneous age-dependent neuropathology and cognitive impairments similar to those observed in human AD. However, the handful of published papers on degus of differing genetic backgrounds yield inconsistent findings about sporadic AD-like pathological features, with notably differing results between lab in-bred degus versus outbred degus. This motivates more extensive characterization of spontaneously occurring AD-like pathology and behavior in degus. In the present study, we show AD-like neuropathological markers in the form of amyloid deposits and tau abnormalities in a cognitively impaired subset of aged outbred degus. Compared to the aged degus that show normal burrowing behavior, the age-matched degus with burrowing behavior deficits correlatively exhibit detectable human AD-like A&#x3b2; deposits and tau neuropathology, along with neuroinflammatory markers that include enhanced microglial activation and higher numbers of reactive astrocytes in the brain. This subset of cognitively impaired aged degus also exhibits cerebral amyloid angiopathy and tauopathy. We find robust neurodegenerative features in behaviorally deficient aged degus, including hippocampal neuronal loss, altered parvalbumin and perineuronal net staining in the cortex, and increased c-Fos neuronal activation in the cortex that is consistent with the neural circuit hyperactivity reported in human AD patients. By focusing on the subset of aged degus that show AD-like behavioral deficits and correlative neuropathology, our findings establish outbred degus as a natural model of sporadic AD and demonstrate the potential importance of wild-type outbred genetic backgrounds for AD pathogenesis."
"Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) are similar and even believed to be indistinguishable in terms of their myopathological features. To address the diagnostic gap, we evaluated the muscle biopsy samples for p62 expression by immunohistochemistry and compared the occurrence and the frequency of intranuclear inclusions among the individuals with OPDM (harboring CGG repeat expansion in LRP12 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;19), GIPC1 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;6), or NOTCH2NLC (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;7)), OPMD (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15), and other rimmed vacuolar myopathies. We found that myonuclei with p62-positive intra-nuclear inclusions (myo-INIs) were significantly more frequent in OPMD (11.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.1%, range 5.9-18.6%) than in OPDM and other rimmed vacuolar myopathies (RVMs) (0.9-1.5% on average, range 0.0-2.8%, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001). In contrast, INIs in non-muscle cells such as blood vessels, peripheral nerve bundles, and muscle spindles (non-muscle-INIs) were present in OPDM, but absent in OPMD. These results indicate that OPMD can be differentiated from OPDM and other RVMs by the frequent presence of myo-INIs; and in OPDM, the presence of non-muscle-INIs in muscle pathology should be a diagnostic hallmark."
"Wolfram Syndrome (WS) is a fatal human inherited disease with symptoms of diabetes, vision decreasing, and neurodegeneration caused by mutations in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein WFS1. WFS1 has been reported to play an important role in glucose metabolism. However, the role of WFS1 in axonal regeneration in the central nervous system has so far remained elusive. Herein, we established a model of the wfs1b globally deficient zebrafish line. wfs1b deficiency severely impeded the Mauthner-cell (M-cell) axon regeneration, which was partly dependent on the ER stress response. The administration of ER stress inhibitor 4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) promoted M-cell axon regeneration in wfs1b<sup>-/-</sup> zebrafish larvae, while the ER stress activator Tunicamycin (TM) inhibited M-cell axon regeneration in wfs1b<sup>+/+</sup> zebrafish larvae. Moreover, complementation of wfs1b at the single-cell level stimulated M-cell axon regeneration in the wfs1b<sup>-/-</sup> zebrafish larvae. Altogether, our results revealed that wfs1b promotes M-cell axon regeneration through the ER stress signal pathway and provide new evidence for a therapeutic target for WS and axon degeneration."
"Nemaline myopathy (NM) is one of the most common non-dystrophic genetic muscle disorders. NM is often associated with mutations in the NEB gene. Even though the exact NEB-NM pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear, histological analyses of patients' muscle biopsies often reveal unexplained accumulation of glycogen and abnormally shaped mitochondria. Hence, the aim of the present study was to define the exact molecular and cellular cascade of events that would lead to potential changes in muscle energetics in NEB-NM. For that, we applied a wide range of biophysical and cell biology assays on skeletal muscle fibres from NM patients as well as untargeted proteomics analyses on isolated myofibres from a muscle-specific nebulin-deficient mouse model. Unexpectedly, we found that the myosin stabilizing conformational state, known as super-relaxed state, was significantly impaired, inducing an increase in the energy (ATP) consumption of resting muscle fibres from NEB-NM patients when compared with controls or with other forms of genetic/rare, acquired NM. This destabilization of the myosin super-relaxed state had dynamic consequences as we observed a remodeling of the metabolic proteome in muscle fibres from nebulin-deficient mice. Altogether, our findings explain some of the hitherto obscure hallmarks of NM, including the appearance of abnormal energy proteins and suggest potential beneficial effects of drugs targeting myosin activity/conformations for NEB-NM."
"Interstitial fluid (ISF) from brain drains along the basement membranes of capillaries and arteries as Intramural Periarterial Drainage (IPAD); failure of IPAD results in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). In this study, we test the hypothesis that IPAD fails after subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). The rat SAH model was established using endovascular perforation method. Fluorescence dyes with various molecular weights were injected into cisterna magna of rats, and the pattern of IPAD after SAH was detected using immunofluorescence staining, two-photon fluorescent microscope, transmission electron microscope and magnetic resonance imaging tracking techniques. Our results showed that fluorescence dyes entered the brain along a periarterial compartment and were cleared from brain along the basement membranes of the capillaries, with different patterns based on individual molecular weights. After SAH, there was significant impairment in the IPAD system: marked expansion of perivascular spaces, and ISF clearance rate was significantly decreased, associated with the apoptosis of endothelial cells, activation of astrocytes, over-expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 and loss of collagen type IV. In conclusion, experimental SAH leads to a failure of IPAD, clinically significant for long term complications such as CAA, following SAH."
"Human middle temporal gyrus (MTG) is a vulnerable brain region in early Alzheimer's disease (AD), but little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this regional vulnerability. Here we utilize the 10&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;Visium platform to define the spatial transcriptomic profile in both AD and control (CT) MTG. We identify unique marker genes for cortical layers and the white matter, and layer-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in human AD compared to CT. Deconvolution of the Visium spots showcases the significant difference in particular cell types among cortical layers and the white matter. Gene co-expression analyses reveal eight gene modules, four of which have significantly altered co-expression patterns in the presence of AD pathology. The co-expression patterns of hub genes and enriched pathways in the presence of AD pathology indicate an important role of cell-cell-communications among microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons, which may contribute to the cellular and regional vulnerability in early AD. Using single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization, we validated the cell-type-specific expression of three novel DEGs (e.g., KIF5A, PAQR6, and SLC1A3) and eleven previously reported DEGs associated with AD pathology (i.e., amyloid beta plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles or neuropil threads) at the single cell level. Our results may contribute to the understanding of the complex architecture and neuronal and glial response to AD pathology of this vulnerable brain region."
"Regeneration of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) leverages on extensive exchange of factors released from motor axon terminals (MATs), muscle fibers and perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs), among which hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is a major pro-regenerative signal. To identify critical determinants of NMJ remodeling in response to injury, we performed temporal transcriptional profiling of NMJs from 2&#xa0;month-old mice during MAT degeneration/regeneration, and cross-referenced the differentially expressed genes with those elicited by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in SCs. We identified an enrichment in extracellular matrix (ECM) transcripts, including Connective Tissue Growth Factor (Ctgf), which is usually expressed during development. We discovered that Ctgf levels are increased in a Yes-associated protein (YAP)-dependent fashion in response to rapid, local H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signaling generated by stressed mitochondria in the injured sciatic nerve, a finding highlighting the importance of signals triggered by mechanical force to motor nerve repair. Through sequestration of Ctgf or inactivation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, we delayed the recovery of neuromuscular function by impairing SC migration and, in turn, axon-oriented re-growth. These data indicate that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and its downstream effector Ctgf are pro-regenerative factors that enable axonal growth, and reveal a striking ECM remodeling process during nerve regeneration upon local H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signaling. Our study identifies key transcriptomic changes at the regenerating NMJ, providing a rich source of pro-regenerative factors with potential for alleviating the consequences of peripheral nerve injuries."

## Retraction note 
  
The authors are retracting this article [ ]. Careful re-examination of the transgenic mice used in this study has indicated that they contain a transgenic sequence containing a 90CGG repeat, associated with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Apparently, a mixture of two constructs containing the G4C2 repeat and the CGG repeat sequence was injected in oocytes to generate transgenic mice. The presence of the CGG repeat can explain the neuropathology described in the mice used for this study. We are therefore unable to present this transgenic mouse as model for C9orf72 related amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

The authors are retracting this article. The article describes mice expressing wild-type human MATR3. However, since publication the authors have become aware that all of the lines of mice described express human MATR3 containing the F115C mutation. Transgenic mice expressing wild-type and mutant Matrin were created simultaneously in their laboratory and, at a crucial stage of generating the DNA for embryo injection, as confirmed by an investigation by the University of Florida, the DNA preparations were accidentally mislabelled. All of the founders created were mosaic, requiring extensive breeding to isolate stable lines. Mice mislabelled as expressing wild-type MATR3 were the first to produce lines that stably transmitted the transgene and thus were the first to be characterized. However, as lines of mice that were mislabelled as expressing the mutant (F115C) MATR3 were ultimately established, the data began to suggest that an error had been made. Sequence analysis of amplified tail DNA from mice descended from the lines reported in the article have revealed that they express the F115C variant. The data described are therefore an accurate description of the pathology of mice that express the F115C variant of MATR3, but not of mice expressing wild-type MATR3. The authors are preparing a new manuscript reporting data from both mice expressing the F115C variant of MATR3 and mice expressing wild-type MATR3.

"A cardinal feature of impaired skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism in mitochondrial myopathies is a limited ability to increase the extraction of O(2) from blood relative to the increase in O(2) delivery by the circulation during exercise. We investigated whether aerobic forearm exercise would result in an abnormal increase in venous effluent O(2) in patients with impaired skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation attributable to mitochondrial disease. We monitored the partial pressure of O(2) (PO(2)) in cubital venous blood at rest, during handgrip exercise, and during recovery in 13 patients with mitochondrial myopathy and exercise intolerance and in 13 healthy control and 11 patient control subjects. Resting and recovery venous effluent PO(2) were similar in all subjects, but during exercise venous PO(2) paradoxically rose in mitochondrial myopathy patients from 27.2 +/- 4.0mmHg to 38.2 +/- 13.3mmHg, whereas PO(2) fell from 27.2 +/- 4.2mmHg to 24.2 +/- 2.7mmHg in healthy subjects and from 27.4 +/- 9.5mmHg to 22.2 +/- 5.2mmHg in patient controls. The range of elevated venous PO(2) during forearm exercise in mitochondrial myopathy patients (32 to 82mmHg) correlated closely with the severity of oxidative impairment as assessed during cycle exercise. We conclude that measurement of venous PO(2) during aerobic forearm exercise provides an easily performed screening test that sensitively detects impaired O(2) use and accurately assesses the severity of oxidative impairment in patients with mitochondrial myopathy and exercise intolerance."
"We evaluated a kindred with X-linked mental retardation and epilepsy. Seven affected males with mild to moderate mental retardation developed seizures (primarily generalized, tonic-clonic, and atonic) that began on average at 6.8 months of age (range, 4 to 14 months). These patients did not have a history of infantile spasms. There were no dysmorphic features. Other than mental retardation, the neurological examination was unremarkable, with exception of 2 affected subjects who had mild generalized rigidity and ataxia. We identified tight linkage to a group of markers on Xp21.1-p11.4. A maximum two-point LOD score of +3.83 at straight theta = 0 was obtained for markers DXS8090, DXS1069, DXS8102, and DXS8085. This locus spans 7.7cM between DXS1049 and DXS8054 and does not overlap the locus for X-linked West syndrome. The tetraspanin gene, implicated in nonspecific mental retardation, is mapped to this region. We sequenced the tetraspanin coding sequence in subjects with X-linked mental retardation and epilepsy and did not identify disease-specific mutations. The syndrome we describe, designated X-linked mental retardation and epilepsy, is clinically and genetically distinct from X-linked West syndrome and other X-linked mental retardation-epilepsy syndromes."
"Axonal pathology is a major cause of neurological disability in multiple sclerosis. Axonal transection begins at disease onset but remains clinically silent because of compensatory brain mechanisms. Noninvasive surrogate markers for axonal injury are therefore essential to monitor cumulative disease burden in vivo. The neuronal compound N-acetylaspartate, as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, is currently the best and most specific noninvasive marker of axonal pathology in multiple sclerosis. The possibility has been raised, however, that N-acetylaspartate is expressed also by oligodendroglial lineage cells. In order to investigate N-acetylaspartate specificity for white matter axons, transected rat optic nerves were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and immunohistochemistry. In transected adult nerves, N-acetylaspartate and N-acetyl aspartylglutamate decreased in concordance with axonal degeneration and were undetectable 24 days posttransection. Nonproliferating oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, oligodendrocytes, and myelin were abundant in these axon-free nerves. At 24 days posttransection, N-acetylaspartate was increased (42%; p = 0.02) in nontransected contralateral nerves. After transection at postnatal day 4, total N-acetylaspartate decreased by 80% (P14; p = 0.002) and 94% (P20; p = 0.003). In these developing axon-free nerves, 25 to 33% of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells were proliferating. These data validate magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements of N-acetylaspartate as an axon-specific monitor of central nervous system white matter in vivo. In addition, the results indicate that neuronal adaptation can increase N-acetylaspartate levels, and that 5 to 20% of the N-acetylaspartate in developing white matter is synthesized by proliferating oligodendrocyte progenitor cells."
"Use-dependent plasticity, thought to contribute to functional recovery after brain injury, is elicited by motor training. The purpose of this study was to determine if administration of d-amphetamine facilitates the effects of motor training on use-dependent plasticity. Healthy human volunteers underwent a training period of voluntary thumb movements under the effects of placebo or d-amphetamine in different sessions in a randomized double-blind, counterbalanced design. Previous work in a drug-naive condition showed that such training causes changes in the direction of thumb movements evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation and in transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked electromyographic responses. The endpoint measure of the study was the magnitude of training-induced changes in transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked kinematic and electromyographic responses in the d-amphetamine and in the placebo conditions. Motor training resulted in increased magnitude, faster development and longer lasting duration of use-dependent plasticity under d-amphetamine compared to the placebo session. These results document a facilitatory effect of d-amphetamine on use-dependent plasticity, a possible mechanism mediating the beneficial effect of this drug on functional recovery after cortical lesions."
"The protean manifestations of a novel maternally inherited point mutation of the mitochondrial genome are reported. The proband showed isolated, spastic paraparesis. A brother, who had suffered from a multisystem progressive disorder, ultimately died of cardiomyopathy. Another brother is healthy. The proband's mother showed truncal ataxia, dysarthria, severe hearing loss, mental regression, ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, distal cyclones, and diabetes mellitus. A muscle biopsy performed in the proband failed to show the morphological abnormalities typical of mitochondrial disorders; the activities of respiratory chain complexes were normal. However, complex I and IV activities were low in the muscle homogenate of the affected mother and brother. Sequence analysis of mtDNA showed a heteroplasmic mutation of the tRNA(Ile) gene (G4284A). The mutation load was approximately 55%, 80%, and 90% in the muscle mtDNA of the proband, his mother, and his affected brother, respectively. Mutation was undetected in the healthy brother, as well as in 100 control samples. Several cybrid clones containing homoplasmic mutant mtDNA from the proband showed significant reductions of complex IV activity and maximum oxygen consumption rate, compared with homoplasmic wild-type clones derived from the same subject."
"Neurotrophic factors have been demonstrated to prevent the development of peripheral neuropathy in animal models, but the therapeutic use of these factors in human disease has been limited by the short serum half-life and dose-limiting side effects of these potent peptides. We used peripheral subcutaneous inoculation with a replication-incompetent, genomic herpes simplex virus-based vector containing the coding sequence for neurotrophin-3 to transduce sensory neurons of the rat dorsal root ganglion in vivo, and found that expression of neurotrophin-3 from the vector protected peripheral sensory axons from neuropathy induced by intoxication with pyridoxine assessed by electrophysiological (foot sensory response amplitude, and conduction velocity, and H-wave), histological (nerve morphology and morphometry), and behavioral measures of proprioceptive function. In vivo gene transfer using herpes simplex virus vectors provides a unique option for treatment of diseases of the sensory peripheral nervous system."
It has been proposed that somatosensory input in the form of peripheral nerve stimulation can influence functional measures of motor performance. We studied the effects of median nerve stimulation on pinch muscle strength (a function mediated predominantly by median nerve innervated muscles) in the affected hand of chronic stroke patients. A 2-hour period of median nerve stimulation elicited an increase in pinch strength that outlasted the stimulation period. The improvement in muscle strength correlated with stimulus intensity and was identified in the absence of motor training. These results suggest that somatosensory stimulation may be a promising adjuvant to rehabilitation of the motor deficits in stroke patients.
"Hippocampal volume and neuron number were measured using stereological techniques in pathologically confirmed dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 8), Parkinson's disease only (n = 4), and controls (n = 9). We, and others, have previously shown considerable cell loss in the CA1 and subiculum subregions in Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, these regions were spared in dementia with Lewy bodies where a selective loss of lower presubiculum pyramidal neurons was found. These findings suggest a selective loss of frontally projecting hippocampal neurons in dementia with Lewy bodies versus those projecting to temporal lobe regions in Alzheimer's disease."
"Periventricular leukomalacia is one of the main causes of cerebral palsy. Perinatal white matter lesions associated with cerebral palsy appears to involve glutamate excitotoxicity and excess free radical production. When injected intracerebrally into newborn mice, the glutamatergic analog ibotenate induces white matter cysts mimicking human periventricular leukomalacia. Melatonin acts on specific receptors. It also exhibits intrinsic free radical scavenging properties. The goal of the present study is to determine whether melatonin can protect against excitotoxic lesions induced by ibotenate in newborn mice. Mice that received intraperitoneal melatonin had an 82% reduction in size of ibotenate-induced white matter cysts when compared with controls. Although melatonin did not prevent the initial appearance of white matter lesions, it did promote secondary lesion repair. Axonal markers supported the hypothesis that melatonin induced axonal regrowth or sprouting. The protective effects of melatonin were suppressed by coadministration of luzindole, a melatonin receptor antagonist. Forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, prevented the protective effects of melatonin; inhibitors of protein kinase C and mitogen-associated protein kinase had no detectable effect. Melatonin and derivatives that block cAMP production through activation of melatonin receptors could represent new avenues for treating human periventricular leukomalacia."
We studied 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 18 candidate genes for association with Parkinson's disease. We found that homozygosity for the V66M polymorphism of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene occurs more frequently in patients with Parkinson's disease than in unaffected controls (chi(2) = 5.46) and confirmed an association with the S18Y polymorphism of the UCH-L1 gene. Our results provide genetic evidence supporting a role for BDNF in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.
"Limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B and Miyoshi myopathy were recently found to be allelic disorders arising from defects in the dysferlin gene. We have developed a new diagnostic assay for limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B and Miyoshi myopathy, which screens for dysferlin expression in blood using a commercially available monoclonal antibody. Unlike current methods that require muscle biopsy for immunodiagnosis, the new method is simple and entails a significantly less invasive procedure for tissue sampling. Moreover, it overcomes some of the problems associated with the handling and storage of muscle specimens. In our analysis of 12 patients with limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B or Miyoshi myopathy, the findings obtained using the new assay are fully consistent with the results from muscle immunodiagnosis."
"Interleukin-12 is critical to the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in multiple species. Interleukin-10, a dominant endogenous inhibitor of interleukin-12, is largely protective in these experimental surrogates for multiple sclerosis. Such data have suggested that an interleukin-12/interleukin-10 immunoregulatory circuit is a key determinant of disease expression in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. For multiple sclerosis itself, compatible cytokine data have been reported. The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of interferon-beta in multiple sclerosis remain unclear, hampering the search for more effective therapies. Of note, interferon-beta has reciprocal effects on these cytokines in vitro, suppressing interleukin-12 and augmenting interleukin-10 production. To examine the effects of interferon-beta on the interleukin-12/interleukin-10 axis in multiple sclerosis, we characterized the production of these cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients beginning therapy with interferon-beta. Before therapy, multiple sclerosis patients exhibited increased stimulatable interleukin-12 production compared with controls. Interferon-beta therapy leads to inhibition of interleukin-12 and augmentation of interleukin-10 production, significantly elevating the ratio of secreted interleukin-10 to interleukin-12. These effects, observed equally in patients with relapsing-remitting and progressive disease, indicate that interferon-beta affects the interleukin-12/interleukin-10 axis in ways thought to be beneficial to multiple sclerosis patients. More specific therapeutic targeting of these pathways may be warranted."
"To examine the effect of therapy on status epilepticus (SE) acutely and on long-term outcome, we compared three drugs with three different mechanisms. Phenobarbital, MK-801, and phenytoin were administered at 1, 2, and 4 hours after initiation of limbic status epilepticus by ""continuous"" hippocampal stimulation in rats. We evaluated the effects of these drugs on the course of SE and the subsequent development of chronic epilepsy. Phenobarbital and MK-801 were superior to phenytoin in suppressing SE and in preventing chronic epilepsy. There was no benefit if treatment was given 2 hours after the initiation of SE. Phenobarbital was most effective in suppressing electrographic seizure activity, but MK-801 had a slightly wider window for the prevention of chronic epilepsy. Early treatment, rather than electrographic suppression of SE, correlated with prevention of chronic epilepsy. This study shows that the drugs administered, which have different mechanisms of action, have clear differences in altering the outcomes. The findings suggest that studies of SE treatment should examine the effect of therapy on SE itself, as well as the long-term benefits of each treatment. The use of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists should be considered early in the treatment of SE."
"Abnormally phosphorylated tau accumulates as neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads in older persons with and without Alzheimer's disease. The relationship between neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads and how they relate to cognitive function is unknown. This study investigated the relationship between phosphorylated tau lesions and cognitive function in 31 persons participating in the Religious Orders Study, a prospective, longitudinal clinicopathological study of aging and Alzheimer's disease. All subjects underwent detailed neuropsychological performance testing within a year of death and evidenced a spectrum of cognitive performance ranging from normal abilities to mild dementia. Measures of neurofibrillary tangle density and phosphorylated tau immunoreactive structures (predominantly neuropil threads) in the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices by quantitative image analysis were significantly correlated (r = 0.5). In multiple linear regression analyses controlling for age, sex, and education, parahippocampal neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads were significantly lower in persons without cognitive impairment compared to those with mild cognitive impairment and/or Alzheimer's disease. Further, neurofibrillary tangles were significantly correlated to measures of episodic memory but not other cognitive abilities; neuropil tangles were not significantly related to memory or other cognitive functions. These data indicate that phosphorylated tau pathology in the ventromedial temporal lobe develop prior to the onset of clinical dementia and their presence is associated with cognitive impairment, particularly impairment of episodic memory."
"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder that has been associated with alterations of several proteins: peripheral myelin protein 22, myelin protein zero, connexin 32, early growth response factor 2, periaxin, myotubularin related protein 2, N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 product, neurofilament light chain, and kinesin 1B. To determine the frequency of mutations in these genes among patients with CMT or a related peripheral neuropathy, we identified 153 unrelated patients who enrolled prior to the availability of clinical testing, 79 had a 17p12 duplication (CMT1A duplication), 11 a connexin 32 mutation, 5 a myelin protein zero mutation, 5 a peripheral myelin protein 22 mutation, 1 an early growth response factor 2 mutation, 1 a periaxin mutation, 0 a myotubularin related protein 2 mutation, 1 a neurofilament light chain mutation, and 50 had no identifiable mutation; the N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 and the kinesin 1B gene were not screened for mutations. In the process of screening the above cohort of patients as well as other patients for CMT-causative mutations, we identified several previously unreported mutant alleles: two for connexin 32, three for myelin protein zero, and two for peripheral myelin protein 22. The peripheral myelin protein 22 mutation W28R was associated with CMT1 and profound deafness. One patient with a CMT2 clinical phenotype had three myelin protein zero mutations (I89N+V92M+I162M). Because one-third of the mutations we report arose de novo and thereby caused chronic sporadic neuropathy, we conclude that molecular diagnosis is a necessary adjunct for clinical diagnosis and management of inherited and sporadic neuropathy."
"We have explored the use of minocycline, a tetracycline with antiinflammatory properties, to treat chronic relapsing-remitting experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Therapeutic treatment with minocycline dramatically suppresses ongoing disease activity and limits disease progression. Disease suppression is associated with immune deviation in the periphery and with suppression of the inflammatory cascade in the central nervous system. This association is demonstrated by inhibition of microglial activation and metalloproteinase-2 expression, which results in a concomitant decrease in inflammation and demyelination. As an established antiinflammatory drug with neuroprotective properties, minocycline may provide a novel therapeutic agent for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis."
"Although apolipoprotein E epsilon4 is an established risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, its effect on the rate of progression of Alzheimer's disease remains unknown. The purpose of this longitudinal study was to elucidate whether the rate of hippocampal atrophy is a function of the apolipoprotein E genotypes and severity of disease. Fifty-five patients with probable Alzheimer's disease were the subjects. The annual rate of hippocampal atrophy was determined by using magnetic resonance imaging repeated at a 1-year interval. On a two-way analysis of variance, the effect of the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele on hippocampal atrophy was significant, but neither the effect of severity nor the interaction term was significant. In further analysis with one-way analysis of variance, the mean annual rate of hippocampal atrophy was significantly different between the groups of patients with (9.76 +/- 4.27%) and without the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele (6.99 +/- 4.24%). Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 dose was significantly correlated with the rate of hippocampal atrophy (rs = 0.277, Spearman rank correlation coefficient), suggesting a gene dose effect. The involvement of the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele in the progression of hippocampal atrophy has implications for therapeutic approaches in Alzheimer's disease and should be taken into consideration in longitudinal studies including clinical drug trials."
"Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder that causes motor dysfunction, personality changes, dementia, and premature death. There is currently no effective therapy. Several transgenic models of Huntington's disease are available, the most widely used of which is the R6/2 mouse, because of its rapid disease progression. Environmental enrichment alters gene expression in the normal mouse brain, and modulates the course of several neurological disorders. Environmentally enriched mice may actually mimic human disease more accurately. We found that even limited environmental enrichment slows decline in RotaRod performance in R6/2 mice, despite rapid disease progression, whereas in normal littermates, maximal enrichment was required to induce a marked improvement in behavioral tests. Enrichment also delayed the loss of peristriatal cerebral volume in R6/2 brains. These results could provide the basis for a rational approach to ameliorate the effects of Huntington's disease."
"Two siblings (patients 1 and 2) had adult-onset muscle weakness that was greater distally than proximally, as well as respiratory insufficiency, cardiomyopathy, and cervical spine anomalies. Electromyography studies indicated myopathy and findings consistent with neuropathy in both. In the deltoid muscle of patient 1 and the anterior tibial muscle of patient 2, myriad type 1 fibers harbored large, irregularly polygonal, and mostly central hyaline masses, small vacuoles, and nemaline rods flanking the hyaline masses or congregated under the sarcolemma. The hyaline masses are intensely congophilic; react strongly for desmin, alphaB-crystallin, alpha1-antichymotrypsin, and ubiquitin and variably for gelsolin and dystrophin; and are devoid of alpha-actinin, nebulin, titin, and slow myosin. The presence of ubiquitin, gelsolin, and fragmented filaments, and the absence of nebulin, titin, alpha-actinin, and slow myosin in the hyaline masses, signal nonlysosomal protein degradation. Ultrastructurally, the hyaline masses are composed of intermediate-density amorphous material intermingled with fragmented filaments and irregularly branching, pleomorphic, highly electron-dense material, resembling the hyaline structures of myofibrillar myopathy. We conclude that the pathological process in this syndrome is one that induces destruction of myofibrillar components, resulting in aggregation of the degraded residues in hyaline masses, and causes replication of Z disks, resulting in formation of nemaline rods."
"Apolipoprotein E has been implicated in modifying neurological outcome after traumatic brain injury, although the mechanisms by which this occurs remain poorly defined. To investigate the role of endogenous apolipoprotein E following acute brain injury, noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging was performed on anesthetized mice following closed head injury. Effacement of the lateral ventricle was used as a radiographic surrogate for cerebral edema. At 24 hours following injury, apolipoprotein E-deficient animals had a greater degree of cerebral edema as compared to matched controls. In addition, the brains of apolipoprotein E-deficient animals had a significantly greater upregulation of tissue necrosis factor alpha messenger ribonucleic acid as compared to controls as early as 1-hr post injury. Thus, modulation of the endogenous central nervous system inflammatory response may be one mechanism by which apolipoprotein E affects outcome following acute brain injury."
"Rasmussen's encephalitis is a progressive epileptic disorder characterized by unihemispheric lymphocytic infiltrates, microglial nodules, and neuronal loss leading to the destruction of the affected hemisphere. In this study, immunohistochemical evaluation of specimens from 11 patients revealed lymphocytic infiltrates that consisted mainly of CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells. Of these cells, 7.0% lay in direct apposition to MHC class I(+) neurons. Confocal laser microscopy revealed that these lymphocytes contained granzyme B in a polar orientation toward these perikarya. Single neurons underwent apoptosis. These findings indicate that a T-cell-mediated cytotoxic reaction induces neuronal death in Rasmussen's encephalitis. This study directly shows, for what we believe is the first time, that a cytotoxic T-cell mechanism contributes to loss of neurons in human brain disease."
"Intracellular aggregates commonly forming neuronal intranuclear inclusions are neuropathological hallmarks of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and of other disorders characterized by expanded polyglutamine-(poly-Q) tracts. To characterize cellular responses to these aggregates, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis of neuronal intranuclear inclusions in pontine neurons of patients affected by spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, using a panel of antibodies directed against chaperones and proteasome subunits. A subset of the neuronal intranuclear inclusions stained positively for the chaperones Hsp90alpha and HDJ-2, a member of the Hsp40 family. Most neuronal intranuclear inclusions were ubiquitin positive, suggesting degradation by ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathways. Surprisingly, only a fraction of neuronal intranuclear inclusions were immunopositive for antibodies directed against subunits of the 20S proteolytic core, whereas most inclusions were stained by antibodies directed against subunits of the 11S and 19S regulatory particles. These results suggest that the proteosomal proteolytic machinery that actively degrades neuronal intranuclear inclusions is assembled in only a fraction of pontine neurons in end stage spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. The dissociation between regulatory subunits and the proteolytic core and the changes in subcellular subunit distribution suggest perturbations of the proteosomal machinery in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 brains."
"The prospective multicenter NOA-03 trial, conducted by the Neuro-Oncology Working Group (NOA) of the German Cancer Society, was initiated to define the feasibility and efficacy of single-agent high-dose methotrexate therapy without concomitant radiotherapy in immunocompetent patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma. Thirty-seven patients (median age, 60 years) received 179 biweekly courses of 8 g/m2 methotrexate. Response was assessed after 3 and 6 courses. We had planned to enter 105 patients into the trial. Since fewer than the projected 18 of 37 patients achieved a complete response after an intermediate analysis, the trial was closed. In intention-to-treat analysis, 11 of 37 patients (29.7%) achieved complete response, whereas 14 of 37 patients (37.8%) were found to have progressive disease. The median relapse-free survival among complete response patients was 13.7 months. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that corticosteroid application during the first methotrexate course was associated with complete response. The regimen was well tolerated, but, unlike previously reported results, the activity of high-dose methotrexate was only moderate."
"Caspase 1 plays a pivotal role in generating mature cytokine interleukin-1beta. Interleukin-1beta is implicated as a mediator of pneumococcal meningitis, both in experimental models and in humans. We demonstrated here that (1) Caspase 1 mRNA and protein expression is upregulated in the brain during experimental pneumococcal meningitis, and (2) Caspase 1 levels are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with acute bacterial meningitis. The upregulation/activation of Caspase 1 was associated with increased levels of interleukin-1beta. Depletion of the Caspase 1 gene and pharmacologic blockade of Caspase 1 significantly attenuated the meningitis-induced increase in interleukin-1beta. This was paralleled by a significantly diminished inflammatory host response to pneumococci. The antiinflammatory effect of Caspase 1 depletion or blockade was associated with a marked reduction of meningitis-induced intracranial complications, thus leading to an improved clinical status. In humans, cerebrospinal fluid Caspase 1 levels correlated with the clinical outcome. Thus, pharmacologic inhibition may provide an efficient adjuvant therapeutic strategy in this disease."
"The etiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis remains unknown in the majority of cases. Homozygous SMN1 (survival motor neuron) gene deletion causes spinal muscular atrophy, and SMN2 gene deletions are possible risk factors in lower motor neuron disease. We studied SMN1 and SMN2 genes copy numbers in 167 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients and in 167 matched controls. We noted that 16% of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients had an abnormal copy number of the SMN1 gene (1 or 3 copies), compared with 4% of controls. An abnormal SMN1 gene locus may be a susceptibility factor for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."
"Memory function commonly declines in later life. Whether memory decline represents a disease process or whether it is part of normal aging remains unknown. Here we answer this question by assessing the function of multiple subregions that make up the hippocampal circuit across the human life span. A newly developed MRI approach--designed to detect functional changes in individual hippocampal subregions--was used to assess the hippocampal circuit in 70 subjects between 20 and 88 years of age. Using strict parametric criteria, analysis revealed that function in two hippocampal subregions--the subiculum and the dentate gyrus--decline normally with age. In contrast, function in the entorhinal cortex declines pathologically. Single-subject analysis revealed that hippocampal dysfunction, found in 60% of elders was selectively correlated with memory decline. These results show that memory decline is caused by different mechanisms and suggests how memory decline should be approached clinically."
"Two new loci, PARK6 and PARK7, for autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism have recently been identified on chromosome 1p, in single large pedigrees. Among 4 autosomal recessive early-onset families analyzed here, 2 supported linkage to PARK7, 1 with conclusive evidence. These data confirm localization of autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism to PARK7, suggesting it to be a frequent locus. Assignment of families to either PARK6 or PARK7 might be difficult because of the proximity of the two loci on chromosome 1p."
"Tumor suppressor gene ""knockout"" models would predict that children who present with hemangioblastoma are likely to harbor germline mutation of the von Hippel-Lindau gene. We screened 6 pediatric patients with cerebellar hemangioblastoma for germline or somatic mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau gene. Two had prior clinical manifestations of von Hippel-Lindau disease and, as expected, had germline von Hippel-Lindau gene mutations. Four children with solitary hemangioblastoma did not have a detectable germline deletion, rearrangement, or point mutation in their von Hippel-Lindau gene, and tumor specimens in 3 of these 4 showed no somatic von Hippel-Lindau allelic loss. Solitary cerebellar hemangioblastoma in children does not predict a germline or somatic mutation in the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene. The tumorigenesis of hemangioblastoma in younger patients may differ from that in adults, and may involve a molecular process unrelated to the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor pathway."
"The prodynorphin gene (PDYN) encoding the anticonvulsant peptide dynorphin is a strong candidate for a seizure suppressor gene and thus a possible modulator of susceptibility to temporal lobe epilepsy. We performed a case control association study in 155 patients with nonlesional temporal lobe epilepsy and 202 controls and found that PDYN promotor low-expression L-alleles confer an increased risk for temporal lobe epilepsy in patients with a family history for seizures. Irrespective of the familial background, L-homozygotes display a higher risk for secondarily generalized seizures and status epilepticus."
"Silent brain infarcts and white matter lesions are frequently seen on magnetic resonance imaging in healthy elderly people and both are associated with an increased risk of stroke and dementia. Plasma total homocysteine may be a potentially modifiable risk factor for stroke and dementia. We examined whether elevated total homocysteine levels are associated with silent brain infarcts and white matter lesions. The Rotterdam Scan Study is a population-based study of 1,077 people aged 60 to 90 years who had cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. The cross-sectional relation of total homocysteine with silent infarcts and white matter lesions was analyzed with adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. The mean plasma total homocysteine level was 11.5 micromol/l (standard deviation 4.1). The risk of silent brain infarcts increased with increasing total homocysteine levels (odds ratio 1.24/standard deviation increase, 95% confidence interval 1.06-1.45). The severity of periventricular white matter lesions and extent of subcortical white matter lesions were also significantly associated with total homocysteine levels, even after excluding those with silent brain infarcts. The overall risk of having either a silent brain infarct or severe white matter lesions was strongly associated with total homocysteine levels (odds ratio 1.35/standard deviation increase, 95% confidence interval 1.16-1.58). We concluded that total homocysteine levels are associated with silent brain infarcts and white matter lesions independent of each other and of other cardiovascular risk factors."
"Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is a recently defined autosomal recessive disorder. The course is chronic progressive with additional episodes of rapid deterioration, provoked by fever and minor head trauma. A previous study showed that mutations in the genes encoding the epsilon- or the beta-subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2B, a complex consisting of five subunits, cause the disease in most patients. Seven unsolved patients remained. The unsolved patients were investigated by mutation analysis of the genes encoding the alpha-, gamma-, and delta-subunit of eIF2B and the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of eIF2, because phosphorylation of this latter subunit regulates eIF2B activity. Mutations were found in the genes encoding the alpha- (1 patient), gamma- (2 patients), and delta-subunits (2 patients) of eIF2B, but no mutations were found in the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of eIF2. In 2, both less typical patients, no mutations were found. Mutations in all five genes eIF2B subunit genes can cause VWM. eIF2B is essential for the initiation of translation of RNA into protein and is involved in regulation of the process, especially under circumstances of stress, such as fever. A defect in eIF2B may explain the sensitivity to stress factors in vanishing white matter patients."
"We performed genomewide linkage analysis of a Japanese family with autosomal dominant parkinsonism, which exhibits clinical features compatible with those of common Parkinson's disease. Parametric two-point linkage analysis yielded a highest log odds (LOD) score of 4.32 at D12S345 (12p11.21). Parametric multipoint linkage analysis of the 13.6cM interval around this marker yielded LOD scores almost uniformly of &gt;4.0 with a Z(max) of 4.71 at D12S85 (12q12). Haplotype analysis detected two obligate recombination events at D12S1631 and D12S339 and defined the disease-associated haplotype in the 13.6cM interval in 12p11.2-q13.1. This haplotype was shared by all the patients and by some unaffected carriers, suggesting that disease penetration in this family is incomplete. This low penetrance suggests that environmental or other genetic factors modify expression of the disease. Nonparametric two-point and multipoint linkage analyses, which are penetrance-independent, yielded Z(max) LOD scores of 14.2 and 24.9 at D12S345, respectively, strongly supporting the mapping of the parkinsonism locus in this family to 12p11.23-q13.11. This chromosome region is different from any known locus for hereditary parkinsonism, in keeping with the unique genetic features of the parkinsonism in this family. The nomenclature of PARK8 was assigned to the new locus."
"Superior oblique myokymia is a rare movement disorder thought to be caused by vascular compression of the trochlear nerve. Direct display of such neurovascular compression by magnetic resonance imaging has been lacking. The goal of this study was to assess the presence of neurovascular contacts in patients with superior oblique myokymia, using a specific magnetic resonance imaging protocol. A total of 6 patients suffering from right superior oblique myokymia underwent detailed neuro-ophthalmological examination, which showed tonic or phasic eye movement. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging, using a magnetic resonance imaging Fourier transform constructive interference in steady-state sequence in combination with magnetic resonance imaging time of flight magnetic resonance arteriography both before and after the administration of Gd-DTPA. With this protocol, the trochlear nerve could be visualized on 11 of 12 sides (92%). Arterial contact was detected at the root exit zone of the symptomatic right trochlear nerve in all 6 patients (100%). No arterial contact was identified at the root exit zone of the asymptomatic left trochlear nerve in any of the 5 left nerves visualized. In conclusion, superior oblique myokymia can result from neurovascular contact at the root exit zone of trochlear nerve, and therefore should be considered among the neurovascular compression syndromes."
"X-linked lissencephaly with absent corpus callosum and ambiguous genitalia is a newly recognized syndrome responsible for a severe neurological disorder of neonatal onset in boys. Based on the observations of 3 new cases, we confirm the phenotype in affected boys, describe additional MRI findings, report the neuropathological data, and show that carrier females may exhibit neurological and magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities. In affected boys, consistent clinical features of X-linked lissencephaly with absent corpus callosum and ambiguous genitalia are intractable epilepsy of neonatal onset, severe hypotonia, poor responsiveness, genital abnormalities, and early death. On magnetic resonance imaging, a gyration defect consisting of anterior pachygyria and posterior agyria with a moderately thickened brain cortex, dysplastic basal ganglia and complete agenesis of the corpus callosum are consistently found. Neuropathological examination of the brain shows a trilayered cortex containing exclusively pyramidal neurons, a neuronal migration defect, a disorganization of the basal ganglia, and gliotic and spongy white matter. Finally, females related to affected boys may have mental retardation and epilepsy, and they often display agenesis of the corpus callosum. These findings expand the phenotype of X-linked lissencephaly with absent corpus callosum and ambiguous genitalia, may help in the detection of carrier females in affected families, and give arguments for a semidominant X-linked mode of inheritance."
"We investigated whether 5 to 20mg per week oral methotrexate could slow down disease progression in 44 patients with inclusion body myositis in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study over 48 weeks. Mean change of quantitative muscle strength testing sum scores was the primary study outcome measure. Quantitative muscle strength testing sum scores declined in both treatment groups, -0.2% for methotrexate and -3.4% for placebo (95% confidence interval = -2.5% to +9.1% for difference). There were also no differences in manual muscle testing sum scores, activity scale scores and patients' own assessments after 48 weeks of treatment. Serum creatine kinase activity decreased significantly in the methotrexate group. We conclude that oral methotrexate did not slow down progression of muscle weakness but decreased serum creatine kinase activity."
"We explored the hypothesis that components of verbal memory are subserved by separate temporal lobe structures in patients with temporal lobe structures in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy [correction]. Uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) measured by positron emission tomography, hippocampal volume, and memory for arbitrarily and semantically related verbal paired associates were examined in 27 patients with left temporary lobe epilepsy. Scores from memory tests performed outside the scanner were regressed against normalized resting FDG uptake at each voxel. Significant regression was seen in the left perirhinal cortex (Talaraich coordinates x, y, z: -29, 10, -34; p &lt; 0.05) for arbitrarily related word pairs. For semantically related paired associates, significant regression was present in the left inferior temporal gyrus (x, y, z: -48, -18, -24; p &lt; 0.05). In subsequent analyses, mean FDG uptake within a spherical region of interest centered on the perirhinal peak predicted performance on both tasks. Mean FDG uptake in a region of interest centered on the inferior temporal peak made an additional, independent contribution to memory for semantically related pairs. Hippocampal volumes did not explain any additional variance in memory scores. Our findings indicate that heterogeneity in the left temporal lobe structures mediating verbal memory function, and support the view that the perirhinal cortex is an important mnemonic substrate."
"We applied multislice, whole-brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to two patients with anaplastic astrocytoma. Data were analyzed using DTI-based, color-coded images and a 3-D tract reconstruction technique for the study of altered white matter anatomy. Each tumor was near two major white matter tracts, namely, the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the corona radiata. Those tracts were identified using the color-coded maps, and spatial relationships with the tumors were characterized. In one patient the tumor displaced adjacent white matter tracts, whereas in the other it infiltrated the superior longitudinal fasciclus without displacement of white matter. DTI provides new information regarding the detailed relationship between tumor growth and nearby white matter tracts, which may be useful for preoperative planning."
"Mutations in the tau gene cause familial frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17. In this article, we describe a novel missense mutation, S320F, in the tau gene in a family with presenile dementia. To our knowledge, it is the first mutation to be described in exon 11 of tau. The proband died at age 53 years, after a disease duration of 15 years, and autopsy revealed a neuropathological picture similar to Pick's disease. Recombinant tau protein with the S320F mutation showed a greatly reduced ability to promote microtubule assembly."
"Multiple gene defects cause Batten disease. Accelerated apoptosis accounts for neurodegeneration in the late infantile and juvenile forms that are due to defects in the CLN3 and CLN2 genes. Extensive neuronal death is seen in CLN2- and CLN3-deficient human brain as well as in CLN6-deficient sheep brain and retina. When neurons in late infantile and juvenile brain survive, they manage to do so by upregulating the neuroprotective molecule Bcl-2. The CLN3 gene has antiapoptotic properties at the molecular level. We show that the CLN2 gene is neuroprotective: it enhances growth of NT2 cells and maintains survival of human postmitotic hNT neurons. Conversely, blocking CLN3 or CLN2 expression in hNT neurons with adenoviral antisense-CLN3 or antisense-CLN2-AAV2 constructs causes apoptosis. The drug flupirtine is a triaminopyridine derivative that acts as a nonopioid analgesic. Flupirtine upregulates Bcl-2, increases glutathione levels, activates an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, and delays loss of intermitochondrial membrane calcium retention capacity. We show that flupirtine aborts etoposide-induced apoptosis in CLN1-, CLN2-, CLN3-, and CLN6-deficient as well as normal lymphoblasts. Flupirtine also prevents the death of CLN3- and CLN2-deficient postmitotic hNT neurons at the mitochondrial level. We show that a mechanism of neuroprotection exerted by flupirtine involves complete functional antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate or N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced neuronal apoptosis. Flupirtine may be useful as a drug capable of halting the progression of neurodegenerative diseases caused by dysregulated apoptosis."
"Stroke is a prevalent and devastating disorder, and no treatment is currently available to restore lost neuronal function after stroke occurs. One unique therapy that may improve functional recovery after stroke is blockade of the neurite inhibitory protein Nogo-A with the monoclonal antibody IN-1, through enhancement of neuroanatomical plasticity from uninjured areas of the central nervous system. In the present study, we combined IN-1 treatment with an ischemic lesion (permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion) to determine the effect of Nogo-A neutralization on cortical plasticity and functional recovery. We report here that, following ischemic stroke and treatment with IN-1, adult rats demonstrated functional recovery on a forelimb-reaching task and new cortico-efferent projections from the opposite, unlesioned hemisphere. These results support the efficacy of Nogo-A blockade as a treatment for ischemic stroke and implicate plasticity from the unlesioned hemisphere as a mechanism for recovery."
"Based on previous studies demonstrating increased RAS activity in human astrocytomas, we developed a transgenic mouse model (B8) that targets an activated RAS molecule to astrocytes. Within 3 to 4 months after birth, these mice develop high-grade astrocytomas that are histologically identical to human astrocytomas. To characterize genetic events associated with B8 mouse astrocytoma formation, we employed comparative gene expression profiling of wild-type cultured mouse astrocytes, non-neoplastic B8 astrocytes, B8 astrocytoma cultures, and two other astrocytoma cultures from independently derived RAS transgenic mouse lines. We identified several classes of gene expression changes, including those associated with the non-neoplastic state in the B8 transgenic mouse, those associated with astrocytoma formation, and those specifically associated with only one of the three independently derived transgenic mouse astrocytomas. Differential expression of several unique genes was confirmed at the protein level in both the RAS transgenic mouse astrocytomas and two human glioblastoma multiforme cell lines. Furthermore, reexpression of one of these downregulated astrocytoma-associated proteins, GAP43, resulted in C6 glioma cell growth suppression. The use of this transgenic mouse model to identify novel genetic changes that might underlie the pathogenesis of human high-grade astrocytomas provides a unique opportunity to discover future targets for brain tumor therapy."
"There is evidence that the clinical course of multiple sclerosis is age related. The present study evaluated the relationship between age and rate of disability progression in a large hospital-based cohort of definite cases of multiple sclerosis (n= 1,463). Patients were followed every 6 to 12 months for a total period of observation of 11,387.8 person-years. Expanded Disability Status Scale scores increased significantly with increasing current age and longer duration of disease (p=0.007). Median times to reach Expanded Disability Status Scale scores of 4.0 and 6.0, assessed using an extended Kaplan-Meier method with age as a categorical time-varying covariate, were significantly longer among patients aged 20 to 35 years compared with patients aged 36 to 50 and 51 to 65 years (p &lt; 0.0001). Significant associations were observed between mean Expanded Disability Status Scale scores and age at disease onset, current age, and the interaction of age at disease onset and current age (p &lt; 0.001). Current age had a greater effect (59% of variability in the model) on disease severity than did age at disease onset. Furthermore, a multiplicative effect on Expanded Disability Status Scale score was observed for age at disease onset and current age combined, indicating a faster rate of disease progression in older patients. In conclusion, the results of the current study demonstrate the impact of age on rate of disability progression in multiple sclerosis and suggest that an age-adjusted progression index may be a more relevant criterion for defining differences between multiple sclerosis groups."
"This functional magnetic resonance imaging study verified an antagonistic pattern in which a concomitant deactivation of ipsilateral primary sensorimotor (SM1) was coupled to the contralateral SM1 activation in healthy controls during unimanual hand grasping. Of note, dramatic reduction of ipsilateral SM1 deactivation (loss of antagonistic pattern) was observed during movement of intact hands by patients with unilateral brachial plexus injury. We propose that the disappearance of the antagonistic pattern of SM1 activities in the patients with brachial plexus injury reflects a reduction of interhemispheric inhibition, which may mirror an adaptive mechanism to functional status."
"This case report is of a patient with 46XY pure gonadal dysgenesis, who presented with chronic progressive motor and sensory polyneuropathy. The sural nerve biopsy exhibited minifascicle formations accompanied by a marked decrease in myelinated fibers. This is the first report of polyneuropathy with minifascicle formations in 46XY pure gonadal dysgenesis. Because a similar polyneuropathy was recently reported in a case with 46XY partial gonadal dysgenesis, it is possible that these cases represent a new type of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy associated with gonadal dysgenesis."
"We report on a 25-year-old patient with isolated mitochondrial complex III deficiency and a new heteroplasmic mutation (T14849C) in the cytochrome b gene. He suffered from septo-optic dysplasia, retinitis pigmentosa, exercise intolerance, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and rhabdomyolysis. A HESX1 mutation was excluded as a cause of his septo-optic dysplasia. Low alpha-tocopherol concentrations in his muscles and an elevated urinary leukotriene E(4) excretion indicate increased production of reactive oxygen species."
"Patients with probable Alzheimer's disease and depressive patients frequently present with subjective memory complaints. Objective distinction of underlying neuronal substrate malfunction and early cross-sectional differential diagnosis have been elusive thus far. We used repetitive learning and free recall of abstract geometric patterns during functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess episodic memory in older subjects (ages 56-64 years) who sought first-time medical attention with subjective memory complaints and were diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease (NINCDS-ADRDA criteria; ages 51-67 years) or major depressive disorder (DSM-IV; ages 50-65 years). Contrasting healthy seniors or depressive patients with Alzheimer's disease patients revealed superiority of hippocampal activation. Contrasting Alzheimer's disease patients with seniors showed bilateral prefrontal activity as a correlate of futile compensation of episodic memory failure. Contrasting patients who had major depressive disorder with seniors or patients who had Alzheimer's disease showed bilateral activation of the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate. Subjective memory complaints may be classified objectively and very early with functional magnetic resonance imaging of episodic memory in groups of patients with Alzheimer's disease and depressive syndrome. This may facilitate drug trials with evaluation of specific treatments, but further studies will be needed to establish the differential diagnosis for the individual patient."
"Cortical spreading depression (CSD) may be the underlying mechanism of migraine aura. The role of CSD in initiating a migraine headache remains to be determined, but it might involve specific changes in gene expression in the brain. To examine these changes, four episodes of CSD at 5-minute intervals were induced in the mouse brain by application of 300mM KCl, and gene expression was examined 2 hours later using cDNA array and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Controls consisted of groups that received anesthesia only, attachment of recording electrodes only, and application of 0.9% NaCl. Of the over 1,180 genes examined in our experiments, those consistently regulated by CSD included vasoactive peptides; the vasodilator atrial natriuretic peptide was induced by CSD, while the vasoconstrictor neuropeptide Y was downregulated. Other genes specifically regulated by CSD were involved in oxidative stress responses (major prion protein, glutathione-S-transferase-5, and apolipoprotein E). L-type calcium channel mRNA was upregulated. In summary, CSD regulates genes that are intrinsic to its propagation, that identify accompanying vascular responses as a potential source of pain, and that protect against its potential pathological consequences. We believe these observations have strong relevance to the mechanisms of migraine and its outcomes."
"Nitric oxide (NO) generated from inducible NO synthase (iNOS) participates in immune and inflammatory responses in many tissues. The NO donor glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) provokes delayed migraine attacks when infused into migraineurs and also causes iNOS expression and delayed inflammation within rodent dura mater. Sodium nitroprusside, an NO donor as well, also increases iNOS expression. Because inflammation and iNOS are potential therapeutic targets, we examined transcriptional regulation of iNOS following GTN infusion and the consequences of its inhibition within dura mater. We show that intravenous GTN increases NO production within macrophages. L-N(6)-(1-iminoethyl)lysine, a selective iNOS inhibitor, attenuates the NO signal, emphasizing the importance of enzymatic activity to delayed NO production. iNOS expression is preceded by significant nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity, as reflected by a reduction in the inhibitory protein-kappa-Balpha (IkappaBalpha) and activation of NF-kappaB after GTN infusion. IkappaBalpha degradation, NF-kappaB activation, and iNOS expression were attenuated by parthenolide (3mg/kg), the active constituent of feverfew, an anti-inflammatory drug used for migraine treatment. These findings suggest that GTN promotes NF-kappaB activity and inflammation with a time course consistent with migraine attacks in susceptible individuals. We conclude, based on results with this animal model, that blockade of NF-kappaB activity provides a novel transcriptional target for the development of anti-migraine drugs."
"The development of interventions designed to delay the onset of dementia highlights the need to determine the neuropathologic characteristics of individuals whose cognitive function ranges from intact to demented, including those with mild cognitive impairments. We used the Braak method of staging Alzheimer's disease pathology in 130 women ages 76-102 years who were participants in the Nun Study, a longitudinal study of aging and Alzheimer's disease. All participants had complete autopsy data and were free from neuropathologic conditions other than Alzheimer's disease lesions that could affect cognitive function. Findings showed a strong relationship between Braak stage and cognitive state. The presence of memory impairment was associated with more severe Alzheimer's disease pathology and higher incidence of conversion to dementia in the groups classified as having mild or global cognitive impairments. In addition to Braak stage, atrophy of the neocortex was significantly related to the presence of dementia. Our data indicate that Alzheimer's neurofibrillary pathology is one of the neuropathologic substrates of mild cognitive impairments. Additional studies are needed to help explain the variability in neuropathologic findings seen in individuals whose cognitive performance falls between intact function and dementia."
"Narcolepsy is a lifelong, crippling sleep disorder. Although the discovery of the hypocretin system has been a breakthough in genetics, the epidemiological aspects of narcolepsy remain elusive. Ethnic predisposition was suggested to partially account for the 2,500-fold difference in the reported prevalence rates of narcolepsy between Japanese (0.59%) and Israeli Jews (0.00023%). We carried out a general population study, conducting a random telephone survey with a structured questionnaire, which included a validated screening instrument (a Chinese version of the Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale). It was followed by clinical-polysomnographic-HLA confirmation of the subjects determined to be positive for narcolepsy based on the questionnaire. Of 9,851 subjects interviewed, 28 subjects (0.28%, 58% female) were screened positive. Ninety percent had a second detailed interview, 64% had HLA typing, and over half of them had a sleep assessment. Only three subjects were found to have genuine narcolepsy. The most common nonnarcolepsy diagnoses were sleep apnea syndrome and sleep-wake schedule disorder. The prevalence rate of narcolepsy in Southern (Hong Kong) Chinese was found to be 0.034% (95% confidence interval = 0.010-0.117%). All available narcoleptic subjects were HLA DRB1-1501 positive and 50% were DQB1-0602 positive. The prevalence rate of narcolepsy among Chinese is comparable to the rates for other populations in studies with stringent epidemiological designs, suggesting that major cross-ethnic differences in the prevalence rates of narcolepsy previously reported likely resulted from methodological limitations."
"We report a case of frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 of 5 years' duration in an 81-year-old man whose brother had died at age 86 years with dementia. In this patient, we found frontal and temporal neuronal loss, glial-predominant tau deposits, progressive supranuclear palsy-like straight tubules, accumulation of 4-repeat-predominant Sarkosyl-insoluble tau, and a novel exon 1 (Arg5His) tau gene mutation. This mutation decreased microtubule-promoting capacity and increased fibrillation of tau in vitro. Thus, we consider that the Arg5His mutation is an authentic tau gene abnormality responsible for the patient's tau pathology and late-onset dementia."
"Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase was analyzed in cerebrospinal fluid samples taken from children with a variety of neurological conditions (85 patients; mean age, 3.8 years) to determine it is involved in the defense mechanism against the toxic effect of inflammatory mediators in the central nervous system. A significant increase in cerebrospinal fluid activity was seen in the patients with meningitis and acute febrile illness in comparison with the control subjects. The activity was also significantly higher in the patients with meningitis than in the patients with inflammatory neurological diseases. In addition, the biochemical profile of cerebrospinal fluid platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase was different from other known acetylhydrolases. These findings suggest that cerebrospinal fluid platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase activity may be a sensitive marker of the host response to central nervous system infections."
"We report the identification of two new 7-year-old patients with 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, a recently described inborn error of isoleucine metabolism. The defect is localized one step above 3-ketothiolase, resulting in a urinary metabolite pattern similar to that seen for deficiency of the latter. One patient has progressive neurodegenerative symptoms, whereas the clinical phenotype of the other patient is characterized by psychomotor retardation without loss of developmental milestones. A short-term biochemical response to an isoleucine-restricted diet was observed in both children."
"In this study, we compared direct postmortem in situ (whole-corpse) sagittal spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (1.5T) of 7 multiple sclerosis cases with targeted high-resolution in vitro axial magnetic resonance imaging (4.7T) and histopathology. On sagittal in situ magnetic resonance imaging, 1 case had a normal spinal cord, 2 had only focal lesions, 3 had a combination of focal and diffuse abnormalities, and 1 had only diffuse abnormalities. All spinal cords showed abnormalities on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology, confirming the existence of diffuse cord changes as genuine multiple sclerosis-related abnormalities while highlighting the limited resolution of in vivo magnetic resonance imaging."
"This longitudinal quantitative magnetic resonance imaging study of 24 patients with mild temporal lobe epilepsy shows an ipsilateral hippocampal volume decrease of 9% (range, -30 to +0.5%; p = 0.002, paired t test) over a period of 3.5 +/- 0.7 years. The hippocampal volume loss was correlated to the number of generalized seizures between the scans (p = 0.0007, r = 0.6), suggesting seizure-associated hippocampal damage."
"Autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia is a mitochondrial disorder characterized by multiple large deletions of mitochondrial DNA. A recent study showed pathogenic heterozygous missense mutations in the heart/skeletal muscle isoform of the adenine nucleotide translocator 1 gene in autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia patients. In one Japanese autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia family, we found a novel A-to-G heterozygous mutation at nucleotide 311 of the adenine nucleotide translocator 1 gene, which segregated with affected individuals and could not be detected in the genomic DNA sequence of 120 normal controls. This mutation converted a highly conserved aspartic acid into a glycine at codon 104. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of single muscle fibers showed the presence of one type of deletion in each fiber, suggesting clonal expansion of mitochondrial DNA with deletions. These findings support the pathogenesis of the adenine nucleotide translocator 1 gene mutation in human disease."
"We report electrophysiological features and magnetic resonance imaging muscle findings in 4 patients and 1 female carrier of X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy. Motor units were polyphasic with high mean amplitude and normal duration. The thigh muscles were most severely involved, but myotonic discharges were abundant in both clinically affected and unaffected muscles. Along with the clinicopathological features, these electrophysiological findings distinguish X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy from other limb-girdle myopathies."
"Some patients with focal hand dystonia have impaired sensory perception. Abnormal sensory processing may lead to problems with fine motor control. For patients with focal hand dystonia who demonstrate sensory dysfunction, sensory training may reverse sensory impairment and dystonic symptoms. We studied the efficacy of learning to read braille as a method of sensory training for patients with focal hand dystonia. Sensory spatial discrimination was evaluated in 10 patients who had focal hand dystonia and 10 age- and gender-matched controls with a spatial acuity test (JVP domes were used in this test). Clinical dystonia evaluation included the Fahn dystonia scale and time needed to write a standard paragraph. Each individual was trained in braille reading at the grade 1 level for 8 weeks, between 30 and 60 minutes daily, and was monitored closely to ensure that reading was done regularly. Both controls and patients demonstrated improvement on the spatial acuity test. Patients showed a significant mean difference from baseline to 8 weeks on the Fahn dystonia scale. Sixty percent of the patients shortened the time they needed to write a standard paragraph. Improved sensory perception correlated positively with improvement on the Fahn dystonia scale. We conclude that training in braille reading improves deficits in spatial discrimination and decreases disability in patients with focal hand dystonia."
"It is assumed that brain biopterin and dopamine loss should not be as severe in asymptomatic dopa-responsive dystonia caused by GCH1 mutations as it is in symptomatic dopa-responsive dystonia. However, the actual status of dopaminergic systems in asymptomatic cases is unknown. In the autopsied putamen of an asymptomatic GCH1 mutation carrier, we found that brain biopterin loss (-82%) paralleled that reported in dopa-responsive dystonia patients (-84%). However, tyrosine hydroxylase protein and dopamine levels (-52 and -44%, respectively) were not as severely affected as in symptomatic patients (exceeding -97 and -88%, respectively). Our data suggest that the extent of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase protein loss may be critical in determining dopa-responsive dystonia symptomatology."
"Barth syndrome is an X-linked cardiac and skeletal mitochondrial myopathy. Barth syndrome may be due to lipid alterations because the product of the mutated gene is homologous to phospholipid acyltransferases. Here we document that a single mitochondrial phospholipid species, tetralinoleoyl-cardiolipin, was lacking in the skeletal muscle (n = 2), right ventricle (n = 2), left ventricle (n = 2), and platelets (n = 6) of 8 children with Barth syndrome. Tetralinoleoyl-cardiolipin is specifically enriched in normal skeletal muscle and the normal heart. These findings support the notion that Barth syndrome is caused by alterations of mitochondrial lipids."
A novel mitochondrial DNA C4171A mutation in the ND1 gene in two Korean families with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is described. All affected patients recovered spontaneously after suffering months to years of initial visual loss. This mutation replaces leucine with methionine in a conserved extramembrane loop of the ND1 gene and was absent in 514 normal controls and in 63 Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy lineages harboring the primary mutations. We consider mitochondrial DNA C4171A/ND1 a primary causative mutation of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy with a good prognosis.
"Paraneoplastic chorea is described in 16 patients: 11 with limited small-cell carcinoma, 2 with lung cancer revealed by imaging, 1 with renal cell carcinoma, and 1 with lymphoma. All had CRMP-5-IgG; 6 also had ANNA-1 (anti-Hu), including 1 without evident cancer. Chorea was the initial and most prominent symptom in 11 patients, asymmetric or unilateral in 5 patients, and part of a multifocal syndrome in 14 patients. Basal ganglia abnormalities were revealed by magnetic resonance imaging and at autopsy (as perivascular inflammation and microglial activation). Four patients improved with chemotherapy, and 2 improved with intravenous methylprednisolone."
"Early-onset parkinsonism is frequently reported in connection with mutations in the parkin gene. In this study, we present the results of extensive genetic screening for parkin mutations in 111 community-derived early-onset parkinsonism patients (age of onset &lt;50 years) from Germany with an overall mutation rate of 9.0%. Gene dosage alterations represented 67% of the mutations found, underlining the importance of quantitative analyses of parkin. In summary, parkin mutations accounted for a low but significant percentage of early-onset parkinsonism patients in a community-derived sample."
"Ovarian steroids appear to alter neuronal function in women, but direct physiological evidence is lacking. In animals, estradiol enhances excitatory neurotransmission. Progesterone-derived neurosteroids increase GABAergic inhibition. The effect of weak transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex on the motor evoked potential (MEP) from transcranial magnetic stimulation given milliseconds later is changed by GABAergic and glutamatergic agents. Using this technique previously, we showed more inhibition in the luteal phase relative to the midfollicular menstrual phase, which is consistent with a progesterone effect. To detect the effects of estradiol, we have now divided the follicular phase. We tested 14 healthy women during the early follicular (low estradiol, low progesterone), late follicular (high estradiol, low progesterone), and luteal (high estradiol, high progesterone) phases, with interstimulus intervals from 2 to 10msec (10 trials at each interval and 40 unconditioned trials). We calculated the ratio of the conditioned MEP at each interval to the mean unconditioned MEP: the higher the ratio, the less inhibition and the more facilitation caused by the first stimulus. The combined ratios increased significantly from the early follicular phase to the late follicular phase and then decreased again in the luteal phase. These findings demonstrate an excitatory neuronal effect associated with estradiol and confirm our earlier finding of inhibition associated with progesterone."
"We investigated the relationship between cerebral activity (measured with positron emission tomography) and word rate in normal subjects and aphasic patients listening to monosyllabic words at rates up to those encountered in normal speech. By measuring the slope of the regression of the individual activity-word rate responses in the temporal cortex in normal subjects, we identified a functional asymmetry in the posterior superior temporal sulcus. The response was greater (steeper) on the left. Using the same study design, we identified a steeper activity-word rate response in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus of patients who had recovered single-word auditory comprehension after infarction of the left posterior temporal cortex. This response was significantly different from that observed in both normal subjects and a group of patients with left hemisphere infarcts that spared the posterior temporal cortex. The results demonstrated a change in physiological responsiveness in the contralateral homotopic cortex after posterior temporal infarction."
"Distal spinal muscular atrophy is a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders caused by progressive anterior horn cell degeneration and characterized by progressive motor weakness and muscular atrophy, predominantly in the distal parts of the limbs. Here we report on chronic autosomal recessive distal spinal muscular atrophy in a large, inbred family with onset at various ages. Because this condition had some of the same clinical features as spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress, we tested the disease gene for linkage to chromosome 11q and mapped the disease locus to chromosome 11q13 in the genetic interval that included the spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress gene (D11S1889-D11S1321, Z(max) = 4.59 at theta = 0 at locus D11S4136). The sequencing of IGHMBP2, the human homologue of the mouse neuromuscular degeneration gene (nmd) that accounts for spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress, failed to detect any mutation in our chronic distal spinal muscular atrophy patients, suggesting that spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress and chronic distal spinal muscular atrophy are caused by distinct genes located in the same chromosomal region. In addition, the high intrafamilial variability in age at onset raises the question of whether nonallelic modifying genes could be involved in chronic distal spinal muscular atrophy."
"Vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 and benzodiazepine binding site expressions were examined with quantitative autoradiography in postmortem striata from 19 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies, seven patients with dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease, 12 patients with Alzheimer's disease, and eight neurologically normal subjects. Striatal vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 expression in dementia with Lewy bodies and in dementia with Lewy bodies plus Alzheimer's disease was reduced significantly, indicating degeneration of nigrostriatal projections. Striatal benzodiazepine binding site expression was unchanged, indicating preserved intrinsic striatal neuropil. Vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 and benzodiazepine binding site expressions were each preserved in Alzheimer's disease striatum. We conclude that dementia with Lewy bodies may be distinguished from Alzheimer's disease by postmortem examination or by future in vivo measurements of the striatal vesicular monoamine transporter type 2."
"The short-duration response, long-duration response, and dyskinetic response to levodopa change during long-term levodopa therapy. How these responses evolve, and which changes contribute to the emergence of motor fluctuations, remain unclear. We studied 18 subjects with Parkinson's disease before they began levodopa therapy and after 6, 12, 24, and 48 months of long-term levodopa therapy. The responses to 2-hour levodopa infusions after overnight and after 3 days of levodopa withdrawal were studied from 6 months onward. The mean magnitude of the short-duration response and the long-duration response measured after overnight without antiparkinsonian medications did not change during the 4 years. However, after 3 days without levodopa, it was apparent that the short-duration-response magnitude was progressively increasing (p &lt; 0.0001) and that the long-duration response was decaying more rapidly (p = 0.0004). The short-duration-response magnitude at 4 years was inversely related to the long-duration-response magnitude (p = 0.022), suggesting that the long-duration response was one determinant of the short-duration-response magnitude. Dyskinesia increased progressively in severity during the study (p = 0.013). The duration of the short-duration response and dyskinesia did not change during the 4 years. Subject reports of motor fluctuations tended to be associated with a large short-duration response (p = 0.054). We suggest that a larger long-duration response, rather than a shortened one, is more important to the development of fluctuations. Improving the baseline or practical-off motor function to reduce the magnitude of the short-duration response may be a strategy to treat fluctuations."
"Deprenyl (selegiline) delays the need for levodopa therapy in patients with early Parkinson's disease, but the long-term benefits of this treatment remain unclear. During 1987 to 1988, 800 patients with early Parkinson's disease were randomized in the Deprenyl and Tocopherol Antioxidative Therapy of Parkinsonism trial to receive deprenyl, tocopherol, combined treatments, or a placebo and were then placed on active deprenyl (10mg/day). A second, independent randomization was carried out in early 1993 for 368 subjects who by that time had required levodopa and who had consented to continuing the deprenyl treatment (D subjects) or changing to a matching placebo (P subjects) under double-blind conditions. The first development of wearing off, dyskinesias, or on-off motor fluctuations was the prespecified primary outcome measure. During the average 2-year follow-up, there were no differences between the treatment groups with respect to the primary outcome measure (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.63, 1.19; p = 0.38), withdrawal from the study, death, or adverse events. Although 34% of D subjects developed dyskinesias and only 19% of P subjects did (p = 0.006), only 16% of D subjects developed freezing of gait but 29% of P subjects did (p = 0.0003). Decline in motor performance was less in D subjects than P subjects. Levodopa-treated Parkinson's disease patients who had been treated with deprenyl for up to 7 years, compared with patients who were changed to a placebo after about 5 years, experienced slower motor decline and were more likely to develop dyskinesias but less likely to develop freezing of gait."
"The genetic cause of sickle cell disease has been known for decades, yet the reasons for its clinical variability are not fully understood. The neurological complications result from one point mutation that causes vasculopathy of both large and small vessels. Anemia and the resultant cerebral hyperemia produce conditions of hemodynamic insufficiency. Sickled cells adhere to the endothelium, contributing to a cascade of activated inflammatory cells and clotting factors, which result in a nidus for thrombus formation. Because the cerebrovascular reserve becomes exhausted, the capacity for compensatory cerebral mechanisms is severely limited. There is evidence of small-vessel sludging, and a relative deficiency of nitric oxide in these vessels further reduces compensatory vasodilatation. Both clinical strokes and silent infarcts occur, affecting motor and cognitive function. New data suggest that, in addition to sickle cell disease, other factors, both environmental (eg, hypoxia and inflammation) and genetic (eg, mutations resulting in thrombogenesis), may contribute to a patient's stroke risk. The stroke risk is polygenic, and sickle cell disease can be considered a model for all cerebrovascular disease. This complex disease underscores the potential intellectual and practical distance between the determination of molecular genetics and effective clinical application and therapeutics."
"A novel mitochondrial DNA nucleotide transversion, C14482A (M64I), different from the previously reported C14482G (M64I), was found to cause Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy with visual recovery in an Italian family. These equivalent changes are the fifth pathogenic mutation for pure Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. This confirms that the ND6 gene of complex I is a mutational hot spot and suggests that different amino acid substitutions at residue 64, as induced by C14482G or C14482A (M64I) and the common T14484C (M64V) mutations, are associated with visual recovery."
"Hypersensitivity syndrome, a serious systematic reaction to a limited number of drugs, is associated with the reactivation of human herpesvirus 6. A 56-year-old man developed acute limbic encephalitis followed by multiple organ failure during the course of toxic dermatitis induced by aromatic anticonvulsants. The clinical features of skin eruptions, high fever, eosinophilia, and atypical lymphocytosis were compatible with drug hypersensitivity syndrome. The patient showed seroconversion for human herpesvirus 6, and polymerase chain reaction detected human herpesvirus 6 DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid. To our knowledge, this is the first report of human herpesvirus 6 encephalitis associated with hypersensitivity syndrome."
"Hereditary spastic paraplegia is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by progressive spasticity of the lower limbs. Seven loci for autosomal dominant pure hereditary spastic paraplegia (ADPHSP) have already been mapped on chromosomes 14q, 2p, 15q, 8p, 12q, 19q, and 2q. We report on an Italian family affected by ADPHSP for which we excluded linkage with the known loci and performed a genome-wide search. Linkage analysis and haplotype construction permitted the identification of a novel ADPHSP locus on the long arm of chromosome 9, designated SPG19. The phenotype was characterized by late onset (range, 36-55 years) and mild disability, with only 1 patient bound to a wheelchair after 31 years of disease. Urinary disturbances (urgency and/or incontinence) were always present, even in young patients with a short disease history."
"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment ameliorates the course of Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome (GBS), but its specific mode of action is unknown. We attempted to delineate the effect of IVIg on neuromuscular blocking antibodies in GBS. A total of seven GBS serum samples were examined for blocking antibodies and the effect of IVIg with a macro-patch-clamp technique in mouse hemidiaphragms. First, serum was tested before and after treatment with IVIg. Second, we investigated with coincubation experiments whether the IVIg was capable of neutralizing neuromuscular blocking antibodies in GBS serum or affinity-purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) fractions. Finally, the mechanism of the neutralizing effect was studied by the coincubation of active blocking GBS IgG with Fab and Fc fragments prepared from IVIg. All GBS sera (two adults and two children) and GBS IgG fractions (three adults) taken before treatment with IVIg blocked evoked quantal release by approximately 90%. Blocking activity was markedly reduced in sera obtained after treatment with IVIg. Coincubation of the pretreatment blocking serum with the posttreatment serum, or with the IVIg preparation used for treatment, reduced the blocking activity of the pretreatment GBS serum. When GBS IgG was coincubated with IVIg, the blocking activity of GBS IgG was diminished dose-dependently. Monovalent and divalent Fab fragments prepared from the IVIg were as effective as whole IVIg, but Fc fragments were ineffective. Therapeutic IVIg is capable of neutralizing neuromuscular blocking antibodies in GBS by a dose-dependent, antibody-mediated mechanism. This may, in part, explain its therapeutic efficacy."
"The development of clinical symptoms in multiple sclerosis and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) involves T-cell activation and migration into the central nervous system, production of glial-derived inflammatory molecules, and demyelination and axonal damage. Ligands of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) exert anti-inflammatory effects on glial cells, reduce proliferation and activation of T cells, and induce myelin gene expression. We demonstrate in two models of EAE that orally administered PPARgamma ligand pioglitazone reduced the incidence and severity of monophasic, chronic disease in C57BL/6 mice immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide and of relapsing disease in B10.Pl mice immunized with myelin basic protein. Pioglitazone also reduced clinical signs when it was provided after disease onset. Clinical symptoms were reduced by two other PPARgamma agonists, suggesting a role for PPARgamma activation in protective effects. The suppression of clinical signs was paralleled by decreased lymphocyte infiltration, lessened demyelination, reduced chemokine and cytokine expression, and increased inhibitor of kappa B (IkB) expression in the brain. Pioglitazone also reduced the antigen-dependent interferon-gamma production from EAE-derived T cells. These results suggest that orally administered PPARgamma agonists could provide therapeutic benefit in demyelinating disease."
"Because genetic defects relating to the ubiquitin-proteasome system were reported in familial parkinsonism, we evaluated proteasomal function in autopsied brains with sporadic Parkinson's disease. We found that proteasome peptidase activities in a fraction specific to the proteasome were preserved in five brain areas (including the striatum) of Parkinson's disease where neuronal loss is not observed. Striatal protein levels of two proteasome subunits were normal in Parkinson's disease but reduced mildly in disease controls (multiple system atrophy). Our brain data suggest that a systemic, global disturbance in the catalytic activity and degradation ability of the proteasome itself is unlikely to explain the cause of Parkinson's disease."
"Beta-secretase cleavage represents the first step in the generation of Abeta polypeptides and initiates the amyloid cascade that leads to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. By comparative Western blot analysis, we show a 2.7-fold increase in protein expression of the beta-secretase enzyme BACE in the brain cortex of Alzheimer's disease patients as compared to age-matched controls. Similarly, we found the levels of the amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragment produced by beta-secretase to be increased by nearly twofold in Alzheimer's disease cortex."
"In this large cross-sectional population-based study, 51,272 persons responded to a headache questionnaire and were screened for hemochromatosis. Phenotypic hemochromatosis and the C282Y/C282Y genotype were both associated with an 80% increase in headache prevalence evident only among women. The reason for this association is unclear, but one may speculate that iron overload alters the threshold for triggering a headache by disturbing neuronal function."
We studied the impact of cerebral amyloid angiopathy on tissue plasminogen activator-induced cerebral hemorrhages in APP23 transgenic mice. Results show that the intravenous administration of tissue plasminogen activator in APP23 mice leads to an increase in cerebral amyloid angiopathy-associated microhemorrhages and can provoke parenchymal and subarachnoidal hematomas. We conclude that cerebral amyloid angiopathy is a risk factor for cerebral hemorrhage caused by tissue plasminogen activator administration in mice and stress the need for more comprehensive studies of the relation between cerebral amyloid angiopathy and tissue plasminogen activator-induced cerebral hemorrhages in elderly and Alzheimer's disease patients.
"An outbreak of infection with the Nipah virus, a novel paramyxovirus, occurred among pig farmers between September 1998 and June 1999 in Malaysia, involving 265 patients with 105 fatalities. This is a follow-up study 24 months after the outbreak. Twelve survivors (7.5%) of acute encephalitis had recurrent neurological disease (relapsed encephalitis). Of those who initially had acute nonencephalitic or asymptomatic infection, 10 patients (3.4%) had late-onset encephalitis. The mean interval between the first neurological episode and the time of initial infection was 8.4 months. Three patients had a second neurological episode. The onset of the relapsed or late-onset encephalitis was usually acute. Common clinical features were fever, headache, seizures, and focal neurological signs. Four of the 22 relapsed and late-onset encephalitis patients (18%) died. Magnetic resonance imaging typically showed patchy areas of confluent cortical lesions. Serial single-photon emission computed tomography showed the evolution of focal hyperperfusion to hypoperfusion in the corresponding areas. Necropsy of 2 patients showed changes of focal encephalitis with positive immunolocalization for Nipah virus antigens but no evidence of perivenous demyelination. We concluded that a unique relapsing and remitting encephalitis or late-onset encephalitis may result as a complication of persistent Nipah virus infection in the central nervous system."
"Previous studies have demonstrated that apparent loss-of-function mutations in the periaxin gene cause autosomal recessive Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy or severe demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. In this report, we extend the associated phenotypes with the identification of two additional families with novel periaxin gene mutations (C715X and R82fsX96) and provide detailed neuropathology. Each patient had marked sensory involvement; two siblings with a homozygous C715X mutation had much worse sensory impairment than motor impairment. Despite early disease onset, these siblings with the C715X mutation had relatively slow disease progression and adult motor impairment typical of classic demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. In contrast, a patient with the homozygous R82fsX96 mutation had a disease course consistent with Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy. The neuropathology of patients in both families was remarkable for demyelination, onion bulb and occasional tomacula formation with focal myelin thickening, abnormalities of the paranodal myelin loops, and focal absence of paranodal septate-like junctions between the terminal loops and axon. Our study indicates a prominent sensory neuropathy resulting from periaxin gene mutations and suggests a role for the carboxyl terminal domain of the periaxin protein."
"Sengers syndrome is characterized by congenital cataracts, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitochondrial myopathy, and lactic acidosis, but no abnormalities have been found with routine mitochondrial biochemical diagnostics (the determination of pyruvate oxidation rates and enzyme measurements). In immunoblot analysis, the protein content of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT1) was found to be strongly reduced in the muscle tissues of two unrelated patients with Sengers syndrome. In addition, low residual adenine nucleotide translocator activity was detected upon the reconstitution of detergent-solubilized mitochondrial extracts from the patients' skeletal or heart muscle into liposomes. Sequence analysis and linkage analysis showed that ANT1 was not the primary genetic cause of Sengers syndrome. We propose that transcriptional, translational, or posttranslational events are responsible for the ANT1 deficiency associated with the syndrome."
"Angiostrongylus cantonensis is the most common cause of eosinophilic meningitis and meningoencephalitis. Almost all cases are self-limiting and are diagnosed by cerebrospinal fluid eosinophilia and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; pathology reports are restricted to postmortem samples from lethal cases. We report on what we believe is the first case of A. cantonensis infection diagnosed by biopsy in a living patient. The spinal cord was biopsied because of the unusual clinical presentation of a myelopathy without meningeal symptoms, together with a mass lesion that was clinically and radiologically diagnosed as a spinal cord tumor."
"R2* mapping has recently been used to detect iron overload in patients with movement disorders. We demonstrate here that this technique can also be used to detect reduced brain iron, as in the case of a missense mutation in the iron-transporting protein divalent metal transporter 1. Surprisingly, we found that the same brain regions are affected (ie, the globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and cerebellar dentate nucleus); this suggests a much more extensive role for these structures in regulating overall brain iron homeostasis. Therefore, for the clinical monitoring of movement disorders for which normal brain iron homeostasis (either overload or reduction) may be implicated, R2* mapping appears to be well-suited."
"Portions of chromosomes 1p and 19q, which are frequently deleted in oligodendrogliomas, are subject to genomic imprinting, suggesting that the putative tumor suppressor genes could be monoallelically expressed. The parental origins of 1p and 19q allele losses were determined in 6 cases of pure oligodendroglioma. An equilibrated parental loss (3 maternal and 3 paternal) was found for 1p deletions. In contrast, 19q deletions always occurred on the paternal copy (p = 0.015). In this setting, a cloning strategy based on a search for homozygous deletion or mutation of the remaining allele would be appropriate for identifying the tumor suppressor gene located on 1p but inappropriate for identifying the presumably monoallelically expressed tumor suppressor gene located on 19q."
"Age and severity of extrapyramidal signs have been consistently associated with incident dementia in Parkinson's disease. We evaluated the separate and combined effects of age and severity of extrapyramidal signs on the risk of incident dementia in Parkinson's disease in the setting of a population-based prospective cohort study. Age and the total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score at baseline evaluation were dichotomized at the median. Four groups of Parkinson's disease patients were defined: younger age/low severity (reference), younger age/high severity, older age/low severity, and older age/high severity. Risk ratios for incident dementia were calculated with Cox proportional hazards models controlling for gender, education, ethnicity, and duration of Parkinson's disease. Of 180 patients, 52 (28.9%) became demented during a mean follow-up period of 3.6 +/- 2.2 years. The median age at baseline of the Parkinson's disease patients was 71.8 years (range, 38.5-95.9 years), and the median total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score was 24 (range, 2-65). The group with older age/high severity had a significantly increased risk of incident dementia (relative risk, 9.7; 95% confidence interval, 3.9-24.4) compared with the group with younger age/low severity (reference), whereas the groups with older age/low severity (relative risk, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-4.8) and younger age/high severity (relative risk, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-3.2) did not. These findings suggest that the increased risk of incident dementia in Parkinson's disease associated with age and severity of extrapyramidal signs is related primarily to their combined effect rather than separate effects."
"The genetic analysis of simple Mendelian epilepsies remains a key strategy in advancing our understanding of epilepsy. In this article, we describe a new family epilepsy syndrome, partial epilepsy with pericentral spikes, which we map to chromosome 4p15. We distinguish it clinically, electrophysiologically, and genetically from previously described Mendelian epilepsies. The family described is a large Brazilian kindred of Portuguese extraction in which affected family members manifest a variety of seizure types, including hemiclonic, hemitonic, generalized tonic-clonic, simple partial (stereotyped episodes of epigastric pain), and complex partial seizures consistent with temporal lobe epilepsy. The syndrome is benign, either requiring no treatment or responding to a single antiepileptic medication. Seizure onset is in the first or second decades of life, with seizures in individuals up to the age of 71 years and documented encephalogram changes up to the age of 30 years. A key feature of partial epilepsy with pericentral spikes is a characteristic encephalogram abnormality of spikes or sharp waves in the pericentral region (centroparietal, centrofrontal, or centrotemporal). This distinctive encephalogram abnormality of pericentral spikes unites these several seizure types into a discrete family epilepsy syndrome. As with other familial epilepsies, the inherited nature of this new syndrome may be overlooked because of the variability in penetrance and seizure types among affected family members."
"Pick's disease is characterized neuropathologically by distinct tau-immunoreactive intraneuronal inclusions known as Pick bodies and by insoluble tau proteins with predominantly three microtubule-binding repeat tau isoforms. However, recent immunohistochemical studies showed that the antibody specific for exon 10, which encodes the fourth microtubule-binding repeat, detected other tau lesions in Pick's disease. To better define the spectrum of tau pathology in Pick's disease, we used biochemical, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural techniques to analyze the tau isoform composition in 14 Pick's disease brains. Western blot analysis showed that both three and four microtubule-binding repeat pathological tau isoforms are present in gray and white matter of various brain regions. Using phosphorylation-dependent anti-tau antibodies, we show that major tau phosphoepitopes are present in sarcosyl-insoluble gray and white matter regions of Pick's disease brains. Also, for the first time to our knowledge, we demonstrated that isoforms with four microtubule-binding repeat tau isoforms are present in Pick bodies from selected brains. Isolated tau filaments were straight or twisted and formed by three microtubule-binding repeat or four microtubule-binding repeat tau isoforms. Major tau phosphorylation-dependent and exon 10-specific epitopes were present in filaments. Therefore, Pick's disease is characterized by an accumulations of Pick bodies in the hippocampal region and cortex as well as the presence of three and four microtubule-binding repeat tau pathology in both cortical gray and white matter that distinguish this tauopathy from other neurodegenerative disorders."
"Through the Australian National Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Registry, 6 pathologically confirmed sporadic cases were recognized over a 13-year period in persons who had been long-term residents of a moderate-sized rural city, whereas the expected number was 0.923. An extensive investigation could not find any point-source or case-to-case transmission links. This occurrence is highly statistically significant (p = 0.0027) when viewed in isolation and remains significant (p &lt; 0.02) when only the cases that arose after the cluster was recognized were taken into account. However, a more conservative statistical analysis suggests that such a grouping could have arisen by chance in at least one population group of this size when the whole country is taken into consideration."
"Anti-Hu antibody is an antineuronal autoantibody found in a subset of patients with paraneoplastic neurological disease. The antibody was first associated with small cell carcinoma of the lung and is most often used as a marker for this neoplasm in patients presenting with suspected paraneoplastic syndromes. Here we report a patient with a multifaceted neurological disorder in the setting of Merkel cell carcinoma. The patient's serum contained antibodies against the Hu antigen, and the expression of the Hu antigen was demonstrated in the patient's tumor."
"The minicolumn is an anatomical and functional unit of the brain whose genesis accrues from germinal cell divisions in the ventricular zone of the brain. Disturbances in the morphometry of minicolumns have been demonstrated recently for both autism and Down's syndrome. We report minicolumnar abnormalities in the brain of a dyslexic patient. The corresponding developmental disturbance (ie, large minicolumns) could account for the perceptual errors observed in dyslexia."
"Transcranial magnetic stimulation was performed in 2 patients with focal motor seizures in the right hand caused by a circumscribed tumor process affecting the left precentral gyrus. In both cases, paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation showed a loss of intracortical inhibition for interstimulus intervals of 2 to 4msec that was replaced by an enormous facilitation in the lesioned hand motor cortex. The uniform impairment of inhibitory mechanisms in epileptogenic tumors with different histologies suggests a common, nonspecific cause of tumor-related epileptogenesis."
"Multi-minicore disease is an autosomal recessive congenital myopathy characterized by the presence of multiple, short-length core lesions (minicores) in both muscle fiber types. These lesions being nonspecific and the clinical phenotype being heterogeneous, multi-minicore disease boundaries remain unclear. To identify its genetic basis, we performed a genome-wide screening in a consanguineous Algerian family in which three children presented in infancy with moderate weakness predominant in axial muscles, pelvic girdle and hands, joint hyperlaxity (hand involvement phenotype), and multiple minicores. We mapped the disease to chromosome 19q13 in this family and, subsequently, in three additional families showing a similar phenotype, with a maximum LOD score of 5.19 for D19S570. This locus was excluded in 16 other multi-minicore disease families with predominantly axial weakness, scoliosis, and respiratory insufficiency (""classical"" phenotype). In the Algerian family, we identified a novel homozygous missense mutation (P3527S) in the ryanodine receptor type 1 gene, a positional candidate gene responsible for the autosomal dominant congenital myopathy central core disease. New muscle biopsies from the three patients at adulthood demonstrated typical central core disease with rods; no cores were found in the healthy parents. This subgroup of families linked to 19q13 represents the first variant of central core disease with genetically proven recessive inheritance and transient presentation as multi-minicore disease."
"A deficiency of succinate dehydrogenase is a rare cause of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. Three patients, 2 sisters and 1 boy from an unrelated family, presented with symptoms and magnetic resonance imaging signs of leukoencephalopathy. Localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated a prominent singlet at 2.40ppm in cerebral and cerebellar white matter not present in gray matter or basal ganglia. The signal was also elevated in cerebrospinal fluid and could be identified as originating from the two equivalent methylene groups of succinate. Subsequently, an isolated deficiency of complex II (succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) was demonstrated in 2 patients in muscle and fibroblasts. One of the sisters died at the age of 18 months. Postmortem examination showed the neuropathological characteristics of Leigh syndrome. Her younger sister, now 12 months old, is also severely affected; the boy, now 6 years old, follows a milder, fluctuating clinical course. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy provides a characteristic pattern in succinate dehydrogenase deficiency."
"We identified a family with lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 deficiency (Danon disease) associated with a novel 883 ins-T mutation in the lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 gene located at Xq24. Although the affected son and daughter carried the same mutation, it was not detected in their mother's peripheral blood or buccal cells; this indicated germline mosaicism. This is the first molecular evidence for germline mosaicism in Danon disease and has important implications for genetic counseling."
"This study addressed whether cardiac sympathetic denervation progresses over time in Parkinson's disease. In 9 patients without orthostatic hypotension, 6-[(18)F]fluorodopamine positron emission tomography scanning was repeated after a mean of 2 years from the first scan. 6-[(18)F]fluorodopamine-derived radioactivity was less in the second scan than in the first scan, by 31% in the left ventricular free wall and 16% in the septum. In Parkinson's disease, loss of cardiac sympathetic denervation progresses in a pattern of loss suggesting a dying-back mechanism."
"Controversy exists whether acute hyperglycemia is causally associated with worse stroke outcome or simply reflects a more severe stroke. In reversible ischemia models, hyperglycemia is associated with lactic acidosis and conversion of penumbral tissue to infarction. However, the relationship between hyperglycemia, lactic acidosis, and stroke outcome has not been explored in humans. Sixty-three acute stroke patients were prospectively evaluated with serial diffusion-weighted and perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and acute blood glucose measurements. Patients with hypoperfused at-risk tissue were identified by acute perfusion-diffusion lesion mismatch. As a substudy, acute and subacute magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed in the 33 most recent patients to assess the relationship between acute blood glucose and lactate production in the ischemic region. In 40 of 63 patients with acute perfusion-diffusion mismatch, acute hyperglycemia was correlated with reduced salvage of mismatch tissue from infarction, greater final infarct size, and worse functional outcome. These correlations were independent of baseline stroke severity, lesion size, and diabetic status. Furthermore, higher acute blood glucose in patients with perfusion-diffusion mismatch was associated with greater acute-subacute lactate production, which, in turn, was independently associated with reduced salvage of mismatch tissue. In contrast, acute blood glucose levels in nonmismatch patients did not independently correlate with outcome measures, nor was there any acute-subacute increase in lactate in this group. Acute hyperglycemia increases brain lactate production and facilitates conversion of hypoperfused at-risk tissue into infarction, which may adversely affect stroke outcome. These findings support the need for randomized controlled trials of aggressive glycemic control in acute stroke."
"Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in the perinatal period is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Presently, there are no proven effective therapies with which to safeguard the human neonatal brain against this type of injury. Minocycline, a semisynthetic tetracycline, has been shown to be neuroprotective in certain adult ischemic injury/stroke and neurodegenerative disease models. However, minocycline's neuroprotective effects have not been assessed after insults to the neonatal brain. We now report that minocycline administered either immediately before or immediately after a hypoxic-ischemic insult substantially blocks tissue damage in a rodent model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Minocycline treatment prevents the formation of activated caspase-3, a known effector of apoptosis, as well as the appearance of a calpain cleaved substrate, a marker of excitotoxic/necrotic cell death. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a systemic treatment that can be administered after a hypoxic-ischemic insult, which provides robust, nearly complete neuroprotection to the developing brain. Our data suggest that minocycline or a related neuroprotective tetracycline may be a candidate to consider in human clinical trials to protect the developing brain against hypoxic-ischemic-induced damage."
"The purpose of this study was to assess whether structural brain damage as detected by volumetric magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) is present in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and, if so, whether these abnormalities are global in character or restricted to the temporal lobe. Volumetric MTI analysis of the whole brain and temporal and frontal lobes was performed in 25 patients with probable AD, in 13 patients with MCI, and in 28 controls. Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) histograms were produced, from which we derived measures for structural brain damage and atrophy. The peak heights of the MTR histograms of MCI and AD patients were lower than those of controls for the whole brain and temporal and frontal lobes, reflecting structural brain damage. AD patients had more atrophy than controls in all regions that were studied. MCI patients differed from controls for temporal lobe atrophy only. Volumetric MTI demonstrates structural changes that are related to cognitive decline in large parts of the brain of AD patients. Moreover, structural changes also were observed in MCI patients, indicating that widespread brain damage can be demonstrated before patients are clinically demented."
"Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV (HSAN-IV) and type V (HSAN-V) are autosomal recessive genetic disorders, both characterized by a lack of pain sensation. We report a girl with clinical and neurophysiological findings consistent with a diagnosis of HSAN-V. We sequenced her TRKA gene, encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase for nerve growth factor and responsible for HSAN-IV, but we could not detect any mutation. These data indicate that a gene (or genes) other than TRKA is probably responsible for HSAN-V in some patients."
"Among creatine deficiency syndromes, an X-linked condition related to a defective creatine transport into the central nervous system has been described recently. Hallmarks of the disease are the absence of a creatine signal at brain spectroscopy, increased creatine levels in blood and urine, ineffectiveness of oral supplementation, and a mutation in the SLC6A8 (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] 300036) creatine transporter gene. We report on a patient in whom a novel mutation (1221-1223delTTC) was identified."
"Recently, a homozygous single-nucleotide deletion in exon 2 of the deoxyguanosine kinase gene (DGUOK) was identified as the disease-causing mutation in 3 apparently unrelated Israeli-Druze families with depleted hepatocerebral mitochondrial DNA. We have discovered a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 3 of DGUOK (313C--&gt;T) from a patient born to nonconsanguineous German parents. This finding shows that mutations in DGUOK causing mitochondrial DNA depletion are not confined to a single ethnic group."
"An 8.5-year-old girl with a pathogenic mutation (515insC) of the ATP-binding cassette, subfamily D, member 1 gene (ABCD1) on her maternally derived X chromosome showed clinical, biochemical, and magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities similar to those in affected males. Cytogenetic studies led to the surprise finding of a de novo deletion of Xq27 on the paternally derived X chromosome. A bone marrow transplant had an apparently favorable effect. Cytogenetic studies should be performed in all severely symptomatic X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy heterozygotes."
We describe a 39-year-old patient with a cerebellar infarct and a history of a tetralogy of Fallot corrected during childhood. This is the first documented case of vertebrobasilar stroke occurring as a late complication of a Blalock-Taussig shunt followed by total cardiac repair.
"To investigate the effects of traumatic brain injury on working memory in children, we administered semantic (letter identity) and phonological (letter rhyme) N-back tasks to children who were on average 5 years post-mild (n = 54) or -severe (n = 26) traumatic brain injury and 44 typically developing children who were comparable in age. The correct detection of targets and false alarms were measured for each task. Memory load (which varied from 0 to 3 letters back) and age significantly affected the detection of targets and false alarms in both tasks. The severity of traumatic brain injury affected the correct detection of letters on the identity task and false alarms on the rhyme task. Traumatic brain injury severity also interacted with memory load in its effect on false alarms on the rhyme task. Traumatic brain injury results in impaired working memory and diminished inhibition in children. The N-back working memory task is feasible for administration to brain-injured children and potentially could be useful for studying brain activation associated with working memory and effects of drug therapy in this group of patients."
"Naturally occurring antibodies directed against beta-amyloid (Abeta) were detected in intravenous immunoglobulin preparations. After intravenous immunoglobulin treatment in patients with different neurological diseases, total Abeta and Abeta(1-42) in the cerebrospinal fluid was reduced significantly compared with baseline values. In the serum, total Abeta levels increased after intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, whereas no significant change was observed in Abeta(1-42) levels. Antibodies against Abeta were found to be increased in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid after intravenous immunoglobulin treatment. This study provides evidence that intravenous immunoglobulin or purified Abeta antibodies may modify Abeta and Abeta(1-42) levels, suggesting potential utility as a therapy for Alzheimer disease."
"Deep-brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus appears to reduce levodopa-induced dyskinesias, but whether this effect is caused by the reduction of the total levodopa ingestion or represents a direct effect on the motor system is unknown. Precision grip force of grasping movements and levodopa-induced dyskinesias was analyzed in 10 parkinsonian patients before and after 3 months of deep-brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus. Peak grip force was abnormally increased before surgery in the off-drug state and, particularly, in the on-drug state (sensitization). This grip force upregulation normalized with chronic deep-brain stimulation in both conditions (desensitization). Peak-dose dyskinesias also improved, and off-dystonia was completely abolished. Mean dosage of dopaminergic drugs was reduced, but force overflow and dyskinesias were equally improved in 2 patients without a reduction. Despite the same single levodopa test dose, force excess and levodopa-induced dyskinesias were drastically reduced after 3 months of deep-brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus. This indicates that direct effects of deep-brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus on levodopa-induced dyskinesias are likely to occur. Grip force overflow is a promising parameter to study the desensitizing effect of chronic deep-brain stimulation on levodopa-induced dyskinesias."
"The possibility of detecting acute hypoxic-ischemic brain lesions by prenatal magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound is low. We present a case of a fetus with a vein of Galen arteriovenous malformation in whom prenatal diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging at 33 weeks of gestation clearly detected cerebral acute ischemic lesions, associated with remarkable decrease of the average apparent diffusion coefficient, whereas T2-weighted imaging was still not informative."
"Ross syndrome consists of segmental hyperhidrosis with widespread anhidrosis, Adie syndrome, and areflexia. The cause of this disorder is unknown. Selective degeneration of cholinergic fibers or of neural crest-derived structures has been suggested. We present clinical and skin biopsy data of 4 patients, providing evidence of reduced cholinergic sweat gland innervation in hypohidrotic skin by morphometric analysis. These findings indicate a selective degenerative process of the cholinergic sudomotor neurons."
"Normokalemic periodic paralysis (normoKPP) is well established in the literature, but there are doubts as to whether it exists as a discrete entity. Retrospective clinical and molecular analysis has confirmed suspicions that most normoKPP families actually have a variant of hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (hyperKPP) due to a mutation of the muscle-specific sodium channel gene (SCN4A). However, the original normoKPP family described by Poskanzer and Kerr (Poskanzer DC, Kerr DNS. A third type of periodic paralysis, with normokalemia and favourable response to sodium chloride. Am J Med 1961;31:328-342) has remained unchallenged. We identified the Met1592Val mutation of SCN4A in an affected descendent of this original normoKPP family. This is the final piece in the puzzle: normoKPP is actually a variant of hyperKPP and is not a distinct disorder."
"We used (15)O-labeled water and positron emission tomography to assess the effect of deep brain stimulation of the internal globus pallidus on motor sequence learning in Parkinson's disease. Seven right-handed patients were scanned on and off stimulation while they were performing a motor sequence learning task and a kinematically matched motor execution reference task. The scans were performed after a 12-hour medication washout. Stimulation parameters were adjusted for maximal motor improvement; experimental task parameters were held constant across stimulation conditions. Internal globus pallidus stimulation improved motor ratings by 37% (p &lt; 0.01). During the sequence learning task, stimulation improved performance as measured by several correct anticipatory movements (p &lt; 0.01) and by verbal report (p &lt; 0.001). Concurrent positron emission tomography imaging during learning demonstrated significant (p &lt; 0.01) increases in brain activation with stimulation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilaterally in premotor cortex, and in posterior parietal and occipital association areas. Stimulation did not affect the activity of these regions during the performance of the motor execution reference task. These findings suggest that internal globus pallidus deep brain stimulation can enhance the activity of prefrontal cortico-striato-pallidothalamic loops and related transcortical pathways. Improved sequence learning with stimulation may be directly related to these functional changes."
"Neurons are continually born from endogenous stem cells and added to the dentate gyrus throughout life, but adult hippocampal neurogenesis declines precipitously with age. Short-term exposure to an enriched environment leads to a striking increase in new neurons, along with a substantial improvement in behavioral performance. Could this plastic response be relevant for explaining the beneficial effects of leading ""an active life"" on brain function and pathology? Adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice living in an enriched environment from the age of 10 to 20 months was fivefold higher than in controls. Relatively, the increase in neuronal phenotypes was entirely at the expense of newly generated astrocytes. This cellular plasticity occurred in the context of significant improvements of learning parameters, exploratory behavior, and locomotor activity. Enriched living mice also had a reduced lipofuscin load in the dentate gyrus, indicating decreased nonspecific age-dependent degeneration. Therefore, in mice signs of neuronal aging can be diminished by a sustained active and challenging life, even if this stimulation started only at medium age. Activity exerts not only an acute but also a sustained effect on brain plasticity."
"Ischemic forearm exercise invariably causes muscle cramps and pain in patients with glycolytic defects. We investigated an alternative diagnostic exercise test that may be better tolerated. Nine patients with McArdle disease, one with the partial glycolytic defect phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency, and nine matched, healthy subjects performed the classic ischemic forearm protocol and an identical protocol without ischemia. Blood was sampled in the median cubital vein of the exercised arm. Plasma lactate level increased similarly in healthy subjects during ischemic (Delta5.1 +/- 0.7mmol L(-1)) and non-ischemic (Delta4.4 +/- 0.3) tests and decreased similarly in McArdle patients (Delta-0.10 +/- 0.02 vs Delta-0.40 +/- 0.10mmol L(-1)). Postexercise peak lactate to ammonia ratios clearly separated patients and healthy controls in ischemic (McArdle, 4 +/- 2 [range, 1-12]; partial glycolytic defect phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency, 6; healthy, 33 +/- 4 [range, 17-56]) and non-ischemic (McArdle, 5 +/- 1 [range, 1-10]; partial glycolytic defect phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency, 5; healthy, 42 +/- 3 [range, 35-56]) protocols. Similar differences in lactate to ammonia ratio between patients and healthy subjects were observed in two other work protocols using intermittent handgrip contraction at 50% and static handgrip exercise at 30% of maximal voluntary contraction force. All patients developed pain and cramps during the ischemic test, and four had to abort the test prematurely. No patient experienced cramps in the non-ischemic test, and all completed the test. The findings indicate that the diagnostic ischemic forearm test for glycolytic disorders should be replaced by an aerobic forearm test."
"We investigated whether HSV gene transfer of HSP72 in vivo and in vitro: (1) protected cornu ammonis 1 region of the hippocampus neurons from global cerebral ischemia; and (2) affected Bcl-2 expression. HSV vectors expressing HSP72 and beta-galactosidase (reporter) or beta-galactosidase only (control vector) were injected into cornu ammonis 1 region of the hippocampus 15 hours before induction of global cerebral ischemia (n = 10) and sham-operated rats (n = 8). HSP72 vector-treated rats displayed significantly more surviving transfected neurons (X-gal-positive, 31 +/- 8) compared with control vector-treated rats (10 +/- 4) after global cerebral ischemia. Sham-operated rats displayed similar numbers of X-gal-positive neurons (HSP72 vector 18 +/- 8 vs control vector 20 +/- 7). The percentage of beta-galactosidase and Bcl-2 coexpressing neurons in HSP72-treated rats after global cerebral ischemia (84 +/- 4%) was greater than that in control vector-treated rats (58 +/- 9%). The percentage of beta-galactosidase and Bcl-2 coexpressing neurons in sham-operated rats was similar in HSP72 (93 +/- 7%) and in control vector-treated rats (88 +/- 12%). HSP72 vector transfection led to 12 times as much Bcl-2 expression as the control vector in uninjured hippocampal neuronal cultures. In injured (oxygen-glucose deprivation) hippocampal neuron cultures, HSP72 vector transfection led to 2.8 times as much Bcl-2 expression as control vector. We show that HSP72 overexpression protects cornu ammonis 1 region of the hippocampus neurons from global cerebral ischemia, and that this protection may be mediated in part by increased Bcl-2 expression."
"Inflammatory responses are associated with cardiovascular disease and may be associated with dementing disease. We evaluated the long-term prospective association between dementia and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, a nonspecific marker of inflammation. Data are from the cohort of Japanese American men who were seen in the second examination of the Honolulu Heart Program (1968-1970) and subsequently were reexamined 25 years later for dementia in the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study (1991-1996). In a random subsample of 1,050 Honolulu-Asia Aging Study cases and noncases, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentrations were measured from serum taken at the second examination; dementia was assessed in a clinical examination that included neuroimaging and neuropsychological testing and was evaluated using international criteria. Compared with men in the lowest quartile (&lt;0.34mg/L) of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, men in the upper three quartiles had a 3-fold significantly increased risk for all dementias combined, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia. For vascular dementia, the risk increased with increasing quartile. These relations were independent of cardiovascular risk factors and disease. These data support the view that inflammatory markers may reflect not only peripheral disease, but also cerebral disease mechanisms related to dementia, and that these processes are measurable long before clinical symptoms appear."
"Niemann-Pick type C disease is a neurovisceral storage disorder. Neurofibrillary tangles similar to those in Alzheimer's disease have been reported in most juvenile/adult patients without amyloid beta protein (Abeta) deposits. Recently, we found deposits of Abeta in the form of diffuse plaques in three (31- and 32-year-old sisters and a 37-year-old man) of nine Niemann-Pick type C disease patients, who presented with most severe tauopathy and with numerous neurofibrillary tangles. Abeta deposits were not detected in any of the control brains of patients younger than age 42 years. These three patients with Abeta deposit all were homozygotes of apolipoprotein E epsilon 4. Our study suggested that NPC1 gene mutations combined with homozygosity of apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 alleles could manifest neuropathology similar to that of Alzheimer's disease. Investigation of these patients may provide an important clue for understanding the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease."
We analyzed the prion protein gene (PRNP) region in patients with transmissible spongiform encephalopathy associated with the PRNP D178N mutation. The results suggest that the D178N chromosomes had independent origins in each affected pedigree or apparently sporadic case. A de novo spontaneous PRNP mutation was observed. We provide evidence that hereditary and apparently sporadic transmissible spongiform encephalopathy cases associated with the D178N mutation result from multiple recurrent mutational events.
Skin biopsies from a patient with a dissection of the left internal carotid artery and from four of his children were analyzed by electron microscopy. The index patient and three children showed mild but regular electron microscopic connective tissue aberrations. They were considered as carriers of an unknown autosomal dominant mutation. Thirty-four candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of the extracellular matrix were excluded by genetic linkage analysis as possible sites of a disease-causing mutation in this family (logarithm of odds [LOD]-score less than -2.0).
"Quantitative biomarkers of oxidative damage, such as the F(2)-isoprostanes (IsoPs) and F(4)-neuroprostanes (F(4)-NeuroPs), may be useful in assessing progression and response to therapeutics in patients with Alzheimer's disease. F(2)-IsoPs and F(4)-NeuroPs are reproducibly increased in brain and cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer's disease patients; however, results in blood and urine have been conflicting. We tested the hypothesis that F(2)-IsoPs and F(4)-NeuroPs in plasma or urine quantitatively reflect oxidative damage to the central nervous system. Our results showed that urine levels of F(2)-IsoPs or their major metabolite were not significantly different between 56 Alzheimer's disease patients and 34 controls. In addition, urine and cerebrospinal fluid F(2)-IsoP levels in 32 Alzheimer's disease patients did not correlate. Supporting these conclusions, elevated rat cerebral F(2)-IsoPs and F(4)-NeuroPs after systemic exposure to kainic acid were not associated with a significant change in their plasma or urine levels. These results show that plasma and urine F(2)-IsoPs and F(4)-NeuroPs do not accurately reflect central nervous system levels of these biomarkers and are not reproducibly elevated in body fluids outside of central nervous system in Alzheimer's disease patients. These results should guide the organization of clinical trials now being planned for patients with Alzheimer's disease."
"Cortical activation during hemiplegic gait was assessed in six nonambulatory patients with severe stroke (four men, two women; four with right and two with left hemiplegia; 57 years old and 3 months after stroke on average), using a near-infrared spectroscopic imaging system. Each patient performed tasks of treadmill walking (0.2km/hr), alternated with rest every 30 seconds for four repetitions, under partial body weight support, either with mechanical assistance in swinging the paretic leg control (CON) or with a facilitation technique that enhanced swinging of the paretic leg (FT), provided by physical therapists. Gait performance was associated with increased oxygenated hemoglobin levels in the medial primary sensorimotor cortex in the unaffected hemisphere greater than in the affected hemisphere. Both cortical mappings and quantitative data showed that the premotor activation in the affected hemisphere was enhanced during hemiplegic gait. There was also a prominent activation in the presupplementary motor area. Overall cortical activations and gait performance were greater in walking with FT than with CON. These indicate that multiple motor areas including the premotor cortex and presupplementary motor area might play important roles in restoration of gait in patients with severe stroke."
"Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome is classified into acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) and acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) by electrodiagnostic and pathological criteria. In AMAN, the immune attack appears directed against the axolemma and nodes of Ranvier. Threshold tracking was used to measure indices of axonal excitability (refractoriness, supernormality, and threshold electrotonus) for median nerve axons at the wrist of patients with AMAN (n = 10) and AIDP (n = 8). Refractoriness (the increase in threshold current during the relative refractory period) was greatly increased in AMAN patients, but the abruptness of the threshold increases at short interstimulus intervals indicated conduction failure distal to the stimulation (ie, an increased refractory period of transmission). During the 4 week period from onset, the high refractoriness returned toward normal, and the amplitude of the compound muscle action potential increased, consistent with improvement in the safety margin for impulse transmission in the distal nerve. In contrast, refractoriness was normal in AIDP, even though there was marked prolongation of distal latencies. Supernormality and threshold electrotonus were normal in both groups of patients, suggesting that, at the wrist, membrane potential was normal and pathology was relatively minor. These results support the view that the predominantly distal targets of immune attack are different for AMAN and AIDP. Possible mechanisms for the reduced safety factor in AMAN are discussed."
"Copper toxicity contributes to neuronal death in Wilson's disease and has been speculatively linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's and prion diseases. We examined copper-induced neuronal death with the goal of developing neuroprotective strategies. Copper catalyzed an increase in hydroxyl radical generation in solution, and the addition of 20 microM copper for 22 hours to murine neocortical cell cultures induced a decrease in ATP levels and neuronal death without glial death. This selective neuronal death was associated with activation of caspase-3 and was reduced by free radical scavengers and Z-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethylketone, consistent with free radical-mediated injury leading to apoptosis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is especially vulnerable to inhibition by oxygen free radicals, and the upstream metabolites, pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and 2-phosphoglycerate were elevated in cortical cells after toxic exposure to copper. One approach to protecting pyruvate dehydrogenase from oxidative attack might be to enhance binding to cofactors. Addition of thiamine, dihydrolipoic acid, or pyruvate reduced copper-induced neuronal death. To test efficacy in vivo, we added 1% thiamine to the drinking water of Long Evans Cinnamon rats, an animal model of Wilson's disease. This thiamine therapy markedly extended life span from 6.0 +/- 1.6 months to greater than 16 months."
"We conducted a systematic review to summarize the epidemiological evidence on the association between cigarette smoking, coffee drinking, and the risk of Parkinson's disease. Case-control and cohort studies that reported the relative risk of physician-confirmed Parkinson's disease by cigarette smoking or coffee drinking status were included. Study-specific log relative risks were weighted by the inverse of their variances to obtain a pooled relative risk and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Results for smoking were based on 44 case-control and 4 cohort studies, and for coffee 8 case-control and 5 cohort studies. Compared with never smokers, the relative risk of Parkinson's disease was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.54-0.63) for ever smokers, 0.80 (95% CI, 0.69-0.93) for past smokers, and 0.39 (95% CI, 0.32-0.47) for current smokers. The relative risk per 10 additional pack-years was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.81-0.88) in case-control studies and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.73-0.84) in cohort studies. Compared with non-coffee drinkers, relative risk of Parkinson's disease was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.59-0.80) for coffee drinkers. The relative risk per three additional cups of coffee per day was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.64-0.86) in case-control studies and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.46-1.00) in cohort studies. This meta-analysis shows that there is strong epidemiological evidence that smokers and coffee drinkers have a lower risk of Parkinson's disease. Further research is required on the biological mechanisms underlying this potentially protective effect."
"One form of familial progressive external ophthalmoplegia with multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions recently has been associated with mutations in POLG1, the gene encoding pol gammaA, the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase. We screened the POLG1 gene in several PEO families and identified five different heterozygous missense mutations of POLG1 in 10 autosomal dominant families. Recessive mutations were found in three families. Our data show that mutations of POLG1 are the most frequent cause of familial progressive external ophthalmoplegia associated with accumulation of multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions, accounting for approximately 45% of our family cohort."
"Intracytoplasmic inclusions composed of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) are characteristic of neurodegenerative Lewy body disorders. Using novel monoclonal antibodies raised against altered alpha-syn, we uncovered an unprecedented and extensive burden of alpha-syn pathology in the striatum of Lewy body disorders. The highest density of striatal pathology was observed in patients with a combination of Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies or pure dementia with Lewy bodies, and these alpha-syn aggregates may contribute to the parkinsonism seen in these disorders."
"Autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy previously has been linked to chromosome 10q22-q24, and recently mutations in the LGI1 gene (Leucine-rich gene, Glioma Inactivated) have been found in some autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy families. We have now identified a missense mutation affecting a conserved cysteine residue in the extracellular region of the LGI1 protein. The C46R mutation is associated with autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy in a large Norwegian family showing unusual clinical features like short-lasting sensory aphasia and auditory symptoms."
"A strong familial component of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is known. The objective of this study therefore was to investigate the likely mode of inheritance of RLS. RLS patients and their first-degree relatives were investigated and classified in RLS affected and RLS nonaffected subjects. Assessments were based on direct, personal standardized diagnostic interviews. Complex segregation analysis was performed with the families stratified according to the mean age at onset of the disease within the families. Two hundred thirty-eight RLS patients, 537 first-degree relatives, and 133 spouses were interviewed. Two groups of families were stratified: mean age at onset up to 30 years of age (Group A) and older than 30 years (Group B; p &lt; 0.005). In Group A, segregation analysis strongly favored a single major gene acting autosomal dominant with a multifactorial component. Parameter estimates were 0.003 for the allele frequency, 1.0 for the penetrance, and 0.005 for the phenocopy rate. In Group B, no evidence for a major gene could be elucidated. The segregation pattern found in our families argues for an autosomal allele acting dominantly in RLS families with an early age at onset of symptoms and suggests that RLS is a causative heterogeneous disease."
"Persons affected with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) develop a wide range of neurological abnormalities including aberrant neuronal migration and seizures. In an effort to model TSC-associated central nervous system abnormalities in mice, we generated two independent lines of astrocyte-specific Tsc1 conditional knockout mice by using the Cre-LoxP system. Astrocyte-specific Tsc1-null mice exhibit electroencephalographically proven seizures after the first month of age and begin to die at 3 to 4 months. Tsc1-null mice show significant increases in astrocyte numbers throughout the brain by 3 weeks of age and abnormal neuronal organization in the hippocampus between 3 and 5 weeks. Moreover, cultured Tsc1-null astrocytes behave similar to wild-type astrocytes during log phase growth but demonstrate increased saturation density associated with reduced p27(Kip1) expression. Collectively, our results demonstrate that astrocyte-specific disruption of Tsc1 in mice provides a context-dependent growth advantage for astrocytes that results in abnormalities in neuronal organization and epilepsy."
"Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome is a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by a reduction in mitochondrial DNA copy number. The recent discovery of mutations in the deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) gene in patients with the hepatocerebral form of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome prompted us to screen 21 patients to determine the frequency of dGK mutations, further characterize the clinical spectrum, and correlate genotypes with phenotypes. We detected mutations in three patients (14%). One patient had a homozygous GATT duplication (nucleotides 763-766), and another had a homozygous GT deletion (nucleotides 609-610); both mutations lead to truncated proteins. The third patient was a compound heterozygote for two missense mutations (R142K and E227K) that affect critical residues of the protein. These mutations were associated with variable phenotypes, and their low frequencies suggests that dGK is not the only gene responsible for mitochondrial DNA depletion in liver. The patient with the missense mutations had isolated liver failure and responded well to liver transplantation, which may be a therapeutic option in selected cases."
"The mechanisms underlying the generation of febrile seizures are poorly understood. This study investigated hyperthermia-induced changes in the hippocampus, a structure implicated in febrile seizures. It was hypothesized that neuronal excitability in the hippocampus changes with increasing temperature, and that this change is different in adult as compared with immature rats. Adult and immature (15-17 days postnatal) male rats were studied under urethane anesthesia during normothermia, moderate hyperthermia (38-39.5 degrees C), and severe hyperthermia (&gt;39.5 degrees C). Paired-pulse inhibition of the orthodromically activated population spikes in the dentate gyrus and cornu ammonis 1 region of the hippocampus (CA1), two structures within the hippocampus, was measured after stimulation of the medial perforant path and Schaffer collaterals, respectively. In the adult rat, paired-pulse inhibition was increased in the dentate gyrus during moderate and severe hyperthermia but decreased in CA1 during severe hyperthermia (all p values &lt; 0.05). In the immature rat, paired-pulse inhibition was unchanged in the dentate gyrus but decreased in CA1 during moderate hyperthermia (p &lt; 0.05). We suggest that hyperthermia contributes to seizure susceptibility in the immature hippocampus by decreasing CA1 inhibition. In the adult rat, a decrease in CA1 inhibition requires a higher degree of hyperthermia, and hippocampal seizure generation is opposed by an increase in dentate gyrus inhibition."
"In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, we investigated whether statins alter cholesterol metabolites and reduce Abeta levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of 44 patients with Alzheimer's disease. Individuals were given up to 80mg simvastatin daily or placebo for 26 weeks. Overall, simvastatin did not significantly alter cerebrospinal fluid levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42. In post hoc analysis, simvastatin significantly decreased Abeta40 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. The reduction of Abeta40 correlated with the reduction of 24S-hydroxycholesterol. These changes were not observed in more severely affected patients."
"Neurally mediated syncope is the most frequent cause of syncope in patients without structural heart disease. Its most common trigger is a reduction in venous return to the heart due to excessive venous pooling in the legs. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial to investigate the efficacy of midodrine, a selective alpha-1 adrenergic agonist that decreases venous capacitance, in preventing neurally mediated syncope triggered by passive head-up tilt. Twelve patients with history of recurrent neurally mediated syncope, which was reproduced during head-up tilt, were randomized to receive a nonpressor dose of midodrine (5mg) or placebo on day 1 and the opposite on day 3. One hour after drug or placebo administration, patients underwent 60-degree head-up tilt lasting 40 minutes (unless hypotension or bradycardia developed first). In the supine position, midodrine produced no significant change in blood pressure or heart rate. The responses to head-up tilt were significantly different on the midodrine and the placebo day: on the placebo day, 67% (8/12) of the subjects suffered neurally mediated syncope, whereas only 17% (2/12) of the subjects developed neurally mediated syncope on the midodrine day (p &lt; 0.02). These results indicate that midodrine significantly improves orthostatic tolerance during head-up tilt in patients with recurrent neurally mediated syncope."
"Band heterotopia is a malformation of cortical development characterized by bands of gray matter in the white matter parallel to the surface of the neocortex. Histopathological studies have suggested that small white matter tracts pass through the heterotopia, and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown activation in the malformation. We used diffusion tractography to explore the anatomical connectivity of band heterotopia and, in particular, whether in vivo white matter tracts traverse the heterotopic gray matter. Five patients with band heterotopia and five control subjects were scanned with whole brain diffusion tensor imaging. Anisotropy maps were calculated. Using fast marching tractography, we produced maps of connectivity and tract traces from two seed points, in the splenium of the corpus callosum and the right parietal lobe. Eigenvectors were found to pass through the band heterotopia in an aligned fashion. Patterns for maps of connectivity were similar in patients and control subjects. Areas of high connectivity were found in the band heterotopia and in cortical areas on the far side of the malformation from the seed point. The tracts hence appeared to traverse or end within the band heterotopia. The results are in agreement with previous histopathological studies and indicate the structural basis of the functional connectivity and absence of focal deficits in these patients."
"Sudden death is common in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA). In its early stages, the cerebellar presentation MSA-C can be indistinguishable from idiopathic late-onset cerebellar ataxia. We studied the hypoxic ventilatory response in MSA-C and idiopathic late-onset cerebellar ataxia patients. Six patients with idiopathic late-onset cerebellar ataxia that later evolved to MSA had impaired hypoxic ventilatory response when minimal autonomic failure was still present, whereas for patients with unimpaired hypoxic ventilatory response their diagnosis remained idiopathic late-onset cerebellar ataxia. The demonstration of impaired hypoxic ventilatory response appears to be a good marker enabling earlier diagnosis of MSA in patients presenting with idiopathic late-onset cerebellar ataxia."
"Gliomatosis cerebri is a rare, diffusely growing neuroepithelial tumor characterized by extensive brain infiltration involving more than two cerebral lobes. Among 13 patients with gliomatosis cerebri (median age, 46 years), biopsies showed features of diffuse astrocytoma (n = 4), oligoastrocytoma (n = 1), anaplastic astrocytoma (n = 5), anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (n = 1), or glioblastoma (n = 2). Molecular genetic investigation showed TP53 mutations in three of seven tumors and both PTEN mutation and epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression in one tumor. Amplification of CDK4 or MDM2 or homozygous deletion of CDKN2A was not detected. Three of 10 patients receiving radiotherapy showed a partial response (one patient) or had stable disease (two patients) lasting for more than 1 year. Four of six patients treated with procarbazine, carmustine, vincristine chemotherapy demonstrated partial remission (one patient), minor response (two patients), or stable disease (one patient). Median survival time from diagnosis was 14 months (range, 4-91+ months). Infratentorial involvement was associated with shorter survival. We conclude that (1) the molecular genetic alterations in gliomatosis cerebri resemble those in diffuse astrocytomas; (2) the prognosis of gliomatosis cerebri is variable but for at least 50% of patients as poor as for glioblastoma; and (3) some patients respond to radiotherapy and/or procarbazine, carmustine, vincristine chemotherapy."
"PrP(Sc), the only identified component of the prion, is an aberrant isoform of PrP(C), a glycoprotein of unknown function. In this study, it was shown that valproic acid, a widely used antiepileptic drug, can cause an increase of several orders of magnitude in the accumulation of PrP(C) in normal neuroblastoma cells (N2a), and of both PrP isoforms in scrapie infected neuroblastoma cells (ScN2a). Although preliminary results indicate that valproic acid administration to hamsters inoculated with prions had no significant effect on disease incubation time, it is suggested that administration of valproic acid to humans at risk of developing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease should be evaluated with caution."
"Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is a mitochondrial disease caused by point mutations in mitochondrial DNA. It usually presents as severe bilateral visual loss in young adults. We report on a neurological disorder resembling Leigh syndrome, which complicated Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy in three unrelated male patients harboring mitochondrial DNA mutations at nucleotide positions 3460, 14459, and 14484, respectively. This Leigh-like encephalopathy appears to be associated with a much more severe outcome than isolated Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy."
"The WldS mouse is a unique mutant strain that demonstrates the remarkable phenotype of prolonged survival of transected axons (""slow Wallerian degeneration""). In these studies, we tested whether this neuroprotective phenotype extends to axonal degeneration seen in a progressive peripheral neuropathy. WldS and wild-type mice were intoxicated with the cancer chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel (Taxol). The severity of the resultant sensory neuropathy was compared with behavioral, physiological, and pathological measures. WldS mice were resistant to paclitaxel neuropathy by all measures, and the resistance was because of protection against axonal degeneration. These studies demonstrate for the first time that the WldS mouse is more than a slow Wallerian degeneration phenotype, emphasizing the mechanistic link between Wallerian degeneration and peripheral neuropathy. Understanding how this mutant gene confers protection against axonal degeneration will provide important clues toward prevention of axonal degeneration in several human neurological disorders."
"Multiple sclerosis patients who become pregnant experience a significant decrease in relapses that may be mediated by a shift in immune responses from T helper 1 to T helper 2. Animal models of multiple sclerosis have shown that the pregnancy hormone, estriol, can ameliorate disease and can cause an immune shift. We treated nonpregnant female multiple sclerosis patients with the pregnancy hormone estriol in an attempt to recapitulate the beneficial effect of pregnancy. As compared with pretreatment baseline, relapsing remitting patients treated with oral estriol (8 mg/day) demonstrated significant decreases in delayed type hypersensitivity responses to tetanus, interferon-gamma levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and gadolinium enhancing lesion numbers and volumes on monthly cerebral magnetic resonance images. When estriol treatment was stopped, enhancing lesions increased to pretreatment levels. When estriol treatment was reinstituted, enhancing lesions again were significantly decreased. Based on these results, a larger, placebo-controlled trial of estriol is warranted in women with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. This novel treatment strategy of using pregnancy doses of estriol in multiple sclerosis has relevance to other autoimmune diseases that also improve during pregnancy."
"The urine levels of beta-phenylethylamine, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl glycol, homovanillic acid, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were measured to clarify the neurochemical mechanism in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. beta-Phenylethylamine levels were significantly lower in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder individuals (n = 37) than in controls (n = 21). The 22 children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder were treated with methylphenidate, and they were further divided into methylphenidate responders (n = 18) and nonresponders (n = 4). beta-Phenylethylamine levels significantly increased after methylphenidate therapy in responders, whereas they did not increase in nonresponders."
"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by the expansion of an unstable CTG repeat in the DMPK gene on chromosome 19q13.3. We present two siblings with DM1 who each inherited a premutation allele, (CTG)43, stably transmitted from the mother and a full-mutation allele, either (CTG)500 or (CTG)180, derived from a paternal protomutation allele, (CTG)52. Small-pool polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the (CTG)52 repeat allele was relatively stable in somatic tissues but was highly unstable in the male germline and extremely biased toward further expansion, consistent with the high levels of anticipation observed in DM1 families. The (CTG)43 allele showed subtle somatic instability in the mother, with maximum additions of two repeats and deletions of one repeat. Conversely, in the younger affected siblings the (CTG)43 allele showed a high degree of somatic instability (approximately 70% mutation load), resulting in deletions reverting to the high end of the normal range (down to [CTG]33) and additions up to the proto-mutation range (up to [CTG]64). The difference in the somatic stability of the (CTG)43 allele between the mother and her offspring suggests that interallelic interactions or other mechanisms in trans regulate the stability of the (CTG)43 premutation allele."
"X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is a hereditary demyelinating neuropathy caused by mutations in the connexin 32 (Cx32) gene. Cx32 is widely expressed in brain and peripheral nerve, yet clinical manifestations of CMTX mainly arise from peripheral neuropathy. We have evaluated two male patients with CMTX who on separate occasions developed transient ataxia, dysarthria, and weakness within 3 days of returning from ski trips at altitudes above 8,000 feet. Magnetic resonance imaging studies in both patients showed nonenhancing, confluent, and symmetrical white matter abnormalities that were more pronounced posteriorly and that resolved over several months. Magnetic transfer images in one patient demonstrated increased magnetization transfer ratios distinct from that seen in demyelination or edema. Both patients returned to their normal baseline within 2 to 3 weeks. These cases suggest that CMTX patients are at risk for developing an acute, transient, neurological syndrome when they travel to places at high altitudes and return to sea level. Cx32 mutations may cause central nervous system dysfunction by reducing the number of functioning gap junctions between oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, making both cells more susceptible to abnormalities of intercellular exchange of ions and small molecules in situations of metabolic stress."
"Alois Alzheimer evaluated five cases of Alzheimer's disease in the early 20th century. We focused on the family of ""Johann F.,"" Alzheimer's second patient, who died in October 1910 at age 57 years, and whose brain pathology is typical of a subgroup of Alzheimer's disease, the so-called ""plaque-only type."" It was perhaps Emil Kraepelin's personal knowledge of this patient and the histological data of the other four cases that influenced Kraepelin to coin the term Alzheimer's disease. The church archive in Passau has a genealogical database drawn from sacramental registers dating from approximately 1580 to 1900. The genealogical data of the ""Johann F."" family, which comes from villages in Lower Bavaria, extends as far back as 1670. We found documentation starting around 1830 about cause of death in the church records, which shows a familial predisposition to dementia. Affected family members include the mother, maternal grandfather, maternal great-aunt, maternal great-grandfather as well as three of Johann F.'s eight siblings. The offspring (children and grandchildren) of these affected siblings also were affected by mental illness. We conclude that ""Johann F."" represents the index case of a family with a predisposition to presenile dementia with variable age of onset (30s to 60s)."
"We report a 79-year-old woman with possible Alzheimer's disease and confluent periventricular white matter hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging in whom postmortem analysis unexpectedly demonstrated no periventricular demyelination or cerebral arteriosclerosis. However, astrocytes in the periventricular white matter exhibited clasmatodendrosis, defined as cytoplasmic swelling and vacuolation of astroglia, with beading of their dendrites. This finding represents a previously unrecognized correlate of periventricular white matter hyperintensities. Ann Neurol 2002;52:378-381"
"Cerebral 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in 14 patients with microcephaly, developmental delay, seizures, and mutations of the glucose transporter Glut1 (Glut1 deficiency syndrome) showed distinct abnormalities. Within a global context of diminished cortical uptake, more severe hypometabolism was found in the mesial temporal regions and thalami, accentuating a relative signal increase in the basal ganglia. In contrast, the structure of the brain appeared preserved in patients additionally investigated by magnetic resonance imaging. This metabolic footprint was relatively constant in all patients regardless of age, seizure history, or therapies and therefore constitutes a radiological signature of the disease. The full expression of the signature in the youngest patient (aged 19 months) indicates that the state of haploinsufficiency caused by Glut1 mutation leaves a permanent footprint on the nervous system from its earlier postnatal stages of development. The potential benefit of prompt diagnosis, aided by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, and early initiation of available therapies is underscored by our results."
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord resulting in progressive paralysis and death. The pathogenic mechanism of ALS is unknown but may involve increased oxidative stress, overactivation of glutamate receptors, and apoptosis. We report abnormalities in sphingolipid and cholesterol metabolism in the spinal cords of ALS patients and in a transgenic mouse model (Cu/ZnSOD mutant mice), which manifest increased levels of sphingomyelin, ceramides, and cholesterol esters; in the Cu/ZnSOD mutant mice, these abnormalities precede the clinical phenotype. In ALS patients and Cu/Zn-SOD mutant mice, increased oxidative stress occurs in association with the lipid alterations, and exposure of cultured motor neurons to oxidative stress increases the accumulation of sphingomyelin, ceramides, and cholesterol esters. Pharmacological inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis prevents accumulation of ceramides, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol esters and protects motor neurons against death induced by oxidative and excitotoxic insults. These findings suggest a pivotal role for altered sphingolipid metabolism in the pathogenesis of ALS."
"The neuropathology of the primary dystonias is not well understood. We examined brains from identical twins with DYT1-negative, dopa-unresponsive dystonia. The twins exhibited mild developmental delays until age 12 years when they began developing rapidly progressive generalized dystonia. Genetic, metabolic, and imaging studies ruled out known causes of dystonia. Cognition was subnormal but stable until the last few years. Death occurred at ages 21 and 22 years. The brains were macroscopically unremarkable. Microscopic examination showed unusual glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoreactive astrocytes in multiple regions and iron accumulation in pallidal and nigral neurons. However, the most striking findings were 1) eosinophilic, rod-like cytoplasmic inclusions in neocortical and thalamic neurons that were actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin-immunoreactive but only rarely actin-positive; and 2) abundant eosinophilic spherical structures in the striatum that were strongly actin- and actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin-positive. Electron microscopy suggested that these structures represent degenerating neurons and processes; the accumulating filaments had the same dimensions as actin microfilaments. To our knowledge, aggregation of actin has not been reported previously as the predominant feature in any neurodegenerative disease. Thus, our findings may shed light on a novel neuropathological change associated with dystonia that may represent a new degenerative mechanism involving actin, a ubiquitous constituent of the cytoskeletal system."
"We report that a deletion of 19 base pairs (bp) in intron 3 of the proteolipid protein (PLP/DM20) gene causes a neurological disease characterized by mild developmental delay, followed by progressive decline of acquired motor and cognitive milestones. The clinical features are associated with mild delay in myelination demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging studies and with ongoing demyelination and axonal loss demonstrated by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We demonstrate that the purine-rich 19bp element regulates PLP-specific splice site selection in transient transfections of chimeric constructs into cultured oligodendrocytes. Runs of 4 and 5 Gs centered in the 19bp element are critical for efficient PLP-specific splicing. The intronic element is sequence specific in oligodendrocytes and is not a repressor of PLP-specific splicing in nonglial cells. These data support the conclusion that deletion of the 19bp purine-rich region in PLP intron 3 causes a reduction in PLP message and protein, which affects myelin stability and axonal integrity."
"Acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of the central nervous system (CNS) is associated with meningoencephalitis and other neurological syndromes and with CNS lymphomas (CNSLs). Diagnosis is based on serological studies and more recently on detection of EBV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We measured EBV DNA by quantitative PCR and EBV mRNA by RT-PCR in the CSF in patients with EBV-associated neurological disorders. EBV was identified as the cause of CNS infection in 28 patients: 14 with CNSL, 10 with encephalitis, and 4 with postinfectious neurological complications. CSF analysis showed that patients with CNSL had high EBV load (mean +/- standard error of 4.8 +/- 0.2 log(10) DNA copies/ml) and low leukocyte counts (22 +/- 7 cells/microl); encephalitis was characterized by high EBV load (4.2 +/- 0.3 log(10) DNA copies/ml) and high leukocyte counts (143 +/- 62 cells/microl); and patients with postinfectious complications showed low EBV load (3.0 +/- 0.2 log(10) DNA copies/ml) with high leukocyte counts (88 +/- 57 cells/microl). Lytic cycle EBV mRNA, a marker of viral replication, was identified in 10 CSF samples from patients with CNSL and encephalitis. These studies demonstrate the utility of quantitative CSF PCR and establish the presence of lytic cycle EBV mRNA in CSF of patients with EBV-associated neurological disease."
"We explore three questions concerning arterial hyperoxygenation and focal ischemia. (1) Does greater benefit accrue with higher levels of arterial hyperoxemia? (2) Is the net effect of continuous (intraischemic plus postischemic) oxygen therapy toxic, or beneficial to middle cerebral artery infarction? (3) In view of free radical theories of reperfusion injury, does hyperoxia isolated to the reperfusion period damage tissue? Rats subjected to transient, focal, normothermic, normoglycemic ischemia were assessed at 2 weeks' survival. Arterial hyperoxygenation from 98.9 +/- 4.0 to 312.2 +/- 48.4mm Hg during ischemia improved (p &lt; 0.05) neurological function, as did isolated reperfusion hyperoxemia, but treatment with continuous hyperoxemia both during and after ischemia yielded greatest benefit (p &lt; 0.001). Cortical infarcts constituted 6.5 +/- 1.8% of the hemisphere at normoxia, but 2.3 +/- 0.9% at hyperoxic levels (p &lt; 0.01). Hyperoxia isolated to the reperfusion period also reduced cortical necrosis, from 6.5% to 2.7 +/- 1.2%. However, continuous intraischemic and reperfusion hyperoxemia led to only 0.2 +/- 0.1% cortical necrosis (p = 0.0005). Increasing the degree of hyperoxemia did not augment the benefit. We conclude that (1) eubaric hyperoxemia improves neurological and neuropathological outcome, (2) continuous oxygen therapy offers the greatest benefit, and (3) reperfusion hyperoxemia is beneficial. The findings should allay clinical concerns regarding oxygen-induced reperfusion injury, and, by obviating hyperbaric chambers, encourage clinical trials studying arterial hyperoxemia in treating stroke."
"Short-term deep brain stimulation (DBS) recently has been shown to be efficacious in refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. We (1) evaluated long-term DBS in medial temporal lobe structures in patients with normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and (2) investigated the use of chronic DBS electrodes for the localization of the ictal onset zone before DBS. In three patients with complex partial seizures (CPSs), DBS electrodes were implanted in the amygdalohippocampal region to identify and subsequently stimulate the ictal onset zone. CPSs were compared before and after chronic DBS. Side effects were carefully monitored. DBS electrodes yielded high-quality electroencephalogram recordings showing unilateral seizure onset in medial temporal lobe structures. For all patients, unilateral amygdalohippocampal stimulation was performed. After a mean follow-up of 5 months (range, 3-6 months), all patients had a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency. In two patients, antiepileptic drugs could be tapered. None of the patients reported side effects. This open study demonstrates the feasibility of consecutive electroencephalographic recordings and DBS in medial temporal lobe structures using DBS electrodes. These results prompt further studies in a larger patient population to establish the efficacy and safety of chronic DBS as an alternative treatment for refractory temporal lobe epilepsy."
"Eight regions of the genome (PARK1-8) have been implicated in autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of early-onset Parkinson's disease. These forms constitute a few of all cases. However, except for a haplotype in six families (PARK3), no study has successfully mapped a gene or described mutations that contribute to the common late-onset Parkinson's disease. Some have even suggested that a genetic component does not exist. We cross-matched our nationwide genealogy database with a population-based list of Icelandic Parkinson's disease patients to search for families with more than one patient. We performed a genomewide scan on 117 patients and 168 of their unaffected relatives within 51 families using 781 microsatellite markers. Allele-sharing, model-independent analysis of the results showed linkage to a region on chromosome 1p32 with a logarithm of odds score of 3.9 (Z(lr) = 4.2). By increasing the information content with additional microsatellite markers in this region, we found that the logarithm of odds score increased to 4.9 (Z(lr) = 4.8). This result corresponds to an unadjusted p value of 1.0 x 10(-6) and p &lt; 0.005 after adjusting for a genomewide search. We designate this region PARK10. We therefore have successfully mapped, to genomewide significance, a susceptibility gene for late-onset Parkinson's disease using multiple families drawn across a whole population. Identification of the susceptibility gene in this region may pave the way for a better understanding of the disease process, which, in turn, may lead to improved diagnostics and therapeutics."
"Mutations in the gene for epsilon-sarcoglycan (SGCE) have been found to cause myoclonus-dystonia syndrome. We now report clinical and genetic findings in nine additional European families with myoclonus-dystonia syndrome. The clinical presentation in 24 affecteds was homogeneous with myoclonus predominantly of neck and upper limbs in 23 of them and dystonia, presenting as cervical dystonia and/or writer's cramp, in 13 cases. Six novel and one previously known heterozygous SGCE mutations were identified. SGCE deficiency seems to be the common pathogenetic mechanism in myoclonus-dystonia syndrome."
"Multiple sclerosis is still regarded primarily as a disease of the white matter. However, recent evidence suggests that there may be significant involvement of gray matter. Here, we have used magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy in vivo and histopathology postmortem to estimate thalamic neuronal loss in patients with multiple sclerosis. Our results show that neuronal loss in multiple sclerosis can be substantial (30-35% reduction). We conclude that a neurodegenerative pathology may make a major contribution to the genesis of symptoms in multiple sclerosis."
"A 20-year-old man with bilateral parasagittal occipitoparietal polymicrogyria and epilepsy, from whom normal functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalogram responses to visual stimuli were obtained, was found to have no visual perceptual deficits. This suggests that microgyric cortex can perform normal visual functions, despite its gross structural abnormalities."
"In CAG repeat diseases, affected neurons possess many cytoplasmic granules immunopositive for expanded polyglutamine stretches. Electron microscopic immunohistochemistry showed that the granules corresponded to lysosomes of primitive type. The results suggest that, in addition to the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, mutant proteins with expanded polyglutamine stretches are involved in the lysosomal pathway for protein degradation and that this processing mechanism may serve as a target for a new therapeutic approach to CAG repeat diseases."
"Paramount among issues relating to the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (also known as prion diseases) is the absence of any effective therapy. This need has been heightened by the substantial European and emerging global problem of bovine spongiform encephalopathy and consequent variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Stimulated by the recent reports of a potent antiprion effect in cell culture-based clearance assays, we studied the utility of quinacrine in a well-characterized in vivo model of mouse-adapted transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. Our results failed to show any evidence that quinacrine is effective when using the simple but objective measure of survival prolongation."
"Parkinsonian patients present an impairment of proprioceptor-guided movement that could imply abnormal processing in the frontal mesial cortex. To test this hypothesis, we compared neuronal response to joint displacement in the supplementary and presupplementary motor areas of two monkeys, before and after the progressive establishment of an 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonian syndrome. After MPTP administration, neurons were activated by the passive movement of numerous joints in various directions and no longer simply by one or two joints in one direction. This impairment of the focused selection of proprioceptive inputs, imputable to dopamine depletion, could impede motor planning and thus contribute to akinesia."
"Intractable epilepsy may be associated with widespread structural cerebral damage. We determined whether structural damage occurs to the hippocampus, cerebellum and neocortex in the first few years following a diagnosis of seizures. Sixty-eight patients over the age of 14 years with newly diagnosed seizures and 90 matched controls underwent serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans 3.5 years apart. Using quantitative analysis of serial scans, we determined changes in hippocampal volume, hippocampal T2 relaxometry and total and regional brain volumes. Thirty-four (50%) patients had recurrent unprovoked seizures between baseline and follow-up scans. One patient with pre-existing hippocampal sclerosis (HS) did not develop progressive hippocampal damage. Group analyses found no difference in change in cerebral measures between patients and controls or between patients with and without recurrent seizures. Significant quantitative changes in individuals were largely attributable to pre-existing cerebral lesions or alcohol abuse. Subtle changes detected in individuals over 3.5 years but were not related to a history of overt seizures. Our results show patients with newly diagnosed seizures are not generally at increased risk of seizure-induced structural cerebral damage as detected with MRI. Cerebral damage may occur before the onset of seizures or develop insidiously over a more prolonged period."
"Cree leukoencephalopathy is a rapidly fatal infantile autosomal recessive leukodystrophy of unknown cause observed in the native North American Cree and Chippewayan indigenous population. We found in the brain of affected individuals the typical foamy cells with the oligodendroglial phenotype described in central hypomyelination syndrome/vanishing white matter, a syndrome related to mutations in the genes encoding the five subunits of the eucaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2B. In three patients of two Cree families, we found a homozygous missense mutation resulting in a histidine substitution at arginine 195 of epsilon-eIF2B."
"MAPT, the gene encoding tau, was screened for mutations in 96 progressive supranuclear palsy subjects. A point mutation (R5L) was identified in a single progressive supranuclear palsy subject that was not in the other progressive supranuclear palsy subjects or in 96 controls. Functionally, this mutation alters the ability of tau to promote microtubule assembly. Analysis of soluble tau from different brain regions indicates that the mutation does not affect the ratio of tau isoforms synthesized. Aggregated insoluble tau from subcortical regions was predominantly four-repeat tau with no or one amino terminal insert (0N4R and 1N4R). Insoluble tau from cortical regions also contained 1N3R tau. Thus, the R5L mutation causes a progressive supranuclear palsy phenotype, presumably by a gain-of-function mechanism."
"Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV) is an autosomal recessive muscular disorder characterized by weakness of the anterior compartment of the lower limbs with onset in early adulthood and sparing of the quadricep muscles. The UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene was recently identified as the causative gene for hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM). To investigate whether DMRV and HIBM are allelic diseases, we conducted mutational analysis of the GNE gene of six Japanese DMRV pedigrees and found that all the pedigrees share a homozygous mutation (V572L) associated with a strong linkage disequilibrium, suggesting a strong founder effect in Japanese DMRV pedigrees."
A patient developed a primary position upbeat nystagmus and a left saccadic lateropulsion. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a probable cavernoma at right caudal paramedian medullary level. Anatomical correlations are discussed. Saccadic lateropulsion is attributed to olivocerebellar pathway impairment but usually is described in more rostral medullar lesions. Our case would still support this hypothesis because the lesion could have involved the olivocerebellar pathway at its very caudal level. Upbeat nystagmus could be attributed to impairment of the nucleus intercalatus and/or cell groups of the paramedian tract.
"We examined whether a herpes simplex virus vector that expresses human proenkephalin could be used to attenuate nociception in a model of bone cancer pain in mice. Osteolytic sarcoma cells were implanted into the medullary space of the right femur, followed by a subcutaneous inoculation of a replication-defective herpes simplex virus vector expressing human proenkephalin (vector SHPE) or a lacZ-expressing control vector (vector SHZ). SHPE-inoculated mice demonstrated a significant, naltrexone-reversible decrease in pain-related behavior assessed during open-field motor activity. These results suggest that gene transfer with an enkephalin-expressing vector may be used to treat pain resulting from cancer in bone."
"We investigated a French family with a new type of autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia that was excluded from all previously identified genes and loci. The patients exhibited a slowly progressive gait and limb ataxia variably associated with akinesia, rigidity, tremor, and hyporeflexia. A mild cognitive impairment also was observed in some cases. We performed a genomewide search and found significant evidence for linkage to chromosome 7p21.3-p15.1. Analysis of key recombinants and haplotype reconstruction traced this novel spinocerebellar ataxia locus to a 24cM interval flanked by D7S2464 and D7S516."
"A naturally occurring mutation of the mass1 (monogenic audiogenic seizure-susceptible) gene recently has been reported in the Frings mouse strain, which is prone to audiogenic seizures. The human orthologous gene, MASS1, was mapped to chromosome 5q14, for which we previously have reported significant evidence of linkage to febrile seizures (FEB4). We screened for MASS1 mutations in individuals from 48 families with familial febrile seizures and found 25 DNA alterations. None of nine missense polymorphic alleles was significantly associated with febrile seizures; however, a nonsense mutation (S2652X) causing a deletion of the C-terminal 126 amino acid residues was identified in one family with febrile and afebrile seizures. Our results suggest that a loss-of-function mutation in MASS1 might be responsible for the seizure phenotypes, though it is not likely that MASS1 contributed to the cause of febrile seizures in most of our families."
"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting cognitive, language, and social functioning. Although language and social communication abnormalities are characteristic, prior structural imaging studies have not examined language-related cortex in autistic and control subjects. Subjects included 16 boys with autism (aged 7-11 years), with nonverbal IQ greater than 80, and 15 age- and handedness-matched controls. Magnetic resonance brain images were segmented into gray and white matter; cerebral cortex was parcellated into 48 gyral-based divisions per hemisphere. Asymmetry was assessed a priori in language-related inferior lateral frontal and posterior superior temporal regions and assessed post hoc in all regions to determine specificity of asymmetry abnormalities. Boys with autism had significant asymmetry reversal in frontal language-related cortex: 27% larger on the right in autism and 17% larger on the left in controls. Only one additional region had significant asymmetry differences on post hoc analysis: posterior temporal fusiform gyrus (more left-sided in autism), whereas adjacent fusiform gyrus and temporooccipital inferior temporal gyrus both approached significance (more right-sided in autism). These inferior temporal regions are involved in visual face processing. In boys with autism, language and social/face processing-related regions displayed abnormal asymmetry. These structural abnormalities may relate to language and social disturbances observed in autism."
"Drugs currently used for patients with Parkinson's disease provide temporary relief of symptoms but do not halt or slow the underlying neurodegenerative disease process. Increasing evidence suggests that neurons die in Parkinson's disease by a process called apoptosis, which may be triggered by mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress. We report that two novel synthetic inhibitors of the tumor suppressor protein p53, pifithrin-alpha (PFT-alpha) and Z-1-117, are highly effective in protecting midbrain dopaminergic neurons and improving behavioral outcome in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Mice given intraperitoneal injections of PFT-alpha or Z-1-117 exhibited improved motor function, reduced damage to nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and reduced depletion of dopamine and its metabolites after exposure to the toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). MPTP caused an increase in the level of the proapoptotic protein Bax, which was prevented by giving mice PFT-alpha and Z-1-117. PFT-alpha and Z-1-117 also suppressed Bax production and apoptosis in cultured dopaminergic cells exposed to MPP(+). Our findings demonstrate a pivotal role for p53 in experimental parkinsonism and identify a novel class of synthetic p53 inhibitors with clinical potential."
"Many central nervous system conditions that cause weakness, including many strokes, injure corticospinal tract but leave motor cortex intact. Little is known about the functional properties of surviving cortical regions in this setting, in part because many studies have used probes reliant on the corticospinal tract. We hypothesized that many features of motor cortex function would be preserved when assessed independent of the stroke-affected corticospinal tract. Functional MRI was used to study 11 patients with chronic hemiplegia after unilateral stroke that spared regions of motor cortex. Activation in stroke-affected hemisphere was evaluated using 3 probes independent of affected corticospinal tract: passive finger movement, a hand-related visuomotor stimulus, and tapping by the nonstroke index finger. The site and magnitude of cortical activation were similar when comparing the stroke hemisphere to findings in 19 control subjects. Patients activated each of 8 cortical regions with similar frequency as compared to controls, generally with a smaller activation volume. In some cases, clinical measures correlated with the size or the site of stroke hemisphere activation. The results suggest that, despite stroke producing contralateral hemiplegia, surviving regions of motor cortex actively participate in the same proprioceptive, visuomotor, and bilateral movement control processes seen in control subjects."
"White matter degeneration is one of the pathological conditions of dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. Autopsy brains exhibited a reduced number of glial cells in the lesions and an involvement of oligodendrocytes in nuclear inclusion formation, which previously has been recognized only as a pathological hallmark in neurons. Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy transgenic mice showed an increased number of affected glias with increasing age and with larger expansions of CAG repeats. These findings suggest that glial cells in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy also are involved in the polyglutamine pathogenesis."
"A G to A transition at nucleotide 11778 in the ND4 subunit gene of complex I was the first point mutation in the mitochondrial genome linked to a human disease. It causes Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy, a disorder with oxidative phosphorylation deficiency. To overcome this defect, we made a synthetic ND4 subunit compatible with the ""universal"" genetic code and imported it into mitochondria by adding a mitochondrial targeting sequence. For detection we added a FLAG tag. This gene was inserted in an adeno-associated viral vector. The ND4FLAG protein was imported into the mitochondria of cybrids harboring the G11778A mutation, where it increased their survival rate threefold, under restrictive conditions that forced the cells to rely predominantly on oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP. Since assays of complex I activity were normal in G11778A cybrids we focused on changes in ATP synthesis using complex I substrates. The G11778A cybrids showed a 60% reduction in the rate of ATP synthesis. Relative to mock-transfected G11778A cybrids, complemented G11778A cybrids showed a threefold increase in ATP synthesis, to a level indistinguishable from that in cybrids containing normal mitochondrial DNA. Restoration of respiration by allotopic expression opens the door for gene therapy of Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy."
"The delivery of proteins across the blood-brain barrier is severely limited by the proteins' size and biochemical properties. Eleven-amino acid human immunodeficiency virus TAT protein is able to cross cell membranes even when coupled with larger peptides. We evaluated whether TAT-Bcl-X(L) fusion protein is protective in focal ischemia. Mice underwent 30 or 90 minutes of intraluminal middle cerebral artery thread occlusion. TAT-Bcl-X(L), TAT-beta-galactosidase, or TAT-GFP (0.6 nmol each) were applied intravenously over 10 minutes either 1 hour before or immediately after ischemia. Additional animals received no TAT protein infusions. We show that the brain tissue is progressively transduced with TAT proteins within 3 to 4 hours after intravenous delivery. We provide evidence that TAT-Bcl-X(L) treatment reduces infarct volume and neurological deficits after long ischemic insults lasting 90 minutes, when applied both before and after ischemia. After short insults, lasting only 30 minutes, TAT-Bcl-X(L) further diminishes the number of caspase-3-reactive and DNA fragmented cells and increases the number of viable neurons in the striatum. Our results indicate that TAT fusion proteins are elegant and powerful tools that might be of clinical interest for stroke treatment, because factors may be intravenously applied. Thus, fusion proteins may open fascinating perspectives for future research."
"Evidence implicating mitochondrial dysfunction in the central nervous system of patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SALS) has recently been accumulating. In contrast, data on mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle in SALS are scarce and controversial. We investigated the in situ properties of muscle mitochondria in patients with early-stage SALS and sedentary (SED) controls using the skinned fiber technique to determine whether respiration of muscle tissue is altered in early-stage SALS in comparison with SED. Musculus vastus lateralis biopsies were obtained from 7 SED group members and 14 patients with early-stage SALS (mean disease duration, 9 months). Muscle fibers were permeabilized with saponine and then skinned and placed in an oxygraphic chamber to measure basal (V(0)) and maximal (V(max)) adenosine diphosphate-stimulated respiration rates and to assess mitochondrial regulation by adenosine diphosphate. Muscle oxidative capacity, evaluated with V(max), was identical in patients in the SALS and SED groups (V(0): SALS, 1.1 +/- 0.1; SED, 0.8 +/- 0.1, micromol 0(2). min(-1). gm(-1)dw and V(max): SALS, 3.1 +/- 0.3; SED, 2.5 +/- 0.3, micromol 0(2). min(-1). gm(-1)dw). This study shows an absence of large mitochondrial damage in skeletal muscle of patients with early-stage SALS, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction in the earlier stages of SALS is almost certainly not systemic."
"Myoclonus-dystonia is a movement disorder associated with mutations in the epsilon-sarcoglycan gene (SGCE) in most families and in the DRD2 and DYT1 genes in two single families. In both of the latter families, we also found a mutation of SGCE. The molecular mechanisms through which the detected mutations may contribute to myoclonus-dystonia remain to be determined."
"Persistent dyskinesias in the absence of or with only minimal amounts of dopaminergic medication have been reported after dopamine cell implantation for Parkinson's disease. In this study, we used [(18)F]fluorodopa (FDOPA) and positron emission tomography to determine whether this complication resulted from specific alterations in dopamine function after transplantation. Caudate and putamen FDOPA uptake values in these patients (DYS+, n = 5) were compared with those obtained in a cohort of age- and disease duration-matched transplant recipients who did not develop this complication (DYS-, n = 12). PET signal for both groups was compared at baseline and at 12 and 24 months after transplantation. We found that putamen FDOPA uptake was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.005) in DYS+ transplant recipients. These increases were predominantly localized to two zones within the left putamen. In addition to the posterodorsal zone in which a prominent reduction in FDOPA uptake was present at baseline, the DYS+ group also displayed a relative increase ventrally, in which preoperative dopaminergic input was relatively preserved. Postoperative FDOPA uptake did not reach supranormal values over the 24-month follow-up period. These findings suggest that unbalanced increases in dopaminergic function can complicate the outcome of neuronal transplantation for parkinsonism."
"Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by hippocampal atrophy, hypometabolism, and decreased N-acetylaspartate, often attributed to neuron loss and gliosis. Twenty hippocampal specimens were obtained during temporal lobectomy and frozen quickly. Perchloric acid extracts of the small metabolites were analyzed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. There were no significant associations between hippocampal neuron loss and the cellular content of N-acetylaspartate, glutamate, GABA, glutamine, or aspartate. The mean metabolite content of hippocampi with less than 30% of neurons remaining was the same as those with greater than 65% of neurons surviving. Mean N-acetylaspartate levels were below those reported by in vivo studies of control subjects. The highest and the lowest glutamate concentrations were seen in specimens with the worst neuron loss. A highly significant association between hippocampal N-acetylaspartate and glutamate content was seen with weak associations between N-acetylaspartate and aspartate and glutamate and aspartate. The hippocampal content of N-acetylaspartate, glutamate, GABA, glutamine, and aspartate is altered minimally by severe neuron loss in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. The epileptic human hippocampus has increased intracellular glutamate content that may contribute to the epileptogenic nature of hippocampal sclerosis."
"Glial cytoplasmic inclusions are the pathological hallmark of multiple system atrophy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of glial cytoplasmic inclusions remain unclear. Alpha-synuclein, a major component of glial cytoplasmic inclusions, has the ability to interact with 14-3-3 proteins, which mediate several types of signal transduction pathways. To elucidate the role of these 14-3-3 proteins in patients with multiple system atrophy, we performed immunohistochemical studies on 14-3-3 in brain tissue specimens from 7 control subjects and from 15 patients with multiple system atrophy. In both control and multiple system atrophy cases, 14-3-3 immunoreactivity was observed mainly in the neuronal somata and proximal processes, as well as the nerve fibers. Even in the severely affected regions of patients with multiple system atrophy, 14-3-3 immunoreactivity generally was spared in the surviving neurons, some of which were strongly immunolabeled. In addition, numerous glial cytoplasmic inclusions were intensely immunostained, and neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions and dystrophic neurites were also immunoreactive for 14-3-3. Our results suggest that an aberrant accumulation of 14-3-3 proteins may occur in brains affected by multiple system atrophy, and that 14-3-3 proteins may be associated with the pathogenesis of multiple system atrophy."
"Although pain is experienced by many patients with diabetic neuropathy, the pathophysiology of painful diabetic neuropathy is not understood. Substantial evidence indicates that dysregulated sodium channel gene transcription contributes to hyperexcitability of dorsal root ganglion neurons, which may produce neuropathic pain after axonal transection. In this study, we examined sodium channel mRNA and protein expression in dorsal root ganglion neurons in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and tactile allodynia, using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry for sodium channels Na(v)1.1, Na(v)1.3, Na(v)1.6, Na(v)1.7, Na(v)1.8, and Na(v)1.9. Our results show that, in rats with experimental diabetes, there is a significant upregulation of mRNA for the Na(v)1.3, Na(v)1.6, and Na(v)1.9 sodium channels and a downregulation of Na(v)1.8 mRNA 1 and 8 weeks after onset of allodynia. Channel protein levels display parallel changes. Our results demonstrate dysregulated expression of the genes for sodium channels Na(v)1.3, Na(v)1.6, Na(v)1.8, and Na(v)1.9 in dorsal root ganglion neurons in experimental diabetes and suggest that misexpression of sodium channels contributes to neuropathic pain associated with diabetic neuropathy."
"Experimental studies demonstrate an alkaline shift in brain intracellular pH (pH(i)) after hypoxia-ischemia (HI). In infants with neonatal encephalopathy after HI, our aims were to assess (1) brain pH(i) during the first 2 weeks after birth in infants categorized according to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during the first 2 weeks after birth and at more than 3 months of age, and neurodevelopmental outcome at 1 year; (2) the relationship between brain pH(i) and lactate/creatine; and (3) duration of alkaline brain pH(i). Seventy-eight term infants with neonatal encephalopathy were studied using MR techniques. One hundred and fifty-one studies were performed throughout the first year including 56 studies of 50 infants during the first 2 weeks after birth. pH(i) was calculated using phosphorus-31 MR spectroscopy and lactate/creatine was measured using proton MRS. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) brain pH(i) during the first 2 weeks after birth in infants with severely abnormal versus normal MRI was 7.24 (SD, 0.17) versus 7.04 (SD, 0.05; p &lt; 0.001); in infants who subsequently developed cerebral atrophy versus those who did not: 7.23 (SD, 0.17) versus 7.06 (SD, 0.06; p &lt; 0.05); in infants who died or had a severe neurodevelopmental impairment versus normal outcome: 7.28 (SD, 0.15) versus 7.11 (SD, 0.09; p &lt; 0.05). Brain alkalosis was associated with increased brain lactate/creatine (p &lt; 0.001). pH(i) remained more alkaline in the severe outcome group up to 20 weeks after birth (p &lt; 0.05)."
"This is the first description of slowly progressive Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) without the typical lysosomal storage in bone marrow and viscera in two descendants of a group of 17th century French-Canadians. The index patient was a married 43-year-old woman with onset of dementia in her thirties, later followed by the development of ataxia and athetoid movements. Her autopsy disclosed frontal lobe atrophy, neurolysosomal storage with oligolamellar inclusion and tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles. Of the 119 family members screened, only a married 42-year-old sister displayed symptoms of a dementia. Both women displayed vertical supranuclear ophthalmoplegia; expressive aphasia; concrete, stimulus-bound, perseverative behavior; and impaired conceptualization and planning. Cultured fibroblasts showed decreased cholesterol esterification and positive filipin staining, but no mutation was detected in coding or promoter regions of the NPC1 gene using conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis and sequencing. Sequencing showed a homozygous gene mutation that is predicted to result in an amino acid substitution, V39M, in the cholesterol binding protein HE1 (NPC2). Adult-onset NPC2 with lysosomal storage virtually restricted to neurons represents a novel phenotypic and genotypic variant with diffuse cognitive impairment and focal frontal involvement described for the first time."
"Transient neonatal hyperglycinemia is clinically or biochemically indistinguishable from nonketotic hyperglycinemia at onset. In the case of transient neonatal hyperglycinemia, the elevated plasma and cerebrospinal fluid glycine levels are normalized within 2 to 8 weeks. To elucidate the pathogenesis of transient neonatal hyperglycinemia, we studied three patients by screening mutations in the genes that encode three components of the glycine cleavage system. Heterozygous mutations were identified in all of the three patients, suggesting that transient neonatal hyperglycinemia develops in some heterozygous carriers for nonketotic hyperglycinemia."
"Mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase gene (SOD-1) are reported in 20% of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases, but no definite report of a mutation in a ""truly"" sporadic case of ALS has been proved. We present the first case of a novel SOD-1 mutation in a patient with genetically proven sporadic ALS. This mutation (H80A) is believed to alter zinc ligand binding, and its functional significance correlates well with the aggressive clinical course and postmortem findings observed in this patient."
"Downbeat nystagmus is a frequent ocular motor sign in patients with lesions of the vestibulocerebellum. The upward drift in downbeat nystagmus is a combination of a gaze-evoked drift, due to an impaired vertical neural integrator, and a velocity bias. Using a three-dimensional turntable, we analyzed the influence of gravity on these two mechanisms. Patients with cerebellar downbeat nystagmus (n = 6) and healthy subjects (n = 12) were placed in various whole-body positions along the roll, pitch, and oblique vertical planes of the head. Ocular drift was monitored with scleral search coils. Although there was no gravity dependence of the vertical gaze-evoked drift, the vertical velocity bias consisted of two components: a gravity-dependent component that sinusoidally modulated as a function of body position along the pitch plane, and a gravity-independent component that was directed upward. The combination of the two components led to an overall drift that was minimal in supine and maximal in prone position. In healthy subjects, only the gravity-dependent component was present, but in a scaled-down manner. Our results suggest that the intact vestibulocerebellum minimizes an overacting otolith-ocular reflex elicited by pitch tilt and cancels an inherent upward ocular drift that is independent of gravity-modulated otolith signals."
"A 31-year-old woman had encephalopathy, growth retardation, infantilism, ataxia, deafness, lactic acidosis, and increased signals of caudate and putamen on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Muscle biochemistry showed succinate:cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex II-III) deficiency. Both clinical and biochemical abnormalities improved remarkably with coenzyme Q10 supplementation. Clinically, when taking 300mg coenzyme Q10 per day, she resumed walking, gained weight, underwent puberty, and grew 20cm between 24 and 29 years of age. Coenzyme Q10 was markedly decreased in cerebrospinal fluid, muscle, lymphoblasts, and fibroblasts, suggesting the diagnosis of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency. An older sister has similar clinical course and biochemical abnormalities. These findings suggest that coenzyme Q10 deficiency can present as adult Leigh's syndrome."
"Recovery of function after acute injury to the central nervous system may be controlled by the availability of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the cerebral cortex. Acute lesions as well as manipulation of sensory inputs can lead to rapid reorganization of the cerebral cortex, occurring within minutes to hours. Reduction of cortical inhibitory tone through a decrease in the availability of GABA has been suggested as a possible mechanism; however, the degree and temporal course of the changes in brain GABA are not known. A novel method using two-dimensional J-resolved magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that GABA levels in the human sensorimotor cortex are quickly reduced within minutes of deafferentation. This finding strongly supports the view that the release of latent corticocortical projections from tonic inhibition through decreased GABA availability is a mechanism of rapid cortical plasticity. Reduction of brain GABA can play a pivotal role in regulating the extent of rapid cortical reorganization after lesions or changes in sensory input."
"The mucopolysaccharidoses are caused by inherited deficiencies of lysosomal enzymes involved in the degradative pathway of glycosaminoglycans. Lysosomal storage leads to cellular and organ dysfunction, including mental retardation. Storage lesions are found throughout the diseased brain, but little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie brain dysfunction. In the mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis VII, we found that specific regions of the brain are vulnerable to neurodegeneration, characterized by the presence of ubiquitin inclusions, neurofilament inclusions, and reactive astrogliosis. The pathological lesions were found predominantly in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and they increased progressively with age. Treatment with a recombinant viral vector to correct the enzymatic defect quantitatively reversed the neurodegenerative lesions in targeted regions to normal levels."
"The pathogenesis of cell death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may involve glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, oxidative damage, and apoptosis. We used a transgenic mouse model of ALS to determine the effect of inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 in treating the disease. Cyclooxygenase-2, present in spinal neurons and astrocytes, catalyzes the synthesis of prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin E2 stimulates glutamate release from astrocytes, whereas cyclooxygenase-2 also plays a key role in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and free radicals. Treatment with a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, markedly inhibited production of prostaglandin E2 in the spinal cords of ALS mice. Celecoxib treatment significantly delayed the onset of weakness and weight loss and prolonged survival by 25%. Spinal cords of treated ALS mice showed significant preservation of spinal neurons and diminished astrogliosis and microglial activation. Our results suggest that cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition may benefit ALS patients."
"Alexander's disease, a leukodystrophy characterized by Rosenthal fibers (RFs) in the brain, is categorized into three subtypes: infantile, juvenile, and adult. Although most are sporadic, occasional familial Alexander's disease cases have been reported for each subtype. Hereditary adult-onset Alexander's disease shows progressive spastic paresis, bulbar or pseudobulbar palsy, palatal myoclonus symptomatologically, and prominent atrophy of the medulla oblongata and upper spinal cord on magnetic resonance imaging. Recent identification of GFAP gene mutations in the sporadic infantile- and juvenile-onset Alexander's disease prompted us to examine the GFAP gene in two Japanese hereditary adult-onset Alexander's disease brothers with autopsy in one case. Both had spastic paresis without palatal myoclonus, and magnetic resonance imaging showed marked atrophy of the medulla oblongata and cervicothoracic cord. The autopsy showed severely involved shrunken pyramids, but scarce Rosenthal fibers (RFs). Moderate numbers of Rosenthal fibers (RFs) were observed in the stratum subcallosum and hippocampal fimbria. In both cases, we found a novel missense mutation of a G-to-T transition at nucleotide 841 in the GFAP gene that results in the substitution of arginine for leucine at amino acid residue 276 (R276L). This is the first report of identification of the causative mutation of the GFAP gene for neuropathologically proven hereditary adult-onset Alexander's disease, suggesting a common molecular mechanism underlies the three Alexander's disease subtypes."
Skewing of X inactivation may contribute to the manifestation of symptoms in adrenoleukodystrophy carriers. We observed highly skewed X inactivation in 32% of 22 symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers but not in 7 related and 35 unrelated controls. Skewing of X inactivation correlated with clinical neurological scores but not with the extent of very long-chain fatty acid accumulation. Transcript analysis in cultured fibroblasts revealed that skewing could occur both in favor of the mutant and the wild-type allele. Adrenoleukodystrophy carriers are more susceptible to develop skewing of X inactivation in favor of the mutant allele being associated with the manifestation of symptoms.
"We quantified vitamin A in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, elevated intracranial pressure of other causes and normal intracranial pressure. Vitamin A could be detected by high-pressure liquid chromatography in most of the specimens. There was a significantly higher level of vitamin A in the cerebrospinal fluid of some patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Vitamin A toxicity may play a role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension."
"Although animal models have demonstrated that late secondary cerebral injury after arterial occlusion and subsequent recanalization may limit the benefit of reperfusion therapy, this phenomenon has not been well characterized in humans. Diffusion-perfusion magnetic resonance imaging studies were performed before treatment, early after treatment, and at day 7 in patients undergoing vessel recanalization with intraarterial thrombolytics. Among 18 patients studied, mean age was 71 (range, 27-94), and median entry National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 13 (range, 6-25). Early after recanalization, partial or complete normalization of diffusion imaging abnormalities occurred in 8 of 18 (44%) patients. Among the eight patients with early diffusion imaging reversal, late secondary injury by day 7 occurred in 5 (63%), and sustained normalization of all reversed tissue occurred in 3 (38%). Pretreatment apparent diffusion coefficient values were lowest in regions experiencing no reversal (mean apparent diffusion coefficient, 608 microm(2)/sec), intermediate in regions with reversal and secondary decline (617 microm(2)/sec), and highest in regions with sustained reversal (663 microm(2)/sec). There was a trend toward less improvement in neurological deficit in patients with secondary injury versus patients with sustained reversal. In the future, late secondary tissue injury may become an important therapeutic target for postreperfusion neuroprotective therapies, with treatment efficacy monitored by serial diffusion magnetic resonance imaging."
"Diet may play a causative role in Parkinson's disease (PD), but potential associations between diet and PD risk rarely have been assessed in prospective studies. We investigated associations between food intakes and PD risk in two large prospective cohorts in which 210 incident PD cases in men and 184 in women were documented. A positive association was found between dairy intake and PD risk in men (relative risk [RR] comparing extreme categories, 1.8; p trend = 0.004), but not in women (RR, 1.1; p trend = 0.9). No other food groups were associated with PD risk in either men or women. Further analyses among men showed significant positive associations with PD risk for intakes of several dairy foods as well as dairy calcium (RR, 1.5; p trend = 0.02), dairy vitamin D (RR, 1.6; p trend = 0.004), dairy protein (RR, 1.6; p trend = 0.01), and lactose (RR, 1.8; p trend = 0.002), but not dairy fat (RR, 1.1; p trend = 0.4). Intakes of calcium, vitamin D, and protein from other dietary or supplemental sources were not related to PD risk in men. Our results suggest that higher intake of dairy products may increase the risk of PD in men; however, this finding needs further evaluation, and the underlying active components need to be identified."
"We present a juvenile case of Alexander's disease with atypical focal magnetic resonance imaging-detected lesions and elevated levels of lactate in cerebrospinal fluid. The diagnosis was based on the neuropathological finding of a diffuse accumulation of Rosenthal fibers within the brain and the spinal cord. The diagnosis was confirmed by detection of a mutation in exon 1 at nucleotide position 249 of glial fibrillary acidic protein cDNA, a finding previously reported in cases of infantile Alexander's disease."
"In the autopsy studies of patients with delayed ischemic neurological deficits after subarachnoid hemorrhage, a predominance of cortical lesions has been observed. Similar to the autopsy descriptions in the literature, we present magnetic resonance images visualizing focal laminar cortical lesions around a fissure or sulcus in two patients, who initially did not undergo surgery, with delayed ischemic neurological deficits. This magnetic resonance imaging pattern may provide a clue to the diagnosis if the patient does not present to the emergency room with the acute hemorrhage but with delayed ischemic neurological deficits."
"Recently, a single nucleotide polymorphism that results in an amino acid change (Q7R) was identified in a previously undescribed gene, named saitohin, nested within the tau gene. We analyzed the distribution of this polymorphism in 499 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 91 patients with frontotemporal dementia, and 402 controls. This polymorphism was in complete disequilibrium with the well-defined extended tau haplotype. We failed to replicate the association between the RR genotype and late-onset Alzheimer's disease, but we found a trend toward an association between the QQ genotype and frontotemporal dementia. Thus, the saitohin Q allele, which is a novel determinant of the tau H1 haplotypes, might represent a causative factor involved in the determinism of several tauopathies."
"Myostatin, a transforming growth factor-beta family member, is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. To explore the therapeutic potential of targeting myostatin in settings of muscle degeneration, we crossed myostatin null mutant mice with mdx mice, a model for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. Mdx mice lacking myostatin were stronger and more muscular than their mdx counterparts. Diaphragm muscle showed less fibrosis and fatty remodeling, suggesting improved muscle regeneration."
"Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) is a behaviorally focal dementia syndrome with deterioration of language functions but relative preservation of other cognitive domains for at least the first two years of disease. In this study, PPA patients with impaired word finding but intact comprehension of conversational speech and their matched control subjects were examined using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). fMRI compared signal changes during phonological and semantic language tasks with those during a control task (matching letters). PPA patients showed longer reaction times and reduced accuracy versus controls on the language tasks, but no performance differences on the control task. VBM demonstrated reduced gray matter in left superior temporal and inferior parietal regions in the PPA group. However, these patients showed a normal pattern of activation within the classical language regions. In addition, PPA patients showed activations, not seen in normals, in fusiform gyrus, precentral gyrus, and intra-parietal sulcus. These activations were found to correlate negatively with measures of naming and task performance. The additional activations in PPA may therefore represent a compensatory spread of language-related neural activity or a failure to suppress activity in areas normally inhibited during language tasks."
"The aim of this study was to clarify whether autoimmunity against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) in the cerebellum was associated with the pathogenesis of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). We used human autopsy cerebellar tissues from three PCD-LEMS patients and six other disease patients including one with LEMS as the controls. We compared cerebellar P/Q-type VGCC in these patients and controls for the amount and ratio of autoantibody-channel complex using an 125I-omega-conotoxin MVIIC-binding assay with Scatchard analysis, and their distribution using autoradiography. The quantity of cerebellar P/Q-type VGCC measured by Scatchard analysis were reduced in PCD-LEMS patients (63.0 +/- 7.0 fmol/mg, n = 3), compared with the controls (297.8 +/- 38.9 fmol/mg, n = 6). The ratio of autoantibody-VGCC complexes to total P/Q-type VGCCs measured by immunoprecipitation assay were increased in PCD-LEMS patients. We analysed cerebellar specimens by autoradiography using (125)I-omega-conotoxin MVIIC, which specifically binds to P/Q-type VGCCs. In PCD-LEMS cerebellum, the toxin binding sites of P/Q-type VGCCs were markedly reduced compared with controls, especially in the molecular layer, which is the richest area of P/Q-type VGCCs in the normal cerebellum. This suggests that P/Q-type VGCCs of the cerebellar molecular layer is the immunological target in developing PCD-LEMS."
"The persistence of neurogenesis in the forebrain subventricular zone (SVZ) of adult mammals suggests that the mature brain maintains the potential for neuronal replacement after injury. We examined whether focal ischemic injury in adult rat would increase SVZ neurogenesis and direct migration and neuronal differentiation of endogenous precursors in damaged regions. Focal stroke was induced in adult rats by 90-minute right middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Cell proliferation and neurogenesis were assessed with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling and immunostaining for cell type-specific markers. Brains examined 10-21 days after stroke showed markedly increased SVZ neurogenesis and chains of neuroblasts extending from the SVZ to the peri-infarct striatum. Many BrdU-labeled cells persisted in the striatum and cortex adjacent to infarcts, but at 35 days after tMCAO only BrdU-labeled cells in the neostriatum expressed neuronal markers. Newly generated cells in the injured neostriatum expressed markers of medium spiny neurons, which characterize most neostriatal neurons lost after tMCAO. These findings indicate that focal ischemic injury increases SVZ neurogenesis and directs neuroblast migration to sites of damage. Moreover, neuroblasts in the injured neostriatum appear to differentiate into a region-appropriate phenotype, which suggests that the mature brain is capable of replacing some neurons lost after ischemic injury."
"This study investigated the neural substrates of preserved visual functioning in a patient with homonymous hemianopsia and Riddoch syndrome after a posterior cerebral artery stroke affecting the primary visual cortex (area V1). The limited visual abilities of this patient included above-chance verbal reports of movement and color change as well as discrimination of movement direction in the hemianopic field. Functional magnetic resonance imaging showed that motion and color-change stimuli presented to the hemianopic field produced activation in several extrastriate areas of the lesioned hemisphere that were defined using retinotopic mapping. Magnetoencephalographic recordings indicated that evoked activity occurred earlier in the higher-tier visual areas V4/V8 and V5 than in the lower-tier areas V2/V3 adjacent to the lesion. In addition, the functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis showed an increased functional connectivity between areas V4/V8 and V5 of the lesioned hemisphere in comparison with the same areas in the intact hemisphere during the presentation of color changes. These results suggest that visual perception after the V1 lesion in Riddoch syndrome is mediated by subcortical pathways that bypass V1 and project first to higher-tier visual areas V5 and V4/V8 and subsequently to lower-tier areas V2/V3."
"Inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN and overexpression of VEGF are two of the most common events observed in high-grade malignant gliomas. The purpose of this study was to determine whether PTEN controls VEGF expression in gliomas under normoxic conditions. Transfer of PTEN to human glioma cells resulted in the transduction of a functional PTEN protein as evidenced by the upregulation of p27 and modification of the phosphorylation status of Akt. Under normoxic conditions, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Northern blot analyses showed downregulation of VEGF in PTEN-treated cells. Moreover, conditioned media from PTEN-treated glioma cells significantly diminished the ability of endothelial cells to grow and migrate. Western blot assays demonstrated that, in a normoxic environment, PTEN downregulates HIF-1 alpha. Finally, promoter activity assays showed that the VEGF promoter region containing the HIF-1alpha binding site is necessary and sufficient for PTEN-mediated downregulation of VEGF. Experiments with PI3-K inhibitors and kinase assays suggested that PI3-K is mediating the effect of PTEN on VEGF, and not the p42/p48 or p38 MAP kinases. These results indicate that restoration of PTEN function in gliomas may induce therapeutic effect by downregulating VEGF. Furthermore, this close functional relationship between PTEN and VEGF suggests that a better understanding of the transduction signal regulated by PTEN might enhance the knowledge of the cause and physiology of vascular and inflammatory diseases."
"Long-term deficits in cognitive function are the principal effects of lead (Pb2+) exposure in children and can be modeled in experimental animals. Current therapeutic approaches in the treatment of childhood Pb2+ intoxication are not effective in reversing learning deficits once they have occurred. We report that environmental enrichment reverses long-term deficits in spatial learning produced by developmental Pb2+ exposure in rats. Enhanced learning performance of Pb2+-exposed animals reared in an enriched environment was associated with recovery of deficits in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 1 (NR1) mRNA and induction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA in the hippocampus. The effect of environmental enrichment on NR1 and BDNF gene expression was specific to Pb2+-exposed animals and was present in the absence of changes in the NR2B subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, GluR1, alpha CamKII, or PSD-95 gene expression measured in the same animals. Our findings demonstrate that the learning impairments and NR1 subunit mRNA deficits resulting from developmental Pb2+ exposure are reversible if the animals are provided with an enriched environment even after the exposure has occurred. We propose environmental enrichment as a basis for the treatment of childhood Pb2+ intoxication."
"Patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) who do not respond to conventional immunotherapeutic agents, or cannot tolerate their side effects, are considered ""refractory."" Ablation of the immune system followed by bone marrow transplant has been shown to cure experimental MG in rats. It is now known that immunoablative treatment with high-dose cyclophosphamide does not damage hematopoietic ""stem cells,"" permitting repopulation of the immune system without bone marrow transplant. Recent evidence indicates that this treatment can induce durable remissions in autoimmune diseases. We treated three myasthenic patients, for whom treatment with thymectomy, plasmapheresis, and conventional immunotherapeutic agents failed, by using high-dose cyclophosphamide (50mg/kg/day intravenously for 4 days) followed by granulocyte colony stimulating factor. All three patients tolerated the treatment well and have had marked improvement in myasthenic weakness, permitting reduction of immunosuppressive medication to minimal levels. Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody levels decreased in two AChR antibody-positive patients, and anti-MuSK antibody levels decreased in one ""AChR antibody-negative"" patient. The patients have been followed for up to 3.5 years, with no recurrence of symptoms. High-dose cyclophosphamide treatment appears to be an effective and safe treatment for selected patients with refractory MG. Further follow-up of these and additional patients will be needed to determine whether the benefit is durable."
"Antiretroviral toxic neuropathy is the most common neurological complication of human immunodeficiency virus infection. This painful neuropathy not only affects the quality of life of human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients but also severely limits viral suppression strategies. We have developed an in vitro model of this toxic neuropathy to better understand the mechanism of neurotoxicity and to test potential neuroprotective compounds. We show that among the dideoxynucleosides, ddC appears to be the most neurotoxic, followed by ddI and then d4T. This reflects their potency in causing neuropathy. AZT, which does not cause a peripheral neuropathy in patients, does not cause significant neurotoxicity in our model. Furthermore, in this model, we show that the immunophilin ligand FK506 but not cyclosporin A prevents the development of neurotoxicity by ddC, as judged by amelioration of ddC-induced ""neuritic pruning,"" neuronal mitochondrial depolarization, and neuronal necrotic death. This finding suggests a calcineurin-independent mechanism of neuroprotection. As calcineurin inhibition underlies the immunosuppressive properties of these clinically used immunophilin ligands, this holds promise for the neuroprotective efficacy of nonimmunosuppressive analogs of FK506 in the prevention or treatment of antiretroviral toxic neuropathy."
"Hypothermia is potentially therapeutic in the management of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. However, not all studies have shown a neuroprotective effect. It is suggested that the stress of unsedated hypothermia may interfere with neuroprotection. We propose that selective head cooling (SHC) combined with mild total-body hypothermia during anesthesia enhances local neuroprotection while minimizing the occurrence of systemic side effects and stress associated with unsedated whole-body cooling. Our objective was to determine whether SHC combined with mild total-body hypothermia while anesthetized for a period of 24 hours reduces cerebral damage in our piglet survival model of global hypoxia-ischemia. Eighteen anesthetized piglets received a 45-minute global hypoxic-ischemic insult. The pigs were randomized either to remain normothermic or to receive SHC. We found that the severity of the hypoxic-ischemic insult was similar in the SHC versus the normothermic group, and that the mean neurology scores at 30 and 48 hours and neuropathology scores were significantly better in the SHC group versus the normothermic group. We conclude that selective head cooling combined with mild systemic hypothermia and anesthesia is neuroprotective when started immediately after the insult in our piglet model of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy."
"The first electrophysiological study of the human lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), optic radiation, striate, and extrastriate visual areas is presented in the context of presurgical evaluation of three epileptic patients (Patients 1, 2, and 3). Visual-evoked potentials to pattern reversal and face presentation were recorded with depth intracranial electrodes implanted stereotactically. For Patient 1, electrode anatomical registration, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and electrophysiological responses confirmed the location of two contacts in the geniculate body and one in the optic radiation. The first responses peaked approximately 40 milliseconds in the LGN in Patient 1 and 60 milliseconds in the V1/V2 complex in Patients 2 and 3. Moreover, steady state visual-evoked potentials evoked by the unperceived but commonly experienced video-screen flicker were recorded in the LGN, optic radiation, and V1/V2 visual areas. This study provides topographic and temporal propagation characteristics of steady state visual-evoked potentials along human visual pathways. We discuss the possible relationship between the oscillating signal recorded in subcortical and cortical areas and the electroencephalogram abnormalities observed in patients suffering from photosensitive epilepsy, particularly video-game epilepsy. The consequences of high temporal frequency visual stimuli delivered by ubiquitous video screens on epilepsy, headaches, and eyestrain must be considered."
"A unique phenotype of Waardenburg-Hirschsprung disease (WS4) accompanied by peripheral neuropathy and central dysmyelination has been recognized recently in association with SOX10 mutations. We report an infant boy with lethal congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy and WS4 who had a heterozygous SOX10 mutation (Q250X). Histopathological studies showed an absence of peripheral nerve myelin despite normal numbers of Schwann cells and profound dysmyelination in the central nervous system. These observations suggest that some SOX10 mutations such as Q250X may allow Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes to proliferate but interfere with further differentiation to form myelin. In contrast with the SOX10 loss-of-function mutations causing only WS4, mutations associated with both peripheral and central dysmyelination may affect pathology through a dominant-negative mechanism."
"Oligoastrocytomas are mixed gliomas harboring different genetic alterations and with heterogeneous clinical evolution. We have looked for correlations between genetic losses and clinical evolution in 34 oligoastrocytomas. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) with different microsatellite markers was studied on chromosomes 1p, 10q, 17p, and 19q. LOH on 1p was found in 44% of the tumors, on 10q in 24%, on 17p in 18%, and on 19q in 38%. LOH on 1p and 19q was combined in 29% of the patients. LOH on 1p was associated with significantly longer overall survival (p = 0.0092) and LOH on 10q with shorter overall survival (p = 0.0206). The observation that LOH on 10q predicts a short survival in oligoastrocytomas is novel and provides further evidence that genetic analysis may help to predict the clinical evolution of different gliomas, giving a more rationale basis to therapeutic options."
"Carbamylphosphate synthase is the first enzymatic reaction of the urea cycle. Its activator, N-acetylglutamate, is synthesized from acetyl-CoA and glutamate in a reaction catalyzed by N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS). We have identified the putative human NAGS gene and report the first mutation in this gene in a family with carbamylglutamate responsive hyperammonemia and normal activity of the urea cycle enzymes. Mutation analysis has a higher diagnostic specificity than the enzymatic assay in NAGS deficiency. A therapeutic trial with carbamylglutamate is recommended whenever hyperammonemia without an organic aciduria, increased orotate excretion, or diagnostic amino acidemia/uria is detected."
"The development of additional acute stroke therapies to complement and supplement intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator within the first 3 hours after stroke onset remains an important and pressing need. Much has been learned about the presumed target of acute stroke therapy, the ischemic penumbra, and clinically available imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography hold great promise for at least partially identifying this region of potentially salvageable ischemic tissue. Understanding the biology of ischemia-related cell injury has also evolved rapidly. New treatment approaches to improve outcome after focal brain ischemia will likely be derived by looking at naturally occurring adaptive mechanisms such as those related to ischemic preconditioning and hibernation. Many clinical trials previously performed with a variety of neuroprotective and thrombolytic drugs provide many lessons that will help to guide future acute stroke therapy trials and enhance the likelihood of success in future trials. Combining knowledge from these three areas provides optimism that additional acute stroke therapies can be developed to maximize beneficial functional outcome in the greatest proportion of acute stroke patients possible."
"In adult diabetic patients, periods of hyperglycemia may be associated with exacerbation of focal seizures. Our objective was to determine in the adult rats the correlation between seizure susceptibility and extracellular glucose concentration in two models of seizures. Male rats were injected with two doses of streptozocin (40 mg/kg IP) on 2 consecutive days to induce diabetic hyperglycemia. Controls either received vehicle or were not injected. After 2 weeks, blood glucose concentration was measured, and the rats were subjected to flurothyl seizure test. Another group of rats received glucose solution (20%, 5 ml IP) 30 minutes before testing to induce nondiabetic hyperglycemia. Thresholds for flurothyl-induced clonic and tonic-clonic seizures were determined. Finally, in vitro epileptiform activity was induced in the entorhinal cortex-hippocampal slices from naive rats by perfusing with magnesium-free medium with various glucose concentrations. In additional slices, paired-pulse paradigm was determined in the perforant path. Susceptibility to clonic and tonic-clonic flurothyl-induced seizures positively correlated with blood glucose concentrations as the increased glucose concentration was associated with proconvulsant effects. Similarly, in the in vitro experiments, epileptiform activity was promoted by increased and suppressed by decreased glucose concentrations. Data indicate that, in the adult rats, high glucose concentrations are associated with proconvulsant effects."
"Motor deficits affect patients with Alzheimer's disease only at later stages. Recent studies demonstrate that the primary motor cortex is affected by neuronal degeneration accompanied by the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. It is conceivable that neuronal loss is compensated by reorganization of the neural circuitries occurring along the natural course of the disease, thereby maintaining motor performances in daily living. Cortical motor output to upper limbs was tested via motor-evoked potentials from forearm and hand muscles elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation of motor cortex in 16 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease without motor deficits. Motor cortex excitability was increased, and the center of gravity of motor cortical output, as represented by excitable scalp sites, showed a frontal and medial shift, without correlated changes in the site of maximal excitability (hot-spot). This may indicate functional reorganization, possibly after the neuronal loss in motor areas. Hyperexcitability might be caused by a dysregulation of the intracortical GABAergic inhibitory circuitries and selective alteration of glutamatergic neurotransmission. Such findings suggest that motor cortex hyperexcitability and reorganization allows prolonged preservation of motor function during the clinical course of Alzheimer's disease."
"PARK6, a locus for early-onset recessive parkinsonism, has been causally implicated in nine unrelated families from four different countries. The gene is still unidentified and hence the importance of PARK6 as a cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown. To date, no pathology or functional imaging studies are available on PARK6-linked parkinsonism. We have used (18)F-dopa positron emission tomography to study four patients who are homozygous and three asymptomatic relatives who are heterozygous for PARK6. The clinically affected PARK6 subjects had a similar 85% reduction in posterior dorsal putamen (18)F-dopa uptake to a group of idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients matched for clinical disease severity and duration but showed significantly greater involvement of head of caudate and anterior putamen. The group of asymptomatic PARK6 carriers showed a significant mean 20 to 30% reduction in caudate and putamen (18)F-dopa uptake in comparison with controls, individual values falling toward the bottom of the normal range. Our results indicate that PARK6 pathology results in a more uniform loss of striatal dopamine terminal function than Parkinson's disease. The subclinical loss of striatal dopamine storage capacity found in the PARK6 carriers implies that the unidentified gene on the short arm of chromosome 1 exhibits either haploinsufficency or a dominant negative effect."
"The DYT1 dystonia mutation is associated with an abnormal metabolic brain network characterized by hypermetabolism of the basal ganglia, supplementary motor area, and the cerebellum. In this study, we quantified the activity of this network in carriers of other dystonia mutations to determine whether this functional abnormality is linked to genotype. The findings suggest that the DYT1 metabolic topography is not genotype specific and may be present in carriers of other dystonia mutations."
"Friedreich's ataxia is a neurodegenerative disease frequently associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We have determined mitochondrial ATP, phosphocreatine, and intracellular inorganic phosphate levels by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the heart of 11 Friedreich's ataxia patients and 11 healthy controls. For the first time, to our knowledge, we showed a significant correlation between the extent of myocardial energy deficiency and the degree of myocardial hypertrophy. When combining our results with previous works on Friedreich's ataxia, these novel findings suggest that energy metabolism is most likely the cause and hypertrophy the effect in Friedreich's ataxia."
"We present data on the known risk factors encountered in children presenting with a first arterial ischemic stroke to a single tertiary center over 22 years. Two hundred twelve patients (54% male; median age, 5 years) were identified. One hundred fifteen (54%) were previously healthy. Cerebral arterial imaging was undertaken in 185 patients (87%) and was abnormal in 79%. Of 104 previously healthy patients investigated with echocardiography, only 8 had abnormal studies. Genetic or acquired conditions causing thrombophilia were rare. Forty percent of patients were anemic, and 21% either had elevated total plasma homocysteine or were homozygous for the t-MTHFR mutation. Trauma and previous varicella zoster infection were significantly more common in the previously healthy group. There was a significant association between cerebral arterial abnormalities and systolic blood pressure greater than 90th percentile and a trend for an association with varicella within the previous year. Clinical history and examination usually identify underlying risk factors and precipitating triggers for arterial ischemic stroke in childhood. Cerebral arterial imaging is usually abnormal, but echocardiography and prothrombotic screening are commonly negative."
"Regional and global cerebral atrophy are inevitable features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We assessed volumes and atrophy rates of brain structures in patients with familial AD during the period that they developed symptoms. Five patients with presymptomatic AD and 20 controls had two or more annual volumetric MRI brain scans. Volumes of brain, ventricles, temporal lobes, hippocampi, and entorhinal cortices (ECs) were measured. Rates of volume change were calculated from serial scans. There were no significant differences in baseline measures of whole brain, temporal lobe, or ventricular volume between patients and controls; averaged volumes of medial temporal lobe structures (both hippocampi and ECs) were 16.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3-28.0%) lower in patients. Atrophy rates for brain, temporal lobe, hippocampus, and EC were significantly increased in patients compared with controls (p &lt; 0.05). Averaged atrophy rates from both hippocampi and ECs were 5.1% (95% CI, 3.0-7.1%) greater in patients than controls. Linear extrapolation backward suggested medial temporal lobe atrophy commenced 3.5 years (95% CI, 0.7-7.5 years) before onset, when all patients were asymptomatic. We conclude that increased medial temporal lobe atrophy rates are an early and distinguishing feature of AD and that pathological atrophy probably is occurring several years before the onset of symptoms."
"Viral infections are though to play an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) potentially through molecular mimicry. An identical sequence was found in both myelin basic protein (MBP, residues 96-102), a candidate autoantigen for MS, and human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6 U24, residues 4-10) that is a suspected viral agent associated with MS. In this study, we showed that greater than 50% of T cells recognizing MBP(93-105) cross-reacted with and could be activated by a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 1 to 13 of HHV-6 U24 in MS patients. The estimated precursor frequency of these cross-reactive T cells recognizing both peptides, MBP(93-105) and HHV-6 (U24)(1-13), was significantly elevated in MS patients compared with that in healthy controls. These cross-reactive CD4+ T cells represented the same Th1 phenotype as that of monospecific T cells recognizing MBP(93-105). There were increased antibody titers for both peptide HHV-6 (U24)(1-13) and peptide MBP(93-105) in the same patients with MS compared with those in healthy controls, suggesting B-cell sensitization to the antigens in MS patients. The study provides important evidence in the understanding of the potential role of HHV-6 infection/reactivation in the activation of autoimmune reactivity to MBP and its implication in the pathogenesis of MS."
"Optic nerve degeneration is a feature common to diseases with mutations in genes that encode complex I of the respiratory chain. Vulnerability of this central nervous system tract is a mystery, because of the paucity of animal models used to investigate effects of the mutated DNA in tissues rather than isolated in cultured cells. Using a ribozyme designed to degrade the mRNA encoding a critical nuclear-encoded subunit gene of complex I (NDUFA1), we tested whether oxidative phosphorylation deficiency can recapitulate the optic neuropathy of mitochondrial disease. Injection of adenoassociated virus expressing this ribozyme led to axonal destruction and demyelination, the hallmarks of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy."
"The degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons in early Parkinson's disease (PD) is compensated in part by increased transmitter turnover in surviving neurons of the pathway. In this (18)F-dopa positron emission tomography study, we demonstrate compensatory changes in PD in another midbrain dopamine projection to the basal ganglia, the nigropallidal projection to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi). Increased (18)F-dopa uptake in the GPi is seen in early PD which then is lost in advanced PD. Our early PD cases show an absence of significant clinical progression in the face of a continuing loss of nigrostriatal projections. This indicates a compensatory neuronal plasticity that we now show to involve the nigropallidal dopamine pathway to the GPi but not to the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe). Enhanced function of the dopamine projection to the GPi serves, we propose, to maintain a more normal pattern of pallidal output to ventral thalamus and motor cortex in early PD, whereas loss of this adaptive pathway in advanced disease may be a pivotal step in the progression of the disease."
"The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of obtaining magnetic resonance-measured cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen utilization (MR-CMRO(2)) in acute ischemic stroke patients. Seven stroke patients were serially imaged: 4.5 +/- 0.9 hours (tp1), 3 to 5 days (tp2), and 1 to 3 months (tp3) after symptom onset. Diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and multiecho gradient-echo/spin-echo images were acquired; cerebral blood flow and oxygen extraction fraction maps were obtained from which CMRO(2) was calculated as the product of cerebral blood flow and oxygen extraction fraction. The final infarct lesions obtained from tp3 T2-weighted images and the ""penumbra"" obtained from the tp1 perfusion-weighted image-defined lesion were coregistered onto tp1 CMRO(2) maps. CMRO(2) values in the region of brain that eventually infarcted were reduced to 0.40 +/- 0.24 of the respective region on the contralateral hemisphere. The ""salvaged penumbra"" defined by the area of mismatch between the final infarct and the tp1 perfusion-weighted lesion demonstrated an average CMRO(2) value of 0.55 +/- 0.11 of the contralateral hemisphere. Although our results are preliminary and require further evaluation, the ability to obtain in vivo measurements of MR-CMRO(2) noninvasively potentially can provide information for determining brain tissue viability in acute ischemic stroke patients."
"Probing a cerebellar expression library with TrAb sera from patients with Hodgkin's disease and paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration resulted in the isolation of MAZ (myc-associated zinc-finger protein). Eleven of 19 TrAb sera and 16 of 131 controls reacted with MAZ, indicating a significant, although not specific, association between Tr and MAZ immunities (p &lt; 0.001). Interestingly, 9 of 16 positive control patients also had cerebellar dysfunction. Purified MAZ antibodies reacted with Purkinje cells. In neuronal cells, MAZ interacts with DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer product), the receptor for netrin-1, a neuronal survival factor. These findings suggest epitope spreading between the Tr antigen and the MAZ-DCC complex and offer a possible model of immune-mediated cerebellar disease."
"We identified two novel heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA point mutations in the gene encoding the ND5 subunit of complex I: a 12770A--&gt;G transition identified in a patient with MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) and a 13045A--&gt;C transversion in a patient with a MELAS/Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy/Leigh's overlap syndrome. Biochemical analysis of muscle homogenates showed normal or very mildly reduced complex I activity. Histochemistry was normal. Our observations add to the evidence that mitochondrial ND5 protein coding gene mutations frequently associate with the MELAS phenotype, and it highlights the role of complex I dysfunction in MELAS."
"Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with an increased risk of vascular disease, and recent results suggest that it also could increase the risk of dementia. We examined the relationship between homocysteine and cognitive decline in 1,241 subjects aged 61 to 73 years, followed up over 4 years. Plasma homocysteine levels were determined in all participants as well as cardiovascular risk factors, apolipoprotein E genotype, plasma levels of folate, and vitamin B12. Cognitive performances were assessed repeatedly by using Mini-Mental State Examination, Trail Making Test, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, and Finger Tapping Test. At 2-year follow-up, 841 subjects underwent cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, and white matter hyperintensities were rated visually. Analyses were adjusted for all cardiovascular risk factors. Cross-sectional analyses showed that higher concentrations of homocysteine were significantly related to poorer performances at all neuropsychological tests. Longitudinal analyses confirmed this finding. The odds of cognitive decline was 2.8-fold (p &lt; 0.05) higher in subjects with homocysteine levels above 15 micromol/L compared with those with homocysteine levels below 10 micromol/L. In participants who underwent magnetic resonance imaging, the relationship between homocysteine and cognition was unchanged after taking into account white matter hyperintensities suggesting that white matter hyperintensities do not mediate the association between homocysteine and cognition."
"Intrathecal IgM synthesis (ITMS) predicts a worse evolution in the first stages of multiple sclerosis (MS). The aim of this study was the follow-up of a group of relapsing-remitting MS patients for a longer time to evaluate whether the ITMS implies a poor prognosis. Oligoclonal IgM bands were performed in 29 MS patients followed up from 5 to 16 years. Time to conversion to secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), time elapsed to reach a disability of 6 in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), percentage of patients with a benign MS, and changes in EDSS score were evaluated. During the follow-up, 70.8% of patients with ITMS converted to SPMS. None of the patients without ITMS did. At the end of the study, 63.6% of patients with ITMS had reached EDSS 6, whereas none of the patients lacking ITMS reached values above EDSS 3. When patients with benign MS were analyzed, 82% lacked ITMS. All patients with a nonbenign MS had ITMS. At the end of the study, the mean EDSS score was 4.64 in patients with ITMS and 1.31 in those without. The presence of oligoclonal IgM bands in cerebrospinal fluid is an unfavorable prognostic marker in MS."
"Mutations in the human caveolin-3 gene (cav-3) on chromosome 3p25 have been described in limb girdle muscular dystrophy, rippling muscle disease, hyperCKemia, and distal myopathy. Here, we describe the genetic, myopathological, and clinical findings in a large German family harboring a novel heterozygous mutation (GAC--&gt;GAA) in codon 27 of the cav-3 gene. This missense mutation causes an amino acid change from asparagine to glutamate (Asp27Glu) in the N-terminal region of the Cav-3 protein, which leads to a drastic decrease of Cav-3 protein expression in skeletal muscle tissue. In keeping with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, this novel cav-3 mutation was found to cosegregate with neuromuscular involvement in the reported family. Ultrastructural analysis of Cav-3-deficient muscle showed an abnormal folding of the plasma membrane as well as multiple vesicular structures in the subsarcolemmal region. Neurological examination of all nine subjects from three generations harboring the novel cav-3 mutation showed clear evidence of rippling muscle disease. However, only two of these nine patients showed isolated signs of rippling muscle disease without muscle weakness or atrophy, whereas five had additional signs of a distal myopathy and two fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of a coexisting limb girdle muscular dystrophy. These findings indicate that mutations in the human cav-3 gene can lead to different and overlapping clinical phenotypes even within the same family. Different clinical phenotypes in caveolinopathies may be attributed to so far unidentified modifying factors/genes in the individual genetic background of affected patients."
"Axonal degeneration can be an important cause of permanent disability in neurological disorders in which inflammation is prominent, including multiple sclerosis and Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome. The mechanisms responsible for the degeneration remain unclear, but it is likely that axons succumb to factors produced at the site of inflammation, such as nitric oxide (NO). We previously have shown that axons exposed to NO in vivo can undergo degeneration, especially if the axons are electrically active during NO exposure. The axons may degenerate because NO can inhibit mitochondrial respiration, leading to intraaxonal accumulation of Na(+) and Ca(2+) ions. Here, we show that axons can be protected from NO-mediated damage using low concentrations of Na(+) channel blockers, or an inhibitor of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange. Our findings suggest a new strategy for axonal protection in an inflammatory environment, which may be effective in preventing the accumulation of permanent disability in patients with neuroinflammatory disorders."
"Narcolepsy is a common cause of chronic sleepiness distinguished by intrusions into wakefulness of physiological aspects of rapid eye movement sleep such as cataplexy and hallucinations. Recent advances provide compelling evidence that narcolepsy may be a neurodegenerative or autoimmune disorder resulting in a loss of hypothalamic neurons containing the neuropeptide orexin (also known as hypocretin). Because orexin promotes wakefulness and inhibits rapid eye movement sleep, its absence may permit inappropriate transitions between wakefulness and sleep. These discoveries have considerably improved our understanding of the neurobiology of sleep and should foster the development of rational treatments for a variety of sleep disorders."
"Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is characterized by an isolated progressive impairment of word use and comprehension reflecting the distribution of pathological processes within the left hemisphere. We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to study in vivo the integrity of axonal fibers connecting perisylvian language areas in 11 patients with PPA, 11 subjects with Alzheimer's disease, and 22 controls. Brain metabolites (N-acetylaspartate, myoinositol, choline, creatine) were measured bilaterally within a volume of interest located in the central portion of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, a long associative bundle connecting Broca's area with Wernicke's area, and other language regions of the temporal lobe. In the PPA group, there was an asymmetrical N-acetylaspartate to creatine ratio reduction compared with Alzheimer's disease and controls, with greater changes on the left side. The myoinositol to creatine ratio was increased in the PPA group bilaterally compared with controls. The choline to creatine ratio did not differ among the three groups. These results indicate an asymmetrical focal axonal injury within the language network in PPA. The marked difference in the distribution of N-acetylaspartate to creatine between PPA and Alzheimer's disease suggests that proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy may help to differentiate between these two conditions."
"Inflammatory reactions in the central nervous system usually are considered detrimental, but recent evidence suggests that they also can be beneficial and even have neuroprotective effects. Intriguingly, immune cells can produce various neurotrophic factors of various molecular families. The concept of ""neuroprotective immunity"" will have profound consequences for the pathogenesis and treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis. It also will prove important for neurodegenerative disorders, in which inflammatory reactions often occur. This review focuses on recent findings that immune cells produce brain-derived neurotrophic factor in multiple sclerosis lesions, whereas neurons and astrocytes express the appropriate tyrosine kinase receptor TrkB. Together with functional evidence for the neuroprotective effects of immune cells, these observations support the concept of ""neuroprotective immunity."" We next examine current and future therapeutic strategies for multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in light of neuroprotective immunity and finally address the broader implications of this new concept for other neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases."
"We report a novel mutation of tau (L266V missense mutation in exon 9) which may cause a type of familial frontotemporal dementia. The brain of a patient showed Pick body-like inclusions and unique tau-positive, argyrophilic astrocytes with stout filaments and naked, round, or irregular argyrophilic inclusions with deposits of both three-repeat and four-repeat tau. Recombinant tau with a L266V mutation showed a reduced ability to promote microtubule assembly, which may be the primary effect of the mutation."
"Patients with Hodgkin's disease can develop paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia because of the generation of autoantibodies against mGluR1 (mGluR1-Abs). Yet, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying their motor coordination deficits remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that application of IgG purified from the patients' serum to cerebellar slices of mice acutely reduces the basal activity of Purkinje cells, whereas application to the flocculus of mice in vivo evokes acute disturbances in the performance of their compensatory eye movements. In addition, the mGluR1-Abs block induction of long-term depression in cultured mouse Purkinje cells, whereas the cerebellar motor learning behavior of the patients is affected in that they show impaired adaptation of their saccadic eye movements. Finally, postmortem analysis of the cerebellum of a paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia patient showed that the number of Purkinje cells was significantly reduced by approximately two thirds compared with three controls. We conclude that autoantibodies against mGluR1 can cause cerebellar motor coordination deficits caused by a combination of rapid effects on both acute and plastic responses of Purkinje cells and chronic degenerative effects."
"Chronic hydrocephalus that begins in childhood and progresses only very gradually is sometimes called ""arrested"" hydrocephalus. Data suggest that this state eventually can become symptomatic and may be treatable by shunting. However, the pathological substrate of the disorder is not entirely understood. We studied chronic hydrocephalus in rats, 9 months after induction by kaolin injection into the cisterna magna, and in humans. In both circumstances, destruction of periventricular white matter structures was worst in those with the largest ventricles. Structures damaged include the corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, and fimbria/fornix projections from the hippocampus. Myelin turnover was increased. These changes were associated with deficits of motor and cognitive function. The cerebral cortex was largely spared. There appears to be a threshold of ventricle size beyond which functional changes manifest, but this undoubtedly is modified by factors such as age of onset and rate of enlargement. These data support the need for persistent follow-up of patients with chronic, apparently stable hydrocephalus. A slight increase in size of already enlarged ventricles might cause significant axonal damage."
"We report a patient with a meningioma presenting with Cushing's syndrome, an unprecedented paraneoplastic presentation. Molecular studies, bioassay, and high-performance liquid chromatography of tumor specimens demonstrated the synthesis and secretion of bioactive corticotropin-releasing hormone. To our knowledge, this appears to be the first report of a hormone-secreting meningioma and, further, the first clearly proven case of Cushing's syndrome due to ectopic corticotropin-releasing hormone secretion without concomitant corticotropin production."
"Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency, which so far has been exclusively detected in children, was diagnosed in a 26-year-old man. The full-blown spectrum of clinical symptoms already had been present since infancy without progression of symptoms during adolescence. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed normal findings. Ophthalmological examination showed no retinal changes. Besides creatine deficiency in the brain, a distinct lack of phosphocreatine in skeletal muscle was proved by (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Creatine substitution combined with a guanidinoacetate-lowering diet introduced first at the age of 26 years was shown to be effective by an impressive improvement of epileptic seizures, mental capabilities, and general behavior and by normalization of the (31)P spectrum in the skeletal muscle."
"We identified eight patients with a distinct magnetic resonance imaging pattern of inhomogeneous cerebral white matter abnormalities and selective involvement of brainstem and spinal tracts. Proton magnetic resonance imaging showed increased lactate in the abnormal white matter. Clinically, the patients had slowly progressive pyramidal, cerebellar, and dorsal column dysfunction. The uniform, highly characteristic magnetic resonance imaging pattern and the similarities in clinical and magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings provide evidence for a new disease entity. Autosomal recessive inheritance is likely."
"Despite circumstantial evidence that opsoclonus-myoclonus (OM) is often immune mediated, no specific autoantigen has been identified. Using sera of 21 patients with several types of OM (idiopathic, associated to small cell lung cancer, and associated to neuroblastoma), we probed a brainstem cDNA library to isolate target neuronal antigens. Thirty-seven clones coding for 25 proteins were isolated, with two groups of autoantigens emerging: (1) proteins of the postsynaptic density, among them the adenomatous polyposis coli, and 2) proteins with expression or function restricted to neurons, including RNA or DNA-binding proteins and zinc-finger proteins. Usually, each patient's serum recognized a different autoantigen, except for adenomatous polyposis coli that was recognized by sera of two patients with idiopathic OM and two control patients with nystagmus, diplopia, and paraneoplastic brainstem dysfunction. Overall, in the indicated types of OM, (1) we found frequent and heterogeneous immunity to neuronal autoantigens without a single specific antibody marker of OM, (2) the occasional detection of antibodies to known onconeuronal antigens (ie, Hu proteins) probably is related to cancer-induced immunity rather than to OM, and (3) the postsynaptic density is a frequent source of novel autoantigens, with several proteins of this complex targeted by antibodies of OM patients."
"Our objective was to determine the pattern and extent of generalized and focal neocortical atrophy that develops in patients with epilepsy and the factors associated with such changes. As part of a prospective, longitudinal follow-up study of 122 patients with chronic epilepsy, 68 newly diagnosed patients, and 90 controls, serial magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained 3.5 years apart. Image subtraction was used to identify diffuse and focal neocortical change that was quantified with a regional brain atlas and a fully automated segmentation algorithm. New focal or generalized neocortical volume losses were identified in 54% of patients with chronic epilepsy, 39% of newly diagnosed patients and 24% of controls. Patients with chronic epilepsy were significantly more likely to develop neocortical atrophy than control subjects. The increased risk of cerebral atrophy in epilepsy was not related to a history of documented seizures. Risk factors for neocortical atrophy were age and multiple antiepileptic drug exposure. Focal and generalized neocortical atrophy commonly develops in chronic epilepsy. Neocortical changes seen in a quarter of our control group over 3.5 years were likely to reflect physiological changes. Our results show that ongoing cerebral atrophy may be widespread and remote from the putative epileptic focus, possibly reflecting extensive networks and interconnections between cortical regions."
"Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by episodes of transient hemiparesis followed by headache. Two chromosomal loci are associated to FHM: FHM1 on chromosome 19 and FHM2 on chromosome 1q21-23. Mutations of the alpha-1A subunit of the voltage gated calcium channel (CACNA1A) are responsible for FHM1. FHM2 critical region spans 28 cM, hence hampering the identification of the responsible gene. Here, we report the FHM2 locus refining by linkage analysis on two large Italian families affected by pure FHM. The new critical region covers a small area of 0.9Mb in 1q23 and renders feasible a positional candidate approach. By mutation analysis, we excluded the calsequestrin and two potassium channel genes mapping within the narrowed FHM2 locus."
"Opioid ligands may exert antinociception through receptors expressed on peripheral afferent axons. Whether local opioid receptors might attenuate neuropathic pain is uncertain. In this work, we examined the function and expression of local mu opioid receptors (MORs) associated with the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of sciatic neuropathic pain in rats. Low-dose morphine or its carrier were percutaneously superfused over the CCI site with the injector blinded to the identity of the injectate. Morphine, but not its carrier, and not equimolar systemic doses of morphine reversed thermal hyperalgesia in a dose-related, naloxone-sensitive fashion. Moreover, analgesia was conferred at both 48 hours and 14 days after CCI, times associated with very different stages of nerve repair. Equimolar local DAGO ([D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-(ol)] enkephalin), a selective MOR ligand, provided similar analgesia. Local morphine also attenuated mechanical allodynia. MOR protein was expressed in axonal endbulbs of Cajal just proximal to the injury site, in aberrantly regenerating small axons in the epineurial sheath around the CCI site and in residual small axons distal to the CCI lesion. Sensory neurons ipsilateral to CCI had an increase in the proportion of neurons expressing MOR. We suggest that local MOR expressed in axons may be exploited to modulate some forms of neuropathic pain."
"Proteolipid protein (PLP1) and its alternatively spliced isoform, DM20, are the major myelin proteins in the CNS, but are also expressed in the PNS. The proteins have an identical sequence except for 35 amino acids in PLP1 (the PLP1-specific domain) not present in DM20. Mutations of PLP1/DM20 cause Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease (PMD), a leukodystrophy, and in some instances, a peripheral neuropathy. To identify which mutations cause neuropathy, we have evaluated a cohort of patients with PMD and PLP1 mutations for the presence of neuropathy. As shown previously, all patients with PLP1 null mutations had peripheral neuropathy. We also identified 4 new PLP1 point mutations that cause both PMD and peripheral neuropathy, three of which truncate PLP1 expression within the PLP1-specific domain, but do not alter DM20. The fourth, a splicing mutation, alters both PLP1 and DM20, and is probably a null mutation. Six PLP1 point mutations predicted to produce proteins with an intact PLP1-specific domain do not cause peripheral neuropathy. Sixty-one individuals with PLP1 duplications also had normal peripheral nerve function. These data demonstrate that expression of PLP1 but not DMSO is necessary to prevent neuropathy, and suggest that the 35 amino acid PLP1-specific domain plays an important role in normal peripheral nerve function."
We intracisternally transplanted subventricular zone (SVZ) cells labeled by ferromagnetic particles into stroked rats. Migration of transplanted cells was non-invasively tracked using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We found that transplanted cells selectively migrated towards the ischemic parenchyma at a mean speed of 65 +/- 14.6 microm/hr in living rats. Migration of transplanted cells in the brain was also measured histopathologically. Rats transplanted with SVZ cells exhibited significant improvement of neurological function. Our data suggest that intracisternal transplantation of SVZ cells provides an avenue for cell therapy of stroke and that MRI can be used to track grafted cells in the brain.
