"With increasing age comes an increased risk for sustaining traumatic brain injuries (TBI). However, the effect of age is rarely studied in animal models of TBI. The present study evaluated the effect of increased age on recovery of function following bilateral medial frontal cortex injury. Groups of young (3 months) and middle-aged (14 months) rats received bilateral frontal cortex contusions or sham injuries. The rats were tested on a variety of tests to measure sensorimotor performance (bilateral tactile adhesive removal test), skilled forelimb use (staircase test), and the acquisition of reference and working memory in the Morris water maze. Results indicated that injury produced significant impairments on all behavioral tests compared to sham controls. Middle-aged rats that received cortical contusions were significantly impaired on the bilateral tactile adhesive removal test, acquisition of a reference memory task, and working memory compared to young-injured rats. Histological analysis showed that middle-aged rats developed significantly larger lesion cavities but did not show an increase in the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP+) cells compared to young-injured rats. Age alone also significantly impaired function on the bilateral adhesive tactile removal test, skilled forelimb use, the acquisition of a reference memory task, and also increased the number of GFAP+ cells compared to young rats. These results indicate that middle-aged rats respond to brain injury differently than young rats and that age is an important factor to consider in pre-clinical efficacy studies.","With increasing age comes an increased risk for sustaining traumatic brain injuries (TBI).

"We present an fMRI study demonstrating that an onomatopoeia word highly suggestive of subjective pain, heard by the ear, significantly activates the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) while hearing non-sense words that did not imply affective pain under the same task does not activate this area in humans. We concluded that the ACC would be a pivotal locus for perceiving affective pain evoked by an onomatopoeia word that implied affective pain closely associated with the unpleasantness of pain. We suggest that the pain affect sustained by pain unpleasantness may depend on ACC-prefrontal cortical interactions that modify cognitive evaluation of emotions associated with word-induced pain.","We present an fMRI study demonstrating that an onomatopoeia word highly suggestive of subjective pain, heard by the ear, significantly activates the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) while hearing non-sense words that did not imply affective pain under the same task does not activate this area in humans.",nan,We concluded that the ACC would be a pivotal locus for perceiving affective pain evoked by an onomatopoeia word that implied affective pain closely associated with the unpleasantness of pain.

"Recent investigations in invertebrate neurobiology have opened up a new line of research into the basic behavioral, neurochemical and genomic alterations that accompany psychostimulant drug exposure. However, the extent to which such findings relate to changes in motivational and learning processes, such as those that typify drug addictions, remains unclear. The present study addressed this issue in the crayfish, Orconectes rusticus. The first set of experiments demonstrated that intramuscular injections of cocaine and amphetamine have robust and distinguishable effects on crayfish behavior. In the second part of the study, the reinforcing properties of psychostimulants were tested in a series of conditioned place preference experiments. Amphetamine and, to a lesser extent, cocaine were both found to serve as rewards when their intra-circulatory infusion was coupled to a distinct visual environment. The monoaminergic regulation of behavior has been extensively studied in decapod crustaceans and the present experiments demonstrated that (mammalian) drugs of abuse, capable of interfering with monoamine chemistry, are similarly rewarding to crayfish. Behavioral studies in crayfish can provide a complementary approach to using other invertebrate species in addiction research.","Recent investigations in invertebrate neurobiology have opened up a new line of research into the basic behavioral, neurochemical and genomic alterations that accompany psychostimulant drug exposure.

"Human and animal studies indicate that repeated stress during pregnancy can produce long-term biological and behavioural disorders in the offspring. In contrast, although maternal stress is supposed to induce an increase of maternal anxiety, few studies have been conducted to demonstrate it. Therefore, in the present study we examined the emotional reactivity in stressed (chronic restraint stress applied 3 x 45 min per day during the last week of pregnancy) and unstressed females rats after the weaning of their pups. Restraint stress procedure reduced the body weight gain both during pregnancy and up to four weeks after the stress period. Stressed dams presented a reduction of exploration and of corticosterone levels when exposed to a novel environment (25 and 49 days post-stress). They spent less time in the open arms of the elevated plus-maze (26 days post-stress). Finally, they showed no increase in the time spent in immobility after a second exposure to the forced-swim test (35-36 days post-stress). In the contrary, such differences were not observed when the chronic stress procedure was applied on virgin females. Overall, our results show that, chronic stress during gestation induces lasting effects on emotional reactivity of the dams, thus indicating that gestation constitutes a critical period in the vulnerability to stressful events also for the mother.","Human and animal studies indicate that repeated stress during pregnancy can produce long-term biological and behavioural disorders in the offspring.

"The present study examined the effects of age on concept learning in beagle dogs. In experiment one, subjects were tested on a series of 2-choice size discrimination (2CSD) tasks, in which the correct response was to always approach the larger or smaller of the two blocks. Compared to old and senior dogs, young and middle-aged dogs solved the initial training subtest faster and were more successful at transferring this learning to subsequent tests. The second experiment extended the task by using three rather than two objects and introducing novel objects to test concept acquisition. Young and middle-aged dogs made fewer errors than old or senior dogs on a 3-choice size discrimination (3CSD) task. Transfer performance was above chance for all four groups on the 3CSD and first 3-choice size concept (CSC) task and for the young dogs on the second 3CSC but did not differ from the original learning criterion in any group. Age impairments in concept learning may account for differences in transfer performance on both 3CSC tests.",The present study examined the effects of age on concept learning in beagle dogs.,"In experiment one, subjects were tested on a series of 2-choice size discrimination (2CSD) tasks, in which the correct response was to always approach the larger or smaller of the two blocks.

"The present study describes two novel tasks relying on spontaneous patterns of exploration in a radial-arm maze that can be used to assess spatial recognition memory and spatial temporal order memory (i.e. memory for the order in which places have been visited) in the rat. In the recognition memory task, rats were permitted to freely explore two arms in the maze on a first trial and one 'familiar' arm and one novelly located arm on a second trial 105 min later. In the temporal order memory task, rats were permitted to explore two arms in the maze on a first trial, two novel arms on a second trial 60 min later, and one 'older familiar' arm and one 'more recent familiar' arm on a third trial 45 min later. Using these tasks, we found that rats direct greater exploration at a novel than a familiar arm location, thus showing long-term spatial recognition memory, and at an older familiar arm than a more recent familiar arm, thus showing long-term spatial temporal order memory. Lidocaine inactivation of the mPFC prior to the final trial in each task disrupted performance on the temporal order but not the recognition memory task, thereby demonstrating a role for the mPFC in the retrieval and/or use of temporal order information but not in spatial memory per se. These findings highlight the specific involvement of the rat mPFC in temporal order memory and have important implications for a broader understanding of mPFC function.",The present study describes two novel tasks relying on spontaneous patterns of exploration in a radial-arm maze that can be used to assess spatial recognition memory and spatial temporal order memory (i.e. memory for the order in which places have been visited) in the rat.,"In the recognition memory task, rats were permitted to freely explore two arms in the maze on a first trial and one 'familiar' arm and one novelly located arm on a second trial 105 min later.

"Repeated cocaine exposure produces behavioral sensitization expressed as an increased locomotor response to subsequent drug administration. Chronic cocaine administration also results in increased activity of adenylyl cyclase and cyclic-AMP (cAMP) dependent protein kinase (PKA) in the nucleus accumbens. To investigate the relationship between cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization and cAMP signaling, the present study examined the effect of forskolin, a direct adenylyl cyclase activator, on cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion and behavioral sensitization to cocaine. Rats were given intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of a water soluble form of forskolin (7DMB-forskolin) or vehicle 10 min prior to intraperitoneal (i.p.) cocaine or saline administration on 7 consecutive days. Acute or chronic forskolin alone had no effect on locomotor activity at the doses tested. On days 1 and 2, the activity of rats that received i.c.v. forskolin paired with cocaine was not significantly different from rats that received i.c.v. injections of vehicle co-administered with cocaine. By the third day of forskolin/cocaine co-administration, rats displayed enhanced cocaine-induced hyperlocomotor activity compared to rats that received cocaine alone, an effect that persisted through day 7. When challenged with cocaine on day 14, animals that had previously received forskolin paired with cocaine on days 1-7 displayed similar locomotor activity to animals that received cocaine only. These results suggest that alterations in adenylyl cyclase activity and/or cAMP levels may underlie the hyperlocomotor response to cocaine and may play a role in behavioral sensitization.","Repeated cocaine exposure produces behavioral sensitization expressed as an increased locomotor response to subsequent drug administration.

"Specialised brain structures allow songbirds to process acoustic signals. One of these brain areas, the NCM (caudomedial neostriatum), shows an immediate-early gene ZENK response when a bird hears a conspecific song. Using a neuro-ethological approach, we investigate if high level of background noise added to conspecific song can modify this song-induced genic activation. We test the ZENK activation in the NCM of adult male Zebra finches Taeniopygya guttata (n = 17) by playing back conspecific signals mixed with different levels of noise, the successful discrimination being reflected by the birds' (n = 6) behavioural responses to these stimuli. From our results, it appears that a high genic activation of the NCM does not necessarily require the audition of an undegraded species-specific signal. Nevertheless, it requires that the signal still contains sufficient information to elicit a behavioural response. The genic activation of the NCM remains thus stable against very high levels of a wide-band background noise, as far as the signal recognition remains possible for the bird.","Specialised brain structures allow songbirds to process acoustic signals.

"Head direction (HD) cells fire in relation to an animal's directional heading. To examine how these cells may be involved in spatial behavior, HD cells were recorded while animals performed a navigation task requiring the use of a cognitive mapping strategy. Results showed no relationship between performance on the task and the directional stability of the HD cell activity. The HD cell signal, therefore, appears to not always be used by the animal to guide its behavior during all navigation tasks.","Head direction (HD) cells fire in relation to an animal's directional heading.

"In this paper the role of serotonin (5HT) and cyclic AMP (cAMP) in sensitization and dishabituation of swim induction (SI) has been investigated in the leech Hirudo medicinalis. Electrical stimulation of the body wall evokes swimming activity with a constant latency. In animals with a disconnection between head ganglion and segmental ganglia, repetitive stimulation induces habituation of swimming whereas brushing on the dorsal skin provokes sensitization of a na&#xef;ve response or dishabituation of a previously habituated response. Our findings indicate that 5HT is the neurotransmitter underlying both sensitization and dishabituation of SI. Injection of the 5HT receptor blocking agent methysergide impaires the onset of sensitization and dishabituation induced by brushing. Moreover, injection of 5HT mimics these forms of nonassociative learning, whereas injection of dopamine does not. Finally, the effects of 5HT are mediated by cAMP: (1) after injections of specific adenylate cyclase inhibitors such as MDL 12.330A or SQ22536, brushing becomes ineffective in facilitating the SI in either non-habituated or habituated animals. (2) 8Br-cAMP application mimics both sensitization and dishabituation of SI.","In this paper the role of serotonin (5HT) and cyclic AMP (cAMP) in sensitization and dishabituation of swim induction (SI) has been investigated in the leech Hirudo medicinalis.

"Four experiments with C57BL/6 mice examined the effects of protein synthesis inhibition on extinction of spatial preferences in the Morris water maze. The protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin was injected systemically immediately after spatial reversal sessions, which consisted of eight, two, or one reversal trials. Anisomycin had no effect on extinction of a spatial preference with eight reversal trials per session. When only two reversal trials were administered per session, anisomycin slowed extinction initially, although full extinction occurred with further training even in the presence of anisomycin. In both cases, anisomycin blocked acquisition of the reversal preference. When anisomycin injections followed a single simple extinction trial, performance was not disrupted. These findings suggest that acquisition and extinction may involve different molecular processes, and they do not support the idea that brief extinction trials induce a protein synthesis-dependent reconsolidation phase of spatial memory.",Four experiments with C57BL/6 mice examined the effects of protein synthesis inhibition on extinction of spatial preferences in the Morris water maze.,"The protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin was injected systemically immediately after spatial reversal sessions, which consisted of eight, two, or one reversal trials.","Anisomycin had no effect on extinction of a spatial preference with eight reversal trials per session.

"Our previous study showed the microinjection of drugs that influence the nitric oxide (NO)-mediated neurotransmission in the hippocampus impacts upon the anxiolytic-like effect of ethanol. In this study, we examined whether NO-dependent pathways of the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG) participate in the anxiolytic effect of ethanol in rats submitted to the elevated plus-maze test. We evaluated the impact on ethanol effects of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor 7-nitroindazole, the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1H-(1,2,4)-oxodiazolo (4,3-a) quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), the cyclic guanylate monophosphate (cGMP) analogue 8-bromo-cGMP and the NO donor sodium nitroprusside. The results showed that ODQ and 7-nitroindazole increased the percentage of open arm entries and of time spent on open arms in the elevated plus maze in rats injected with ethanol at 1.0g/kg, a dose that did not produce anxiolysis per se. Conversely, 8-bromo-cGMP and sodium nitroprusside blocked the increased exploration of open arms exhibited by rats treated with a higher dose of ethanol (1.2g/kg). Taken together, the results suggest that the inhibition of NO-dependent pathways of the dlPAG enhances the anxiolytic effect of ethanol, whereas the activation of these pathways results in an opposite effect.",Our previous study showed the microinjection of drugs that influence the nitric oxide (NO)-mediated neurotransmission in the hippocampus impacts upon the anxiolytic-like effect of ethanol.,"In this study, we examined whether NO-dependent pathways of the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG) participate in the anxiolytic effect of ethanol in rats submitted to the elevated plus-maze test.

"The insular gustatory cortex may be essential for the evaluation of saliency and representation of the incentive values of tastes. Gustatory cortex lesions should interfere with conditioned taste avoidance according to these factors, which depend on the conditioned taste avoidance protocol used. The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of bilateral lesions of the gustatory cortex-focusing on electrolytic and excitotoxic lesions. Lesioned and sham-operated male Long-Evans rats were intoxicated using LiCl after drinking sucrose from a tube (SD) or having the same amount of sucrose fed directly into their mouths through a chronically implanted intra-oral (IO) cannula. Every aspect of the experiment was carefully counterbalanced between the experimental groups. In the control groups, the acquired avoidance towards sucrose was strongly preserved over eight extinction test days in SD rats but not in IO rats, in which a progressive decline was recorded. Electrolytic gustatory cortex lesions impaired but did not suppress conditioned taste avoidance in both protocols. Excitotoxic lesions tend to impair CTA also, but differentially according to the SD or IO protocols. Extinction of CTA was selectively impaired in the SD protocol by small lesions destroying the anterior insular cortex.","The insular gustatory cortex may be essential for the evaluation of saliency and representation of the incentive values of tastes.

"Neuroimaging cognitive study of aging requires simple tasks ensuring a high rate of correct performances even in stressful neurophysiological settings. Here two simple delayed choice reaction time tasks were used to unveil event-related desynchronization (ERD) of theta (4-6 Hz) and alpha (6-12 Hz) electroencephalographic rhythms across normal aging. In the first condition, a cue stimulus (one bit) was memorized along a brief delay period (3.5-5.5 s). The explicit demand was visuo-spatial, but the retention could be also based on phonological and somatomotor coding. In the second condition, the cue stimulus remained available along the delay period. Correct performances were higher than 95% in both groups and tasks, although they were significantly better in young than elderly subjects (P &lt; 0.03). During the delay period, theta and alpha ERD accompanying correct responses were recognized in the two groups, the alpha ERD being stronger and prolonged during the memory than non-memory task. On the other hand, the fronto-parietal theta and parietal alpha ERD were stronger in young than elderly subjects during both tasks. Notably, the frontal alpha ERD was negligible in elderly subjects. In conclusion, the present simple tasks unveiled in elderly compared to young subjects (i) a weaker involvement of (para)hippocampal-cortical circuits as revealed by theta ERD and (ii) a weaker involvement of ""executive"" thalamo-cortical circuits as revealed by frontal alpha ERD.

"Homocystinuria is an inherited metabolic disease biochemically characterized by tissue accumulation of homocysteine. Affected patients present mental retardation and other neurological symptoms whose mechanisms are still obscure. In the present study, we investigated the effect of chronic hyperhomocysteinemia on rat performance in the Morris water maze task. Chronic treatment was administered from the 6th to the 28th day of life by s.c. injection of homocysteine, twice a day at 8-h intervals; control rats received the same volume of saline solution. Animals were left to recover until the 60th day of life. Morris water maze tasks were then performed, in order to verify any effect of early homocysteine administration on reference and working memory of rats. Results showed that chronic treatment with homocysteine impaired memory of the platform location and that homocysteine treated animals presented fewer crossings to the place where the platform was located in training trials when compared to saline-treated animals (controls). In the working memory task, homocysteine treated animals also needed more time to find the platform. Our findings suggest that chronic experimental hyperhomocysteinemia causes cognitive dysfunction and that might be related to the neurological complications characteristic of homocystinuric patients.",Homocystinuria is an inherited metabolic disease biochemically characterized by tissue accumulation of homocysteine.

"Although the basolateral amygdala (BLA) plays a role in the habituation to sensory stimuli, the receptor mechanisms mediating this process remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of BLA dopamine (DA) in the habituation of the acoustic startle response (ASR) with intra-BLA infusions of DA receptor antagonists. Male Long Evans rats were subjected to startle pulses over two consecutive once-daily sessions. Prior to testing on Day 1, separate groups of animals received bilateral intra-BLA infusions of a D1 (SCH 23390: 0, 3.2, 6.4 microg per side) or a D2/D3 (raclopride: 0, 2.5, 5.0 microg per side) receptor antagonist. Animals were retested 24h later (Day 2) without prior drug infusion in order to assess possible treatment effects on within- and between-session habituation of the ASR. As expected, within- and between-session habituation was observed in vehicle-treated controls. Within-session habituation was also seen in SCH 23390- and raclopride-treated animals both on Day 1 as well as 24h later (Day 2). Evidence of between-session habituation was observed in SCH 23390-treated animals. However, compared to vehicle, intra-BLA SCH 23390 or raclopride attenuated the initial startle response on Day 1, but not Day 2. No evidence of between-session habituation was found in raclopride-treated animals, although this probably reflected the attenuated initial response to the startling stimulus on Day 1 rather than a reduced rate of habituation on Day 2. The present study suggests that while BLA DA is not involved in habituation of the ASR, it may mediate the perceived aversive nature of the initially startling stimuli.","Although the basolateral amygdala (BLA) plays a role in the habituation to sensory stimuli, the receptor mechanisms mediating this process remain unclear.","In the present study, we investigated the role of BLA dopamine (DA) in the habituation of the acoustic startle response (ASR) with intra-BLA infusions of DA receptor antagonists.

"The activation of alpha2-adrenoceptors has been reported to impair memory functions in both rats and humans. The alpha2-adrenoceptor subtype responsible for this detrimental effect is still unknown. The effect of the alpha2-agonists clonidine and guanabenz on memory processes, in dependence to the time of administration, was evaluated in the mouse passive avoidance test. Clonidine (0.02-0.2 mg kg(-1) i.p.) and guanabenz (0.1-0.3 mg kg(-1) i.p.) induced amnesia in a dose-dependent manner. From time-course experiments emerged that the impairment of memory function was detectable only when clonidine and guanabenz were administered 60 min before or immediately after the training test, respectively. This detrimental effect was prevented by pretreatment with the alpha2-antagonist yohimbine (1-3 mg kg(-1) i.p.) and by the alpha2A-antagonist BRL-44408 (0.3-1 mg kg(-1) i.p.). By contrast, the alpha(2B,C) antagonists ARC-239 (10 mg kg(-1) i.p.) and prazosin (1 mg kg(-1) i.p.) did not revert the amnesia induced by both clonidine and guanabenz. At the highest effective doses, clonidine and guanabenz were devoid of behavioral side-effects as well as maintained unaltered the motor coordination, as revealed by the rota-rod test. Furthermore, none of the compounds used modified the spontaneous motility as indicated by the Animex apparatus. These results indicate that clonidine and guanabenz impaired memory processes in a mouse passive avoidance paradigm through the selective activation of the alpha2A-adrenoceptor subtype.",The activation of alpha2-adrenoceptors has been reported to impair memory functions in both rats and humans.

"The present rat study assessed the relationship between, and the sensitivity of, two different tests for appetitive conditioned responding to differences in the contingency between a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US), and to differences in US magnitude. The first test used a Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) paradigm, assessing the capacity of the CS to enhance instrumental responding for food. The second test employed a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm with an extended CS-US interval, and total number of behavioural elements in this interval as a dependent measure. The PIT test proved to be sensitive to contingency but not reward magnitude differences, whereas the reverse was true for the Pavlovian test. Although there was a significant correlation between tests in the magnitude of the CS-induced increase of food-magazine entries, the main dependent measure from PIT (number of lever presses) and that from the Pavlovian test (total number of behavioural elements) did not correlate. It is suggested that in the PIT procedure, the CS induces a chain of behavioural responses of which lever pressing is just a single element and that the Pavlovian test, in principle, is more sensitive.","The present rat study assessed the relationship between, and the sensitivity of, two different tests for appetitive conditioned responding to differences in the contingency between a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US), and to differences in US magnitude.","The first test used a Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) paradigm, assessing the capacity of the CS to enhance instrumental responding for food.

"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine shown to affect brain function and to be involved in pathological neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study we investigated the cognitive function in transgenic mice not expressing IL-6 (IL-6 KO) and in wild type (WT) genotype at 4 and 12 months of age, using a passive avoidance and an eight-arm radial maze tasks. Motor function was quantified using an Animex apparatus. Hippocampal choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity was evaluated in both genotypes. No difference was observed in both genotypes for spontaneous motor activity. The mean latency (s) to re-enter the shock box, was similar in both young mutant and WT mice. However, a decreased sensitivity (50%) to scopolamine (1 mg/kg) in mutant compared to WT mice, was obtained. IL-6 KO mice exhibited a facilitation of radial maze learning over 30 days, in terms of a lower number of working memory errors and a higher percentage of animals reaching the criterion as compared with WT genotype tested at both ages. Furthermore, mutant mice, at the age of 12 months, showed a faster acquisition (22 days versus 30 days to reach the criterion). The pattern of arm entry exhibited by IL-6 KO mice showed a robust tendency to enter an adjacent arm at both ages, while WT only at the age of 4 months. ChAT activity was inversely correlated with memory performance.

"Because it was designed to assess working memory, the delayed spatial win-shift (DSWS) radial maze task has been used to investigate the involvement of corticostriatal structures in executive processing. Excitotoxic lesions of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) produce profound deficits in performance of this task that are not accounted for by motor impairment. Thus, PPTg DSWS deficits are hypothesized to support a role for PPTg in complex cognitive processing. However, other studies indicate that the behaviour of PPTg lesioned rats varies depending on level of motivational excitement, assessed by the presence or absence of deprivation, or by manipulations of reward value. Since DSWS performance may also be affected by motivational dysfunction, the present experiment was conducted to examine the effects of post-surgical presentation of a more positive food reward (chocolate drops) on the DSWS retention performance of PPTg lesioned rats. Results confirmed a PPTg lesion deficit: lesioned rats made significantly more errors in both training and test phases, and made errors significantly earlier in their choice sequence in the test phase. Main effects of phase on number of errors indicated that the PPTg test phase deficit was not simply the result of a carry-over impairment from the training phase. PPTg rats receiving chocolate made significantly fewer errors than PPTg rats receiving food pellets. Results suggest that PPTg DSWS deficits are not the result of altered motivation or hedonic appreciation of reward value (or reward change) and therefore support the hypothesis of executive cognitive deficits in PPTg lesioned rats.","Because it was designed to assess working memory, the delayed spatial win-shift (DSWS) radial maze task has been used to investigate the involvement of corticostriatal structures in executive processing.

"Animal studies examining the effects of stress upon brain serotonergic neurons have not presented a clearcut and consistent picture. One stressor that has been shown to exert a consistently strong effect on serotonin release and c-fos activation in the dorsal raphe nucleus of rats is a series of inescapable electrical shocks. Using immunohistochemical double labeling for c-fos activation and serotonin, we examined the effects of delivering 100 inescapable tailshocks to rats on serotonergic neuronal activation throughout the brainstem raphe system. This stimulus exerted a consistent and strong activation of the entire midline brain stem system of serotonergic neurons.

"Peripherally and locally administered rotenone (an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I) has been proposed as a model of Parkinson's disease (PD) as it induces nigrostriatal degeneration associated with alpha-synuclein inclusions. If rotenone-induced symptoms represent a model of PD, than they should be counteracted by L-DOPA. To answer this question, rats were treated with rotenone 2.5 mg/kg over 48 days. Behavioural data showed a strong increase in catalepsy, a decrease in locomotor activity and biochemical data showed a significant depletion of dopamine levels in the striatum (Cpu) and substantia nigra in rotenone treated animals compared to vehicle. To examine the effectiveness of L-DOPA in reversing the motor deficit in rats, a dose of L-DOPA (10 mg/kg) in combination with the peripheral amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor benserazide were daily administrated intraperitonially for a period of 10 days in the rotenone-treated rats. This treatment counteracted catalepsy and increased locomotor activity and number of rearings but decreased inactive sitting. In this animal model (rotenone model), catalepsy tests and motor activities showed that the clinically used anti-parkinsonian drug L-DOPA substitutes rotenone-induced dopamine (DA) deficiency.","Peripherally and locally administered rotenone (an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I) has been proposed as a model of Parkinson's disease (PD) as it induces nigrostriatal degeneration associated with alpha-synuclein inclusions.

"Behavioural sleep during the first 2 weeks after hatching was studied in male chicks reared with an imprinting object (I-chicks) and in social isolation (NI-chicks). Time spent in sleeping with both eyes closed (binocular sleep) decreased gradually with age in both I-chicks and in NI-chicks whilst the number of episodes of binocular sleep decreased with age in NI-chicks but not in I-chicks. The pattern of monocular sleep (only one eye closed) of both I-chicks and NI-chicks showed no significant bias towards predominant left- or right-eye closure during the first week. During the second week, I-chicks showed a tendency towards more pronounced left-eye closure with a peak on day 10, whilst NI-chicks showed a tendency for more pronounced right-eye closure with peaks on days 9 and 11.

"Neurons in the monkey's anterior parietal cortex (Brodmann's areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 2) have been reported to retain information from a visual cue that has been associated with a tactile stimulus in a haptic memory task. This cross-modal transfer indicates that neurons in somatosensory cortex can respond to non-tactile stimuli if they are associated with tactile information needed for performance of the task. We hypothesized that neurons in somatosensory cortex would be activated by other non-tactile stimuli signaling the haptic movements--of arm and hand--that the task required. We found such cells in anterior parietal areas. They reacted with short-latency activity changes to an auditory signal (a click) that prompted those movements. Further, some of those cells changed their discharge in temporal correlation with the movements themselves, with the touch of the test objects, and with the short-term memory of those objects for subsequent tactile discrimination. These findings suggest that cells in the somatosensory cortex participate in the behavioral integration of auditory stimuli with other sensory stimuli and with motor acts that are associated with those stimuli.","Neurons in the monkey's anterior parietal cortex (Brodmann's areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 2) have been reported to retain information from a visual cue that has been associated with a tactile stimulus in a haptic memory task.

"Recent evidence indicates that the pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs) can affect learning and memory processes. To examine the effect of the PICs on leverpress escape/avoidance conditioning, we injected male Sprague-Dawley rats with IL-1beta, IL-6 (both 3.0 microg/kg, i.p.), TNFalpha (6.0 microg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle, 24h before a single 4-h session of leverpress escape/avoidance conditioning. The TNFalpha-treated animals made more avoidance responses and fewer escape responses than controls during the last hour of the session.

"The early postnatal brain development, when many potentially sensitive processes occur, has been shown to be vulnerable to different pharmacological and environmental compounds. In the present investigation, four groups of neonatal NMRI male mice were administered the glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine (50 mg/kg, s.c.), or the GABA(A) receptor agonist diazepam (5 mg/kg, s.c.), or co-administered ketamine (50 mg/kg, s.c.) and diazepam (5 mg/kg, s.c.), or vehicle (0.9% saline, s.c.) on day 10 after birth. On day 11, mice from each treatment group were sacrificed and brains were taken for analysis of neuronal cell degeneration, using Fluoro-Jade staining technique. Ketamine, but not diazepam, induced a severe degeneration of cells in the parietal cortex. The opposite was observed for diazepam in the laterodorsal thalamus. The most pronounced cell degeneration was seen in parietal cortex of mice exposed to both ketamine and diazepam. At 2 months of age each treatment group was tested for motor activity and learning performance. Ketamine and ketamine + diazepam treated mice displayed severe deficits of habituation to the test chamber in the spontaneous motor activity test, marked deficits of acquisition learning and retention memory in the radial arm maze-learning task and less shift learning in the circular swim maze-learning task. This study indicates that the observed functional deficits can be related to cell degeneration induced during a critical stage of neonatal brain development. The potentiated apoptosis induced by ketamine and diazepam may have implications for the selection of drugs used in neonatal paediatric anaesthesia.","The early postnatal brain development, when many potentially sensitive processes occur, has been shown to be vulnerable to different pharmacological and environmental compounds.","In the present investigation, four groups of neonatal NMRI male mice were administered the glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine (50 mg/kg, s.c.), or the GABA(A) receptor agonist diazepam (5 mg/kg, s.c.), or co-administered ketamine (50 mg/kg, s.c.) and diazepam (5 mg/kg, s.c.), or vehicle (0.9% saline, s.c.) on day 10 after birth.

"Four strains of mice were compared regarding their relative abilities to solve the Morris water maze test of spatial memory. Members of the New Zealand Black (NZB) strain revealed steady improvement over the 6 days of training comparable to C57BL/6 mice. The neurotrophin low affinity receptor p75 knockout mouse, in which the binding region is rendered refractory to ligand, displayed profound deficits in the acquisition of this task. Members of the Swiss Webster strain performed intermediate between the poor performance of the p75 mice and the progressively improving learning curves of the NZB and C57 mice. The present results support the notion that interference with functioning of nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors on forebrain cholingergic neurons negatively impacts the animal's ability to utilize the spatial cues necessary for successful spatial navigation. This effect on NGF receptors was more behaviorally disrupting than the influence of neocortical and hippocampal ectopias as present in the NZB mice. These results support the use of the p75 knockout mouse as a model of forebrain cholinergic neuron dysfunction. On the other hand, these results do not support the use of the NZB mouse as an animal model of human learning disability and dementia.",Four strains of mice were compared regarding their relative abilities to solve the Morris water maze test of spatial memory.,"Members of the New Zealand Black (NZB) strain revealed steady improvement over the 6 days of training comparable to C57BL/6 mice.

"In this study, we divided 26 fetuses at 32-37 weeks of gestation into three groups using combined criteria of gestational age and behavioral indicators. We investigated fetal habituation to vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS). Fetuses showed habituation from at least 32 weeks of gestation. Furthermore, fetuses less developed from behavioral standpoint took significantly more trials to achieve habituation than developed fetuses even in the same gestational age. Taken together with these data, it was proved that there was a relationship between aspects of behavioral development and habituation.","In this study, we divided 26 fetuses at 32-37 weeks of gestation into three groups using combined criteria of gestational age and behavioral indicators.",We investigated fetal habituation to vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS).,"Fetuses showed habituation from at least 32 weeks of gestation.

"The primary visual cortex of rats is surrounded laterally (in Oc2L) and medially (in Oc2M) by several peristriate visual areas. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that bilateral lesions in Oc2L result in visual pattern discrimination deficit, and in failure to solve a conditional discrimination which requires figure-background association. In contrast, neurotoxic lesions of the rostral part of Oc2M (which contains the anteromedial and anterior peristriate visual areas, collectively referred to as AM complex) result in deficits in visuospatial discrimination, and in disruptions in visual tasks involving spatial memory. The objective of this study was to behaviorally test the role of AM complex in a spatial memory task in absence of visual cues. For this purpose, we analyzed memory retention of Lashley III maze in blind rats after bilateral ibotenate lesions in AM complex, or in the primary visual cortex (V1, Oc1), to test the hypothesis that AM complex is essential for this cognitive task. The results showed a significant loss of memory retention of the maze in rats with lesions in AM complex, but not in rats with lesions in V1. Furthermore, the retention loss in rats with AM complex lesions was positively and significantly correlated with the size of the lesion. The results indicate a critical role of AM complex in spatial memory mechanisms independent on visual cues. A probable homology of rat AM complex with the posterior parietal cortex of primates is discussed.","The primary visual cortex of rats is surrounded laterally (in Oc2L) and medially (in Oc2M) by several peristriate visual areas.

"The behavioral phenotype of five-month-old rats overexpressing neuropeptide Y (NPY) has previously been described [Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97 (2000) 12852]. In this transgenic rat model, there is central overexpression of prepro-NPY mRNA and NPY peptide in the hippocampus and hypothalamus and decreased Y1 binding sites within the hippocampus. These molecular and neurochemical events led to altered anxiety profile and learning abilities in NPY-overexpressing rats. In the present study, anxiety and learning/memory related behaviors were examined in one-year-old NPY-transgenic rats in order to assess any behavioral changes that may have occurred during the aging process. As observed in 5-month-old overexpressing rats, aged NPY-transgenic animals are resistant to acute physical restraint stress measured by the elevated-plus maze and demonstrate anxiolytic-like activity in the open field. However, in contrast to data in young rats, there was no significant difference between aged wildtype and NPY-transgenic animals in relation to spatial and non-spatial memory as indicated by the (allo- and ego-centric) Morris water maze and object recognition test. It would thus appear that the anxiolytic-like profile observed in young NPY-overexpressing rats is maintained in older animals providing further evidence for a role for NPY in anxious behaviors. However, the cognitive deficits observed in young rats do not appear to occur in older animals suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms leading to a reversal of the learning deficits noted in younger animals. These results also provide additional evidence for the mechanistic dissociation between anxiety and cognition-related behaviors modulated by NPY.","The behavioral phenotype of five-month-old rats overexpressing neuropeptide Y (NPY) has previously been described [Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97 (2000) 12852].

"The olfactory bulbectomised (OB) rat is being increasingly used as a model of impaired learning and mnemonic functioning. In this study the model has been utilised to determine the effect of the acetylcholinesterase inhibiting compounds tacrine and physostigmine on spatial working memory deficits associated with the OB rat. One-hundred and twenty male rats were randomly allocated to OB or sham operated groups and received chronic i.p. treatment with either saline, physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg) or tacrine (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg). Two weeks after beginning treatment animals were tested on the Morris water maze and open field test. The results indicated that the OB surgery was associated with spatial working memory disturbances that were effectively attenuated with both doses of tacrine, but not physostigmine. Increased hyperactivity and defecation was observed in OB animals in the Open-field test, however, these changes were not ameliorated by either drug treatment. The ability for tacrine but not physostigmine to attenuate OB cognitive deficits may be associated with the different half-life of these compounds. This study provides further support for the use of the OB rat as a drug discovery model for the investigation of novel therapeutic compounds that target the cholinergic system.",The olfactory bulbectomised (OB) rat is being increasingly used as a model of impaired learning and mnemonic functioning.

"The prefrontal cortex is involved in various aspects of working memory like stimulus maintenance and response selection functions. Neurobehavioral studies and neurocomputational models assume a role for NMDA receptors in prefrontal cortex for maintenance processes, while our previous studies on NMDA receptors in the avian prefrontal cortex-analogue, the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), showed them to be involved in response selection functions. Various tasks used in PFC-related research address in fact both functions, so they cannot disambiguate their separate contributions to performance. In order to investigate the role of NMDA receptors in avian NCL for stimulus maintenance and response selection, we trained pigeons in a delayed matching-to sample (DMTS) task, requiring both functions, and a simultaneous matching to sample (SMTS) task, requiring only response selection. After reaching criterion, pigeons had to perform the tasks alternately under local NMDA receptor blockade in NCL (DL-AP5) and after infusion of vehicle (saline solution). Blockade of NCL-based NMDA receptors led to significant increases in error rates in both DMTS and SMTS--compared with the same subjects' performance during training and in the control condition. However, there was no additional increase in errors due to the additional maintenance component, so the impairment appears to be due to deficits in adequate selection of responses, the function necessary for both tasks. We conclude that NMDA receptors in the pigeon NCL participate in response selection rather than stimulus maintenance in tasks requiring the processing of context information.","The prefrontal cortex is involved in various aspects of working memory like stimulus maintenance and response selection functions.

"Reduced NMDA receptor function is hypothesized to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In order to model chronic and developmental NMDA receptor hypofunction, a mouse line was developed that expresses low levels of the NMDA R1 subunit (NR1) of the NMDA receptor. The present study tested the hypothesis that these NR1 hypomorphic mice would exhibit deficits in sensorimotor and conspecific interactions, analogous to deficits observed in schizophrenic patients. F1 hybrid mice homozygous for the NR1 hypomorphic mutation (NR1 -/-) were generated by crossing heterozygous mice (NR1 +/-) from C57BL/6 and 129 Sv/Ev backgrounds. To assess sensorimotor gating, mice were tested in the paradigm of prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle. The NR1 hypomorphic mice exhibited increased acoustic startle responses and also showed deficits in prepulse inhibition. Startle responses were differentially altered by predator odor exposure in the male NR1 -/- mice, in comparison to control mice. In a test of social affiliation, the wild type mice spent significantly more time investigating a novel mouse in comparison to the NR1 -/- mice. In a resident-intruder test, marked deficits were found in sex-specific aggressive behavior between the wild type and mutant mice. These data support the contention that the NR1 hypomorphic mice exhibit alterations in sensorimotor gating and typical conspecific interactions, reminiscent of behavioral disturbances associated with schizophrenia. The NR1 hypomorphic mice could represent a model system to explore novel treatment and preventative strategies for certain symptoms of schizophrenia.","Reduced NMDA receptor function is hypothesized to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

"Paw use in a task consisting of the removal of a piece of adhesive paper from the snout was investigated in 80 mongrel and pure-bred domestic dogs (Canis familiaris). Population lateralisation was observed, but in opposite directions in the two sexes (animals were not desexed): males preferentially used their left paw, females their right paw. The relationship between immune function and paw preference was then investigated. Some immune parameters (total number of white blood cells including lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes; leukocyte formula; total proteins; gamma-globulins) were investigated in a sample of left-pawed (n = 6), right-pawed (n = 6) and ambidextrous (n = 6) dogs. The results showed that the percentage of lymphocytes was higher in left-pawed than in right-pawed and ambidextrous dogs, whereas granulocytes percentage was lower in left-pawed than in right-pawed and ambidextrous dogs.

"The purpose of this study was to examine the role of the thalamofugal pathway in far-field visual processing. Experiment 1 examined the role of the visual wulst and the ectostriatum in a far-field pattern discrimination task in a large open arena. Control pigeons, pigeons with ectostriatum lesions, and pigeons with wulst lesions were trained to discriminate between four patterns within the arena. Ectostriatum-lesioned pigeons were unimpaired and behaved similar to controls. By contrast, wulst-lesioned pigeons were severely impaired in the pattern discrimination task in the open arena and performed poorer than control pigeons and pigeons with ectostriatum lesions. Statistical analyses of regional contributions to the observed impairment identified the left visual wulst and bilateral hyperstriatum ventrale, which lies outside the wulst, as interesting areas. To ensure that the impairment was not due to a general learning deficit, experiment 2 involved training the pigeons in a pattern discrimination task carried out in an operant chamber, which presumably required use of near-field visual information. Wulst-lesioned pigeons were able to learn the task and performed at a level no different from control pigeons.

"The Ts65Dn mouse is the most studied and genetically the most complete animal model of Down syndrome (DS) available. These mice display many DS-like features, including performance deficits in different behavioral tasks, motor dysfunction, and age-dependent loss of cholinergic markers in the basal forebrain. At present, the only robust data demonstrating a behavioral deficit potentially associated with learning and memory in Ts65Dn mice less than 6 months old have come from studies that used some variation of the Morris water maze task. However, the specific features of the water maze deficits seen in these animals are still poorly defined. This study is an initial attempt to bridge this knowledge gap. We investigated three major factors potentially influencing the performance of Ts65Dn mice in the water maze: (1) order in which the test is executed; (2) age of the animals; and (3) levels of aversiveness associated with the test. Measurements of plasma corticosterone levels and core body temperature after swimming were also carried out in additional subsets of mice. Overall, we found that the behavioral phenotype of Ts65Dn mice was milder than previously described in the literature. Additionally, Ts65Dn mice were significantly more responsive to potential stressors and more prone to swim-induced hypothermia than euploid control animals. More studies are needed to tease out further the potential effects of confounding factors on the performance of Ts65Dn mice.","The Ts65Dn mouse is the most studied and genetically the most complete animal model of Down syndrome (DS) available. These mice display many DS-like features, including performance deficits in different behavioral tasks, motor dysfunction, and age-dependent loss of cholinergic markers in the basal forebrain. At present, the only robust data demonstrating a behavioral deficit potentially associated with learning and memory in Ts65Dn mice less than 6 months old have come from studies that used some variation of the Morris water maze task. However, the specific features of the water maze deficits seen in these animals are still poorly defined.",This study is an initial attempt to bridge this knowledge gap. We investigated three major factors potentially influencing the performance of Ts65Dn mice in the water maze: (1) order in which the test is executed; (2) age of the animals; and (3) levels of aversiveness associated with the test. Measurements of plasma corticosterone levels and core body temperature after swimming were also carried out in additional subsets of mice.,"Overall, we found that the behavioral phenotype of Ts65Dn mice was milder than previously described in the literature. Additionally, Ts65Dn mice were significantly more responsive to potential stressors and more prone to swim-induced hypothermia than euploid control animals. More studies are needed to tease out further the potential effects of confounding factors on the performance of Ts65Dn mice.",1,1,1,"Overall, we found that the behavioral phenotype of Ts65Dn mice was more severe than previously described in the literature.

"The choice among behavioral options is influenced by the anticipated cost of working for the reward relative to the anticipated reward magnitude. Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been suggested to play an important role in cost/benefit computation. From a behavioral perspective, work involves two elements: the caloric expenditure of energy and the time required to complete the task. In many studies of the contribution of NAc dopamine to cost/benefit decisions, measures of work have conflated these separate elements. Here we describe a novel cued progressive delay task, an analog of the progressive ratio task that minimizes energy expenditure. In this task, rats obtain sucrose reward by entering a reward receptacle in response to a cue and remaining in the receptacle for a required wait that is increased after each successful trial. In an experiment in which the magnitude of reward was varied across sessions, the animals' fail point (maximum wait achieved) was correlated with the amount of reward delivered. Microinjection of D1 or D2 dopamine receptor antagonists into the NAc did not affect the length of time animals were willing to wait for reward (fail point), but did reduce the proportion of cues to which the animal responded. These results suggest that waiting for reward without increased caloric energy expenditure does not require NAc dopamine.","The choice among behavioral options is influenced by the anticipated cost of working for the reward relative to the anticipated reward magnitude.

"alpha-MSH is involved in reproductive processes and can regulate the expression of lordosis, an important component of female reproductive behavior in rats and many other species. In this study, we investigated the effects of MSH peptides on lordosis behavior when injected in medial preoptic area (POA) of ovariectomised rats primed with estradiol. The results show an increase in lordotic activity after bilateral administration of alpha-MSH and gamma-MSH. Interestingly, the treatment with the MC4 receptor antagonist HS014 did not block the stimulatory effect of alpha-MSH. Moreover, the injection of HS014 did not itself modify the lordosis quotient. Nitric oxide has been suggested to play a crucial role in the regulation of lordosis behavior via stimulation of guanylyl cyclase to synthesize cGMP. In order to determine the participation of NO in the effect of the melanocortins, another group of rats were treated with L-NAME, an inhibitor of NOS, alone or 15 min before the injection of alpha-MSH or gamma-MSH. The injection of L-NAME into the POA of E-primed rats 15 min before the test for sexual receptivity did not modify significantly the lordosis quotient at the two doses examined. The treatment with L-NAME at the lowest dose completely abolished the stimulatory effect of alpha-MSH and gamma-MSH on sexual behavior. The results indicate that the effects of MSH peptides on female sexual behavior in this area are mediated through specific MC receptor, that could be the MC3 receptor and that NO mediates the melanocortins effects.","alpha-MSH is involved in reproductive processes and can regulate the expression of lordosis, an important component of female reproductive behavior in rats and many other species.

"Previously we demonstrated Fos expression in the dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG) of the rat following cat odor exposure. Further work correlated the response to cat odor with a sustained blood pressure increase and deployment of defense behavior. It was therefore of interest to determine whether lesions of the DPAG would abolish these two effects of cat odor exposure. Male Wistar rats were given excitotoxic NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) lesions of the DPAG and anterior tectum under halothane, then implanted with blood pressure telemetric probes. Sham lesions were made with saline. Rats were then exposed to cat odor with a hide option, followed 2 weeks later by re-exposure to cat odor without a hide option. Controls were exposed to rat odor in the same way. Trends toward attenuation in defense and cardiovascular indices were found in lesioned rats for cat odor exposure with a hide option, but these were not significant. Re-exposure to cat fur without a hide option enhanced the cardiovascular response and under these conditions, lesioned rats showed a significant change of the heart rate and locomotor activity response to cat fur. However, the blood pressure response was not significantly attenuated. Thus, the present results support the Fos data and indicate that the DPAG is involved in the expression of some but not all of the cardiovascular and behavioral components of the response to cat odor.",Previously we demonstrated Fos expression in the dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG) of the rat following cat odor exposure.

"This study assessed the role of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) in specific memory phases of two-way active avoidance conditioning. We evaluated the effects of NBM electrical stimulation applied during different phases of the avoidance task. Rats were trained in a 30-trial acquisition session, and were tested again 24 and 48 h later. NBM stimulation was applied at different stages of memory formation of the conditioning: (1) immediately before the first training session to determine the effects on acquisition of the two-way avoidance task; (2) immediately after the first training session to evaluate effects on memory consolidation; and (3) immediately before the 24-h retention session to analyze the effects on the retrieval process. NBM stimulation before training significantly improved the acquisition of the task, without affecting subsequent retention at either 24 or 48 h. Stimulation of the NBM immediately after the first training session slightly impaired performance in the 24-h retention session. Stimulation of the NBM immediately before the 24-h retention session did not affect performance in either the 24 or 48-h retention sessions. Therefore, the NBM may play a more important role in acquisition of memory in aversively motivated conditioning tasks than in consolidation or retrieval of such memories. These results are discussed in the context of attention enhancement and cortical and amygdala activation.",This study assessed the role of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) in specific memory phases of two-way active avoidance conditioning.,"We evaluated the effects of NBM electrical stimulation applied during different phases of the avoidance task.

"The central serotonin (5-HT) system is important in regulating behaviors associated with anxiety and depression. While a fair amount is known about the role of 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor subtypes in regulating these behaviors, much less is known about the involvement of the 5-HT3 receptor, especially with regards to its role in sex differences in behavior. Our goal in the present studies was to examine whether deletion of the 5-HT3 receptor produces different effects in adult male and female mice on performance in three behavioral tests. We examined behavior of male and female mice lacking the 5-HT3 receptor (knock-out or KO) and their wild-type (WT) littermates in the Porsolt forced swim test because of its importance in reliably detecting anti-depressant efficacy. In addition, we examined behavior in the defensive withdrawal test and repeated exposure to an open field because behavior in these two tests provides measures of anxiety. In the Porsolt swim test, sex differences were eliminated by deletion of the 5-HT3 receptor while deletion had no effect in the habituation of locomotor activity to repeated exposure to an open field. In the defensive withdrawal test, deletion of the 5-HT3 receptor had more complex effects though these effects tended to be in the opposite direction in males and females. Together these results suggest that the 5-HT3 receptor regulates behavior-related to depression and anxiety differently in males and females. Whether these effects are due to the interaction of 5-HT3 receptor with gonadal hormones requires further examination.","The central serotonin (5-HT) system is important in regulating behaviors associated with anxiety and depression.

"Previous research in the rat has demonstrated that neonatal exposure to bacterial endotoxin alters the level of anxiety-like behaviour displayed in adulthood. Currently, however, little is known about the emergence and development of this type of behaviour. Given the ability of neonatal endotoxin exposure to alter neural substrates involved in regulating anxiety, we tested the hypothesis that it may also alter the developmental trajectory of anxiety-like behaviour in the rat. Male Fischer 344 neonatal rats were treated with endotoxin (0.05 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide from Salmonella enteriditis) or vehicle on postnatal days 3 and 5. Age related changes in anxiety-like behaviour were subsequently investigated using the elevated plus maze apparatus at three developmental time points; adolescence (43 days), adulthood (80 days) and senescence (400 days). Neonatal endotoxin exposure was found to significantly increase circulating levels of corticosterone on postnatal days 3 and 5 at 4 h postadministration (P &lt; 0.05). Additionally, endotoxin exposure was found to markedly alter anxiety-like behaviour in adulthood and senescence (P &lt; 0.05). Specifically, adult and senescent endotoxin treated animals displayed significantly more anxiety-like behaviour than vehicle treated controls. Interestingly no significant differences in anxiety-like behaviour were observed between treatment groups during adolescence. These findings highlight the importance of the early life microbial environment in the development of emotional behaviour and suggests that neonatal infection may be an important predictor of susceptibility to anxiety related disorders in adult life.","Previous research in the rat has demonstrated that neonatal exposure to bacterial endotoxin alters the level of anxiety-like behaviour displayed in adulthood.

"Pit vipers use infrared-sensitive pit organs to accurately target homeothermic prey even in the absence of visual cues. It has been suggested that other vipers, including large ambush predators of the genus Bitis, also may use radiant infrared information for predatory targeting. We compared behavioral responses of pit vipers and snakes of the viperine genus Bitis to paired targets of different temperatures (i.e. cool and warm balloons), some scented with rodent odors. The rates of tongue flicking, head turning and approaches by pit vipers (Agkistrodon contortrix and Crotalus atrox) were significantly higher toward warm targets than toward cool ones. Moreover, they all were significantly higher in pit vipers than in the vipers Bitis arietans, Bitis gabonica, and Bitis nasicornis. Bitis sp. exhibited no significant differences in their behaviors toward warm versus cool targets. Pit vipers often struck at targets (always the warm target even when paired with a prey-scented cool target), but Bitis sp. never struck at either warm or cool targets. These results show that the behavioral correlates of infrared-based predatory and/or defensive targeting differ significantly between these two groups of viperid snakes, and suggest that the neural substrates of infrared imaging in crotaline snakes are either absent or functionally distinct in viperine snakes of the genus Bitis.","Pit vipers use infrared-sensitive pit organs to accurately target homeothermic prey even in the absence of visual cues.

"Scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) are both progressive neurodegenerative diseases that are transmissible to mice. The onset of clinical symptoms is more subtle and variable in murine BSE than in murine scrapie. Assessment of behavioural changes that occur throughout disease would aid early diagnosis of disease so that more consistent end points could be made and potential therapies could be investigated. C57BL/6J mice inoculated via the intraperitoneal route with 301C BSE or control inoculum were monitored on a fortnightly basis. The end point was when a mouse showed clinical signs as opposed to behavioural signs of BSE for two consecutive observations. Significant loss of motor function, as assessed by mice balancing on a static rod, was observed consistently from approximately 40 days prior to death. No significant differences in home cage activity (locomotion, rearing) or cognitive function (T-maze alternation) were observed. However, there was an increase in digging by BSE-infected mice from an early stage. This data will aid the standardisation of behavioural tests to characterise and assess the onset of BSE.",Scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) are both progressive neurodegenerative diseases that are transmissible to mice.

"In the present study, we evaluated the search behavior of rats during a probe trial of a Morris water escape task. More specifically, the spatial memory during different stages of a 2 min probe trial in different zones was examined. After rats were trained for 4 days with four trials per day, their spatial memory was tested in a first probe trial. The rats showed a preference for the target quadrant during each of four 30-s intervals. The time in the annulus decreased across the four 30-s intervals. The preference for the previous target quadrant was also observed in a second probe trial, when the rats had received additional training for 4 days with four trials per day. However, the time spent in the annulus was highest during the first 30-s of the probe trial, and was lower and similar during the next three 30-s intervals. Therefore, probe trials of 60s seem to underestimate the spatial ability of rats. It appears that using a quadrant for assessing the performance may overestimate the spatial ability of a rat. Our findings suggest that the evaluation of the spatial memory of rats in a probe trial in the Morris water escape task requires a more detailed analysis.","In the present study, we evaluated the search behavior of rats during a probe trial of a Morris water escape task.

"Anatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral studies implicate extrastriate cortex as a major contributor to the sparing of visually guided behaviors following lesions of primary visual cortex incurred early in life. Here we report considerable sparing of the ability to detect and localize stimuli in the hemifield contralateral to unilateral early lesions of all contiguous visually-responsive primary and extrastriate cortical regions (occipital, visuoparietal, and visuotemporal cortices). In the adult cat this same lesion induces a dense blindness and cats are unable to orient to any visual stimulus introduced into the contralesional hemifield. In the absence of cortical circuits, the neural sparing identified following the neonatal lesion is based on the superior colliculus and it occurs despite massive retrograde transynaptic degeneration of large numbers of retinal ganglion cells.","Anatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral studies implicate extrastriate cortex as a major contributor to the sparing of visually guided behaviors following lesions of primary visual cortex incurred early in life.","Here we report considerable sparing of the ability to detect and localize stimuli in the hemifield contralateral to unilateral early lesions of all contiguous visually-responsive primary and extrastriate cortical regions (occipital, visuoparietal, and visuotemporal cortices).","In the adult cat this same lesion induces a dense blindness and cats are unable to orient to any visual stimulus introduced into the contralesional hemifield.

"In this study, the effects on memory of intraperitoneal post-training administration of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors, DC-TA 46 and rolipram, were tested using a visible/hidden-platform water maze task. The effects of these compounds on cyclic nucleotide levels in the hippocampal formation (HF) and striatum (CP) were also assessed, by enzymatic immunoassay (EIA). The results obtained from rats trained in the visible-platform task were not significantly different from controls. On the contrary, the animals trained in the hidden-platform water maze task showed a memory impairment, when injected with DC-TA 46 at maximal dose of 20mg/kg and with rolipram at 3 and 30 mg/kg doses. The effects of these drugs on cyclic nucleotide levels in HF and CP were observed at 30 min and at 24h after drug administration. Thirty minutes after drug injection, we observed an increase of cAMP level, both in HF and in CP. Twenty-four hours after the retention test, we observed that in CP the cAMP intracellular level remained high, while in the HF at effective doses both inhibitors induced cAMP PDE activity, determining a decrease of cyclic nucleotide. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, together with Western blot immunodetection, showed a mRNA and protein induction of PDE4D PDE isoforms, that may account for the increase of PDE activity observed. Our data suggest that, despite cyclic nucleotide increase at 30 min, the fundamental event causing memory impairment, came from the subsequent long time decrease of cAMP levels, due to the post-translational PDE4D induction.","In this study, the effects on memory of intraperitoneal post-training administration of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors, DC-TA 46 and rolipram, were tested using a visible/hidden-platform water maze task.

"The aim of this study was to investigate the differential long-term after-effects on the apomorphine-susceptibility in the apomorphine-susceptible (APO-SUS) and apomorphine-unsusceptible (APO-UNSUS) rats of either a saline injection (a mild stressor) or a clonidine-injection (a moderate stressor) applied around the onset of the stress-hypo-responsive-period (SHRP) on postnatal day (PND) 2, 4, 6 or 9. The present study shows that an injection of saline on PND 2 decreases the apomorphine-induced gnawing score in adult APO-SUS rats, but increases this score in adult APO-UNSUS rats; clonidine given on this day has no effect. An injection of saline on PND 4 decreases the apomorphine score in adult APO-SUS rats, but has no effect in adult APO-UNSUS rats. An injection of clonidine on PND 4 counteracts the long-term after-effects of a saline injection on this PND in adult APO-SUS rats, but has no effect in adult APO-UNSUS rats. Finally, an injection of clonidine on PND 9 has no effect on the apomorphine score in adult APO-SUS rats, but increases this score in adult APO-UNSUS rats; saline given on this day has no effect. It is concluded that the long-term after-effects of early postnatal stressors depend on the interrelationship between, rather than the separate impact of, the genetic background of the rat, the nature of the event, and time of exposure to the event, thereby implying that these factors direct the phenotypic expression of a particular genotype at adult age.","The aim of this study was to investigate the differential long-term after-effects on the apomorphine-susceptibility in the apomorphine-susceptible (APO-SUS) and apomorphine-unsusceptible (APO-UNSUS) rats of either a saline injection (a mild stressor) or a clonidine-injection (a moderate stressor) applied around the onset of the stress-hypo-responsive-period (SHRP) on postnatal day (PND) 2, 4, 6 or 9.",nan,"The present study shows that an injection of saline on PND 2 decreases the apomorphine-induced gnawing score in adult APO-SUS rats, but increases this score in adult APO-UNSUS rats; clonidine given on this day has no effect.

"This paper will review both new and old data that address the question of whether brain mechanisms involved in reproductive function act in a coordinated way to control female sexual behavior and the induction of pregnancy/pseudopregnancy (P/PSP) by vaginocervical stimulation. Although it is clear that female sexual behavior, including pacing behavior, is important for induction of P/PSP, there has been no concerted effort to examine whether or how common mechanisms may control both functions. Because initiation of P/PSP requires that the female receive vaginocervical stimulation, central mechanisms controlling P/PSP may be modulated by or interactive with those that control female sexual behavior. This paper presents a synthesis of the literature and recent data from our lab for the purpose of examining whether there are interactions between behavioral and neuroendocrine mechanisms which reciprocally influence both reproductive functions.","This paper will review both new and old data that address the question of whether brain mechanisms involved in reproductive function act in a coordinated way to control female sexual behavior and the induction of pregnancy/pseudopregnancy (P/PSP) by vaginocervical stimulation.

The results indicate that the coordinated activity of neuroendocrine pathways significantly enhances female sexual behavior, which is a prerequisite for the induction of P/PSP. However, contrary to previous beliefs, we found that these pathways actually have no effect on P/PSP induction, instead suggesting that peripheral factors unrelated to neuroendocrine activity might play a crucial role. This inverse outcome highlights the necessity for further research into the other contributing factors and mechanisms regulating these reproductive functions."
"Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) expression is associated with strong increases in Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) in a region of the brainstem identified as the parvicellular subdivision of the intermediate nucleus of the solitary tract (iNTSpc). To identify the projections to and from cells in iNTSpc which display strong FLI in response to expression of a CTA, anterograde and retrograde tract tracing was used. When appropriate, tract tracing was combined with double labeling for FLI in animals which received CTA training as well as tracer injections and were re-exposed to the CS taste. With respect to afferent projections, iNTSpc receives a strong, direct, ipsilateral projection from amygdala and the distribution of the fiber terminals yields a striking match to that of cells expressing FLI after CTA expression. As for efferent projections, these cells in iNTSpc are characterized by a mixed, rather than homogeneous, projection pattern. Targets of these cells include pons and forebrain as well as local medullary sites, all of which are known to be involved in gastrointestinal function. Thus, activation of these cells may provide a circuit through which gastrointestinal/visceral responses are coordinated as a component of the conditioned aversion.",Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) expression is associated with strong increases in Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) in a region of the brainstem identified as the parvicellular subdivision of the intermediate nucleus of the solitary tract (iNTSpc).,"To identify the projections to and from cells in iNTSpc which display strong FLI in response to expression of a CTA, anterograde and retrograde tract tracing was used.

"Cannabinoids have been shown to produce greater behavioral effects in female than in male rats. Sex differences in the metabolism of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) have also been demonstrated in one study. The goal of this study was to determine if sex differences in Delta(9)-THC disposition or metabolism could explain sex differences in Delta(9)-THC-induced behavioral effects. [(3)H]-Delta(9)-THC was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to rats and the presence of [(3)H]-Delta(9)-THC and metabolites in serum and brain tissue were compared at multiple times post-injection in male versus female rats. Serum levels of Delta(9)-THC and its metabolites were similar in males and females. In brain tissue, [(3)H]-Delta(9)-THC levels also were similar in males and females. In contrast, levels of Delta(9)-THC metabolites in brain tissue, including 11-hydroxy-Delta(9)-THC, the major active metabolite, were higher in females than in males. To further investigate if greater production of active metabolites by females explained the greater Delta(9)-THC-induced behavioral effects observed in females, i.p. Delta(9)-THC-induced antinociception (50 degrees C warm water tail withdrawal assay) and catalepsy (bar test) were compared in male and female rats following pretreatment with saline or SKF525A, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor.

"Age-associated cognitive impairment and related neurodegenerative disorders are an increasing major public health problem. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), a co-substrate for energy transfer in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, is speculated to induce positive effects in some of these diseases. Studies showed diminished mitochondrial function in patients with M. Alzheimer. In a preliminary clinical trial NADH given peripherally improved cognitive function in Alzheimer disease. Previous own experiments revealed an increased NADH level in the rat brain following peripheral application of NADH (10-100 mg/kg, i.p.+ i.v.). Therefore, we wanted to know, whether or not NADH has an effect on cognitive function in animals. We analysed the effect of repeated i.p. injection of NADH on the performance of 3-month-old and 22-month-old Wistar rats in the Morris water maze and in the rota-rod test of motor coordination. The rats were injected for 10 days once daily with the doses of NADH used in the bioavailability study (10-100 mg/kg) or vehicle 20 min before the behavioural tests. The repeated administration of NADH improved the performance of old rats in the acquisition phase (place version) and the spatial probe of the Morris water maze compared to vehicle-treated controls. The effect of NADH on learning-related processes is supported by the lack of effects on motor performance on the rota-rod. In summary, our results suggest cognitive enhancing properties of NADH in learning impaired old rats.","Age-associated cognitive impairment and related neurodegenerative disorders are an increasing major public health problem.

"The open field (OF) is thought to induce anxiety in rodents. It also allows an opportunity for exploration in a novel environment. Less activity in the OF is thought to indicate greater anxiety whereas more activity may reflect greater exploration, and possibly greater exploratory learning. Anxiety and learning have poorly understood relationships to sleep. In order to determine how anxiety and exploration in the OF could influence sleep, we recorded sleep in mouse strains (C57BL/6J (B6), BALB/cJ (C), DBA/2J (D2), and CB6F1/J (CB6)) with different levels of anxiety and exploration after 30 min in an OF. In all strains, OF exposure induced immediate decreases in rapid eye movement sleep (REM) followed by longer latency increases in REM. The time course and amount of REM decreases and increases varied among strains. Compared to less anxious B6, D2 and CB6 mice, C mice had greater and longer lasting immediate decreases in REM. C mice also displayed longer periods of decreases REM and a smaller, longer latency increase in REM. OF exploratory activity was positively correlated to percentage of REM increases from 6 to 10h after OF exposure. The results suggest that the anxiogenic component of the OF produced an immediate decrease in REM that was greater in more ""anxious"" mice. In contrast, exploration in the OF was associated with increased REM, with the increase greater in less anxious mice. The results are discussed with respect to the potential influences of anxiety and learning on sleep.","The open field (OF) is thought to induce anxiety in rodents.

"Leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) protein is a cell adhesion molecule-like receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase. We previously reported that in LAR tyrosine phosphatase-deficient (LAR-Delta P) mice the number and size of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons as well as their innervation of the hippocampal area was reduced. With the hippocampus being implicated in behavioural activity aspects, including learning and memory processes, we assessed possible phenotypic consequences of LAR phosphatase deficiency using a battery of rodent behaviour tests. Motor function and co-ordination tests as well as spatial learning ability assays did not reveal any performance differences between wildtype and LAR-Delta P mice. A spatial learning impairment was found in the difficult variant of the Morris water maze. Exploration, nestbuilding and activity tests indicated that LAR-Delta P mice were more active than wildtype littermates. The observed hyperactivity in LAR-Delta P mice could not be explained by altered anxiety or curiosity levels, and was found to be persistent throughout the nocturnal period. In conclusion, behavioural testing of the LAR-Delta P mice revealed a spatial learning impairment and a significant increase in activity.","Leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) protein is a cell adhesion molecule-like receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase.

"This study investigated whether application of acute restraint stress or dexamethasone, as a glucocorticoid receptor agonist, impaired retrieval of long-term memory and if pretreatment with opiate antagonist naloxone blocked their effects on memory retrieval. Young adult male rats were trained in one trial inhibitory avoidance task (1 mA, 1.5 s footshock). On retention test given 48 h after training, the latency to re-enter dark compartment of the apparatus was recorded. Thirty minutes before retention test, the rats were exposed to a 10 min of restraint stress in a Plexiglass tube or were injected with dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) with or without prior treatment of naloxone (1 or 2 mg/kg). The results showed that both acute restraint stress and dexamethasone impaired retention performance. Both doses of naloxone were effective in blocking the impairing effect of stress, but only higher dose of naloxone blocked dexamethasone-induced impairment. The applied stress increased circulating corticosterone levels as assessed immediately after the retention test, indicating that stress-induced impairment of memory retrieval is mediated, in part, by increased plasma levels of glucocorticoids. These findings further indicate that acute restraint stress and glucocorticoids impair retrieval of long-term memory, and provide evidence for the existence of an interaction between glucocortioids and opiate system on this process.","This study investigated whether application of acute restraint stress or dexamethasone, as a glucocorticoid receptor agonist, impaired retrieval of long-term memory and if pretreatment with opiate antagonist naloxone blocked their effects on memory retrieval.","Young adult male rats were trained in one trial inhibitory avoidance task (1 mA, 1.5 s footshock).

"Perinatal asphyxia may induce major neurological deficits shortly after birth as well as neurological/behavioural disorders later in development. We used a rat model of global perinatal asphyxia to model acute intrauterine asphyxia around the time of birth. Caesarean section was performed in rats and their pups, still in uterus horns, were placed into a water bath at 37 degrees C for periods of 0, 10 or 20 min. Pups were then given to surrogate mothers, and examined for long-term behavioural effects of the perinatal asphyctic insult. Behavioural assessment included analysis of novelty seeking behaviour at adolescence, while spatial discrimination abilities, response to both an acute and a chronic stress, and the effects of the full D1 receptor agonist SKF 82958 on open field behaviour were assessed at adulthood. Overall, no marked abnormalities were found in the novelty seeking test, in the ability to discriminate spatial changes in the test environment and in physiological response to stress. However, adult rats subjected to severe perinatal asphyxia (20 min) showed lower activity level and lower stereotyped behaviour after the administration of SKF 82958 in an open field test. These results support the observations from human and animal studies that perinatal insult can produce long-term dysfunction of dopaminergic neurotransmission, and points to the need of more thorough examination of the potential effects of perinatal asphyxia on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.

"Early life adverse experiences have been shown to increase the likelihood of developing later depressive symptoms. In this frame, human adolescents have been suggested to approach psychoactive drugs in order to self-medicate emerging depressive states. In keeping with these considerations, outbred CD-1 mice of both sexes, which underwent a single 24-h episode of maternal deprivation early in development, were administered the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 (0, 0.5 or 2 mg/kg i.p.) during adolescence. Maternal deprivation reduced the expected interest in socio-sexual interaction with peers during adolescence. When mice were then tested at adulthood in the forced-swim paradigm in drug-free state, the latency to reach a passive floating posture was markedly reduced by early maternal deprivation. Low doses of cannabinoid (0.5 mg/kg) administered during adolescence were either able to reduce the time spent floating and to increase episodes of active struggling only in control non-deprived animals. As a whole, the emergence of depressive symptoms during both adolescence and adulthood seems to be eased as a consequence of a single/prolonged episode of early maternal deprivation early in infancy.","Early life adverse experiences have been shown to increase the likelihood of developing later depressive symptoms.

"The present studies determined whether blockade of M(1)-like muscarinic or nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the dorsomedial striatum affects acquisition or reversal learning of a response discrimination. Testing occurred in a modified cross-maze across two consecutive sessions. In the acquisition phase, a rat learned to turn to the left or to the right. In the reversal learning phase, a rat learned to turn in the opposite direction as required during acquisition. Experiment 1 investigated the effects of the M(1)-like muscarinic receptor antagonist, pirenzepine infused into the dorsomedial striatum on acquisition and reversal learning. Experiment 2 examined the effects of the nicotinic cholinergic antagonist, mecamylamine injected into the dorsomedial striatum on acquisition and reversal learning. Bilateral injections of pirenzepine at 10 microg, but not 1 microg, selectively impaired reversal learning. Analysis of the errors indicated that pirenzepine treatment did not impair the initial shift, but increased reversions back to the original response choice following the initial shift. Bilateral injections of mecamylamine, 6 or 18 microg, did not affect acquisition or reversal learning.

"Central administration of angiotensin IV (Ang IV) analogues attenuates scopolamine-induced amnesia. Ang IV mediates its effects by binding to a high affinity, binding site, AT(4) receptor, that has recently been identified as insulin regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP). The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the distinct AT(4) ligand, LVV-hemorphin-7 (LVV-H7), on scopolamine-induced learning deficits, one which involves fear-conditioning and the other spatial learning. Rats were pretreated with an intracerebroventricular (ICV) dose of scopolamine hydrobromide followed by treatment with 1 nmol LVV-H7 or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). During the acquisition phase of the water maze task, daily ICV infusions of 1 nmol of LVV-H7 25 min after scopolamine treatment produced marked improvement in both the latency and distance swum in order to locate the submerged platform using visual cues compared to animals treated with scopolamine only. In addition, the same dose of LVV-H7 attenuated the learning deficit observed for scopolamine-treated animals in the passive avoidance task. These studies clearly demonstrate that LVV-H7, like Ang IV, is a pharmacologically active AT(4) ligand that attenuates the deleterious effects of scopolamine on learning performance in two different behavioral paradigms.","Central administration of angiotensin IV (Ang IV) analogues attenuates scopolamine-induced amnesia.

"Yawning, a phylogenetic behavior, present in reptiles, birds and mammals, has been studied for several decades, but to date its physiological function is still unknown. The role of stress as well as several peptides and the hypothalamus has been studied in relation to its regulation. To date however, no studies has been carried out to determine the role of the adrenal glands. Therefore, yawning behavior was studied in adrenalectomized rats, who then received dexamethasone replacement. The results show that rats whose adrenal glands were removed stopped both spontaneous and apomorphine-induced yawning, while dexamethasone reverted this effect. The results are discussed in terms of the possible role of corticosterone on yawning behavior.","Yawning, a phylogenetic behavior, present in reptiles, birds and mammals, has been studied for several decades, but to date its physiological function is still unknown.

"Newborn humans are known to show specific facial expressions in response to various kinds of taste stimuli and are presumed to be able to discriminate those kinds of tastes from just after birth. As the closest relatives to humans, the taste reactivity (threshold, preference and taste-elicited facial expression) of non-human primates has long been of great interest. To date, however, there have been few investigations in newborn non-human primates. In the present study, we investigated the facial expressions elicited in response to four basic taste stimuli, sweet, salty, sour and bitter, in the newborns of two non-human primate species, rhesus macaques and chimpanzees. The taste-elicited facial expressions were compared among the kinds of taste stimuli and between the two species. Rhesus macaques of less than 7 days old showed different patterns of facial expressions for water/sweet than for bitter, and chimpanzees less than 30 days old did so for sweet and bitter. The differences between these two species were evident in the presence and absence of certain facial expressions and the emerging patterns of certain components for each stimulus. In particular, chimpanzee response patterns to the bitter stimulus resembled to those of humans rather than rhesus macaques. Overall, rhesus macaques and chimpanzees responded differently to the same kinds of tastes, presumably reflecting differences in their evolutionary backgrounds.","Newborn humans are known to show specific facial expressions in response to various kinds of taste stimuli and are presumed to be able to discriminate those kinds of tastes from just after birth.

"BC1 RNA is a small non-messenger RNA common in dendritic microdomains of neurons in rodents. In order to investigate its possible role in learning and behaviour, we compared controls and knockout mice from three independent founder lines established from separate embryonic stem cells. Mutant mice were healthy with normal brain morphology and appeared to have no neurological deficits. A series of tests for exploration and spatial memory was carried out in three different laboratories. The tests were chosen as to ensure that different aspects of spatial memory and exploration could be separated and that possible effects of confounding variables could be minimised. Exploration was studied in a barrier test, in an open-field test, and in an elevated plus-maze test. Spatial memory was investigated in a Barnes maze and in a Morris water maze (memory for a single location), in a multiple T-maze and in a complex alley maze (route learning), and in a radial maze (working memory). In addition to these laboratory tasks, exploratory behaviour and spatial memory were assessed under semi-naturalistic conditions in a large outdoor pen. The combined results indicate that BC1 RNA-deficient animals show behavioural changes best interpreted in terms of reduced exploration and increased anxiety. In contrast, spatial memory was not affected. In the outdoor pen, the survival rates of BC1-depleted mice were lower than in controls. Thus, we conclude that the neuron-specific non-messenger BC1 RNA contributes to the aptive modulation of behaviour.","BC1 RNA is a small non-messenger RNA common in dendritic microdomains of neurons in rodents.

"This study assessed freezing behaviour and cardiovascular responses during the expression of latent inhibition of conditioned fear. Animals that were either repeatedly preexposed (PE) to a tone conditioned stimulus (CS) or naive to the tone (non-preexposed; NPE) subsequently experienced three presentations of the tone paired with footshock. Animals were tested 24 h later in the context of the footshock chamber, and on the following day, in the presence of the tone CS. Changes in heart rate and blood pressure were recorded by radio-telemetry. The PE rats spent more time freezing to the conditioned contextual cues and exhibited higher blood pressures during the last half of the context test session than did the NPE animals. During the tone test, the PE rats exhibited less conditioned freezing to the tone CS compared with the NPE animals, i.e. expression of the latent inhibition. This behavioural effect was associated with a significant increase in heart rate, but not blood pressure, in the PE but not the NPE animals. Our results suggest that the increased blood pressures of the PE rats during the context test directly reflect their greater fear of the conditioning context. In contrast, the increased heart rate response but decreased freezing shown by PE rats in response to the tone CS may be due to the fact that lower stress levels (e.g. PE condition) elicit sympathetically-mediated increases in heart rate, whereas higher stress levels (e.g. NPE condition) activate both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, thus eliminating any CS-induced increase in heart rate in the NPE rats.",This study assessed freezing behaviour and cardiovascular responses during the expression of latent inhibition of conditioned fear.,"Animals that were either repeatedly preexposed (PE) to a tone conditioned stimulus (CS) or naive to the tone (non-preexposed; NPE) subsequently experienced three presentations of the tone paired with footshock.

"In the literature, there is some evidence indicating that H3 histamine receptor antagonists, in particular thioperamide, can facilitate learning and memory retrieval in laboratory rodents. The present study aimed at verifying whether this also holds for memory consolidation, a phase of memory for which there is scarcity of convincing data on the effects of H3 receptor antagonists given systemically. To that end, memory consolidation was assessed in C57BL/6J mice using the one-trial step-through inhibitory avoidance task, the compounds being injected immediately after training (foot-shock) and performance measured 24 h later. More specifically, the following effects of thioperamide (1.25-20 mg/kg) were dose-dependently analysed: (1) its potential direct effects on memory consolidation; (2) its potential reversing effects on retrograde amnesia induced by the NMDA antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801, 0.5 mg/kg) and (3) its potential reversing effects on the well-known amnesia induced by the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (0.25 mg/kg). We found that thioperamide exerted a dose-dependent facilitative effect on memory consolidation. Furthermore, the H3 receptor antagonist reversed scopolamine- and especially dizocilpine-induced amnesia. The results strongly support the view that the brain mechanisms of memory consolidation involve a functional interaction between the NMDA and the H3 sites.","In the literature, there is some evidence indicating that H3 histamine receptor antagonists, in particular thioperamide, can facilitate learning and memory retrieval in laboratory rodents.

"The aim of our study was to analyse the components of visual lateralization in pigeon homing, a large-scale spatial task. In a series of 13 releases, birds were tested as binocular controls or monocularly with the right or left-eye covered. Occlusion of either eye had a significant effect on initial orientation and homing performance. Vanishing bearings were deflected to the side of the open eye, vanishing intervals were longer, and homing speed was reduced. These parameters were affected to a different degree. Initial orientation was markedly lateralized, with birds using their right-eye deviating less from the mean of control birds and showing significantly less variance. One minute after release, the deviation and variance were similarly large in both monocular groups. However, while the right-eyed birds improved their performance until leaving the release site, the left-eyed birds failed to do so. Vanishing intervals were similar in both monocular groups, but homing speed was reduced to a lesser extent in pigeons using the right-eye. The degree of lateralization varied across different releases, but superiority of the right-eye/left hemisphere prevailed. Lateralization did not depend on familiarity with the release site. This suggests that the crucial processes involved the eyes, but did not depend on visual memory of landscape features at the release site. Results reveal, for the first time, asymmetries of directional orientation as an essential component of lateralized homing performance. As likely mechanisms we suggest hemispheric differences in magnetic compass orientation and in the adjustment to optic flow.","The aim of our study was to analyse the components of visual lateralization in pigeon homing, a large-scale spatial task.","In a series of 13 releases, birds were tested as binocular controls or monocularly with the right or left-eye covered.","Occlusion of either eye had a significant effect on initial orientation and homing performance.

"Newborn mammals, showing reduced normal body temperature, might be protected against iron-mediated, delayed neurotoxicity of perinatal asphyxia. Therefore, we investigated the effects of (1) neonatal body temperature and neonatal critical anoxia as well as (2) postanoxic chelation of iron with deferoxamine, on open-field stress-induced behaviour in juvenile rats. The third aim of this study was to compare (after the above-mentioned treatments) circadian changes in spontaneous motor activity and body temperature in juvenile rats permanently protected from any stress. Neonatal anoxia at body temperature adjusted (both during anoxia and 2 h reoxygenation) to a level typical of healthy (37 degrees C) or febrile (39 degrees C) adults led to the stress-induced hyperactivity in juvenile (5-45 days old) rats. Both normal neonatal body temperature of 33 degrees C and chelation of iron prevented the hyperactivity in rats. Neither neonatal body temperature nor neonatal anoxia affected spontaneous motor activity or body temperature of juvenile rats, recorded in their home-cages with implantable transmitters. Circadian rhythmicity was also undisturbed.

"Prepulse inhibition is modulated by dopaminergic drugs and is disrupted in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) have been proposed as an animal model of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and show marked alterations of dopaminergic regulation of behaviour. SHR showed significantly lower startle amplitude than Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, but no difference in startle habituation. Baseline percentage prepulse inhibition was higher in SHR and WKY rats than in SD rats. Treatment with amphetamine caused significant disruption of prepulse inhibition in SHR and WKY rats, but not SD rats. In contrast, treatment with apomorphine caused prepulse-dependent disruption of prepulse inhibition in SD rats only. Both MK-801 and 8-OH-DPAT treatment caused disruption of prepulse inhibition in all three rat strains. This study shows differential changes in startle level and prepulse inhibition in SHR, however these rats are not uniformly different from either WKY rats or SD rats and WKY rats differ in a number of respects from SD rats. In conclusion, these data further reveal altered dopaminergic regulation of behaviour in SHR, but also shows that caution is needed about the control strain used to compare these animals with.","Prepulse inhibition is modulated by dopaminergic drugs and is disrupted in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as mental illnesses such as schizophrenia.

"In the present work, we investigated the short- and long-term effects of a single systemic injection of rat recombinant interleukin-2 on weight, food intake, and brain stimulation reward thresholds elicited from the ventral tegmental area. An inverted U-shaped dose-function was obtained with 0.5 microg producing the greatest increases in the threshold for rewarding brain stimulation which were sustained during the month long tests. No differences between groups in terms of maximum response rates, a measure of performance, were observed. Although all injected groups showed a minor decline in the rate of weight gain over time, percent efficiency of food utilization (percent weight gain/food intake) was the same across groups, suggesting that metabolic function was not affected by the cytokine. In animals with bilateral ventral tegmental area implants, there was no consistent correspondence between the threshold change obtained from ipsilateral stimulation and that associated with the contralateral site; side-to-side differences ranged from 0 to 100%, suggesting a specific interaction between cytokine activity and the locus of rewarding brain stimulation. These data suggest that peripheral IL-2 significantly modifies hedonic processes arising from medial forebrain bundle stimulation in a long-term manner. We further suggest that since this modulation appears to be notably site-specific, IL-2 receptors or its metabolites may not be evenly distributed within the medial forebrain bundle.","In the present work, we investigated the short- and long-term effects of a single systemic injection of rat recombinant interleukin-2 on weight, food intake, and brain stimulation reward thresholds elicited from the ventral tegmental area.","An inverted U-shaped dose-function was obtained with 0.5 microg producing the greatest increases in the threshold for rewarding brain stimulation which were sustained during the month long tests.

"Differential reward outcome learning provides a unique reward outcome for each condition of a conditional discrimination task, and this increases the rate at which these tasks can be learned. The present experiment aims to show that irrespective of any difference in learning rate, conditional discrimination tasks and differential reward outcome tasks are solved using different strategies. Two groups of 30 adult subjects were taught a series of conditional visual discriminations. One group received different reward outcomes for each condition, whilst the other group received the same reward outcome for each condition. Both groups learned the visual discriminations at the same rate. Subjects were then taught a new conditional cue with a subset of previously learnt discrimination problems and then required to transfer the newly learnt instruction cue to the remaining discrimination problems that had been previously learnt. Although both groups appeared to transfer the newly learnt cue at the same rate, the subjects performing the differential reward outcome task learnt to a criterion level of performance with fewer errors. The results are discussed in relation to evidence from monkeys indicating different neural mechanisms underlying the learning of both tasks.","Differential reward outcome learning provides a unique reward outcome for each condition of a conditional discrimination task, and this increases the rate at which these tasks can be learned.

Subjects were then taught a new conditional cue with a subset of previously learnt discrimination problems and then required to transfer the newly learnt instruction cue to the remaining discrimination problems that had been previously learnt. Although both groups appeared to transfer the newly learnt cue at the same rate, the subjects performing the differential reward outcome task learnt to a criterion level of performance with fewer errors. The results are discussed in relation to evidence from monkeys indicating different neural mechanisms underlying the learning of both tasks.",1,1,1,"Both groups learned the visual discriminations at the same rate.

"We studied the involvement of hippocampal protein synthesis-, PKA-, and MAP kinase-dependent processes in short- (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) for inhibitory avoidance task. Fifteen minutes before or immediately after training rats received intrahippocampal infusions of vehicle, the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin, the PKA inhibitor Rp-cAMPs or the MAPKK inhibitor PD098059. The results show that STM recruits PKA and MAPK, whereas, LTM depends on PKA activity and protein synthesis during the early post-training period.","We studied the involvement of hippocampal protein synthesis-, PKA-, and MAP kinase-dependent processes in short- (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) for inhibitory avoidance task.","Fifteen minutes before or immediately after training rats received intrahippocampal infusions of vehicle, the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin, the PKA inhibitor Rp-cAMPs or the MAPKK inhibitor PD098059.","The results show that STM recruits PKA and MAPK, whereas, LTM depends on PKA activity and protein synthesis during the early post-training period.",1,1,1,"The results demonstrate that STM recruits PKA and MAPK, whereas, LTM depends on MAPK activity and protein synthesis during the early post-training period."
"Noradrenaline, not only functions as a synaptic transmitter, but also promotes neural differentiation and regenerative processes. In Parkinson's disease, besides the dopaminergic degeneration, noradrenergic neurons of locus coeruleus origin degenerate as well. Drugs enhancing noradrenergic transmission in the locus coeruleus (e.g. alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonists) have been shown to be neuroprotective against Huntington's and ischemic animal models. However, in Parkinsonian animal models, most of the studies evaluated the worsening of experimental nigral neurodegeneration after locus coeruleus lesions. Here, it has been tested, whether treatment with the selective alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, 2-methoxy idazoxan (2.5 mg/kg i.p., twice daily for 5 days), before an experimental lesion to nigra, protects dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Dopaminergic degeneration was produced by 6-hydroxydopamine lesion in the median forebrain bundle. The concentrations of dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine and its metabolites were analysed in the various regions of the basal ganglia. The concentrations of noradrenaline and dopamine were measured in the regions innervated by locus coeruleus neurons and in the basal ganglia respectively, after 2-methoxy idazoxan treatment. The Parkinsonian behavior was assessed by catalepsy and activity test. 2-Methoxy idazoxan specifically increased the concentration of noradrenaline in the brain regions, innervated by locus coeruleus neurons. 6-OHDA lesion strongly depleted the concentration of dopamine and its metabolites in the striatum and SN, producing catalepsy and hypoactivity. Multiple treatments with 2-methoxy idazoxan reduced some of the observed neurochemical and behavioral indices of 6-hydroxydopamine-induced Parkinsonism, indicating neuroprotection. Although the mechanism underlying the neuroprotective property remains elusive, the therapeutic usage of alpha2-antagonists might be helpful in slowing the neuronal death and progression of Parkinson's disease.","Noradrenaline, not only functions as a synaptic transmitter, but also promotes neural differentiation and regenerative processes.

"This experiment investigated the involvement of the dorsal hippocampal CA3-region in the different phases of learning and memory in spatial and non-spatial tasks. To do so, we temporarily inactivated the CA3-subfield by a focal injection of diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) which chelates most of the heavy metals present in this region. The effects of temporary inactivation of the CA3-region were examined in an associative task, the Morris water maze (MWM). To study the different phase of memory we used a new behavioural massed-procedure founded on four massed training sessions in the spatial and the non-spatial (cue) version of this task. In the spatial version, we showed that a bilateral injection of DDC into the CA3-region impairs the acquisition but not the recall of spatial information. The main result of this study is that the same injection performed immediately after the training session also perturbed memory consolidation. In the cue version of the MWM, we found no difference between the DDC-injected mice and their controls in acquisition or memory consolidation of non-spatial information. These results suggest that the hippocampal CA3-region is essential for spatial memory processes and specifically in memory consolidation of spatial information.",This experiment investigated the involvement of the dorsal hippocampal CA3-region in the different phases of learning and memory in spatial and non-spatial tasks.,"To do so, we temporarily inactivated the CA3-subfield by a focal injection of diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) which chelates most of the heavy metals present in this region.

"In Parkinson's disease (PD) compensatory mechanisms such as an increase of the de novo biosynthesis of dopamine (DA) are thought to delay the onset of motor impairment. Here, we investigated whether the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) inhibitor alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (AMPT) affects behavioral deficits in the running wheel activity induced by the selective dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Immediately after MPTP treatment C57bl/6 mice showed reduced running wheel activity which lasted during the entire active phase (20:00 to 08:00 h), recovered to baseline levels in the following 2 days and remained stable up to the end of the experiment. AMPT challenge significantly reduced wheel running activity in MPTP-treated mice in the first 3 h after treatment. Post mortem HPLC analysis detected mean striatal DA levels in saline + saline and saline + AMPT-treated mice of 14.32 and 9.83 ng/mg, respectively and in MPTP + saline and MPTP + AMPT-treated mice of 1.73 and 0.69 ng/mg, respectively. Taken together, de novo biosynthesis of DA is a crucial component of the compensatory mechanisms which contributes to masking long-term behavioral deficits in the MPTP mouse model. Additionally, wheel running activity might provide a useful tool to study MPTP-induced behavioral deficits, shifts in circadian rhythmicity, and further compensatory mechanisms relevant to PD.",In Parkinson's disease (PD) compensatory mechanisms such as an increase of the de novo biosynthesis of dopamine (DA) are thought to delay the onset of motor impairment.,"Here, we investigated whether the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) inhibitor alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (AMPT) affects behavioral deficits in the running wheel activity induced by the selective dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).

"The neurobehavioral dissociation between place navigation and cued navigation has been central to contemporary thinking regarding the psychological processes involved in spatial behavior. In cases where locale (place) cues and taxon cues (e.g., beacons) are present it has been suggested that navigation may be controlled by either stimulus type in isolation, or, alternatively, by both simultaneously. In this report we provide evidence that place cues and beacons sequentially control navigation during a single trip to a visible goal. Rats were trained to navigate to a visible escape platform in a circular swimming pool surrounded by numerous visual cues and the kinematics and accuracy of the trajectories to the platform were analyzed. Shortly after initiating a trajectory to the visible platform, animals routinely engaged in stimulus sampling behaviors (e.g., horizontal head scans) which were consistently associated with changes in accuracy (heading error) and swim velocity. Subsequently, animals swam quickly and accurately to the visible platform suggesting that the sampling behaviors correspond to a shift in exteroceptive stimulus control. Consistent with this idea, removal or relocation of the platform disrupted navigation following the stimulus sampling behaviors, whereas the initial trajectory was unaffected. In contrast, changes in the distal cue constellation selectively disrupted the initial trajectory. The results showing that navigation to a visible goal is controlled sequentially by locale and taxon cues are discussed in relation to contemporary theories of navigation.","The neurobehavioral dissociation between place navigation and cued navigation has been central to contemporary thinking regarding the psychological processes involved in spatial behavior.

"Rats with entorhinal cortex lesions were trained in two versions of the place navigation task in the Morris water maze. In the distal condition, they had to locate the hidden platform on the basis of remote landmarks, while in the proximal condition, they had to rely only on a configuration of proximal objects, placed directly in the pool. Entorhinal rats were impaired in using distal landmarks but were able to use proximal landmarks to navigate toward the platform. These results suggest that the use of distal and proximal landmarks during navigation involves activation of different neural structures. They also suggest, in agreement with previous data, that there are two distinct landmark-processing systems, one devoted to the processing of proximal landmarks and the other to the processing of distal landmarks.",Rats with entorhinal cortex lesions were trained in two versions of the place navigation task in the Morris water maze.,"In the distal condition, they had to locate the hidden platform on the basis of remote landmarks, while in the proximal condition, they had to rely only on a configuration of proximal objects, placed directly in the pool.","Entorhinal rats were impaired in using distal landmarks but were able to use proximal landmarks to navigate toward the platform.

"There is evidence that histamine H3 receptors co-localise with dopamine D1 receptors on the terminals of striato-nigral neurones. In this work we studied the effect of the local activation of H3 receptors present in substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) on turning behaviour following apomorphine administration to either naive or hemiparkinsonian rats. In naive rats the intranigral (SNr) injection of the H3 receptor agonist immepip (3.2 or 32 ng/1 microl) resulted in ipsilateral turning following systemic apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg, subcutaneous). The effect of immepip was related to the dose and prevented by the H3 antagonist thioperamide (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). Conversely, in rats with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions to either substantia nigra pars compacta or the medial forebrain bundle (mfb), apomorphine-induced contralateral turning was reduced by intranigral immepip, an effect prevented by systemic thioperamide. Our data show that H3 receptors present in SNr regulate the synaptic output of the basal ganglia, most likely by reducing GABA release from striato-nigral terminals. These results may be relevant for the understanding of the role of histamine and H3 receptors in the control of motor behaviour both in normal and pathophysiological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease in which histaminergic innervation and histamine levels in substantia nigra have been shown to increase.",There is evidence that histamine H3 receptors co-localise with dopamine D1 receptors on the terminals of striato-nigral neurones.,"In this work we studied the effect of the local activation of H3 receptors present in substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) on turning behaviour following apomorphine administration to either naive or hemiparkinsonian rats.

"Guanosine has been shown to modulate glutamate system by stimulating astrocytic glutamate uptake. Recent evidence suggest that the locomotor effects of NMDA receptor antagonists, an animal model of schizophrenia, is associated with activation of non-NMDA glutamatergic receptors caused by increased glutamate release. The present work was undertaken to evaluate whether guanosine could have influence on the hyperlocomotion induced in mice by dizocilpine (MK-801), a NMDA antagonist. We also evaluated the effect of guanosine on the hyperlocomotion induced by the indirect dopamine agonist amphetamine, and by the non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine. Guanosine (7.5 mg/kg) produced an attenuation of about 60% on the hyperlocomotion induced by dizocilpine (0.25 mg/kg), whereas it did not affect the hyperlocomotion induced by amphetamine (5 mg/kg) or caffeine (30 mg/kg). Guanosine pre-treatment did not affect total spontaneous locomotion in all experiments. To test neuronal pathway selectivity, we evaluated MK-801 against guanosine in a working memory paradigm (spontaneous alternation task). Guanosine did not reverted the impairment caused by MK-801 in the spontaneous alternation test, and when administered alone also presented an amnesic effect. The results are discussed based on the current hypothesis of locomotor activation induced by the psychoactive drugs studied. Further studies are necessary to evaluate if guanosine could have clinical utility for the treatment of schizophrenia.","Guanosine has been shown to modulate glutamate system by stimulating astrocytic glutamate uptake.

The present experiment examined the individual and combined effects of systemic injection and oral ingestion of lithium chloride (LiCl) on both within and across session shifts in palatability. Male rats fitted with intraoral cannulae received two conditioning days in which they were injected with either LiCl or sodium chloride (NaCl) and were then presented with brief intraoral infusions of a sucrose plus LiCl or NaCl solution. The individual taste reactivity responses during the intraoral infusions were videotaped and later analyzed for response frequency. Forty-eight hours after the second conditioning day the same sucrose plus salt solution was presented again in the absence of any injection. The present results demonstrate that systemic injections of LiCl result in profound within session and across session decreases in ingestive responding accompanied by increased active and passive aversive responses. Animals receiving LiCl by injection as well as ingestion demonstrated an exaggerated response. Rats which received LiCl only through intraoral infusions produced the same pattern of decreased ingestive responding to the sucrose plus salt flavored tastant on each test trial suggesting little or no across session conditioning effects. A two process model by which animals may regulate toxicosis is discussed.,The present experiment examined the individual and combined effects of systemic injection and oral ingestion of lithium chloride (LiCl) on both within and across session shifts in palatability.,Male rats fitted with intraoral cannulae received two conditioning days in which they were injected with either LiCl or sodium chloride (NaCl) and were then presented with brief intraoral infusions of a sucrose plus LiCl or NaCl solution.

"In this study, we tested the ability of risk assessment and exploration behaviours to emphasise PH effects. Indeed, postnatal handling (PH) decreases emotional reactivity in rats but inconsistent behavioural results can be observed and may be due to false negative (i.e. existing effects are not detected). Risk assessment behaviours were measured in the elevated plus maze, in the free exploration paradigm and in the open field. In addition, we measured object exploration behaviours towards familiar/new objects in the open field. PH increased general activity in the elevated plus maze and in the free exploration paradigm and risk assessment behaviours allowed demonstrating that these effects were specific to emotional reactivity. In the open field, PH increased object exploration as early as first exposition while general activity was unaffected. PH also decreased behavioural inhibition in response to the introduction of a novel object. On the whole, our results show that risk assessment and object exploration behaviours are valuable tools to measure more precisely emotional reactivity in rodents. This reinforces the idea that these behaviours should be used more frequently in order to avoid false negative when emotional reactivity changes are expected in unconditioned conflict tests.","Indeed, postnatal handling (PH) decreases emotional reactivity in rats but inconsistent behavioural results can be observed and may be due to false negative (i.e. existing effects are not detected).","Risk assessment behaviours were measured in the elevated plus maze, in the free exploration paradigm and in the open field.

"We have previously observed that a single exposure to immobilization (IMO), a severe stressor, caused long-term (days to weeks) desensitization of the response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to the homotypic stressor, with no changes in behavioral reactivity to novel environments. In contrast, other laboratories have reported that a single exposure to footshock induced a long-term sensitization of both HPA and behavioral responses to novel environments. To test whether these apparent discrepancies can be explained by the use of different stressors or different strains of rats, we studied in the present work the long-term effects of a single exposure to two different stressors (footshock or IMO) in two different strains of rats (Sprague-Dawley from Iffa-Credo and Wistar rats from Harlan). We found that both strains showed desensitization of the HPA response to the same (homotypic) stressor after a previous exposure to either shock or IMO. The long-term effects were higher after IMO than shock. No major changes in behavior in two novel environments (circular corridor, CC and elevated plus-maze, EPM) were observed after a single exposure to shock or IMO in neither strain, despite the fact that shocked rats showed a conditioned freezing response to the shock boxes. The present results demonstrate that long-term stress-induced desensitization of the HPA axis is a reliable phenomenon that can be observed with different stressors and strains. However, only behavioral changes related to shock-induced conditioned fear were found, which suggests that so far poorly characterized factors are determining the long-term behavioral consequences of a single exposure to stress.","We have previously observed that a single exposure to immobilization (IMO), a severe stressor, caused long-term (days to weeks) desensitization of the response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to the homotypic stressor, with no changes in behavioral reactivity to novel environments.

"Parkinson's disease (PD) is marked by characterised motor deficits and is accompanied by a severe degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) pathway. It has also been reported that PD patients exhibited additional behavioural deficits, including a deficiency in sensorimotor gating mechanisms. We therefore examined whether the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of PD in mice could lead to a sensorimotor gating deficit in the prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response (ASR) paradigm. Two MPTP treatment schedules were separately examined here in male C57BL/6 mice. Post-mortem HPLC analysis confirmed that they were effective in depleting DA in the dorsal striatum (75-88%). PPI was evaluated on days 2, 9 and 16 after the last MPTP treatment; spontaneous locomotor activity was assessed 24 h before each PPI test. No significant change in the expression of PPI was detected across the three time points. On the other hand, the MPTP treatment reduced activity on post-treatment day 1. This effect subsided on post-treatment day 8, and was reversed on day 15. The possibility remains therefore that the reported sensorimotor gating deficits in PD patients might stem from structural or neurochemical aberrations beyond those induced by MPTP treatment.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is marked by characterised motor deficits and is accompanied by a severe degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) pathway.

Two MPTP treatment schedules were separately examined here in male C57BL/6 mice. Post-mortem HPLC analysis confirmed that they were effective in depleting DA in the dorsal striatum (75-88%). PPI was evaluated on days 2, 9 and 16 after the last MPTP treatment; spontaneous locomotor activity was assessed 24 h before each PPI test.","No significant change in the expression of PPI was detected across the three time points. On the other hand, the MPTP treatment reduced activity on post-treatment day 1. This effect subsided on post-treatment day 8, and was reversed on day 15. The possibility remains therefore that the reported sensorimotor gating deficits in PD patients might stem from structural or neurochemical aberrations beyond those induced by MPTP treatment.",1,1,1,"No significant change in the expression of PPI was detected across the three time points.

"We recently generated a sodium sulphate cotransporter knock-out mouse (Nas1-/-) which has increased urinary sulphate excretion and hyposulphataemia. To examine the consequences of disturbed sulphate homeostasis in the modulation of mouse behavioural characteristics, Nas1-/- mice were compared with Nas1+/- and Nas1+/+ littermates in a series of behavioural tests. The Nas1-/- mice displayed significantly (P &lt; 0.001) decreased marble burying behaviour (4.33 +/- 0.82 buried) when compared to Nas1+/+ (7.86 +/- 0.44) and Nas1+/- (8.40 +/- 0.37) animals, suggesting that Nas1-/- mice may have decreased object-induced anxiety. The Nas1-/- mice also displayed decreased locomotor activity by moving less distance (1.53 +/- 0.27 m, P &lt; 0.05) in an open-field test when compared to Nas1+/+ (2.31 +/- 0.24 m) and Nas1+/- (2.15 +/- 0.19 m) mice. The three genotypes displayed similar spatiotemporal and ethological behaviours in the elevated-plus maze and open-field test, with the exception of a decreased defecation frequency by the Nas1-/- mice (40% reduction, P &lt; 0.01). There were no significant differences between Nas1-/- and Nas1+/+ mice in a rotarod performance test of motor coordination and in the forced swim test assessing (anti-)depressant-like behaviours.

"Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), and in particular the mGluR group III receptors (subtypes 4, 6, 7, 8) are known to play a role in synaptic plasticity and learning. Here, we report the effect of mGluR7 gene ablation in different learning paradigms. In the acoustic startle response (ASR), no differences were seen between knockout (KO) mice and wildtype (WT) littermates in parameters including prepulse inhibition and habituation. In an open field test, no differences were seen between genotypes in motor activity, exploratory behaviour, and fearful behaviour. In a T-maze reinforced alternation working memory (WM) task, again no difference was seen between groups. However, when increasing the demands on working-memory in a 4-arm and 8-arm maze task, KO mice committed more WM errors than WT littermates thereby uncovering a highly significant difference between the two groups that persisted every day for the whole 9 days of the experiment. In a 4-arm maze with 2 arms baited, KO and wildtype mice committed the same number of LTM errors, whereas KOs committed more WM errors. Altogether, these findings suggest that a lack of mGluR7 mainly impairs short-term working but not long-term memory performance while having no effect on sensorimotor processing, non-associative learning, motor activity and spatial orientation. The effects on WM are task-dependent and become apparent in more complex but not simple learning tasks. We discuss how mGluR7 could influence WM.","Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), and in particular the mGluR group III receptors (subtypes 4, 6, 7, 8) are known to play a role in synaptic plasticity and learning.","Here, we report the effect of mGluR7 gene ablation in different learning paradigms.

"This study examined the relationship between voluntary running distance and glutamate- and K+-stimulated dopamine release in the striatum (nucleus accumbens and caudate-putamen) of male Long-Evans rats. Twenty-one rats were housed individually in cages with attached running-wheels for 1 week. There was a 19-fold variability between rats in voluntary running distances over this period (range = 2.3-44.6 km). The average distance completed during the week was 16 +/- 2.8 km. There was a strong positive correlation between the running distances completed during the first 24 h (day 1) and the last 24 h. Certain rats were therefore inclined to run from the start. The average daily running distance (2.4 +/- 0.4 km per day) was negatively correlated with the weight of the rat (r = -0.82). Glutamate-stimulated release of dopamine was not a significant predictor of voluntary running distance. However, the average daily running distance was negatively correlated with K+-stimulated dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core and caudate-putamen but not the nucleus accumbens shell. The present findings suggest that decreased depolarization-induced release of striatal dopamine may be a predictor of hyperactivity. The results show, in a normal population of Long-Evans rats, that there are, at the end of the continuum, rats that display some of the neurochemical and behavioral characteristics of a rat model for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.",This study examined the relationship between voluntary running distance and glutamate- and K+-stimulated dopamine release in the striatum (nucleus accumbens and caudate-putamen) of male Long-Evans rats.

"To assess the role of endogenous peptides involved in stress responsivity in the development of diet-induced obesity (DIO), selectively bred DIO and diet-resistant (DR) male were weaned onto a low fat (4.5%) chow diet at 3 weeks of age and then fed either chow or a 31% fat by energy content (high energy (HE)) diet for 9 days beginning at 4 weeks of age. Regardless of diet, DIO rats gained more weight than DR rats but did not show the selective DIO weight gain trait characteristic of older DIO rats fed HE diet. At this early age, both DR and DIO rats on HE diet ate more and had higher leptin levels but gained less body weight and had lower feed efficiency (body weight gain (g)/food intake (kcal)) than their chow-fed controls. HE diet also prevented the decline in 24h urine corticosterone levels from the third to fifth week observed in chow-fed rats. Terminally, DIO rats had lower hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and amygdalar central nucleus corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) mRNA than DR rats, regardless of their diets. Taken together with prior studies in these rats, there appears to be a critical period between 3 and 5 weeks of age when DIO and DR rats are not phenotypically different and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function is rapidly changing. The reduced expression of brain GR and CRH expression at the end of this period might contribute to the propensity of DIO rats to become obese selectively on HE diet after 5 weeks of age.","To assess the role of endogenous peptides involved in stress responsivity in the development of diet-induced obesity (DIO), selectively bred DIO and diet-resistant (DR) male were weaned onto a low fat (4.5%) chow diet at 3 weeks of age and then fed either chow or a 31% fat by energy content (high energy (HE)) diet for 9 days beginning at 4 weeks of age.","Regardless of diet, DIO rats gained more weight than DR rats but did not show the selective DIO weight gain trait characteristic of older DIO rats fed HE diet.

"This study was aimed at correlating diurnal changes in thermal preference of rats with their body temperature (Tb), sleep-wakefulness (S-W) and locomotor activity (LMA). Electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), electrooculogram (EOG) and Tb were recorded by telemetry, while an activity monitor measured LMA and thermal preference. A special environmental chamber, which was designed and fabricated, enabled for the first time, simultaneous measurement of thermal preference, along with S-W and Tb. S-W, thermal preference and LMA were recorded continuously in six adult male Wistar rats, for 24 h, for 3 days, and Tb with thermal preference and LMA were recorded for another 3 days. LMA and Tb were higher at night than during day. The rats slept less during the night time. Increased frequency of sleep episodes contributed towards increased sleep during day time. They preferred an ambient temperature (Tamb) of 24 degrees C at night and 27 degrees C during the day. Though the preference for higher Tamb during day time coincided with increased sleep, the rats did not move over to higher Tamb prior to the onset of sleep episodes. Though the diurnal alterations in sleep, Tb and LMA were similar to those reports from animals kept in constant Tamb, the day-night variation of paradoxical sleep (PS) was exaggerated when the rats selected their own preferred Tamb.","This study was aimed at correlating diurnal changes in thermal preference of rats with their body temperature (Tb), sleep-wakefulness (S-W) and locomotor activity (LMA).","Electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), electrooculogram (EOG) and Tb were recorded by telemetry, while an activity monitor measured LMA and thermal preference.

"The present study examined whether the ability to dissociate bimanual limb movements following learning of a new coordination task (i.e. star-line drawing paradigm) can be generalised to different effector systems, as expressed by inter- and intralimb transfer. In Experiment 1, subjects practised the 'Line-Star' task (i.e. left arm traced the line/right arm traced the star) and then transferred this pattern to its symmetry partner: the 'Star-Line' task (left arm star/right arm line). In Experiment 2, intralimb transfer from the shoulder-elbow (proximal) to the wrist-finger joints (distal), and vice versa, was investigated. Results revealed positive interlimb transfer among symmetry partners of the star-line movement. Moreover, learning the star-line task spontaneously transferred from the trained to the untrained effector system whereby proximal to distal transfer was larger than vice versa. It is concluded that learning to spatially dissociate the movements of both limbs is generalisable to different motor conditions even though transfer to some conditions is suboptimal. It is hypothesised that the nature of the representation of the spatial interference task is largely effector independent.","The present study examined whether the ability to dissociate bimanual limb movements following learning of a new coordination task (i.e. star-line drawing paradigm) can be generalised to different effector systems, as expressed by inter- and intralimb transfer.","In Experiment 1, subjects practised the 'Line-Star' task (i.e. left arm traced the line/right arm traced the star) and then transferred this pattern to its symmetry partner: the 'Star-Line' task (left arm star/right arm line).

"Rat experiments have shown that prenatal Vitamin D deficiency leads to altered neonatal brain morphology, cell density and neurotrophin expression. In the current study we examined the hypothesis that Vitamin D deficiency during early development alters adult behaviour even when there is an intervening period in which the animal receives normal Vitamin D in later development. Rats were conceived and born to Vitamin D deficient dams (Birth); conceived, born and weaned from Vitamin D deficient dams (Weaning); or deficient in Vitamin D from conception to 10 weeks of age (Life). Litters were standardized to three males and three females per litter. All rat offspring were rendered normocalcaemic with calcium supplemented water (2 mM) after weaning. Control animals were born to mothers fed a normal diet but subject to similar litter size and calcium supplementation. At 10 weeks all animals were tested on the holeboard test, elevated plus maze test, social interaction observation, acoustic startle response test, prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response and a forced swim test. Early Vitamin D deficiency (Birth group) enhanced locomotion in the holeboard test and increased activity in the elevated plus maze. Thus, transient prenatal Vitamin D deficiency induces hyperlocomotion in adulthood, without severe motor abnormalities.","Rat experiments have shown that prenatal Vitamin D deficiency leads to altered neonatal brain morphology, cell density and neurotrophin expression.

"Immune responses can be modulated by Pavlovian conditioning techniques. In this study, to evaluate the conditionability of antibody response via a single-trial conditioning paradigm, we used a protein antigen ovalbumin as an unconditioned stimulus (UCS) that was paired with a novel taste of saccharin in a single-trial learning protocol. A significant enhancement of anti-ovalbumin antibody production was observed in the conditioned rats at Days 15, 20 and 25 after re-exposure to the conditioned stimulus. The pattern of conditioned antibody response is similar to that of antigen-induced antibody response. Furthermore, to identify the involvement of a limbic brain structure in the expression of conditioned antibody response, immediate-early gene c-fos expression was used as a marker of neuronal activation to detect the functional activation in the insular cortex (IC) in response to the conditioned stimulus. The re-exposure of conditioned rats to the conditioned stimulus resulted in a significant increase of c-Fos immunoreactivity in all three areas of the IC including the agranular, dysgranular, and granular areas, suggesting that IC is involved in the neural mechanism of expression of conditioned immune response.",Immune responses can be modulated by Pavlovian conditioning techniques.,"In this study, to evaluate the conditionability of antibody response via a single-trial conditioning paradigm, we used a protein antigen ovalbumin as an unconditioned stimulus (UCS) that was paired with a novel taste of saccharin in a single-trial learning protocol.

"The ubiquitous transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB plays a prominent role in regulation of inflammatory immune responses and in cell survival. Recently, it has been found to be active in neurons, and mice lacking NF-kappaB subunits p50 or p65 show deficits in specific cognitive tasks. Here we demonstrate a strikingly low level of anxiety-like behavior in the p50(-/-) mouse. In an open field, the mutant mice showed significantly less defecation, more rearing, and more time spent in the center compartment relative to wild type control mice. The p50(-/-) mice also spent more time investigating a novel object placed in the open field. On the elevated plus maze, p50(-/-) mice spent more time on the open arms and had increased numbers of open arm entries relative to wild type. In group housing conditions, they did not establish dominant-subordinate hierarchies, whereas wild type control animals did so, in part, by whisker barbering and conspecific allogrooming. In tests of general health, sensorimotor function, and daily activity on a circadian rhythm, p50(-/-) mice were normal. Thus, absence of the p50 subunit of the NF-kappaB transcription factor, which results in altered NF-kappaB transcriptional activity in cells throughout the body and brain, alters neuronal circuitry underlying manifestation of emotional behavior. The p50 subunit appears to play a role in normal expression of certain forms of anxiety.","The ubiquitous transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB plays a prominent role in regulation of inflammatory immune responses and in cell survival.

"Neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) regulates the adaptation of rodents in the novel environment. In the present study we analysed the behavioural changes induced by the individual housing in mice, lacking CCK(2) receptors. The wild-type (+/+) and homozygous (-/-) CCK(2) receptor deficient mice of both gender were used throughout the study. The weight gain during the 21-day isolation period and changes in the locomotor activity following the social separation were measured. The elevated plus-maze and resident/intruder tests were also performed to test alterations in the emotional behaviour. Social isolation induced locomotor hyperactivity, reduced weight gain and increased aggressiveness in the wild-type (+/+) and homozygous (-/-) male mice. In the wild-type (+/+) female mice the significant reduction of exploratory activity in the plus-maze was evident. By contrast, in female mice, lacking CCK(2) receptors, the exploration of the plus-maze was not significantly affected by the individual housing. This finding demonstrates that the social isolation does not cause anxiety-like state in the CCK(2) receptor deficient mice. Moreover, the targeted invalidation of CCK(2) receptors increased in male mice the affinity of dopamine D(2) receptors in the sub-cortical structures, whereas in female mice the increased affinity of 5-hydroxytryptamine(2) (5-HT(2)) receptors in the frontal cortex was established. The increased affinity of 5-HT(2) receptors is probably the compensatory change to the lack of CCK(2) receptors in female mice and probably reflects the reduced sensitivity of these animals to the anxiogenic manipulations. In conclusion, targeted mutation of CCK(2) receptors selectively antagonised the behavioural changes induced by the individual housing in females, but not in male mice.","Neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) regulates the adaptation of rodents in the novel environment. In the present study we analysed the behavioural changes induced by the individual housing in mice, lacking CCK(2) receptors.",The wild-type (+/+) and homozygous (-/-) CCK(2) receptor deficient mice of both gender were used throughout the study. The weight gain during the 21-day isolation period and changes in the locomotor activity following the social separation were measured. The elevated plus-maze and resident/intruder tests were also performed to test alterations in the emotional behaviour.,"Social isolation induced locomotor hyperactivity, reduced weight gain and increased aggressiveness in the wild-type (+/+) and homozygous (-/-) male mice. In the wild-type (+/+) female mice the significant reduction of exploratory activity in the plus-maze was evident. By contrast, in female mice, lacking CCK(2) receptors, the exploration of the plus-maze was not significantly affected by the individual housing. This finding demonstrates that the social isolation does not cause anxiety-like state in the CCK(2) receptor deficient mice. Moreover, the targeted invalidation of CCK(2) receptors increased in male mice the affinity of dopamine D(2) receptors in the sub-cortical structures, whereas in female mice the increased affinity of 5-hydroxytryptamine(2) (5-HT(2)) receptors in the frontal cortex was established.

"In order to test the hypothesis that the ontogenetic development of the corpus callosum is related to the establishment of behavioral laterality, the rotatory behavior in the free swimming test was studied in male mice of the BALB/cCF strain, in which approximately 20% of the animals present total or partial callosal agenesis. All animals were submitted to three sessions of the free-swimming rotatory test in three different sessions (diameter of the recipient = 21 cm; session duration = 5 min; inter-test interval = 48 h). The number and direction of the 30 and 360 degrees turns were recorded. Animals were classified as side-consistent turners (to the right or to the left) when they did not change their preferred side of rotation in all three sessions and in both turning units. In general our results suggested that acallosal animals present more pronounced laterality than normal ones. In the acallosal group, the percentage of consistent turners was significantly higher than that of non-consistent turners. The percentage of animals that presented strong turning preferences in the acallosal group was higher than in the normal group. In first session, the acallosal group presented a higher average number of turns to preferred side than the normal group. Taken together, our results constitute an endorsement to the hypothesis that the normal development of the corpus callosum is related to the establishment of cerebral laterality.","In order to test the hypothesis that the ontogenetic development of the corpus callosum is related to the establishment of behavioral laterality, the rotatory behavior in the free swimming test was studied in male mice of the BALB/cCF strain, in which approximately 20% of the animals present total or partial callosal agenesis.",All animals were submitted to three sessions of the free-swimming rotatory test in three different sessions (diameter of the recipient = 21 cm; session duration = 5 min; inter-test interval = 48 h).

"This study was designed to investigate the effect of single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the isochronic performance of sequential movements which were recorded using a digitising pad. Magnetic stimulation was applied through an 8-shaped magnetic coil over primary motor and premotor cortex at a specific time point while executing the first of a three movement sequence. TMS applied to the premotor cortex showed an alteration effect on the first movement while stimulation of the primary motor cortex influenced the second movement in the sequence. Results suggest that the premotor cortex is involved in online monitoring and controlling of spatio-temporal features of trajectories while the motor cortex contributes to the execution of movements. Isochrony is maintained to a high degree under TMS which has been found in other studies to delay reaction times. The results show that although TMS has a significant influence on motor performance, isochrony is a robust component of motor programs, not readily to be disturbed.",This study was designed to investigate the effect of single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the isochronic performance of sequential movements which were recorded using a digitising pad.,Magnetic stimulation was applied through an 8-shaped magnetic coil over primary motor and premotor cortex at a specific time point while executing the first of a three movement sequence.,"TMS applied to the premotor cortex showed an alteration effect on the first movement while stimulation of the primary motor cortex influenced the second movement in the sequence.

Prior studies have shown that circuits within the spinal cord can support a simple form of instrumental learning. Spinally transected rats are given shock to one hind leg whenever the leg is extended. This response-outcome contingency causes an increase in flexion duration. The present experiments examine whether the NMDA receptor is involved in the acquisition and maintenance of this instrumental response. Experiment 1 showed that the NMDA receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate acid (AP5) reduces instrumental responding in a dose-dependent fashion. Experiment 2 showed that AP5 given after training eliminates the increase in flexion duration. The results implicate the NMDA receptor in the acquisition and maintenance of spinally mediated instrumental behavior.,Prior studies have shown that circuits within the spinal cord can support a simple form of instrumental learning.

"Mobile communication is based on utilization of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) in the frequency range of 0.3-300 GHz. Human and animal studies suggest that EMFs, which are in the 0.1 MHz-300 GHz range, might interfere with cognitive processes. In 1994, a report by Lai et al. [Bioelectromagnetics 15 (1994) 95-104] showed that whole-body exposure of rats to pulsed 2.45 GHz microwaves (2 micros pulse width, 500 pps, and specific absorption rate [SAR] 0.6 W/kg) for 45 min resulted in altered spatial working memory assessed in a 12-arm radial-maze task. Surprisingly, there has been only one attempt to replicate this experiment so far [Bioelectromagnetics 25 (2004) 49-57]; confirmation of the Lai et al. experiment failed. In the present study, rats were tested in a 12-arm radial-maze subsequently to a daily exposure to 2.45 GHz microwaves (2 micros pulse width, 500 pps, and SAR 0.6 W/kg) for 45 min. The performance of exposed rats was comparable to that found in sham-exposed or in naive rats (no contact with the exposure system). Regarding the methodological details provided by Lai et al. on their testing protocol, our results might suggest that the microwave-induced behavioral alterations measured by these authors might have had more to do with factors liable to performance bias than with spatial working memory per se.","Mobile communication is based on utilization of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) in the frequency range of 0.3-300 GHz.

"Post-synaptic GABA(B) responses (slow, late hyperpolarisations which can be eliminated by perfusion with phaclofen) can be recorded in vitro from many, but not all, neurones in the intermediate medial hyperstriatum ventrale (IMHV). The IMHV is an area of the chick forebrain which is remarkable for its plasticity, and for its essential role in two specific types of early learning-imprinting, and a form of one-trial passive-avoidance learning. Post-synaptic GABA(B) responses are strongly statistically associated with other properties (such as high membrane resistance) which are, themselves, dependent on a bird's past history. There is also evidence that their incidence changes with prior training in vivo and with age. GABA(B) hyperpolarisations are always offset to a varying extent by excitatory NMDA components. These two components follow a very similar time-course, so that the duration and (to a lesser extent), the magnitude of a response is controlled by the balance between the two systems. The evidence suggests that this balance fluctuates, and that its fluctuations determine the extent to which any neurone can function as a coincidence detector.","Post-synaptic GABA(B) responses (slow, late hyperpolarisations which can be eliminated by perfusion with phaclofen) can be recorded in vitro from many, but not all, neurones in the intermediate medial hyperstriatum ventrale (IMHV).

"The purpose of this study was to determine the importance of the pathways running in the ventrolateral spinal funiculus for overground locomotion in adult, freely behaving rats. Left-sided ventrolateral cervical spinal cord injury was performed in adult female Long-Evans rats. The behavioural abilities of these animals were analyzed at 2 days, and weekly for up to 5.5 weeks following spinal cord injury. Behavioural testing consisted of Von Frey filament testing, ladder walking, a paw usage task, and the assessment of ground reaction forces during unrestrained trotting. Animals with injury to the left ventrolateral cervical spinal cord did not develop enhanced sensitivity to pedal mechanical stimulation. At 2 days following injury, animals had impaired skilled locomotion as indicated by increased number of footslips during ladder walking. At 2 days, these animals also used both limbs together more often for support while rearing, while using the forelimb ipsilateral to the injury less than did uninjured animals. Ground reaction force determination revealed that animals tend to bear less weight on the forelimb and hindlimb ipsilateral to the spinal cord injury 2 days after injury. All animals recovered normal or near normal sensorimotor abilities although subtle asymmetries in ground reaction forces were detectable at 5.5 weeks following spinal cord injury. These results suggest that axons in the ventrolateral spinal funiculi contribute to limb movements during exploration and locomotion but their roles can be served by other pathways after ventrolateral spinal injury.","The purpose of this study was to determine the importance of the pathways running in the ventrolateral spinal funiculus for overground locomotion in adult, freely behaving rats.","Left-sided ventrolateral cervical spinal cord injury was performed in adult female Long-Evans rats.

"Both hypothyroidism and stress interfere with cognitive function in patients. This study examined the effect of hypothyroidism and stress on hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in rats using the novel radial arm water maze (RAWM), which measures spatial working memory. Hypothyroidism was accomplished by thyroidectomy and 2 weeks later a form of intruder stress was used as the chronic psychosocial stressor. After 4-6 weeks of stress, rats were trained to learn (during the acquisition phase; four trials) and then remember (during two memory test trials occurring 15 and 120 min after the acquisition phase) the within-day location of a hidden escape platform, which was in different arm every day. The number of errors (entry into arms other than the platform arm) was noted. Within-day learning of the platform location was largely unaffected by the experimental manipulations, indicating that rats in all groups were equally capable of finding the platform to escape from the water with similar numbers of errors (P &gt; 0.005). The number of days a rat took to reach a criterion (DTC; a maximum of one error in three consecutive days) indicated that chronic stress or hypothyroidism, alone, resulted in a mild impairment of spatial memory, and the combination of chronic stress and hypothyroidism resulted in a more severe and long-lasting memory impairment. The data indicated that the combination of stress and hypothyroidism produced more deleterious effects on hippocampal function than either chronic stress or hypothyroidism alone.",Both hypothyroidism and stress interfere with cognitive function in patients.,"This study examined the effect of hypothyroidism and stress on hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in rats using the novel radial arm water maze (RAWM), which measures spatial working memory.

"A place learning paradigm was used to assess lateralisation and sex differences in domestic chicks dealing with global (geometric shape) and local (identity of a beacon) aspects of spatial encoding. Male and female domestic chicks were trained binocularly to localise food buried under sawdust in the centre of a square-shaped enclosure. They were then tested binocularly and monocularly (Experiment 1). Training in the same task was also carried out in the presence of a centrally placed visual beacon, so that chicks could then be tested in a number of transformed versions of the training arrangement: after removing the beacon (Experiment 2), after shifting the beacon to a corner (Experiment 3) and after simultaneously shifting the beacon to a corner and replacing it with a second, visually different, beacon (Experiment 4). Results show that the right hemisphere prevalently attends to the geometry of the environment in both male and female chicks. Males rely upon local information (beacon) more than females, also showing stronger encoding of this information in their left hemisphere than their right hemisphere.",A place learning paradigm was used to assess lateralisation and sex differences in domestic chicks dealing with global (geometric shape) and local (identity of a beacon) aspects of spatial encoding.,"Male and female domestic chicks were trained binocularly to localise food buried under sawdust in the centre of a square-shaped enclosure.

"The present study: (1) tested the importance of the retrosplenial cortex for learning a specific heading direction and distance and, (2) determined if lesion size could explain apparent inconsistencies in the results of different research groups. Dark agouti rats received either 'complete' cytotoxic retrosplenial cortex lesions or 'standard' lesions, the latter sparing the caudal retrosplenial cortex. Animals were first tested on two versions of a ""landmark"" task in a water maze. In condition 1 animals could use both heading direction and allocentric position, while in condition 2 only heading direction was effective. In condition 1, animals with complete retrosplenial lesions were impaired by the end of training, their profile of performance being consistent with a failure to use allocentric position information. When the water maze task changed (condition 2) so that allocentric cues became redundant, the animals with complete retrosplenial lesions were able to head in the appropriate direction although they showed longer swim paths. Subsequent testing in the radial-arm maze provided more evidence that retrosplenial lesions can disrupt the use of distal (allocentric) room cues. The impairments seen with retrosplenial lesions were often mild but throughout the study performance of rats with 'complete' lesions was more disrupted than those with 'standard' lesions, who often did not differ from the controls. These findings show that lesion size is a critical factor and may explain why some studies have failed to find comparable deficits after retrosplenial cortex lesions.","The present study: (1) tested the importance of the retrosplenial cortex for learning a specific heading direction and distance and, (2) determined if lesion size could explain apparent inconsistencies in the results of different research groups.","Dark agouti rats received either 'complete' cytotoxic retrosplenial cortex lesions or 'standard' lesions, the latter sparing the caudal retrosplenial cortex.

"Through the proinflammatory cytokines secreted in response to inflammation or injury, the immune system produces physiological and behavioral alterations. This study analyzes the effects on behavior, mononuclear proliferative response and central monoamine activity in response to the inoculation of tumor cells in mice submitted to social stress. Two groups of male OF1 mice were used, one of which was inoculated with B16 melanoma cells. Both groups were subdivided into two new groups, with one being submitted to social stress through sensory contact model with a selected aggressive subject, and the other being handled without social interaction. Subjects were exposed to social stress for a 24-h period, with three 5 min intervals of direct physical interaction, where the behavior was recorded and assessed. One hour after the stress and/or handling, they were put down and samples taken for physiological assessment. Significant behavioral changes were found in subjects with implanted tumors, mainly characterized by an increase in avoidance behavior and a decrease in immobility, defense-submission and non-social exploration behavior, coupled with an increase in the spleen mononuclear cell proliferative response. Similarly, an increase was observed in the density of dopamine(2) (D(2))-receptors in the striatum (SRT) and an increase in dopaminergic (DOPAC/DA) and serotonergic (5HIAA/5HT) turnover in the hypothalamus. The increase in the density of D(2)-receptors in the SRT coincides with the decrease in some behaviors with a predominant motor component. The results indicate significant changes in the defensive strategy used to cope with situations of intense social stress in mice bearing tumors.","Through the proinflammatory cytokines secreted in response to inflammation or injury, the immune system produces physiological and behavioral alterations.","This study analyzes the effects on behavior, mononuclear proliferative response and central monoamine activity in response to the inoculation of tumor cells in mice submitted to social stress.

"We tested the role of the hippocampus in spatial memory of zebra finches. The birds were trained to find the location of a food site among four identical feeders arranged on the aviary floor. Extra-maze cues were present. The birds had to perform the task from four different starting points. Successful visits and the time to find the food were recorded. Hippocampal lesions made before acquisition led to a decrease in correct choices. Hippocampal lesions following training disrupted the retention of the spatial memory. Surprisingly, birds with hippocampal damage reached the food as quickly as intact birds, but they needed more visits to find the correct feeder.

"Effects of unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) on anhedonic-like behaviour, physical state, body weight, learning and memory were investigated in three strains of mice. These strains were chosen among 11 strains that were tested in a first experiment for their sucrose consumption and preference for sucrose solutions of different concentrations. In the second experiment, groups of mice of the CBA/H, C57BL/6 and DBA/2 strains were submitted to 7 weeks of UCMS. Measures of the sucrose consumption, the evaluation of the physical state and the measurement of body weight were weekly assessed. Following 4-week period of UCMS, sub-groups of stressed and non-stressed mice were submitted to the spontaneous alternation test in the Y-maze, and then to the water-maze test for spatial learning and memory. UCMS induced a significant decrease of the sucrose consumption in CBA/H and in C57BL/6 but not in DBA/2 mice. The UCMS effect on sucrose intake in CBA/H mice was associated with a body weight loss and a physical state degradation.

"The involvement of the septohippocampal system on the impaired sensorimotor gating induced by phencyclidine (PCP) or by an electrically induced hippocampal seizure was examined in behaving rats. An impaired sensorimotor gating, measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response, was observed following a hippocampal afterdischarge (AD) or systemic injection of PCP and was accompanied with an increase in hippocampal gamma waves (30-70 Hz). The medial septum infusion with muscimol (0.25 microg), a GABA(A) receptor agonist, 15 min prior to PCP or a hippocampal AD, prevented the impairment of sensorimotor gating and the increase in gamma waves. By itself, muscimol (0.25 microg) injection into the medial septum did not affect PPI, although it significantly suppressed spontaneous gamma waves. In order to identify subpopulations of neurons mediating the sensorimotor gating deficit and the hippocampal gamma wave increase, 0.14-0.21 microg of p75 antibody conjugated to saporin (192 IgG-saporin) was injected into the medial septum to selectively lesion the septohippocampal cholinergic neurons. Neither the PPI deficit nor the gamma wave increase induced by PCP or a hippocampal AD was affected by 192 IgG-saporin lesion of the medial septum. It is concluded that increase in neural activity in the medial septum participates in the impairment of sensorimotor gating and the increase in hippocampal gamma waves induced by PCP or a hippocampal AD.

"In the face of contradictory findings on the role of visual cortex contributions to spatial behavior, the present study evaluated the ability of rats with primary visual cortex (area 17) lesions to learn spatial problems in a swimming pool. Because the solution to any spatial learning problem consists of acquiring at least two primary elements of a task, task procedures and spatial learning, the study, in addition to assessing spatial ability on a place task, used two training/testing methods to identify the nature of the spatial impairment associated with visual cortex lesions. Non-spatial training consisted of learning to find a platform in the dark and spatial training consisted of a series of matching-to-place problems. The results confirmed that although rats with visual cortex lesions were impaired on place learning, the deficit was partially ameliorated by non-spatial training given following the lesion, and completely ameliorated by non-spatial training given before the lesion. Nevertheless, all visual cortex groups failed to show a quadrant preference on a probe trial and displayed a profound impairment in matching-to-place learning. This definitive demonstration that appropriate testing methods can reveal a failure in spatial behavior following visual cortex lesions is consistent with the idea that primary visual cortex is required in spatial navigation.","In the face of contradictory findings on the role of visual cortex contributions to spatial behavior, the present study evaluated the ability of rats with primary visual cortex (area 17) lesions to learn spatial problems in a swimming pool.

"We have demonstrated that oxidative stress is involved, at least in part, in beta-amyloid protein (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity in vivo [Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999;11:83-90; Neuroscience 2003;119:399-419]. However, mechanistic links between oxidative stress and memory loss in response to Abeta remain elusive. In the present study, we examined whether oxidative stress contributes to the memory deficits induced by intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta (1-42) in mice. Abeta (1-42)-induced memory impairments were observed, as measured by the water maze and passive avoidance tests, although these impairments were not found in Abeta (40-1)-treated mice. Treatment with antioxidant alpha-tocopherol significantly prevented memory impairment induced by Abeta (1-42). Increased activities of the cytosolic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) and mitochondrial Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) were observed in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of Abeta (1-42)-treated animals, as compared with Abeta (40-1)-treated mice. The induction of Cu,Zn-SOD was more pronounced than that of Mn-SOD after Abeta (1-42) insult. However, the concomitant induction of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) in response to significant increases in SOD activity was not seen in animals treated with Abeta (1-42). Furthermore, glutathione reductase (GRX) activity was only increased at 2h after Abeta (1-42) injection. Production of malondialdehyde (lipid peroxidation) and protein carbonyl (protein oxidation) remained elevated at 10 days post-Abeta (1-42), but the antioxidant alpha-tocopherol significantly prevented these oxidative stresses. Therefore, our results suggest that the oxidative stress contributes to the Abeta (1-42)-induced learning and memory deficits in mice.","We have demonstrated that oxidative stress is involved, at least in part, in beta-amyloid protein (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity in vivo [Eur.

"Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex is an operational measure of sensorimotor gating. The dopamine receptor agonist-mediated disruption of PPI in rats is widely used as a model of the sensorimotor gating deficiencies demonstrated in schizophrenia patients. As a possible tool for validation of a pig model of psychosis, we wished to verify the existence of PPI in landrace pigs and investigate the potential disruption of PPI by d-amphetamine (AMPH) in these animals. PPI of the acoustic startle reflex and its potential disruption by AMPH were investigated using three doses 0.5-1.5mg/kg with a paradigm including two levels of prepulses (82 and 88dB) and a prepulse (PP) interval of 60 and 120ms. We found an average PPI of the startle reflex of 25.6% and both of the investigated PP intensities and PP intervals were equally effective in this PP-inhibitive paradigm. AMPH significantly disrupted PPI and, in spite of only the 0.5mg/kg dose proved statistically significant, the results indicate this to be dose-related. We have demonstrated the phenomenon of PPI of the startle reflex in landrace pigs and its disruption by d-amphetamine. Studies of sensorimotor gating defects could be a valuable additional tool in assessing pig models of neuropsychiatric disorders.","Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex is an operational measure of sensorimotor gating.

"We embarked on a study to delineate the behavioural changes in mice after 4 weeks of voluntary exercise. As an initial behavioural characterization, we exposed the control and exercising mice to a modified hole board and an open field test. As compared to control mice, exercising animals showed clear signs of increased behavioural inhibition (e.g. a longer latency to enter unprotected areas), suggesting increased anxiety in these animals. In addition, the exercising mice were reluctant to spend time in the open field's centre during the beginning of the 30-min open field test, but compensated for this at later times. Paradoxically, the exercising animals showed more rearings on the board of the modified hole board, indicating decreased anxiety. Thus, the behavioural inhibition seen in exercising mice is likely to represent decreased stress responsiveness at the behavioural level which can also be interpreted as reduced impulsiveness. To clarify whether voluntary exercise evolves in more or less anxiety-related behaviour, we exposed animals to the elevated plus-maze and the dark-light box, two selective tests for unconditioned anxiety. Clearly, compared to the control animals, exercising mice spent significantly more time on the open arm of the plus-maze and spent double the amount of time in the light compartment of the dark-light box. Taken together, we conclude that long-term voluntary exercise appears to result in decreased anxiety-related behaviour and impulsiveness. Thus, our observations fit into the concept that regular exercise strengthens endogenous stress coping mechanisms, thereby protecting the organism against the deleterious effects of stress.",We embarked on a study to delineate the behavioural changes in mice after 4 weeks of voluntary exercise.,"As an initial behavioural characterization, we exposed the control and exercising mice to a modified hole board and an open field test.

"When attacking a spiny mouse in an experimental arena, a barn owl launched a few attacks from distant perches, made repetitive short-distance swoops in each attack and remained in the vicinity of the prey while chasing it. The spiny mouse fled in response, and typically oriented to face the owl whenever it stopped. When attacking a vole, the barn owl performed a greater number of attacks from distant perches, and left the vicinity of the prey after a few short-distance chases or capture attempts. Voles responded to these attacks in unspecific combinations of freezing and fleeing, and did not turn to face the owl when they stopped. Four conclusions are drawn from these encounters. First, two strategies characterized these predator-prey interactions; in one, both predator and prey continuously maintained awareness of each other's location; whereas in the other they continuously attempted to avoid the attention of the other. Second, responses of spiny mice and voles were a manifestation of protean behavior, with spiny mice fleeing in an alternating pattern and voles alternating between running and freezing. Third, locomotor response to owl attack comprised behavior that is an augmentation of normal behavior, with voles clinging to the walls and spiny mice running with frequent and irregular changes in direction. Fourth, the different defensive responses accord with the motor capacities and habitat of each rodent species. All in all, these results demonstrate the dynamic and multidimensional nature of predator-prey interactions.","When attacking a spiny mouse in an experimental arena, a barn owl launched a few attacks from distant perches, made repetitive short-distance swoops in each attack and remained in the vicinity of the prey while chasing it.

"This study investigated the capacity of erythropoietin (EPO) to protect fear conditioning performances against functional inactivation of the amygdala. We infused an excitotoxic dose of glutamate in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) of adult rats in order to block the output projections to brainstem areas controlling the expression of conditioned fear responses. Subsequently, animals with excitotoxic lesions in the LA displayed altered short and long-term fear conditioned responses, but the integrity of their general emotional reactivity was preserved, as indicated by their open-field behavior. EPO infused immediately after glutamate succeeded to protect the conditioned fear performances of rats.

"The use of transgenic models in scientific research has made an enormous contribution to our understanding of the causes and symptoms of many diseases, including neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). In the creation of transgenic models of neurodegenerative disease, effects of the background strain of the animal on the resulting genotype must be taken into consideration. This is particularly true for behavioural studies in which the background strain of the mouse may mask the phenotype of the genetic manipulation. Here, the behaviour of two mouse strains used in transgenic models, FVB/N and C57BL6/J, were compared. Studies of circadian wheel activity, cognition and aggression revealed considerable phenotypic differences between strains.

"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different stress models on copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD), catalase (CAT) and selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (Se-GSH-Px) activities, and reduced glutathione (GSH), protein carbonyl (PC) and lipid peroxidation marker (conjugated diene (CD) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS)) levels in brain of rats, and to determine the most effective stress model according to each parameter. Rats were divided into four groups as following: control group (C), immobilization stress group (IS), cold stress group (CS) and immobilization-cold stress group (ICS). All stress models increased brain Cu,Zn-SOD and CAT activities, PC, CD and TBARS levels, plasma corticosterone levels and decreased brain GSH concentrations. Se-GSH-Px activity was increased in CS and ICS groups. When all stress models were taken into consideration, the highest increases in Cu,Zn-SOD and Se-GSH-Px activities were found in CS group.

"Chronic low grade stress predispose to psychopathological disorders. We consistently showed that chronic ultra-mild stress (CUMS) applied to B6D2F1 female mice induced behavioral disinhibition in several conflict exploration models. Insufficient reactivity to conflicts may be maladaptive and lead to inappropriate appreciation of potential risks and impaired ability to cope with those. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to assess the effect of a CUMS procedure on the behavior of mice in a motor risk situation based on multisensory conflict. Following three weeks exposure to various mild stressors, stressed and control B6D2F1 mice were tested on the rotating beam to determine how CUMS exposure affected balance control, posture stability and locomotor performance in response to a sensory-motor challenge. Detailed behavioral analysis included several parameters, both postural (height of the trunk, tail angle, number of imbalances, falls and head movements) and kinetic (mean velocity on the beam, distance covered with large and small movements, plus time spent in no-motion episodes). Comparisons between control and stressed mice showed that CUMS exposure increased mean velocity and improved locomotor performance in the learning task. In addition, sensitivity to sensory conflict seemed to be reduced in stressed mice, which displayed fewer behavioral adjustments to the increasing difficulty of the test compared to control mice. The results are discussed in terms of the possible influence of disturbances in behavioral and attentional inhibitory processes following CUMS exposure. Whether longer periods of CUMS exposure would shift the performance on the RTB from improvement to deterioration remain to be established.","Chronic low grade stress predispose to psychopathological disorders.

Therefore, the purpose of the study was to assess the effect of a CUMS procedure on the behavior of mice in a motor risk situation based on multisensory conflict.","Following three weeks exposure to various mild stressors, stressed and control B6D2F1 mice were tested on the rotating beam to determine how CUMS exposure affected balance control, posture stability and locomotor performance in response to a sensory-motor challenge. Detailed behavioral analysis included several parameters, both postural (height of the trunk, tail angle, number of imbalances, falls and head movements) and kinetic (mean velocity on the beam, distance covered with large and small movements, plus time spent in no-motion episodes).","Comparisons between control and stressed mice showed that CUMS exposure increased mean velocity and improved locomotor performance in the learning task. In addition, sensitivity to sensory conflict seemed to be reduced in stressed mice, which displayed fewer behavioral adjustments to the increasing difficulty of the test compared to control mice. The results are discussed in terms of the possible influence of disturbances in behavioral and attentional inhibitory processes following CUMS exposure. Whether longer periods of CUMS exposure would shift the performance on the RTB from improvement to deterioration remain to be established.",1,1,1,"Comparisons between control and stressed mice showed that CUMS exposure increased mean velocity and improved locomotor performance in the learning task.

"In rats, early life stimulation can enhance learning and memory and induce parallel changes in brain asymmetry. Despite persistent interest in human brain asymmetry, relatively little is known in animal models about developmental stability of early-experience effects on asymmetry and how early-experience may affect males and females differently in asymmetry measures across developmental stages. We exposed male and female neonatal rats to a novel cage for 3min per day during the first 3 weeks of life and measured spontaneous turning behavior at juvenility (7 weeks of age) and adulthood (7 months of age). We found that (1) the effects of such neonatal novelty exposure on turning bias are developmentally stable, and (2) neonatal novelty exposure differentially modulates turning bias in males and females. We briefly discuss implications of these findings in terms of the role of brain asymmetry in modulating cognitive and emotional development.","In rats, early life stimulation can enhance learning and memory and induce parallel changes in brain asymmetry.

"There is an important debate regarding the functional role of the 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(7) receptor in memory systems. Hence, the objective of this paper is to investigate the function of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in memory consolidation, utilising an autoshaping Pavlovian/instrumental learning test. Specific antagonists at 5-HT(1A) (WAY 100635) and 5-HT(7) (SB-269970 or DR 4004) receptors administered i.p. or s.c.) after training, significantly decreased the improvement of performance produced by the 5-HT(1A/7) agonist 8-OH-DPAT to levels lower than controls'. These same antagonists attenuated the decreased level of performance produced by mCPP, although they decrease the performance levels after p-chloroamphetamine (PCA) lesion of the 5-HT system, which has no effect on its own on the conditioned response. Moreover, SB-269970 or DR 4004 reversed amnesia induced by scopolamine and dizocilpine. These data confirm a role for 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(7) receptors in memory formation and support the hypothesis that serotonergic, cholinergic, and glutamatergic systems interact in cognitively impaired animals. These findings support a potential role for both 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(7) receptors in the pathophysiology and/or treatment of schizophrenia, cognitive deficits and the mechanism of action of atypical antipsychotic drugs.","There is an important debate regarding the functional role of the 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(7) receptor in memory systems.

"In the present study, using the mental chronometry paradigm, we examined the hypothesis that during motor imagery the brain uses a forward internal model of arm inertial properties to predict the motion of the arm in different dynamic states. Seven subjects performed overt and covert arm movements with one (motion around the shoulder joint) and two (motion around both the shoulder and elbow joints) degrees of freedom in the horizontal plane. Arm movements were executed under two loading conditions: without and with an added mass (4kg) attached to the subject's right wrist. Additionally, movements were performed in two different directions, condition which implies changes in the arm inertia due to the inertial anisotropy of the arm. Our analysis was focused on the timing features of overt and covert movements measured by means of an electronic stopwatch. Durations of right-direction arm movements (low inertial resistance) were smaller compared to durations of left-direction arm movements (high inertial resistance). Additionally, loading the arm with an added mass of 4kg significantly changed the dynamics of motion: movements were indeed more prolonged under loaded conditions. In both cases, the duration of simulated movements mirrored that of overtly executed movements. Therefore, neither the inertial anisotropy of the arm nor the addition of an external mass affected the timing correspondence between overt and covert movement execution. These findings suggest that the brain internally represents the inertial properties of the arm and makes use of it both for sensorimotor control and for the generation of motor images.","In the present study, using the mental chronometry paradigm, we examined the hypothesis that during motor imagery the brain uses a forward internal model of arm inertial properties to predict the motion of the arm in different dynamic states.","Seven subjects performed overt and covert arm movements with one (motion around the shoulder joint) and two (motion around both the shoulder and elbow joints) degrees of freedom in the horizontal plane.

"Endogenous opioid peptides that activate the delta-opioid receptor (DOR) are thought to facilitate female receptive behavior. This facilitation of lordosis has been demonstrated by intracerebroventricular infusions and injection of DOR-active ligands into the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, an area with robust DOR binding. However, DOR binding is distributed throughout the hypothalamus, and the role of DOR in other areas of the hypothalamus has not been examined. In the current study, we demonstrated DOR immunoreactivity in the medial preoptic area (MPO), in particular medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) of the preoptic area. DOR immunoreactive processes were sparsely distributed in the medial and lateral parts of the MPN. Larger DOR immunoreactive fibers were localized in the ventrolateral aspect of the lateral MPN. The MPN is involved in the modulation of female sexual receptivity and the distribution of DOR in this area suggested to us that DOR may regulate lordosis. Ovariectomized rats with unilateral cannulae aimed at the MPN were given 5microg 17beta-estradiol benzoate (EB), once every 4 days and tested for lordosis. [D-Pen(2), D-Pen(5)]-enkephalin (DPDPE), a DOR agonist, microinfused into the MPO, 52-54h after EB-priming, inhibited lordosis when compared with the aCSF (vehicle) control (P &lt;== 0.05). The inhibitory effects of DPDPE were reversed by microinjection of naltrindole, a DOR antagonist (P &lt;== 0.05). Interestingly, the DOR inhibition of lordosis is similar to the micro-opioid receptor inhibition of lordosis in the MPN. These results indicate that DOR in the MPO, particularly in the MPNm, plays an important role in the regulation of lordosis.","Endogenous opioid peptides that activate the delta-opioid receptor (DOR) are thought to facilitate female receptive behavior.

"Hamsters repeatedly exposed to cocaine during adolescence display high levels of offensive aggression compared to saline-treated littermates. The escalated offensive phenotype observed in adolescent cocaine-treated animals is modulated by serotonin (5-HT) signaling and can be suppressed by inhibiting 5-HT type 3 receptors, suggesting that these receptors might play an important role in the aggression-stimulating effects of adolescent cocaine exposure. The current study examined this hypothesis and extended earlier studies investigating the relationship between 5HT(3) receptor neural signaling and the offensive response patterns of aggressive, adolescent cocaine-treated animals compared to non-aggressive, saline-treated littermates. Adolescent cocaine-treated hamsters and saline-treated littermates were tested for offensive aggression after the administration of either the 5-HT(3) antagonist 3-tropanylindole-3-carboxylate methiodide (tropisetron) or the 5-HT(3) agonist 1-(m-chlorophenyl)-biguanide hydrochloride (mCPBG). Tropisetron significantly reduced the high levels of offensive responding observed in adolescent cocaine-treated animals, whereas treatment with the 5-HT(3) receptor agonist mCPBG failed to affect the escalated offensive response. Conversely, tropisetron failed to affect very low, baseline levels of aggressive responding seen in adolescent saline-treated animals, while 5-HT(3) receptor activation via mCPBG triggered highly escalated levels of offensive aggression in these animals. Together, these data support a stimulatory role for 5-HT(3) neural signaling in offensive aggression.","Hamsters repeatedly exposed to cocaine during adolescence display high levels of offensive aggression compared to saline-treated littermates.

"Context-dependent behavioural sensitization to nicotine develops faster and is more robust than context-independent sensitization. However, some findings suggest that behavioural sensitization develops irrespective of context. In this study an attempt was made to dissociate the development of context-dependent nicotine sensitization from the onset of nicotine-conditioned locomotor stimulation. Seven days of daily nicotine administration (0.6 mg/kg, s.c.) paired with exposure to locomotor activity boxes produced stable and consistent behavioural sensitization, at which time no nicotine-induced conditioned locomotor stimulation could be demonstrated. However, after an additional two days of nicotine treatment, i.e. on day 9, nicotine-conditioned behavioural stimulation was observed. Our findings suggest that behavioural sensitization to nicotine appears to reach a plateau before induction of nicotine-conditioned locomotor stimulation.","Context-dependent behavioural sensitization to nicotine develops faster and is more robust than context-independent sensitization.

"Psychophysical studies suggest that reward-relevant neurons in the posterior mesencephalon (PM) form a caudal extension of the axonal pathway that mediates the rewarding effectiveness of electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle. The present study sought to further characterize the reward-relevant functional link between these two regions by assessing changes to the rewarding effectiveness of caudal medial forebrain bundle stimulation (ventral tegmental area, VTA) subsequent to electrolytic lesions of different PM sites. A total of 13 rats were tested, 11 of these at bilateral VTA stimulation sites. Overall, rewarding effectiveness was reduced in five rats and pontentiated in four. The presence and magnitude of the effects were site-, current- and time-dependent, and ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 log(10) unit shifts in reward magnitude, with most effects falling below 0.3 log(10) units. Generally, these effects became apparent approximately two weeks after the lesion. In addition to these effects, PM lesions placed on or close to the midline also produced small transient reductions in rewarding effectiveness immediately after the lesion, an effect that disappeared within three days. Conversely, lateral PM lesions were associated either with no immediate effects or with small transient potentiations of reward. The finding that lesions of the PM placed on the midline, just off the midline or laterally all altered the rewarding effectiveness of VTA stimulation suggests that the reward-relevant circuitry is distributed diffusely throughout the PM.","Psychophysical studies suggest that reward-relevant neurons in the posterior mesencephalon (PM) form a caudal extension of the axonal pathway that mediates the rewarding effectiveness of electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle.

"Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of toxins, such as the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is associated with a well-characterized increase in sensitivity to painful stimuli (hyperalgesia) [Watkins LR, Maier SF, Goehler LE. Immune activation: the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in inflammation, illness responses and pathological pain states. Pain 1995;63:289-302.

Acute and conditioned sickness reduces morphine analgesia. Behav Brain Res 2003;142:89-97]. Here we show that this inhibition of morphine analgesia 24 h after a single i.p. injection of LPS involves mechanisms that contribute to illness-induced hyperalgesia and the development of analgesic tolerance to morphine. Specifically, morphine analgesia was restored if LPS was preceded by systemic administration of a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist (MK-801), spinal infusion of a glial metabolic inhibitor (fluorocitrate), or intracerebroventricular microinjection of an opioid receptor antagonist (naloxone). Morphine analgesia was also restored if MK-801 was administered after LPS. These results demonstrate that LPS recruits similar, if not the same mechanisms that reduce morphine tolerance following opiate administration: namely, stimulation of opioid and NMDA receptors and recruitment of spinal glia.","Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of toxins, such as the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is associated with a well-characterized increase in sensitivity to painful stimuli (hyperalgesia) [Watkins LR, Maier SF, Goehler LE.

"The dopamine (DA) precursor, L-DOPA (500 microg), was injected into living crickets, which were ingested (one each) by adult male Anolis carolinensis. This method of delivery elevated plasma L-DOPA and DA concentrations by approximately 1000-fold. In contrast, plasma epinephrine (Epi) and norepinephrine (NE) were not influenced by L-DOPA treatment, although they were elevated following the consumption of the cricket. Lizards that ingested L-DOPA treated crickets had elevated L-DOPA in all brain regions measured, with DA and/or DOPAC also increased significantly in most brain regions studied. Despite increased DA levels in the striatum and nucleus accumbens as a response to L-DOPA, the treatment had no influence on general motor activity. Central serotonin, NE, and Epi systems were not affected in any brain region by oral L-DOPA treatment. In addition, aggression was inhibited by this dose of L-DOPA, even though there was no effect on serotonergic systems. This is surprising because controlling aggressive behavior is usually considered the province of serotonergic activity. Aggression was measured before and after treatment, and while saline-treated lizards retained the full vigor of aggressive activity, those fed a cricket injected with L-DOPA were only one-third as aggressive after treatment. As L-DOPA treatment did not affect general motor activity, the effect appears to be directly associated with aggression. This is supported by the observation that L-DOPA treatment delayed latency to eyespot darkening, which predicts the latency to aggression.","The dopamine (DA) precursor, L-DOPA (500 microg), was injected into living crickets, which were ingested (one each) by adult male Anolis carolinensis.

"The aim of these experiments was to assess whether the clinically validated cognition enhancers donepezil (Aricept, E2020) and metrifonate antagonize scopolamine-induced deficits in the cone field, a complex spatial discrimination task. The cone field task allows measurement of the effects of experimental manipulations on working and reference memory (WM and RM), search strategies, and on the speed and latency to execute the task. The effects of a single administration of donepezil (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg kg(-1), p.o.) and metrifonate (30, 60, and 120 mg kg(-1), p.o.) were investigated in adult Harlan-Wistar rats trained to a stable level of performance and pretreated with scopolamine (0.5 mg kg(-1), i.p. 30 min before training). Scopolamine impaired WM without inducing overt non-cognitive side-effects. Donepezil did not antagonize the scopolamine-induced deficits, whereas metrifonate antagonized the WM deficits at the dose of 60 mg kg(-1), but not at 30 or 120 mg kg(-1).

"The present study evaluated the effect of galanthamine, a selective competitive cholinesterase inhibitor, on histological and functional outcome after experimental stroke in rats. Cholinesterase inhibitors are commonly used as cognitive enhancers for dementia in aged people, including those who may sustain ischemic attacks. Young adult (5 months) and aged (24 months) rats were treated with saline or galanthamine at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg (i.p., once a day). Drug treatment started 4 days before focal cortical photothrombosis (Rose Bengal, 20 mg/kg) and continued for 21 days thereafter. Sensorimotor recovery was assessed by a new beam-walking test and spatial learning by the Morris water-maze over a 3-week follow-up period. Infarct volumes were measured from nitroblue tetrazolium-stained sections at the end of follow-up. Infarct volumes in the cortex were similar in ischemic controls and ischemic rats treated with galanthamine. In the beam-walking test, there was a transient impairment forelimb function and a permanent impairment in hindlimb after cortical infarct both in young adult and aged rats. Galanthamine treatment did not affect the sensorimotor recovery rate. Analysis of water-maze data did not reveal significant differences in length of path, escape latency, or swim speed between sham-operated, ischemic controls and ischemic rats treated with galanthamine. In conclusion, present findings suggest that the aging brain has considerable plastic capacity to maintain functioning after focal cerebral insults restricted to the motor cortex. Galanthamine is not beneficial with respect to the histological or functional outcome in rats subjected to cortical photothrombosis.","The present study evaluated the effect of galanthamine, a selective competitive cholinesterase inhibitor, on histological and functional outcome after experimental stroke in rats.

Sensorimotor recovery was assessed by a new beam-walking test and spatial learning by the Morris water-maze over a 3-week follow-up period. Infarct volumes were measured from nitroblue tetrazolium-stained sections at the end of follow-up.","Infarct volumes in the cortex were similar in ischemic controls and ischemic rats treated with galanthamine. In the beam-walking test, there was a transient impairment forelimb function and a permanent impairment in hindlimb after cortical infarct both in young adult and aged rats. Galanthamine treatment did not affect the sensorimotor recovery rate. Analysis of water-maze data did not reveal significant differences in length of path, escape latency, or swim speed between sham-operated, ischemic controls and ischemic rats treated with galanthamine. In conclusion, present findings suggest that the aging brain has considerable plastic capacity to maintain functioning after focal cerebral insults restricted to the motor cortex.

"The auditory brainstem response reflects neural encoding of the acoustic characteristic of a speech syllable with remarkable precision. Some children with learning impairments demonstrate abnormalities in this preconscious measure of neural encoding especially in background noise. This study investigated whether auditory training targeted to remediate perceptually-based learning problems would alter the neural brainstem encoding of the acoustic sound structure of speech in such children. Nine subjects, clinically diagnosed with a language-based learning problem (e.g., dyslexia), worked with auditory perceptual training software. Prior to beginning and within three months after completing the training program, brainstem responses to the syllable /da/ were recorded in quiet and background noise. Subjects underwent additional auditory neurophysiological, perceptual, and cognitive testing. Ten control subjects, who did not participate in any remediation program, underwent the same battery of tests at time intervals equivalent to the trained subjects. Transient and sustained (frequency-following response) components of the brainstem response were evaluated. The primary pathway afferent volley -- neural events occurring earlier than 11 ms after stimulus onset -- did not demonstrate plasticity. However, quiet-to-noise inter-response correlations of the sustained response ( approximately 11-50 ms) increased significantly in the trained children, reflecting improved stimulus encoding precision, whereas control subjects did not exhibit this change. Thus, auditory training can alter the preconscious neural encoding of complex sounds by improving neural synchrony in the auditory brainstem. Additionally, several measures of brainstem response timing were related to changes in cortical physiology, as well as perceptual, academic, and cognitive measures from pre- to post-training.",The auditory brainstem response reflects neural encoding of the acoustic characteristic of a speech syllable with remarkable precision.

"Repeated stress is an important risk factor for the development of depression. However, the mechanism by which stress influences depression is largely unknown, in part due to the fact that few animal models of repeated stress produce robust changes in depression-like behavior. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the effect of repeated corticosterone (CORT) injections and repeated restraint stress on anxiety and depression-like behavior in male rats. Rats received CORT injections (40 mg/kg, s.c.), vehicle injections, restraint stress (6 h/day), or handling once per day for 21 consecutive days prior to the behavioral testing. The rats were then tested for changes in fearful/anxious behavior in the open-field and social interaction tests and for depression-like behavior in the forced swim test. The repeated CORT injections had no significant effect on activity levels or anxiety in the open-field or social interaction tests. However, they did increase depression-like behaviors in the forced swim test. Repeated restraint stress had no significant effect on anxiety or depression-like behavior on any of the behavioral tests. These results suggest that repeated CORT injections warrant further investigation as an animal model to study the role of stress in depression.","Repeated stress is an important risk factor for the development of depression.

"The investigation explored the olfactory detectability of two chemically and structurally similar esters, ethyl propanoate and ethyl heptanoate, presented singly and in mixtures. Initially, we measured concentration-detection (i.e., psychometric) functions for the odor of ethyl propanoate and ethyl heptanoate presented singly. Using this information, we prepared binary mixtures of the two chemicals in varying complementary proportions and, also, selected concentrations of the single compounds, such that, if a rule of response-addition (i.e., independence of detection) were to hold, the stimuli (mixed and single) should approximate equal detection. Next, we measured the actual detectability of these stimuli within the same experiment. The results were analyzed in terms of response-addition (or -additivity) and of dose-addition (or -additivity). The outcome revealed that at low levels of detectability the mixtures approximate response-addition, that is, independence of detection, whereas at high levels of detectability they approximate dose-addition. In the light of previous findings for the olfactory detection of the more dissimilar chemical pairs 1-butanol/2-heptanone and butyl acetate/toluene, we conclude that the described outcome generalizes across a variety of chemical pairs.","The investigation explored the olfactory detectability of two chemically and structurally similar esters, ethyl propanoate and ethyl heptanoate, presented singly and in mixtures.","Initially, we measured concentration-detection (i.e., psychometric) functions for the odor of ethyl propanoate and ethyl heptanoate presented singly.

"The classical approach to investigating brain contributions to behavior has been to localize function to a region. In clinical investigations, however, injury is frequently multifocal, raising the question of how individual brain regions contribute to a resulting behavioral syndrome. For example, middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemia in humans can concurrently damage a number of cortical and subcortical areas and the same areas are damaged in rat models of MCA stroke. In the rat, MCA occlusion produces severe motor deficits, but the cortical area of damage is the lateral neocortex, sparing motor cortex. This anatomical finding raises the question of whether the rat lateral neocortex contributes to MCA-related motor impairments, a question that was investigated in the present study. Rats received unilateral neocortical lesions via electrocoagulation of the MCA and were compared to rats with standard motor cortex lesions produced by devascaulrization of the overlaying blood vessels. The MCA group was as impaired as the motor cortex group in skilled reaching movements as assessed by quantitative measures of the contralateral-to-lesion forelimb in a single pellet task and in a tray-reaching task. Although there was improvement in success scores over a 2-week period in both groups, the groups were characterized by distinctive and enduring qualitative impairments. The motor cortex deficit was exemplified by use of trunk musculature and head movements to assist the reaching limb while the MCA impairment included sensory abnormalities. The results are discussed in relation to the contribution of lateral frontal cortex injury to MCA stroke sensorimotor syndromes.","The classical approach to investigating brain contributions to behavior has been to localize function to a region.

"This study aimed at investigating the relationship between anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviour in mice. Therefore, we assessed the behaviour of mice from eight different strains (FVB/NA, BALB/c, C57BL/6, DBA/2, 129/Sv, C3H/He, CBA and BA) confronted first to anxiety models (the elevated plus-maze and the free exploratory test) and then to tests of depressive-like behaviours (forced swim test and unpredictable subchronic mild stress). In the forced swim test, mice from the DBA/2, the BA and the C3H/He strains displayed higher immobility than mice from the 129/Sv, the BALB/c, the C57BL/6 and the CBA strains. In the subchronic mild stress, mice from the C57BL/6 and the CBA strains displayed low sensitivity when compared with mice from all the others strains. A stepwise multiple regression analysis suggests that behaviour in the elevated plus-maze is associated with the time of immobility in the forced swim test (20%) and with the susceptibility to the unpredictable subchronic stress procedure (31%). The behaviour in the free exploratory paradigm is slightly associated with behaviours in the two tests of depression.

"A prolonged use of psychostimulants has been suggested to induce long-lasting behavioural sensitisation which plays a role in the acquisition and maintenance of addictive behaviour. A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of repeated oral administration of Catha edulis in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats divided into five groups received: saline, S-(-)-cathinone (1.5 mg/kg), D-(+)-amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg) and standardized C. edulis extract (50 or 200 mg/kg) once daily for nine consecutive days and later challenged with the same psychostimulants after five abstinence days. Then, 2 weeks later, rats were decapitated and the level of neurotransmitters were assessed. Behavioural activities were monitored using activity and sniffing boxes. The results demonstrated that the three psychostimulants induced strong behavioural sensitisation in rats. Whereas, neurotransmitters analyses showed no significant changes in the basal level of dopamine in most of the regions except that C. edulis extract (200 mg/kg) significantly reduced the level of DA, DOPAC and HVA in the anterior caudate putamen (P &lt; 0.05).

"The rewarding effect produced by electrically stimulating certain sites in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) can be potentiated by food restriction and body weight loss in lean rats. Central leptin and insulin administration can suppress the rewarding impact of the stimulation. To determine whether there are additional peripheral signals that mediate the effect of weight loss on brain reward circuitry, we assessed changes in LH-self-stimulation following food restriction in the obese Zucker rat which develops resistance to circulating leptin and insulin. In addition, we examined the impact of acute food deprivation and leptin administration on LH self-stimulation in lean and obese Zucker rats. The number of brain stimulation rewards earned was measured over a range of LH stimulation frequencies that drove reward rates from zero to asymptotic levels. Restriction reduced frequency thresholds in a subset of lean and obese rats, whereas BSR was unaltered by acute food deprivation. Despite impairment in leptin signaling, intraventricular leptin (4 microg) increased thresholds in most lean and obese rats in which the rewarding effect was sensitive to restriction. These results show that brain reward circuitry in the obese Zucker rat is sensitive to weight loss and leptin.","The rewarding effect produced by electrically stimulating certain sites in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) can be potentiated by food restriction and body weight loss in lean rats.

"In the teleost fish Girardinus falcatus eye preferences for inspecting a potential predator is highly heritable and this consented to select lines with opposed laterality. In previous studies individuals from a RD line (rightward turning when facing a dummy predator) and those from a LD line (leftward turning) were subjected to several other laterality tests (most of which, possibly all, were visually based). Since they obtained opposite scores in all tests, it was suggested that LD and RD fish have complete mirror-reversed organizations of the brain. Here, we studied fish from selected lines in a new set of laterality tests including some non-visual tests. They included measures of (1) rotational preference in the home tank (2) direction of spontaneous swimming in the dark (3) escape trajectories after delivery of an auditory stimulus (4) escape turning direction to a fast approaching visual stimulus. The results of the first three tests are congruent with the finding of previous studies in that fishes of the two lines showed opposite direction of lateralisation. When tested for laterality in the escape response to a fast approaching stimulus, fish of the LD and RD lines showed no differences and both were biased toward leftward escape. Overall these results suggest the existence in G. falcatus of a single mechanism controlling a co-ordinate placement of the great majority of lateralised functions. Yet the results of the fourth test suggest that a few lateralized functions are controlled by different mechanisms that were unaffected by artificial selection.","In the teleost fish Girardinus falcatus eye preferences for inspecting a potential predator is highly heritable and this consented to select lines with opposed laterality.

"The causes of nigrostriatal neuron degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) are not known, but it has been suggested that exogenous or endogenous factors or neurotoxins may play a role. The degree of vulnerability to neurotoxins or other potential mediators of nigral dopamine cell death is thought to be important in understanding Parkinson's disease. In most animal models, the rate of terminal degeneration and corresponding functional impairment is too rapid to investigate effectively either cell vulnerability or the potential benefits of some neuroprotective treatments. In the present study, a new model of Parkinson's disease is described that might help in addressing the issue of nigral cell vulnerability and to evaluate interventions with clinical potential. 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was infused in escalating, intrastriatal doses over several weeks. Control animals received multiple infusions of vehicle at the same volume. Behavioral testing was carried out between each infusion, including forelimb-use and somatosensory function. A symptomatic threshold was established for each animal, indicating the amount of neurotoxin required to induce a stable deficit. Oral administration of L-DOPA (Sinemet) ameliorated limb-use asymmetries acutely. An immunocytochemical assay for tyrosine hydroxylase, a dopamine cell marker, revealed a partial loss of immunoreactive cells in the substantia nigra. Animals that were co-administered methylphenidate (MPH), a dopamine transport inhibitor, along with the 6-OHDA were spared from the behavioral and neurochemical effects of 6-OHDA, despite receiving more than twice as much neurotoxin as controls. These data suggest that establishing a symptomatic threshold preclinically may help researchers evaluate potential treatments and model individual and group resistance to nigrostriatal insults.","The causes of nigrostriatal neuron degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) are not known, but it has been suggested that exogenous or endogenous factors or neurotoxins may play a role.

In most animal models, the rate of terminal degeneration and corresponding functional impairment is too rapid to investigate effectively either cell vulnerability or the potential benefits of some neuroprotective treatments.","In the present study, a new model of Parkinson's disease is described that might help in addressing the issue of nigral cell vulnerability and to evaluate interventions with clinical potential. 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was infused in escalating, intrastriatal doses over several weeks. Control animals received multiple infusions of vehicle at the same volume. Behavioral testing was carried out between each infusion, including forelimb-use and somatosensory function. A symptomatic threshold was established for each animal, indicating the amount of neurotoxin required to induce a stable deficit.","Oral administration of L-DOPA (Sinemet) ameliorated limb-use asymmetries acutely. An immunocytochemical assay for tyrosine hydroxylase, a dopamine cell marker, revealed a partial loss of immunoreactive cells in the substantia nigra. Animals that were co-administered methylphenidate (MPH), a dopamine transport inhibitor, along with the 6-OHDA were spared from the behavioral and neurochemical effects of 6-OHDA, despite receiving more than twice as much neurotoxin as controls. These data suggest that establishing a symptomatic threshold preclinically may help researchers evaluate potential treatments and model individual and group resistance to nigrostriatal insults.",1,1,1,"Oral administration of L-DOPA (Sinemet) reduced limb-use asymmetries acutely.

"The hippocampus is believed to play an important role in spatial cognition and anxiety. Much of the supporting evidence is derived from rat studies. Recent reports on hippocampal lesioned mice also showed impairments in spatial function, but anxiety was not uniformly diminished. There were, however, striking impairments in several ""species typical"" behaviours; lesioned mice made poorer nests, and hoarded and burrowed less. In the present experiments, mice with excitotoxic hippocampal lesions were tested in a well-established anxiety paradigm, the light-dark box. As in previous anxiety tests, the results were mixed; some measures (reduced dark time) suggested lesioned mice were less anxious; others (fewer light-dark transits) suggested greater anxiety. However, lesioned mice only made fewer transits when the door was small. This suggested that the tendency to enter small holes, so characteristic of small rodents, was reduced; subsequent tests showed lesioned mice preferred to explore in an alley rather than enter its attached tunnels. Further tests of ""species typical"" behaviours revealed that lesioned mice spent less time digging and climbing, and made less use of cardboard shelters in their cages. This was not due to inactivity; lesions did not reduce grooming or locomotion. Finally, tests of hyponeophagia showed hippocampal lesions reduced this measure of anxiety, so long as the control baseline was sufficiently high. Overall, the results suggest that the hippocampus is important in many species-typical behaviours, potentially influencing performance in a range of behavioural tests. However, species-typical behaviours offer easy and economical ways to test for hippocampal dysfunction, for example, in genetically modified mice.","The hippocampus is believed to play an important role in spatial cognition and anxiety.

"Transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been recently advanced. Tg2576 mice have been shown to develop progressive beta-amyloid (Abeta) neuritic plaques and exhibit impairment of cognitive function. The aim of this study was a better characterization of different aspects of spatial memory performance of transgenic mice, observed at a time when levels of soluble Abeta are elevated and Abeta neuritc plaques start to appear. A general elevation of basal locomotory activity in the home cage was found in Tg2576 mice, which also exhibited an impairment of spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze test. Tg2576 mice were not flexible upon changes in the schedule and failed to codify spatially the testing environment. Consistently, a deficit of spatial memory was also observed when mice were assessed for levels of reactivity to spatial change in the modified open-field test with objects. Compared to controls, Tg2576 mice also exhibited an increased number of explorative approaches to the different objects, and failed to discriminate the displacement of the object. Consistently with the hypothesis of increased disinhibition, a differential behavioural response to the plus-maze paradigm was exhibited by Tg2576 mice. Results clearly indicate that Tg2576 mice are characterized by a number of specific behavioral cognitive alterations, compatible with Alzheimer's disease (AD), which make them a suitable animal model for testing of novel anti-AD drugs.","Transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been recently advanced.

"There is a body of evidence implying the involvement of the glutamatergic system in the conditioned rewarding effects of drugs of abuse. It is recognized that the release of extracellular glutamate from nerve terminals is counterbalanced by the functions of neuronal and glial glutamate transporters. In the present study, we investigated the effects of (R)-(-)-5-methyl-1-nicotinoyl-2-pyrazoline (MS-153), a glutamate transporter activator, on the induction of the conditioned place preference to morphine, methamphetamine and cocaine in mice. In the conditioned place preference paradigm, mice were conditioned with repeated subcutaneous injections of morphine (5 mg/kg), methamphetamine (2 mg/kg) or cocaine (8 mg/kg) in combination with or without MS-153 (3 and 10 mg/kg). Co-administration of MS-153 at a dose of 10 mg/kg, but not 3 mg/kg, significantly attenuated the induction of conditioned place preference to morphine, methamphetamine and cocaine. However, MS-153 itself produced neither conditioned place preference nor aversion. On the other hand, co-administration of MS-153 (10 mg/kg) did not alter the acute locomotor activation elicited by a single injection of morphine, methamphetamine and cocaine. These results suggest that MS-153, a glutamate transporter activator, has an inhibitory effect on the conditioned rewarding effects of morphine, methamphetamine and cocaine without affecting their acute locomotor responses.",There is a body of evidence implying the involvement of the glutamatergic system in the conditioned rewarding effects of drugs of abuse.

"The effects of the cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) metrifonate and donepezil were assessed on spatial performance of rats with bilateral lesions of the entorhinal cortex (EC), which is thought to model early changes in the brains of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we found that spatial discrimination deficits in rats, induced by bilateral ibotenic acid (IBO) lesions of the EC region can partially be antagonised by treatment with the cholinesterase inhibitors metrifonate (30 mg kg(-1)) and donepezil (0.3 and 3 mg kg(-1)). Performance was improved in the spatial discrimination task compared with that of the EC-lesioned control group. It is concluded that the rat with bilateral EC lesions is a suitable deficit model for the assessment of effects of putative Alzheimer therapeutics.","The effects of the cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) metrifonate and donepezil were assessed on spatial performance of rats with bilateral lesions of the entorhinal cortex (EC), which is thought to model early changes in the brains of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease.","In the present study, we found that spatial discrimination deficits in rats, induced by bilateral ibotenic acid (IBO) lesions of the EC region can partially be antagonised by treatment with the cholinesterase inhibitors metrifonate (30 mg kg(-1)) and donepezil (0.3 and 3 mg kg(-1)).",Performance was improved in the spatial discrimination task compared with that of the EC-lesioned control group.

"In most mammals, the hippocampus has a well-documented role in spatial memory acquisition. High concentration of androgen receptors in fundamental centers of learning and memory in brain such as hippocampus shows that there may be some relationships between androgen receptors and cognitive aspects of brain. Previous studies, which have shown sex-dependent differences in hippocampal morphology and physiology, suggest a modulatory role for sex steroids in hippocampal function. Androgens have been shown to modulate some hippocampal-mediated behaviors including learning and memory. To study the mechanism of action of androgens in processes underlying learning and memory, anisomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor was used to prevent the genomic effects of testosterone. Therefore, the effects of anisomycin and testosterone together were assessed on rat's performance in MWM. Rats received anisomycin (2.5 microg/0.5 microl), testosterone (80 microg/0.5 microl) or both anisomycin (2.5 microg/0.5 microl) and testosterone (80 microg/0.5 microl) through the connulas in the CA1 region. Anisomycin was injected 20 min and testosterone was injected 35 min before training each day. The results showed that anisomycin (2.5 microg/0.5 microl) and testosterone (80 microg/0.5 microl) increased latencies to find the invisible platform. But the group that received testosterone and anisomycin together was decrease in latency and traveled distance to find the invisible platform.","In most mammals, the hippocampus has a well-documented role in spatial memory acquisition.

"Stressful experiences during development cause long-lasting changes in neuroendocrine systems as well as lasting changes in behavior. The present study examines the long-term consequences of daily periods of social isolation during the third postnatal week on radial arm maze performance in adulthood. Male rat pups were either isolated for 6 h per day between postnatal days 15-21 or remained in the home cage. This manipulation caused a significant increase in plasma corticosterone during the isolation period. As adults, these animals were tested on a 12-arm radial arm maze. Rats that experienced social isolation during development made more working memory errors during initial acquisition but reached an asymptotic level of performance comparable to controls. The pattern of reference memory errors across testing was comparable to the pattern of working memory errors, though the difference between isolated and control animals was not significant. Blood samples taken in adulthood revealed that social isolation during development results in an long-term elevation in plasma corticosterone levels. These findings indicate that isolation stress during the third week of life leads to lasting impairments in cognition and HPA axis activity and suggest a potential alteration in hippocampal function.",Stressful experiences during development cause long-lasting changes in neuroendocrine systems as well as lasting changes in behavior.,"The present study examines the long-term consequences of daily periods of social isolation during the third postnatal week on radial arm maze performance in adulthood.

"Learned irrelevance (LIrr) is closely related to latent inhibition (LI). In LI a to-be-conditioned stimulus (CS) is prexposed alone prior to the opportunity to learn an association between the CS and an unconditioned stimulus (UCS). In LIrr preexposure consists of intermixed presentations of both CS and UCS in a random relationship to each other. In both paradigms preexposure leads in normal subjects to reduced or retarded learning of the CS-UCS association. Acute schizophrenics fail to show LI. LI is usually demonstrated as a one-off, between-groups difference in trials to learning, so posing problems for neuroimaging. We have developed a novel, continuous, within-subject paradigm in which normal subjects show robust and repeated LIrr. We show that this paradigm is suitable for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and gives rise, in normal subjects, to activation in the hippocampal formation, consistent with data from animal experiments on LI. We also report, consistent with previous studies of LI, loss (indeed, significant reversal) of LIrr in acute (first 2 weeks of current psychotic episode) schizophrenics. Chronic schizophrenics failed to demonstrate learning, precluding measurement in this group of LIrr. These findings establish the likely value of the new paradigm for neuroimaging studies of attentional dysfunction in acute schizophrenia.","Learned irrelevance (LIrr) is closely related to latent inhibition (LI).

"Early life adversity can lead to increased vulnerability to psychiatric disease including depression, with symptoms of depressed mood, impaired coping with negative events, anhedonia, reduced appetite, and elevated stress hormone activity. In rats, postnatal manipulation studies have focused on behavioural and endocrine anxiety effects, and have demonstrated that mild pup stimulation in the form of early handling (EH) is chronically anxiolytic relative to no stimulation in the form of non-handling (NH). Furthermore, apparently severe manipulations in the form of 3-4 h daily litter-dam separation (maternal separation) or pup-litter-dam separation (early deprivation, ED) are either without effect or even EH-like, relative to NH. In this Wistar rat study, we investigated the effects of ED under different circadian and thermal conditions on adulthood behavioural and endocrine responsiveness to environmental challenge, relative to NH. ED was performed on days 1-14, during either the Light or Dark phase and at either 21 degrees C (cold) or 32 degrees C (warm). Dark-cold ED adults exhibited reduced motivation to obtain sucrose in a progressive ratio schedule, tended to be less mobile in a forced swim test, but did not exhibit an escape deficit in a foot-shock pre-exposure/shuttle box test, or altered basal or stress endocrine activity. Light ED was completely without effect on adult phenotype. Even relative to stringent NH comparison, dark-cold ED leads to a long-term trait of mild gustatory anhedonia in Wistar rats.","Early life adversity can lead to increased vulnerability to psychiatric disease including depression, with symptoms of depressed mood, impaired coping with negative events, anhedonia, reduced appetite, and elevated stress hormone activity.

"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is most prevalent in children and young adults. The long-term effects of pediatric TBI include cognitive and behavioral impairments; however, over time, it is difficult to distinguish individual variability in intellect and behavior from sequelae of early injury. Postnatal day (PND) 19 rats underwent lateral fluid percussion (FP) injury, followed by rearing in either standard (STD) or enriched environment (EE) conditions. The hypothesis was that the traditional enhancement of cognitive functioning following EE rearing would be attenuated when this rearing is preceded by TBI at PND19. Thirty days after injury, Morris water maze (MWM) acquisition and subsequent probe trial retention were used to assess the behavioral effects of injury on experience-dependent plasticity induced by housing in EE at two different time windows. MWM acquisition demonstrated improvements following early EE rearing in both sham and injured animals; however, the degree of improvement was greater for uninjured animals. When EE rearing was delayed for 2 weeks after injury, the injury effect was absent and the effect of rearing even stronger. Memory testing in the early EE groups using a delayed probe trial showed an effect of injury and housing, with the sham EE animals benefiting the most. After the delayed EE, sham EE animals again showed more probe target hits, while FPEE animals did not, demonstrating an enduring memory deficit. These data confirm that early TBI has effects on experience-dependent plasticity resulting in long-term neurobehavioral deficits. In addition, the ability to benefit from environmental stimulation following TBI is dependent upon time after injury.","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is most prevalent in children and young adults.

"Ins2C96Y Akita mice represent a model of spontaneous early-onset diabetes mellitus, expressing a mutant non-functional isoform of insulin. These mice are characterized by a reduced number of pancreatic beta cells resulting in hypoinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. We obtained longitudinal measures of morning fasting blood glucose levels and gait performance. Sciatic nerve electrophysiology was also performed and the performance of these mice on spatial memory tasks was measured longitudinally. We observed a progressive increase in fasting blood glucose levels that was proportionally associated with increased gait disturbances. Diabetes induced a decrease in the sensory nerve conduction velocity up to the age of 40 weeks. Glucose transporter (GLUT) 3 levels were reduced in the hippocampus of the aged Ins2C96Y Akita mice. However, we failed to detect any significant deficits during reference, reversal or probe tests in the Morris water maze or in a spontaneous alternation task up to the age of 34 weeks old.

"Adult C57BL/6 mice received uni- or bilateral cryogenic or sham-lesions over the barrel field and their exploratory behaviour was assessed in an open field between 1 and 7 days post-lesion. Bilateral cortical lesions produced a short-lasting increase in thigmotactic scanning with both sides of the face on the first day of testing. Mice with a unilateral barrel-cortex lesion showed more contralateral wall scanning with a recovery to behavioural symmetry after 5-7 days. Furthermore, the increase in contralateral thigmotaxis was most pronounced in animals with damage to the left barrel field, indicative of a lateralization of the lesion-induced behavioural changes. The cortical lesions did not influence locomotor activity and the rate of habituation to the open field (habituation 'learning'). Referring to recent electrophysiological findings, we hypothesize that the lesion established a lateralized source of increased neuronal excitability within the affected barrel-cortex, leading to more behaviour with its corresponding vibrissae. Alternatively, if the lesion results in contralateral 'neglect' in terms of input, the increased scanning with the affected vibrissae may reflect an attempt of the system to compensate for this with an increase in usage.",Adult C57BL/6 mice received uni- or bilateral cryogenic or sham-lesions over the barrel field and their exploratory behaviour was assessed in an open field between 1 and 7 days post-lesion.,"Bilateral cortical lesions produced a short-lasting increase in thigmotactic scanning with both sides of the face on the first day of testing.

After behavioral testing, density of cholinergic fibers and sizes of the mossy fiber terminal fields in the hippocampus and number of cholinergic and GABAergic neurons in the septal area were quantified. In the radial arm maze CORT-treated animals initially showed better working memory performance than controls. However, control animals showed a significant improvement of spatial working memory in the last trials and reached similar working memory scores as compared to treated animals. At neither day of training differences in reference memory errors were found between groups. In the diagonal band of Broca, both numbers of cholinergic and GABAergic neurons were increased after corticosterone treatment. The fiber systems in hippocampus showed no significant differences between groups. In conclusion, early postnatal stress induced by CORT administration in neonatal rats results in mild, yet significant morphological and behavioral changes in later life.","In the present study new-born rats were treated with corticosterone (CORT) between postnatal days 1 and 12.

"A number of studies suggest melanocortin (MC) system involvement in nociceptive modulation. Although the mechanism through which this occurs is still unknown, experimental evidence would suggest a primary role of MC4 receptors. To further investigate the implication of this MC receptor subtype in chronic pain, we have studied the effects of several MC antagonists on spinal nerve ligation-induced nociceptive behavior in rats. The intrathecal injection of synthetic antagonists with different selectivity to MC4 receptor and of an endogenous antagonist (Agouti related protein; AgRP) reduced mechanical allodynia in neuropathic rats, as measured by von Frey hair test. Treatments produced an anti-allodynic effect at the dose of 1.5 nmol (25-30% maximum possible effect, MPE, P&lt;0.05). To further investigate the possible physiological role of AgRP in pain modulation we studied its expression in both sham and neuropathic rat spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) by quantitative real time PCR and immunohistochemistry. AgRP was present in both spinal cord and DRG, and its expression, was unchanged in neuropathic animals. In conclusion MC4 receptor antagonists with different selectivity profile, induce anti-allodynic effects in one of the most relevant neuropathic pain model. In addition the expression of AgRP in spinal cord and DRG suggests an endogenous tonic inhibitory control on MC system activity. In pathological conditions this steady control could be insufficient to cope with an over activated MC system leading to increase in nociception. These data suggest that targeting MC4 with synthetic antagonists could restore the balance and hence reduce nociception.","A number of studies suggest melanocortin (MC) system involvement in nociceptive modulation.

"Various lesion studies demonstrated that trace but not delay fear conditioning requires an intact hippocampal formation. Our present study examined the role of NMDA receptor activation and protein synthesis within the dorsal hippocampus for acquisition of fear memories following trace (5-s trace) and delay conditioning. To this end male C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice were chronically implanted with guide cannulae targeting the dorsal hippocampus. Fifteen minutes before conditioning mice received a bilateral intrahippocampal injection of either the NMDA receptor antagonist AP5 (0.5 or 1 microg per 0.5 microl per side) or of anisomycin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis (62.5 microg per 0.5 microl per side). Control mice were treated with vehicle (Ringer's solution). Blocking NMDA receptors before trace but not delay conditioning dose-dependently attenuated the freezing response to the tone as assessed 24 h after conditioning. The same findings were obtained after blocking protein synthesis within the dorsal hippocampus.

"Previous studies in humans have demonstrated a high co-morbidity between alcoholism and smoking. This co-morbidity between alcohol and nicotine dependence can be attributed, in part, to common genetic factors. In rodents, behavioral and physiological responses to alcohol and nicotine also appear to share common genetic influences. In this report, the genetic correlation between free-choice oral nicotine and oral alcohol consumption was evaluated using an ascending two-bottle choice paradigm in C57BL/6xC3H/HeJ F2 intercross mice. For all concentrations of nicotine (25, 50, and 100 microg/ml) and alcohol (3, 6, and 10%) tested, nicotine consumption was significantly correlated with alcohol consumption. Nicotine consumption at the highest nicotine concentration tested (100 microg/ml) showed low, but significant, correlations with the number of [3H]-cytisine binding sites in the hippocampus (r=0.307) and the number of [125I]-alpha-bungarotoxin binding sites in the cortex (r=-0.328). No significant correlations between alcohol consumption and the number of either [3H]-cytisine or [125I]-alpha-bungarotoxin binding sites was observed. A polymorphism in the nicotinic receptor alpha4 subunit gene, Chrna4, showed a trend with nicotine consumption and a significant association with alcohol consumption in female but not male mice. These results indicate that common genetic factors influence nicotine and alcohol consumption in mice. However, neither individual differences in the expression of [3H]-cytisine or [125I]-alpha-bungarotoxin binding nicotinic receptors nor the polymorphism in Chrna4 likely contribute to the genetic overlap that influences the consumption of both of these drugs of abuse in C57BL/6xC3H/HeJ F2 mice.","Previous studies in humans have demonstrated a high co-morbidity between alcoholism and smoking.

"Latent inhibition (LI) is a phenomenon by which pre-exposure of a conditioned stimulus (CS) prior to the CS-unconditioned stimulus (US) pairings retards conditioned responding (CR). LI has been demonstrated in a variety of learning tasks including conditioned taste aversion (CTA). Earlier work has shown that systemic administration of 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), a selective metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) antagonist, is able to disrupt classical conditioning in CTA. The present study investigated the involvement of mGlu5 receptors in LI using a CTA procedure. In the first experiment, rats received either water (non-pre-exposed, NPE) or a saccharin solution (pre-exposed, PE) on 2 consecutive days. The animals then received conditioning in which a fixed amount of saccharin was paired with lithium chloride and then the CR to the taste was tested. Either MPEP (3, 6, 12 mg/kg) or vehicle was injected intraperitoneally prior to taste pre-exposure or testing. Animals in the vehicle control groups displayed LI. MPEP injections before pre-exposure trials attenuated LI but also reduced consumption during pre-exposure, which obscured interpretation of the LI effect. The second experiment used four pre-exposure trials and controlled access to fixed amount of the solutions during the pre-exposure as well as the conditioning trials. Rats were injected before pre-exposure trials but not before the test trial. The results found that MPEP attenuates latent inhibition suggesting that the mGlu5 receptor exerts an influence on the processes that underlie the effects of taste pre-exposure on conditioning.","Latent inhibition (LI) is a phenomenon by which pre-exposure of a conditioned stimulus (CS) prior to the CS-unconditioned stimulus (US) pairings retards conditioned responding (CR).

"Working memory of chicks was probed in a delayed-response task, with either object- or position-specific information available in order to locate a goal that had disappeared behind one of two screens in a test arena. When the position of the correct screen was the only available cue (i.e., the two screens were identical) binocular and monocular chicks could easily locate the goal, and the same occurred when the visual characteristics of the screens (no matter what their spatial position) were the only relevant information available and when object- and position-specific cues were both available and in agreement (i.e., the two screens were different and maintained fixed spatial locations). In contrast, when object- and position-specific cues were available but were put in conflict (the two screens were different and were swapped during the delay time) left-eyed and binocular chicks went to the correct position, whereas right-eyed chicks seemed to choose both the correct spatial position and the correct object cue to the same degree. When during the delay the correct screen was substituted by an entirely novel screen, no left-right asymmetry associated with response to novelty was observed; monocular chicks preferentially approached the novel screen in the correct position, whereas binocular chicks did not show any clear choice. The results suggest that both object- and position-specific information is available to the two cerebral hemispheres in working memory tasks; however, when a conflict between cues arises, the right hemisphere preferentially attends to position-specific cues, whereas the left hemisphere tends to attend to object-specific cues.","Working memory of chicks was probed in a delayed-response task, with either object- or position-specific information available in order to locate a goal that had disappeared behind one of two screens in a test arena.","When the position of the correct screen was the only available cue (i.e., the two screens were identical) binocular and monocular chicks could easily locate the goal, and the same occurred when the visual characteristics of the screens (no matter what their spatial position) were the only relevant information available and when object- and position-specific cues were both available and in agreement (i.e., the two screens were different and maintained fixed spatial locations).

"In differential reinforcement of low rates of responding (DRL) tasks, animals are trained to respond for rewards that become available only after some set time has elapsed since the animal's previous response. DRL performance is impaired by hippocampal lesions regardless of their precise location, and can be measured using automated operant equipment, whereas spatial tasks are selectively impaired by dorsal, but not ventral hippocampal lesions, and are typically conducted by hand. Earlier studies of prion infection following dorsal hippocampal micro-injections of scrapie have shown clear impairments of spatial alternation, but these occurred significantly later than dysfunction in hippocampus-dependent 'domestic' tasks such as nesting or burrowing. In the present experiment, mice were trained to respond on an automated DRL schedule prior to dorsal hippocampal ME7 scrapie injection. Post-operative DRL performance was monitored, along with performance on 'domestic' and other tests, which provided additional measures of disease progression. Animals with scrapie developed a clear DRL deficit at approximately the same time as their deficits on the other tests became apparent, and long before clinical signs were detectable. DRL deficits thus appeared earlier in the sequence of disease progression than previously reported for spatial alternation, suggesting that early signs of scrapie infection are caused in part by neuronal dysfunction extending beyond the dorsal hippocampal region of initial infection.","In differential reinforcement of low rates of responding (DRL) tasks, animals are trained to respond for rewards that become available only after some set time has elapsed since the animal's previous response.

"The processing of emotional and/or fear-related events is abnormal in patients with Alzheimer's disease. AD is accompanied by a number of neuropathological features, one of which is the deposition of amyloid plaques. The main aim of the present study was to examine the effects of a human amyloid precursor protein mutation on both the acquisition and expression of fear conditioning in Tg2576 mice. Sixteen-month-old, but not 4-month-old, transgenic mice showed aberrations in post-shock freezing during training. In a retention test carried out 24 h after training, Tg2576 mice showed comparable levels of conditioned fear elicited by contextual cues. However, freezing elicited by a tone conditioned stimulus was impaired in 16-month-old but not 4-month-old Tg2576 mice. The results are discussed with reference to the role of cue competition (overshadowing) in revealing fear conditioning deficits in Tg2576 mice.","The processing of emotional and/or fear-related events is abnormal in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

"In order to understand the physiological role of serotonin in regulating aggressive behaviour it is important to understand how this neuromodulator acts within the context of a naturally fluctuating social and physical environment. To accomplish this, we examined the effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine during the breeding season in free-living male American tree sparrows (Spizella arborea) in Northern Alaska. During this time period males are maximally aggressive towards territorial intruders. Male, territorial sparrows were injected with either vehicle or a 10 mg/kg dose of fluoxetine. One hour later, aggression was measured using a simulated territorial intrusion. Depending upon when birds were sampled, the aggression scores for vehicle and fluoxetine treatments were grouped according to the number of days after territorial behaviour was initiated. The three groups were: early, days 1-5; middle, days 6-10; and late, days 11-15. There was a significant overall difference between groups (F(5,36)=5.18, P&lt;0.0015). Post hoc analysis demonstrated that the level of aggression did not differ between the three groups of saline injected birds. However, fluoxetine injected birds showed a time dependent decrease in aggression. When compared to control birds the middle and late fluoxetine groups had significantly less aggression. Furthermore, the late group of fluoxetine treated birds were significantly less aggressive than the early group of fluoxetine birds. This demonstrates that free-living male ATSPs show a rapid change in their behavioural response to fluoxetine across the first 2 weeks of the breeding season. The rapidity of the change in responsiveness suggests a dynamic sensitivity of the serotonergic system.","In order to understand the physiological role of serotonin in regulating aggressive behaviour it is important to understand how this neuromodulator acts within the context of a naturally fluctuating social and physical environment.

"By using Fos immunocytochemistry, we investigated the activation in olfactory-related areas at three stages (the first and fourth days of conditioning and complete acquisition) of an olfactory discrimination learning task. The trained rats (T) had to associate one odour of a pair with water-reward within a four-arm maze whereas pseudo-trained (P) rats were only submitted to the olfactory cues without any reinforcement. In the piriform cortex, both T and P rats exhibited a higher immunoreactivity on the first day, which seemed to indicate a novelty-related Fos expression in this area, but whatever the learning-stage, no significant difference in Fos expression between T and P rats was observed. In hippocampus, Fos expression was significantly different between T and P rats in CA1 and CA3 on the first and fourth days respectively. Thus we showed a differential activation of CA1 and CA3 subfields which might support a possible functional heterogeneity. In the orbitofrontal cortex, Fos immunoreactivity was significantly higher in T rats compared to P rats when mastery of the discrimination task was complete. In contrast, no learning-related Fos expression was found in infralimbic and prelimbic cortices.

"Latent inhibition (LI) is a behavioural procedure in which preexposure to a stimulus not followed by reinforcement retards subsequent conditioning to this stimulus when it is paired with reinforcement. Changes in LI thus reflect greater or lesser retardation of learning which essentially implies a potentiation or an attenuation of the LI effect. LI has proved sensitive to psychotomimetic and antipsychotic treatment, which has encouraged its use to model learning and attention deficits in schizophrenia. In the present study, experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of the psychotomimetic drug, phencyclidine (PCP, 2 mg/kg), and compare it with D-amphetamine (D-AMP, 0.33 and 1 mg/kg), on LI using a conditioned taste aversion procedure. PCP was found to potentiate LI when administered acutely prior to the conditioning trails, while no such effect was observed when administered prior to the preexposure trials. D-AMP, on the other hand, disrupted LI possibly due to a failure to induce a persistent taste aversion conditioning.","Latent inhibition (LI) is a behavioural procedure in which preexposure to a stimulus not followed by reinforcement retards subsequent conditioning to this stimulus when it is paired with reinforcement.

"Severe perinatal hypoxia-ischemia is an important cause of brain injury in both full-term and premature newborns, with a high risk of future behavioral and neurological deficits. The most commonly used animal model of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia is the unilateral ligation of the common carotid artery followed by exposure to hypoxia in 7-day-old rats. In spite of the wide use of this model, lot of contradictions and discrepancies exist between the results obtained by different laboratories regarding behavioral deficits and there are no data regarding the possible delay of the appearance of neurological reflexes and the time-course of reflex performances following neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury in rats. In the present study we showed that neonatal hypoxia-ischemia retarded the development of somatic growth and several neurological reflexes (ear twitch, grasping, gait and negative geotaxis). Hypoxic animals also displayed retarded performance in righting, geotaxis and gait reflexes. Although hypoxic pups performed worse in most tests for motor coordination, they reached normal levels by 5 weeks of age except in the footfault test. In the open-field, hypoxic animals were generally more active, except at 3 weeks, when activity of normal pups increased enormously as well. Brain areas were significantly reduced in hypoxic animals, but no close correlation was found with behavioral deficits.","Severe perinatal hypoxia-ischemia is an important cause of brain injury in both full-term and premature newborns, with a high risk of future behavioral and neurological deficits. The most commonly used animal model of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia is the unilateral ligation of the common carotid artery followed by exposure to hypoxia in 7-day-old rats. In spite of the wide use of this model, lot of contradictions and discrepancies exist between the results obtained by different laboratories regarding behavioral deficits and there are no data regarding the possible delay of the appearance of neurological reflexes and the time-course of reflex performances following neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury in rats.","In the present study we showed that neonatal hypoxia-ischemia retarded the development of somatic growth and several neurological reflexes (ear twitch, grasping, gait and negative geotaxis).","Hypoxic animals also displayed retarded performance in righting, geotaxis and gait reflexes. Although hypoxic pups performed worse in most tests for motor coordination, they reached normal levels by 5 weeks of age except in the footfault test.

"The SHIRPA primary screen comprises 40 measures covering various reflexes and basic sensorimotor functions. This multi-test battery was used to compare non-transgenic controls with APP23 transgenic mice, expressing the 751 isoform of human beta-amyloid precursor protein and characterized by amyloid deposits in parenchyma and vessel walls. The APP23 mice were distinguishable from controls by pathological limb reflexes, myoclonic jumping, seizure activity, and tail malformation. In addition, this mouse model of Alzheimer's disease was also marked by a crooked swimming trajectory. APP23 mice were also of lighter weight and were less inclined to stay immobile during a transfer arousal test. Despite the neurologic signs, APP23 transgenic mice were not deficient in stationary beam, coat-hanger, and rotorod tests, indicating intact motor coordination abilities.",The SHIRPA primary screen comprises 40 measures covering various reflexes and basic sensorimotor functions.,"This multi-test battery was used to compare non-transgenic controls with APP23 transgenic mice, expressing the 751 isoform of human beta-amyloid precursor protein and characterized by amyloid deposits in parenchyma and vessel walls.","The APP23 mice were distinguishable from controls by pathological limb reflexes, myoclonic jumping, seizure activity, and tail malformation.

"Our previous work has revealed very high baseline neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of wood mice as compared particularly to bank voles; a difference which may be related to learning capacity. This study explored whether the newly-developed Intellicage system could be used to compare these species in simple spatial learning paradigms. The Intellicage is essentially a group-housing cage that also allows continuous automatic recording of each individual's behaviour. Seven wild-caught bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) were compared with seven wild-caught long-tailed wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) in the Intellicage system over 9 days. During the first 90 min after entering the cage, the wood mice were substantially more exploratory than the bank voles (P = 0.003). Over subsequent days, both species showed nocturnal activity increases with voles being 3.7 times more active overall. In the spatial learning paradigms, there were significant species-by-time interactions with wood mice outperforming bank voles on both place learning (P = 0.027) and subsequent reversal (P = 0.006). Conclusions are firstly that the wood mice show superior learning abilities in this paradigm, and secondly that the Intellicage serves as a valuable cognitive testing arena for small wild rodents, or for circumstances where cognition must be compared independent of different responses to handling or novel environments.",Our previous work has revealed very high baseline neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of wood mice as compared particularly to bank voles; a difference which may be related to learning capacity.,"This study explored whether the newly-developed Intellicage system could be used to compare these species in simple spatial learning paradigms.

"Gap junction channels, composed of connexin (Cx) proteins, are conduits for intercellular communication and metabolic exchange in the central nervous system. Connexin36 (Cx36) is expressed in distinct subpopulations of neurons throughout the mammalian brain. Deletion of the Cx36 gene in the mouse affected power and frequency of gamma and sharp wave-ripple oscillations, putative correlates of memory engram inscription. Here, we present a behavioral analysis of Cx36-deficient mice. Activity patterns, exploratory- and anxiety-related responses were largely unaffected by elimination of Cx36, while sensorimotor capacities and learning and memory processes were impaired. Repeated testing on the rotarod suggested that the Cx36-deficient mice showed slower motor-coordination learning. After a retention interval of 24 h the Cx36-deficient mice showed habituation to an open-field, but failed to habituate to a more complex spatial environment (Y-maze). A more pronounced memory impairment was found when Cx36 knockout mice had to remember recently explored objects. Cx36-deficient mice were unable to recognize objects after short delays of 15 and 45 min. These data suggest that lack of Cx36 induces memory impairments that vary in dependence of the complexity of the stimuli presented. Our results suggest that neuronal gap junctions incorporating Cx36 play a role in learning and memory.","Gap junction channels, composed of connexin (Cx) proteins, are conduits for intercellular communication and metabolic exchange in the central nervous system.

"5HT(2A/2C) and 5HT(3) receptors have an important role in cognitive behavior specially in spatial learning and memory but the literature concerning the role of these receptors in hippocampus in cognition remains controversial. In the present study a 5HT(2A/2C) antagonist ritanserin (0, 2, 4, 8 microg/0.5 microl) and a 5HT(3) antagonist granisetron (0.0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.5 microg/0.5 microl) were injected bilaterally into the CA1 region of rat hippocampus, 20 min before each training session in Morris Water Maze (MWM) task. Compare with control group, ritanserin (4 microg/0.5 microl) significantly reduced the escape latency and traveled distance of swimming to platform, but granisetron (0.25 microg/0.5 microl) significantly increased those parameters. Both drugs had no effect on escape latency and traveled distance of a non-spatial visual discrimination task.

"In the present study, we investigated how different processing stages involved in the perceptual analysis of biological motion (BM) are reflected by modulations in event-related potentials (ERP) in order to elucidate the time course and location of neural processing of BM. Data analysis was carried out using conventional averaging techniques as well as source localization with low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). ERPs were recorded in response to point-light displays of a walking person, an inverted walking person and displays of scrambled motion. Analysis yielded a pronounced negativity with a peak at 180 ms after stimulus onset which was more pronounced for upright walkers than for inverted walkers and scrambled motion. A later negative component between 230 and 360 ms after stimulus onset had a larger amplitude for upright and inverted walkers as compared to scrambled walkers. In the later component, negativity was more pronounced in the right hemisphere revealing asymmetries in BM perception. LORETA analysis yielded evidence for sources specific to BM within the right fusiform gyrus and the right superior temporal gyrus for the second component, whereas sources for BM in the early component were located in areas associated with attentional aspects of visual processing. The early component might reflect the pop-out effect of a moving dot pattern representing the highly familiar form of a human figure, whereas the later component might be associated with the specific analysis of motion patterns providing biologically relevant information.","In the present study, we investigated how different processing stages involved in the perceptual analysis of biological motion (BM) are reflected by modulations in event-related potentials (ERP) in order to elucidate the time course and location of neural processing of BM.","Data analysis was carried out using conventional averaging techniques as well as source localization with low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA).

"Our previous work demonstrates enduring effects of the early life stress of neonatal isolation (ISO). ISO facilitates appetitive response learning in adult female, but not male rats, and enhances corticosterone levels and stress responsivity in infant and juvenile rats of both sexes. Corticosterone acts at brain areas such as hippocampus that are rich in glucocorticoid receptors, differentiate postnatally, are sexually dimorphic, and involved in learning. Thus, ISO is hypothesized to alter aversive learning in adult rats in a sex-specific manner. This study tests this hypothesis using context and cue fear conditioning. Pups were isolated for 1h a day on postnatal (PN) days 2-9 or were non-handled and were then tested in adulthood (PN70-90). In Experiment 1, context- and cue-elicited freezing and ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs; 22 kHz range) were measured. Experiments 2-4, respectively, examined three unconditioned foot shock responses (flinch, jump, vocalization), unconditioned fear (time in center of an open, novel arena), and appetitive (stroking-induced; 50 kHz range) USVs. ISO had a sex-selective effect on context-induced USVs that may reflect changes in foot shock sensitivity. ISO increases foot shock sensitivity and tends to enhance context-induced fear in female rats, whereas ISO tends to impair context-induced fear in male rats. Overall, male rats show greater conditioned fear, and female rats show greater unconditioned fear as well as enhanced responses to the aversive and appetitive stimuli. The sex-specific effect of ISO on context fear may reflect neuronal reorganization in stress responsive areas and/or sex differences in some unconditioned responses.","Our previous work demonstrates enduring effects of the early life stress of neonatal isolation (ISO).

"The cytosolic brain-type creatine kinase (BCK) isoform and the mitochondrial ubiquitous creatine kinase (UbCKmit) isoform are both important for the maintenance and distribution of cellular energy in neurons and astrocytes. Previously, we reported that mice deficient for BCK or UbCKmit each showed a surprisingly mild phenotype, probably due to reciprocal functional compensation by the remaining creatine kinase. This study shows that adult male mice lacking both creatine kinase isoforms (CK--/-- double knockout mice) have a reduced body weight, and demonstrate a severely impaired spatial learning in both a dry and a wet maze, lower nestbuilding activity and diminished acoustic startle reflex responses when compared to age-matched male wildtype mice with the same genetic background. In contrast, their visual and motor functions, exploration behaviour, prepulse inhibition and anxiety-related responses were not changed, suggesting no global deficit in sensorimotor function, hearing or motivation. Morphological analysis of CK--/-- double knockout brains revealed a reduction of approximately 7% in wet brain weight and hippocampal size, a approximately 15% smaller regio-inferior and relatively larger supra-pyramidal, and intra-infra-pyramidal mossy fiber areas. These results suggest that lack of both brain specific creatine kinase isoforms renders the synaptic circuitry in adult brain less efficient in coping with sensory or cognitive activity related challenges.","The cytosolic brain-type creatine kinase (BCK) isoform and the mitochondrial ubiquitous creatine kinase (UbCKmit) isoform are both important for the maintenance and distribution of cellular energy in neurons and astrocytes.

"Rodent chronically injected with D-galactose (D-gal) has been used as an animal aging model for brain aging or anti-aging pharmacology research. However, the dosage of D-gal used to establish this model in mice has been reported in a wide range. To study the dose-dependent effect of D-gal on rodent behaviour, we investigated the learning and memory ability of C57BL/6J (C57) mice after 8-week subcutaneous injection of D-gal at different doses by Morris water maze (MWM) and object recognition test (ORT). In addition, locomotor activity test (LAT) was also performed to examine the neuromuscular function. In comparison of vehicle (0.9% saline)-treated mice, D-gal-treated mice at dose of high (200 mg/kg per day) and middle (100 mg/kg per day) doses showed significant longer latency to platform and less target quadrant search time and distance in MWM In ORT, D-gal at high and middle doses reduced the discrimination index (DI) of mice more significantly than low dose (50 mg/kg per day), although all three doses of D-gal reduced the DI of mice significantly. Furthermore, D-gal at high and middle doses significantly decreased locomotor activity of the mice in LAT. Throughout three tests, D-gal induced behavioural impairments in C57 mice at high and middle doses tended to be in the same degree. These results indicate that d-gal can induce the behavioural impairment of C57 mice in a dose-dependent manner from 50 to 100 mg/kg, higher dose than 100 mg/kg cannot further deteriorate its behavioural performance.","Rodent chronically injected with D-galactose (D-gal) has been used as an animal aging model for brain aging or anti-aging pharmacology research.

"Effects of autoshaping procedures (Paired versus Random) and sipper fluid [chlordiazepoxide (CDP) versus water] on sipper-directed drinking were evaluated in 32 male Long-Evans rats maintained with free access to food and water. For the Paired/CDP group (n = 16), autoshaping procedures consisted of the presentation of the CDP sipper conditioned stimulus (CS) followed by the response-independent presentation of the food unconditioned stimulus (US). The concentration of CDP in the sipper CS (0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.25 mg/ml CDP) was increased across sessions. The Paired/Water group (n = 8) received only water in the sipper CS.

"In some captive and free-ranging populations, unmanipulated female Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) routinely court, mount (with pelvic thrusting), compete for, and even prefer, on occasion, certain female sexual partners over certain males. The goal of this study was to determine if the cytoarchitecture of the dorsocentral portion of the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHdc), was male-typical in female Japanese macaques drawn from one such population. The AHdc is located in the medial preoptic anterior hypothalamus (MPO-AH), a region of the brain that is known to regulate sexual behaviour in primates. Despite their potential for male-typical sexual behaviour and sexual partner preference, our female subjects did not possess male-typical AHdc. The AHdc was significantly larger in males than it was in females, a difference that could be attributed to the significantly larger number of neurons in the male AHdc compared to that of the females. The AHdc of female Japanese macaques were no more male-typical in size than those of female rhesus macaques, a closely related sister species in which females rarely exhibit male-typical sexual behaviour.

Strain and substrain differences in context- and tone-dependent fear conditioning of inbred mice. Behav Brain Res 1999;104:1-12), as well as in the expression of alpha-synuclein (Specht CG, Schoepfer R. Deletion of the alpha-synuclein locus in a subpopulation of C57BL/6J inbred mice. BMC Neurosci 2001;2:11). We tested for a causal relationship between the two findings by employing B6N (expressing alpha-synuclein), B6JOla (not expressing alpha-syn) and the third strain C57BL/6JCrl (B6Jax, expressing alpha-syn). We show that alpha-syn does not account for differences in extinction in a fear conditioning task, as its expression did not covary with the decrease of freezing on repeated non-reinforced tone and context exposure in the three strains: B6Jax exhibited fastest extinction followed by B6JOla. In contrast, B6N showed persistent fear over the course of extinction training. The differences in extinction between B6JOla and B6N were unrelated to sensorimotor processing (pain threshold and basal tone reaction) and innate fear (light-dark test). However, B6Jax displayed less innate fear than B6JOla and B6N. Our results of marked differences in innate and conditioned fear in three B6 substrains illustrate the necessity of a strict adherence to an exact mouse strain nomenclature.","C57BL/6 mice are commonly used as background strains for genetically modified mice, and little attention is usually paid to the notification of the specific substrain.

"This study describes the effect of simulated microgravity in rat on kinematics and electromyographic activity during treadmill locomotion. The analysis was performed in rats submitted to 14 days of hindlimb unloading (HU), in rats submitted to hindlimb unloading and then authorized to recover for 7 days (REC), and in aged-matched control rats (CON). Movements of the right hindlimb were measured with a 3D-optical analyzer (SAGA3 system) and five small infrared-reflective disks positioned on the skin, recorded by three CCD cameras. Results showed that HU rats exhibited hyperextensions at the end of the stance phase. By contrast, during the major part of the step, the ankle was less extended than CON. Possible origins of the changes are discussed. This leads to the question of how important is sensory input in the regulation of the locomotor pattern after HU. Data obtained in REC animals showed that 1 week of recovery allowed the restoration of a good locomotor performance. However, the limb motion remained abnormal, and at contrary to HU rats: higher extension during the step, except at push-off when the limb was in hyperflexion. We concluded that simulated microgravity involves a dual adaptive process: a first one during unloading, and a second one during the period of recovery, which is not a simple return to initial characteristics of the locomotor pattern.",This study describes the effect of simulated microgravity in rat on kinematics and electromyographic activity during treadmill locomotion.,"The analysis was performed in rats submitted to 14 days of hindlimb unloading (HU), in rats submitted to hindlimb unloading and then authorized to recover for 7 days (REC), and in aged-matched control rats (CON).

"The medial septal nucleus regulates the physiology and emergent functions (e.g., memory formation) of the hippocampal formation. This nucleus is particularly rich in cholinergic receptors and is a putative target for the development of cholinomimetic cognitive enhancing drugs. Several studies have examined the direct effects of intraseptal cholinomimetic treatments and the results have been somewhat conflicting with both promnestic and amnestic effects. Several variables (e.g., age, task difficulty, timing of drug administration) may influence treatment outcome. The present study examined the effects of intraseptal infusion of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor tacrine (0-25 microg/0.5 microl) on spatial memory performance. Tacrine was infused into the medial septum just prior to testing. Tacrine infusions did not significantly affect the number of correct choices in the first eight entries, or the number of correct choices until an error. This treatment did not alter the angle of arm entries, or impair the animals' ability to complete the task (enter all baited arms). However, tacrine produced a linear dose-dependent increase in errors, doubling (12.5 microg) and tripling (25.0 microg) the number of errors made before rats completed the task. The deficit demonstrates that activation of intraseptal cholinergic receptors can disrupt spatial memory performance. These findings are discussed with regards to septohippocampal-dependent memory processes and the development of therapeutic strategies in the treatment of age-related memory disorders.","The medial septal nucleus regulates the physiology and emergent functions (e.g., memory formation) of the hippocampal formation.

"The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is a potential rodent model for the impulsive, inattentive and hyperactive aspects of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Impaired response inhibition and deficits of visual attention are demonstrable phenotypes of SHR (compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats), and alterations of catecholaminergic transmission in the prefrontal cortex are thought to contribute to aspects of the phenotypic differences. Here, we investigated the attentional performance of SHR and WKY, using a lateralized reaction time task, a behavioral measure of visuospatial divided attention. SHR acquired the conditional rule of the task normally but exhibited deficient accurate performance when stimulus durations were ultimately decreased to less than 1 s. The alpha-2 agonist guanfacine, which is used clinically to treat symptoms of AD/HD, was without effect on the performance of either SHR or Wistar-Kyoto rats. These data indicate that SHR exhibit performance deficits on a test of visual attention but do not resolve the predictive validity this putative model for AD/HD.","The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is a potential rodent model for the impulsive, inattentive and hyperactive aspects of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

"The effect of 5 min of restraint on the time sexually-receptive females spend in the compartment of a sexually active male was examined. Ovariectomized females, hormonally primed with 10 microg estradiol benzoate and 500 microg progesterone (EP) or primed only with estradiol benzoate (EO) were used. After the restraint or home-cage experience, females were tested for 30 min in a chamber that allowed the female to escape to a small ""burrow"". Females, subjected to restraint, left the male's compartment faster and spent significantly less time in the male's compartment than did non-restrained females. This was true for both EP and EO females. When females were injected with the 5-HT(2B/2C)-receptor antagonist, SB 206553, 15 min before restraint, time spent in the male's compartment was even further reduced. However, additional studies indicated that it was the stress of the injection rather than the action of the drug that was responsible for the female's behavior. These findings are discussed in terms of their significance to the understanding of the female's reproductive response to stress and are compared to prior findings, where lordosis behavior was significantly reduced by restraint.","The effect of 5 min of restraint on the time sexually-receptive females spend in the compartment of a sexually active male was examined.

"Stereotypic behaviors are associated with a broad spectrum of developmental, psychiatric, and genetic disorders. Several lines of evidence indicate that these abnormal repetitive behaviors may be expressed as a consequence of imbalanced activity along the direct and indirect processing pathways of the basal ganglia. Because the activity of these two pathways is modulated, in part, by the neuropeptides dynorphin and enkephalin, we sought to determine whether spontaneous and persistent stereotypy is associated with alterations in striatal neuropeptide content. Specifically, the present study employed radioimmunoassay to measure dynorphin-A and leu-enkephalin content in the dorsolateral striatum of deer mice exhibiting different levels of spontaneous stereotypic jumping. The results indicate significantly decreased leu-enkephalin content and significantly increased dynorphin/enkephalin content ratios in high-stereotypy mice relative to low-stereotypy mice. Moreover, analyses revealed a significant negative correlation between striatal enkephalin content and frequency of stereotypy as well as a significant positive correlation between the dynorphin/enkephalin content ratio and frequency of stereotypy in these mice. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that spontaneous stereotypic behavior is expressed as a consequence of relative hyperactivity along cortico-basal ganglia-cortical feedback circuits involving the direct (facilitative) pathway, but suggest that primary perturbations to the indirect (inhibitory) pathway give rise to such imbalanced activity.","Stereotypic behaviors are associated with a broad spectrum of developmental, psychiatric, and genetic disorders.

"This study examined the correlation between covert attention and basal temperature change during menstrual cycle phase in 22 adult females. Previous work showing beneficial effects of estrogen on working memory led us to hypothesize that attentional function would be facilitated at the apparent time of ovulation. Menstrual phase was determined through questionnaires and objective measurements of basal body temperature (BBT) spikes over a 1 month period. The cued target detection (CTD) task was used to assess visuospatial attentional performance at three times during the menstrual cycle. The mean reaction times (RTs) to visual targets were measured as a function of menstrual cycle phase, cue type and target location. As predicted, the onset of ovulation showed decreased reaction times and a significant increase in the cue validity effect on the days immediately preceding and following ovulation. The magnitude of the attention validity effect was negatively correlated with the basal temperature rise. Women lacking basal temperature shifts failed to show these changes. Results support the conclusion that the natural fluctuations of body temperature, and possibly reproductive hormones, during the menstrual cycle may enhance the attentional component of cognitive performance.",Previous work showing beneficial effects of estrogen on working memory led us to hypothesize that attentional function would be facilitated at the apparent time of ovulation.,"This study examined the correlation between covert attention and basal temperature change during menstrual cycle phase in 22 adult females.

"Changes in sleep-wakefulness (S-W) were studied in adult male Wistar rats, along with body temperature (T(b)), locomotor activity (LMA) and thermal preference, after the lesion of the medial preoptic area (mPOA) with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA). The sleep was decreased after the lesion of the mPOA, but there was recovery when the rats were given freedom to stay in an ambient temperature (T(amb)) which they preferred. When given a choice between three T(amb) (24, 27 and 30 degrees C), the rats preferred 27 degrees C before the mPOA lesion, and 24 degrees C during the initial days after the lesion. There was a shift in the thermal preference to 30 degrees C, on the fourth week after the lesion, which coincided with the considerable recovery of sleep. The preference for higher T(amb) probably helped to improve sleep, as T(amb) of 30 degrees C is known to promote sleep. When the lesioned rats were not given the freedom to select the T(amb), there was no recovery in sleep. The mPOA seems to be essential for increasing the durations of slow wave sleep (SWS) episodes, especially the light SWS (S1), as they remained shorter than the pre-lesion value, even when the rats were given freedom to stay in a preferred T(amb). The homeostatic recovery of sleep, especially the night time sleep, resulted in the disruption of circadian sleep rhythm. But, the LMA, T(b) and thermal preference maintained their diurnal variation. T(b) and LMA were elevated after the mPOA lesion and they remained so till the end of the study.","Changes in sleep-wakefulness (S-W) were studied in adult male Wistar rats, along with body temperature (T(b)), locomotor activity (LMA) and thermal preference, after the lesion of the medial preoptic area (mPOA) with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA).","The sleep was decreased after the lesion of the mPOA, but there was recovery when the rats were given freedom to stay in an ambient temperature (T(amb)) which they preferred.","When given a choice between three T(amb) (24, 27 and 30 degrees C), the rats preferred 27 degrees C before the mPOA lesion, and 24 degrees C during the initial days after the lesion.

"Focal ischemia induces long-term pathophysiological consequences in widespread brain areas. Here we analyzed long-term effects of sequential cortical lesions on brain volume and cognitive function. Rats received either single photothrombotic lesions in the forelimb sensorimotor cortex (SL) or two lesions in sequence either immediately (DL0), 2 days (DL2), 7 days (DL7), or 10 days (DL10) after the first surgery in the homotopic contralateral area. Infarct and global brain volume were measured 7 days (SL and DL2 groups) and one month (all groups) after the last period of ischemia. In the weeks following a stroke, the single lesion shrank considerably. This shrinkage was accentuated by a further lesion received either earlier or later. Thirty-one days after obtaining the second lesion, the lesion scars on both sides had a mean volume of 5.8 +/- 2.3 mm3 in DL2 as compared to 8.5 +/- 3.5 mm3 in SL-animals. In addition, there was a super-additive loss of residual brain volume by 2.2-8.0% in each hemisphere in animals with sequential lesions. In the watermaze, this loss of brain volume corresponded to a slight but significant impairment in performance. The present study revealed a complex interaction of lesions in animals with sequential strokes associated with global reduction of brain volume and cognitive impairment indicating degenerative processes beyond the lesions itself.",Focal ischemia induces long-term pathophysiological consequences in widespread brain areas.

"Several experiments explored the roles of nucleus accumbens (NA), ventral pallidum (VP) and medial preoptic area (MPOA) in the regulation of maternal behavior in rats. A preliminary experiment found that bilateral radiofrequency lesions of medial NA did not disrupt maternal behavior. Experiment 1 found that bilateral infusions of muscimol into VP, but not into medial NA, reversibly disrupted maternal behavior. Experiment 2 found that unilateral muscimol injections into VP disrupted maternal behavior to a greater extent when paired with a contralateral N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) MPOA lesion than when paired with a sham MPOA lesion. Experiment 3 showed that a unilateral NMDA MPOA lesion paired with a contralateral NMDA VP lesion (Contra group) disrupted maternal behavior to a much greater extent than did sham NMLA lesions or NMDA lesions of MPOA and VP ipsilateral to one another. Experiment 3 focused on the specificity of the maternal behavior disruptions and found that the primary maternal deficit in the Contra females was a severe deficit in retrieval behavior. Importantly, these females showed normal hoarding behavior, home cage activity, and elevated plus maze activity. Experiment 3 used Neu N immunohistochemistry to define the extent of MPOA and VP excitotoxic lesions. It is hypothesized that MPOA acts to facilitate the active components of maternal behavior by inhibiting NA, which then releases VP from GABAergic inhibition, and such disinhibition of VP allows pup stimuli to trigger appropriate maternal responses.","Several experiments explored the roles of nucleus accumbens (NA), ventral pallidum (VP) and medial preoptic area (MPOA) in the regulation of maternal behavior in rats.

"Interactions between dopamine (DA) and glutamate (GLU) in the mesocorticolimbic pathway of the brain may influence motivation and reward. Previous work from this laboratory has demonstrated that alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)/kainate receptor blockade may potentiate decreases in exploratory motor activity induced by the DA D(2/3) receptor agonist 7-OH-DPAT in the nucleus accumbens septi (NAS). This study investigated the interaction of AMPA/kainate receptor antagonists CNQX or NBQX with 7-OH-DPAT on ventral tegmental area (VTA) brain stimulation reward (BSR). Effects of these compounds, alone and combined, were measured in male Sprague-Dawley rats stereotaxically implanted with a unilateral VTA electrode and bilateral guide cannulae in the NAS core or shell subregions. Rate-frequency analysis was used to assess BSR frequency thresholds and maximum response rates of rats trained to lever-press for reinforcing electrical stimulation. When given alone, CNQX (0.5 microg), NBQX (0.5 microg), or 7-OH-DPAT (5.0 microg) did not affect BSR frequency thresholds. Co-administration of CNQX or NBQX with 7-OH-DPAT synergistically increased BSR frequency thresholds, indicative of decreased reward. These data indicate that simultaneous AMPA/kainate receptor blockade and DA D(2/3) receptor stimulation in the NAS may act synergistically to inhibit motivated behaviours such as electrical brain self-stimulation.",Interactions between dopamine (DA) and glutamate (GLU) in the mesocorticolimbic pathway of the brain may influence motivation and reward.

Effects of these compounds, alone and combined, were measured in male Sprague-Dawley rats stereotaxically implanted with a unilateral VTA electrode and bilateral guide cannulae in the NAS core or shell subregions. Rate-frequency analysis was used to assess BSR frequency thresholds and maximum response rates of rats trained to lever-press for reinforcing electrical stimulation.","When given alone, CNQX (0.5 microg), NBQX (0.5 microg), or 7-OH-DPAT (5.0 microg) did not affect BSR frequency thresholds. Co-administration of CNQX or NBQX with 7-OH-DPAT synergistically increased BSR frequency thresholds, indicative of decreased reward. These data indicate that simultaneous AMPA/kainate receptor blockade and DA D(2/3) receptor stimulation in the NAS may act synergistically to inhibit motivated behaviours such as electrical brain self-stimulation.",1,1,1,"When given alone, CNQX (0.5 microg), NBQX (0.5 microg), or 7-OH-DPAT (5.0 microg) did not affect BSR frequency thresholds.

"Although amphetamine treatment has been shown to promote recovery of motor function in animals with cortical ablations, the potential therapeutic effect of amphetamine on processes other than motor control, such as attention and working memory, has been relatively unexplored. Accordingly, we investigated the beneficial effect of D-amphetamine treatment in animals with dorsal prefrontal cortex lesions (dPFC) compared with sham controls on a novel combined attention-memory task (CAM) that simultaneously measures attention to a visual stimulus and memory for that stimulus. The dPFC group was impaired in their ability to correctly detect the visual stimulus. Although this deficit occurred together with increased omissions and slow response latencies, these associated deficits largely recovered within the 10 post-operative baseline sessions revealing a selective attentional deficit in this group of animals. Nonetheless, the dPFC lesion did not substantially affect the working memory component of the task. The systemic administration of d-amphetamine served to ameliorate the attentional deficit in the dPFC group at the low dose only (0.2 mg/kg). By contrast, the dPFC group were less sensitive to the detrimental effects of the high dose (0.8 mg/kg) on any aspect of task performance. However, despite improving attention to the visual stimulus, D-amphetamine did not improve memory for that stimulus which instead appeared to deteriorate. The results provide apparently the first demonstration that low doses of D-amphetamine can ameliorate an attentional deficit in animals with selective dPFC lesions and may be a useful model of cognitive deficit in ADHD, schizophrenia or frontal brain injury.","Although amphetamine treatment has been shown to promote recovery of motor function in animals with cortical ablations, the potential therapeutic effect of amphetamine on processes other than motor control, such as attention and working memory, has been relatively unexplored.","Accordingly, we investigated the beneficial effect of D-amphetamine treatment in animals with dorsal prefrontal cortex lesions (dPFC) compared with sham controls on a novel combined attention-memory task (CAM) that simultaneously measures attention to a visual stimulus and memory for that stimulus.

"Behaviour of senescence-accelerated (P/8) and resistant (R/1) mice was assessed using an ethological approach in a longitudinal study for exploratory and anxiety related behaviours (home cage activity, open field, elevated plus-maze and new object tests), cognitive abilities (step-down and step-through passive avoidance and water maze tests) and visual acuity (visible cliff test). Overall, P/8 mice showed higher activity induced by new environmental stimuli, higher anxiety and lower novelty seeking behaviour in the new object test than R/1 mice. P/8 mice showed an impaired performance as compared to R/1 mice in two passive avoidance tasks. Behavioural alterations of P/8 mice were already apparent at the age of 10-12 weeks. Factor analyses indicated that the impairment of P/8 mice in passive avoidance tasks relates to their altered exploratory and anxiety-related behaviour rather than to cognitive impairments. In the water maze, both strains performed badly in the visible platform task, suggesting poor visual abilities in both strains as supported by the visible cliff test. We conclude that, for a better interpretation of cognitive abilities of P/8 mice, tests not based on novelty-induced behaviour, visual acuity and good motor skills should be used. Finally, we question whether P/8 mice could be a model of some forms of neuropsychiatric disorders resulting from developmental abnormalities rather than aging.","Behaviour of senescence-accelerated (P/8) and resistant (R/1) mice was assessed using an ethological approach in a longitudinal study for exploratory and anxiety related behaviours (home cage activity, open field, elevated plus-maze and new object tests), cognitive abilities (step-down and step-through passive avoidance and water maze tests) and visual acuity (visible cliff test).",nan,"Overall, P/8 mice showed higher activity induced by new environmental stimuli, higher anxiety and lower novelty seeking behaviour in the new object test than R/1 mice.

"Spatial learning in the water maze is thought to rely both on distal cues and vestibular information [Aggleton JP, Vann SD, Oswald CJP, Good M.

Experiment 1 demonstrates that while water maze retention relies primarily on cue-platform based associations, this strategy is not precise, as animals tend to focus at the side of the pool. In experiment 2, we demonstrate that vestibular rotation eliminates this inaccuracy. These experiments highlight the importance of both cue and vestibular information for accurate retention of the water maze.","Spatial learning in the water maze is thought to rely both on distal cues and vestibular information [Aggleton JP, Vann SD, Oswald CJP, Good M.

"Restricted feeding schedules (RFS) entrain behavioral and physiological rhythms even in suprachiasmatic nucleus ablated animals, suggesting the existence of a food-entrained oscillator. The nucleus accumbens is an important structure for the expression of motivational behaviors and because its anatomical subterritories, Shell (Acc-Sh) and Core (Acc-Co) establish connections with different functional systems, they may participate in a differential way in food-entrainment. A first experiment, explored the role of Acc-Sh and Acc-Co in food-entrainment using the immunohistochemical detection of the protein c-Fos as a transcriptional activation marker. Experiment 2 tested the differential effect of Acc-Sh and Acc-Co, NMDA excitotoxic lesions. Lesioned rats were entrained to RFS and locomotor activity and free fatty acids (FFA) concentrations were evaluated. Results data show that in the Acc-Sh there is an increase of c-Fos immunoreactivity in food-entrained rats principally during feeding, whereas c-Fos expression in the Acc-Co region was increased during feeding and also anticipating mealtime. FFA were entrained in both lesioned groups, but the basal level was lower in Core-lesion rats. All rats exhibited food anticipatory activity (FAA). However, FAA was increased in Shell-lesioned animals and was almost abolished in the Core-lesion rats. These data indicate that the accumbens nucleus is involved with behavioral and metabolic food-entrainment, and that there is a differential role between both subregions.","Restricted feeding schedules (RFS) entrain behavioral and physiological rhythms even in suprachiasmatic nucleus ablated animals, suggesting the existence of a food-entrained oscillator.

"Behavioural abnormalities in adulthood may have their origin in a disturbed interaction with the environment during postnatal development. We tested the consequences for adult social motivation of early deprivation (ED) of rat pups from mothers and littermates relative to nonhandled (NH) pups. Early deprivation was performed at room or warm ambient temperatures, cold-ED and warm-ED, respectively, and during either the dark or light phase of the daily cycle. In adulthood, rats that were unrelated and unfamiliar but of the same treatment group were introduced in pairs to an open field for a 30-min test. Social behaviour in home base and exploration modes was assessed using algorithmic analysis of the XY locations of the two rats. Findings revealed that Cold-ED induced a preference for a separate home base, which limited significantly the episodes of social interactions, in comparison to NH. Warm-ED had no comparable effect on the rats' social behaviour. These findings indicate that ED under ambient conditions that constitute severe thermal stress for rat pups leads to development of reduced social motivation in adulthood.",Behavioural abnormalities in adulthood may have their origin in a disturbed interaction with the environment during postnatal development.,"We tested the consequences for adult social motivation of early deprivation (ED) of rat pups from mothers and littermates relative to nonhandled (NH) pups.

"Current evidence suggests that ginsenosides inhibit methamphetamine (MA)-induced changes in behavior, but the precise mechanisms that underlie this effect are yet to be determined. We examined the role of adenosine receptors in the ginsenoside-induced changes in hyperlocomotion and conditioned place preference (CPP) in mice that occurred in response to administration of MA (2 mg/kg, i.p. x 1 or 2 mg/kg, i.p. x 6). Changes in circling behavior paralleled changes in CPP in the presence of MA. Pre-treatment with ginsenosides (50 or 150 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated the MA-induced circling behavior and CPP. This attenuation was reversed by the adenosine A2A receptor antagonist 1,3,7-trimethyl-8-(3-chrostyryl)xanthine (CSC; 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) in a dose-dependent manner, but neither the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine (CPT; 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) nor the A2B receptor antagonist alloxazine (ALX; 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg) had any such effect. MA-induced increases in activator protein (AP)-1 DNA binding activity, Fos-related antigen immunoreactivity (FRA-IR), proenkephalin mRNA expression, and proenkephalin-like immunoreactivity were reduced consistently in the striatum of animals that were pretreated with ginsenosides. These reductions were largely prevented by CSC, but not by CPT or ALX. Our results suggest that the stimulation of A2A receptors by ginsenosides attenuates the changes in behavior and the increases in AP-1 DNA binding activity, FRA-IR, and proenkephalin gene expression in mouse striatum that are induced by MA.","Current evidence suggests that ginsenosides inhibit methamphetamine (MA)-induced changes in behavior, but the precise mechanisms that underlie this effect are yet to be determined.","We examined the role of adenosine receptors in the ginsenoside-induced changes in hyperlocomotion and conditioned place preference (CPP) in mice that occurred in response to administration of MA (2 mg/kg, i.p. x 1 or 2 mg/kg, i.p. x 6).

"Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type IIIA or Sanfilippo syndrome is a lysosomal storage disorder characterised by progressive neurological pathology. Patients exhibit aggression, disturbed sleep, hyperactivity and mental decline ultimately resulting in inanition and death. Recently, a mouse model of MPS-IIIA was discovered, and both the clinical signs and neuropathological changes mimic the human disease. This provides us with an opportunity to study the pathological progression of this disorder and to determine the efficacy of novel therapies, for at present all lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) affecting the brain are untreatable. Neuropathological changes have previously been described in areas of the brain involved in regulating motor function, therefore, in the present study we sought to determine whether quantifiable motor abnormalities were present in the MPS-IIIA mouse, and if so, at what age they became detectable. Tests of open-field locomotor activity, hindlimb gait, catalepsy, neuromuscular strength and negative geotaxis were administered to MPS-IIIA and normal male and female mice aged from 3 to 40 weeks of age. Significant changes in open-field activity were observed from 3 weeks in MPS-IIIA mice, whereas abnormalities in tests of gait, grip strength and in the assessment of the negative geotaxis response were observable from approximately 15 weeks of age. Behavioural changes were often detected in male MPS-IIIA mice before they appeared in females. Our observations provide insight into the chronology of pathological changes within the MPS-IIIA brain and this simple series of tests will prove useful in comparing mice following the administration of experimental therapies for this condition.","Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type IIIA or Sanfilippo syndrome is a lysosomal storage disorder characterised by progressive neurological pathology.

"It has been speculated that an individual's response to novelty is a reliable predictor of its vulnerability to develop addiction. However, the relationships between response to novelty and the development of drug-induced conditioned place preference are still unclear. The present study investigates the relationships between locomotor responses to novelty, cocaine-induced locomotor stimulation and conditioned place preference in C57BL/6J mice with multiple regression analyses. Four groups of mice receiving saline, 4, 8 or 12 mg/kg cocaine (i.p.) were submitted to an 8-day unbiased counterbalanced place conditioning protocol.

Cocaine-induced dose-dependent locomotor stimulant effects and a significant place preference at all tested doses. A positive correlation was found between the locomotor responses to novelty and the locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine, but was significant only for the highest dose of cocaine (12 mg/kg).

Finally, the locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine do not correlate with cocaine-induced conditioned place preference at any tested dose of cocaine.

"Violent behaviour has a strong association with antisocial personality disorder (APD) and schizophrenia. Although developments in the understanding of socio-environmental factors associated with violence should not be ignored, advances in prevention and treatment of violent behaviour would benefit by improved understanding of its neurobiological and cognitive basis. The authors, therefore, investigated prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response in APD and schizophrenia in relation to a history of serious violence. The neural substrates of PPI, especially the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and basal ganglia, are implicated in violence as well as in APD and schizophrenia. The study included four groups: (i) patients with APD and a history of violence, (ii) patients with schizophrenia and a history of violence, (iii) patients with schizophrenia without a history of violence, and (iv) healthy subjects with no history of violence or a mental disorder. All subjects were assessed identically on acoustic PPI. Compared to healthy subjects, significantly reduced PPI occurred in APD, violent schizophrenia and non-violent schizophrenia patients. Although PPI did not significantly differentiate the three clinical groups, high ratings of violence were modestly associated with reduced PPI across the entire study sample. Violent patients with impulsive and premeditated violence showed comparable PPI. The association between violent behaviour and impaired PPI suggests that neural structures and functions underlying PPI are implicated in (inhibition of) violence.","Violent behaviour has a strong association with antisocial personality disorder (APD) and schizophrenia.

"Men are hypothesised to perform better than women at tasks requiring cognitive inhibition. The present study applied whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural correlates of cognitive inhibition using a novel task, requiring detection of numbers decreasing in numerical order, in relation to sex. The study involved 19 young healthy subjects (9 men, 10 women). Behavioural sex differences favouring men were found on the inhibition, but not on the automatization (i.e. detection of numbers increasing in numerical order), condition of the task. Significant areas of activation associated with cognitive inhibition included the right inferior prefrontal and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, left inferior and superior parietal lobes, and bilateral temporal regions across men and women. No brain region was significantly differently activated in men and women. Our findings demonstrate that (a) cognitive inhibition is dependent on intact processes within frontal and parietal regions, and (b) women show inferior cognitive inhibition despite of comparable activation to men in relevant regions.

"In the present study, we investigate the effect of aggressive behavior and release of nerve growth factor (NGF) on brain progenitor cells. We found that the condition of subordination enhances the level of NGF in the subventricular zone and hippocampus whereas dominance elevates brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). It was also found that mRNA-TrkA is over-expressed in the subventricular zone and hippocampus of dominant and subordinate mice, whereas mRNA-TrkB is increased in the subventricular zone of both dominants and subordinates and in the hippocampus of dominant mice. Fighting was also associated with increased presence of proliferating cells in the hippocampus stained with the nuclear marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Moreover, the brain of subordinate mice displayed tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in the wall of the periventricular region of the third ventricles and a marked neuropeptide Y (NPY) presence in the hippocampus co-expressed with BrdU. These results provide additional evidence that agonistic behavior in the aged mouse alters neurotrophin levels and increases brain progenitor cells number. The functional significance of these findings is discussed.","In the present study, we investigate the effect of aggressive behavior and release of nerve growth factor (NGF) on brain progenitor cells.","We found that the condition of subordination enhances the level of NGF in the subventricular zone and hippocampus whereas dominance elevates brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).

Moreover, the brain of subordinate mice displayed tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in the wall of the periventricular region of the third ventricles and a marked neuropeptide Y (NPY) presence in the hippocampus co-expressed with BrdU.",These results provide additional evidence that agonistic behavior in the aged mouse alters neurotrophin levels and increases brain progenitor cells number. The functional significance of these findings is discussed.,1,1,1,These results provide additional evidence that agonistic behavior in the aged mouse alters neurotrophin levels and decreases brain progenitor cells number.

"Psychotropic drugs are commonly used in the elderly, including those who may sustain ischemic attacks. Concomitant CNS medication may interfere with functional recovery. The present study evaluated the effect of risperidone, an atypical neuroleptic, and fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on histological and functional outcome after experimental stroke in aged rats, which might be more vulnerable to brain insults. Aged Wistar rats were treated with risperidone at a dose of 1 mg/kg (i.p., once a day), fluoxetine at a dose of 5 mg/kg (i.p., once a day), or their combination. Drug treatment was started 7 days before focal cortical photothrombosis (Rose Bengal, 20 mg/kg) and continued for 28 days thereafter. Sensorimotor recovery was assessed by a new beam-walking test and spatial learning by the Morris water-maze before cortical stroke, immediately after stroke, and at the end of follow-up. Infarct volumes were measured from nitroblue tetrazolium-stained sections at the end of follow-up. The high slip ratio for the contralateral hindlimb in ischemic rats treated with risperidone indicated sensorimotor impairment when tested 2 h after drug administration. Sensorimotor impairment was not observed, however, when the rats were tested 24 h after risperidone administration. Similarly, water-maze performance was impaired 2 h after risperidone. Fluoxetine did not affect sensorimotor or water-maze performance. Cortical infarct volumes were not different in ischemic controls and ischemic rats treated with antipsychotic drugs. The present study showed that an atypical neuroleptic, risperidone, acutely impairs behavioral performance, but does not affect histological or functional outcome in aged rats subjected to cortical photothrombosis.","Psychotropic drugs are commonly used in the elderly, including those who may sustain ischemic attacks.

"It is well known that Parkinson's disease occurs more commonly in older people and men are more frequently affected than women. Animal studies in models of the disease mainly use young male animals. The effects of aging on the neurochemical changes in the dopaminergic system have been extensively studied, however, data on comparative behavioral consequences of lesions of the dopaminergic system in aging and in female animals are limited. The aim of the present study was to give a detailed comparative behavioral analysis of young and aging male and female rats following 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion of the substantia nigra. Young males and females, as well as aging males and females underwent 6-OHDA-induced lesion of the substantia nigra. Behavioral analysis in an open-field was performed before the injury, and 1 and 10 days after the operation. Tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry was done in order to assess the dopaminergic cell loss in the substantia nigra. It was found that both young and aging male animals were more susceptible to 6-OHDA than females: female rats had a significantly less dopaminergic cell loss and responded to 6-OHDA with a significantly higher degree of behavioral recovery after the injury. Although the dopaminergic cell loss was not significantly different between young and aging animals of the same sex, aging rats showed more severe behavioral deficits. In summary, our present results showed clear age- and gender differences in the behavioral and histological outcome following 6-OHDA lesion of the substantia nigra.","It is well known that Parkinson's disease occurs more commonly in older people and men are more frequently affected than women.

"We assess relative time courses of motor development in ferrets and rats and evaluate ferrets as experimental animals for studies of motor development. Motor behaviour of ferret pups was characterized in daily sessions from postnatal day (P) 2 to P63. Observations concerning rotational locomotion ('pivoting'), crawling, walking, upright standing ('rearing') and walking on a narrow path; righting on a surface, in mid-air and on an inclined plane ('geotaxis') were quantified in detail and compared with published data on rat motor development. Besides providing a comprehensive characterization of ferret motor development, our results demonstrate that relative time courses of emergence of motor skills in ferrets and rats are highly similar despite substantially different duration of postnatal periods. The relationship between species was determined by linear regression analysis of an x-y-plot of postnatal ages (y: ferret days; x: rat days) corresponding to given levels of performance of specific skills. The model equation y = 2.46x-4.18 represents the conversion between time courses of rat and ferret motor development. Remarkably, the model explained 81% of data variance (r2 = 0.81) and should hence be useful for translation of motor developmental data between ferret and rat and for comparisons between motor and other functions in ferrets. The highly conserved relative time course also has more general implications for the understanding of comparative aspects of development. In addition, the high reproducibility of data within the present study underscores the suitability of the ferret as an experimental animal for studies of motor development.",We assess relative time courses of motor development in ferrets and rats and evaluate ferrets as experimental animals for studies of motor development.,"Motor behaviour of ferret pups was characterized in daily sessions from postnatal day (P) 2 to P63.

"Forced swimming test (FST) or 'behavioural despair' test is a useful screening for antidepressant drugs. The FST predictability has been improved by a number of procedural modifications. Description of the behavioural microstructure in FST may help to delineate innovative protocols. Thus, counts of all behaviours emitted during FST in rats (four-month-old Wistar male, n = 63) were recorded and examined by Markovian sequential analysis (MSA) and principal components analysis (PCA). In a second experiment, rats (n = 28) were tested in an open field test (OFT) followed a week later by FST; behaviours in both tests were recorded and analysed by two correlation methods (Pearson's test and sliding window correlation). The descriptive ethological analysis displayed counts of swimming and immobility increased over the course of the test, whereas climbing behaviour decreased. The MSA revealed the occurrence of immobility was predicted by swimming, climbing, and diving behaviours whereas the immobility predicted the occurrence of swimming behaviour and headshakes. The PCA showed duration of immobility and climbing loaded into one component and duration of immobility and swimming loaded into another one. Low as well high levels of climbing behaviour were positively correlated with motor activity in the OFT. In brief, the present data suggest there are at least two different factors that grouped variables related to the behavioural despair in the FST. In addition, altered motor activity could be predicted by the frequency of climbing behaviour recorded in the FST.",Forced swimming test (FST) or 'behavioural despair' test is a useful screening for antidepressant drugs.

"It was previously demonstrated that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling plays a pivotal role in neural plasticity and memory processes both in rodents and mollusks. Although the MAPK pathways are highly conserved, no evidence was found for its participation in memory models in other animal groups. Here we found ERK-like and JNK-like cross-immunoreactivity in the crab brain with phospho-specific antibodies and we estimated ERK and JNK activity during long-term memory consolidation in the context-signal learning paradigm of the crab Chasmagnathus. At 0, 1, 3 and 6h after training ERK and JNK activity was measured. ERK-like activation was found 1h after spaced training in cytosolic but not in nuclear fractions of brain homogenates, while JNK activity remained unchanged in both fractions. Passive (context exposure) and active (continuous stimulation) controls showed cytosolic ERK and JNK activation immediately after training, which decayed 1h later. In coincidence with this time course of activity, an ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor, PD098059, induced amnesia only when administered 45 min after training but not when administered immediately pre- or post-training. These data support that: (1) cytoplasmic but not nuclear ERK substrates must be differentially phosphorylated during memory consolidation, and (2) ERK phosphorylation and consequent activation 1h after training is necessary for long-term memory consolidation in this arthropod model.","It was previously demonstrated that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling plays a pivotal role in neural plasticity and memory processes both in rodents and mollusks.

"The cholinergic pathways are intimately involved in the learning and memory process and disruption of this system produces impairments in many learning and memory models. Converging lines of evidence support the idea that there is an age-related decline in learning and memory in animals and this decline is strikingly similar to memory changes that occur when the cholinergic system is compromised. The purpose of this work was to evaluate whether a single administration of the muscarinic receptor agonist Pilocarpine (Pilo) could prevent the age-related learning impairment in rats. Three groups of animals received Pilo (300 mg/kg, i.p.), at 3 months of age, and the animals that did not show Status epilepticus were submitted to the water maze task 1 or 21 months after or once a month from the 4th to 24th month of age. The results showed that Pilo did not interfere with learning abilities 1-month after treatment nor in animals that were submitted to the test once a month. In addition, the animals treated with Pilo and submitted to the task 21 month after performed as well as control young rats in the training and in the testing sessions, while a marked learning impairment was detected in control old rats. These results indicate that a single administration of Pilo might prevent the age-related learning impairments in rats on a spatial task in the water maze.",The cholinergic pathways are intimately involved in the learning and memory process and disruption of this system produces impairments in many learning and memory models.

"Microtubule associated protein tau is abnormally phosphorylated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aggregates as paired helical filaments (PHFs) in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are one of the pathological signatures of AD and their presence correlates with severity of dementia. Dysfunction of protein phosphatases in the effected neurons is proposed to be a possible causative factor to AD development. We show here that the pattern of tau phosphorylation correlates with the decline of memory retention ability in rat brain. In our study, we have chosen 55 rats of full age to conduct the discrimination between their normal and low ability of memory retention in one-trial step-down test. It was found that among rats that developed the impairment in memory retention in step-down inhibitory avoidance task, tau protein in their hippocampus was hyperphosohorylated at Thr231/Ser235 (M4) sites of tau, and the significantly increased expression of PP-1 and the decreased one of PP-2B were also determined by Western blot and/or immunohistochemistry. It is implicated that: (1) the hyperphosphorylation of tau at M4 sites may be crucial to affect the memory retention of elder rats; (2) PP-1 might participate in the regulation of phosphorylation at Thr231 and Ser235 epitope of tau in vivo, and the up-regulation of PP-1 content could be in relation to tau hyperphosphorylation at Thr231/Ser235 sites of brain tau and the worse memory retention of rats indirectly; and (3) the decline of PP-2B content could induced the hyperphosphorylation of tau at M4 sides in vivo.","Microtubule associated protein tau is abnormally phosphorylated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aggregates as paired helical filaments (PHFs) in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are one of the pathological signatures of AD and their presence correlates with severity of dementia.

"A new apparatus, the olfactory tubing maze for mice, was developed recently to study learning and memory processes in mice in regard to their ethological abilities. As in humans, BALB/c mice with selective bilateral lesions of the hippocampal formation showed selective impairment of subcategories of long-term memory when tested with the olfactory tubing maze. After three learning sessions, control mice reached a high percentage of correct responses. They consistently made the olfactory-reward associations, but antero-dorsal and postero-ventral hippocampal-lesioned mice did not. However, all lesioned mice learned the paradigm and the timing of the task as fast and as well as control mice. These data suggest that the olfactory tubing maze can be used to study subcategories of memory, such as declarative and non-declarative memory, which are similar in some respects to those observed in humans. Consequently, possible memory effects of classical approaches (i.e., pharmacological or lesion studies) or genetic modifications in transgenic or gene-targeting mice can be effectively analyzed using this new apparatus.","A new apparatus, the olfactory tubing maze for mice, was developed recently to study learning and memory processes in mice in regard to their ethological abilities.

"When food is available during a restricted and predictable time of the day, animals show increased locomotor and food searching behaviors before the anticipated daily meal. We had shown that histamine-containing neurons are the only aminergic neurons related to arousal that become active in anticipation of an upcoming meal. To further map, the brain regions involved in the expression of the feeding-anticipatory behavior, we quantified the expression of Fos in hypothalamic areas involved in arousal. We found that nearly 35% of the histamine neurons from the tuberomammillary nucleus were Fos-immunoreactive immediately before mealtime. One hour before this transient increase in Fos-immunoreactivity, we found a similarly brief increase of fos mRNA in the tuberomammillary nucleus. In contrast, the activation of two types of perifornical hypothalamic neurons followed meal onset by 1-2 h. One neuron type was orexin/hypocretin-immunoreactive, while the other type was neither orexin nor melanin concentrating hormone-immunoreactive. The present work indicates that the increased locomotor activity that anticipates mealtime coincides with the activation of the tuberomammillary nucleus, and that the behavioral activation during the consummatory phase of feeding coincides more closely with the delayed activation of the perifornical hypothalamic area.","When food is available during a restricted and predictable time of the day, animals show increased locomotor and food searching behaviors before the anticipated daily meal.

"Recent research on genetically modified mice has attributed the amnesic effect of benzodiazepines mainly to the alpha1-containing GABA(A) receptor subtypes. The pharmacological approach, using subtype selective ligands, is needed to complement genetic studies. We tested the effects of the non-selective antagonist flumazenil (0-20.0 mg/kg), the preferential alpha1-subunit selective antagonist beta-carboline-3-carboxylate-t-butyl ester (beta-CCt) (0-30.0 mg/kg), the non-selective agonist midazolam (0-2.0 mg/kg), the preferential alpha1-subunit selective agonist zolpidem (0-3.0 mg/kg), and the non-selective inverse agonist methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) (0-2.0 mg/kg) in the one-trial step-through passive avoidance task in rats. The compounds were administered intraperitoneally, before the acquisition test. Flumazenil and beta-CCt did not affect retention performance. Midazolam and zolpidem induced amnesia in a dose-dependent manner. The complete reversal of amnesia was unattainable. The effects of zolpidem were significantly attenuated by the both, flumazenil (10.0 mg/kg) and beta-CCt (30.0 mg/kg); by contrast, only flumazenil was considerably effective when combined with midazolam. DMCM exerted promnesic effects at 0.2mg/kg, in an inverted U-shape manner. Both antagonists tended to abolish this action. The results indicate that some other alpha-subunit(s), in addition to the alpha1-subunit, contribute to the amnesic actions of non-selective benzodiazepine site agonists in the passive avoidance task. On the other hand, a significant part of the DMCM-induced promnesic effect could involve the alpha1-subunit and/or other putative beta-CCt-sensitive binding site(s).","Recent research on genetically modified mice has attributed the amnesic effect of benzodiazepines mainly to the alpha1-containing GABA(A) receptor subtypes.

The effects of zolpidem were significantly attenuated by both flumazenil (10.0 mg/kg) and beta-CCt (30.0 mg/kg); by contrast, only beta-CCt was considerably effective when combined with midazolam. DMCM exerted promnesic effects at 0.2mg/kg, in an inverted U-shape manner. Both antagonists tended to abolish this action. The results indicate that some other alpha-subunit(s), in addition to the alpha1-subunit, contribute to the amnesic actions of non-selective benzodiazepine site agonists in the passive avoidance task.

"The present experiment was designed to examine the effects of prenatal stress and gender in latent inhibition. Prenatal stress has been proposed as a risk factor both for depression and for schizophrenia, and both of these syndromes are associated with alterations in the functional state of the dopamine system. There is also some evidence that prenatal stress can produce changes in dopamine activity, although the details of the stress-induced changes are a matter of debate. Latent inhibition (LI), which is strongly dependent on dopaminergic activity, consists in delayed Pavlovian conditioning about a stimulus that previously signalled no consequence. We induced prenatal stress by exposing gestating dams to a daily constraint stress during the last week of pregnancy. We tested the rats for LI of conditioned taste aversion by exposing them to sucrose for 3 days prior to conditioning. Irrespective of stress or gender, latent inhibition was observed but the degree of LI varied as a function of both prenatal stress and gender. Unstressed males showed less LI than unstressed females, but prenatal stress increased the amount of LI only in the males. These results are inconsistent with the use of prenatal stress as an animal model for schizophrenia. A model is proposed that accounts for the relationships between gender, dopamine function, cognitive changes and psychiatric pathology.","The present experiment was designed to examine the effects of prenatal stress and gender in latent inhibition.

"5-HT-moduline is an endogenous tetrapeptide, which acts specifically as an antagonist of 5-HT1B auto- and heteroreceptors. HG1 is an ethyl arylmethyloxypiperidine acetate and an antagonist of 5-HT-moduline, which has no 5-HT-moduline agonist effect. In a pilot study, HG1 has demonstrated an anxiolytic-like profile in three mouse models of anxiety (elevated plus maze, light/dark, four plates). The aim of our study was to examine the mechanism of the anxiolytic-like effects of HG1 in the mouse elevated plus maze. Male Swiss mice were acutely administered HG1 at active doses in association with GABA antagonists such as flumazenil, bicuculline and picrotoxine, then, with 5-HT1A (NAN 190, WAY 100635) and 5-HT1B receptor antagonist (methiothepine). Finally, we tried to potentiate non-active doses of HG1 with 5-HT1A (8-OHDPAT) and 5-HT1B receptor agonists (anpirtoline) in the mouse elevated plus maze. Regarding GABA antagonists, only flumazenil antagonised active doses of HG1 in an incomplete manner. Moreover, non-active doses of HG1 were potentiated by low doses of WAY 100635 and by anpirtoline but not by 8-OHDPAT. Finally, the anxiolytic-like effects of HG1 at active doses were antagonised by all serotonergic antagonists (WAY 100635 at higher dose, NAN 190 and methiothepin). HG1 mechanism of action in the mouse elevated plus maze seems to associate a GABA-ergic component exerting a limited regulation of 5-HT neuronal activity and a major serotonergic component, which seems to implicate presynaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors.","5-HT-moduline is an endogenous tetrapeptide, which acts specifically as an antagonist of 5-HT1B auto- and heteroreceptors.

"Hemispheric lateralization of the neural systems supporting language and spatial attention most commonly dissociate in healthy individuals. However, the reverse pattern with association of language and attention within the right hemispheres has also been observed. We investigated in 75 healthy volunteers (37 right-handed, 38 left-handed) if language and spatial attention may associate not only in individuals with an atypical pattern of language lateralization, but also in subjects showing the standard, i.e. left-hemispheric dominance for language. Hemispheric lateralization of cerebral perfusion was determined with functional transcranial Doppler ultrasonography during a visuospatial attention, and a word generation task. We found that language and visuospatial attention associated within the left hemisphere in five subjects and within the right hemisphere in eight subjects. We conclude that all combinations of cerebral lateralization for language and attention may exist in the healthy brain.","Hemispheric lateralization of the neural systems supporting language and spatial attention most commonly dissociate in healthy individuals.

"In previous studies, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was shown to have a positive effect on memory in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Moreover, the reported effects appeared to be more beneficial in early stages of Alzheimer's disease compared to later stage intervention. Based on this stage-dependency, the present study examined the effects of TENS on memory in a preclinical stage of AD, i.e. in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Our results suggest that TENS did not improve memory in a MCI population. Mechanisms that might underlie the absence of positive effects of the TENS treatment in a MCI population are discussed.","In previous studies, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was shown to have a positive effect on memory in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients.

"Maternal separation (MS) is an animal model of early adverse experience, which is known to affect hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function and various aspects of emotional behaviour. Sexual dysfunction is a prominent symptom in depression and in the present study we investigated the effects of maternal separation on copulatory behaviour and partner preference in adult male rats and paced mating in adult female rats. It has been suggested that corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) inhibits copulatory behaviour in male rats and we therefore examined if changes in male sexual behaviour were accompanied by changes in hypothalamic corticotropin releasing factor protein content. We found changed copulatory behaviour reflected in decreased mount latency, intromission latency, and post-ejaculatory interval in rats subjected to 180 min daily separation compared to handled rats, separated for 15 min daily on postnatal days (PNDs) 2-14. Ejaculation latency was not affected and there were no changes in partner preference in male rats. Paced mating behaviour of adult maternally separated female rats was unaffected. The concentration of corticotropin releasing factor-like immunoreactivity was lower in the hypothalamus of male rats separated for 180 min compared to male handled rats. We therefore suggest that 180 min of maternal separation generates a male phenotype with increased sexual motivation possibly due to inadequate levels of corticotropin releasing factor in the hypothalamus.","Maternal separation (MS) is an animal model of early adverse experience, which is known to affect hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function and various aspects of emotional behaviour.

"Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4), one of the three most common human apoE (h-apoE) isoforms, is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and for cognitive deficits associated with aging. The biological mechanisms involving apoE in learning and memory processes are unclear. A potential isoform-dependent effect of h-apoE on cognitive performance was studied in gene-targeted mice, which show physiological expression levels and distribution of h-apoE3 or h-apoE4. Male and female h-apoE3 and h-apoE4, apoE-deficient and C57BL/6J mice (4-5 months) were subjected to tasks evaluating spatial memory and avoidance conditioning. Female h-apoE4 mice did not detect changes in the spatial configuration of objects as opposed to female h-apoE3 mice. Female h-apoE3 mice failed to improve their performance during training in a reference memory version of the spatial water-maze task, but performed well during the probe trial 24 h after the last training trial. Memory retention performances of h-apoE4 mice were impaired during this probe trial. Both h-apoE3 and h-apoE4 mice did not improve their performance in a water-maze delayed matching to place task. Finally, h-apoE3 mice showed mild perturbations in a Y-maze active avoidance task, whereas both h-apoE mouse lines performed well in a passive avoidance task. Thus, spatial memory performances appeared particularly sensitive to h-apoE-isoform-dependent effects. Deficits occurred predominantly in female h-apoE4 mice, which support the hypothesis that humans carrying h-apoE4, especially women, have impaired spatial memory compared to those carrying h-apoE3.","Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4), one of the three most common human apoE (h-apoE) isoforms, is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and for cognitive deficits associated with aging.

"In the present study, NaSi-1 sulphate transporter knock-out (Nas1-/-) mice, an animal model of hyposulphataemia, were examined for spatial memory and learning in a Morris water maze, and for olfactory function in a cookie test. The Nas1-/- mice displayed significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased latencies to find an escape platform in the reversal learning trials at 2 days but not 1 day after the last acquisition trial in a Morris water maze test, suggesting that Nas1-/- mice may have proactive memory interference. While the wild-type (Nas1+/+) mice showed a significant (P&lt;0.02) decrease in time to locate a hidden food reward over four trials after overnight fasting, Nas1-/- mice did not change their performance, resulting in significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher latencies when compared to their Nas1+/+ littermates. There were no significant differences between Nas1-/- and Nas1+/+ mice in the cookie test after moderate food deprivation. In addition, both Nas1-/- and Nas1+/+ mice displayed similar escape latencies in the acquisition phase of the Morris water maze test, suggesting that learning, motivation, vision and motor skills required for the task may not be affected in Nas1-/- mice.

"Previous studies have suggested that exercise in a running wheel can be neuroprotective, perhaps due to, among others, gene-expression changes after exercise, increases in trophic proteins and/or enhanced cardiovascular responsivity. Here we ask whether physical exercise or environmental enrichment provide protection after brain damage, especially in terms of recovery of cognitive function. To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of these conditions, we used the kainic acid (KA) model of neuronal injury. Systemically-administered KA induces excitotoxicity by overstimulation of glutamate receptors, resulting in neuronal death by necrosis and apoptosis. Our results show that exercise, but not enriched environment, prior to KA-induced brain damage, improved behavioural performance in both Morris watermaze and object exploration tasks. However, prior exercise did not decrease to control levels the hyperactivity normally seen in KA-treated animals, as measured by ambulation in the open field. Furthermore, both exercise and enriched environment did not protect against neuron loss in CA1, CA2 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus, despite a substantial increase in brain-derived neutrophic factor (BDNF) levels in dentate gyrus of the exercise and KA-treated animals.","Previous studies have suggested that exercise in a running wheel can be neuroprotective, perhaps due to, among others, gene-expression changes after exercise, increases in trophic proteins and/or enhanced cardiovascular responsivity.

"The behavior of Tristram's jird (a species of gerbil) in an illuminated open field resembled that of other rodents, comprising round trips to a home base and alternating between periods of progression (locomoting) and of stopping. In this study, we compared the characteristics of exploration in a dark arena with exploration by the same individuals in a lit arena. In the dark arena, stopping episodes were brief and fewer, suggesting almost continuous locomotion by the rodents. The clear distinction between progression and stopping that had characterized locomotion in an illuminated arena, thus diminished in the dark. There was also no apparent home base in the dark and traveling consisted in moving in a circular path, closing a loop to a recently traveled place that varied from one loop to the next. Locomotion in the dark may thus be regarded as a set of loops (round trips) to a continuously shifting home base, whereas with lights on the round trips converge to a home base using visible environmental landmarks. We suggest that a similar looping mechanism may be applicable to the behavior of hippocampal rats displaying hyperactivity and diversified locomotion, reminiscent of that seen in jirds in a dark arena.","The behavior of Tristram's jird (a species of gerbil) in an illuminated open field resembled that of other rodents, comprising round trips to a home base and alternating between periods of progression (locomoting) and of stopping.","In this study, we compared the characteristics of exploration in a dark arena with exploration by the same individuals in a lit arena.","In the dark arena, stopping episodes were brief and fewer, suggesting almost continuous locomotion by the rodents.

"We tested the hypothesis that the ontogenetic development of the corpus callosum (CC) affects the consistency of laterality in a paw preference task. Adult male mice (55 normal and 29 acallosal) of the BALB/cCF strain were initially tested (twice; inter-test interval: 72 h) in an unbiased setup in which both forepaws could easily perform a reaching movement. In a subsequent test, animals were placed in a biased setup that favored the use of the non-preferred paw. Acallosal and normal mice were strongly lateralized in the unbiased setup. Additionally, while normal mice did not present a populational bias favoring one of the paws, acallosal mice presented a significant bias favoring the left paw. In the biased setup, left- and right-pawed normal mice were equally consistent (approximately 65% of the animals, in both groups, used the preferred paw of the initial two tests, in spite of the bias). Conversely, while left-pawed acallosal mice were as consistent (65%) as normal mice, only 20% of right-pawed mice were consistent. These results suggest that the development of the CC affects consistency of laterality in a side-dependent manner.

"Cerebral lateralisation once thought to be confined to humans has been reported for a range of vertebrate species now. We report here biases in visual perceptual processing in a teleost fish. Female guppy fish used the right eye preferentially to view a familiar stimulus. This bias reversed on being presented with a strange female guppy, the left eye being used more to view it. This pattern of viewing is probably associated with the right eye system, which is used to view a stimulus with an intention to approach it. The increase in the left eye use, to view a stranger may be associated with the role of the left eye in comparing the features of a strange conspecific. In the second experiment, lateralisation of viewing visual stimuli that could evoke different levels of motivation to biologically relevant stimuli was tested. It is known that female guppies prefer to approach orange coloured males. Lateralisation of detour response as well as eye use after detour to view a dull or an orange male stimulus was recorded in deprived female fish. There was a bias to detour to the left side; which was more significant for the orange than the dull male. Once the female guppies detoured the cage they preferentially used the left eye to view the male conspecific; this being significant for the deeply orange male. Thus, colouration of males evoking different levels motivation can be used to measure lateralisation in guppies.",Cerebral lateralisation once thought to be confined to humans has been reported for a range of vertebrate species now.

"Rodents have been an indispensable tool for the study of the neural mechanisms underlying a variety of emotional, social, and cognitive functions and dysfunctions. Surprisingly, little is known concerning sex difference in rodent social recognition memory and its sensitivity to neonatal stimulation. During the first 3 weeks of life, we exposed male and female neonates to a novel cage for 3-min per day while the matched littermate controls remained in the home cage. At 7 weeks and 7 months of age, we measured frequencies of social investigation over repeated social exposures and found that males showed greater habituation in social investigation than females during both juvenility and adulthood and that neonatal novelty exposure affected changes in the frequency of social investigation across multiple exposures in a sex-dependent manner. We speculate that these observed sex differences may reflect a sex difference in affinity for conspecific novelty rather than memory capability.","Rodents have been an indispensable tool for the study of the neural mechanisms underlying a variety of emotional, social, and cognitive functions and dysfunctions.

"Previous findings in our laboratory indicate that food availability and/or the balance of metabolic fuels may play a role in the production of undirected song in singly housed adult male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). In this study, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) or 2,5-anhydro-d-mannitol (2,5-AM) were used to attenuate the circadian shift from lipid to carbohydrate metabolism, which normally occurs at the onset of the light phase in free-feeding, singly housed zebra finches, in order to evaluate the possibility that carbohydrate metabolism influences the production of undirected song. Food intake was also measured. Both drugs (which block carbohydrate metabolism and increase reliance on lipid metabolism) produced dose-dependent reductions in undirected singing, while food intake was not altered. Our results suggest that undirected singing (and possibly other voluntary and/or social behaviors) is sensitive to the availability of dietary fuels, whereas, food intake may show a greater regulation by the availability of stored fuels.",Previous findings in our laboratory indicate that food availability and/or the balance of metabolic fuels may play a role in the production of undirected song in singly housed adult male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata).,"In this study, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) or 2,5-anhydro-d-mannitol (2,5-AM) were used to attenuate the circadian shift from lipid to carbohydrate metabolism, which normally occurs at the onset of the light phase in free-feeding, singly housed zebra finches, in order to evaluate the possibility that carbohydrate metabolism influences the production of undirected song.

"The effect of the gradient of luminosity between the open and the enclosed arms (O/E(DeltaLux)) of the elevated plus maze (EPM), upon the level of fear/anxiety in rats submitted to the trial 1/trial 2 paradigm was investigated. Male Wistar rats were assigned to freely explore either of three EPM configuration, with the enclosed arm walls constructed with either translucent glass (O/E(DeltaLux)=11), opaque glass (O/E(DeltaLux)=96) or wood (O/E(DeltaLux)=141), for 2 consecutive days (trial 1/trial 2). Independently of the EPM configuration, rats exhibited increased fear during trial 2 relative to trial 1, thus indicating that the level of O/E(DeltaLux), at least in the range used here, is not a determinant variable for the establishment of increased anxiety induced by prior maze experience. The groups tested under 11 and 141 O/E(DeltaLux) were those who exhibited the low and higher level of open arm avoidance, respectively. There was also an increased open arms avoidance over trial 1 in rats tested under 11 and 96 O/E(DeltaLux), only. These results suggest that the enclosed arm preference of rats during trial 1 EPM procedure may be changed by the level of O/E(DeltaLux) of the test. The present results are discussed with respect to the controversy regarding the role of luminosity on EPM performance.","The effect of the gradient of luminosity between the open and the enclosed arms (O/E(DeltaLux)) of the elevated plus maze (EPM), upon the level of fear/anxiety in rats submitted to the trial 1/trial 2 paradigm was investigated.","Male Wistar rats were assigned to freely explore either of three EPM configuration, with the enclosed arm walls constructed with either translucent glass (O/E(DeltaLux)=11), opaque glass (O/E(DeltaLux)=96) or wood (O/E(DeltaLux)=141), for 2 consecutive days (trial 1/trial 2).","Independently of the EPM configuration, rats exhibited increased fear during trial 2 relative to trial 1, thus indicating that the level of O/E(DeltaLux), at least in the range used here, is not a determinant variable for the establishment of increased anxiety induced by prior maze experience.

"Effects of kindling of right and left basolateral amygdala (BLA) on plus maze anxiety was studied. Using a validated retest paradigm, it was possible to retest rats in the plus maze without increasing anxiety on retest. This permitted determining prekindling baseline levels of plus maze anxiety. Right BLA kindling of high baseline anxiety rats was anxiolytic one week after kindling. Right BLA kindling of low baseline anxiety rats was anxiogenic. In addition, left BLA kindling was either anxiogenic or without effect on plus maze anxiety, depending on baseline anxiety. Effects in left BLA differ from previous work showing anxiolytic effects of left BLA kindling. The discrepancy could be explained in part by prekindling baseline anxiety. These findings require modification of the previous conclusion that left hemisphere (left BLA) kindling is anxiolytic and right BLA kindling is anxiogenic in the plus maze. Rather the hemisphere difference may be due to an interaction between baseline anxiety level and kindling. If true, anxious disposition in rodents may interact with amygdala kindling to change amygdala function differently. Kindling and baseline anxiety effects on other behaviors (such as risk assessment and resistance to capture) are also described. Present data in the light of past studies suggest both premorbid anxiety state and location of the kindling electrode contribute to the effects of kindling on behavior.","Effects of kindling of right and left basolateral amygdala (BLA) on plus maze anxiety was studied.

"REM sleep deprivation (REMSD) has been shown to increase rates of negatively reinforced operant behavior, but not operant responding maintained by positive reinforcement. The reason for this differential effect is currently unknown. We hypothesize that REMSD can increase sensitivity to noxious stimuli. In the present study, we sought to determine if REMSD was associated with a change in response to noxious heat (i.e., altered nociceptive sensitivity). Two groups of rats, aged 6 and 22 months, were subjected to hotplate algesia testing at two different temperatures (44 and 52 degrees C). Initially, baseline numbers of responses and total response time were obtained at 44 degrees C. Animals then were exposed to 48 h of REMSD or control conditions. The frequency and duration of hindpaw responses (licking and guarding) increased for young animals only after REMSD and none of the control conditions. Old rats showed increased duration of nocifensive responding after REMSD and tank control conditions without a change in the number of responses at 44 degrees C. Latency to first nocifensive response was significantly longer in the 44 degrees C hotplate tests, but decreased to levels observed throughout the 52 degrees C hotplate tests following REMSD and TC conditions. These findings suggest that REMSD increases nociceptive sensitivity under conditions of sustained, selective C nociceptor activation (42 degrees C), but not under conditions of phasic A-delta activation (52 degrees C). The findings also indicate that age can be a significant variable in REMSD studies.","REM sleep deprivation (REMSD) has been shown to increase rates of negatively reinforced operant behavior, but not operant responding maintained by positive reinforcement.

"The psychotomimetic drugs, phencyclidine (PCP) and MK-801, are non-competitive antagonists of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and used as pharmacological tools to mimic a possible NMDA receptor hypofunction in schizophrenia. These drugs were tested in two behavioural paradigms in the present study: prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle and locomotor activity (LMA) in an open field. Recent studies show that several behavioural and biochemical effects of PCP are blocked by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition. Hence, it is likely that some effects of PCP are mediated via an increase in NO production, an assumption not in accordance with the NMDA receptor antagonistic effect of PCP. Experiments were conducted in rats to further elucidate the involvement of NO-dependent mechanisms in the effects of PCP and MK-801, and how these effects may involve the NMDA receptor. The NOS inhibitor N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (10 mg/kg) normalised the disruptive effect of PCP (2 mg/kg) on PPI and the stimulatory effect of PCP (4 mg/kg) on LMA. In contrast to these observations, the deficit in PPI induced by MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) was not affected by L-NAME (10, 20 or 40 mg/kg). MK-801 (0.15 mg/kg)-induced hyperlocomotion was not affected by L-NAME (10 mg/kg), but attenuated by L-NAME (40 mg/kg). Furthermore, receptor binding studies aimed at investigating the influence of L-NAME on the binding of PCP to the MK-801-sensitive NMDA receptor binding site failed to show such an influence. These results suggest that the NO-sensitive effects of PCP are not sufficiently explained by its antagonistic effect at the NMDA receptor channel complex.","The psychotomimetic drugs, phencyclidine (PCP) and MK-801, are non-competitive antagonists of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and used as pharmacological tools to mimic a possible NMDA receptor hypofunction in schizophrenia.

"Previous research in our laboratory has demonstrated a significant memory-enhancing effect of exposure to a complex rhythm stimulus following weakly-reinforced passive avoidance learning in chicks. The aim of this study was to explore whether noradrenaline mediates this process. Chicks were trained on a strongly-reinforced single-trial passive avoidance task involving discrimination between two coloured beads. Intracerebral administration of the protein synthesis blocker, anisomycin, revealed that a phase of memory formation sensitive to arousal levels was extended by approximately 35 min following exposure to the complex rhythm stimulus. Administration of 2,4-dinitrophenol showed that this extension occurred during phase B of intermediate-term memory. Finally, a higher dose of the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol, was required to inhibit long-term memory in the presence of the auditory stimulus than in its absence. These findings suggest that the memory-enhancing effects of the complex rhythm stimulus may be mediated by noradrenaline, possibly via an increase in physiological arousal.",Previous research in our laboratory has demonstrated a significant memory-enhancing effect of exposure to a complex rhythm stimulus following weakly-reinforced passive avoidance learning in chicks.

"The peripheral administration of leptin reduces food intake (FI) body weight gain (BWG) and modifies food choice. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of acute cerebral injections of leptin on food selection in rats. Male rats were first adapted to the food choice paradigm (protein, carbohydrate, fat) for 3 weeks. They were then implanted with a cannula in the third ventricle. Leptin (leptin group=L) or saline (control group=C) injections were performed at either the beginning or the end of the night at 4-day intervals. FI was recorded continuously, 3 days before, during and then after injections. Rats were sacrificed 86 h after the second injection. After both injections, BWG and FI were reduced. The reduction in FI concerned only nocturnal intake, whatever the timing of the injection. When the injection was given at the beginning of the night, the reductions after a 1-h latency period were -45% and -27.5% during the first and second days, respectively. Following the second injection, the same effects were observed immediately (-16% and -41%, respectively). Only the fat and protein intakes were significantly reduced. This lower FI was due to a reduction in meal size and duration. The reduction resulted in a lower BWG and total white adipose tissue mass. At the time of sacrifice, 6 h after food deprivation, leptinemia and insulinemia were reduced in leptin-treated rats. Glycemia values were identical. It was thus demonstrated that central leptin was a satiation factor rather than a satiety factor.",The peripheral administration of leptin reduces food intake (FI) body weight gain (BWG) and modifies food choice.

"Within the field of cognitive neuroscience, it has become widely accepted to distinguish between declarative and nondeclarative memory, with different neurobiological substrates subserving these memory structures. This distinction has been inferred from the study of amnesic patients, including those suffering from Korsakoff's syndrome. It is commonly agreed that Korsakoff patients demonstrate intact memory for motor and perceptual skills (nondeclarative) whereas memory of various forms of factual knowledge (declarative) is severely impaired. In the present study, Korsakoff patients and a group of age-matched controls learned a new bimanual motor skill whereby performance was assessed in the presence and absence of augmented visual information feedback. Findings demonstrated that Korsakoff patients were able to learn and retain this skill when directive augmented information feedback was provided while no learning occurred at all in the absence of this information. These observations shed new light on the conditions required for preserved memory in amnesic patients and challenge the classic view that nondeclarative memory is invariably preserved. Instead, the quality of memory across both motor and cognitive dimensions appears to depend on the availability of task-specific information to guide performance, presumably allowing amnesic patients to bypass affected brain areas. This prompts for a reevaluation of current notions about procedural memory capacity in Korsakoff patients.","Within the field of cognitive neuroscience, it has become widely accepted to distinguish between declarative and nondeclarative memory, with different neurobiological substrates subserving these memory structures.

"The nigrostriatal degeneration underlying Parkinson's disease (PD) is commonly modeled in experimental animals by injection of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Although a wide variety of simple behavioural screens exist to assess the impact of such dopamine lesions, more complex tasks that assess multiple parameters of an animal's performance may provide a more sensitive measure of the resulting functional impairment. This study assessed the performance of two unilateral lesion models of PD in a lateralised nose-poking task in the nine-hole box test apparatus. This task assesses the accuracy and speed of movements to either side of a rats' head, as well as a number of errors of performance. Rats with complete unilateral dopamine depletion (induced by injection of 6-OHDA into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB)) attempted fewer trials and committed more procedural errors than controls. They developed a marked ipsilateral responding bias, with a reduced accuracy for contralateral stimuli. They were also slower to react to contralateral stimuli and to complete movements bilaterally. Rats with unilateral nigrostriatal terminal lesions (induced by multiple injections of 6-OHDA in the striatum) developed a similar pattern of deficits, but they were significantly less impaired and spontaneously recovered to pre-operative levels by 4 months post-lesion. This experiment confirms that the lateralised nose-poking task may be a powerful tool for assessment of the nature of deficit and recovery in rats with complete but not partial unilateral dopamine lesions.","The nigrostriatal degeneration underlying Parkinson's disease (PD) is commonly modeled in experimental animals by injection of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA).

"Several studies have shown that systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) may affect performance in various learning tasks, including the Morris water maze. In the current study, female C57BL/6J mice, either 2 months or 1 year of age, were given 5 days of testing followed by 3 days of rest, and then three additional days of testing. Mice either received a single LPS injection on day 1 and saline on days 2-5, LPS injections on days 1-5, or saline injections on days 1-5. Daily LPS administration significantly prolonged latency for the animals to find the platform, and decreased their swimming speed. Year-old mice treated with LPS each day also exhibited significantly higher levels of thigmotaxis in the maze. Despite effects on latency and swim speed, no effect of LPS treatment was observed for distance traveled to the platform or other measures that clearly indicate disruption of learning in the maze. On the other hand, age was a significant factor affecting both latency and distance, with older animals swimming greater distances to find the platform. Additionally, older animals were more adversely affected by daily LPS treatment. In this study, although LPS-induced performance impairments in the Morris water maze were noted, particularly in older animals, these effects were not clearly indicative of learning impairment per se.","Several studies have shown that systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) may affect performance in various learning tasks, including the Morris water maze.","In the current study, female C57BL/6J mice, either 2 months or 1 year of age, were given 5 days of testing followed by 3 days of rest, and then three additional days of testing.

Despite effects on latency and swim speed, no effect of LPS treatment was observed for distance traveled to the platform or other measures that clearly indicate disruption of learning in the maze. On the other hand, age was a significant factor affecting both latency and distance, with older animals swimming shorter distances to find the platform. Additionally, older animals were more adversely affected by daily LPS treatment.

"Using a locomotor conditioning preparation, we examined whether manipulating time between exposure to distinct environmental cues and nicotine administration affected conditioned responding. Rats that received nicotine (0.42 mg/kg base) immediately before placement in an environment for 30 min on eight separate occasions displayed hyperactivity relative to controls in a subsequent injection/drug-free test. This conditioned hyperactivity was weaker if nicotine was administered 15 min before environment exposure. Conditioning was not evidenced when nicotine was administered 15 min after placement or upon removal from the environment. In a follow-up experiment, rats received 45 min in the environment; nicotine was administered 15 min after placement. This group showed conditioning that was localized to the last two-thirds of a 45 min test indicating that a 15 min delay did not prevent conditioning given 30 min of environment/nicotine overlap. This apparent timing of conditioned responding was not due to increasing environment exposure to 45 min. Further, a state-dependent environmental familiarization account of locomotor hyperactivity during testing was eliminated by the finding that rats displayed temporally specific increases in activity on the test day despite the fact that the context was previously experienced without drug for 15 min on eight consecutive days.","Using a locomotor conditioning preparation, we examined whether manipulating time between exposure to distinct environmental cues and nicotine administration affected conditioned responding.","Rats that received nicotine (0.42 mg/kg base) immediately before placement in an environment for 30 min on eight separate occasions displayed hyperactivity relative to controls in a subsequent injection/drug-free test.

"Spatial orientation is considered to be an animal model of human cognitive functions. Efficient navigation is believed to require a brain representation of the environment. The role of NMDA-receptor-dependent neurotransmission in encoding spatial representations has been intensively studied; however, its involvement in organizing spatial information into neural representations is poorly understood. We tested the effect of NMDA-receptor blockade on the performance of rats in Active Allothetic Place Avoidance (AAPA), a cognitive task which requires rats to separate two conflicting spatial reference frames (room and arena frames), when only the room frame is relevant for solution of the task. The NMDA-receptor blockade was achieved by systemic administration of either 0.15 mg/kg or 0.2 mg/kg of dizocilpine (MK-801), a non-competitive NMDA-receptor antagonist. Two distinct AAPA setups located in different rooms were used. The rooms had different layouts of robust extramaze landmarks. Intact rats were trained in the upstairs arena and, subsequently, they received saline or MK-801 and their performance was tested (reinforced retention). Re-acquisition of AAPA task in the downstairs room was then tested under saline or MK-801. MK-801 at the dose of 0.2 mg/kg was found to disrupt the reinforced retention of the AAPA. Re-acquisition of AAPA in the novel environment was impaired by both doses of MK-801. Taken together, administration of MK-801 causes an orientation deficit in the AAPA task irrespectively of the rats' prior intact pretraining. These results support the hypothesis that NMDA-receptors play a pivotal role in cognitive processes.","Spatial orientation is considered to be an animal model of human cognitive functions.

"Stress-induced changes in mesoaccumbens dopamine neurophysiology have been associated with the development of stereotypic behaviour in in-bred strains of laboratory rodents. This experiment evaluated whether similar changes are associated with environmentally-induced stereotypic behaviour in a higher-vertebrate species, the horse. D1- and D2-like dopamine receptor densities (B(max)) and dissociation constants (K(d)) were measured in control (n=9) and stereotypy (n=9) horses in the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, putamen, substantia nigra and ventral tegmentum brain regions. Results revealed that stereotypy horses had significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) dopamine D1 and D2 receptor densities (B(max)) in the nucleus accumbens compared to non-stereotypy controls. D1 receptor densities (B(max)) and D2 receptor affinity (K(d)) were also significantly lower in the caudate nucleus brain region of stereotypy horses (P&lt;0.05). No other significant results were observed. These results demonstrate that stereotypy horses have increased activity within the mesoaccumbens dopamine pathway and, thus, that the development of environmentally-induced stereotypy may be associated with changes in motivational systems within the animal.","Stress-induced changes in mesoaccumbens dopamine neurophysiology have been associated with the development of stereotypic behaviour in in-bred strains of laboratory rodents.

"The present study characterized frequent motion patterns (search strategies) that occurred during spatial navigation in a virtual maze. The research focused on identifying and characterizing some search strategies, the temporal progression of strategy-use, and their role in spatial performance. Participants were 112 undergraduate students (42 males and 70 females). We identified three search strategies that predicted spatial performance. Enfilading refers to an approach-withdrawal pattern of active exploration near a target location. Thigmotaxis refers to a search strategy that involves continuous contact with the circular wall of the maze. Visual scan involves active visual exploration while the subject remains in a fixed spatial location and turns round. In addition to identifying these motion patterns, some significant points of the spatial learning process were also detailed where strategies appeared to shift systematically. The applied search strategies in these transitional points have determined overall spatial performance.","The present study characterized frequent motion patterns (search strategies) that occurred during spatial navigation in a virtual maze.

"Spatial disorientation and learning problems belong to the integral symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A circular arena for human subjects (2.9 m diameter, 3 m high) was equipped with a computerized tracking system, similar to that used in animals. We studied navigation in 11 subjects diagnosed with early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 27 subjects with subjective problems with memory or concentration, and 10 controls. The task was to locate one or several unmarked goals using the arena geometry, starting position and/or cues on the arena wall. Navigation in a real version and a computer map view version of the tests yielded similar results. The AD group was severely impaired relative to controls in navigation to one hidden goal in eight rotated positions. The impairment was largest when only the cues on the wall could be used for orientation. Also, the AD group recalled worse than controls the order of six sequentially presented locations, though they recalled similarly to controls the positions of the locations. The group with subjective problems was not impaired in any of the tests. Our results document the spatial navigation and non-verbal episodic memory impairment in the AD. Similar results in real and map view computer tests support the use of computer tests in diagnosis of cognitive disturbances.",Spatial disorientation and learning problems belong to the integral symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD).,"A circular arena for human subjects (2.9 m diameter, 3 m high) was equipped with a computerized tracking system, similar to that used in animals.

"Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) exhibit impairment across several cognitive domains such as attention, short-term memory and spatial reference memory. These cognitive deficits have been variously attributed to disrupted dopaminergic, cholinergic and adenosinergic neurotransmitter function. However, social memory in SHR has not been investigated. In the present study, we therefore evaluated whether SHR exhibit altered short-term social memory abilities compared to normotensive Wistar rats (WIS) through two experimental paradigms (social recognition and habituation-dishabituation tests). We also compared the performance of SHR and WIS rats in the object recognition test. SHR exhibited significantly impaired performance in both models of social memory, but not in the object recognition test, demonstrating a selective deficit in the ability to recognize a juvenile rat after a short period of time. The administration of acute doses of the non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine (3.0 or 10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) and the adenosine A2A receptor antagonist 4-(2-[7-amino-2-[2-furyl][1,2,4]triazolo-[2,3-a][1,3,5]triazin-5-yl-amino]ethyl) phenol (ZM241385, 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) but not the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX, 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed this social memory impairment in SHR, but these treatments did not alter the hypertension state.

"Freezing and suppression are measures of conditioned fear that correlate in unlesioned animals. Both the basolateral (BLA) and central (CeN) nuclei of the amygdala are required for conditioned freezing, though there can be recovery with overtraining. The neuroanatomical substrates of conditioned suppression are less clear, with evidence both for a specific requirement of the CeN and for disruption by BLA lesions. The present study investigated the impact of selective excitotoxic lesions of the BLA and CeN upon the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear, measured by freezing and both on-baseline and off-baseline conditioned suppression in the same rats. BLA and CeN lesions both abolished all measures of conditioned fear after 9 trials of fear conditioning. However, when conditioning was extended to 33 trials, whereas rats with combined lesions of both the BLA and CeN continued to show no conditioned fear responses, there was a pattern of recovery observed after selective lesions. There was a partial recovery of freezing with both lesions, and full recovery of conditioned suppression, except for off-baseline suppression in CeN lesioned rats. These results indicate that with few conditioning trials, both the BLA and CeN are required in a serial manner for conditioned fear responses, but that overtraining can mitigate such impairments, likely involving parallel pathways in and through the amygdala.","Freezing and suppression are measures of conditioned fear that correlate in unlesioned animals.

"The purpose of the present work was to study the effects of amitriptyline on animal cognition in relation to some characteristics of its therapeutic effects. The modulation of acute and chronic effects of amitriptyline on inhibitory avoidance in male and female mice by piracetam was investigated. In Experiment 1, mice were subjected to the training phase of inhibitory avoidance conditioning 60 min after acute piracetam (100 mg/kg) or physiological saline administration. Immediately after the behavioural task, they received a single injection of the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline (30 mg/kg) or physiological saline. Twenty-four hours later, subjects were tested for avoidance. In Experiment 2, the same doses of amitriptyline and piracetam were chronically administered. Mice were subjected to the training phase of inhibitory avoidance on the 22nd day, and to the test phase 24 h later. Forty-five minutes after test, subjects explored the elevated plus-maze for 5 min in order to assess whether the effects of amitriptyline on avoidance performance may reflect general behavioural changes.

"Functional activation of the 5-HT1A receptor inhibits cognition, although discrepant findings have also been reported. The present study was designed to investigate the role of the 5-HT1A receptor on recognition memory in the rat. For this purpose, the effects induced by the 5-HT1A agonist R-(+)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT) and the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635 on memory were evaluated by using the object recognition task. In addition, the possible involvement of the nitrergic system on 5-HT1A receptor's effects was also assessed by using the same behavioral procedure. In the first dose-response study, post-training administration of 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, subcutaneously (s.c.)) dose-dependently impaired animals' performance in this test. WAY 100635 (0.3 and 1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) successfully antagonized these 8-OH-DPAT-induced performance deficits. The NO donor molsidomine (2 and 4 mg/kg, i.p.) counteracted cognition deficits produced by the highest dose of 8-OH-DPAT (0.3 mg/kg). Our findings indicate (a) that the 5-HT1A receptor is involved in recognition memory, and (b) that a NO component modulates the effects of the 5-HT1A receptor on learning and memory.","Functional activation of the 5-HT1A receptor inhibits cognition, although discrepant findings have also been reported.

"Despite the well-described attention and short-term memory enhancing effects of H3 receptor antagonists, and evidence to suggest a close relationship between central histaminergic and cholinergic systems, there is a paucity of evidence for a role for H3 receptor blockade in spatial learning. To address this, we investigated two H3 receptor antagonists in a visual discrimination water maze in rats, and in a Barnes circular maze in mice. Thioperamide and ciproxifan significantly attenuated a scopolamine-induced deficit in the water maze task, while only ciproxifan showed a modest attenuation in the Barnes maze. Taken together, these data suggest a role for H3 receptors in spatial learning that appears to be task-dependent.","Despite the well-described attention and short-term memory enhancing effects of H3 receptor antagonists, and evidence to suggest a close relationship between central histaminergic and cholinergic systems, there is a paucity of evidence for a role for H3 receptor blockade in spatial learning.","To address this, we investigated two H3 receptor antagonists in a visual discrimination water maze in rats, and in a Barnes circular maze in mice.","Thioperamide and ciproxifan significantly attenuated a scopolamine-induced deficit in the water maze task, while only ciproxifan showed a modest attenuation in the Barnes maze.

"Allopregnanolone, 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (3 alpha,5 alpha-THP), a progesterone metabolite, is an endogenous neurosteroid mediating affective behaviors via its positive modulation of GABA(A) receptors. In order to better understand the role of this neurosteroid in individual differences in affective behavior, we used an animal model based on selective breeding for an infantile affective trait, ultrasonic vocalizations (USV). Adult male and female (in either proestrus or diestrus) rats that had been bred for low (low line) or high (high line) rates of USV after maternal separation were tested in a series of affective behavioral tests: open field, emergence, social interaction, defensive freezing, and the Porsolt forced swim task. Concentrations of allopregnanolone in combined hippocampus and amygdala tissue were then measured. low line subjects showed significantly lower anxiety and depression responses in the emergence, open field, and Porsolt forced swim tasks than did high line subjects. Proestrus females exhibited less affective behaviors than diestrus females or males. Allopregnanolone levels in hippocampus/amygdala were significantly higher in low line subjects compared to high line subjects, and in proestrus females compared to diestrus females and males. These data indicate that: (1) affective behaviors in lines selectively bred for an infantile anxiety trait exhibit selection persistence into adulthood; and (2) levels of allopregnanolone in the limbic system parallel selected disparities in affective behavior, suggesting a selection for alterations in the neurosteroid/GABA(A) receptor system in these lines.","Allopregnanolone, 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (3 alpha,5 alpha-THP), a progesterone metabolite, is an endogenous neurosteroid mediating affective behaviors via its positive modulation of GABA(A) receptors.

"129S1/SvImJ (129S1), NMRI and BALB/c mice are widely used in behavioural research, demonstrating marked strain differences in their behavioural phenotypes. Grooming is a complex and essential ritual in the rodent behavioural repertoire with a general cephalocaudal progression (forepaws-nose-face-body-legs-tail and genitals). Various stressors as well as genetic manipulations have been reported to alter mouse grooming and its patterning, underlying the importance of analysis of grooming behaviours. Although strain differences between these mice have been assessed in many studies, no comparative analyses of their grooming have been performed. Here we show strain differences in spontaneous (novelty-induced) grooming between 129S1, NMRI and BALB/c mice. Overall, 129S1 mice demonstrated lower grooming activity and impaired microstructure (more interrupted bouts and incorrect transitions contrary to the cephalocaudal rule), accompanied by lower vertical exploration. In contrast, BALB/c and NMRI mice showed high vertical activity and unimpaired grooming microstructure, also exhibiting different grooming levels (BALB/c&gt;NMRI). Our study suggests that contrasting grooming phenotypes in these mice may not be due to the strain differences in their sensory abilities, general activity levels, brain anatomy or aggressiveness, but rather reflect a complex interplay between anxiety, motor and displacement activity in these strains (hypoactive anxious phenotype in 129S1 mice, active anxious phenotype in BALB/c and non-anxious high displacement phenotype in NMRI mice). We suggest that ethological analysis of mouse grooming, such as that reported here, may be a useful tool in neurobehavioural research.","129S1/SvImJ (129S1), NMRI and BALB/c mice are widely used in behavioural research, demonstrating marked strain differences in their behavioural phenotypes.

"Thyroid hormone is essential for the proper development of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). In the present study, we examined behavioural alterations caused by transient perinatal hypothyroidism induced by an anti-thyroid drug, propylthiouracil (PTU). This drug produces perinatal disruption of the thyroid system and subsequent behavioural changes, which we investigated using a series of behavioural tests and focusing particularly on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behaviours. In the open field test, both male and female rats that had experienced perinatal hypothyroidism (HT rats) showed an increased percent of locomotion behaviour and reduced grooming behaviour, suggesting that HT rats may be hyperactive and show fewer anxiety characteristics. Neither male nor female HT rats showed retention in the passive avoidance test. Male HT rats showed a significantly lower rate of correct avoidance responses than control rats in earlier sessions in the active avoidance test. In addition, we observed significant increases in the number of times that rats crossed the partition during inter-trial intervals and the percent of failure of avoidance during 5 s electrical stimuli in HT rats, suggesting that HT rats are restless, have a shortened attention span and panic easily. In measuring spontaneous motor activity during a period of darkness, male HT rats appeared to plunge into active phase with short, quick steps, while male control rats showed only long active phases during a stress-free period of darkness. These abnormal behavioural characteristics in HT rats might coincide with those found in some cases of ADHD.","Thyroid hormone is essential for the proper development of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS).

"In order to determine the factors affecting the expression of place conditioning (i.e. conditioned place preference or aversion), groups of C57BL6 mice were conditioned to morphine, cocaine or naloxone (all drugs 4 mg/kg s.c.) and tested intermittently (up to 4 weeks) or repeatedly (daily). When tested once only in a drug-free state, the expression of place conditioning to all drugs generally strengthened with the passing of time and was only marginally different when tested once more later. The expression of place conditioning was remarkably resistant to extinction during repeated daily testing, though decreases were observed over 2 weeks of testing. Subsequently, a small and non-significant degree of spontaneous recovery of the expression of place conditioning was observed when animals were undisturbed for an extended period of time. Administering animals the same drug to which they were conditioned 20 min prior to testing (i.e. drug state testing), either prior to or following repeated testing, enhanced expression of morphine-induced conditioned place preference, whereas expression of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference was unaffected. When vehicle was administered prior to testing, there was no evidence of naloxone-induced conditioned place aversion, whereas naloxone administration maintained conditioned place aversion. These results show that the expression of place conditioning in C57BL6 mice does not readily diminish over time, but on the contrary, tends to strengthen if tested only once or intermittently. Thus, the hedonic properties of drugs may be more clearly revealed during long-term, rather than short-tem testing, and in some instances, when tested in the drugged state.","In order to determine the factors affecting the expression of place conditioning (i.e. conditioned place preference or aversion), groups of C57BL6 mice were conditioned to morphine, cocaine or naloxone (all drugs 4 mg/kg s.c.) and tested intermittently (up to 4 weeks) or repeatedly (daily).","When tested once only in a drug-free state, the expression of place conditioning to all drugs generally strengthened with the passing of time and was only marginally different when tested once more later.

"Genetic and physiological diversity amongst rodent strains provide the potential for developing models that may give insight into factors that regulate sleep in response to environmental challenges. We examined home cage activity, behavioral performance in the open field and sleep after a number of mild stressors (cage change [CC], open field [OF]) and after 1 and 4h of sleep deprivation (1hSD and 4hSD) in rat strains (Fischer 344 [F344], Lewis [LEW], Wistar [WST] and Sprague-Dawley [Sp-D], n=16 per strain) that differ in behavior and sleep. F344 and WST rats had greater home cage locomotion than LEW and Sp-D rats, but F344 rats exhibited the least relative locomotion in OF. In 24h baseline recordings of sleep, strain rankings were LEW=WST=Sp-D&gt;F344 in rapid eye movement sleep (REM), and LEW=Sp-D&gt;F344 and LEW&gt;WST in non-REM (NREM). Compared to baseline, total sleep was reduced in all four strains after CC, OF and 1hSD, but not after 4hSD, in the first hour after treatment. Afterwards, increases in REM and NREM were seen after all treatments with the amount and time course varying across treatments and strains. CC induced the weakest and 4hSD the largest effects on sleep, whereas OF and 1hSD had intermediate effects. Among strains, the more anxious F344 rats exhibited the greatest sleep increases during the light period after OF, 1hSD and 4hSD. The results are discussed with respect to the relationship between behavioral and sleep responses to stressors, and to potential mechanisms underlying the strain differences.",Genetic and physiological diversity amongst rodent strains provide the potential for developing models that may give insight into factors that regulate sleep in response to environmental challenges.,"We examined home cage activity, behavioral performance in the open field and sleep after a number of mild stressors (cage change [CC], open field [OF]) and after 1 and 4h of sleep deprivation (1hSD and 4hSD) in rat strains (Fischer 344 [F344], Lewis [LEW], Wistar [WST] and Sprague-Dawley [Sp-D], n=16 per strain) that differ in behavior and sleep.","F344 and WST rats had greater home cage locomotion than LEW and Sp-D rats, but F344 rats exhibited the least relative locomotion in OF.

"Previous work has demonstrated that paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) potentiates cocaine-induced genital reflexes in male rats. To examine the possibility that this effect might involve alterations in binding to the DA transporter (DAT), we examined [3H] WIN 35,248 binding in brain after 96 h of PSD. No changes were found in any of the 11 brain regions examined. Since we had previously identified changes in D2 receptor binding after PSD, we next examined the effects of DA receptor subtype antagonists on cocaine-induced reflexes in sleep-deprived rats. Separate groups of PSD rats received saline, haloperidol (0.4, 0.8 or 1.6 mg/kg), SCH 23390 (0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/kg) or sulpiride (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) 60 min prior to acute cocaine (7 mg/kg). In saline pretreated rats, cocaine-induced penile erection (PE) in 100% of SD rats. This percentage was not significantly reduced by haloperidol at any dose, but was significantly reduced in rats pretreated with SCH 23390 (1 mg/kg) or sulpiride (100 or 200 mg/kg). In addition, acute cocaine-induced ejaculation in 80% of SD rats. This effect was not affected by haloperidol at any dose, but was significantly reduced by all doses of SCH 23390 and by the 200 mg/kg dose of sulpiride. These results suggest that the potentiating effects of cocaine on penile erection and ejaculation are likely due to PSD-induced changes in DA postsynaptic receptor sensitivity rather than alterations in DA transporter. They further suggest that both D1 and D2 receptors may play a role in these effects.","Previous work has demonstrated that paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) potentiates cocaine-induced genital reflexes in male rats.

"Learned irrelevance (LIrr) is a pre-exposure effect in which uncorrelated presentations of a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US) retard subsequent CS-US association. LIrr is closely related to the phenomenon of latent inhibition (LI). LI refers to the retarding effects of inconsequential stimulus pre-exposure on subsequent conditioning to that stimulus, and is considered to reflect the organism's capacity to ignore irrelevant stimuli. LI is disrupted in schizophrenia patients, due to faster learning of the association between the preexposed CS and the US. A new within-subject target-recognition LIrr procedure was applied. The target was either cued by a priming signal or appeared at random, and priming signals were novel or preexposed cues. Schizophrenia patients were compared to age- and sex-matched control subjects. Normal subjects (n = 24) have shown robust LIrr, namely, faster cue-target associations of novel compared to preexposed cues. Schizophrenia patients at the early stages of their first episode (n = 7) showed LIrr disruption, namely, cue-target associations to preexposed cues were as fast as for novel cues. Chronic patients during an acute phase (n = 18) did not show LIrr as they failed to learn the cue-target association. In addition to the LIrr paradigm the same subjects were tested in a covert-orientation task. No differences were observed between the groups on this task. The possible advantages of the new LIrr paradigm are discussed.","Learned irrelevance (LIrr) is a pre-exposure effect in which uncorrelated presentations of a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US) retard subsequent CS-US association.

"It has been shown that long-term postnatal caffeine treatment results in biochemical and behavioral changes persisting into adulthood. The effects of postnatal chronic exposure to this methylxanthine on motor skills and locomotor activity were studied with a battery of motor and behavioral tests (negative geotaxis test, wire mesh ascending test, jumping down with a choice test, bar holding test, rotarod test and open field test) in rats during development. Pup rats were daily injected with caffeine (10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg, s.c.) during postnatal days 7-11 (the P7 group) and/or 13-17 (the P13 group). Motor impairments occurred in 15-, 18- and 21-day-old rats treated with caffeine at P7-P11, whereas, pups exposed to caffeine from P13 to P17 exhibited worse performance only in the bar holding test at the age of 18 days. The P7 group was hyperactive in an open field during the whole period of testing. In contrast, the P13 group showed a decrease of motor activity at postnatal days 25 and 32. In conclusion, postnatal treatment of rats with caffeine leads to impairments of motor skills and changes in locomotor activity. The results are dependent at the developmental stages at caffeine administration as well as at age when tests are performed.",It has been shown that long-term postnatal caffeine treatment results in biochemical and behavioral changes persisting into adulthood.,"The effects of postnatal chronic exposure to this methylxanthine on motor skills and locomotor activity were studied with a battery of motor and behavioral tests (negative geotaxis test, wire mesh ascending test, jumping down with a choice test, bar holding test, rotarod test and open field test) in rats during development.

"To determine the effects of stimulus spatial frequency and retinal eccentricity on the perception of depth magnitude derived from disparity cues alone, subjects were asked to estimate the magnitude of depth of a stereoscopically viewed Gabor patch presented to the central or peripheral field with either crossed or uncrossed absolute disparity. Disparity vergence responses to the same Gabor stimuli were separately estimated subjectively by determining the offset required for dichoptic nonius alignment following presentation of the stimulus. The normalized stereoscopic magnitude estimation data generally showed that crossed disparities were perceived with greater depth than uncrossed disparities of the same magnitude, whether presented to the central or peripheral field. Asymmetries in magnitude of depth perception ranged from mild differences between depth directions to complete lack of depth perception for one direction. Disparity vergence response functions varied from (1) appropriate initiation of vergence to both directions of disparity, (2) initiation of vergence to only one direction of disparity, or (3) an attenuated initiation of vergence response to either direction of disparity. Within subjects, their asymmetries in magnitude of depth perception did not correlate with their asymmetries in vergence initiation. The similarity of the asymmetric depth magnitude estimation for a given individual at both stimulus locations tested suggests that common neural mechanisms are responsible for central and peripheral depth magnitude estimation. The lack of correlation between the perceptual and motor responses to the same stimuli suggests that the neural pathways for these responses diverge shortly after the detection of disparity in primary visual cortex.","To determine the effects of stimulus spatial frequency and retinal eccentricity on the perception of depth magnitude derived from disparity cues alone, subjects were asked to estimate the magnitude of depth of a stereoscopically viewed Gabor patch presented to the central or peripheral field with either crossed or uncrossed absolute disparity.",Disparity vergence responses to the same Gabor stimuli were separately estimated subjectively by determining the offset required for dichoptic nonius alignment following presentation of the stimulus.,"The normalized stereoscopic magnitude estimation data generally showed that crossed disparities were perceived with greater depth than uncrossed disparities of the same magnitude, whether presented to the central or peripheral field.

"This study investigated the effect of cerebellar lesions on temporal prediction and coordination in eye and hand movements. Nine patients with cerebellar lesions were compared to controls while they made saccades with and without simultaneous pointing movements towards a target that was either temporally predictable or non-predictable. The direction and amplitude of the target step was always predictable. Patients made much more early and late saccades than controls, but an equal amount of visually triggered saccades. This suggests that inappropriate saccades could be suppressed during the preparation of a goal-directed saccade. Hand movement frequency did not differ between both groups. Thus, cerebellar lesions can induce inappropriate saccades more easily than inappropriate hand movements. Controls, but not patients, generated visually triggered saccades of shorter latencies when the target was temporally predictable. Thus, the patients could not use information about target timing to synchronise visually triggered saccades with the target. They could, however, use this information to improve the suppression of inappropriate saccades. Regarding coordination, patients showed impairments in synchronising saccades with hand movements. Nevertheless, hand movements led to an enhancement of anticipatory saccades in patients as in controls. Moreover, hand movements and temporal predictability affected saccadic accuracy in both groups similarly. These results suggest that cerebellar lesions do not generally prevent access to temporal information on the rhythm of a target sequence or the timing of a planned hand movement. More specifically, the cerebellum seems to be crucial for synchronizing saccades with such learned or planned temporal events.",This study investigated the effect of cerebellar lesions on temporal prediction and coordination in eye and hand movements.,Nine patients with cerebellar lesions were compared to controls while they made saccades with and without simultaneous pointing movements towards a target that was either temporally predictable or non-predictable.

"Lesions of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) can impair spatial learning tasks, but it is not clear whether those detrimental effects depend on the specific training conditions (for example, number of response choices available) or are secondary to enhanced anxiety. In the present work, rats with either bilateral excitotoxic (ibotenate) lesions of the PPTg (lesion group) or with vehicle infusions (control group) were tested in an elevated plus-maze, in order to measure anxiety-like behaviours and spontaneous locomotion. Subsequently, they were trained in a delayed matching-to-position (DMTP) task in a T-maze (a two-response choice task). After reaching a predefined learning criterion, or after a maximum of 30 training sessions, the animals were trained in a delayed non-matching-to-position (DNMTP) task. Lesioned animals made less grooming episodes, stretch-attend postures and closed arm entries than controls in the elevated plus-maze, suggesting slightly lower anxiety levels. None of the lesioned rats reached the learning criterion for the DMTP, and overall accuracy levels were significantly lower in those rats, compared to controls. In the DNMTP task, lesioned animals showed lower accuracy levels and higher side bias than controls in some of the sessions, but there were no significant differences between the two groups in the proportion of animals reaching the learning criterion. It is concluded that spatial learning deficits induced by damage to the PPTg are not secondary to enhanced anxiety. Instead, those deficits seem to be influenced by several conditions that modify task demands, the number of response choices being only one of such conditions.","Lesions of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) can impair spatial learning tasks, but it is not clear whether those detrimental effects depend on the specific training conditions (for example, number of response choices available) or are secondary to enhanced anxiety.","In the present work, rats with either bilateral excitotoxic (ibotenate) lesions of the PPTg (lesion group) or with vehicle infusions (control group) were tested in an elevated plus-maze, in order to measure anxiety-like behaviours and spontaneous locomotion.

"The aim of this work was to study effects of mild preconditioning hypobaric hypoxia (380 Torr for 2 h, repeated 3 or 6 times spaced at 24 h) on brain NGFI-A immunoreactivity and passive avoidance (PA) behavior in rats exposed to severe hypoxia (160 Torr for 3 h). Severe hypobaric hypoxia produced extensive neuronal loss in hippocampal CA1, while the preceding hypoxic preconditioning had clear protective effect on neuronal viability of vulnerable hippocampal cells. Besides, the hypoxic preconditioning prevented impairment of acquisition and retention of PA caused by severe hypoxia. The six-trial hypobaric preconditioning was more effective in protection against PA learning deficits in severe hypoxia exposed rats than the three-trial preconditioning. The preconditioning up-regulated severe hypoxia-suppressed neocortical and hippocampal expression of NGFI-A, suggesting a possible role for NGFI-A in the neuroprotective mechanisms activated by hypoxic preconditioning.","The aim of this work was to study effects of mild preconditioning hypobaric hypoxia (380 Torr for 2 h, repeated 3 or 6 times spaced at 24 h) on brain NGFI-A immunoreactivity and passive avoidance (PA) behavior in rats exposed to severe hypoxia (160 Torr for 3 h).",nan,"Severe hypobaric hypoxia produced extensive neuronal loss in hippocampal CA1, while the preceding hypoxic preconditioning had clear protective effect on neuronal viability of vulnerable hippocampal cells.

"Previous research has shown that post-training intracranial self-stimulation facilitates implicit or procedural memory. To know whether it can also facilitate explicit memory, post-training intracranial self-stimulation was given to Wistar rats immediately after every daily session of a delayed spatial alternation task that seems to depend on the integrity of the hippocampal memory system. We tested the effects of intracranial self-stimulation in three consecutive learning phases which tried to make the task progressively more difficult: 10 s delay (D10 phase), 30 s delay (D30 phase), and inverting the starting position of the animals to make their response more dependent on allocentric cues (INV phase). Every phase finished when each rat achieved a fixed learning criterion. Intracranial self-stimulation facilitated the flexible expression of the learned response (INV phase). That is, when the starting position was randomly inverted, only the rats that received intracranial self-stimulation maintained the performance level acquired in the previous training phases. Changing the starting position reduced the correct performance of the non-treated subjects, which need more training sessions to achieve the learning criterion and made less correct responses than treated rats. These findings show that post-training intracranial self-stimulation can facilitate hippocampus-dependent memories.","Previous research has shown that post-training intracranial self-stimulation facilitates implicit or procedural memory.

"Maternal aggression is a form of aggression towards intruders by lactating females that is critical for defense of offspring. During lactation, fear and anxiety are reduced, the CNS is less responsive to the anxiogenic neuropeptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), and central injections of CRF inhibit maternal aggression. Together, these previous findings suggest that decreased CRF neurotransmission during lactation supports normal maternal aggression expression. Recent work indicates that mice deficient in CRF receptor 2 (CRFR2) display increased anxiety-like behaviors, have a hypersensitive stress response, and overproduce CRF. In this study, we examined both maternal and intermale aggression in wild-type (WT) and CRFR2-deficient mice. CRFR2-mutant mice exhibited significant deficits in maternal aggression on postpartum Day 4 relative to WT mice in terms of percentage displaying aggression, mean number of attacks, and mean time in aggressive encounters. However, time sniffing male intruder, pup retrieval, number of pups, and performance on the elevated plus maze were similar between genotypes. In contrast, intermale aggression did not differ between genotype in any measure on any of three consecutive test days. For neither form of aggression did sites of attacks on the intruder differ between genotype. Taken together, the results suggest that differences in stress sensitivity and the overproduction of CRF of the knockout (KO) mice specifically affects maternal, but not intermale aggression.","Maternal aggression is a form of aggression towards intruders by lactating females that is critical for defense of offspring.

"Hamsters repeatedly exposed to cocaine throughout adolescence display highly escalated offensive aggression compared to saline-treated littermates. The current study investigated whether adolescent cocaine exposure activated neurons in areas of hamster forebrain implicated in aggressive behavior by examining the expression of FOS, i.e., the protein product of the immediate early gene c-fos shown to be a reliably sensitive marker of neuronal activation. Adolescent cocaine-treated hamsters and saline-treated littermates were scored for offensive aggression and then sacrificed 1 day later and examined for the number of FOS immunoreactive (FOS-ir) cells in regions of the hamster forebrain important for aggression control. When compared with non-aggressive, saline-treated controls, aggressive cocaine-treated hamsters showed persistent increases in the number of FOS-ir cells in several aggression regions, including the anterior hypothalamus, nucleus circularis, lateral hypothalamus (i.e., the hypothalamic attack area), lateral septum, and medial and corticomedial amygdaloid nuclei. Conversely, aggressive cocaine-treated hamsters showed a significant decrease in FOS-ir cells in the medial supraoptic nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and central amygdala when compared with controls. However, no differences in FOS-ir cells were found in other areas implicated in aggression such as the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, or in a number of non-aggression areas. These results suggest that adolescent cocaine exposure may constitutively activate neurons in select forebrain areas critical for the regulation of aggression in hamsters. A model for how persistent activation of neurons in one of these brain regions (i.e., the hypothalamus) may facilitate the development of the aggressive phenotype in adolescent cocaine-exposed animals is presented.","Hamsters repeatedly exposed to cocaine throughout adolescence display highly escalated offensive aggression compared to saline-treated littermates.

"We have demonstrated that the atypical antipsychotic drugs prevent cell death in PC12 cells induced by various cytotoxins and have protective effects on methamphetamine-induced neurotoxcity in rats. The present study was designed to examine the possible effects of chronic administration of quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, on the anxiety-like behavioural consequences of a neurotoxic regimen of dl-amphetamine. Rats were treated with quetiapine (10 mg/kg/day; i.p.) for 33 days. During days 15-19 of this period, the animals were given dl-amphetamine (20 mg/kg/day; s.c.) 1 h after the administration of quetiapine. The repeated administration of dl-amphetamine resulted in a decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunostaining in the caudate putamen, hyperthermia, and anxiety-like behavioural changes. The behavioural changes were indicated by a significant increase in the time spent in the light box in the light/dark box test, an increase in the ratios of ambulation distance inside the inner circle over the total ambulation distance and rearings inside the inner circle over the total rearings in the open field test, and an increase in the time spent in open arms in the elevated plus-maze test. Chronic administration of quetiapine significantly attenuated the dl-amphetamine-induced hyperthermia, and the anxiety-like behavioural changes in the light/dark box and in the open field tests. These results suggest that quetiapine can normalize the dl-amphetamine-induced anxiety-like behavioural changes, and might be helpful in the treatment for amphetamine-induced emotional changes.","We have demonstrated that the atypical antipsychotic drugs prevent cell death in PC12 cells induced by various cytotoxins and have protective effects on methamphetamine-induced neurotoxcity in rats.

"The histaminergic system has been speculated to be involved in the inhibitory control of drug reward, H1 and H2 antagonists having been found to potentiate conditioned place preference induced by morphine or cocaine. In contrast, the role of H3 receptors in cocaine-induced place preference is still unknown. The present study tested the effects of thioperamide (0, 10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p.), an H3 autoreceptor antagonist, on the development of a conditioned place preference induced by cocaine (0, 2 and 8 mg/kg, i.p.) in C57BL/6J mice. Thioperamide was injected 10 min before each cocaine-pairing session. The activity scores recorded on the first cocaine-pairing session were also used to test the effects of thioperamide on cocaine-induced locomotor activity. Thioperamide alone had no reinforcing effects and did not affect the conditioned place preference induced by 8 mg/kg cocaine. However, thioperamide dose-dependently revealed a conditioned place preference induced by 2 mg/kg cocaine, a dose that was inactive per se. Finally, thioperamide dose-dependently potentiated the stimulant effects of cocaine, in spite of its slight hypolocomotor effect when given alone. Our results strongly suggest that H3 antagonists potentiate the stimulant and reinforcing effects of cocaine in mice.","The histaminergic system has been speculated to be involved in the inhibitory control of drug reward, H1 and H2 antagonists having been found to potentiate conditioned place preference induced by morphine or cocaine.

"In this study we investigated the functional brain activation during response inhibition by means of concentration changes in oxygenated [O2Hb] and deoxygenated [HHb] hemoglobin. 9 subjects were measured with multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) over the left and right lateral prefrontal cortex. The activation task consisted of three blocks of cued Go-NoGo conditions, which were contrasted with three blocks of cued Go conditions. The Go- and Go-NoGo blocks lasted 30 s each, were presented in alternating order, and were preceded by a 30 s resting period. The results clearly show that both conditions induced a brain activation consisting of significant increases of [O2Hb] and decreases of [HHb]. These effects indicate that an active control condition is necessary for the adequate interpretation of the results. Most importantly, we found significantly higher increases of [O2Hb] and decreases of [HHb] during the inhibition phase as compared to the simple motor response in bilateral inferior frontal regions of the brain, which is in accordance with other brain imaging studies. With the introduction of an active control condition in this study, we improved the methodology of a previous investigation.

"The ""frontal aging hypothesis"" has been proposed by many researchers suggesting that the earliest and most severe age-related changes in the cortex occur in the frontal lobes. Two of these changes include decreases in cognitive functions mediated by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and significant decreases in norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA). To investigate whether the changes in these neurotransmitter systems are directly related to the cognitive decline seen in aging we utilized the rhesus monkey as a model of normal human aging. Our goal was to determine if age-related changes in cognition is associated with changes in norepinephrine and dopamine receptor binding density in the PFC. Eight young monkeys between five and ten years of age (six males and two female) and eight aged monkeys between 25 and 32 years of age (five males and three females) were behaviorally characterized. Subsequently on-the-slide in vitro binding assays were used to quantify the alpha-1 adrenergic, alpha-2 adrenergic and DA1 receptors as well as the NE and DA uptake receptors. Aged animals as a group demonstrated significant cognitive impairments and aging produced a significant decrease in alpha-1 adrenergic and alpha-2 adrenergic receptor binding in the PFC but no significant change in binding for the DA1 receptor or the NE or DA uptake receptors. Further analysis revealed a significant relationship between monoamine receptor binding and cognitive performance on three tasks: delayed non-matching to sample, delayed recognition span test and the conceptual set-shifting task.",The "frontal aging hypothesis" has been proposed by many researchers suggesting that the earliest and most severe age-related changes in the cortex occur in the frontal lobes.

"This paper introduces automated observations in a modular home cage system as a tool to measure the effects of wheel running on the time distribution and daily organization of cage floor locomotor activity in female C57BL/6 mice. Mice (n = 16) were placed in the home cage system for 6 consecutive days. Fifty percent of the subjects had free access to a running wheel that was integrated in the home cage. Overall activity levels in terms of duration of movement were increased by wheel running, while time spent inside a sheltering box was decreased. Wheel running affected the hourly pattern of movement during the animals' active period of the day. Mice without a running wheel, in contrast to mice with a running wheel, showed a clear differentiation between novelty-induced and baseline levels of locomotion as reflected by a decrease after the first day of introduction to the home cage. The results are discussed in the light of the use of running wheels as a tool to measure general activity and as an object for environmental enrichment. Furthermore, the possibilities of using automated home cage observations for e.g. behavioural phenotyping are discussed.",This paper introduces automated observations in a modular home cage system as a tool to measure the effects of wheel running on the time distribution and daily organization of cage floor locomotor activity in female C57BL/6 mice.,Mice (n = 16) were placed in the home cage system for 6 consecutive days.

"This study determined if the hippocampal theta rhythm showed phase relationships or changes in amplitude and frequency with the onset of stimuli and locomotion in a task in which auditory cues initiated and suppressed approach locomotion. Rats with electrodes in the dorsal hippocampus lapped at a milk dipper and were presented a tone which predicted the delivery of a food pellet. In some trials the pellet cue tone was negated by 60-Hz clicks beginning 0.3 s after onset, and no pellet was delivered. A video capture system (20-ms sampling) synchronized to the hippocampal recording system (10-ms sampling) was used to determine the onset of locomotor approach to the pellet area. The findings failed to support proposals that phase-related mechanisms play a role in encoding and retrieval of movement-related information. Neither the pellet cue nor the negating cue reset the theta rhythm, and they did not produce differential evoked potentials. During milk lapping, theta amplitude increased in the 1/2s prior to all pellet cues regardless of their locomotor effect. Frequency also rose but only when a non-negated pellet elicited short-latency locomotion. During locomotor execution, theta peak amplitude peaked earlier than theta frequency by approximately one period. In general during performance of this task, increasing theta amplitude reflected a general preparation to process the cue and increasing theta frequency reflected the readiness to respond to the cue with locomotion.",This study determined if the hippocampal theta rhythm showed phase relationships or changes in amplitude and frequency with the onset of stimuli and locomotion in a task in which auditory cues initiated and suppressed approach locomotion.,"Rats with electrodes in the dorsal hippocampus lapped at a milk dipper and were presented a tone which predicted the delivery of a food pellet.

The present study evaluated the effect of zopiclone, a widely used hypnotic drug, on functional and histological outcome after cortical photothrombosis in aged rats, which might be particularly vulnerable to brain insults and inhibitory sedative-hypnotic drugs. Aged Wistar rats were treated with zopiclone at a dose of 3 mg/kg (i.p., once a day) beginning 4 days before ischemia induction and continuing for 23 days. Sensorimotor recovery was assessed by a new ledged beam-walking test and spatial learning by the Morris water-maze. After a 7-day washout period all rats were administered a single dose of zopiclone (3 mg/kg, i.p.) and retested. Infarct volumes were measured from nitroblue tetrazolium-stained sections at the end of the experiment. Beam-walking data showed that ischemic rats treated with zopiclone were not more impaired than untreated rats. Indeed, they showed fewer faults with the impaired hindlimb than ischemic controls on post-operative day 16. Water-maze performance was not affected by zopiclone. After the washout period a single dose of zopiclone did not worsen forelimb or hindlimb function, but seemed to improve performance in the water-maze test. Cortical infarct volumes were similar in ischemic controls and ischemic rats treated with zopiclone. In conclusion, zopiclone was not detrimental and even seemed to improve behavioral outcome without affecting ischemic damage in aged rats subjected to cortical photothrombosis.","Sedative-hypnotic drugs commonly used in the elderly may affect functional recovery following cerebrovascular events.

"Current neurosurgical strategies target overactive brain regions including the subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus and thalamus to control various symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Subthalamotomy improves akinesia and can induce postural deficits in both parkinsonian humans and animals, pallidotomy improves limb dyskinesia and more variably, distal bradykinesia whilst thalamotomy improves tremor. Because the SNr also becomes overactive in PD and there are few surgical studies in parkinsonian primates, we therefore evaluated the effects of lesioning the SNr in hemiparkinsonian marmosets to establish the effects on symptomatology. Nine monkeys received unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions. Seven weeks later, four received kainic acid lesions of the SNr. Behavioural tests were performed prior to 6-OHDA surgery and then fortnightly for 14 weeks. Unilateral 6-OHDA lesions induced ipsilateral postural bias, ipsilateral rotation after amphetamine injection and bradykinesia. Whilst, SNr lesions significantly altered the direction of head position and amphetamine-induced rotation relative to 6-OHDA lesions, there was no improvement in 6-OHDA-induced reaching deficits or sensorimotor neglect. Unbiased quantitation of the nigral lesions showed on average 88% loss of dopaminergic neurons after 6-OHDA lesions and 77% loss of non-dopaminergic neurons after SNr lesions. Our results demonstrate that the SNr is important in body orientation changes in parkinsonism.","Current neurosurgical strategies target overactive brain regions including the subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus and thalamus to control various symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

"Opioid systems are implicated in social attachment processes. This research sought to determine the functional contribution of each opioid receptor in modulating social attachment/separation distress. Following ICV administration of opiate probes, 7-day-old cockerels were isolated from conspecifics for a 3 min test period under either a mirror or no-mirror condition. Vocalizations served as the measure of separation-stress. Opioid receptor probes included: the mu agonist DAMGO (0.02, 0.19, 1.95 nmol), the mu antagonist CTOP (0.009, 0.09, 0.9 nmol), the delta agonist SNC80 (0.3, 1.0, 3.0 micromol), the delta antagonist naltrindole (0.2, 2.2, 22.2 nmol), the kappa agonist U50, 488 (1, 30, 100 nmol), the kappa antagonist norBNI (1.3, 13.6, 136.1 nmol), the NOP agonist N/OFQ (0.01, 0.1, 1.0 nmol), and the NOP antagonist UFP-101 (0.1, 1.0, 10.0 nmol). DAMGO attenuated separation distress vocalizations. No other drug probe enhanced or attenuated distress vocalizations. Further, the non-selective opiate antagonist naloxone (0.3, 8.3, 27.5 nmol) did not exacerbate distress vocalizations. These results suggest that only the mu receptor modulates social attachment in young domestic fowl.",Opioid systems are implicated in social attachment processes.

"There is ample evidence that plastic changes in the nervous system require the excitatory amino acid transmission. This appears to be also the case for psychostimulant-induced behavioral sensitization. More specifically the glutamatergic input from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to the VTA and the NAc appears to be involved in behavioral sensitization processes. However, dissociations regarding the role of the mPFC with respect to the development and expression of sensitization, as well as with respect to the psychostimulant being studied (amphetamine versus cocaine) appear to exist. The present study examined the role of the dorsal mPFC in the development and expression of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-induced sensitization. Bilateral ibotenic acid or sham lesions of the dorsal mPFC were performed 7 days prior to or 4 days after a context-dependent sensitization-inducing regimen of MDMA (15 mg/kg i.p.) or saline. Rats were then challenged with MDMA (5 mg/kg i.p.) after 12 days of withdrawal. Ibotenic acid lesions did not affect the activating effects of MDMA, but prevented the development and expression of MDMA sensitization. Thus, the distance traveled during the development phase of sensitization increased in sham-lesioned rats but not in ibotenic-lesioned animals. Similarly, sham-lesioned rats showed a sensitized response when challenged with MDMA after the withdrawal period, an effect not observed in ibotenic-lesioned animals. These data reinforce the view that the dorsal mPFC is involved in psychostimulant sensitization and more specifically they indicate that the dorsal mPFC plays a key role in the development and expression of MDMA-induced behavioral sensitization.","There is ample evidence that plastic changes in the nervous system require the excitatory amino acid transmission.

"The effects of multiple-site, intradentate, colchicine injections on the performance of a temporal, 'differential reinforcement of low rates of responding' (DRL-20s) task and a spatial, 'delayed non-matching-to-place' (DNMTP) task in a plus-maze were investigated in rats trained in both tasks prior to the lesion. Quantitative analysis revealed a greater than 86% reduction in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the colchicine-injected rats compared to the sham-operated controls. Dentate gyrus damage rendered rats less efficient than sham-operated controls in the performance of the DRL-20s task. The DRL inter-response time (IRT) distribution for the DG-lesioned rats and the sham-operated controls was similar; however, while the distribution peak for the control rats was 20s, it was 16s for the DG-lesioned rats, indicating that the latter rats underestimated time. Performance of the DG-lesioned rats was also disrupted in the DNMTP task. However, DG-lesioned rats recovered control levels of performance during repeated training with an intertrial interval equal to 3s. An increase in intertrial interval in lesioned and sham-operated controls disrupted performance in both groups; however, while DG-lesioned rats performed at chance levels when the intertrial interval was increased to 4min or longer, the sham-operated controls performed at chance levels only when the intertrial interval was increased to 16min.

"The nucleus accumbens (n. acc.) has been implicated in conditioning to both discrete and contextual cues but its precise role is as yet controversial because conflicting patterns of effect have been reported. These inconsistencies may relate to the extent to which the lesions used encroach on different subfields of n. acc. and the use of different task variants. The present study compared the effects of selective lesions of shell and core subfields of nucleus accumbens (n. acc.) across aversive and appetitive trace conditioning variants. In both experiments, an auditory stimulus was contiguous with footshock or food, or presented at a trace interval. A continuous flashing light in each case provided an experimental background stimulus. Conditioning to the cues provided by the experimental chambers was also assessed. Rats with electrolytic lesions to the n. acc. shell and core showed different patterns of effect in aversive (Experiment 1) and appetitive (Experiment 2) variants of this procedure. In Experiment 1, the core lesion reduced the difference between trace and contiguously conditioned groups, in responding to the discrete noise stimulus. However, neither lesion had any detectable effect on contextual conditioning. In Experiment 2, the shell lesion clearly increased contextual conditioning, selectively in the trace conditioned group, but neither lesion had any detectable effect on discrete cue conditioning. Thus, whilst the shell and core lesions produced dissociable effects on discrete cue and contextual conditioning, the conclusions to be drawn depend on the procedural variant in use.",The nucleus accumbens (n. acc.) has been implicated in conditioning to both discrete and contextual cues but its precise role is as yet controversial because conflicting patterns of effect have been reported.

"The magnitude of an acoustic startle response can be reduced by a weak stimulus presented immediately before the startle-eliciting noise. This phenomenon has been termed prepulse inhibition of the startle reaction (PPI). Previous studies indicated that the primary neural pathways mediating PPI belong to the brain stem and that the inferior colliculus (IC) was crucial. Its destruction reduced PPI. Stimulations applied to brain areas may be as deleterious as lesions. Therefore, we looked for the possibility of a brain stimulation applied to the IC during a PPI test to reduce also PPI. Rats were implanted with chronic electrodes, their tips being aimed at the IC. They were located within or close to the inter-colliculus nucleus. A train of stimulations was applied and PPI was tested alternately during and between periods of stimulation. As the most common method used to attenuate PPI consists in administrating drugs, for example ketamine, we also tested the effect of this drug. Another drug was also tested, diazepam, since it alters the functioning of the IC without any known effect on PPI. This allowed a comparative analysis of the neurobiological and the pharmacological effects. It appeared that the stimulation decreased PPI quantitatively as much as ketamine (6 mg/kg) without an effect of the basic startle reaction. These effects did not interfere with each other. Diazepam (1 mg/kg) did not modify PPI, neither under stimulation nor per se. Only for a very high dose (4 mg/kg), a sedative and myo-relaxant one the basic startle and PPI were altered.","The magnitude of an acoustic startle response can be reduced by a weak stimulus presented immediately before the startle-eliciting noise.

"Recent results suggest that a negative ERP potential emerges not only on error trials, but is also found after correct responses. There is broad evidence that this component is generated in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The present study aimed to explore the influence of working memory demands on the evaluation process probably reflected by the negative potential. To this purpose, a modified continuous performance task (CPT) was used, with variations of the delay between cues and imperative stimuli. Data were analyzed using conventional averaging techniques as well as source localization with LORETA (low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography). Results suggest a significant effect of working memory delay on the amplitude of the post-response negative ERP component. Its source was located in the anterior cingulate cortex, with the exact location being dependent upon working memory demands. The results support the notion of a general response evaluation system reflected by a post-response negative component. The findings of a working memory dependent modification of this potential suggest a functional link between the medial frontal cortex and the lateral frontal regions primarily involved in working memory processing.","Recent results suggest that a negative ERP potential emerges not only on error trials, but is also found after correct responses.

"Weight gain and sexual dysfunction are serious side effects of certain antipsychotic drugs. Ziprasidone, a novel antipsychotic with a unique receptor binding profile, is reported to have a low propensity for such side effects. Previous results from this laboratory have demonstrated substantial weight gain following sub-chronic treatment with olanzapine and risperidone. Risperidone induced weight gain and markedly impaired reproductive function while olanzapine induced weight gain, without affecting reproductive function. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of ziprasidone on weight gain and reproductive function in female rats. Ziprasidone (1 and 2.5 mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle was administered once daily for 28 days and body weight, food and water intake measured, in addition to histological examination of vaginal lavage to determine the stage of the oestrous cycle. On day 28, the rats were sacrificed and the uterine weights recorded, intra-abdominal fat weight and plasma prolactin levels measured. Ziprasidone failed to induce significant weight gain during weeks 1-3, however, significant weight gain was observed on day 28 at 2.5 mg/kg (p &lt; 0.05).

"Permanent, 3-stage, 4-vessel occlusion (4-VO) was evaluated as a practicable model of progressive, cerebral hypoperfusion in rats, resulting in quantifiable, reproducible, neuronal damage within a time interval shorter than that described in the 2-VO model. The effect of permanent and graded 4-VO on cognition was also evaluated using the newly developed, aversive radial maze. The vertebral arteries (VA) plus the common carotid arteries (CCA) or internal carotid arteries (ICA) were progressively and permanently occluded, following different experimental sequences (CCA--&gt; VA; VA--&gt;CCA--&gt;CCA or VA--&gt;ICA--&gt;ICA) with inter-stage intervals ranging from 1 to 4 weeks. Only two of four groups subjected to 2-stage 4-VO (CCA--&gt;VA) showed modest reduction in the number of normal-appearing CA1 pyramidal cells, despite the significant treatment effect (p &lt; 0.001-0.01 versus sham). A high rate of mortality (63.8%) was associated with 2-stage 4-VO. More pronounced and consistent neuronal damage occurred 8 weeks after 3-stage 4-VO, following the sequence VA --&gt; CCA --&gt; CCA (p &lt; 0.001). One month after this schedule, profound, persistent cognitive impairment was demonstrated in the aversive radial maze (p &lt; 0.01-0.0001). This behavioral effect was not manifested when the ICA, rather than the CCA, were occluded, despite the presence of significant, although less severe, hippocampal lesioning. The mortality rate was significantly reduced when 3-stage 4-VO was used (p &lt; 0.0001). These consistent, histological and behavioral effects, combined with a low mortality rate, suggest that permanent, 3-stage 4-VO may represent a reliable animal model of chronic, progressive, cerebral hypoperfusion.","Permanent, 3-stage, 4-vessel occlusion (4-VO) was evaluated as a practicable model of progressive, cerebral hypoperfusion in rats, resulting in quantifiable, reproducible, neuronal damage within a time interval shorter than that described in the 2-VO model.

A high rate of mortality (63.8%) was associated with 2-stage 4-VO.","More pronounced and consistent neuronal damage occurred 8 weeks after 3-stage 4-VO, following the sequence VA --&gt; CCA --&gt; CCA (p &lt; 0.001). One month after this schedule, profound, persistent cognitive impairment was demonstrated in the aversive radial maze (p &lt; 0.01-0.0001). This behavioral effect was not manifested when the ICA, rather than the CCA, were occluded, despite the presence of significant, although less severe, hippocampal lesioning. The mortality rate was significantly reduced when 3-stage 4-VO was used (p &lt; 0.0001). These consistent, histological and behavioral effects, combined with a low mortality rate, suggest that permanent, 3-stage 4-VO may represent a reliable animal model of chronic, progressive, cerebral hypoperfusion.",1,1,1,"More pronounced and consistent neuronal damage occurred 8 weeks after 3-stage 4-VO, following the sequence VA --&gt; CCA --&gt; CCA (p &lt; 0.001).

"Patients with Alzheimer's disease suffer from progressive cognitive impairments and show distinct post-mortem neuropathology, including beta-amyloid plaques. Transgenic (Tg) CRND8 mice carry a mutated human amyloid precursor protein gene and show age-related increases in beta-amyloid production and plaque deposition. It was previously reported that during the early stages of plaque deposition, Tg CRND8 mice demonstrated Morris maze impairments. However, it is unknown if Tg mice would be impaired at an earlier age prior to plaque deposition or more impaired at a later age with more extensive plaque deposition. In the current study, we describe Tg CRND8 age-progressing beta-amyloid neuropathology and cognitive abilities in greater detail. At all ages, Tg mice showed normal short-term memory in the Y-maze. Pre-plaque Tg and age-matched Non-Tg mice did not differ in learning the spatial Morris water maze. However, both early and late plaque Tg mice showed impairments during acquisition. In addition, although early plaque Tg mice performed well in the probe trial, late plaque Tg mice demonstrated impaired probe trial performance. Therefore compared to their Non-Tg littermates, Tg CRND8 mice demonstrate cognitive impairments that progressed with age and seemed to coincide with the onset of beta-amyloid plaque deposition.","Patients with Alzheimer's disease suffer from progressive cognitive impairments and show distinct post-mortem neuropathology, including beta-amyloid plaques.

"Numerous studies have evaluated the sleep homeostasis of rats after short- or long-periods of sleep deprivation, but none has assessed the effects of prolonged sleep restriction on the rat's sleep pattern. The purpose of the present study, therefore, was to evaluate the sleep homeostasis of rats under a protocol of chronic sleep restriction. Male Wistar rats were implanted with electrodes for EEG and EMG recordings. Using the single platform method, the animals were submitted to 18 h of sleep restriction, beginning at 16:00 h (lights on at 07:00 h), followed by a 6 h sleep window (from 10:00 h to 16:00 h) for 21 days. Immediately after this period, rats were allowed to sleep freely for 4 days (recovery period). The sleep-wake cycle was recorded throughout the entire experiment and the results showed that during the 6h sleep window there was an increase on the percentage of sleep time, reflected by augmented time in high amplitude slow wave sleep and in paradoxical sleep, when compared to baseline sleep, whereas bouts of awakening longer than 1.5 min were greatly reduced, with the animals exhibiting a monophasic-type sleep pattern. During the deprivation period, paradoxical sleep was abolished. High amplitude slow wave sleep was also greatly affected by the protocol. Nonetheless, one day of recovery was sufficient to restore the normal sleep pattern. These findings indicate that this protocol was capable to induce many changes in the rat's sleep patterns, suggesting that during the 6h sleep window there is a sleep adaptive homeostatic process.","Numerous studies have evaluated the sleep homeostasis of rats after short- or long-periods of sleep deprivation, but none has assessed the effects of prolonged sleep restriction on the rat's sleep pattern.

"(-)-3-Acetyl-6beta-acetylthio-N-cyclopropylmethyl-normorphine (KT-90) is a synthesized compound that binds to mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptors in vitro. KT-90 induces analgesia in the tail-flick test and this effect is antagonized by nor-BNI, a selective kappa-opioid receptor antagonist. However, lower doses of KT-90 antagonize morphine-induced analgesia. We reported that kappa-opioid receptor agonists such as U-50,488H and dynorphin A (1-13), improved scopolamine-induced impairment of learning and memory in mice and/or rats. In this study, the effects of KT-90 were investigated in an acetic acid-induced writhing test and scopolamine-induced memory impairment test using spontaneous alternation performance in a Y-maze. Male ddY mice were treated with scopolamine (1.65 micromol/kg, s.c.) 30 min before the behavioral test. KT-90 (0.07-2.35 micromol/kg, s.c.) was injected 30 min before testing. In the writhing test, the antinociceptive effect of KT-90 (0.71 micromol/kg) was completely antagonized by a selective mu-opioid receptor antagonist, beta-funaltrexamine (10.2 nmol/mouse, i.c.v.) and partially antagonized by nor-BNI (4.9 nmol/mouse, i.c.v.), but it was not antagonized by a selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist, naltrindole (9.1 pmol/mouse, i.c.v.). KT-90 significantly improved the impairment of spontaneous alternation induced by scopolamine. The ameliorating effect of KT-90 was not antagonized by nor-BNI, but was almost completely antagonized by a selective sigma receptor antagonist, NE-100 (2.6 micromol/kg, i.p.). These results suggested that the KT-90-induced antinociceptive effect was mediated by mu- and partially by kappa-opioid receptors, and the KT-90-induced improvement in scopolamine-induced impairment of spontaneous alternation was mediated mainly via sigma receptors.","(-)-3-Acetyl-6beta-acetylthio-N-cyclopropylmethyl-normorphine (KT-90) is a synthesized compound that binds to mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptors in vitro.

"In rats, individual differences in vulnerability to self-administration of drugs of abuse can be predicted by individual locomotor responses to a novel environment. This phenomenon has been well described for male rats, however very little information is available with regard to female rats and the added complication of estrous cycle hormone changes influencing activity levels. This study was designed to explore the relationship between individual responsiveness to exposure to a novel environment, the estrous cycle, and the response to cocaine in intact, cycling female rats. Locomotor activity of naive female rats was measured upon exposure to a novel environment followed by determination of estrous cycle stage and level of circulating estradiol. Rats were identified as high-responder (HR; 15% most active) or low-responder (LR; 15% least active) rats based on the locomotor response. Hyperactivity in response to cocaine was greater in HR than in LR rats. These data in combination with evaluation of the stage of estrous suggest that the estrous cycle interacts with individual phenotypic characteristics to modify the sensitivity to cocaine in female animals.","In rats, individual differences in vulnerability to self-administration of drugs of abuse can be predicted by individual locomotor responses to a novel environment.

"Chronic mild stress (CMS) has been reported to induce an anhedonic-like state in rats that resembles some of the symptoms of endogenous depression in humans. In the present study, CMS-induced behavioural responses along with neurochemical alterations in dopaminergic and serotonergic function in prefrontal cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and hippocampus were examined following treatment with imipramine in Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats. The CMS procedure lasted 7 weeks in total. Once per week, a 1-h preference test for 1% sucrose solution was conducted. Treatment with imipramine (10mg/kg i.p., once daily) commenced after experimental week 3. CMS induced significant reductions in absolute and relative sucrose intake and sucrose preference in both rat strains but their temporal pattern was different especially during the weeks 0-3. These effects were reversed by IMI. An increase in the dopaminergic and a decrease in the serotonergic activity were observed in the prefrontal cortex in both rat strains following CMS. A decrease in the striatal dopaminergic activity and an increased hippocampal serotonergic activity were also seen in both rat strains following CMS. In Wistar rats, dopaminergic and serotonergic activities were enhanced in the hypothalamus whereas in Sprague-Dawley rats no such stress-induced changes were observed. Notably, the clear decrease in sucrose consumption observed in stressed Wistar rats could be directly associated with a respective increase in the dopaminergic hypothalamic activity. Chronic treatment with imipramine normalized all neurochemical alterations induced by CMS. Our results suggest that a specific and regionally differentiated serotonin-dopamine interaction is directly related to the observed stress-induced anhedonia.",Chronic mild stress (CMS) has been reported to induce an anhedonic-like state in rats that resembles some of the symptoms of endogenous depression in humans.,"In the present study, CMS-induced behavioural responses along with neurochemical alterations in dopaminergic and serotonergic function in prefrontal cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and hippocampus were examined following treatment with imipramine in Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats.

"The serotonergic system is well known for its aggression lowering effects. It has been shown repeatedly, however, that the serotonergic system is activated during fights, and recent data suggested that it is necessary for the expression of aggressive behavior. We investigated the interaction between serotonergic activation and aggressive behavior by assessing the co-localization of the c-Fos signal (marker of neuronal activation) with tryptophan-hydroxylase activity (marker of serotonin secretion) in the raphe. Control rats were compared with rats exposed to visual and olfactory (but not physical) contacts with opponents (psychosocial stimulation) as well as with rats exposed to aggressive encounters. Fights were accompanied by the activation of the raphe; however, the effect was not aggression-specific, as a similar activation was induced by psychosocial contacts. The lack of behavioral specificity in activation suggests that it was related to social arousal rather than to the execution of fights. The activation of serotonergic raphe neurons showed a negative correlation with aggressive behavior, which is in line with the widespread view that serotonin neurotransmission downregulates aggressive behavior. The activation of serotonergic neurons did not show a correlation with measures of hypoarousal-driven abnormal aggression, which indicates that factors other than the raphe control this behavior. The latter finding may explain the low efficacy of serotonergic treatments in conduct and antisocial personality disorders, in which violence correlates with hypoarousal.","The serotonergic system is well known for its aggression lowering effects.

"It is known that the right and left brain hemispheres differ in their ability to regulate autonomic processes in the organism. Direct unilateral stimulation of the brain provokes side-dependent endocrine, immune and other visceral reactions. Since brain hemispheres are mainly involved in the regulation of muscles and sensory organs on the contra lateral side of the body the activation of behavioural asymmetry stimulates the contra lateral half of the brain. The important theoretical and practical question of whether autonomic processes can be regulated via the behavioural asymmetry route remains unexplored. In this study, we report that the chronic presentation of an emotionally important stimulus-food-from the left side, improves reproductive performance in animals in a broad range of feeding conditions. The unilateral presentation of food can also influence lactation, but in this case the side-dependent effects are different under varying feeding conditions. This finding opens a simple practical approach to influence basic somatic functions in the organism.","It is known that the right and left brain hemispheres differ in their ability to regulate autonomic processes in the organism.

"Latent inhibition (LI) is a behavioural procedure used to evaluate the potential propsychotic and antipsychotic properties of psychoactive drugs. In the present study, a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) procedure was used to investigate the effects of the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), and the psychotomimetic drugs, phencyclidine (PCP) and d-amphetamine (d-AMP) on LI. PCP (2 mg/kg) and d-AMP (0.5 mg/kg) were both found to enhance LI in this procedure. The effect of d-AMP on LI was less pronounced and this drug also caused a weak disruption of taste aversion conditioning.

"The observation of actions can lead, in some cases, to the repetition of those same actions. In other words, motor programs similar to those observed can be recruited. Since this phenomenon is expressed when in the presence of another individual, it has been named social facilitation. In the present study we investigated whether the observation and/or hearing of eating actions facilitate eating behaviors in observing/listening pig-tailed macaques. In experiment 1, the observation of an eating room mate significantly enhanced eating behavior in the observer. Similar results were obtained (experiment 2) in response to the sound of eating actions but not to control sounds (experiment 3). We propose that eating facilitation triggered by observation or listening of eating actions can rely on the mirror neuron system of ventral premotor cortex that provides a matching between the observed/listened action and the executed action. This matching system can subsequently trigger the motor programs necessary for repeating the observed/heard actions.","The observation of actions can lead, in some cases, to the repetition of those same actions.

"Determining the behavioural phenotype of genetically altered mice is a valuable approach for elucidating the function of genes and their role in cognitive disorders. Methods for phenotyping newborn mice are scarce and generally confined to sensorimotor reflexes. Here, we describe a simple method for assessing associative abilities in newborn mice. We used a two-odour-choice classical conditioning paradigm in mice from the day of birth (post-natal age 0, P0) to P6. Acquisition required 20 trials: 10 trials during which the pups were placed over the conditioned stimulus (CS+) odour (lemon or peppermint) for 30s and simultaneously stroked gently with a paintbrush and 10 trials during which the pups were placed over the other odour (CS-) for 30s, without stroking. Then, the pups were subjected to five odour-preference trials to test for conditioning. This sequence of five trials was repeated after 5 and 24h to assess retention of the conditioned odour preference. During the immediate post-acquisition sequence, the pups spent significantly more time over the CS+ than over the CS- (p&lt;0.0001). No extinction of the conditioned preference was observed during this test. No preference was observed after 5 or 24h, indicating that the conditioned response was promptly lost. Conditioning was effective as soon as P0-P1. Thus, conditioning may emerge in newborn mice sooner than previously reported. This paradigm is well suited to phenotyping of large samples of genetically altered mice and may shed light on the role for genes in paediatric cognitive impairments.",Determining the behavioural phenotype of genetically altered mice is a valuable approach for elucidating the function of genes and their role in cognitive disorders.

"Conditioned reinforcement is hypothesized to be critically involved in drug addiction as a factor contributing to compulsive drug use and relapse. The present study focused on the neurobiology involved in the acquisition and expression of conditioned reinforcing effects of morphine withdrawal employing a conditioned place aversion (CPA) paradigm in acute-dependent rats. Expression of c-Fos in the amygdala (the central nucleus, CeA; the medial nucleus, MeA; the basolateral nucleus, BLA) following naloxone-precipitated withdrawal and the CPA test was examined using a range of naloxone doses (0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg). Naloxone dose-dependently produced CPA in rats given a single morphine exposure. In CeA, but not MeA with high-level constitutive neuronal activity, the naloxone-induced modification in c-Fos immunoreactivity following morphine pretreatment exhibited a dose-dependent pattern similar to that seen in the behavioral study. On the other hand, none of the three amygdaloid nuclei examined including CeA, MeA and BLA showed notable sensitivity of c-Fos to the conditioned withdrawal stimulus. These results suggest that CeA may play a role in the negative affective aspect of withdrawal from acute dependence, and in part suggest that the acquisition and expression of CPA may involve different neurobiological mechanisms.",Conditioned reinforcement is hypothesized to be critically involved in drug addiction as a factor contributing to compulsive drug use and relapse.

"We tested the hypothesis that neuropeptide Y (NPY) interacts with cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) in inhibition of intake of an intraorally infused solution of sucrose, a test of consummatory ingestive behavior. Both intracerebroventricular infusion of NPY (10 microg) and intraperitoneal injection of CCK-8 (0.5 micro/kg) reduced the intake of a 1M solution of sucrose infused intraorally at a rate of 0.5 ml/min in ovariectomized female rats, but the two peptides did not interact in inhibiting intraoral intake. By contrast, NPY increased intake if the sucrose solution was ingested from a bottle, a test demanding both appetitive and consummatory ingestive responses. CCK-8 inhibited intake in this test and its inhibitory effect was increased by simultaneous treatment with NPY. The activity in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), a brainstem relay mediating inhibition of intake, judged by the expression of c-fos-like immunoreactivity, was significantly increased after treatment with CCK-8 or NPY to approximately the same extent. Combined treatment with NPY and CCK-8 did not increase the c-fos-like immunoreactivity in the NTS above treatment with NPY or CCK-8 alone. These results strengthen the hypothesis that NPY, like CCK-8, is an inhibitor of consummatory ingestive behavior and suggest that this inhibition is mediated via the NTS.","We tested the hypothesis that neuropeptide Y (NPY) interacts with cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) in inhibition of intake of an intraorally infused solution of sucrose, a test of consummatory ingestive behavior.","Both intracerebroventricular infusion of NPY (10 microg) and intraperitoneal injection of CCK-8 (0.5 micro/kg) reduced the intake of a 1M solution of sucrose infused intraorally at a rate of 0.5 ml/min in ovariectomized female rats, but the two peptides did not interact in inhibiting intraoral intake.

"Repetitive exposure to psychostimulants elicits behavioral sensitization. Accumulating evidence have shown that the central GABAergic system is involved in psychostimulants sensitization. Valproate, a clinically widely used anticonvulsant mood-stabilizing agent, can modulate central GABAergic neurotransmission. Herein, the effects of valproate on the development and expression of behavioral sensitization to methamphetamine (METH) and cocaine was studied in mice. Behavioral sensitization of METH and cocaine was rendered by injection of METH (2.0mg/kg) or cocaine (20mg/kg) once daily for seven days. Locomotor activity was measured by an ambulometer. Single or multiple administration of valproate (37.5, 75, 150 mg/kg) could not decrease acute METH- and cocaine-induced hyperactivity. Co-administration of valproate with METH or cocaine dose-dependently inhibited the development of behavioral sensitization. Single administration of valproate (37.5, 75, 150 mg/kg) did not affect the expression of behavioral sensitization induced by METH and cocaine. Multiple administration of valproate (37.5, 75, 150 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited the expression of behavioral sensitization to METH, but not to cocaine. The present results supported that METH- and cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization possesses distinct neural mechanisms, which implies that valproate may have different modulatory effect on METH and cocaine addiction in humans.","Repetitive exposure to psychostimulants elicits behavioral sensitization.

"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) have opposing effects on stress-associated and consummatory behaviors in rodents. Recent studies also suggest that both peptides influence ethanol intake. In the present study, the effects of administration of CRF and NPY into the lateral ventricle on ethanol intake in naive and ethanol-vapor-exposed Wistar rats were examined. A limited access paradigm was used to measure intake of a 10% (v/v) ethanol solution in Wistar rats trained to drink using a sucrose fading procedure. Ethanol vapor exposure for 8 weeks significantly elevated ethanol intake in this limited access paradigm relative to pre-exposure levels. The effects of icv administration of CRF (1 microg), NPY (10 microg) or NPY/CRF combined (10 and 1 microg, respectively) on ethanol intake were then assessed. In non-vapor-exposed subjects, icv infusion of NPY had no effect on ethanol intake, while a significant suppression of drinking was seen following icv administration of CRF. Administration of NPY in combination with CRF had no effect on ethanol intake in non-ethanol-vapor-exposed rats. In vapor-exposed subjects, both NPY and CRF reduced ethanol intake, but when given in combination, no difference from vehicle was detected. Locomotor activity was measured during drinking sessions and was unaffected by peptide administration. These studies underscore the importance of a history of exposure to chronic ethanol vapor in the regulation of ethanol intake by NPY. Furthermore, the results presented here suggest that a balance between the stress-related peptides NPY and CRF may be involved in the regulation of ethanol intake.",Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) have opposing effects on stress-associated and consummatory behaviors in rodents.

"In order to elucidate the relationship between maternal behavior and depression, the Flinders sensitive line (FSL) model of depression was studied and compared to Sprague-Dawley (SD) controls. Immobility in the swim test was measured, as an index for depressive-like behavior, and frequencies of maternal and non-maternal behaviors were recorded using short un-intrusive observations in the home cage. Lactating FSL rats displayed higher levels of immobility in the swim test compared to controls, indicating depressive-like behavior. In addition, compared to SD rats, FSL dams showed less frequent pup licking and non-nutritive contact with pups during the first and third weeks of lactation. In the third postpartum week, FSL dams showed less frequent nursing postures and more frequent self-directed behaviors. Thus, lactating FSL dams exhibit both depressed-like behavior and some abnormalities in maternal behavior.","In order to elucidate the relationship between maternal behavior and depression, the Flinders sensitive line (FSL) model of depression was studied and compared to Sprague-Dawley (SD) controls.","Immobility in the swim test was measured, as an index for depressive-like behavior, and frequencies of maternal and non-maternal behaviors were recorded using short un-intrusive observations in the home cage.","Lactating FSL rats displayed higher levels of immobility in the swim test compared to controls, indicating depressive-like behavior.

"Although many studies have investigated the function of cellular prion protein (PrPc), its physiologic role remains elusive. PrPc null mice have been reported to develop normally and to show normal performance in most behavioural tests. In the present study we investigated whether this also holds true after episodes of acute stress. PrPc gene ablated (Prnp0/0) and wild-type mice were subjected to restraint stress, electric foot shock, or swimming and compared with non-stressed animals. Immediately after the stressful situation, the anxiety levels and locomotion of the animals were measured using plus-maze and open-field tests. Among non-stressed animals, there was no significant difference in performance between Prnp0/0 and wild type animals in either test. However, after acute stress provoked by a foot shock or a swimming trial, Prnp0/0 animals showed a significant decrease in anxiety levels when compared with control animals. Moreover, after the swimming test, knockout mice presented decreased locomotion when compared to wild-type mice. Because of this observation, we also assessed both types of mice in a forced swimming test with the objective of better evaluating muscle function and found that Prnp0/0 animals presented reduced forced swimming capacity when compared to controls. As far as we know, this is the first report suggesting that cellular prion protein is involved in modulation of anxiety or muscular activity after acute psychic or physical stress.","Although many studies have investigated the function of cellular prion protein (PrPc), its physiologic role remains elusive.

"This study was based on the higher prevalence of anxiety disorders in women than in men, and on the finding that early adverse experiences are a major risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders later in life. The object of this study was to investigate in rats, the sensitivities of the light-enhanced startle (LES) and fear-potentiated startle (FPS) paradigms to sex differences and to determine the effects of maternal separation (MS) on the baseline startle magnitude and potentiated startle response in these paradigms. Pups in the MS group were separated daily from their mother for 180 min/day from postnatal day 2 (PND2) to PND14. Control litters remained undisturbed. The adult male and female progeny were tested in the FPS and LES. As predicted, females showed a significantly greater potentiation of startle than males in the FPS, and a strong trend towards greater startle potentiation in the LES. Contrary to predictions, MS had no effect on startle potentiation in the FPS and severely disrupted LES in female, but not male rats. The observed sex differences add to the validity of the FPS and LES as animal paradigms of fear and anxiety. The findings indicate that these paradigms can be used to study the biological basis of sex differences in fear and anxiety. In contrast, the effects of MS on startle potentiation argue against the idea that MS provides a robust model for the predicted influences of early adverse effects on these startle potentiation measures of fear and anxiety.","This study was based on the higher prevalence of anxiety disorders in women than in men, and on the finding that early adverse experiences are a major risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders later in life.","The object of this study was to investigate in rats, the sensitivities of the light-enhanced startle (LES) and fear-potentiated startle (FPS) paradigms to sex differences and to determine the effects of maternal separation (MS) on the baseline startle magnitude and potentiated startle response in these paradigms.

"Aberrant social behavior is a hallmark of many cognitive, mood, and neurological disorders, although the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the behavioral deficits are not well understood. The neurotransmitter noradrenaline (NA) has been implicated in some of these disorders, as well as in several aspects of social behavior in humans and animals. We tested dopamine beta-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh -/-) mice that lack NA in various social behavior paradigms. Dbh -/- mice have relatively normal performance in the elevated plus maze, light/dark box, and open field test - three measures of anxiety - and a social recognition test. In contrast, Dbh -/- mice displayed a specific deficit in a social discrimination task and had a nearly complete absence of resident-intruder aggression. These results indicate that intact NA signaling is required for some types of social memory and aggression, but that a lack of NA does not greatly affect anxiety in mice. Further exploration of NA deficits in neurological disease may reveal mechanisms of aberrant social behavior.","Aberrant social behavior is a hallmark of many cognitive, mood, and neurological disorders, although the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the behavioral deficits are not well understood.

"One of the earliest signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is loss of memory for recent events. This deficit in short term memory has been characterised in mild/moderate AD patients as a delay-dependent deficit in a delayed matching to sample (DMTS) task. PS2APP mice co-expressing hPS2mut and hAPPswe exhibit a spatial-temporal elevation in brain amyloid deposition and inflammation associated with temporal cognitive decline. The aim of the current study was to train PS2APP mice (C57BL/6JxDBA/2 mixed background) and appropriate control mice (B6D2F1 background) in a rodent delayed response task, the delayed matching to position (DMTP) task, prior to the onset of plaque formation and subsequently at 2-4 monthly intervals to investigate the effect of aging and increasing plaque load on DMTP performance. At 5 months of age (baseline) DMTP performance was equivalent with both PS2APP and control mice demonstrating a working memory curve across increasing delay intervals of 1-24s. A comparison of PS2APP and control mice across ages revealed a selective age-related, delay-dependent, impairment on choice accuracy in PS2APP mice, consistent with the cognitive decline and temporal amyloidosis previously described for this mouse model. These data are also relevant for other conditional transgenic mouse models which allow time-sensitive induction or inhibition of gene expression such that mice can be trained to perform the task prior to activation or inactivation of the gene and tested thereafter.",One of the earliest signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is loss of memory for recent events.

"Generalization is a fundamental cognitive ability that allows treating similar stimuli as equivalents, and thus responding to them in the same manner. Here, we show that after training free-flying bees with a single, constant pair of patterns made of four quadrants, each displaying different oriented gratings, bees extract the orientation information corresponding to each quadrant and integrate it in a generic layout that preserved the spatial relationship between oriented edges. Our results show that the amount of experience with the training patterns is critical to determine or not generalization to novel stimuli sharing the layout of the rewarded stimulus. Increasing experience results in higher generalization levels reflected in significant responding to novel stimuli. With ongoing training, redundant information seems to be eliminated and reduced to the minimum that is necessary and sufficient to solve the task. Controlling precisely the level of experience of individuals is therefore crucial in experiments on visual recognition.","Generalization is a fundamental cognitive ability that allows treating similar stimuli as equivalents, and thus responding to them in the same manner.","Here, we show that after training free-flying bees with a single, constant pair of patterns made of four quadrants, each displaying different oriented gratings, bees extract the orientation information corresponding to each quadrant and integrate it in a generic layout that preserved the spatial relationship between oriented edges.","Our results show that the amount of experience with the training patterns is critical to determine or not generalization to novel stimuli sharing the layout of the rewarded stimulus.

"To use monkeys as models for eye diseases that may lead to blindness, we need to develop a method to precisely measure its visual field and to understand similarities and differences in visual field properties between monkeys and humans. The visual field of monkey was not measured precisely although the necessity. We established a new system with personal computers for precise measurement of the monkey visual field. Four monkeys and three humans served as subjects. The luminance-contrast sensitivity of the central 24 degrees field was measured while the subject was fixating a small spot. During the measurement, we continuously recorded the eye position, and discarded the data when fixation was broken. Reliability indices demonstrated high and stable behavioral performance by both monkeys and humans. The luminance-contrast sensitivity was highest around the fovea, and declined as eccentricity increased. The blind spot was clearly detected 15 degrees temporally. The overall sensitivity was higher in humans than in monkeys and the sensitivity dropped more sharply in the periphery in monkeys than in humans. We recommend this system as a convenient and reliable way to measure visual functions in monkeys in basic ophthalmologic research or in assessment of the drug effects on the visual field.","To use monkeys as models for eye diseases that may lead to blindness, we need to develop a method to precisely measure its visual field and to understand similarities and differences in visual field properties between monkeys and humans.

"Dynorphins, endogenous kappa-opioid agonists widely expressed in the central nervous system, have been reported to increase following diverse pathophysiological processes, including excitotoxicity, chronic inflammation, and traumatic injury. These peptides have been implicated in cognitive impairment, especially that associated with aging. To determine whether absence of dynorphin confers any beneficial effect on spatial learning and memory, knockout mice lacking the coding exons of the gene encoding its precursor prodynorphin (Pdyn) were tested in a water maze task. Learning and memory assessment using a 3-day water maze protocol demonstrated that aged Pdyn knockout mice (13-17 months) perform comparatively better than similarly aged wild-type (WT) mice, based on acquisition and retention probe trial indices. There was no genotype effect on performance in the cued version of the swim task nor on average swim speed, suggesting the observed genotype effects are likely attributable to differences in cognitive rather than motor function. Young (3-6 months) mice performed significantly better than aged mice, but in young mice, no genotype difference was observed. To investigate the relationship between aging and brain dynorphin expression in mice, we examined dynorphin peptide levels at varying ages in hippocampus and frontal cortex of WT 129SvEv mice. Quantitative radioimmunoassay demonstrated that dynorphin A levels in frontal cortex, but not hippocampus, of 12- and 24-month mice were significantly elevated compared to 3-month mice. Although the underlying mechanisms have yet to be elucidated, the results suggest that chronic increases in endogenous dynorphin expression with age, especially in frontal cortex, may adversely affect learning and memory.","Dynorphins, endogenous kappa-opioid agonists widely expressed in the central nervous system, have been reported to increase following diverse pathophysiological processes, including excitotoxicity, chronic inflammation, and traumatic injury. These peptides have been implicated in cognitive impairment, especially that associated with aging.","To determine whether absence of dynorphin confers any beneficial effect on spatial learning and memory, knockout mice lacking the coding exons of the gene encoding its precursor prodynorphin (Pdyn) were tested in a water maze task. To investigate the relationship between aging and brain dynorphin expression in mice, we examined dynorphin peptide levels at varying ages in hippocampus and frontal cortex of WT 129SvEv mice.","Learning and memory assessment using a 3-day water maze protocol demonstrated that aged Pdyn knockout mice (13-17 months) perform comparatively better than similarly aged wild-type (WT) mice, based on acquisition and retention probe trial indices. There was no genotype effect on performance in the cued version of the swim task nor on average swim speed, suggesting the observed genotype effects are likely attributable to differences in cognitive rather than motor function.

"The cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase PDE4A is abundant in the dendrites, soma and axons of olfactory receptor neurons of the mouse, but it is not present in the cilia, where olfactory transduction initiates. Although the function of PDE4A in mammalian olfaction is unknown, patch clamp studies on deciliated olfactory receptor cells in the newt have shown that adrenaline or cAMP analogs can increase the contrast sensitivity to current injection. We used mice to ask whether increasing the levels of cAMP in sensory neurons by inhibiting PDE4A activity with rolipram could lead to changes in the perception of odorants that correspond to the in vitro cellular responses seen in newts. In an automated olfactometer, rolipram treatment (1mg/kg, i.p.) significantly impaired the detection accuracy of 1-propanol at relatively high dilutions but did not affect detection at lower dilutions. Meanwhile, the ability to discriminate amyl acetate alone from a mixture of amyl acetate+citronellal was not affected by rolipram at any odor dilution. In a different task in which mice were trained to discriminate between cups of scented versus unscented sand, rolipram treatment resulted in poorer discrimination at high and better discrimination at low, odor dilutions. In sum, PDE4 inhibition resulted in a consistent decrement in the ability of mice to detect low concentrations of odorants, but the effects of rolipram on detection of higher concentrations were task-dependent.","The cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase PDE4A is abundant in the dendrites, soma and axons of olfactory receptor neurons of the mouse, but it is not present in the cilia, where olfactory transduction initiates.

"Animal navigation to hidden goals (place navigation) ranks among the most intensively studied types of behaviour because it requires brain representations of environments in the form of cognitive maps, demonstrated to depend on hippocampal function. Intact function of muscarinic receptors in the brain was originally assumed to be crucial for place navigation, however, recent studies using non-spatial pretraining demonstrated that animals with central blockade of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors can also learn and retrieve spatial memory engrams. In the present study we addressed whether navigation in the active allothetic place avoidance (AAPA) task, which requires animals to separate spatial stimuli into coherent representations and navigate according to the representation relevant for the task, is dependent on intact muscarinic receptors in the brain. We studied the effect of three doses of scopolamine (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0mg/kg) administered 20 min prior to training on the retention of the AAPA and re-acquisition of the AAPA in a new environment. The dose of 2.0mg/kg was found to impair both AAPA retention and re-acquisition of the AAPA in a new environment, whereas the 1.0mg/kg dose only impaired the reinforced retention of AAPA. It is concluded that, unlike navigation in classic paradigms, efficient orientation in the AAPA task is critically dependent on muscarinic receptors in the brain.","Animal navigation to hidden goals (place navigation) ranks among the most intensively studied types of behaviour because it requires brain representations of environments in the form of cognitive maps, demonstrated to depend on hippocampal function.

"Hamsters are highly-dependent upon the central actions of progesterone (P) to facilitate sexual behavior. P has membrane mechanisms of action in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to facilitate sexual receptivity of rodents. The present experiments examined whether P's membrane actions in the VTA include dopamine (DA) type 1 (D(1)) or dopamine type 2 (D(2)) receptors. Ovariectomized (ovx), estradiol (E(2))- and P-primed hamsters were infused with D(1) (Experiment 1) or D(2) (Experiment 2) antagonists or agonists (0 or 100 ng) to the VTA and tested 30 min later. The D(1) agonist, SKF38393, enhanced P-facilitated lordosis. The D(1) antagonist, SCH23390, attenuated P-facilitated lordosis. The D(2) agonist, quinpirole and the D(2) antagonist, sulpiride, had no significant effects on P-facilitated lordosis.

"In the midbrain, the epithalamus comprises the habenular nuclei and the pineal gland. Based on evidence including imaging studies in schizophrenia patients, several investigators have postulated that dysfunction of this structure is causally involved in symptoms of schizophrenia. Recently, we showed that bilateral habenula lesions in the rat induced some schizophrenia-like behavioural changes, namely memory and attention impairments, but unaltered social interaction in a brief encounter and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex. Here, the possible involvement of the pineal gland in the same behaviours was assessed, by examining them in two series of experiments. In the first, these behaviours were examined in pinealectomized rats compared to sham-operated controls. In the second, they were examined in rats with combined lesion of habenula plus pinealectomy compared to sham-operated controls, to examine whether pinealectomy induced further deficits when combined with habenula damage. Lesions of habenula were confirmed histologically and neurochemically by reduction of choline acetyltransferase in the interpeduncular nucleus. Pinealectomy was confirmed post mortem by careful visual inspection. Pinealectomy induced no deficits in any test, while combined lesions led to the same pattern of deficits as previously observed after habenula lesion, i.e. marked memory impairment in the Morris water maze without affecting the amount of social interaction or PPI of the startle reflex. Thus, loss of pineal function causes no deficits in these behaviours and does not alter the qualitative pattern of deficits resulting from habenula damage.","In the midbrain, the epithalamus comprises the habenular nuclei and the pineal gland.

"Based on clues from epidemiology, low prenatal vitamin D has been proposed as a candidate risk factor for schizophrenia. Recent animal experiments have demonstrated that transient prenatal vitamin D deficiency is associated with persistent alterations in brain morphology and neurotrophin expression. In order to explore the utility of the vitamin D animal model of schizophrenia, we examined different types of learning and memory in adult rats exposed to transient prenatal vitamin D deficiency. Compared to control animals, the prenatally deplete animals had a significant impairment of latent inhibition, a feature often associated with schizophrenia. In addition, the deplete group was (a) significantly impaired on hole board habituation and (b) significantly better at maintaining previously learnt rules of brightness discrimination in a Y-chamber. In contrast, the prenatally deplete animals showed no impairment on the spatial learning task in the radial maze, nor on two-way active avoidance learning in the shuttle-box. The results indicate that transient prenatal vitamin D depletion in the rat is associated with subtle and discrete alterations in learning and memory. The behavioural phenotype associated with this animal model may provide insights into the neurobiological correlates of the cognitive impairments of schizophrenia.","Based on clues from epidemiology, low prenatal vitamin D has been proposed as a candidate risk factor for schizophrenia.

"Prenatal methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) treatment has been shown to induce morphological abnormalities in cortical areas of the offspring. Based on the neuroanatomical and behavioural abnormalities, this treatment has been suggested as a useful animal model for schizophrenia. In a previous study (Jongen-Relo AL, Leng A, Luber M, Pothuizen HHJ, Weber L, Feldon J. The prenatal methylazoxymethanol acetate treatment: a neurodevelopmental animal model for schizophrenia? Behav Brain Res 2004;149:159-81) we have studied MAM-treated animals in a series of behavioural tests related to schizophrenia, such as latent inhibition and pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response to establish the validity of prenatal MAM treatment (20mg/kg i.p. on gestational days 9-15; MAM 9-MAM 15). We found that, apart from a marginal effect of increased activity in the open field, the MAM treatment on gestational day 15 was behaviourally ineffective. Here, we extended our previous study to a water maze experiment conducted in the same batch of animals as presented previously (MAM 12-MAM 15). MAM-treated animals showed similar water maze performance compared with control animals during the acquisition phase and the probe tests. However, during the reversal phase, MAM 15 animals showed impaired acquisition of the new platform location. This might indicate some cognitive deficits in MAM 15 animals in terms of working memory or behavioural flexibility. However, in combination with the lack of behavioural abnormalities of MAM 12-MAM 15 animals in several other tests related to schizophrenia in the previously reported study, the use of MAM treatment (MAM 12-MAM 15) as a valid model for schizophrenia still remains debatable.","Prenatal methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) treatment has been shown to induce morphological abnormalities in cortical areas of the offspring.

"The aim of the present study was to explore putative differences in the responses assessed in an animal model of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) according to the sex and the reproductive cycle of female rats. The model consists of the induction of perseveration (repetitive choices of the same arm in a T-maze) by 8-OH-DPAT (1.0mg/kg). Males and females (pooled in all stages of their oestrous cycle) persevered after 8-OH-DPAT administration and no differences were observed between groups. During the oestrous cycle, this 5-HT(1A) agonist induced perseveration in metoestrus, dioestrus and prooestrus and reduced levels of this behaviour in oestrus. 8-OH-DPAT provoked perseveration in mid-gestation, an effect that was reduced in late-gestation and blocked during lactation. Reproductive cycle changes in the induced perseveration are discussed from the standpoint of the ovarian steroids' action on the serotoninergic system and on the bases of the variations in stress responsiveness along the reproductive cycle of the female. Present results validate the use of females in this model of OCD and could be relevant for studying the role of reproductive hormones in the pathophysiology of this disorder.",The aim of the present study was to explore putative differences in the responses assessed in an animal model of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) according to the sex and the reproductive cycle of female rats.,"The model consists of the induction of perseveration (repetitive choices of the same arm in a T-maze) by 8-OH-DPAT (1.0mg/kg).

"Habituation (a form of non-associative learning) was measured by assessing locomotion in novel activity monitors in CB1 receptor knockout mice and juxtaposed to habituation measured in muscarinic M2, M4, and double M2/M4 receptor knockout mice. M2 and M2/M4, but not M4, receptor knockout mice appeared to have an impaired ability to habituate, whereas CB1 receptor knockout mice showed enhanced habituation compared to wild-type animals. We conclude that CB1 receptor gene invalidation improves habituation tentatively through an increase in cholinergic neurotransmission.","Habituation (a form of non-associative learning) was measured by assessing locomotion in novel activity monitors in CB1 receptor knockout mice and juxtaposed to habituation measured in muscarinic M2, M4, and double M2/M4 receptor knockout mice.","M2 and M2/M4, but not M4, receptor knockout mice appeared to have an impaired ability to habituate, whereas CB1 receptor knockout mice showed enhanced habituation compared to wild-type animals.",We conclude that CB1 receptor gene invalidation improves habituation tentatively through an increase in cholinergic neurotransmission.,1,1,1,We conclude that CB1 receptor gene invalidation improves habituation tentatively through a decrease in cholinergic neurotransmission.
"Alterations in cholinergic functions have been reported to be associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia. Increased M1 muscarinic receptor binding in temporal cortex is associated with delusions in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients and increased M2/M4 receptor binding with psychosis in Alzheimer's disease. However, the relation between M2 and M4 muscarinic receptor and psychotic symptoms in DLB is unknown. The aim of this study was to measure M2 and M4 receptors in the anterior cingulate cortex in DLB and to correlate the neurochemical findings with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Muscarinic M2 and M4 receptor levels in the anterior cingulate cortex and adjacent cortex (Brodmann's area [BA] 32) were measured separately by using a radioligand binding protocol based on binding of [(3)H]AF-DX 384 in the presence and absence of dicyclomine, a potent M4 receptor antagonist. M2 receptor binding was significantly increased, while M4 receptor binding was unchanged in the cingulate cortex and BA32 of DLB patients compared with age-matched controls. Impaired consciousness was significantly associated with increased M4 binding and delusions were significantly associated with increased M2 binding. Increased M2 and M4 receptor binding in DLB was also associated with visual hallucinations. Upregulation of M2 and M4 muscarinic receptors in cingulate and adjacent cortex may thus contribute to the development of psychosis in DLB, with potential implications for treatments with drugs acting on these receptors.","Alterations in cholinergic functions have been reported to be associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia.

"The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an important role in the central nervous system (CNS) by modulating the migration of cells, axons and dendrites of neurons. Fibronectin (FN) is a major component of the ECM in the CNS and plays essential roles in development, cell adhesion and cell migration. Specific FN-isoforms, generated by alternative splicing at three conserved regions, the extra domain B (EDB), extra domain A (EDA) and type III homologies connecting segment (IIICS), have been shown to modulate these processes in vitro and in vivo. The inclusion of the EDA exon in the brain is highly regulated during development and aging, suggesting an important role of this exon in brain function. However, the direct role of FN-isoforms in brain function and behaviour is still obscure. Therefore, to directly assess the role of the FN-EDA exon in vivo, we have generated two mouse strains devoid of EDA exon regulated splicing in the FN gene that constitutively include (EDA(+/+)) or exclude (EDA(-/-)) the EDA exon in all tissues. Here, we show the behavioural consequences of the absence of regulated splicing of the EDA exon in the FN gene. Deletion of the EDA domain in the FN protein results in reduced motor-coordination abilities and vertical exploratory capacity, whereas mice that constitutively include the EDA domain displayed a decrease in locomotory activity in the open field (OF) test. These results strongly suggest that regulated splicing of the EDA exon is necessary for a normal function of the brain.","The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an important role in the central nervous system (CNS) by modulating the migration of cells, axons and dendrites of neurons.

"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. Several toxin-induced animals models simulate the motor deficits occurring in PD. Among them, the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model is frequently used in rats and has the advantage of presenting side-biased motor impairments. However, the behavioral consequences of a unilateral 6-OHDA-lesion have, so far, not been described in detail in mice. The aim of this study was to characterize mice with unilateral 6-OHDA-lesions placed in the median forebrain bundle using several motor behavioral tests in order to identify the most suitable predictor of nigral cell loss. Mice underwent various drug-induced (amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced rotation) and spontaneous motor tests (cylinder, rotarod, elevated body swing, and stride length test). The amphetamine-induced rotation test, the cylinder and the rotarod test were most sensitive and reliable in detecting loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells in the substantia nigra. This study demonstrates that substantial and stable unilateral 6-OHDA-induced lesions can be established in mice, and that these lesions can be functionally assessed using several different side-bias-based behavioral tests. This mouse model offers the opportunity to use transgenic mouse strains and study the interactions between genes of interest and toxins in relation to Parkinson's disease etiology in the future.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders.

Mice underwent various drug-induced (amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced rotation) and spontaneous motor tests (cylinder, rotarod, elevated body swing, and stride length test).","The amphetamine-induced rotation test, the cylinder and the rotarod test were most sensitive and reliable in detecting loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells in the substantia nigra. This study demonstrates that substantial and stable unilateral 6-OHDA-induced lesions can be established in mice, and that these lesions can be functionally assessed using several different side-bias-based behavioral tests. This mouse model offers the opportunity to use transgenic mouse strains and study the interactions between genes of interest and toxins in relation to Parkinson's disease etiology in the future.",1,1,1,"The amphetamine-induced rotation test, the cylinder and the rotarod test were most sensitive and reliable in detecting an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells in the substantia nigra.

"Learning impairment is a common feature of the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL), a family of lysosomal storage disorders associated with progressive neurodegeneration. Murine models for the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses include the well-characterized motor neuron degeneration (mnd/mnd) model for one variant of late infantile NCL (CLN8), and the more recently generated models for the infantile (CLN1) and juvenile (CLN3) forms of NCL. To determine whether these mouse models exhibit behavioral deficits analogous to the learning impairment characteristic of the human disorders, the performance of these animals on an associative learning task was assessed. The abilities of affected and normal control mice to associate a light stimulus with a food reward were evaluated in 14-16-week-old animals using a T-maze. Normal mice were able to reach a criterion for having learned to make the association within a mean of 9.4 trials. The CLN8 and CLN3 mice, on the other hand, required means of 26.2 and 27.5 trials, respectively, to reach the same performance criterion (p&lt;0.05), whereas none of the CLN1 mice were able to reach the criterion within a limit of 30 trials. The poor performance of the mutant mice did not appear to result from impaired retinal function; mice of all three strains exhibited retinal electrophysiological responses to dim light flashes and displayed robust pupillary light reflexes. Associative learning deficits appear to be an early disease phenotype in the NCL mouse models that will be useful for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions such as gene or stem cell therapies.","Learning impairment is a common feature of the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL), a family of lysosomal storage disorders associated with progressive neurodegeneration.

"We first verified that our 12-arm radial maze test enabled demonstration of memory deficits in rats treated with the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine hydrobromide (0.5mg/kg, i.p.). We then investigated whether a systemically-injected quaternary-ammonium derivate of this antagonist (scopolamine methylbromide; MBR), which poorly crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB), altered maze performance after a 45-min exposure to 2.45 GHz electromagnetic field (EMF; 2 micros pulse width, 500 pps, whole-body specific energy absorption rate [SAR] of 2.0 W/kg, +/-2dB and brain averaged SAR of 3.0 W/kg, +/-3 dB); if observed, such an alteration would reflect changes in BBB permeability. The drug was injected before or after exposure. Controls were naive rats (no experience of the exposure device) and sham-exposed rats (experience of the exposure device without microwaves). In a final approach, rats were subjected to i.v. injections of Evans blue, a dye binding serum albumin, before or after EMF exposure. Whether scopolamine MBR was injected before or after exposure, the exposed rats did not perform differently from their naive or sham-exposed counterparts. Thus, EMFs most probably failed to disrupt the BBB. This conclusion was further supported by the absence of Evans blue extravasation into the brain parenchyma of our exposed rats.","We first verified that our 12-arm radial maze test enabled demonstration of memory deficits in rats treated with the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine hydrobromide (0.5mg/kg, i.p.).","We then investigated whether a systemically-injected quaternary-ammonium derivate of this antagonist (scopolamine methylbromide; MBR), which poorly crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB), altered maze performance after a 45-min exposure to 2.45 GHz electromagnetic field (EMF; 2 micros pulse width, 500 pps, whole-body specific energy absorption rate [SAR] of 2.0 W/kg, +/-2dB and brain averaged SAR of 3.0 W/kg, +/-3 dB); if observed, such an alteration would reflect changes in BBB permeability.

"Administration of benzodiazepines is known to be associated with tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome on abrupt cessation. The aetiology of the withdrawal syndrome is not known but a role for the serotonin (5HT) system is suspected. The aim of the current study was to investigate the usefulness of 5-HT2 antagonists in the treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the rat. Male Wistar rats were treated with either diazepam (4 mg/kg) or vehicle for 14 days, then abruptly withdrawn for 24h. Animals were tested in the social interaction paradigm and elevated plus maze. Some diazepam-withdrawn rats were pre-treated with 5HT2 antagonists 60 min before behavioural testing. Acute withdrawal from benzodiazepines significantly reduced social interaction between pairs compared to vehicle or diazepam-treated animals. Similarly, for the elevated plus maze withdrawn animals made fewer entries and spent less time on the open arms than did vehicle or diazepam-treated animals. Single doses of 5-HT2 antagonists, mianserin (5mg/kg) and ritanserin (1mg/kg), effectively ameliorated withdrawal anxiety in the rat, returning behavioural function in the social interaction test and elevated plus maze to levels comparable to vehicle-treated animals.",Administration of benzodiazepines is known to be associated with tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome on abrupt cessation.

"The c-fos expression was used to study the neural substrates of the cued fear conditioning acquisition, preceded by a short exposure versus a long exposure to the conditioning context. A long-context exposure (either during the night or during the day) prior to conditioning, was associated with low freezing in the learning test. Differences in the c-fos expression of CA1, CA3, BL Amygdala, LS and BNST were found between the short- or long-context groups with a pre-exposure before cued conditioning. Ce Amygdala showed no differences in the c-fos expression labeling. We reported the hippocampal c-fos activation during the cued fear conditioning acquisition. Specifically, the CA1 activation could be related with the context-US processing during the CS-US association acquisition, which might prove that the CS-US associations cannot be made without an integrated context participating. The results showed that a long-context exposure prior to cued conditioning produces an inhibition of the CR (freezing), and this phenomenon is related with a specific c-fos expression in CA1, CA3, BL Amygdala, LS and BNST during the fear acquisition.","The c-fos expression was used to study the neural substrates of the cued fear conditioning acquisition, preceded by a short exposure versus a long exposure to the conditioning context.

"It is known that stress can influence the sensitivity to rewarding stimuli. Previous observations revealed that socially stressed rats do not display an appetitive behavioural response in anticipation of a reward. A previous study showed that this insensitivity to rewards (anhedonia) could be restored by chronic administration of an antidepressant. Several lines of evidence exist for the role of dopamine in the mechanism of action of antidepressant treatments concerning their therapeutic effect on anhedonia. Therefore, it was hypothesized that regular activation of the reward system, that involves mesolimbic dopaminergic systems, could counteract the effect of social stress on reward-sensitivity. For this, it was investigated whether a treatment of regular reward announcements could prevent the development of anhedonia. This was confirmed by the result that socially stressed rats that received this treatment were able to display anticipatory behaviour which is characterized by increased activity after presentation of a stimulus that was previously associated with a sucrose reward. Surprisingly, a non-treated socially stressed group, that did not show an anticipatory response for sucrose, did display anticipatory behaviour for another type of reward (enriched cage). It seems that, although one might assume the existence of an anhedonic state based upon the absence of anticipatory activity towards a sucrose reward, this assumption cannot be generalised to other types of reward. It will be discussed whether this might be caused by the highly rewarding properties of the enriched cage which probably has a therapeutical efficacy of its own.","It is known that stress can influence the sensitivity to rewarding stimuli.

"The social recognition paradigm was used to investigate the effect of trimethyltin (TMT) in adult male rats. Consequently, the effect of chronic oxiracetam (OXI) treatment in TMT impaired animals was evaluated. In all experiments, a behavioural testing was performed 3 weeks after TMT administration. Experiment 1: A single TMT oral dose, 5 and 7.5 but not 2.5mg/kg, impaired the natural ability of the adults to recognize a juvenile conspecific that they encountered 30 min before. The dose of 5mg/kg TMT was chosen to be used in subsequent experiments. Experiment 2: Chronic OXI pre-+post-treatment, daily 3 or 30 mg/kg sc for 7 days before and 7 days after the insult, protected the adults against recognition deficit produced by TMT. Experiment 3: OXI pre- but not post-treatment (always 3 and 30 mg/kg) had beneficial effects on the social recognition. The findings suggest that social recognition ability of adult male rats pre-treated sufficiently long with OXI is resistant to the neurotoxicity effect of TMT.","The social recognition paradigm was used to investigate the effect of trimethyltin (TMT) in adult male rats.

"The influence of directional orientation on movement-related potentials (MRPs) during gait initiation and stepping has been investigated in the present study, as well as possible effects caused by the distinction between gait initiation and stepping. Accordingly, electroencephalographic (EEG), electromyographic (EMG) and kinetic recordings were conducted while eight subjects initiated gait and were stepping in three different directions (namely, forward, backward and lateral). Five different movement-related potentials were extracted from the EEG recordings and statistically analyzed. Movement parameters were extracted from kinetic recordings and statistically analyzed as well. Results indicated that variations in directional orientation of gait and stepping were associated to changes in MRPs, but the associations between movement parameters and MRPs were conditional to the kind of task performed. Gait tasks were mainly differentiated in early MRPs while stepping tasks were more differentiated in late MRPs, indicating that differences between gait initiation and stepping might be associated with different levels of preparation and execution. Apparently the changes found in the movement-related potentials were not simply caused by changes in the sensorial input due to perception of the spatial environment, but rather because of variations in the movement kinematics and kinetics.","The influence of directional orientation on movement-related potentials (MRPs) during gait initiation and stepping has been investigated in the present study, as well as possible effects caused by the distinction between gait initiation and stepping.","Accordingly, electroencephalographic (EEG), electromyographic (EMG) and kinetic recordings were conducted while eight subjects initiated gait and were stepping in three different directions (namely, forward, backward and lateral).

"This is a factorial (2 x 2 x 2) spatial memory and cholinergic parameters study in which the factors are chronic ethanol, thiamine deficiency and naivety in Morris water maze task. Both learning and retention of the spatial version of the water maze were assessed. To assess retrograde retention of spatial information, half of the rats were pre-trained on the maze before the treatment manipulations of pyrithiamine (PT)-induced thiamine deficiency and post-tested after treatment (pre-trained group). The other half of the animals was only trained after treatment to assess anterograde amnesia (post-trained group). Thiamine deficiency, associated to chronic ethanol treatment, had a significant deleterious effect on spatial memory performance of post-trained animals. The biochemical data revealed that chronic ethanol treatment reduced acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the hippocampus while leaving the neocortex unchanged, whereas thiamine deficiency reduced both cortical and hippocampal AChE activity. Regarding basal and stimulated cortical acetylcholine (ACh) release, both chronic ethanol and thiamine deficiency treatments had significant main effects. Significant correlations were found between both cortical and hippocampal AChE activity and behaviour parameters for pre-trained but not for post-trained animals. Also for ACh release, the correlation found was significant only for pre-trained animals. These biochemical parameters were decreased by thiamine deficiency and chronic ethanol treatment, both in pre-trained and post-trained animals.

"Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), characterized by inappropriate levels of activity, attention, and impulsivity, has been suggested to be caused by changes in reinforcement and extinction processes possibly linked to dysfunctioning dopamine systems. The present study investigated reinforcement processes in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), an animal model of ADHD. Using intra-cranial self-stimulation (ICSS), behavioral effects of varying current intensity, reinforcer density, and reinforcer delay were tested. Current was varied in order to find the weakest current producing the maximal response rate (optimal current) in the SHR and the controls during high (120 reinforcers/min) and low reinforcer densities (1 reinforcer/min). The results showed that optimal current was significantly lower in the SHR than in the controls during high reinforcer density while maximal response rates were not significantly different. During low reinforcer density, optimal current was not significantly different in the two strains, but maximal response rate was significantly higher in the SHR than in the controls. The SHR produced more responses during the testing of reinforcer density, but changes in reinforcer density affected response rates similarly in the two strains. The decrease in response rate as a function of reinforcer delay was more pronounced in the SHR than in the controls. Overall, more responses with short inter-response times (IRT) were found in the SHR compared to the controls during intermittent reinforcement. The results are consistent with a steepened delay-of-reinforcement gradient in SHR.","Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), characterized by inappropriate levels of activity, attention, and impulsivity, has been suggested to be caused by changes in reinforcement and extinction processes possibly linked to dysfunctioning dopamine systems.","The present study investigated reinforcement processes in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), an animal model of ADHD.

"Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) show performance deficits and excessive motor activity during extinction and in situations where no reinforcer can be identified, suggesting an extinction deficit in ADHD possibly linked to dopamine dysfunction. The present study examined extinction of responding previously maintained by intra-cranial self-stimulation (ICSS) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), an animal model of ADHD using three different extinction procedures. Delivery of electrical pulses were terminated altogether or presented independently of responding using two different current intensities. The results showed that more responses were retained in the SHR, especially during the initial transition from ICSS-maintained responding to response-independent delivery of electrical pulses with current reduced relative to that given during reinforcement. Slower extinction of previously reinforced behavior is suggested as an alternative explanation for the frequently observed increased behavioral output that has previously been interpreted as ""disinhibition"" of behavior in ADHD.","Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) show performance deficits and excessive motor activity during extinction and in situations where no reinforcer can be identified, suggesting an extinction deficit in ADHD possibly linked to dopamine dysfunction.","The present study examined extinction of responding previously maintained by intra-cranial self-stimulation (ICSS) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), an animal model of ADHD using three different extinction procedures.

"We investigated the effects of memantine and donepezil on amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced memory impairment in rats, which was assessed by a delayed-matching to position (DMPT) paradigm in three-lever operant chambers. Aggregated Abeta1-40 was microinjected bilaterally (1 nmol/side) into both CA1 and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus in rats that had previously performed the DMTP task. Memantine (20 mg/(kg day), s.c.) was continuously infused by an osmotic minipump for 4 weeks from 3 days before the microinjection of Abeta. Donepezil (2.5 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered 60 min before the DMTP test session. Bilateral microinjections of Abeta1-40 into the hippocampus resulted in a delayed, but persistent impairment of DMTP performance, which appeared more than 50 days after the injection. Memantine prevented the development of Abeta-induced memory impairment, while donepezil symptomatically alleviated the deficits. Because of a ceiling effect, the combination of donepezil with memantine failed to produce any additive or synergic effects. These results support the clinical data showing that memantine and donepezil are effective for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, it is suggested that memantine is effective for preventing Abeta-induced short-term memory impairment.","We investigated the effects of memantine and donepezil on amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced memory impairment in rats, which was assessed by a delayed-matching to position (DMPT) paradigm in three-lever operant chambers. Aggregated Abeta1-40 was microinjected bilaterally (1 nmol/side) into both CA1 and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus in rats that had previously performed the DMTP task.","Memantine (20 mg/(kg day), s.c.) was continuously infused by an osmotic minipump for 4 weeks from 3 days before the microinjection of Abeta. Donepezil (2.5 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered 60 min before the DMTP test session.","Bilateral microinjections of Abeta1-40 into the hippocampus resulted in a delayed, but persistent impairment of DMTP performance, which appeared more than 50 days after the injection.

"Knockin (KI) mice with a PS1/I213T mutation were compared to wild-type controls on the SHIRPA primary screening battery and for exploratory activity, motor coordination, and spatial learning. By comparison to non-transgenic controls, PS1/I213T KI mice had retarded acquisition of place learning in the Morris water maze without being impaired in the probe trial and in the visible platform subtest. PS1/I213T KI mice were more likely to display whole-body startle to an auditory stimulus and a tighter grip on a horizontal grid. PS1/I213T KI mice also had fewer enclosed arm entries in the elevated plus-maze, but did not differ from controls in open-field, photocell actimeter, and T-maze spontaneous alternation tests. No intergroup difference was seen in three motor coordination tests. The dissociation between hidden and visible platform versions in the water maze is consistent with the hypothesis that elevated Abeta42 concentrations cause cognitive disturbances.","Knockin (KI) mice with a PS1/I213T mutation were compared to wild-type controls on the SHIRPA primary screening battery and for exploratory activity, motor coordination, and spatial learning.","By comparison to non-transgenic controls, PS1/I213T KI mice had retarded acquisition of place learning in the Morris water maze without being impaired in the probe trial and in the visible platform subtest.

"This study assessed the effects of intermittent individual housing on behaviour and brain neurotrophins, and whether physical exercise could influence alternate individual-housing-induced effects. Five-week-old BALB/c mice were either housed in enhanced social (E) or standard social (S) housing conditions for 2 weeks. Thereafter they were divided into six groups and for 6 weeks remained in the following experimental conditions: Control groups remained in their respective housing conditions (E-control, S-control); enhanced individual (E-individual) and standard individual (S-individual) groups were exposed every other day to individual cages without running-wheels; enhanced running-wheel (E-wheel) and standard running-wheel (S-wheel) groups were put on alternate days in individual running-wheel cages. Animals were assessed for activity in an automated individual cage system (LABORAS) and brain neurotrophins analysed. Intermittent individual housing increased behavioural activity and reduced nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in frontal cortex; while it increased BDNF level in the amygdala and BDNF protein and mRNA in hippocampus. Besides normalizing motor activity and regulating BDNF and NGF levels in hippocampus, amygdala and cerebellum, physical exercise did not attenuate reduction of cortical NGF and BDNF induced by intermittent individual housing. This study demonstrates that alternate individual housing has significant impact on behaviour and brain neurotrophin levels in mice, which can be partially altered by voluntary physical exercise. Our results also suggest that some changes in neurotrophin levels induced by intermittent individual housing are not similar to those caused by continuous individual housing.","This study assessed the effects of intermittent individual housing on behaviour and brain neurotrophins, and whether physical exercise could influence alternate individual-housing-induced effects.","Five-week-old BALB/c mice were either housed in enhanced social (E) or standard social (S) housing conditions for 2 weeks.

"Corticosterone (CORT) micropellets were stereotaxically placed bilaterally at the dorsal margin of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Both behavioral and physiological responses were recorded (plus maze and colonic discomfort) at 7 days post-implantation. Corticosterone reduced the exploration of the plus maze and increased colonic distress. The ability of a CRH type 1 receptor antagonist, antalarmin, to block behavioral and colonic effects of central placement of CORT was also examined. The diminished exploration in the plus maze and colon distress observed in response to CORT placement at the CeA were averted by the administration of antalarmin.

"Initial functional impairments after cerebral ischemia often improve considerably during the early period after the insult. Although pathological changes associated with post-lesion improvements have been widely investigated, it has not been resolved whether behavioral improvement represents true restoration of function (recovery) or development of new strategies (compensation). This study investigated whether early motor improvements after focal cerebral ischemia reflect recovery or compensation. Adult female Wistar rats were trained to retrieve food pellets in a skilled reaching task prior to receiving a unilateral cortical infarction induced by photothrombosis in forelimb motor cortex. Animals were continuously tested in the reaching task up to 3 weeks after lesion. The end point measures revealed that reaching success rates remained at pre-lesion levels, however, qualitative analysis of reaching movements indicated permanent changes in forelimb movement patterns. Similar observations were made in a skilled walking task and a test for forelimb asymmetry. These data indicate that lesion animals adopted alternative movement strategies in order to successfully perform the tasks. The changes in postoperative performance were compared to anatomical data in individual animals. The finding that reaching success was not related to lesion size supports the idea that the degree of adaptive behavior after cortical ischemia depends on plastic properties of the remaining intact tissue.","Initial functional impairments after cerebral ischemia often improve considerably during the early period after the insult.

"Wild-type and mutant mice lacking expression of alpha5, alpha7, beta2, beta3, or beta4 neuronal nicotinic cholinergic receptors (nAChRs) were compared on a signaled nose poke task, a multi-phased task used to measure appetitive learning and impulsivity. In the early phases of training, mutants of all nicotinic lines did not differ compared to wild types in the days to reach criterion when mice were required to nose poke for a sucrose reward on FR1 or FR3 schedules, or in their ability to respond to an auditory clicker to receive a sucrose reward. However, mutants lacking alpha7 nAChRs, but not lines lacking other nAChRs, showed impairments when task difficulty was increased such that an auditory stimulus was presented on a variable schedule and mice were required to withhold their responses until the presentation of the auditory cue to obtain a reward. alpha7 mutants were impaired compared to wild types in appetitive learning as measured by the percentage of conditioned responses but overcame their deficits with extensive training for 10 days. However, when efficiency ratios were used to measure impulsivity, alpha7 mutants exhibited lower efficiency ratios even after 10 days of training. These results support a role of the alpha7 nicotinic receptor in mediating appetitive learning and suggest a potential role for the alpha7 nAChRs in the regulation of behavioral disinhibition.","Wild-type and mutant mice lacking expression of alpha5, alpha7, beta2, beta3, or beta4 neuronal nicotinic cholinergic receptors (nAChRs) were compared on a signaled nose poke task, a multi-phased task used to measure appetitive learning and impulsivity.","In the early phases of training, mutants of all nicotinic lines did not differ compared to wild types in the days to reach criterion when mice were required to nose poke for a sucrose reward on FR1 or FR3 schedules, or in their ability to respond to an auditory clicker to receive a sucrose reward.

"Several variables, including age, are known to influence anxiety. Previous exposure to the elevated-plus maze (EPM) is known to modify emotional behaviour as retesting in the EPM at a standard age of 3 months increases open-arm avoidance and attenuates the effects of anxiolytic drugs. This study analysed whether similar results are obtained when older animals are subjected to these experimental paradigms. Overall, increasing age was associated with more signs of anxiety. Additionally, we observed a paradoxical behaviour pattern in aged-subjects that were re-exposed to the EPM, with mid-aged and old rats failing to display open arm avoidance (OAA) in the second trial; this qualitative shift in emotional behaviour was not associated with decreased locomotion. An examination of how age influences responsiveness to anxiolytic drugs, with or without previous maze experience, was also conducted. Midazolam (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) proved anxiolytic in maize-naive young animals; in marked contrast, in older animals midazolam at 1 mg/kg resulted in sedation but not anxiolyis. One trial tolerance to midazolam was evident in animals of both ages that were subjected to a second EPM trial; the latter phenomenon was apparently accentuated in older animals as they do not show open arm avoidance upon re-exposure to the EPM. These data suggest that the age-associated 'resistance' to anxiolytic drugs might be related to a qualitative shift in emotional behaviour.","Several variables, including age, are known to influence anxiety.

"It has been reported that many types of stresses, which caused physiological and psychological alterations in dams as prenatal maternal stress, affected behavioral and emotional traits of their offspring. However, effects of environmental temperature changes, which induce various stress responses in both animals and humans, have not been assessed as prenatal maternal stress. Repeated cold stress (RCS) is a type of chronic cold stress in which environmental temperature changes rapidly and frequently several times within a day. In the present study, to investigate effects of chronic maternal stress by the RCS on behavioral and emotional development of the rat offspring (prenatal RCS rats), the RCS stress was loaded to pregnant rats between day 9 and 19 after fertilization. The prenatal RCS rats showed similar locomotor activity in an open field to control rats that were borne by non-stressed pregnant rats. On the other hand, the prenatal RCS rats showed significantly higher startle responses than the control rats in a light enhanced startle paradigm. However, treatment of diazepam decreased the startle responses in the prenatal RCS rats to the same degree as those in the control rats. The results indicated that prenatal RCS affected emotional development of the rat offspring, but not locomotor activity. Comparison of the present results with the previous studies suggests that there might be unknown common mechanisms among different prenatal maternal stresses that induce similar behavioral developmental alteration.","It has been reported that many types of stresses, which caused physiological and psychological alterations in dams as prenatal maternal stress, affected behavioral and emotional traits of their offspring.

"Carriers of premutation alleles (55-200 CGG repeats) of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene are spared the major neurodevelopmental symptomatology of fragile X syndrome patients carrying a full mutation (&gt;200 repeats). In a proportion of premutation carriers, the repeat expansion is associated with a specific neurological profile involving intention tremor, ataxia, intellectual decline compatible with dementia syndrome, Parkinsonism and autonomic dysfunction at older age, commonly referred to as fragile-X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Typical CNS changes include hyperintense signals on T2 weighted magnetic resonance images and the presence of ubiquitin-positive intranuclear neuronal inclusions. A knock-in mouse model with a (CGG)98 repeat in the premutation range has been generated and shown to exhibit elevated Fmr1 mRNA levels and ubiquitin-positive intranuclear neuronal inclusions, suggesting it may be a valid model for the human disease. Given the specific clinical profile of FXTAS patients, the expanded CGG repeat model was assessed for cognitive, behavioural and neuromotor performance at different ages (20, 52 and 72 weeks). The Morris water maze task exposed age-dependent decline of visual-spatial memory. Open field recordings revealed decreased exploration of the centre of the arena in the oldest group of expanded CGG repeat mice, potentially reflecting increased anxiety. Neuromotor tasks primarily showed decline of performance on the accelerating rotarod with age in the premutation carriers but not in control littermates. The age-dependent cognitive decline and neuromotor disturbances may be related to the progressive cognitive and behavioural difficulties observed in FXTAS patients.","Carriers of premutation alleles (55-200 CGG repeats) of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene are spared the major neurodevelopmental symptomatology of fragile X syndrome patients carrying a full mutation (>200 repeats).

"The influence of different malnutrition techniques on the behavior of adult animals was investigated in the elevated T-maze (ETM). Control litters (C) were composed by eight pups constantly kept with their mother and fed by a 16%-protein diet ad libitum; protein malnutrition litters (PM) were fed by a 6%-protein diet; protein-calorie malnutrition litters (PCM) were fed with 50% of the 16%-protein diet ingested by C litters; malnutrition by increase in the size of the litter (LLM-number of pups was twice the number of pups in C litters), and malnutrition by separation (SM-litters spent half of the day with non-lactating females). After weaning, all groups received lab chow diet until the test day (70th day). During the test were recorded the basal, avoidance 1, avoidance 2 and escape latencies. The data showed that PM, PCM, LLM and SM animals showed lower increases in avoidance latencies, when compared to their control groups. However, malnutrition did not affect escape latencies. The nature of these alterations seems to be nutritional, as the extra-nutritional factors (i.e. maternal care) differ a lot among the malnutrition techniques.

"Stress, especially chronic stress, is one of the most important factors responsible for precipitation of affective disorders in humans. The animal models commonly used in the investigation of stress effects are based mainly on powerful physical stressors. In the majority of cases, these models are not relevant to situations that human beings encounter in everyday life. In our study, an animal model for chronic social stress has been developed for rats using a resident-intruder paradigm. This paradigm is considered a model of social defeat or subordination, and therefore may mimic situations occurring in humans. Rats were subjected daily to subordination stress for a period of five weeks and, in parallel, tested with a battery of behavioural tests. Chronically stressed rats showed behavioural changes, including decreased motility and exploratory activity, increased immobility in a forced swim test, and reduced preference for sweet sucrose solution (anhedonia). Reduced locomotor and exploratory activity represents a loss of interest in new stimulating situations, implying a deficit in motivation. Increased immobility in the forced swim test indicates behavioural despair, a characteristic of depressive disorders. Decreased sucrose preference may indicate desensitisation of the brain reward mechanism. Since anhedonia is one of the core symptoms of depression in humans, our findings suggest that the rat chronic social stress model may be an appropriate model for depressive disorders.","Stress, especially chronic stress, is one of the most important factors responsible for precipitation of affective disorders in humans.

"Rodents previously (Trial 1) experienced in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) apparatus no longer respond to anxiolytic-like drugs during retesting (Trial 2). In view of the fact that the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG) modulates fear/anxiety-like behavior, the present study sought to determine its role in this phenomenon. In order to address this issue, EPM-experienced rats that had received lidocaine, a drug which produces a reversible functional deactivation, intra-dlPAG pre-Trial 1, post-Trial 1 or pre-Trial 2, were systemically injected with the benzodiazepine midazolam and submitted to the EPM apparatus. According to the results, 0.25 mg/kg midazolam increased open arms exploration and reduced risk assessment behavior, suggesting an anxiolytic-like effect in EPM-naive rats, regardless of the intra-dlPAG treatment. EPM-experienced rats administered with midazolam only displayed a similar pattern of behavior when lidocaine was administered intra-dlPAG pre-Trial 2, but not pre- or post-Trial 1. These effects were observed in the absence of changes in enclosed arms entries, an EPM general exploratory activity index. The present results suggest that an increased activity of the dlPAG during Trial 2 would explain the lack of anxiolytic-like effect of drugs elicited by prior EPM test experience.","Rodents previously (Trial 1) experienced in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) apparatus no longer respond to anxiolytic-like drugs during retesting (Trial 2).

"The present experiment was conducted to examine the integration of the motion coherence paradigm in a synchronization task. Random-dot kinematograms were used to generate a pattern of oscillating dots representing four different coherence levels (10%, 30%, 50% and 100%) and one target-alone condition. The participants had to synchronize their arm with the coherently moving dots according to two different synchronization modes (in-phase and anti-phase). The results revealed a substantial performance decline when the target/noise ratio dropped under the critical threshold situated around the 30% coherence level, albeit independent of the synchronization mode. In general, these findings highlighted the impact of the perception of motion based on the level of motion coherence in the visual signal on the synchronization behavior in a perception-action setting.",The present experiment was conducted to examine the integration of the motion coherence paradigm in a synchronization task.,"Random-dot kinematograms were used to generate a pattern of oscillating dots representing four different coherence levels (10%, 30%, 50% and 100%) and one target-alone condition.

"An endogenous circadian pacemaker uses photic input to synchronize mammalian physiological and behavioral rhythms to the 24 h day. Sunlight during dusk and dawn is thought to entrain the pacemaker of nocturnal rodents, whereas moonlight and starlight are presumed to exert little influence. We show that, to the contrary, dim illumination (&lt;0.005 lux), similar in intensity to starlight and dim moonlight, markedly alters entrainment of hamster activity rhythms. Under 24 h light:dark:light:dark cycles (LDLD), for example, activity rhythms can disassociate, or split, into two distinct components, and the incidence of split entrainment is increased when daily scotophases are dimly lit rather than completely dark. The three present studies examine whether dim illumination promotes LDLD-induced splitting (1) by increasing nonphotic feedback during novelty-induced activity bouts, (2) by potentiating nonphotic and/or photic resetting, or (3) by influencing phase jumping responses under skeleton photoperiods simulating increases in day length. Experiment 1 illustrates that dim-exposed animals display split rhythms, while animals without dim light do not, despite equivalent activity levels. In Experiments 2 and 3, dim illumination potentiated both nonphotic and photic resetting, and the specific nature of these interactions suggests mechanisms through which dim illumination may alter entrainment under LDLD. Dim light likely promotes LDLD-induced splitting by facilitating both nonphotic resetting and bright light-induced phase jumping in animals entrained to short nights. The actions of dim illumination may be distinct from canonical responses to bright light, and potentially influence the interactions between oscillators comprising the circadian pacemaker.","An endogenous circadian pacemaker uses photic input to synchronize mammalian physiological and behavioral rhythms to the 24 h day.

"Male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) begin to sing around 45 days posthatch (d45) and tune their songs to match learned templates. Females never develop song, but they use male conspecific vocalizations for mate choice. While auditory perception is critical for both sexes, the responses of the immediate early genes (IEGs) ZENK and FOS differ in auditory brain areas of d30 males and females. The present study examined expression of these IEGs in the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), caudomedial mesopallium (CMM; formerly cHV), and the hippocampus (HP) in both sexes at d45 in response to conspecific, heterospecific, or no songs. Overall, zebra finch song presentations resulted in the highest density of ZENK and FOS cells in each region analyzed, but expression varied across brain areas. Contrary to d30 birds, the IEG response patterns did not differ between the sexes. ZENK-immunoreactivity was significantly increased following exposure to conspecific songs compared to no songs, and zebra finch song presentations produced more FOS-immunoreactive nuclei than both heterospecific and no songs. While the pattern was consistent, significant effects of stimulus type were seen only in the NCM when the brain regions were analyzed separately. Furthermore, levels of FOS- and ZENK-immunoreactive neurons were higher in the lateral than medial NCM in both sexes. Along with previous work from our lab and others, these data suggest that at d45 neuronal responses within perceptual regions are still maturing on some levels, but IEG expression has acquired a number of adult characteristics.","Male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) begin to sing around 45 days posthatch (d45) and tune their songs to match learned templates.

"We recently reported that the centromedian-parafascicular thalamic complex (CM-Pf) degenerates in Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. The contribution of such thalamic pathology to disease symptoms has not yet been established. The present study therefore investigated the behavioural impact of lesioning the corresponding thalamic region (termed Pf) on a range of behaviours present in rodents. There were four surgical groups: (1) sham medial forebrain bundle (mfb)+sham Pf, (2) 6-OHDA mfb lesion+sham Pf, (3) sham mfb+NMDA Pf lesion, (4) 6-OHDA+NMDA Pf lesions. Posture, sensory functions and apomorphine-induced rotational asymmetry were assessed before and after each surgery. Other assessments performed including a timed motivational task, grooming behaviours and piloerection. 6-OHDA lesions induced postural (ipsilateral curling and head position biases), sensorimotor (increased latency to respond to tactile stimulation of the contralateral side when eating or grooming) and rotational abnormalities (contralateral circling after apomorphine). The main effects of combined 6-OHDA+Pf lesions were improved performance in a motivational task (decreased latency to retrieve reward) but worsened piloerection, relative to animals with either 6-OHDA or Pf lesions alone. The thalamic zone common to all lesioned animals involved the posterior Pf. Our data suggests that the posterior CM-Pf may be involved in motivational responses and autonomic dysfunction in parkinsonian disorders.",We recently reported that the centromedian-parafascicular thalamic complex (CM-Pf) degenerates in Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy.

"In rats, lesions of the thalamic intralaminar nuclei (ILn) impair measures of working memory, but it is unclear whether alterations of attention contribute to the mnemonic deficits. The present experiment tested the effects of ILn lesions on a two-lever attention task that required discrimination of visual signals and non-signals. Rats were trained presurgically in the task and then received sham surgery or infusions of n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) into the ILn to induce excitotoxic lesions. ILn lesions transiently decreased accurate detection of signals. ILn lesions also increased omissions. Compared to sham-lesioned rats, ILn-lesioned animals were not differentially affected when task demands were increased by presenting a visual distracter. Finally, a retention interval was incorporated into the task to assess whether the lesions affected acquisition of a working memory version of this behavioral paradigm. Unlike sham-lesioned animals, ILn-lesioned rats did not demonstrate a significant improvement in signal detection when a retention interval was introduced. The transient lesion-induced deficits in the attention task suggest that, in rats, the ILn may contribute to aspects of attentional processing, but through neural re-organization or activity in other regions, there is compensation for the loss of ILn functioning. The ILn appear to be necessary for maintaining performance when working memory demands are increased.","In rats, lesions of the thalamic intralaminar nuclei (ILn) impair measures of working memory, but it is unclear whether alterations of attention contribute to the mnemonic deficits.",The present experiment tested the effects of ILn lesions on a two-lever attention task that required discrimination of visual signals and non-signals.

"Latent inhibition (LI) is the proactive interference of repeated nonreinforced preexposure to a stimulus with subsequent performance on a learning task involving that stimulus. The present experiments investigated the role of the nucleus accumbens (NAC) in LI. LI was measured in a thirst motivated conditioned emotional response procedure with low or high number of conditioning trials, and in two-way active avoidance procedure with the stages of preexposure and conditioning taking place in the same or different contexts. Sham-lesioned rats showed LI with low but not high number of conditioning trials and if preexposure and conditioning took place in the same context but not if the context was changed between the stages. Lesion to the shell subregion of the NAC disrupted LI but LI was preserved in rats with a combined lesion to the NAC shell and core subregions. Moreover, rats with a combined shell-core lesion persisted in showing LI in spite of high number of conditioning trials and in spite of context change. These results show that the NAC is not essential for the acquisition of LI but rather plays a key role in regulating the expression of LI. Moreover, they suggest that the two subregions of the NAC contribute competitively and cooperatively to this process, selecting the response appropriate to the stimulus-no event or the stimulus-reinforcement association in conditioning.",Latent inhibition (LI) is the proactive interference of repeated nonreinforced preexposure to a stimulus with subsequent performance on a learning task involving that stimulus.

"The possibility that the prepulse stimulus typically employed in the studies of prepulse inhibition (PPI) can produce observable response has been questioned recently. Conflicting reports range from observations of prepulse-elicited startle reaction to a complete lack of detectable prepulse-elicited reactions in healthy volunteers. This controversy is subjected to critical examination in the present study. The ability of prepulse stimuli to induce PPI and to elicit measurable responses was examined in two separate experiments using prepulses ranging from 6 to 18dB above background (experiment 1), or 1 to 5dB above background (experiment 2). Three levels of pulse stimulus were employed: 95, 105 and 115dBA. Clear PPI and prepulse-elicited reaction were obtained in experiment 1, while neither effect was evident in experiment 2. Non-startle-eliciting prepulses that are of sufficient intensities to induce reliable PPI are associated with detectable and quantifiable response, confirming that direct evaluation of prepulse-processing is feasible and practical. This provides an additional measure of theoretical and potentially clinical relevance to PPI, and it ought to be included in future studies in patients as well as healthy subjects.",The possibility that the prepulse stimulus typically employed in the studies of prepulse inhibition (PPI) can produce observable response has been questioned recently.

"Temperament is the heritable and relatively stable pattern of basic emotions, such as fear and anger. We explored behavioral features in mice to select distinct phenotypes with extremes of temperament. In a new environment (open-field) with a central object, two groups of 15 mice from 79 screened were separated according to high or low exploration of the object to compose the high and low exploratory groups, respectively. Their performance was mostly identical in the same task 1 week later and still distinguishable 8 months later, suggesting the presence of trait or temperamental features. These mice were further tested in other behavioral tasks. Compared to low exploratory mice, high exploratory mice were less anxious in the light/dark task and the elevated plus maze, showed increased locomotion in an open-field, improved their performance along trials in the Lashley maze (with appetitive stimulus) and had higher latency to step-down in the inhibitory avoidance task (with aversive stimulus). High exploratory mice were aggressive in the intruder test, whereas low exploratory mice were non-aggressive or submissive. These results show that individual differences in temperament influence a range of behaviors in mice. The behavioral profile of low and high exploratory mice resembled the depressive and hyperthymic temperaments of patients with unipolar depression and bipolar disorders, respectively, which may be relevant for modeling mood disorders.","Temperament is the heritable and relatively stable pattern of basic emotions, such as fear and anger.","We explored behavioral features in mice to select distinct phenotypes with extremes of temperament.

"The present study shows that repetitive presentation of tactile and acoustic stimuli evoke long-term habituation (LTH) of the startle response in C57BL/6J mice. This was indicated by a decrease in response strength over several days. For the LTH of the acoustic startle response two controls were included: first, developing hearing loss during the time of testing did not account for the startle decrease--only 7 days of acoustic stimulation but not 7 days of adaptation led to a decrease in the startle. Second, repetitive presentation of loud acoustic startle stimuli did not raise the auditory threshold, which might otherwise have accounted for the startle decrease: prepulse inhibition (used here as a hearing test) was identical after both 7 days of acoustic startle stimulation and 7 days without stimulation. This proves that LTH to tactile and acoustic stimuli is present and fully functional in mice.",The present study shows that repetitive presentation of tactile and acoustic stimuli evoke long-term habituation (LTH) of the startle response in C57BL/6J mice.,"This was indicated by a decrease in response strength over several days.

"Chicks hatched from eggs incubated in the dark (D-chicks) or from eggs exposed to light during the last 3 days before hatching (L-chicks) were trained on day 4 to peck at small cones for food reinforcement. The cones had different patterns (checked or striped) and were located in different positions (either on the left or on the right of a rectangular arena) so as both object-specific (pattern) and position-specific cues could be used to discriminate cones that contained or that did not contain food. After learning, the position of the cones was reversed so that object- and position-specific cues provided contradictory information. No effect of light incubation was observed in binocular chicks that chose cones on the basis of object-specific cues. Monocular D-chicks also tended to approach and peck the cones with the correct pattern in the wrong position, whereas monocular L-chicks did not show any clear choice. Initial choices for one side or other of the arena were mostly determined by the first side visible through the non-occluded eye in D-chicks, particularly when using their left eye.

"We investigated in an animal model of neonatal anoxia whether effects of oxygen deprivation on emotional reactivity can be reversed by neonatal novelty exposure, a behavioral method, involving daily 3min away from the home cage for the first 3 weeks of life. Male neonates were exposed to either 100% N2 gas (Anoxia) or room air (Control) for 25min on postnatal day 1. Within each of the two treatment conditions, one-half of the neonates were further individually exposed to relatively novel non-home cages for 3min daily during postnatal days 2-21 (Novel: NAnoxia=20; NControl=16), while the other half remained in the home cage (Home: NAnoxia=19; NControl=19). Emotional reactivity to an open field was evaluated on postnatal day 25 during four 20-s trials. Among home rats, temporal patterns of open-field activity across multiple trials and initial-trial activity significantly differed between the Anoxia and Control rats. In contrast, these differences were eliminated among the Novel rats. These results show that neonatal novelty exposure, an early-stimulation method that has recently been shown to enhance spatial and social memory, adaptive control of stress response, and hippocampal synaptic plasticity, can also eliminate neonatal anoxia-induced changes in emotional reactivity. These findings suggest that brief and repeated, but mild, changes in the postnatal environment may serve to counteract some of the aversive effects induced by neonatal trauma associated with oxygen deprivation.","We investigated in an animal model of neonatal anoxia whether effects of oxygen deprivation on emotional reactivity can be reversed by neonatal novelty exposure, a behavioral method, involving daily 3min away from the home cage for the first 3 weeks of life.

"Amyloid beta (Abeta) is closely related to the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To construct AD animal models, a bolus administration of a large dose of toxic Abeta into the cerebral ventricles of rodents has been performed in earlier studies. In parallel, a continuous infusion system via an osmotic pump into the cerebral ventricle has been developed to make a rat AD model. In this study, we developed a mouse AD model by repetitive administration of Abeta25-35 via a cannula implanted into the cerebral ventricle. Using this administration system, we reproducibly constructed a mouse with impaired spatial working memory. In accordance with the occurrence of the abnormal mouse behavior, we found that the number of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neurons was reduced in paraventricular regions of brains of Abeta25-35-administered mice in a dose-dependent manner. Considering that the repetitive administration of a small dose of toxic Abeta via an implanted cannula leads to a brain status more resembling that of the AD patients than a bolus injection of a large dose of Abeta, and therapeutic as well as toxic agents are able to be repeatedly and reliably administered via an implanted cannula, we concluded that the implanted cannula-bearing AD mouse model is useful for development of new AD therapy.","Amyloid beta (Abeta) is closely related to the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Using this administration system, we reproducibly constructed a mouse with impaired spatial working memory.","In accordance with the occurrence of the abnormal mouse behavior, we found that the number of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neurons was reduced in paraventricular regions of brains of Abeta25-35-administered mice in a dose-dependent manner. Considering that the repetitive administration of a small dose of toxic Abeta via an implanted cannula leads to a brain status more resembling that of the AD patients than a bolus injection of a large dose of Abeta, and therapeutic as well as toxic agents are able to be repeatedly and reliably administered via an implanted cannula, we concluded that the implanted cannula-bearing AD mouse model is useful for development of new AD therapy.",1,1,1,"In accordance with the occurrence of the abnormal mouse behavior, we found that the number of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neurons was increased in paraventricular regions of brains of Abeta25-35-administered mice in a dose-dependent manner.

"Research has demonstrated that immediate-early genes/inducible transcriptional factors (e.g., c-fos, egr-1) are increased in amygdala nuclei (lateral, basal and central nuclei) known to be involved in fear conditioning, footshock stress and novelty. Although these data suggest that expression of inducible transcriptional factors are involved in fear, other non-shock ethologically based paradigms (predator or predator odor exposure) do not appear to increase c-fos in the lateral and basal nuclei. While the lack of c-fos expression may indicate that predator stress does not engage the lateral and basal amygdala nuclei, it may be that c-fos in the amygdala is not responsive to predator exposure. Therefore, egr-1, which increases in the lateral nucleus following fear conditioning, footshock and novelty, was assessed to determine if its expression is induced in rats exposed to a cat. Five minutes of cat exposure did not increase expression of egr-1 mRNA in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala. egr-1 was increased in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, indicating cat-induced stress, and visual cortex compared to rats that were either confined for 5 min or handled. In the lateral periaqueductal gray, handled rats displayed a left hemisphere dominance, which disappeared in both the cat-exposed and confined group, suggesting that immobility, induced by either cat-induced stress or unstressed confinement, increased right hemisphere egr-1 expression. The results are discussed in a context of differences and similarities in neural circuitry for conditioned and unconditioned fear.","Research has demonstrated that immediate-early genes/inducible transcriptional factors (e.g., c-fos, egr-1) are increased in amygdala nuclei (lateral, basal and central nuclei) known to be involved in fear conditioning, footshock stress and novelty.

"In order to test the hypothesis that the ontogenetic development of the corpus callosum is related to the establishment of behavioral laterality, the rotatory behavior in the free-swimming test was studied in male Swiss mice with callosal defects induced by exposure to gamma irradiations at the 16th embryonic day (total dose of 3 Gy). At adulthood, 43 irradiated and 56 non-irradiated mice were submitted to 3 sessions of the free-swimming rotatory test (diameter of the recipient=21 cm; session duration=5 min; inter-test interval=48 h). The number and direction of 30 degrees and 360 degrees turns were recorded. Animals were classified as side-consistent turners (to the right or to the left) when they did not change their preferred side of rotation in all three sessions and in both turning units. In general our results suggested that irradiated animals present more pronounced laterality than non-irradiated ones. In the irradiated group, the percentage of consistent turners was significantly higher than that of non-consistent turners. In the first session, the percentage of animals that presented strong turning preferences in the acallosal group was higher than in the normal group. In first session, the acallosal group presented a higher average number of turns to preferred side than the normal group. Taken together, our results constitute an endorsement to the hypothesis that the normal development of the corpus callosum is related to the establishment of cerebral laterality.","In order to test the hypothesis that the ontogenetic development of the corpus callosum is related to the establishment of behavioral laterality, the rotatory behavior in the free-swimming test was studied in male Swiss mice with callosal defects induced by exposure to gamma irradiations at the 16th embryonic day (total dose of 3 Gy).","At adulthood, 43 irradiated and 56 non-irradiated mice were submitted to 3 sessions of the free-swimming rotatory test (diameter of the recipient=21 cm; session duration=5 min; inter-test interval=48 h).

"Reduced frequency of theta activity is thought to compromise hippocampal function and so behavioural inhibition. The anxiolytic benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (CDP) reduces theta frequency when injected into the medial supramammillary nucleus (mSuM), posterior hypothalamic nucleus (PH) and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH). These hypothalamic effects on theta could underlie at least some behavioural effects of benzodiazepines. We have previously shown that in a fixed interval 60-s schedule (FI60), CDP injected into mSuM reduced both theta frequency and behavioural inhibition. The present experiments test the effect of injections into PH and DMH on theta and hippocampal-sensitive behaviour (FI60 and open field ambulation). Systemic CDP (5mg/kg i.p.) released, but PH/CDP (20microg in 0.5microl vehicle) suppressed FI responding, though they both reduced FI theta frequency. In the open field, both CDP i.p. and PH/CDP reduced ambulation, but only the systemic injection reduced ambulation theta frequency. Taken together with previous research, these results support a role for PH in the control of voluntary behaviour. They imply that this function may be suppressed, independently of theta, by benzodiazepines. An anxiolytic effect of PH/CDP in FI60 may, therefore, have been masked by a concurrent action of CDP on the PH motor system. DMH/CDP did not affect behaviour or theta in either experiment, despite the fact that this nucleus is involved in benzodiazepine mediation of risk assessment and the flight response. This suggests that, like the control of theta frequency by the hypothalamus, the neural mechanisms underlying anxiety are distributed in complex networks.","Reduced frequency of theta activity is thought to compromise hippocampal function and so behavioural inhibition.

"Latent inhibition (LI) refers to retarded conditioning to a stimulus as a consequence of its nonreinforced preexposure. We have recently reported that basolateral amygdala (BLA) lesions lead to an abnormally persistent LI under conditions that normally disrupt LI, namely, extended conditioning. This study tested whether BLA lesions would induce abnormally persistent LI under two additional conditions disrupting LI in controls, namely, context shift and weak preexposure. LI was measured in an active avoidance procedure. In the first experiment, rats received 100 nonreinforced preexposures and were conditioned either in the same or in a different context from that of the preexposure stage. In the second experiment, rats received 50 nonreinforced preexposures and were conditioned in the same context as that of preexposure. Sham-operated rats showed LI in the same but not in the different context condition or with low number of preexposures. BLA lesions produced abnormally persistent LI with low number of preexposures but not with context shift. It is suggested that the BLA is involved in LI modulation based on the impact of preexposure and conditioning but not on contextual information.","Latent inhibition (LI) refers to retarded conditioning to a stimulus as a consequence of its nonreinforced preexposure.

"In the present study, the effects of intra-ventral tegmental area (VTA) injections of morphine on memory retention of a one-trial passive avoidance task have been investigated in morphine-sensitized rats. Retrieval was examined 24h after training and used as memory retention. Sensitization was obtained by subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of morphine, once daily for 3 and 5 days free of the opioid before training. Post-training administration of the both systemic (2.5, 5 and 7.5mg/kg, s.c.) and intra-VTA (5 and 7.5microg/rat) of morphine, dose-dependently decreased memory retention. The response induced by post-training administration of intra-VTA morphine (7.5microg/rat) was significantly reversed in morphine-sensitized rats. The inhibition of morphine-induced amnesia in morphine-sensitized rats was decreased by once daily injections of naloxone (0.5, 1 and 2mg/kg, s.c.), SCH 23390 (0.025, 0.05 and 0.1mg/kg, s.c.) or sulpiride (25, 50 and 100mg/kg, s.c.), during the sensitization. The results suggest that VTA has an important role in morphine-induced amnesia and morphine sensitization affects this process through opioid and dopamine receptors.","In the present study, the effects of intra-ventral tegmental area (VTA) injections of morphine on memory retention of a one-trial passive avoidance task have been investigated in morphine-sensitized rats.

"Prompted by the theoretical prediction that damage to the hippocampus should abolish exploratory behavior, the present study examined exploratory movements in control rats and rats with hippocampal lesions produced with the neurotoxin N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA). In four daily 30-min sessions, control and hippocampal rats were exposed to an open circular table under room lighting. Both control and hippocampal rats spent a majority of time near, and organized trips away from, a portion of the table (home base) near a large cue placed proximal to the table. On Day 1, control and HPC rats made equal numbers of head orientations and a comparable number of trips, featuring equal travel distance and numbers of stops. By Day 4, dwell times near the home base increased and other movements decreased in the control rats but the activity profile of Day 1 persisted in the hippocampal rats. The high degree of similarity in behavior between hippocampal and control rats on Day 1 and the persistence of this behavior in hippocampal rats on Day 4 suggests that the hippocampus is not necessary for the display of normal exploratory movements per se. The absence of habituation of exploration in hippocampal rats is discussed in relation to contemporary theories of hippocampal function.","Prompted by the theoretical prediction that damage to the hippocampus should abolish exploratory behavior, the present study examined exploratory movements in control rats and rats with hippocampal lesions produced with the neurotoxin N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA).","In four daily 30-min sessions, control and hippocampal rats were exposed to an open circular table under room lighting.

"Adult male albino rats were exposed to varying numbers of tailshocks (0, 10, 50 or 100). The following day, their escape latencies in a shuttlebox were measured in order to estimate the degree of learned helplessness (LH) produced by the varying number of shocks. Only the groups exposed to 50 or 100 shocks displayed evidence of LH. In a parallel experiment, c-fos activation was used to determine the degree of activation of raphe serotonergic neurons (FosIR+5-HT) and locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic neurons (FosIR+TH) produced by the same shock conditions. Compared to unhandled cage controls, all shock groups (0 shocks was a restrained group) significantly activated both raphe and LC neurons. The 50 and 100 shock groups had significantly higher degrees of activation of serotonergic neurons in the rostral raphe groups and the LC than the 0 and 10 shock groups. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of rostral raphe serotonergic neurons and LC noradrenergic neurons beyond a certain threshold may be critical for the development of LH. The relevance of these results for elucidating the neural bases of psychopathology is discussed.","Adult male albino rats were exposed to varying numbers of tailshocks (0, 10, 50 or 100).

"An enriched environment consists of a combination of enhanced social relations, physical exercise and interactions with non-social stimuli that leads to behavioral and neuronal modifications. In the present study, we analyzed the behavioral effects of environmental complexity on different facets of spatial function, and we assessed dendritic arborisation and spine density in a cortical area mainly involved in the spatial learning, as the parietal cortex. Wistar rat pups (21 days old) were housed in enriched conditions (10 animals in a large cage with toys and a running wheel), or standard condition (two animals in a standard cage, without objects). At the age of 3 months, both groups were tested in the radial maze task and Morris water maze (MWM). Morphological analyses on layer-III pyramidal neurons of parietal cortex were performed in selected animals belonging to both experimental groups. In the radial maze task, enriched animals exhibited high performance levels, by exploiting procedural competencies and working memory abilities. Furthermore, when the requirements of the context changed, they promptly reorganized their strategies by shifting from prevalently using spatial procedures to applying mnesic competencies. In the Morris water maze, enriched animals more quickly acquired tuned navigational strategies. Environmental enrichment provoked increased dendritic arborisation as well as increased density of dendritic spines in layer-III parietal pyramidal neurons.","An enriched environment consists of a combination of enhanced social relations, physical exercise and interactions with non-social stimuli that leads to behavioral and neuronal modifications.","In the present study, we analyzed the behavioral effects of environmental complexity on different facets of spatial function, and we assessed dendritic arborisation and spine density in a cortical area mainly involved in the spatial learning, as the parietal cortex.

"Several protein cascades are proposed to be involved in the formation of synaptic plasticity and have been linked to neuronal information processing and storage. Although modified expression of specific proteins following behavioral testing has been shown, no systematic approach for their concomitant determination has been reported. We therefore determined hippocampal expression of signaling proteins, transcription factors and synaptosomal-associated proteins representing key elements of neuronal plasticity in mice following behavioral training. Male FVB/N mice, 12 weeks of age, were used for behavioral testing. After completion of tests mice were sacrificed and hippocampi were dissected. Levels of total and autophosphorylated (T286) alphacalcium-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII, pCaMKII), total and phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK, pMAPK), total and phosphorylated calcium-responsive element binding (creb, pcreb), early-growth response protein 1 (egr-1), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tyrosine kinase receptor B (trk B), drebrin and postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) were quantified in hippocampi of behavior trained animals (n=7) and na&#xef;ve caged controls (n=7). Expression of pCaMKII, BDNF, PSD-95 and egr-1 was significantly increased in the behavior-trained group.

"Lines of fish (Girardinus falcatus) obtained through selective breeding showing different degree and direction of behavioural lateralization in a variety of tasks were tested for their ability for spatial reorientation. In the first experiment, fish were required to reorient themselves after passive disorientation in a rectangular tank in the presence of a salient feature (a blue wall). Lateralized fish proved to be better than nonlateralized fish at using the geometric cues provided by the shape of the tank in order to disambiguate between corners with similar featural information. In the second experiment fish were tested in a square-shaped tank (in order to eliminate any geometric cues) in the presence of salient features (panels) located at the corners. Lateralized fish proved better than nonlateralized fish in using featural cues to reorient themselves. These findings suggest that lateralization may confer advantages in spatial reorientation based on the use of geometric and nongeometric cues.",Lines of fish (Girardinus falcatus) obtained through selective breeding showing different degree and direction of behavioural lateralization in a variety of tasks were tested for their ability for spatial reorientation.,"In the first experiment, fish were required to reorient themselves after passive disorientation in a rectangular tank in the presence of a salient feature (a blue wall).

"Granular cell proliferation in the adult hippocampus decreases during aging and after chronic stress, while it can be increased by physical activity or treatment with the antidepressant fluoxetine. We investigated whether the physical and cognitive stimulation accompanied by stress in the commonly used Morris water maze affects the rate of proliferation and whether the induced changes can be influenced by antidepressant treatment with fluoxetine. Proliferating cells in the dentate gyrus were labeled by three injections of BrdU during the 24h preceding sacrifice. Early differentiation to neuronal progeny was studied by immunohistochemical staining for doublecortin (DCX), a microtubule binding protein expressed in newborn neurons. Acquisition learning in the water maze for 15 days caused a significant decrease in granular cell proliferation in the granular cell layer of the hippocampus. The decrease in the number of BrdU- and DCX-positive cells was reversed to control levels by the use of fluoxetine during the water maze training. Fluoxetine treatment alone increased the number of BrdU-positive cells, but did not increase the number of DCX-positive cells. We conclude that the exposure of adult male rats to water maze acquisition trials is a stressful experience that significantly suppresses the production of new granular cells and that this stressful effect can be blocked by the concomitant administration of the antidepressant fluoxetine.","Granular cell proliferation in the adult hippocampus decreases during aging and after chronic stress, while it can be increased by physical activity or treatment with the antidepressant fluoxetine.

Fluoxetine treatment alone increased the number of DCX-positive cells, but did not increase the number of BrdU-positive cells.

"This work aimed to evaluate further the role of 5-HT7 receptors during memory formation in an autoshaping Pavlovian/instrumental learning task. Post-training administration of the potential 5-HT7 receptor agonist AS 19 or antagonist SB-269970 enhanced memory formation or had no effect, respectively. The AS 19 facilitatory effect was reversed by SB-269970, but not by the selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY100635. Amnesia induced by scopolamine (cholinergic antagonist) or dizocilpine (NMDA antagonist) was also reversed by AS 19. Certainly, reservations regarding the selectivity of AS 19 for 5-HT7 and other 5-HT receptors in vivo are noteworthy and, therefore, its validity for use in animal models as a pharmacological tool. Having mentioned that, it should be noticed that together these data are providing further support to the notion of the 5-HT7 receptors role in memory formation.

"Estrogen deficiency has been associated with stress, anxiety and depression. Estrogen receptors have been identified in the median raphe nucleus (MRN). This structure is the main source of serotonergic projections to the hippocampus, a forebrain area implicated in the regulation of defensive responses and in the resistance to chronic stress. There is evidence showing that estrogen modulates 5-HT1A receptor functions. In the MRN, somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors control the activity of serotonergic neurones by negative feedback. The present study evaluated the effect of intra-MRN injection of estradiol benzoate (EB) (600 or 1200ng/0.2microl) on the performance of ovariectomised rats submitted to the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety and to the open-field test. Additionally, the same effect was evaluated with a previous intra-MRN injection of WAY 100635(100ng/0.2microl), an antagonist of 5-HT1A receptors. The results showed that both doses of EB increased the percentage of entries and the percentage of time spent into the open arms, suggestive of an anxiolytic effect. The highest dose of the drug also increased the number of entries into the enclosed arm and locomotion in the open field, indicating a stimulatory motor effect. WAY 100635 antagonised the effect of estradiol in the elevated plus-maze and in the open-field. The results show that estrogen receptors of the MRN are implicated in the regulation of anxiety-related behaviour. The results also support claims that the effect of estrogen involves a change in 5-HT1A receptor function.","Estrogen deficiency has been associated with stress, anxiety and depression.

"Ts65Dn mouse is the most widely accepted model for Down syndrome. We previously showed that environmental enrichment improved spatial learning in female but deteriorated it in male Ts65Dn mice. This study analyzed the factors contributing to the disturbed cognition of male Ts65Dn mice after enriched housing, by allocating male control and Ts65Dn mice in four conditions after weaning: small (n = 2-3) and large group (n = 8-10) housing, and enriched housing in small (2-3) and large groups (8-10). Learning, aggressive behavior, anxiety-like behavior and biochemical correlates of stress were evaluated when Ts65Dn and control mice were 4-5 months old. Environmental enrichment in large mixed colonies of Ts65Dn and diploid littermates disturbed behavioral and learning skills of Ts65Dn mice in the Morris water maze. ACTH and testosterone levels were not modified in any group of mice. Ts65Dn and control mice subjected to enriched housing in large groups and Ts65Dn mice housed in large groups showed higher corticosterone levels. Aggressive behavior was evaluated by measuring the number of attacks performed in the presence of an intruder. Ts65Dn mice performed less attacks than controls in all conditions, especially after enriched housing, indicating subordination. In the plus maze, cognitive aspects (i.e. risk assessment) and motor components (open arm avoidance) of anxiety behavior were evaluated; no difference in any condition was found.

"Prolonged sleep deprivation in rats produces a characteristic syndrome consisting of an increase in food intake yet a decrease in weight. Moreover, the increase in food intake generally precedes the weight loss, suggesting that sleep deprivation may affect appetitive behaviors. Using the multiple platform method to produce rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation, we investigated the effect of REM sleep deprivation (REMSD) on motivation for food reward utilizing food-reinforced operant tasks. In acquisition or maintenance of an operant task, REM sleep-deprived rats, with or without simultaneous food restriction, decreased responding for sucrose pellet reward in comparison to controls, despite the fact that all REM sleep-deprived rats lost weight. Furthermore, the overall response deficit of the REM sleep-deprived rats was due to a within-session decline in responding. REM sleep-deprived rats showed evidence of understanding the contingency of the task comparable to controls throughout deprivation period, suggesting that the decrements in responding were not primarily related to deficits in learning or memory. Rather, REM sleep deprivation appears to alter systems involved in motivational processes, reward, and/or attention.","Prolonged sleep deprivation in rats produces a characteristic syndrome consisting of an increase in food intake yet a decrease in weight.

"In rats, dopamine (DA) facilitates male sexual behavior through its combined action on D1- and D2-like receptors, in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) as well as other brain areas. In Japanese quail, systemic injections of dopaminergic drugs suggested a similar pharmacology but central injections have never been performed. Recent electrophysiological experiments demonstrated that DA effects in the MPOA of quail are mediated mainly through the activation of alpha2-noradrenergic receptors. Previous studies of DA action on behavior used specific dopaminergic agonists/antagonists and therefore unintentionally avoided the potential cross-reaction with alpha2-receptors. The present study was thus designed to investigate directly the effects of DA on male sexual behavior and to test whether the interaction of DA with heterologous receptors affects this behavior. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of DA or NE inhibited copulation in a dose-dependent manner. Systemic injections of yohimbine, an alpha2-noradrenergic antagonist, modulated copulation in a bimodal manner depending on the dose injected. Interestingly, a behaviorally ineffective dose of yohimbine markedly reduced the inhibitory effects of DA when injected 15min before. Together, these results show for the first time that i.c.v. injections of DA itself inhibit male sexual behavior in quail and suggest that the interaction of DA with alpha2-receptors has behavioral significance.","In rats, dopamine (DA) facilitates male sexual behavior through its combined action on D1- and D2-like receptors, in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) as well as other brain areas.

"Clinical trials show beneficial effects of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, including galantamine, on cognitive functions in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Galantamine shows a dual action profile by also acting as an allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Nevertheless, its in vivo mechanism of action is only partly understood. Here, we first established a novel lesion model provoking significant functional impairment of the septo-hippocampal projection system without triggering massive neuronal death in the rat medial septum. Next, we studied whether galantamine, administered in doses of 1 and 3mg/kg post-lesion, promotes functional recovery of spatial navigation behaviors, and affects the output of septal cholinergic projections. Infusion of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA; 30nmol/1microl) in the medial septum resulted in spatial learning deficits associated with significant shrinkage of cholinergic neurons and reduced AChE activity in the hippocampus at 7 days post-lesion. Galantamine treatment alone significantly increased the hippocampal acetylcholine concentration and attenuated the NMDA-induced spatial learning impairment. Galantamine post-treatment also affected NMDA-induced changes in AChE and choline-acetyltransferase activities. In conclusion, our data show that galantamine attenuates experimentally-induced cognitive impairments underscored by mild neuronal damage.","Clinical trials show beneficial effects of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, including galantamine, on cognitive functions in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.

"Previous studies have shown memory enhancing effects of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors in rats. However, differences in nitric oxide (NO)-mediated cyclic GMP (cGMP) signaling in the hippocampus have been described between rats and mice. In the present study we investigated the memory enhancing effects of the PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil on memory performance in Swiss mice using the object recognition task. Sildenafil (0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg) was administered orally directly after the first trial. The memory for the objects was retested 24 h later when mice show no memory for the familiar object. Sildenafil improved the object discrimination performance of Swiss mice at a dose of 1 mg/kg. Hippocampal slices of Swiss mice incubated with sildenafil (10 microM) increased cGMP levels in varicosities in the CA3 region of the hippocampus and a number of short, thin fibers. Addition of DEA/NO, an NO donor (10 microM), in the presence of sildenafil (10 microM) strongly increased cGMP immunoreactivity of varicosities in the CA3 region. Double immunostaining of cGMP with the presynaptic marker synaptophysin did not reveal any co-localization of these markers under any circumstance. Taken together, inhibition of PDE5 improves object recognition memory in mice. Furthermore, a postsynaptic role of cGMP could be involved in this respect.","Previous studies have shown memory enhancing effects of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors in rats.

"One of the most important criteria for major depressive disorder in adults and in children and adolescents as well, is the loss of interest in or pleasure from typically enjoyable experiences or activities: anhedonia. Anxiety is frequently co-morbid with depression. We examined reward and anxiety in genetic animal models of childhood depression. Two different ""depressed"" lines were studied: the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) and their controls, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and the Wistar Kyoto (WKY) line and their controls, Wistar rats. Recently, we found that prepubertal rats (about 35 days old) from these lines exhibited increased immobility in the swim test, and abnormal social play observed after 24-h isolation. We hypothesized that FSL and WKY prepubertal rats will further show anhedonia in two different behavioral assays: the conditioned place preference test (CPP), examining the rewarding aspect of social interaction and the saccharin preference test. Behavior in the open field paradigm and freezing behavior in the CPP apparatus were also used as measures of anxiety. WKY, but not FSL prepubertal rats, consumed less of the saccharin solution compared to their control line. FSL, and WKY prepubertal rats found social interaction to be rewarding to a similar extent as their control lines, in the CPP test. Only the WKY rats showed anxiety in behavior in the open field and freezing behavior in the CPP paradigm. The results suggest that WKY prepubertal rats are anxious and sensitive to stress-induced anhedonia, while FSL prepubertal rats exhibit none of these symptoms.","One of the most important criteria for major depressive disorder in adults and in children and adolescents as well, is the loss of interest in or pleasure from typically enjoyable experiences or activities: anhedonia.

"It is well known that housing conditions may alter several physiological and behavioral parameters. In this study, we have investigated whether a prolonged period of partial social isolation can modify central brain-derived neurotrophic (BDNF) concentrations. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were singly housed for 8 weeks before hippocampi, prefrontal cortices and striata were collected for BDNF determination. Compared to rats housed two per cage, isolated rats showed a significant reduction on BDNF protein concentrations in the hippocampus while no changes were observed in the other brain regions examined. Moreover, housing condition had no effect on basal plasma corticosterone. On the basis of the proposed etiological participation of reduced central BDNF concentrations in affective disorders, our results would candidate social isolation as a model for the study of antidepressant treatments.",It is well known that housing conditions may alter several physiological and behavioral parameters.,"In this study, we have investigated whether a prolonged period of partial social isolation can modify central brain-derived neurotrophic (BDNF) concentrations.

"Tacrine is a potent and reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the brain. It produces tremor in animals, which is believed to be due to an increase in the brain acetylcholine level following AChE inhibition. The present study was undertaken to investigate the involvement, if any, of biogenic amines in the genesis of this motor dysfunction. Administration of tacrine (10-20 mg/kg, i.p.) produced dose- and time-dependent tremor in Balb/c mice. While in vivo inhibition of striatal AChE activity was observed only for the highest dose of tacrine, a dose-dependent increase in striatal choline acetyltransferase activity was obtained. Serotonin (5-HT) levels, as assayed following a sensitive HPLC-electrochemical procedure, were significantly increased in nucleus caudatus putamen, nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra, nucleus raphe dorsalis, olivary nucleus and the cerebellum. However, dopamine or norepinephrine levels remained unaltered in these areas of the brain. In animals treated with p-chlorophenylalanine, a specific tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor and 5-HT depletor, tacrine failed to elevate the levels of 5-HT in the brain regions, and significantly attenuated tremor response to the drug. Tacrine-induced tremor was also significantly (83%) attenuated by 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonist mianserin (5 mg/kg, i.p.), but methysergide (5 mg/kg, i.v.) could block tacrine-induced tremor only by 20%. Atropine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) antagonized tacrine-induced tremor by about 53%, but a combination of atropine and mianserin completely blocked the tremor response. These results indicate that the cholinergic tremor produced by tacrine in Balb/c mice is mediated via central serotonergic mechanisms, and stimulation of 5-HT(2A/2C) receptors plays a pivotal role in this motor dysfunction.","Tacrine is a potent and reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the brain.

"While there are several ways to quantify peripheral nerve regeneration; the true measure of successful outcome is functional recovery. Functional tests are relatively easily conducted in human subjects; however it is more difficult in a laboratory animal. The laboratory rat is an excellent animal model of peripheral nerve injury and has been used extensively in the field of peripheral nerve research. Due to the intense interest in the rat as an experimental model, functional assays have been reported. In an effort to provide a resource to which investigators can refer when considering the most appropriate functional assay for a given experiment, the authors have compiled and tabulated the available functional tests applicable to various models of rat nerve injury.","While there are several ways to quantify peripheral nerve regeneration; the true measure of successful outcome is functional recovery. Functional tests are relatively easily conducted in human subjects; however it is more difficult in a laboratory animal. The laboratory rat is an excellent animal model of peripheral nerve injury and has been used extensively in the field of peripheral nerve research. Due to the intense interest in the rat as an experimental model, functional assays have been reported.","In an effort to provide a resource to which investigators can refer when considering the most appropriate functional assay for a given experiment, the authors have compiled and tabulated the available functional tests applicable to various models of rat nerve injury.",nan,1,1,1,"The compilation of functional tests for rat models significantly enhances our ability to evaluate peripheral nerve regeneration. While these assays demonstrate a robust correlation between the extent of nerve regeneration and functional recovery, it is suggested that in models of severe injury, increased nerve repair surprisingly does not facilitate enhanced motor function recovery. This conclusion presents potential implications for adjusting therapeutic approaches. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the assessment of recovery in rat models."
"New antipsychotic drugs often increase weight and produce metabolic disturbances in treated patients. However, the mechanisms by which neuroleptics induce these undesirable side effects in humans are not known. Studies have shown that antipsychotics can increase body weight in female but not in male rats. However, no studies investigated changes in macronutrient selection during chronic treatments with antipsychotics in male rats, and no studies investigated precisely body composition after such treatments. In the present work, we studied in male rats the effects of long-term administration of two neuroleptics: haloperidol, a classical neuroleptic which has a moderate effect on weight gain in humans, and olanzapine, an atypical neuroleptic which has a more important effect on weight gain. Treatments (both 1 mg/kg) were given orally for 6 weeks, and the animals were allowed to self-select food among carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. Food selection was measured throughout the study, and body composition was measured by dissection and weighing of the main organs and tissues. Circulating leptin, insulin and glucose were also assayed at the end of the study on blood collected at the time of carcass analysis. The results show that none of the neuroleptic treatments modified caloric intake, food selection, body weight, and body composition. Olanzapine produced a statistically non-significant increase in subcutaneous fat tissue. It is concluded that a 6-week olanzapine or haloperidol treatment in male rats under dietary macronutrient selection does not significantly affect energy regulation.","New antipsychotic drugs often increase weight and produce metabolic disturbances in treated patients.

"The kappa (kappa) opioid system appears to interact with nicotine in the modulation of locomotion and addiction related processes. In this study we have investigated the possible implication of the kappa-opioid system in the effects of nicotine on anxiety and adrenocortical activity. In two different experiments, we analysed the possible interaction between nicotine (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) and either the kappa-opioid receptor antagonist nor-binaltorphimine (5 mg/kg i.p.) or the kappa-opioid receptor agonist U50,488H (1 mg/kg s.c.). Behavioural and endocrine experiments were performed in different groups of animals. Animals were exposed to the holeboard immediately followed by the plus-maze. Serum corticosterone levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Nicotine induced an anxiogenic-like effect in the plus-maze and a significant decrease of holeboard activity. The anxiogenic-like effect in the plus-maze was not modified by any of the kappa-opioid receptor ligands. Nicotine also induced a significant increase in the corticosterone levels, and the kappa antagonist, which did not exert any effect per se, antagonised this effect. The kappa-agonist U50,488H induced a significant increase in corticosterone concentration when administered alone. We provide the first evidence for the involvement of the kappa-opioid receptor in the stimulatory effect of nicotine on adrenocortical activity.",The kappa (kappa) opioid system appears to interact with nicotine in the modulation of locomotion and addiction related processes.

"Consistent with configural/conjunctive theories of the hippocampus, we report that rats trained on the non-linear transverse patterning discrimination problem (A+ versus B-, B+ versus C-, and C+ versus A) displayed retrograde amnesia when the hippocampus was later damaged. They also failed to relearn the solution to this problem. Damage to the hippocampus following training also produced retrograde amnesia in rats trained on a set of elemental discrimination problems (A+ versus B-, C+ versus D-, and E+ versus F-) that could be solved based on the associative strengths of the individual choice cues. However, in contrast to transverse patterning, rats easily relearned and retained these elemental problems and learned a new set of elemental problems after the damage. These results support two theoretical conclusions: (a) elemental discriminations can be learned by both a system that depends on the hippocampus and a system that does not require the hippocampus, and (b) in the intact animal these two systems competitively interact with the hippocampal-dependent system inhibiting memory formation by the extra-hippocampal system.","Consistent with configural/conjunctive theories of the hippocampus, we report that rats trained on the non-linear transverse patterning discrimination problem (A+ versus B-, B+ versus C-, and C+ versus A) displayed retrograde amnesia when the hippocampus was later damaged.","They also failed to relearn the solution to this problem.

"Updating of visual space takes place in the posterior parietal cortex to guarantee spatial constancy across eye movements. However, the timing of updating with respect to saccadic eye movements remains a matter of debate. In the present study, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in 15 volunteers during a saccadic double-step task to elucidate the time course of the updating process. In the experimental condition updating of visual space was required, because both saccade targets had already disappeared before the first saccade was executed. A similar task without updating requirements served as control condition. ERP analysis revealed a significantly larger slow positive wave in the retino-spatial dissonance condition compared to the control condition, starting between 150 and 200 ms after first saccade onset. Source analysis showed an asymmetry with respect to the direction of the first saccade. Whereas the source was restricted to the right PPC in trials with leftward first saccades, left and right PPC were involved in rightward trials. The results of the present study suggest that updating of visual space in a saccadic double-step task occurs not earlier than 150 ms after the onset of the first saccade. We conclude that extraretinal information about the first saccade is integrated with motor information about the second saccade in the inter-saccade interval.","Updating of visual space takes place in the posterior parietal cortex to guarantee spatial constancy across eye movements.

"Sex differences occur not only in the sexual repertoire of animals but also are evident in other aspects of movement. The present study asked whether sexually dimorphic motor behavior extends to the skilled movements used in reaching for food in the rat. Because we have previously shown that males and females are sexually dimorphic in their organization of lateral and rotatory movements and because postural adjustments are incorporated into skilled movements, both body posture and limb movements were examined during a skilled reaching task. Male and female Long-Evans rats were filmed, from both the front and ventral views and their stepping patterns, postural adjustments and forelimb movements, during a successful reach were analyzed. While males and females did not differ in forelimb movements, they were significantly different in how they approached and oriented their body to the food item during a successful reach. These results are discussed in relation to the dissociation of skilled movement from postural adjustments, sex-dependent alterations following CNS injury, and the neural and evolutionary basis of sex differences in movement organization.","Sex differences occur not only in the sexual repertoire of animals but also are evident in other aspects of movement.

"Microinjection of morphine into the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (PAG) disinhibits output neurons resulting in immobility and antinociception. Disinhibition also can be produced by microinjection of the GABA antagonist bicuculline. If morphine and bicuculline disinhibit the same class of neurons, then the behavioral effects evoked should be the same. Microinjection of morphine (5 microg/0.4 microl) into the ventrolateral PAG produced antinociception in 46 of 85 rats (54%). Subsets of rats with and without morphine antinociception were subsequently injected with bicuculline (2.5, 5, 10, and 25 ng/0.4 microl) into the same PAG site. Microinjection of bicuculline produced an increase in hot plate latency that was independent of the effect of the prior morphine microinjection. Bicuculline administration also produced an increase in locomotor activity in most rats, not immobility as with morphine microinjections. These differences between morphine and bicuculline microinjections indicate three things: (a) disinhibition of PAG neurons whether by morphine or bicuculline is an effective means of producing antinociception; (b) the circuitry underlying the behavioral effects of morphine and bicuculline differ; (c) the ventrolateral PAG appears capable of supporting a range of defensive behaviors from immobility to flight.","Microinjection of morphine into the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (PAG) disinhibits output neurons resulting in immobility and antinociception.

"Estrogen has marked effects on hippocampal synaptic plasticity.

"Schizophrenia is a chronic and debilitating disease which is thought to arise from a neuro-developmental disorder. Both the stable tubule-only polypeptide (STOP) protein and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) NR1 subunit are involved in neuronal development and physiology. It has therefore been postulated that transgenic mice lacking either the STOP or the NMDAR1 gene would show a 'schizophrenic-like' phenotype. Here, STOP knockout and NMDA NR1 hypomorphic mice were assessed in a behavioural measure that can be used to detect schizophrenic-like phenotypes: a change in sensorimotor gating, measured through prepulse inhibition (PPI). STOP knockout mice were further assessed in another measure of 'schizophrenic-like behaviour': hyperlocomotion. The PPI deficit exhibited by both the STOP knockout and NMDA knockdown mice could not be reversed by acute treatment with the atyptical antipsychotic, clozapine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) but the hyperlocomotion shown by the STOP knockout mice was reversed with the same acute dose of clozapine.",Schizophrenia is a chronic and debilitating disease which is thought to arise from a neuro-developmental disorder.

"Using the acoustic startle reflex, prepulse inhibition (PPI) is typically demonstrated by the interaction between two auditory stimuli presented in close temporal proximity. When a startle-eliciting pulse stimulus is shortly preceded by a weak prepulse stimulus, the reaction to the former is attenuated in comparison to when the pulse stimulus is presented alone. The present experiment evaluated the influence of different prepulse and pulse intensities upon the expression of PPI by additionally taking into account individual differences in startle reactivity. To this end, we subdivided a cohort of 102 mice into three subsets of equal size differing in startle responsiveness, and evaluated PPI using three levels of prepulse stimulus in combination with three intensities of pulse stimulus. Our results revealed additive as well as complex interactive effects amongst individual's reactivity, pulse intensity and prepulse intensity. At the same time, additional issues concerning the quantification of PPI are highlighted, especially when startle reactivity differs considerably between comparison groups. We concluded that the variation in pulse intensity represents a valuable addition to PPI assessment in general, and especially in genetically modified mice.","Using the acoustic startle reflex, prepulse inhibition (PPI) is typically demonstrated by the interaction between two auditory stimuli presented in close temporal proximity.

"Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was studied in a task, where a preparatory stimulus (S1) cued for an imperative second stimulus (S2) which was associated with a response. Two preparatory stimuli cued unequivocally each for one response.

"Alertness was studied in adult male Wistar rats after neonatal critical anoxia applied under three different thermal conditions: (i) at physiological neonatal body temperature of 33 degrees C, (ii) at body temperature elevated to 37 degrees C, and (iii) at body temperature elevated to 39 degrees C (both during anoxia and for 2 h postanoxia). To elucidate the effect of iron-dependent postanoxic oxidative damage to the brain, half of the group (iii) was injected with deferoxamine, a chelator of iron. Postanoxic behavioural disturbances were recorded in open-field, elevated plus-maze, and sudden silence tests when the rats reached the age of 4 month. Moreover, spontaneous motor activity of the rats was recorded radiotelemetrically in their home-cages. Both open-field stress-induced and spontaneous motor activity were reduced in rats subjected to neonatal anoxia under hyperthermic conditions. In contrast, these rats were hyperactive in the plus-maze test. Both the plus-maze and sudden silence tests revealed that these rats show reduced alertness to external stimuli signalling potential dangers. The behavioural disturbances were prevented by the body temperature of 33 degrees C and by postanoxic administration of deferoxamine. These data support the conclusion that permanent postanoxic behavioural disturbances are due to iron-dependent oxidative damage to the brain, which can be prevented by the reduced neonatal body temperature.","Alertness was studied in adult male Wistar rats after neonatal critical anoxia applied under three different thermal conditions: (i) at physiological neonatal body temperature of 33 degrees C, (ii) at body temperature elevated to 37 degrees C, and (iii) at body temperature elevated to 39 degrees C (both during anoxia and for 2 h postanoxia).

"We analyse a particular class of fast electrocortical rhythms that occur in a limited part of the primary visual cortex (BA 18) during eye saccades in behaving cats placed in a lit environment. Their high frequency (50-132 Hz) contrasts with that of two other classes of rhythms recorded in the same cortical area, the 25-45 Hz visual rhythms (40 Hz) that we previously showed to accompany sustained focused attention, and the alpha rhythms (approximately 10 Hz), that occur in situations of rest. These ""very fast visual rhythms"" (VFVRs) consist of two brief successive trains, a first one of low amplitude preceding the saccade onset, and a second one, much larger, during the saccade itself. The possibility is considered, that the first train subtends a presaccadic attention shift, and the second, a change of gaze towards a new target through the interception saccade. ECoG activities can thus well distinguish between attention shift and sustained attention.","We analyse a particular class of fast electrocortical rhythms that occur in a limited part of the primary visual cortex (BA 18) during eye saccades in behaving cats placed in a lit environment.

"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) has been reported to be efficient in anxiety disorders.

Paroxetine (4 mg/kg), citalopram (8 mg/kg), venlafaxine (8 mg/kg), and milnacipran (8 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) increased the number of punishments accepted by mice in the FPT. Clonidine (0.0039-0.5 mg/kg) and guanabenz (0.03-0.5mg/kg) had no effect on the number of punishments accepted by mice. Clonidine (0.03 and 0.06 mg/kg) and guanabenz (0.125 and 0.5 mg/kg) (i.p. -45 min) reversed the anti-punishment effect of paroxetine, citalopram, venlafaxine and milnacipran (i.p. -30 min). But if the antidepressants are administered 45 min before the test and alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists 30 min before the test, alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists failed to alter the anti-punishment effect of antidepressants. The results of this present study indicate that alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists antagonise the anxiolytic-like effect of antidepressants in mice when they are administered 15 min before the administration of antidepressant suggesting a close inter-regulation between noradrenergic and serotoninergic system in the mechanism of SSRIs and SNRIs in anxiety-like behaviour.","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) has been reported to be efficient in anxiety disorders.

"The starfish Asterias rubens is an invertebrate deuterostome whose nervous system shows remarkable regenerative properties. To understand when full functionality of a damaged part of the nervous system recovers, and to follow nerve regeneration in detail, we carried out behavioural experiments with 29 starfishes that had the nerve in one of the arms sectioned in a mid-arm position. Loss and recovery of normal behaviour was followed by video analysis of animal performance in an appetitive behavioural test. When compared to 13 control (unoperated) animals, the appetitive response of freshly sectioned animals is normal initially, progressively deteriorates up to 40 days after the lesion, and then gradually improves until 60 days, when recovery is complete. This is true only when one of the leading arms in the appetitive test is a sectioned arm; turning the starfish so that both the leading arms facing the prey are unlesioned, results in normal behaviour even at 40 days after the cut. Thus, regeneration is a multi-step process whose time course coincides with anatomical regeneration. At intermediate times the animals have coordination problems in an appetitive behaviour test and these give some insights into how arms may inter-communicate to organize concerted movements.","The starfish Asterias rubens is an invertebrate deuterostome whose nervous system shows remarkable regenerative properties.

"Many pharmacological and clinical studies have demonstrated the importance of the dopaminergic (DA) system for cognitive functioning but little is known about the genetic basis of general cognitive ability that has been demonstrated to be highly heritable. Attempts to detect associations between certain gene loci and endophenotypes of general cognitive ability have turned out to be more promising. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate two dopaminergic candidate genes (COMT VAL158MET and DRD2 TAQ IA) for endophenotypes of cognitive functioning i.e. attention, vigilance, interference, time estimation and sensoric and motoric reaction times. Out of a gene data bank of more than 600 healthy Caucasian participants, 96 subjects (n = 48 males and n = 48 females) were recruited according to their genotype/allele pattern, resulting in six independent groups (COMT: VAL/VAL, VAL/MET, MET/MET)x(DRD2: A1-, A1+) of n = 16 subjects each. Results showed associations of the COMT gene with attention and with time estimation but most noteworthy was an interaction effect DRD2xVAL on interference performance as measured by the STROOP-test explaining 13% of the variance. Findings suggest that a balance between DA related catabolic enzyme activity and receptor density are good predictors for the endophenotype of cognitive interference and that the COMT gene is in accordance with previous studies related to cognitive functioning.","Many pharmacological and clinical studies have demonstrated the importance of the dopaminergic (DA) system for cognitive functioning but little is known about the genetic basis of general cognitive ability that has been demonstrated to be highly heritable.

"Structural and social factors are known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of depression. Since animal models of depression are a major tool to gain insights into the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of this disease it is important not only to exploit but also to be aware of factors that may affect these models. As housing represents a fundamental external factor, which is controversially debated to affect the animals' emotionality, this study aimed to investigate the impact of different social and structural housing conditions on the development of a depressive-like syndrome in the learned helplessness paradigm. Group housing in an impoverished environment led to an increased vulnerability in the learned helplessness paradigm. Groups that were housed enriched, however, were less helpless. Furthermore impoverished conditions did not increase the vulnerability in single housed animals. Regarding emotionality in the animals, basal anxiety was reduced and the exploration was enhanced by group housing and enriched environment. These results suggest that housing conditions significantly influence the outcome of learned helplessness studies.","Structural and social factors are known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of depression.

"Our previous study indicated that taste information via the chorda tympani (CT) activates the central histaminergic system in anesthetized rats. However, the physiological roles of taste-induced histamine release remain unknown, thus to further investigate the relationship between histamine release and gustatory information, in the present study we investigated the effect of taste stimuli infused intraorally on histamine release using in vivo microdialysis in free moving rats. Consistent with findings from our previous study, application of NaCl and HCl caused significant increases in histamine levels further supporting the suggestion that this phenomenon is attributed to the excitation of the CT. When rats were intraorally infused with quinine HCl (QHCl) solution, a significant increase in hypothalamic histamine release was observed. On the other hand, histamine release was decreased by sucrose and saccharin solutions. When rats were conditioned to acquire taste aversion to sucrose solution or saccharin solution, instead of the histamine decrease seen by the palatable solutions, the pattern of histamine release was similar to that seen by QHCl solution. From these observations, it is concluded that the histamine release by the infusion of these tastants may be explained by two mechanisms-by causing a transient increase after taste stimulation and by causing a decrease relative to the tastant's palatability.","Our previous study indicated that taste information via the chorda tympani (CT) activates the central histaminergic system in anesthetized rats.

"Recent data have suggested that the activity of various brain nuclei is modulated during sleep. In this context, we developed the idea that sleep may participate in adapting brain responsiveness to feeding, so as to tune the control of peripheral energy metabolism. In order to characterize the nature of a possible link between sleep and peripheral energy metabolism, we have investigated the relationship between sleep parameters [wakefulness (W), slow wave sleep (SWS), paradoxical sleep (PS)] and the intensity of peripheral lipid and protein deposition processes. To achieve this, by manipulating the amount and quality of food available to rats, we induced states of energy or protein depletion/repletion which would specifically affect lean or fat body mass, which was quantified by an analysis of body composition. In parallel, using a permanently implanted cortical electrode, we measured electroencephalogram signals (EEG) to quantify the time spent in W, SWS and PS. Analysis of EEG changes in relation to the changes induced in body composition, showed that (1) the amount of sleep (PS and SWS) followed the evolution of energy supply levels, and (2) the time spent in PS relative to SWS varied to a considerable degree (14-23.5%) and followed the same trend as the ratio of lean body mass to fat mass. These results suggest the possible existence of quantitative and qualitative interactions between sleep quality and the anabolic and catabolic processes of peripheral fat and protein deposition.","Recent data have suggested that the activity of various brain nuclei is modulated during sleep.

"Considerable evidence suggests that the anxiolytic effects of ethanol may be one of the factors that promotes alcohol consumption. The present study aimed to characterize the effects of intrahippocampal administrations of nicotine and the two neurosteroids pregnenolone sulphate (PregS) and allopregnanolone (AlloP) on anxiety-like behaviours in alcohol-drinking rats. A long-lasting free-choice drinking procedure with an early availability (from weaning) of an alcoholic solution (10% (v/v) ethanol, 3% (w/v) glucose in distilled water) was used. After 80 days of consumption, alcohol-drinking and control rats were deprived of food and assigned at random to six groups. After 100 days of consumption, each group received two consecutive intrahippocampal (dorsal CA1) injections. First injection: nicotine (4.6 microg, 20 mM) or saline; second injection: PregS (5 ng, 24 microM), AlloP (0.2 microg, 1.26 microM) or saline. Following the injections, novelty-directed activity (open field, OF), and motor coordination (80 degrees inclined screen) were tested. Blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) were assessed. Anxiolytic-like effects of voluntary ethanol consumption and intrahippocampal AlloP administration were observed. Alcohol intake increased the novelty-induced ambulation and exploration of central areas, and decreased defecation. The high exploration levels induced by AlloP decreased significantly over sessions, indicating a rapid habituation to the environmental conditions. Motor coordination was deteriorated by ethanol consumption. These results demonstrate the effects of chronic alcohol intake and neurosteroid administration on anxiety-related behaviours, and suggest an important role of the hippocampal GABA(A) receptor in these behaviours.",Considerable evidence suggests that the anxiolytic effects of ethanol may be one of the factors that promotes alcohol consumption.

"Behavioral response to novelty in rats has been linked both to dopamine transmission in the ventral striatum, and to propensity to self-administer psychostimulant drugs. In order to probe the relationship between behavioral response to novelty and dopamine systems we have developed a behavioral model for correlation with positron emission tomography (PET) of dopamine transmission in brain of G&#xf6;ttingen minipigs. In the present study, we measured exploration of a novel object by recording the number of contacts, and duration of contact with a novel object, in groups of six male and six female adult minipigs. We hypothesized that these novelty scores would correlate with the amphetamine-evoked dopamine release in ventral striatum, measured 2 weeks later in a PET study of the availability of binding sites for the dopamine D2/3 antagonist [11C]raclopride. There were significant correlations between duration of contact with a novel object and the amphetamine-evoked reductions in binding potential (DeltapB) in the left ventral striatum of the 12 animals; Comparison of results by gender revealed that the correlation was driven mainly by the male group, and was not present in the female group. We interpret these results to show that propensity to explore an unfamiliar object is relatively elevated in pigs with low basal occupancy of dopamine D2/3 receptors by endogenous dopamine, and with high amphetamine-induced occupancy of released dopamine in the male pigs.","Behavioral response to novelty in rats has been linked both to dopamine transmission in the ventral striatum, and to propensity to self-administer psychostimulant drugs.

"We analysed the interaction between the dorsal striatum (motor coordination and planning) and the hippocampus (sensory information processing and integration) during performance of goal-directed tasks. The performance of rats that had been injected with different doses of the D(2)-antagonist Sulpiride into the dorsal striatum was tested in an egocentric 4-arm maze task that tests striatal functions. Furthermore, hippocampal EEGs were recorded before, during and after inactivation of the dorsal striatum via injections of Sulpiride of rats that were performing a continuous alternation task. Injection of 5 microl of 100 mM Sulpiride increased the number of errors committed in the egocentric 4-arm maze (p &lt; 0.01), indicating that the dorsal striatum is involved in motor control and motor memory recall in such a task.

"Our laboratory has previously characterized a rabbit model of gestational cocaine exposure in which permanent alterations in neuronal morphology, cell signaling and psychostimulant-induced behavior are observed. The cellular and molecular neuroadaptations produced by prenatal cocaine occur in brain regions involved in executive function and attention, such as the anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices. Therefore, in the present study, we have measured the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on specific behavioral tasks in adult offspring whose mothers were treated with cocaine (3mg/kg, twice a day, E16-E25). We assessed non-spatial, short-term memory in a two-object recognition task and found no deficits in memory or exploratory behaviors in cocaine-exposed offspring in this paradigm. We also evaluated a different memory task with a more robust attentional component, using spontaneous alternation in a Y maze. In this task, young adult rabbits exposed to cocaine prenatally exhibited a significant deficit in performance. Deficits in spontaneous alternation can be induced by a wide variety of behavioral and cognitive dysfunctions, but taken together with previous findings in this and other animal models, we hypothesize that prenatal exposure to cocaine alters highly specific aspects of cognitive and emotional development.","Our laboratory has previously characterized a rabbit model of gestational cocaine exposure in which permanent alterations in neuronal morphology, cell signaling and psychostimulant-induced behavior are observed.

"The role of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in the induction of muscarinic antinociception was investigated in a condition of acute thermal pain by means of the mouse hot-plate test. I.c.v. administration of non-hyperalgesic doses of ryanodine (0.001-0.06 nmol per mouse i.c.v.), an antagonist of ryanodine receptors (RyRs), dose-dependently prevented the antinociception induced by both physostigmine (100-150 microgkg(-1) s.c.) and oxotremorine (40-70 microgkg(-1) s.c.).

"The learning and recalling of a lever-press task (LPT) after brief unilateral extradural compression (EC) of the right sensorimotor cortex was studied in Wistar rats. All rats, regardless of the time-point for EC, were trained to lever press for food from D(day)1 to D6. On D8, the position of the active lever was changed to the right side of the operant box and performance was tested until D14. Total and active lever presses, as well as % errors were used to analyse the performance. Rats submitted to EC 24 h before initiating the LPT schedule (na&#xef;ve-compressed group) showed delayed task acquisition and impaired performance until D10. No significant impairments were detected by D3 on a beam-walking test, excluding paresis as the cause to the delay. Rats submitted to EC after they learned the LPT (trained-compressed group) showed only mildly impaired post-compression performance with no effects on the recalling of the task. Using a progressive ratio LPT, the maximum number of presses to obtain a food-pellet (breaking point) was significantly reduced 24h after EC suggesting reduced motivation for the task early after brain injury. The delayed acquisition of the LPT in na&#xef;ve-compressed rats was accompanied by consistent cortical, striatal and thalamic degeneration detected by Fluoro-Jade and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining, whereas the improvement in the performance of this group was accompanied by a reduction of the cortical damage on D10. Recall of the LPT in trained-compressed rats was not altered by EC, suggesting the contribution of compensatory mechanisms.","The learning and recalling of a lever-press task (LPT) after brief unilateral extradural compression (EC) of the right sensorimotor cortex was studied in Wistar rats.

"The detection and identification of behaviorally relevant signals in the presence of competing signals in the environment is a major challenge of animal sensory systems. In weakly electric fish such as Eigenmannia virescens, the interactions between the autogenous electric field and the electric fields of nearby conspecifics can have profound effects on the perception of other behaviorally relevant electrosensory information. To better understand the natural signals that the nervous system of Eigenmannia experiences during the processing of electrosensory information, we examined the electrosensory milieu of Eigenmannia in the wild and in the laboratory. Recordings of the electric fields of Eigenmannia were made in 'black' and 'white' waters near the Napo River in eastern Ecuador. Fourier analysis revealed that Eigenmannia typically experience the electric fields of three to five conspecifics during the day and night in each habitat. The median difference in electric organ discharge frequencies between nearby Eigenmannia during the day was 23 Hz in black water habitats, 41 Hz in white water, and 37 Hz at night in both habitats: these signals are known to activate tuberous electroreceptors and downstream CNS circuits. There was no correlation between the number of individual Eigenmannia detected at recording sites and electric organ discharge frequencies. Further, Eigenmannia apparently do not maximize the frequency differences between conspecifics. In laboratory studies fish were preferentially observed in aggregates of two fish or more. Aggregate sizes observed in the laboratory were similar to those in the wild.","The detection and identification of behaviorally relevant signals in the presence of competing signals in the environment is a major challenge of animal sensory systems.

"Interstrain mice variability in response to antidepressant drugs has been reported in the most commonly utilized behavioural animal models of depression: the tail suspension test (TST) and the forced swimming test (FST). The behaviour of mice was examined in both tests for screening various antidepressants with different biochemical mechanism of action. Previous studies have revealed that drug sensitivity depends on the strain and test used. Swiss mice is the most sensitive strain to detect serotonin and/or noradrenaline antidepressants whereas C57BL/6J was the only strain sensitive to bupropion (dopaminergic agent) using the FST. In the TST, all antidepressants studied decreased the immobility time in Swiss and C57BL/6J strains. Detection of an antidepressant-like activity could be performed using only one test (TST with Swiss mice or FST with Swiss and C57Bl/6 Rj mice), but both tests are necessary to conclude on the mechanism of action.",Interstrain mice variability in response to antidepressant drugs has been reported in the most commonly utilized behavioural animal models of depression: the tail suspension test (TST) and the forced swimming test (FST).

"The congenitally helpless rat strain, which was selectively bred for increased susceptibility to learned helplessness, may model the predisposition to affective disorders, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Other than the selected trait, the behavior of this strain is not well characterized. In this study, we assessed congenitally helpless rats on several behavioral tests. First, we assessed reward sensitivity by measuring their consumption of a 5% sucrose solution. Next, we assessed exploratory behavior and fearfulness in both a novel and familiar open field, and in a light-dark test. Finally, we assessed fear conditioning by exposing the animals to 4 tone-shock pairs on 1 day (acquisition) and then presenting 60 tones over the next 2 days (extinction). Compared to normal Sprague-Dawley controls, congenitally helpless rats showed less consumption of the sucrose solution and more exploratory behavior in the novel, but not the familiar, open fields. They also showed less fearfulness in the light-dark test, but more conditioned freezing to the tone predicting shock. Moreover, this freezing was resistant to extinction; congenitally helpless rats not only failed to show a fear decrement during extinction, but actually showed increased fear, a phenomenon termed ""paradoxical enhancement."" Thus, congenitally helpless rats appear to have a behavioral phenotype characterized by reduced sensitivity to reward, increased drive to explore novel environments, and increased propensity to form and maintain fear-associated memories. This behavioral phenotype is discussed as resembling the personality of humans vulnerable to post-traumatic stress disorder.","The congenitally helpless rat strain, which was selectively bred for increased susceptibility to learned helplessness, may model the predisposition to affective disorders, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.

"The effects of the destruction of the medial septal neurons (MS) with N-methyl-d-aspartic acid on sleep-wakefulness (S-W), body temperature (Tb), locomotor activity (LMA) and thermal preference were studied in male Wistar rats. When these rats were given a choice of three ambient temperatures (Tamb) of 24, 27 and 30 degrees C, they preferred 27 degrees C before the lesion. But they chose 30 degrees C during the initial days and 24 degrees C by the third week after the MS lesion. The MS lesion produced an increase in paradoxical sleep (PS) though this change was not very evident when the rats were not allowed to choose their Tamb. Though there was a decrease in slow wave sleep (SWS), it recovered considerably, when the lesioned rats chose their preferred Tamb. However, the frequency of SWS episodes did not show any recovery. There was a decrease in both Tb and LMA by the third week after the MS lesion. It can, therefore, be concluded that the MS lesion affected the initiation of SWS, as there was a decrease in the frequency of SWS episodes. Study of S-W in the rats that were given freedom to select Tamb helped to demonstrate the role of the MS in the inhibition of PS. It also showed that the thermostat of the rats was reset at a lower level by the third week after the MS lesion. Decrease in heat production resulting from a decrease in LMA, could have contributed towards the animals' efforts to maintain a lower Tb.","The effects of the destruction of the medial septal neurons (MS) with N-methyl-d-aspartic acid on sleep-wakefulness (S-W), body temperature (Tb), locomotor activity (LMA) and thermal preference were studied in male Wistar rats.","When these rats were given a choice of three ambient temperatures (Tamb) of 24, 27 and 30 degrees C, they preferred 27 degrees C before the lesion.","But they chose 30 degrees C during the initial days and 24 degrees C by the third week after the MS lesion.

"We investigated mice deficient for the microtubule-associated protein MAP1B, a cytoskeletal element highly expressed in the developing nervous system, for altered performance in behavior, learning, and memory. Using the multiple T-maze, the open field and the Morris water maze we found that mice homozygous for a deletion of the MAP1B gene demonstrate impaired locomotor activity most likely correlated to a lack of physical endurance in general. In contrast, there were no significant differences in cognitive function and memory retention. In addition, we performed electroretinography and observed a reduction of the a-wave amplitude in response to single flash, white light stimulation. Taken together, these data provide further evidence for an important role of MAP1B in synaptic neurotransmission.","We investigated mice deficient for the microtubule-associated protein MAP1B, a cytoskeletal element highly expressed in the developing nervous system, for altered performance in behavior, learning, and memory.","Using the multiple T-maze, the open field and the Morris water maze we found that mice homozygous for a deletion of the MAP1B gene demonstrate impaired locomotor activity most likely correlated to a lack of physical endurance in general.

"The binding of glucocorticoids to the type II or glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is known to play a role in memory consolidation and long-term memory. The present series of studies investigated the locus for GR effects on learning and memory of contextual fear conditioning. The GR antagonist RU 38486 was administered peripherally (10, 20, or 30 mg/kg/ml), as well as centrally into the lateral ventricle (75 or 150 ng/2 microL), basolateral amygdala (BLA; 0.3, 3, or 30 ng/0.2 microL), dorsal hippocampus (DH; 30 ng/microL) or ventral hippocampus (VH; 30 ng/microL) prior to contextual fear conditioning. Peripheral administration of RU 38486 did not affect fear-related levels of freezing immediately following a footshock or in a long-term memory test 24 h later. However, administration into the lateral ventricle, BLA, or VH decreased freezing in a 24 h retention test, while leaving post-shock levels of freezing intact. Both post-shock and retention levels of freezing were unaffected in rats that received RU 38486 in the DH compared to vehicle controls; however, vehicle rats also displayed low levels of freezing during retention. The data indicate that GR activation within the BLA and VH is important for the establishment of long-term memory for contextual fear conditioning.",The binding of glucocorticoids to the type II or glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is known to play a role in memory consolidation and long-term memory.

"Cannabinoids are postulated to play a role in modulating the reinforcing effects of abused drugs, including alcohol. Experiment 1 examined alcohol self-administration in cannabinoid CB1 receptor knockout (KO), heterozygous (HT) and wild type (WT) mice in a two-bottle choice paradigm. Mice were trained in a limited 8 h access/day to 10% (v/v) EtOH (EtOH) versus water. After baseline drinking levels (% EtOH preference and total EtOH intake (g/kg)), results indicated that the CB1 knockout mice displayed significantly lower baseline EtOH consumption compared to wild type mice. Subsequently, treatment with SR141716A (5mg/kg) significantly attenuated EtOH intake in the WT and HT mice but had little effect on the knockout mice. Experiment 2 examined the CB1 WT and CB1 KO strains in a conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure between saline and 2g/kg EtOH. The CB1 WT mice spent significantly more time in the EtOH-paired versus saline-paired chambers, whereas no significant preference was observed in the CB1 KO mice. Finally, we observed that CB1 KO mice were significantly lighter than WT and HT and that SR141716A did not significantly alter body weight. These results demonstrate that the cannabinoid CB1 receptor is an essential component of the molecular pathways underlying the reinforcing effects of alcohol. Thus, medications targeting the CB1 receptors may be beneficial for the treatment of alcoholism.","Cannabinoids are postulated to play a role in modulating the reinforcing effects of abused drugs, including alcohol.","Experiment 1 examined alcohol self-administration in cannabinoid CB1 receptor knockout (KO), heterozygous (HT) and wild type (WT) mice in a two-bottle choice paradigm.

"The present study aimed to evaluate whether housing condition could interact with nicotine administration in influencing the acquisition of a two-way active avoidance task. Male NMRI mice were either group- or individually housed for 30 days and, after this period, evaluated both in the actimeter and, 24h later, in the elevated plus-maze. On the basis of the percentage of time spent in the open arms of the plus-maze, both group- and individually housed mice were sub-classified into three groups with high, moderate or low anxiety baseline levels. Effects of nicotine on the acquisition of the two-way active avoidance task was assessed in each of these groups of mice using an automated shuttle-box. Mice were treated with nicotine (0.35 mg/kg) or vehicle before each daily training session in the shuttle-box (30 trials) over 5 days. The results showed that motor activity counts were significantly higher in individually housed mice than in group-housed counterparts. The factor ""anxiety"" in the active avoidance test did not reach statistical significance but the factor ""housing"" did. The number of avoidances was higher in individually housed than in group-housed mice. Separate analyses performed for individually and group-housed animals indicated that group-housed nicotine-treated mice displayed fewer number of avoidances than saline-treated counterparts. It was concluded that housing condition may be a useful variable in evaluating the effects of nicotine on learning tasks.

"When an observer walks across irregular terrain, he uses vision to plan his steps. How far in advance of each step does he acquire the critical information? We trained cats to walk accurately down a cluttered alley, and then turned out the light in mid-trial. Cats usually continued to walk without error for one to four steps, indicating that they had acquired the information to guide each step well before foot contact.","When an observer walks across irregular terrain, he uses vision to plan his steps.

"In the present work we sought to evaluate the effects of paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) on the performance of rats in the five-choice serial reaction time task, a test designed to assess attentional function. Adult male Wistar rats were trained to detect a brief (1 s) light stimulus randomly presented in one of five locations in a box specially designed for the task. After achieving stable performance, the animals were submitted to 96 h of sleep deprivation by the platform technique, in which the rats are placed on top of small platforms in a tank filled with water. During sleep, particularly during the paradoxical stage, the loss of muscle tone make the animals fall into the water, thus awakening them and so depriving of sleep. Performance in the task was assessed daily during the 96 h deprivation period and also during seven recovery days afterwards. Paradoxical sleep deprivation reduced accuracy on the on the third (72 h) and fourth (96 h) days of sleep deprivation compared to home-cage controls, and this impairment reverted soon after the beginning of the recovery period. Sleep-deprived animals also showed an increase in omissions in the first day of PSD and a reduction on the number of trials started on the fourth day of sleep deprivation. No significant group differences were observed in premature and perseverative responses, correct response latency and reward latency. Our results thus indicate that paradoxical sleep deprivation impairs attentional function.","In the present work we sought to evaluate the effects of paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) on the performance of rats in the five-choice serial reaction time task, a test designed to assess attentional function.","Adult male Wistar rats were trained to detect a brief (1 s) light stimulus randomly presented in one of five locations in a box specially designed for the task.

"Microarray analysis of human alcoholic brain and cultured cells exposed to ethanol showed significant changes in expression of genes related to immune or inflammatory responses, including chemokines and chemokine receptors. To test the hypothesis that chemokines exhibit previously undiscovered pleiotropic effects important for the behavioral actions of ethanol, we studied mutant mice with deletion of the Ccr2, Ccr5, Ccl2 or Ccl3 genes. Deletion of Ccr2, Ccl2 (females) or Ccl3 in mice resulted in lower preference for alcohol and consumption of lower amounts of alcohol in a two-bottle choice test as compared with wild-type mice. Ethanol treatment (2.5 g/kg, i.p.) induced stronger conditioned taste aversion in Ccr2, Ccl2 or Ccl3 null mutant mice than in controls. Ccr2 and Ccr5 null mutant mice did not differ from wild-type mice in ethanol-induced loss of righting reflex (LORR), but mice lacking Ccl2 or Ccl3 showed longer LORR than wild-type mice. There were no differences between mutant strains and wild-type mice in severity of ethanol-induced withdrawal. Genetic mapping of chromosome 11 for the Ccl2 and Ccl3 genes (46.5 and 47.6 cM, respectively) revealed that an alcohol-induced LORR QTL region was contained within the introgressed region derived from 129/SvJ, which may cause some behavioral phenotypes observed in the null mice. On the contrary, known QTLs on Chr 9 are outside of 129/SvJ region in Ccr2 and Ccr5 (71.9 and 72.0 cM, respectively) null mutant mice. These data show that disruption of the chemokine network interferes with motivational effects of alcohol.","Microarray analysis of human alcoholic brain and cultured cells exposed to ethanol showed significant changes in expression of genes related to immune or inflammatory responses, including chemokines and chemokine receptors. To test the hypothesis that chemokines exhibit previously undiscovered pleiotropic effects important for the behavioral actions of ethanol, we studied mutant mice with deletion of the Ccr2, Ccr5, Ccl2 or Ccl3 genes.","Deletion of Ccr2, Ccl2 (females) or Ccl3 in mice resulted in lower preference for alcohol and consumption of lower amounts of alcohol in a two-bottle choice test as compared with wild-type mice.

"This study investigated the effect of amphetamine (AMP) on skilled forelimb use following focal cortical ischaemic lesions in the rat. Unilateral lesions were produced by a novel method of intracortical microinjection of endothelin-1 (ET-1), intended to principally target the forelimb representation zone in primary motor-primary somatosensory cortex. Lesions were placed in the hemisphere contralateral to the preferred limb and produced deficits in skilled forelimb use on two tasks: the paw reach (PR) test and the foot fault (FF) test. Beginning on post-lesion day (D) 2, animals received injections of 2 mg/kg AMP and were injected every third day until D26. Animals were tested both during, and 24 h after, AMP administration. AMP facilitated recovery of skilled forelimb use on the PR test when assessed during drug-free test sessions. No such effect was seen on the FF test. These results demonstrate that sub-acute administration of AMP following a unilateral focal ischaemic lesion of FL can facilitate task-dependent recovery of skilled forelimb use in the rat. They also demonstrate that different behavioural tasks measuring superficially similar behavioural outputs may show different sensitivities to such drug effects.","This study investigated the effect of amphetamine (AMP) on skilled forelimb use following focal cortical ischaemic lesions in the rat.

"The behavioral consequences of intermittent, 5 s cold-water swims (15 degrees C) or confinement were assessed 24 h after stress in a 5 min forced swim test or an instrumental swim escape test (SET). The SET was conducted with temporal and instrumental parameters similar to the shock-motivated shuttle escape test. The tests detected significantly increased immobility in the forced swim test and increased latency to escape in the SET. These results extend previous findings with intermittent swim stress and provide evidence that intermittent swim stress produces behavioral deficits similar to other stress models. This new model may be a useful tool for exploring the physiological mechanisms underlying the stress response.","The behavioral consequences of intermittent, 5 s cold-water swims (15 degrees C) or confinement were assessed 24 h after stress in a 5 min forced swim test or an instrumental swim escape test (SET).",The SET was conducted with temporal and instrumental parameters similar to the shock-motivated shuttle escape test.,The tests detected significantly increased immobility in the forced swim test and increased latency to escape in the SET.

"The present study was aimed at testing the prediction of the Pavlovian excitatory conditioning explanation of context-specific sensitization that the sensitized effect (SE) should persist as long as the post-sensitization conditioned activity (CR). C57BL/6J mice were tested for the expression of cocaine-induced conditioned and sensitized locomotion on several intervals after the establishment of a sensitization in an unchanging context. A group of mice received 10 once-daily injections of 10 mg/kg cocaine (s.c.) in a short time prior to being tested in activity-meters for 60 min sessions (cocaine-pretreated group), mice from a control group receiving saline in the same manner (saline-pretreated group). On the test sessions, taking place 1, 8 and 28 days after cocaine pretreatment, half of the animals of each pretreatment group (n=8) received a challenge test with saline and the other half with 10 mg/kg cocaine in the pretreatment context room (for CR and SE tests, respectively). The CR was significantly expressed on the three successive saline-challenge tests, albeit the activity levels were markedly decreased on the 28-day retention test. In contrast, the SE was significantly expressed only during the first half of the 1-day test session and the first 10 min of the 8-day test session, no SE effect being expressed on the 28-day retention test.

"Sucrose-induced antennal and proboscis motor responses of the honey bee were comparatively studied using muscle responses. The activity of the proboscis muscle responses was correlated with sucrose stimulus concentration, but that of antennal muscle responses was not. Both responses habituated following repetitive stimulation with a low sucrose concentration and dishabituated upon stimulation with a high sucrose concentration. Despite the different response properties of the responses, their habituation kinetics were indistinguishable. The absence of sensory adaptation was confirmed by taste hair recordings.

"The effects of inhibitors of different subtypes of potassium (K+) channels were investigated in the mouse forced swimming test (FST).

"Neonatal exposure to an immune challenge has been shown to alter many facets of adult physiology including fever responses to a similar infection. However, there is a paucity of information regarding its effects on adult behaviours. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered a single injection of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at 14 days old and were compared, when they reached adulthood, with neonatally saline-treated controls in several behavioural tests of unconditioned fear and anxiety. There was no effect of the neonatal treatment on performance in either the elevated plus maze, modified Porsolt's forced swim test or the open field test. However, neonatally LPS-treated rats did show significantly reduced exploration of novel objects introduced to the open field arena, indicating an effect of the neonatal immune challenge on behaviours relating to anxiety in the adult.","Neonatal exposure to an immune challenge has been shown to alter many facets of adult physiology including fever responses to a similar infection.

"Bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCAO) followed by exposure to a hypoxic condition (8% oxygen for 10 or 15 min) was performed in postnatal day 4 SD rats. Brain injury and myelination changes were examined on postnatal day 21 (P21) and tests for neurobehavioral toxicity were performed from P3 to P21. BCAO followed by 10 or 15 min hypoxic insult resulted in mild and severe, respectively, brain injury, reduction in mature oligodendrocytes and tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons and impaired myelination as indicated by decreased myelin basic protein immunostaining in the P21 rat brain. Hypoxia-ischemia also affected physical development (body weight gain and eye opening) and neurobehavioral performance, such as righting reflex, wire hanging maneuver, cliff avoidance, locomotor activity, gait analysis, responses in the elevated plus-maze and passive avoidance.

"Brain-pancreas relative protein (BPRP) is a novel protein whose biological function remains unknown. Here, we report a possible role of BPRP in male rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) to induce depression for 3 weeks. Compared to unstressed rats, those exposed to CUMS showed significantly less weight gain with age, decreased consumption of (and preference for) sucrose without a change in total fluid consumption. Exposure to CUMS significantly reduced open-field exploration, rearing and grooming indicative of lethargy, apathy and bodily neglect, respectively. Brain MAO-A and MAO-B activity were both significantly increased in the stressed rats. These results verified induction of depressive symptoms by CUMS. The stressed animals showed a significant reduction in pancreatic BPRP, which was accompanied by an increase in levels of blood sugar and a decrease of insulin. But they showed no apparent alteration in levels or distribution of BPRP in the hippocampal formation, which nevertheless displayed a thinner dentate granule cell layer perhaps related to elevated MAO-B activity. These findings suggest that stress-induced reduction of pancreatic BPRP may cause diabetic symptoms. Whether those symptoms in turn contribute to the onset of depression requires further study.","Brain-pancreas relative protein (BPRP) is a novel protein whose biological function remains unknown.

"Three experiments explored the role of the opioid system in consummatory successive negative contrast.

A similar but shorter effect was observed with the delta-opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole (1mg/kg). In Experiment 2, naloxone increased suppression after a more conventional 32--&gt;4 sucrose shift. In Experiment 3, rats classified as expressing slow recovery from contrast (after a 32--&gt;4 sucrose downshift) were more sensitive to naloxone in an activity test than fast-recovery rats.

"Experimental therapies for Parkinson's disease are commonly validated in unilateral rat lesion models using simple tests of motor asymmetry such as rotation. However, the human disorder is considerably more complex than this, and alternative tests that yield a more relevant evaluation of the lesion-induced deficit could provide a powerful behavioural tool for analysis of novel therapies. This study evaluated the potential of a lateralised nose-poking task for detailed assessment of the deficit in rats with complete unilateral and partial nigrostriatal terminal lesions induced by unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) or striatum, respectively. To maximise the task's potential for revealing chronic deficits, a version of the task that requires rats to nose-poke away from visual stimuli associated with food rewards was used. Because of its low stimulus-response compatibility, performance of this version is not mediated by the rats innate tendencies, and thus, is less likely to spontaneously recover after partial lesions. Two weeks and 4 months after lesion surgery, both groups of lesioned rats developed an ipsilateral responding bias with a corresponding drop in contralateral accuracy. Rats with complete (but not partial) lesions also developed a deficit in attempting trials, reacting to stimuli requiring a contralateral nose-poke and executing movements bilaterally. This experiment suggests that the version of the lateralised nose-poking task requiring an arbitrary stimulus-response association may be a powerful behavioural tool for assessment of complete or partial dopamine lesions, and any subsequent dopamine replacement strategy.","Experimental therapies for Parkinson's disease are commonly validated in unilateral rat lesion models using simple tests of motor asymmetry such as rotation.

"Exploration of the long elevated alley (the rat Suok test) enables behavioural characterisation of anxiety, activity and neurological phenotypes in rats. Here we show that this new test is sensitive to different types of anxiety in rats, including drugs (pentylenetetrazole)-induced, light-induced and socially induced (encounter with an unfamiliar male) anxiety, as assessed by reduced Suok test horizontal, vertical, directed exploration and stops. High anxiety also leads to higher motor incoordination (as assessed by the number of falls and hind-paw slips), suggesting that this test may be used for combined profiling of anxiety, motor-vestibular anomalies and anxiety-induced motor incoordination in rats. This new behavioural paradigm may be widely used in neurobehavioural stress research, including modelling of stress-evoked states and pharmacological screening of psychotropic drugs.","Exploration of the long elevated alley (the rat Suok test) enables behavioural characterisation of anxiety, activity and neurological phenotypes in rats.","Here we show that this new test is sensitive to different types of anxiety in rats, including drugs (pentylenetetrazole)-induced, light-induced and socially induced (encounter with an unfamiliar male) anxiety, as assessed by reduced Suok test horizontal, vertical, directed exploration and stops.","High anxiety also leads to higher motor incoordination (as assessed by the number of falls and hind-paw slips), suggesting that this test may be used for combined profiling of anxiety, motor-vestibular anomalies and anxiety-induced motor incoordination in rats.

"In the systemic autoimmune/inflammatory lupus erythematosus disease, the involvement of the central nervous system is well recognized and frequently includes deficits in neurological function, cognition, and affect. The (NZW x BXSB)F1 lupus-prone mice are model of this pathology, in which a gene located on the Y chromosome provokes a sex specific morbidity in males. The present study examines whether autoimmune (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice develop impairments in learning and memory that correlate with severity of lupus-like disease. For this purpose, spatial and motor abilities were evaluated in 6- and 20-week-old male and female mice, and the immune status of these behaviorally tested mice was assessed by the presence of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAbs) in the serum. The results showed that none of the animals had motor skill and motor learning disabilities, but that the older males were greatly impaired in their spatial abilities while the young ones and the females, whatever their age, were not. Besides, the ANAbs levels were similar and low in the young males, the young females and the old females, and very much higher in the old males, showing that spatial alterations were correlated to the anti-nuclear antibodies level.","In the systemic autoimmune/inflammatory lupus erythematosus disease, the involvement of the central nervous system is well recognized and frequently includes deficits in neurological function, cognition, and affect.

"Reactivity to novelty has been related to operant drug self-administration but does not seem involved in the conditioned place preference (CPP). To further assess this issue our aims were to investigate: (1) the importance of the initial versus delayed activity in the novel environment to predict the CPP induced by morphine; (2) the separate contribution of trait anxiety in morphine CPP. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to a circular corridor for 30 min to assess reactivity to novelty and to the elevated plus-maze and the light-dark tests as measures of anxiety and morphine CPP was then studied (three pairings with 5 mg/kg s.c. morphine and three with saline). Delayed activity in the corridor (16-30 min) correlated positively with CPP score, whereas the initial activity (0-15 min) did not. High-responders (HR), those more active during the second half of the corridor, developed morphine CPP in contrast to low-responders (LR). Also, HR and LR did not differ in anxiety nor any plus-maze or light-dark test measure correlated with CPP behaviour. Enhanced vulnerability to develop morphine CPP is predicted by a higher delayed activity in a novel environment, regardless of anxiety.",Reactivity to novelty has been related to operant drug self-administration but does not seem involved in the conditioned place preference (CPP). To further assess this issue our aims were to investigate: (1) the importance of the initial versus delayed activity in the novel environment to predict the CPP induced by morphine; (2) the separate contribution of trait anxiety in morphine CPP.,Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to a circular corridor for 30 min to assess reactivity to novelty and to the elevated plus-maze and the light-dark tests as measures of anxiety and morphine CPP was then studied (three pairings with 5 mg/kg s.c. morphine and three with saline).,"Delayed activity in the corridor (16-30 min) correlated positively with CPP score, whereas the initial activity (0-15 min) did not. High-responders (HR), those more active during the second half of the corridor, developed morphine CPP in contrast to low-responders (LR). Also, HR and LR did not differ in anxiety nor any plus-maze or light-dark test measure correlated with CPP behaviour. Enhanced vulnerability to develop morphine CPP is predicted by a higher delayed activity in a novel environment, regardless of anxiety.",1,1,1,"Delayed activity in the corridor (16-30 min) correlated positively with CPP score, whereas the initial activity (0-15 min) did not.

"Aging has diverse effects on different behaviors and underlying neural systems. This study utilized fear conditioning to determine if aged mice have deficits in the acquisition and/or retention of memories for contextual or cued fear conditioning, and to determine if galantamine, an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor and allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptors, would alter acquisition and/or retention of fear conditioning memories in young (2-3 months) and aged (19-20 months) C57BL/6 mice. Mice were trained with two white-noise CS (85 dB, 30 s)-footshock US (0.57 mA, 2 s) presentations. In the initial study, separate groups were tested 24, 48, or 96 h post-training. All mice were retested 1 week after the initial test. Aged mice were impaired in freezing to the CS for the 48 and 96 h train-test intervals, but not the 24-h interval. When retested 1 week after the initial test, freezing to the CS was significantly lower for all train-test intervals. No age-related deficits were found in contextual fear conditioning. In the second study, 2 mg/kg galantamine was administered to young and aged mice before fear conditioning and conditioned fear was assessed 48 h later. No age-related deficits in cued fear conditioning were seen in galantamine-treated aged mice. Thus, aged C57BL/6 mice are impaired in the long-term retention of auditory cued fear conditioning, but not the acquisition of auditory cued or contextual fear conditioning. This retention deficit for cued fear conditioning is ameliorated by treatment with the AChE inhibitor galantamine.","Aging has diverse effects on different behaviors and underlying neural systems.

"Recent pharmacological studies in animals and neuroimaging studies in normal humans suggest that the spatial and nonspatial cues in tasks measuring reflexive attention may be modulated by different neurotransmitter systems. The efficiency with which attention is oriented to explicit spatial cues may be altered by manipulating levels of brain acetylcholine, whereas reactions to nonspatial cues may be influenced by altering brain noradrenaline levels but not acetylcholine levels. In humans, however, previous attention studies have implicated dopamine when either explicit or implicit cueing is used. Some of the differences between animal and human work may be due to inadequate testing of nonspatial cues. To remedy this, we tested adult humans with ADHD that were primarily inattentive (ADHD/I) or combined inattentive/hyperactive (ADHD/C) and controls with the Attention Network Task that assesses both reflexive and voluntary attention and explicitly tests nonspatial cueing. Our results showed that spatial orienting in both subtypes was no different than controls. However, ADHD/C but not ADHD/I subjects had significantly slowed response times to nonspatial cues and cues with spatial conflict. Stimulant medication in a subset of ADHD/C subjects reduced these deficits to control levels. Based on these results, we conclude that ADHD/C subjects orient the focus of their attention normally but are impaired in their reactions both to abrupt visual cues and those that contain conflicting spatial cues.","Recent pharmacological studies in animals and neuroimaging studies in normal humans suggest that the spatial and nonspatial cues in tasks measuring reflexive attention may be modulated by different neurotransmitter systems.

"Previous studies suggest that monkeys process local elements of hierarchical visual patterns more quickly and more accurately than they process the global shape. These results could be indicative of differences between relatively high visual functions of humans and non-human primates. It is, however, important to rule out that relatively low-level factors can explain these differences. We addressed this issue with two experiments carried out on capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) using matching-to-sample tasks featuring hierarchical stimuli. The first experiment assessed whether manipulations of stimulus size can affect the local advantage so far observed in this New World monkey species. An overall local versus global advantage still emerges in capuchins, irrespectively of the amplitude of the visual angle subtended by the hierarchical shapes. Moreover, a local-to-global interference, indicative of a strong local advantage, was observed for the first time. In the second experiment, we manipulated size and numerosity of the local elements of hierarchical patterns, mimicking procedures that in human perception relegate the local elements to texture and enhance a global advantage. Our results show that in capuchin monkeys, a local advantage emerges clearly even when these procedures are used. These results are of interest since extensive neurophysiological research is carried out on non-human primate vision, often taking for granted a similarity of visual skills in human and non-human primates. These behavioural results show that this assumption is not always warranted and that more research is needed to clarify the differences in the processes involved in basic visual skills among primates.","Previous studies suggest that monkeys process local elements of hierarchical visual patterns more quickly and more accurately than they process the global shape.

"The main purpose of the study was to compare behavioural properties of entrainment to photic (30 min; 200lx) and nonphotic (melatonin: 1 h; 100 microg) stimuli in the diurnal rodent Arvicanthis ansorgei. Male animals (n=38) were used, and running wheel activity was recorded. Following entrainment to 12:12 h LD the animals were transferred to DD (dim red light) to freerun before treatment started. A phase response curve (PRC) to light was determined showing a phase delay region in the early subjective night (CT 8-16) and a phase advance region in the late subjective night (CT 18-4). Activity onset defined CT=0. Entrainment to daily phase advance and phase delay light pulses occurred at circadian phases corresponding to the respective phase shift regions of the PRC. Similarly, also entrainment to daily melatonin pulses occurred in two narrow time windows located near the beginning (CT 0) and the end of the subjective day (CT 10), but where light had a phase advance effect melatonin had a phase delay effect and vice versa. These results are consistent with the neurobiological model of Hastings et al. (Chronobiol Int 1998;15:425-445) on the differential effects of photic and nonphotic resetting cues on the circadian pacemaker.",The main purpose of the study was to compare behavioural properties of entrainment to photic (30 min; 200lx) and nonphotic (melatonin: 1 h; 100 microg) stimuli in the diurnal rodent Arvicanthis ansorgei.,"Male animals (n=38) were used, and running wheel activity was recorded.

"The submerged platform or Morris water escape task is widely used to study genetic variation in spatial learning and memory, but interpretation is sometimes difficult because of wall hugging, jumping off the platform, floating or non-spatial swim strategies. We modified the task by introducing four wide arms into the circular tank and adding features that reduced, eliminated, or compensated for several competing behaviors. Three versions of the 4-arm task were evaluated in detail, and the third version yielded good results for six of eight inbred strains. Furthermore, the 4-arm task could be scored adequately without computerized video tracking. Although performance on the 4-arm task was generally superior to the Morris maze, the extent of the improvement was strain dependent. Two strains with retinal degeneration (C3H/HeJ, FVB/NJ) performed poorly on both the Morris and 4-arm mazes, whereas C57BL/6J and DBA/2J did well on both mazes. A/J performed poorly on the Morris task but became very proficient on the 4-arm maze, despite its strong tendency to hug the walls of the tank. The BALB/cByJ strain, on the other hand, exhibited the best probe trial performance on the Morris maze but was very slow in acquiring the 4-arm task. We conclude that no single task can reveal the full richness of spatially guided behavior in a wide range of mouse genotypes.","The submerged platform or Morris water escape task is widely used to study genetic variation in spatial learning and memory, but interpretation is sometimes difficult because of wall hugging, jumping off the platform, floating or non-spatial swim strategies.","We modified the task by introducing four wide arms into the circular tank and adding features that reduced, eliminated, or compensated for several competing behaviors.

"Behavioural habituation to a novel environment is a simple form of learning in rodents. We studied the habituation and locomotor activity (LMA) of Wistar rats subjected to unilateral, transient (30min) extradural compression (EC) of the right sensorimotor cortex. One group of rats was tested every 24h during the first 5 days (D1-D5) post-EC. Two other groups were tested for the first time in the LMA boxes on D3 and D6 post-EC and their performance was compared with the group tested on D1 (activity in a novel environment). Total and center locomotion, vertical activity and time spent in the center of the LMA box were reduced on D1 post-EC and normalized by D2. The EC-induced motor paresis was undetectable on the rotarod by D2 and on the beam-walking by D3. Total locomotion, vertical activity and time spent in the center of EC-rats significantly increased from D1 to D3. EC caused neurodegeneration in the cortex, caudate putamen and thalamus as detected by Fluoro-Jade staining. The size of the cortical damage decreased from D2 to D5 in the medial and caudal regions of the compressed hemisphere, in accordance with recovery of motor function. LMA provided additional information in the follow-up of recovery from brain injury and habituation to the environment. Thus, long-term, inter-session habituation was impaired from D1 to D3 but dissociated from increased LMA intra-session on D3, when the motor deficits provoked by EC were already undetectable in the rotarod and beam-walking tests.","Behavioural habituation to a novel environment is a simple form of learning in rodents.

"Lateral shifts in overt attention have been previously shown to modulate reaction times to lateral electrocutaneous stimuli, as well as perception or unpleasantness thresholds. A response bias can play a role in the elicitation of these lateral differences. Therefore, the present experiment aimed at investigating whether eye orientation induces a decision bias in favour of the ipsilateral hemispace. Participants were asked whether or not they suspected subliminal electrocutaneous shocks, whereas no subliminal stimulation was actually delivered. A secondary visual task led participants to direct their eyes ipsi- or contralateral to the stimulated area. Differences between experimental conditions in the amount of subliminal shocks participants acknowledge to receive (number of positive responses) are thought to reflect decision biases. Low and high trait anxiety participants were involved. Results showed an interaction between the eye orientation and the tested hand. The number of positive responses was smaller in right-hand tests with contralateral eye orienting. This effect fits those described previously with real electrocutaneous stimuli. This interaction is related to hemispheric differences in spatial attention. In contrast to thresholds studies, this study failed to replicate that a lateral difference arises in the low but not in the high trait anxiety individuals, suggesting that this interaction was mostly due to the neurosensory processing of the electrocutaneous stimuli.","Lateral shifts in overt attention have been previously shown to modulate reaction times to lateral electrocutaneous stimuli, as well as perception or unpleasantness thresholds.

"Sensory driven immediate early gene expression (IEG) has been a key tool to explore auditory perceptual areas in the avian brain. Most work on IEG expression in songbirds such as zebra finches has focused on playback of acoustic stimuli and its effect on auditory processing areas such as caudal medial mesopallium (CMM) caudal medial nidopallium (NCM). However, in a natural setting, the courtship displays of songbirds (including zebra finches) include visual as well as acoustic components. To determine whether the visual stimulus of a courting male modifies song-induced expression of the IEG ZENK in the auditory forebrain we exposed male and female zebra finches to acoustic (song) and visual (dancing) components of courtship. Birds were played digital movies with either combined audio and video, audio only, video only, or neither audio nor video (control). We found significantly increased levels of Zenk response in the auditory region CMM in the two treatment groups exposed to acoustic stimuli compared to the control group. The video only group had an intermediate response, suggesting potential effect of visual input on activity in these auditory brain regions. Finally, we unexpectedly found a lateralization of Zenk response that was independent of sex, brain region, or treatment condition, such that Zenk immunoreactivity was consistently higher in the left hemisphere than in the right and the majority of individual birds were left-hemisphere dominant.","Sensory driven immediate early gene expression (IEG) has been a key tool to explore auditory perceptual areas in the avian brain.

"In the present study, newborn rats were implanted with corticosterone (CORT) containing polymers at postnatal day 0 (releasing rate 320-80 microg CORT/kg body weight and day). Controls received a CORT-free implant. All implants were removed at postnatal day 12. At the age of 16-20 weeks, these animals were tested for emotional behavior using an elevated plus-maze and fear-sensitized acoustic startle response. On the elevated plus-maze significant differences were found between hormone treated and control animals. The CORT-group demonstrated higher numbers of entries into closed arms and all arms, and the time spent in the center of the maze was significantly enhanced. Hormone-treated and control rats showed a significant fear sensitization of the acoustic startle response. However, no significant differences were observed between the two groups. The number of CRF-immunopositive neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala was decreased after CORT treatment, whereas the number of NPY-immunopositive neurons and total number of neurons in the amygdala did not differ significantly between both groups. In conclusion, early postnatal stress induced by CORT administration in neonatal rats led to a higher locomotor activity correlated with changes in the number of CRF containing neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala.","In the present study, newborn rats were implanted with corticosterone (CORT) containing polymers at postnatal day 0 (releasing rate 320-80 microg CORT/kg body weight and day).

"The habenula and interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) are part of a dorsal diencephalic conduction system which receives input from cholinergic, striatal, and hypothalamic areas, and sends output to several, disparate midbrain regions. These output regions include the dorsal tegmental nucleus, which is part of a navigation-related system that provides a signal for directional heading. The habenula and IPN also project to the dorsal and medial Raphe nuclei, thought to be involved in mood and behavioral state regulation. Here, cells in both the habenula and IPN were recorded in freely moving rats while they foraged for food pellets. There were four major findings. First, many of the cells tended to fire in sporadic bouts of relatively high versus low rates, and this may be related to intrinsic cell properties discovered during in vitro studies. Second, although these regions are connected to the direction signaling circuit, they do not, themselves demonstrate a directional signal. Third, about 10% of the cells in the lateral habenula showed a strong correlation between rate and angular head motion. This may constitute an important, requisite input to the above-mentioned head direction circuit. Finally, many of the cells in each region showed a temporally coarse correlation with running speed, so that bouts of high frequency firing coincided with episodes of higher behavioral activation. This last finding may be related to work which shows an influence of the habenula on locomotor activity, and in relation to the protective effects of exercise in relation to stress, as mediated by the Raphe nuclei.","The habenula and interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) are part of a dorsal diencephalic conduction system which receives input from cholinergic, striatal, and hypothalamic areas, and sends output to several, disparate midbrain regions.

Second, although these regions are connected to the direction signaling circuit, they demonstrate a directional signal themselves. Third, about 10% of the cells in the lateral habenula showed a strong correlation between rate and angular head motion. This may constitute an important, requisite input to the above-mentioned head direction circuit. Finally, many of the cells in each region showed a temporally coarse correlation with running speed, so that bouts of high frequency firing coincided with episodes of higher behavioral activation. This last finding may be related to work which shows an influence of the habenula on locomotor activity, and in relation to the protective effects of exercise in relation to stress, as mediated by the Raphe nuclei."
"Glutathione is the major non-protein thiol to which many different roles in the central nervous system (CNS) are attributed. To further investigate the glutathione response in the CNS, we tested the effect of three stress models on glutathione levels in the brain. We tested the effect of two models of repeated intraspecific agonistic interaction in mice. No influence was observed over the glutathione levels in the mice cerebral cortex, cerebellum, liver, and blood. Acute restraint stress in rats was found to induce an increase in glutathione levels in the cerebellum after 2 and 4 h of immobilization, an effect not observed in the cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. To investigate the interference of an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), N(omega)Nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester (L-NAME, 50 mg/kg) was applied i.p. at the beginning of restraint stress. L-NAME alone did not lead to a change in glutathione levels although, in combination with restraint stress, it induced an increase in such levels. This effect was observed in all four structures studied, i.e. cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum. The values returned to basal levels after 6h of immobilization. In conclusion, the pattern of dominance, after repeated intraspecific agonistic interaction, was ineffective in producing alterations in brain glutathione, whereas acute restraint stress led to an increase in glutathione levels within a window of 2-4 h, and the inhibition of NOS increased glutathione levels in all studied rat brain structures, suggesting a specificity interference of acute restraint stress with the glutathione system.","Glutathione is the major non-protein thiol to which many different roles in the central nervous system (CNS) are attributed.

"Peripheral neuropathies increase with aging, and reactive oxygen species contribute to the symptomatology of neuropathic pain disorders. In this study, we examined age-related differences in the therapeutic efficacy of pre- or post-treatments of the amino-steroidal antioxidant 16-desmethyltirilazad in delaying the onset and/or limiting the duration of tactile-evoked allodynia following the induction of peripheral mononeuropathies in rats. Two different models of nerve injury were utilized to induce allodynia in young and aged rats: (1) the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of Bennett and Xie [Bennett GJ, Xie Y-K. A peripheral mononeuropathy in rat that produces disorders of pain sensation like those seen in man. Pain 1988;33:87-107]; (2) the partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL) model of Seltzer et al. [Seltzer Z, Dubner R, Shir YA. Novel behavioral model of neuropathic pain disorders produced in rats by partial sciatic nerve injury. Pain 1990;43:205-18]. Calibrated von Frey filaments were used to examine changes in paw withdrawal threshold values. The results demonstrated that pre-treating young and aged rats with 16-desmethyltirilazad prior to the induction of peripheral mononeuropathies prevented the onset of neuropathic pain. However, once post-operative tactile allodynia was established, post-treatment therapy was ineffective at reversing the symptoms. These findings support the mediatory role of reactive oxygen species in neuropathic pain disorders, and suggest that the antiallodynic efficacy of antioxidant intervention is dependent on the time course of administration.","Peripheral neuropathies increase with aging, and reactive oxygen species contribute to the symptomatology of neuropathic pain disorders.","In this study, we examined age-related differences in the therapeutic efficacy of pre- or post-treatments of the amino-steroidal antioxidant 16-desmethyltirilazad in delaying the onset and/or limiting the duration of tactile-evoked allodynia following the induction of peripheral mononeuropathies in rats.

"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) plays important roles in both embryonic development as a mediator of neurogenesis and in the mature brain as a neurotransmitter. Disturbances in serotonergic transmission have been indicated in several psychiatric disorders. In the search for the biological substrates of psychiatric diseases, studies using animal models represent complementary approaches to studies on human subjects. Wistar-Zagreb 5HT rats, with constitutionally upregulated/downregulated platelet 5HT transporter (termed high- and low-5HT rats, respectively), have been developed in our laboratory as a model for studying various aspects of 5HT function. In this work, we have searched for potential behavioral differences between Wistar-Zagreb 5HT rat sublines in three anxiety paradigms: hole-board, zero-maze, and social interaction test. In all three tests, significant differences in behavior between Wistar-Zagreb 5HT sublines have been observed, indicating higher levels of anxiety-related behavior in high-5HT rats. In the social interaction test, high-5HT animals spent less time in active contact with conspecifics and displayed a narrower spectrum of social behaviors than their low-5HT counterparts, while in the zero-maze and hole-board tasks, they showed a lower level of exploratory activity (head dips and nose pokes) in comparison to low-5HT rats. On the other hand, thigmotactic behavior (the percentage of time spent in open quadrants of zero-maze and the percentage of central holes visited in hole-board) did not differ between the sublines. The results suggest that as a result of selection process, a specific component of anxiety-related behavior (i.e. exploratory activity directed towards a novel environment and conspecifics) has been affected in Wistar-Zagreb 5HT rats.","Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) plays important roles in both embryonic development as a mediator of neurogenesis and in the mature brain as a neurotransmitter.

"Rearing rats in isolation produces behavioural and neurochemical alterations similar to those observed in schizophrenia. Cannabinoids have also been implicated in inducing psychotic symptoms. In this study, we investigate the effect of the major psychoactive constituent of cannabis and partial cannabinoid CB(1) receptor agonist Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on prepulse inhibition (%PPI) of the acoustic startle reflex and on habituation in socially isolated and grouped rats. Deficits in %PPI are reminiscent of sensorimotor gating deficits observed in psychoses. Male Sprague-Dawley rat pups (21 days old) were housed in either single cages (isolated) or in group cages of six per cage (grouped). Eight weeks later the effect of vehicle, THC and the CB(1) receptor antagonist SR 141716 on %PPI was tested. Vehicle treated isolated rats exhibited significantly reduced PPI compared with grouped rats. Isolated rats treated with THC had significantly lower %PPI than vehicle treated groups. This further decrease of %PPI by THC was reversed by pre-treatment with SR 141716, indicating that this effect was mediated by CB(1) receptors. THC had no significant effect on %PPI in grouped rats. SR 141716 had no significant effect on %PPI in either grouped or isolated rats. Habituation did not significantly alter in any treatment group in any treatment group. These results suggest that THC produces significant decreases in sensorimotor gating in rats with already dysfunctional sensorimotor gating processes, but not in normal rats.

"Neurocognitive impairment has consistently been considered a central and stable feature of schizophrenia. There is much controversy about the effects of neuroleptics on neurocognitive deficits. Thus, further investigations are needed to clarify the pathological substrate of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia as well as to identify pharmacological tools for treatment. Transient prenatal Vitamin D deficiency is considered a developmental model in schizophrenia research. Recently, it was reported that prenatal Vitamin D-depleted rats showed a habituation deficit in the hole board. Here, we tested the effect on hole board habituation of haloperidol (Hal, 0.075 mg/kg, i.p.), risperidone (Ris, 0.2 mg/kg, i.p.) and the mGluR5 agonist CHPG (0.1 mg, i.c.v.) after subchronic treatment. Hal was found to impair habituation in control animals, Ris restored hole board habituation, whereas Hal and CHPG normalised hole board habituation in the deplete animals completely. The results of the study demonstrate that (i) the Vitamin D model might be a valuable tool in the study of neurodevelopmental aspects of schizophrenia, (ii) the model is sensitive in detecting the effect of antipsychotic drugs and (iii) the model appears to be sensitive in differentiating between typical and atypical antipsychotic drug.","Neurocognitive impairment has consistently been considered a central and stable feature of schizophrenia.

"In vertebrates, circulating androgen levels are regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis through which the brain controls the gonads via the pituitary. Androgen levels ultimately depend on factors including season, temperature, social circumstance, age, and other variables related to reproductive capacity and opportunity. Previous studies with an African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, suggested that changes in both testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), an androgen specific to teleost fish, depend on male social status. Here we characterize circulating plasma concentrations of testosterone and 11-KT in socially dominant (territorial) and socially subordinate (non-territorial) males. Territorial males have significantly higher circulating levels of both forms of androgen, which is another defining difference between dominant and subordinate males in this species. These results underscore how internal and external cues related to reproduction are integrated at the level of the HPG axis.","In vertebrates, circulating androgen levels are regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis through which the brain controls the gonads via the pituitary.

"Most odorants we experience in every day life are bimodal in that they activate both the main olfactory and the intranasal trigeminal system. Few studies have investigated whether true bimodal odorants are processed differently than unimodal odorants. The aim of the study was to address sex-dependent hemispheric differences in olfactory event-related potentials. Event-related potentials (ERP) of the bimodal stimulant peppermint oil were recorded in 34 healthy subjects (17 women). No sex-related differences in olfactory sensitivity, trigeminal sensitivity or hedonic ratings of the stimuli were found. Although perceived similarly by men and women, results indicated a sex-differentiated hemispheric response to bimodal odors. Women generally expressed larger amplitudes and longer latencies over their left hemisphere, whereas men demonstrated a similar pattern over their right hemisphere.

"The pyramidal CA1 neurons of the hippocampus are critically involved in spatial learning and memory. These neurons are especially vulnerable to cerebral ischemia, but in spite of this, it has been consistently difficult to show any learning and memory deficits in two-vessel occlusion models of global ischemia. Transient global ischemia was induced in adult male rats under general anaesthesia administered by artificial respiration to prevent respiratory arrest. Systemic blood pressure was reduced to below 50 mmHg by instant adjustments of the halothane concentration, before and during bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries. Cerebral blood flow was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry. Dying neurons were detected by TUNEL at 14 days after ischemia and surviving neurons by NeuN at 14 and 125 days after ischemia. Learning and memory was assessed in a novel water maze with three successive left-right choices. Transient global ischemia produced a profound and selective degeneration of CA1 neurons at 14 days after ischemia. This degeneration was associated with severe impairments in learning at 13 days after ischemia and in memory, as tested 24 h afterwards. At 125 days after ischemia, there was no significant learning and memory impairment, whereas the number of CA1 neurons was increased. These results show that transient global ischemia induced by two-vessel occlusion may lead to severe, but transient, impairments in learning and memory using a novel water maze, and that restored learning and memory is associated with an increased number of CA1 neurons.","The pyramidal CA1 neurons of the hippocampus are critically involved in spatial learning and memory.

"Steroids are generally viewed as transcription factors binding to intracellular receptors and activating gene transcription. Rapid cellular effects mediated via non-genomic mechanisms have however been identified and one report showed that injections of estradiol rapidly stimulate chemoinvestigation and mounting behavior in castrated male rats. It is not known whether such effects take place in other species and what are the cellular underlying mechanisms. We show here that a single injection of estradiol (500 microg/kg) rapidly and transiently activates copulatory behavior in castrated male quail pre-treated with a dose of testosterone behaviorally ineffective by itself. The maximal behavioral effect was observed after 15 min. In a second experiment, the brain of all subjects was immediately collected after behavioral tests performed 15 min after injection. The preoptic area--hypothalamus (HPOA), hindbrain, telencephalon and cerebellum were isolated and monoamines measured by HPLC-ED. Estradiol increased levels of the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and 5-HIAA/serotonin ratios in the telencephalon and hindbrain independently of whether animals had mated or not. Estradiol also affected these measures in HPOA and cerebellum but this effect was correlated with the level of sexual activity so that significant effects of the treatment only appeared when sexual activity was used as a covariate.

"The sensitization of animal models of anxiety is of great importance to detect potential anxiolytic drugs. Our goal was to evaluate the influence of manipulations of the light/dark cycle on the basal anxious behaviour of mice and the efficacy of two anxiolytic treatments in the mouse elevated plus maze (EPM). Male Swiss mice were exposed to different conditions of illumination for one week prior to testing. In the first experiment of the study, we evaluated the anxiolytic effects of diazepam, at the dose of 1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered 30 min before the test. In the second experiment, we examined the effects of WAY 100635, a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, at the doses of 0.03 and 2 mg/kg, i.p. administered 30 min before the test. The locomotor activity of control mice and the anxiolytic efficacy of diazepam in the EPM were not affected by manipulation of the light/dark cycle. Conversely, the effects of WAY 100635, which were qualitatively different from those of diazepam, seemed to be influenced by the illumination conditions imposed before the test. We can conclude that diazepam's effect, which is characterized by a strong ""disinhibition"", was more robust than the 5-HT(1A) antagonist's effect, which was more anxioselective.

"State-dependent learning (SDL) is a phenomenon in which the retrieval of newly acquired information is possible if the subject is in the same physiological state as during the encoding phase. SDL makes it possible to separate the effects of drugs per se on learning from the effects due to changes in drug state during the task. The present work was designed to investigate whether the antidepressants amitriptyline (30 mg/kg), maprotiline (25 mg/kg), and fluoxetine (15 mg/kg) produce SDL of the inhibitory avoidance conditioning in male and female CD1 mice. In three separate experiments, independent groups were used for each pharmacological treatment and for each sex using a 2 x 2 experimental design. The results do not show SDL in any of the drugs. In the case of amitriptilyline, the data can be attributed to a memorization deficit, while the maprotiline results are interpreted as simultaneously influenced by memorization deficit and performance facilitation due to motor impairment. Fluoxetine treatment did not produce any deteriorating effect on the conditioning. Drugs had some different effects on the performance of males and females, males showing a slightly higher deterioration than females with administration of amitriptyline and maprotiline. This study shows that these antidepressants affect the acquisition/consolidation but not the retrieval process in the inhibitory avoidance learning.",State-dependent learning (SDL) is a phenomenon in which the retrieval of newly acquired information is possible if the subject is in the same physiological state as during the encoding phase.

"The ovarian steroids, estrogen (E) and progesterone (P), have been shown to affect anxiety and fear in humans and animals, although with inconsistent results. These ambiguous findings may be due to differential actions of ovarian steroids on anxiety versus fear. To investigate such a role, we used the open field test (OFT) and fear-potentiated startle (FPS). We examined these behaviors between cycling female rats in proestrus (high E and rising P) or diestrus (low E and P), as well as between ovariectomized rats treated for 2 weeks with placebo, E, or E plus P (OVX, OVX/E, OVX/EP, respectively). We found no differences in anxiety-like or fear behaviors in OFT or FPS between proestrus and diestrus rats, perhaps due to the opposing effects of E and P. In contrast, we found that the OVX/E rats spent more time in the center of the OFT compared to the OVX and OVX/EP rats with no difference in overall activity level, suggesting that E reduced anxiety and this was opposed by P. With FPS, the OVX/E rats showed increased startle in the first third of the testing session, followed by a rapid decline in startle magnitude in subsequent trials. The addition of P to E treatment counteracted this effect. In conclusion, E may have differential effects on specific components of anxiety and fear; E may decrease anxiety in a naturalistic environment, but intensify both fear learning and extinction processes. P antagonizes these E effects on anxiety and fear.","The ovarian steroids, estrogen (E) and progesterone (P), have been shown to affect anxiety and fear in humans and animals, although with inconsistent results.

"Intraventricular injections of the tachykinin NK3 receptor (NK3-R) agonist, senktide, suppress the ingestion of hypertonic (0.5 M) NaCl by decreasing the initial lick rate and accelerating the decay in lick rate in sodium deficient rats. The present experiment examined whether the effects of intraventricular injections of senktide on lick rate were selective for NaCl solution, or if the ability of NK3-R agonists to inhibit intake generalizes other sodium-containing solutions. The effects of lateral ventricular injections of isotonic saline or senktide (200 ng) on intake and lick rate of 0.5 M solutions of sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium acetate (Na acetate), sodium bicarbonate (Na bicarbonate), and monosodium glutamate (MSG) were measured in sodium deficient rats. Compared to saline injection, senktide injection had no effect on the lick rate or intake of Na bicarbonate. In contrast, intraventricular injection of senktide suppressed the intake of NaCl, Na acetate, and MSG compared to saline injection. Senktide injection accelerated the decay in lick rate for NaCl, Na acetate and MSG, but only suppressed the initial lick rate for NaCl and Na acetate. The results show that activation of NK3-R in sodium deficient rats suppresses the intake of tastes that are classified as ""salty"" tasting and that the decrease in intake reflects effects on the initial lick rate, the decay in lick rate, or both.","Intraventricular injections of the tachykinin NK3 receptor (NK3-R) agonist, senktide, suppress the ingestion of hypertonic (0.5 M) NaCl by decreasing the initial lick rate and accelerating the decay in lick rate in sodium deficient rats.

"The present study examines the temporal features of overt and covert actions as a function of normal aging. In the first experiment, we tested three motor tasks (walking, sit-stand-sit, arm pointing) that did not imply any particular spatiotemporal constraints, and we compared the duration of their overt and covert execution in three different groups of age (mean ages: 22.5, 66.2 and 73.4 years). We found that the ability of generating motor images did not differentiate elderly subjects from young subjects. Precisely, regarding overt and covert durations, subjects presented similarities for the walking and pointing tasks and dissimilarities for the stand-sit-stand task. Furthermore, the timing variability of imagined movements was always greater compared to actual movements and was of the same amount in the three groups of age. In the second experiment, we investigated the effect of age (three groups with mean ages: 22, 64.8 and 73.2 years) upon temporal characteristics of covert and overt movements involving strong spatiotemporal constraints (speed/accuracy trade-off paradigm). During overt execution young and elderly subjects respected Fitts's law despite the fact that movement speed progressively decreased with age. Thus, while execution is deteriorated, the motor preparation process is still intact in old age, and follows well-known laws of biological motions. For covert execution, movement speed progressively decreased with age but elderly subjects did not respect Fitts's law. This suggests that the generation and control of motor intentions that consciously do not come to execution, particularly those concerning complex motor actions are progressively perturbed in the aging brain.",The present study examines the temporal features of overt and covert actions as a function of normal aging.,"In the first experiment, we tested three motor tasks (walking, sit-stand-sit, arm pointing) that did not imply any particular spatiotemporal constraints, and we compared the duration of their overt and covert execution in three different groups of age (mean ages: 22.5, 66.2 and 73.4 years).

"Some rats of the WAG/Rij (Wistar Albino Glaxo from Rijswijk) and Wistar strain are susceptible for audiogenic (convulsive) seizures. In the present study, behavior of susceptible and non-susceptible rats from the WAG/Rij strain, genetically predisposed to absence epilepsy, and outbred Wistar strain, genetically not predisposed to absence epilepsy, was compared to assess the level of anxiety (in the open field, light-dark choice and elevated plus-maze tests) and the level of depression (in the sucrose consumption and forced swimming tests). Increased level of anxiety was found only in audiogenic susceptible rats both from WAG/Rij and Wistar strain, but increased level of depression was found only in WAG/Rij rats independently of their susceptibility to audiogenic seizures. The results suggest that enhanced level of depression in WAG/Rij strain rats is associated with absence epilepsy but enhanced level of anxiety with susceptibility to audiogenic seizures.","Some rats of the WAG/Rij (Wistar Albino Glaxo from Rijswijk) and Wistar strain are susceptible for audiogenic (convulsive) seizures.

"Rats are one of the most commonly used species for spinal cord injury research. Since the advent of the Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale, the majority of spinal cord injury research relies upon evaluating locomotor behaviour in thoracic spinal cord injury rat models. Slightly more than 50% of all traumatic spinal cord injuries in humans, however, occur at the level of the cervical spinal cord. Further, therapies aimed at thoracic spinal cord injuries may not be directly transferable to cervical spinal cord injuries. This could be due to (1) differences in distance between the cell bodies of injured axons and the injury site and (2) because some behaviours (e.g. stepping movements) used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of a given treatment are governed primarily by intraspinal neuronal circuitry while other behaviours (e.g. skilled reaching) require more sophisticated conscious integration of the sensorimotor system. Consequently, there is a need to develop and use experimental cervical spinal cord injury models and understand the behavioural characteristics of such models. The present review highlights the sensorimotor abilities of cervical spinal cord-injured rats, including both forelimb, hind limb, and whole body behaviours. We also provide insight into the neuroanatomic substrates important for performing a given behaviour, information which may prove essential in the development of site-directed therapeutic strategies.","Rats are one of the most commonly used species for spinal cord injury research.

"Following confinement to one chamber of a two-chamber exploration box (acquisition trial), male and female rats were intraperitoneally injected with saline, glucose (50, 100 mg/kg) or tacrine (1, 3 mg/kg). Twenty-four hours later they were given free access to this chamber and an identical novel one (retention trial). Tendencies to occupy the novel chamber (novelty-related location preferences) were increased by both doses of glucose for females and by the higher dose for males. While neither dose of tacrine affected this response for females, increased preferences occurred for males following the higher dose. However, when the higher doses of both agents were administered 2 h after acquisition, there were no significant effects for either sex. In view of the rats' lack of significant preferences for the novel chamber when treated with saline both immediately and 2 h after acquisition, the results were interpreted as sex-dependent attenuation of forgetting by post-acquisition treatment with both agents.","Following confinement to one chamber of a two-chamber exploration box (acquisition trial), male and female rats were intraperitoneally injected with saline, glucose (50, 100 mg/kg) or tacrine (1, 3 mg/kg).

"Inbred mouse strains have different genetic backgrounds that can result in impairment of synaptic plasticity and memory. Strain-dependent performance in behavioral and cognitive tasks is well-documented. Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), an activity-dependent enhancement of synaptic transmission that may underlie some forms of learning and memory has been shown to differ significantly between inbred mouse strains. However, an effect of strain on the expression of proteins, critically involved in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory has not been described yet. We have been addressing this question by determining expressional levels of a panel of proteins involved in neuronal information processing in hippocampus of five mouse strains by immunoblotting. Four inbred strains (FVB/N, C57Bl/6J, 129S2/Sv and Balb/c), commonly used for generating genetically modified mice and for conventional experiments in pharmacology and toxicology and one outbred strain (OF1) have been selected. A significant effect of strain was detected for total and phosphorylated calcium-calmodulin dependent kinase IIalpha (CaMKII, pCaMKII), phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (pMAPK), total and phosphorylated calcium-responsive element binding 1 (creb, pcreb), early-growth response protein 1 (egr 1), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), drebrin and postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95).

"The role of directional compatibility was investigated during the production of in-phase and anti-phase coordination patterns involving the four limbs as well as the head. Our first aim was to compare the quality of interlimb coordination between concordant and discordant coordination patterns across girdles at different cycling frequencies. Concordant implied adoption of either the in-phase or anti-phase coordination mode across both girdles whereas discordant implied a combination of both modes. The second aim was to study the effect of periodic head movements upon the assembling of a coordinative synergy among the limbs. Findings revealed that concordant coordination modes were produced with higher accuracy and consistency than discordant coordination modes and this effect was more distinct at higher cycling frequencies. Inclusion of head movements was found to destabilize in-phase coordination but stabilize anti-phase coordination patterns, particularly during discordant conditions at higher cycling frequencies. This observation contrasts with previous findings in which anti-phase modes have invariably been shown to be more vulnerable to experimental perturbations than in-phase modes. The findings are discussed within the context of the coalition of egocentric and allocentric constraints during multilimb coordination and the role of direction as an organizing principle in movement control.",The role of directional compatibility was investigated during the production of in-phase and anti-phase coordination patterns involving the four limbs as well as the head.

"Spontaneous development of lupus-like disease in MRL-lpr mice is accompanied by a constellation of behavioral deficits, including blunted responsiveness to sucrose. Although autoimmunity-induced damage of limbic areas is proposed to underlie this deficit, the systemic nature of the disease precludes inference of a causal relationship between CNS damage and functional loss. Based on the stimulatory effects of d-amphetamine sulfate (AMPH) on sucrose intake, the present study pharmacologically probes the functional status of central dopaminergic circuits involved in control of behavioral reward. The response rates were compared between diseased MRL-lpr mice and congenic MRL +/+ controls tested in the sucrose preference paradigm. Neuronal loss was assessed by Fluoro Jade B (FJB) staining of nucleus accumbens and the CA2/CA3 region. While control mice significantly increased intake of sucrose solutions 60 min after administration of AMPH (i.p., 0.5 mg/kg), the intake in drugged MRL-lpr mice was comparable to those given saline injection. Increased FJB staining was detected in the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus of diseased mice, and AMPH treatment neither altered this nor other measures of organ pathology. The results obtained are consistent with previously observed changes in the mesolimbic dopamine system of MRL-lpr mice and suggest that the lesion in the nucleus accumbens and deficits in dopamine release underlie impaired responsiveness to palatable stimulation during the progress of systemic autoimmune disease. As such, they point to a neurotransmitter-specific regional brain damage which may account for depressive behaviors in neuropsychiatric lupus erythematosus.","Spontaneous development of lupus-like disease in MRL-lpr mice is accompanied by a constellation of behavioral deficits, including blunted responsiveness to sucrose.

"Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) has been implicated in ischemia-induced neurotoxicity, due in part to excitatory effects at the hippocampus, and the demonstrated neuroprotective effects of centrally administered, non-specific CRH antagonists. However, a number of issues remain to be clarified from these studies, including the relative contribution of CRH receptor subtypes, and the efficacy of these compounds to alter ischemia-induced behavioral impairments. In the current study, a highly selective, systemically administered CRH1 antagonist (CP154,526) failed to reverse global ischemia-induced cell death in hippocampal CA1 neurons or spatial memory impairments as assessed in the radial arm maze. Similarly, central administration of alpha-helical CRH failed to confer protection against ischemic damage. Interestingly, CRH1 antagonism reversed ischemia-induced hyperactivity in a novel open field, suggesting that modulation of this behavior is independent of effects on hippocampal CA1 cell loss. Failure of the current study to demonstrate neuroprotective effects of either the selective or non-selective CRH antagonists tested challenges the proposed neurotoxic role of CRH in global ischemia. These findings are discussed in relationship to recent findings reconsidering the participation of CRH in excitotoxic-mediated cellular damage.","Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) has been implicated in ischemia-induced neurotoxicity, due in part to excitatory effects at the hippocampus, and the demonstrated neuroprotective effects of centrally administered, non-specific CRH antagonists.

"The long-term effects on isolation-induced aggressive behaviour and central NGF and BDNF levels of gestational exposures to ozone (O(3)) were evaluated in adult CD-1 mice. Females were exposed to O(3), at the dose of 0.0, 0.3 or 0.6 ppm from 30 days prior the formation of breeding pairs until gestational day 17. Litters were fostered at birth to untreated dams and, at adulthood, male offspring underwent five successive daily encounters (15 min each) with a standard opponent of the same strain, sex, weight and age.

"In order to study spatial cognition as well as operant/instrumental conditioning or attention processes in the same experimental context in mice, we have designed and constructed an operant chamber that contains a large number of nose poke holes distributed over its inner walls. The nose poke holes were placed three in a horizontal row on one left wall, five in a form of an X on the front wall, and three in a vertical column on one right wall in a hexagonal shaped chamber. This organization of nose poke holes was intended to provide mice with spatially structured environmental cues. Here, we report on an experiment in which providing additional structuring to the standard condition, favoring either further spatial grouping or perceptual/visual clustering of subsets of holes, tremendously facilitated nose poke discrimination learning in normal C57BL/6 mice. More interestingly, mice were able to use their (spatial or mental) representation of holes organization elaborated under spatially or visually structured environment, to improve their learning of a new discrimination under the standard less-structured environment. These findings support the idea that mice are sensitive to subtle visual background information, in addition to spatial information, to organize nose poke items, process similar to both pattern separation and chunking process, in order to minimize interference and to increase items discriminability and their capacity for (long-term) memory.","In order to study spatial cognition as well as operant/instrumental conditioning or attention processes in the same experimental context in mice, we have designed and constructed an operant chamber that contains a large number of nose poke holes distributed over its inner walls.

"Several studies suggest that emotional arousal can promote memory storage. In this study, we evaluated the effects of emotional content on declarative memory, utilizing an adaptation of two versions of the same story, with different arousing properties (neutral or emotional), which have been already employed in experiments involving the enhancing effects of emotions on memory retention. We used event related potentials (ERP) to evaluate whether there is a sex-related hemispheric lateralization of electrical potentials elicited by the emotional content of a story. We compared left and right hemisphere P300 waves, recorded in P3 and P4 electrode sites, in response to emotional or neutral stimuli in men and women. In the left hemisphere, emotional stimuli elicited a stronger P300 in women, compared to men, as indexed by both amplitude and latency measures; moreover, the emotional content of the story elicited a stronger P300 in the right hemisphere in men than in women. The better memory for the arousal material may be related to the differential P300 at encoding. These data indicate that both sex and cerebral hemisphere constitute important, interacting influences on neural correlates of emotion, and of emotionally influenced memory.",Several studies suggest that emotional arousal can promote memory storage.,"In this study, we evaluated the effects of emotional content on declarative memory, utilizing an adaptation of two versions of the same story, with different arousing properties (neutral or emotional), which have been already employed in experiments involving the enhancing effects of emotions on memory retention.

"Progesterone receptor (PR) activation can modulate the expression of male sexual behavior, both acutely in adulthood as well as during development, through long lasting effects on neural differentiation. One mechanism by which PR activation may affect behavior, during either epoch of life, is through alterations of the dopaminergic system. We investigated the effects of PR deletion on the sensitivity of sexual behavior to dopamine antagonism in male wild-type (WT) and progesterone receptor knockout (PRKO) mice and found that WT mice were more behaviorally sensitive to the effects of dopamine D1 receptor blockade. There were also genotype differences in tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactivity (TH-ir) in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) as well as genotype differences in how TH expression changed in response to social and sexual experience. In particular, in the VTA, sexually experienced PRKO mice had significantly more cells expressing TH than sexually experienced WT mice. In the SNc, experienced PRKO males had significantly more cells expressing TH than naive PRKO males. Thus, it appears that PR deletion affects the display of sexual behavior and its modulation by dopamine, as well as the differentiation of dopaminergic cells and the plasticity of those cells in response to social environment and behavioral experience.","Progesterone receptor (PR) activation can modulate the expression of male sexual behavior, both acutely in adulthood as well as during development, through long lasting effects on neural differentiation.

"The production of specific antibodies (IgG), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was evaluated in dogs in relation to behavioural lateralisation as assessed by paw preference. Left-handed, right-handed and ambidextrous dogs of mixed breed were selected on the basis of their performance in a task consisting of the removal of a piece of adhesive paper from the snout. All dogs were immunised with rabies vaccine. IgG anti-rabies antibody response was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) test. Serum IFN-gamma and IL-10 levels were measured by ELISA in animals showing significant individual left-, right- or no-paw preferences in the behavioural test. The results showed that the direction of behavioural lateralisation influenced the immune response in dogs. The titers of anti-rabies antibodies were lower in left-pawed dogs than in right-pawed and ambidextrous dogs. Similarly, the IFN-gamma serum levels were lower in left-pawed dogs than in right-pawed and ambidextrous dogs. IL-10, on the contrary, seemed to be an immune parameter, which was not affected by lateralisation. These findings suggest that immunomodulation can be correlated with brain laterality in canine species by the regulation of the production of antibodies and some cytokines like IFN-gamma, which are molecules involved in the immune-neurohumoral crosstalk.","The production of specific antibodies (IgG), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was evaluated in dogs in relation to behavioural lateralisation as assessed by paw preference.

"Increased psychophysiological resistance to chronic stress has been related to increased 5-HT release in the dorsal hippocampus. This study investigated the changes in 5-HT release and turnover in the hippocampus evoked by acute and repeated exposure to an inescapable stressor, an elevated open platform, and compared them to the changes evoked in the frontal cortex. Repeated exposure to this stressor results in habituation of the plasma corticosterone response to the test, with full habituation being observed after 20 trials. Repeated exposure to the stressor for 5 or 10 occasions increased 5-HT turnover in the hippocampus. By contrast, 5-HT turnover in frontal cortex was increased by acute exposure to the stressor. Microdialysis studies showed that acute stress increased 5-HT overflow in prefrontal cortex but not dorsal hippocampus whereas repeated daily (10 days) exposure to the stressor increased basal extracellular 5-HT in the dorsal hippocampus, but not the prefrontal cortex. Prior exposure to the stressor on up to 10 occasions enhanced the plasma corticosterone response to a challenge in an elevated plus-maze performed 24h later whereas repeated, but not acute, exposure to the stressor, elicited anxiolytic-like behavioural responses in this test. It is concluded that acute exposure to this form of inescapable stress selectively stimulates the 5-HT projections to the frontal cortex; repeated stress elicits a sustained increase in 5-HT release and turnover in the hippocampus. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that increased 5-HT release in the hippocampus may be implicated in the mechanisms underlying habituation to inescapable stress.",Increased psychophysiological resistance to chronic stress has been related to increased 5-HT release in the dorsal hippocampus.,"This study investigated the changes in 5-HT release and turnover in the hippocampus evoked by acute and repeated exposure to an inescapable stressor, an elevated open platform, and compared them to the changes evoked in the frontal cortex.

"A non-predictive peripheral cueing paradigm was used to evaluate visuospatial attentional deficits in symptomatic HD patients, employing spatially valid and invalid visual cues over a range of stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) to elicit a saccadic response. Although both patients and controls demonstrated initial facilitation for valid versus invalid cues following the shortest SOA, and a performance decrement (inhibition of return), at the longest SOA, a clear differentiation between these groups was found for the intermediate SOAs. Unlike controls, where IOR manifested between 350 and 1000 ms, IOR was evident as early as 150 ms for HD patients. Further, the benefit of valid cueing correlated significantly with the level of impairment. Although patients exhibited poor fixation, principally attributable to saccadic intrusions, they were capable of appropriately suppressing a purely stimulus-driven response to the cue. A similar proportion of erroneous saccades to the cue were generated by both groups prior to stimulus onset, also correlating significantly with level of impairment. These results are discussed with respect to neural processes implicated in spatial cueing and within the context of reduced inhibitory activity of the BG in HD.","A non-predictive peripheral cueing paradigm was used to evaluate visuospatial attentional deficits in symptomatic HD patients, employing spatially valid and invalid visual cues over a range of stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) to elicit a saccadic response.","Although both patients and controls demonstrated initial facilitation for valid versus invalid cues following the shortest SOA, and a performance decrement (inhibition of return), at the longest SOA, a clear differentiation between these groups was found for the intermediate SOAs.

"This study aimed at identifying the effects of neonatal handling (H) and maternal separation (MS) on two paradigms of fear, learned and innate, and on the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactive cells in adult life. Wistar rats were daily handled with a brief maternal separation, maternal separated for 3 h or left undisturbed during the first 10 days of life. Behavioural responses in the open-field (innate fear) and conditioned fear (learned fear) were evaluated. Moreover, a semi-quantitative analysis of TH immunoreactivity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) was performed using optical densitometry and confirmed by planar measurements of neuronal density. Early handling decreased behaviour responses of innate and learned fear in adult life, while maternal separation had no significant long-lasting effect on these responses compared to the non-handled group. The behavioural effects of early handling could not be explained by changes in the density of midbrain dopaminergic cells, which were not affected by handling or maternal separation.","This study aimed at identifying the effects of neonatal handling (H) and maternal separation (MS) on two paradigms of fear, learned and innate, and on the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactive cells in adult life.","Wistar rats were daily handled with a brief maternal separation, maternal separated for 3 h or left undisturbed during the first 10 days of life.

"We tested the hypothesis that peripubertal anxiety levels are predictive of the detrimental effects of chronic stress on hippocampal-dependent spatial memory. The anxiety levels of peripubertal male Sprague-Dawley rats (43 days old) were characterized using open field and elevated plus mazes, followed by chronic restraint stress for 6 h/day/21 days beginning in young adulthood (75 days). Following chronic stress treatment, rats were tested on the spatial Y-maze using two inter-trial interval levels of difficulty (4 h: 1 day post-chronic stress; 1 min: 2 days post-chronic stress). As expected, all groups displayed intact spatial memory in the less difficult 1 min version of the Y-maze. However, in the 4 h version of the Y-maze, chronically stressed high anxiety rats showed impaired spatial memory, while chronically stressed low anxiety and control (low and high anxiety) rats displayed intact spatial memory. Moreover, a month after chronic stress ended, high anxiety rats had significantly higher basal corticosterone levels than low anxiety rats (control and stress). These results indicate that peripubertal anxiety and chronic stress interact to influence hippocampal-dependent spatial memory in adulthood.",We tested the hypothesis that peripubertal anxiety levels are predictive of the detrimental effects of chronic stress on hippocampal-dependent spatial memory.,"The anxiety levels of peripubertal male Sprague-Dawley rats (43 days old) were characterized using open field and elevated plus mazes, followed by chronic restraint stress for 6 h/day/21 days beginning in young adulthood (75 days).

"Crossed unilateral dopaminergic lesions of the nigrostriatal bundle and unilateral inferotemporal cortex ablations (DA x IT lesions) in marmoset monkeys produced impaired retention of object discriminations first learnt before, or after, the DA lesion but no impairment on new learning of the same type of task. Retention testing of a pre-operatively learned task was given after new learning of a different task so impairment cannot be attributed to improvement with practice or spontaneous recovery. We argue that the DA lesion produces a form of intentional neglect, a defect of volition, which is the mnemonic counterpart of the volitional neglect of directional hypokinesia, which animals with this lesion also exhibit. The DA lesion was unilateral (for welfare reasons) so the information to be retrieved had to be confined to that hemisphere by the use of an IT ablation in the other hemisphere. Unilateral DA lesion compromises the competence of ipsilateral fronto-striatal interactions and our results parallel those found in monkeys with crossed IT x frontal lesions that are impaired on complex tasks requiring effortful implementation of a cognitive strategy but are not impaired on discrimination learning. Parkinsonian patients with sub-total but bilateral DA loss may lack 'top-down' conative mechanisms as well as 'top-down' movement initiation mechanisms. They may fail to initiate retrieval strategies, although they may not exhibit retrograde amnesia under test conditions that provoke retrieval. Failure to self-initiate retrieval of relevant knowledge may contribute to the paucity of cognitive style and loss of executive skills exhibited by some patients with Parkinson's disease.","Crossed unilateral dopaminergic lesions of the nigrostriatal bundle and unilateral inferotemporal cortex ablations (DA x IT lesions) in marmoset monkeys produced impaired retention of object discriminations first learnt before, or after, the DA lesion but no impairment on new learning of the same type of task.

"In the present study, the effects of bilateral injections of cholinergic agents into the hippocampal CA1 region on morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) were investigated in male Wistar rats. Subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of different doses of morphine sulphate (0.5-6 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent CPP. Using a 3-day schedule of conditioning, it was found that intra-CA1 administration of the anticholinesterase, physostigmine (2, 4 and 8 microg/rat) significantly potentiated the morphine (0.5 mg/kg)-induced CPP. Moreover, intra-CA1 administration of the muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine (1, 4 and 7 microg/rat) inhibited the morphine (6 mg/kg)-induced CPP dose-dependently. On the other hand, atropine (7 microg/rat, intra-CA1) reversed the physostigmine-induced potentiation of the morphine response. Furthermore, intra-CA1 administration of nicotine (0.5, 0.75 and 1 microg/rat) with an ineffective dose of morphine (0.5 mg/kg) elicited a significant CPP. Bilateral injections of different doses of the nicotinic receptor antagonist, mecamylamine (2, 4 and 8 microg/rat) into the CA1 regions significantly inhibited the morphine (6 mg/kg)-induced CPP. Moreover mecamylamine (8 microg/rat, intra-CA1) decreased the effect of nicotine-induced potentiation of the morphine response. Intra-CA1 injections of physostigmine, atropine, nicotine or mecamylamine alone did not induce a significant place preference or place aversion. It may be concluded that the muscarinic and nicotinic receptors of the hippocampal CA1 regions play an important role in morphine reward.","In the present study, the effects of bilateral injections of cholinergic agents into the hippocampal CA1 region on morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) were investigated in male Wistar rats.","Subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of different doses of morphine sulphate (0.5-6 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent CPP.

"The sensorial stimulation arising from a physically stressed (PS) subject may produce emotional stress in a witnessing partner (WP). Both members of the pair develop functional changes. We tested changes in locomotor activity (crossing) and in the defensive burying test in WP, and PS adult male Wistar rats having been submitted to a single 10 min session in a two-compartment cage. During this session, the WP rats received auditory and olfactory stimulation coming from a PS pair submitted to unavoidable electric footshocks (1 mA, dc, 0.5s, 0.5c/s, 10 min). This experiment was replicated in other groups pre-treated with vehicle or diazepam, and their urine was collected and analyzed by the static Head-Space and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HS-GC/MS) techniques. The WP group displayed a significantly higher crossing [F((2,45))=4.31, P&lt;0.01] and more cumulative burying time [F((2,22))=4.73, P&lt;0.01] than the control or PS groups. Diazepam (1mg/kg) reverted these changes. Our results indicate that the conspecific sensorial communication coming from the PS group produces anxiety probably mediated by 2-heptanone, since the HS-GC/MS analyses showed the highest amount of 2-heptanone in the urine from the PS group [F((2,42))=5.17, P&lt;0.009].",The sensorial stimulation arising from a physically stressed (PS) subject may produce emotional stress in a witnessing partner (WP).

"The present study investigated whether proliferation of hippocampal progenitors is subject to circadian modulation. Mice were perfused using 3h intervals throughout the light-dark cycle and brains were stained for Ki-67. Since Ki-67 is not expressed during the G0 phase of the cell cycle, we expected a decline in Ki-67 expression at the moment cells synchronously exit the cell cycle. However, despite the fact that various hippocampal factors fluctuate across the day, the number of dividing cells remained constant. In a second experiment, we studied whether disturbance of normal sleep affected the stable rate in cell proliferation. Our data show that 12h of sleep deprivation during the light phase did not influence proliferating cell number. A third experiment investigated whether physical activity, a condition known to enhance hippocampal cell proliferation, caused an elevation of the steady baseline number of proliferating progenitors, or a peak directly following the active phase of the animals. Mice were housed with a running wheel for 9 days. On the last day, animals were sacrificed either directly before or directly after the active phase. Exercise significantly promoted cell proliferation and this effect appeared to be strongest directly after the active period and to disappear during the resting phase. Our data suggest that hippocampal cell proliferation is not synchronized under basal conditions and is unchanged by sleep deprivation. However, running affected cell proliferation differentially at two times of day. These data demonstrate that the steady rate in cell proliferation is not indispensable, but can be changed by behavioral activity.","The present study investigated whether proliferation of hippocampal progenitors is subject to circadian modulation.

"Performance of Long-Evans rats repeatedly treated with a high dose of phencyclidine (PCP) was compared with that of controls on two tasks involving rule shifts. Fifteen hours after receiving 12 daily doses of PCP (10mg/kg) or saline, rats were tested in the first task where a fixed or variable goal had to be recognized among four maze-arm locations. After receiving the last of 33 injections, rats were subjected to a second task: they had to discriminate the relevant perceptual dimension in a pair of stimuli and choose the appropriate stimulus in each problem. Results from both tasks revealed no difference between controls and rats injected with PCP either during acquisition using a constant rule or during testing with rule shifts. Consequently, PCP appears to lack consistency in disturbing frontal cognitive functions in animal models of schizophrenia.",Performance of Long-Evans rats repeatedly treated with a high dose of phencyclidine (PCP) was compared with that of controls on two tasks involving rule shifts.,"Fifteen hours after receiving 12 daily doses of PCP (10mg/kg) or saline, rats were tested in the first task where a fixed or variable goal had to be recognized among four maze-arm locations.

"In the present study we investigated the action of alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid on the effects elicited by chronic hyperprolinemia on rat performance in the Morris water maze. Rats received subcutaneous injections of proline (experimental group) twice a day, with 10 h-interval, from the 6 to 28th days of age or an equivalent volume of 0.9% saline solution (controls). Half of the proline-treated group also received intraperitoneal administration of alpha-tocopherol (40 mg/kg) and of ascorbic acid (100 mg/kg) from the 6 to 28th days of life. On the 60th day of life, rats were subjected to testing in the water maze. Results show that chronic proline administration provokes impairment on spatial learning in reference memory task, as revealed by the increase of latency in acquisition, in the probe trial and in crossing over the platform location, as well as by the number of crossings, when compared to saline-treated animals. Proline-treated rats also demonstrated a reduced efficiency to find the platform position in the working memory task. Rats chronically treated with proline plus alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid had above effects prevented, suggesting the participation of oxidative stress in such effects. Our findings lend support to a novel therapeutic strategy, based on these vitamins, to the cognitive dysfunction associated with hyperprolinemia type II.",In the present study we investigated the action of alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid on the effects elicited by chronic hyperprolinemia on rat performance in the Morris water maze.,"Rats received subcutaneous injections of proline (experimental group) twice a day, with 10 h-interval, from the 6 to 28th days of age or an equivalent volume of 0.9% saline solution (controls).

"Sensitization of dopaminergic neural reward circuits has been hypothesized to be involved in the development of drug addiction. Highly palatable foods activate these same brain areas, specifically the nucleus accumbens. In this study, the effects of a highly palatable food (sucrose) on these circuits were investigated using the dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptor agonist quinpirole. Male Long-Evans rats received 30 min daily access to 0.3 M sucrose solution or water over nine consecutive days, followed by nine daily injections of quinpirole (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) or saline. Locomotor activity was assessed using an automated open-field system. Locomotor sensitization developed, as quinpirole-treated rats traveled significantly more, and exhibited a greater number of movements than saline controls. A characteristic pattern of an initial suppression of locomotor activity, followed by excitation of activity was observed in quinpirole-treated rats. Pre-exposure to sucrose attenuated the initial suppression of activity, and facilitated excitation of activity. Rats that were pre-exposed to sucrose exhibited a reduced suppression of activity as compared to rats pre-exposed to water. Rats receiving sucrose and quinpirole also displayed a significantly greater enhancement of locomotor activity as compared to rats receiving water and quinpirole. These results support the hypothesis that highly palatable foods can alter the same neural reward circuits as drugs of abuse, and may facilitate sensitization-related addiction. This may aid in further understanding the neural basis of eating disorders.","Sensitization of dopaminergic neural reward circuits has been hypothesized to be involved in the development of drug addiction.

"Trimethylthiazoline (TMT) is a component of fox feces and is thought to be a stimulus with innate fear-eliciting properties for rodents. Naive laboratory rats that are exposed to TMT display freezing behavior, a known behavioral sign of fear and anxiety. Early studies examining the neural basis of TMT-induced fear showed that the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis is important for this behavior. In contrast, the central and lateral nuclei of the amygdala does not seem to participate in the neural processing of TMT-induced fear. However, a study investigating c-fos expression in response to TMT-exposure revealed a strong activation of the medial as well as a weak activation of the basolateral amygdala. Therefore, the present study examined the effects of temporary inactivation of the medial and basolateral amygdala on TMT-induced freezing. Temporary inactivation was accomplished by local injections of the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol into the areas of interest. TMT-induced freezing was completely blocked by temporary inactivation of the medial amygdala. Temporary inactivation of the basolateral amygdala resulted in a delay of the onset of the freezing response to TMT. These results clearly demonstrate that the medial amygdala is crucial for TMT-induced freezing, whereas the basolateral amygdala seems to play a modulatory role in this type of fear behavior. Since the medial amygdala is also involved in the processing of cat odor-induced fear, the finding of the present study points towards a general role of the medial amygdala in the processing of predator odor-induced fear.","Trimethylthiazoline (TMT) is a component of fox feces and is thought to be a stimulus with innate fear-eliciting properties for rodents.

"The serum and glucocorticoid inducible kinase isoform SGK3 is expressed in the brain including hippocampal neurons. It is activated by phosphoinositide-3 (PI3) kinase and thus a putative target of neurotrophic factors. In vitro experiments pointed to the ability of SGK3 to regulate several transporters and ion channels including the AMPA receptor GluR1. In order to explore the in vivo functional significance of SGK3 in the regulation of spatial learning and exploratory behavior, we assessed the performance of SGK3 knockout mice (SGK3-/-) and their wild type littermates (SGK3+/+) in a place navigation task in the water-maze, radial maze in a battery of forced and free exploration tests, acoustic startle and a test for motoric coordination. According to water-maze and radial maze testing reference and working memory was intact in SGK3-/- mice. However, detailed analysis of swimming patterns of SGK3-/- mice in the water-maze revealed a deficit in precision and goal-directed navigation in space. SGK3-/- mice showed reduced exploratory activity, which was observed in several environments and increased centre field avoidance in the open-field. SGK3-/- mice further showed reduced darting behavior on open surfaces, indicating that the knock out may modify basic patterns of locomotion. In conclusion, lack of SGK3 leads to subtle behavioral defects which may result from deranged neuronal regulation of transporters and ion channels.",The serum and glucocorticoid inducible kinase isoform SGK3 is expressed in the brain including hippocampal neurons.

"Male zebra finches reared in family groups were housed initially in small indoors cages with three other companions. At 4-5 months of age these birds were treated with [(3)H]-thymidine and then placed in large outdoors aviaries by themselves or with other zebra finches. Counts of new neurons were made 40, 60 and 150 days after the change in housing. Recruitment of new neurons in nidopallium caudale (NC) was higher than in the hippocampal complex (HC); but in both brain regions it was higher in communally housed birds than in birds housed singly, suggesting that the complexity of the social setting affects new neuron survival. In addition, the new neurons lived longer in rostral NC than in its caudal counterpart, and neuronal turnover was faster and more significant in NC than in HC. Albeit indirect, this may be the first suggestion that different parts of the brain upgrade memories at different time intervals, yielding an anatomical representation of time.",Male zebra finches reared in family groups were housed initially in small indoors cages with three other companions.,"At 4-5 months of age these birds were treated with [(3)H]-thymidine and then placed in large outdoors aviaries by themselves or with other zebra finches.

"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the CNS plays an important regulatory role in anxiety-related responses as exogenous administration of NPY exerts an anxiolytic-like effect in rodents. This effect is believed to be mediated by the Y(1) receptor system as pharmacological modulation of this Y(1) receptor system results in an increase in anxiety. Here we present a comprehensive phenotyping strategy for characterizing Y(1) receptor knockout animals at different times of the circadian rhythm using several motor activity-, exploration-, and anxiety-related behavioural tasks including open field, elevated plus maze, light-dark, and hole board test. We show that Y(1) deficiency has an important effect on motor activity and explorative-like behaviours and that it results in marked alterations in anxiety-related behaviours. Importantly, the behavioural phenotype of the Y(1) receptor knockout mice is circadian rhythm-dependent and also influenced by stimuli such as restraint stress. In addition, we found evidence for increases in working memory. Taken together, these findings suggest an important role of Y(1) receptors in the regulation of motor activity, exploration, and anxiety-related behaviours.

"Agonistic interactions are present throughout the animal kingdom as well as in humans. In this report, we present a model system to study neurological correlates of dominant-subordinate relationships. Zebrafish, Danio rerio, has been used as a model system for developmental biology for decades. We propose here that it is also an excellent model for studying social behavior. Adult male zebrafish were separated for 5 days and then pairs were formed and allowed to interact for 5 days. Under these conditions, aggression is prevalent and dominant-subordinate relationships are quickly established. Dominant behavior is characterized by a repeated pattern of chasing and biting, whereas subordinates engage in retreats. By day 5, the dominant-subordinate relationship was firmly established and there were differences in behavior over time. Chases, bites and retreats were all less frequent on day 5 of the social interaction than on day 1. Arginine vasotocin is the teleostean homologue of arginine vasopressin, a neuropeptide whose expression has been linked to aggression and social position in mammals. Immunohistochemistry indicated differences in vasotocin staining between dominant and subordinate individuals. Dominant individuals express vasotocin in one to three pairs of large cells in the magnocellular preoptic area whereas subordinate individuals express vasotocin in 7-11 pairs of small cells in the parvocellular preoptic area. These results suggest that the vasotocinergic system may play a role in shaping dominant-subordinate relationships and agonistic behavior in this model organism.","Agonistic interactions are present throughout the animal kingdom as well as in humans.

"Hibernation is a unique and highly regulated physiological state characterized by profound, albeit periodically reversible, depression in body temperature, metabolism, and consciousness. Hippocampal synapses undergo pronounced remodeling in concert with torpor and arousal. During hibernation, the number of postsynaptic densities, apical dendritic branches, and spine densities decreases substantially in the hippocampus. Upon arousal these parameters increase beyond pre-hibernation levels and peak within 2-3h. By 24h after arousal, dendritic parameters remain elevated but have started to subside, consistent with pruning and differentiation. The present study examined the functional consequences of these natural changes in synaptic structure. Wild-caught Arctic ground squirrels (AGS) were trained in a hippocampal-dependent contextual fear conditioning task at 3h, 24h, or 4 weeks after arousal (warm-adapted euthermic control group). All groups acquired the fear conditioned response similarly on the training day. During a subsequent retention test session, AGS in the 24h group exhibited enhanced expression of contextual fear compared to the other two groups. These data suggest that the morphological and biochemical changes occurring at 24h after arousal from hibernation affect hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. The natural change in synaptic structure during hibernation may provide a unique opportunity to assess the neural substrates underlying cognitive enhancement.","Hibernation is a unique and highly regulated physiological state characterized by profound, albeit periodically reversible, depression in body temperature, metabolism, and consciousness.

"Schizophrenic patients have deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI) that may be alleviated by smoking/nicotine. The effect of nicotinic agents on PPI in rodents is equivocal and few studies in mice have been reported. Thus, we assessed nicotine's (0.03-1mg/kg) effect on PPI in five mouse strains with no effects. We next determined if nicotine would reverse a phencyclidine (PCP)-induced deficit of PPI in BALB/cByJ and NMRI mice. BALB/cByJ mice have a low density of [(125)I]alpha-bungaratoxin binding in the hippocampus and poor inhibitory gating of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs), a model related to PPI. At 1mg/kg, nicotine selectively reversed the PCP-induced deficit of PPI in BALB/cByJ mice. The pharmacokinetic profile of nicotine (T(1/2), C(max), T(max) and AUC) was identical in both strains, obviating this as a factor for the strain-dependent effect observed. Moreover, 1mg/kg nicotine inhibited in vivo [(3)H]epibatidine binding with the same time-course in both strains, indicating no difference in brain ""kinetics"". Since high doses of nicotine were effective in BALB/cByJ mice a role for low-affinity nicotinic receptors, e.g. alpha(7) receptors, is plausible. Clozapine, but not risperidone, also only reversed the PCP deficit of PPI in BALB/cByJ. Clozapine and nicotine also enhance inhibitory gating of AEPs in DBA/2 mice, and clozapine's effect is antagonized by an alpha(7) antagonist.

"We have found that protein malnutrition (PM) causes a significant impairment of memory-related behavior on the 15th and 20th day after the start of PM (5% casein) feeding in prepubertal mice but not in postpubertal mice, as measured by a passive-avoidance task. This impairment was almost completely reversed by merely switching to a standard protein (20% casein) diet on the 10th day after the start of PM. However, the reversal was not observed when the switching to a standard protein regimen was done on the 15th day of the PM diet. Interestingly, the impairment of memory-related behavior on the 20th day was improved by the chronic administration of physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg/day x last 10 days, i.p.), a cholinesterase inhibitor. To correlate brain cholinergic neuron function with the memory-related behavior impairment induced by PM, microphotometry was used to determine the histological distribution of the imunofluorescence intensity for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), a functional marker of presynapse in cholinergic neurons. The change in the intensity of fluorescence indicated that ChAT protein was decreased in the hippocampus (CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus) on the 20th day after PM feeding in comparison with controls. These results suggest the possibility that the memory-related behavior deficits observed in prepubertal mice with PM are caused by a dysfunction of the cholinergic neurons in the hippocampus.","We have found that protein malnutrition (PM) causes a significant impairment of memory-related behavior on the 15th and 20th day after the start of PM (5% casein) feeding in prepubertal mice but not in postpubertal mice, as measured by a passive-avoidance task.

"Ric-8 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for a subset of Galpha proteins and it is required to maintain Galpha(q) and the Galpha(s) pathways in functional state. In adult mice Ric-8 is expressed in regions involved in the regulation of behavior (neocortex, cingulate cortex and hippocampus). As Ric-8 is shown to regulate neuronal transmitter release, the aim of present study was to perform behavioral analysis of ric-8 mutant. Homozygous (-/-) ric-8 mutant mice are not viable and die in early embryonic development, therefore for behavioral analysis heterozygous (+/-) ric-8 mutant mice were used. We found decreased anxiety of ric-8 heterozygous mice in light-dark compartment test where mutant mice significantly avoided the light compartment. In spatial learning paradigm (Morris water maze) the performance of ric-8 (+/-) mice was impaired. Namely, in the reversal test, ric-8 (+/-) mice exhibited significant delay to find the hidden platform compared to wild-type (wt) littermates. We did not find differences in the behavioral tests reflecting the motor abilities of mice (motor activity, rota-rod). Therefore, described alterations seem to be specific for anxiety and spatial learning. Based on these results we can conclude the importance of ric-8 in the regulation of memory and emotional behavior.","Ric-8 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for a subset of Galpha proteins and it is required to maintain Galpha(q) and the Galpha(s) pathways in functional state.

"Self-grooming in rodents is stereotypically sequenced and naturally occurs after arousal, novelty, or stress. Grooming expression and syntax resulting from stressful and appetitive conditions were assessed in male Long Evans rats treated daily with 10mg/kg of phencyclidine (PCP) for 15 days. Approximately 20 h after the 1st, the 8th, and/or the 15th injection, grooming was induced with water sprays, a loud sound, or smearing food. Behaviors expressed during the seconds or minutes that followed induction were videotaped and codified. Results showed that subchronic treatment with PCP amplified the grooming response in all stressful and appetitive conditions, but provoked a disorganization of grooming sequences only under the stressful, water condition. Thus, PCP enhanced grooming expression indiscriminately. However, this behavior had to serve both hygienic and stress managing purposes in order for chain sequencing to become disorganized as a consequence of drug treatment. These results suggest that the detailed examination of grooming expression and organization is an appropriate tool to measure stress-induced behavioral sensitization and motor functions in animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.","Self-grooming in rodents is stereotypically sequenced and naturally occurs after arousal, novelty, or stress.","Grooming expression and syntax resulting from stressful and appetitive conditions were assessed in male Long Evans rats treated daily with 10mg/kg of phencyclidine (PCP) for 15 days.

"Despite the widespread use of inbred mice in research, little is known about aging of the circadian system in female mice, although interactions between female gonadal hormones and circadian rhythms have been established. We investigated the influence of the estrus cycle on circadian aspects of running-wheel activity and changes in the course of aging in female C57BL/6 and C3H/He mice recorded continuously between the ages of 3 and 19 months. In the young, cycling mice the second part of the proestrus night was often, but not consistently, characterized by increased motor activity compared to the remaining estrus cycle nights. After estrus cycling had ceased in the course of ageing, the estrus-dependent day-to-day variability in activity was reduced. The amplitude of the daily rest-activity rhythm decreased progressively after the age of 8 months in C3H/He and 10 months in C57BL/6 mice. The capacity for resynchronisation of activity onset to the LD-cycle was compared in young and old mice after an 8-h phase advance of the LD-cycle. Resynchronisation was significantly slower in old C3H/He mice and unaffected by age in C57BL/6 mice. The circadian period in constant darkness did not change with age in either strain. However, the period was shorter in 17-month old C57BL/6 mice compared to an additional group, which was recorded at the same age, after at least 1-month adaptation to the recording conditions. The results show that the reproductive state as well as ageing influence motor activity patterns of female mice in a strain- and cohort-dependent manner.","Despite the widespread use of inbred mice in research, little is known about aging of the circadian system in female mice, although interactions between female gonadal hormones and circadian rhythms have been established.","We investigated the influence of the estrus cycle on circadian aspects of running-wheel activity and changes in the course of aging in female C57BL/6 and C3H/He mice recorded continuously between the ages of 3 and 19 months.

"The present study assesses the involvement of the supramammillary and adjacent nuclei in spatial memory and anxiety-like behaviors. Rats with electrolytic lesions in the supramammillary nucleus were pre- and post-operatively trained in two spatial memory tasks and two anxiety tasks. Spatial memory tasks were performed in an open field with seven different goal positions containing the reward. Anxiety-like behaviors were tested in the elevated T-maze. In the spatial reference memory task, neither lesioned nor sham-lesioned groups were impaired. In the working memory task, lesioned animals were permanently impaired in their ability to solve the delayed-matching-to-position task. This working memory deficit is not related to increased proactive interference. It could be related to impairment of the rats ability to reorganize spatial stimuli. Consequently, rats were not able to achieve an optimal performance level to solve spatial tasks with continuous changes in the place location. In the elevated T-maze, lesioned rats reduced passive avoidance response but no changes in the escape response were observed. These results suggest a clear involvement of the supramammillary nucleus in working memory and behavioral inhibition but not in either spatial reference memory or in escape responses.",The present study assesses the involvement of the supramammillary and adjacent nuclei in spatial memory and anxiety-like behaviors.,Rats with electrolytic lesions in the supramammillary nucleus were pre- and post-operatively trained in two spatial memory tasks and two anxiety tasks.

"Considering that adolescence is associated with an increased motivation to seek out new stimuli and with low anxiety levels in exploring novel environments, and that both behavioral traits may be associated with substance abuse, we investigated whether the behavioral response to a novel environment can predict subsequent oral nicotine self-administration in adolescent C57BL/6 mice. On postnatal day 30 (PN30), the novelty-seeking behavior and anxiety levels were assessed in a hole board activity box. The total number of head-dips (DIP) was used to classify animals either into the high novelty (HN; DIP above median) or low novelty (LN; DIP below median) groups. The percentage of center squares crossed (CEN) was used to classify animals either into the high anxiety (HA; CEN below median) or low anxiety (LA; CEN above median) groups. From PN31 to PN41, all animals were given a free choice between tap water or a nicotine solution (10 microg/ml). LN mice did not change nicotine intake throughout the free choice procedure, however, HN mice presented a marked increase in consumption. There were no differences in consumption between HA and LA mice. Our results indicated that mice that presented a more intense novelty-seeking behavior increased their preference for nicotine during the free choice experiment but that anxiety levels did not predict nicotine consumption. These results suggest that higher motivation to seek out new experiences is a significant contributor to drug use in adolescents and that anxiety is probably not a major factor that determines differential nicotine consumption during adolescence.","Considering that adolescence is associated with an increased motivation to seek out new stimuli and with low anxiety levels in exploring novel environments, and that both behavioral traits may be associated with substance abuse, we investigated whether the behavioral response to a novel environment can predict subsequent oral nicotine self-administration in adolescent C57BL/6 mice.","On postnatal day 30 (PN30), the novelty-seeking behavior and anxiety levels were assessed in a hole board activity box.

"Rabbits were trace-conditioned with a tone as a conditioned stimulus and an airpuff as an unconditioned stimulus. Electrical stimulation to the medial forebrain bundle in the lateral hypothalamus was delivered either before or after the tone-airpuff pair. The purpose of the present study was to test whether the effect of post-trial hypothalamic stimulation differed from the effect of pre-trial hypothalamic stimulation on trace conditioning in the same subjects. Additionally, hippocampal responses were measured during sessions to see if hypothalamic stimulation activated dopaminergic fibres and affected hippocampal cell functioning and thus learning. The results showed that behavioral nictitating membrane conditioned responses were acquired quickly and hippocampal multiple unit activity increased with post-trial hypothalamic stimulation in comparison to almost non-existent conditioned responses and activity changes in the pre-trial hypothalamic stimulation sessions. The results suggest that hypothalamic stimulation affects trace conditioning differently depending on its time of delivery during conditioning.",Rabbits were trace-conditioned with a tone as a conditioned stimulus and an airpuff as an unconditioned stimulus.

"Studies examining the effects of hippocampal lesions on object recognition memory in rats have produced conflicting results. The present study investigated how methodological differences and lesion size may have contributed to these discrepancies. In Experiment 1 we compared rats with complete, partial (septal) and sham hippocampal lesions on a spontaneous object recognition task, using a protocol previously reported to result in deficits following large hippocampal lesions . Rats with complete and partial hippocampal lesions were unimpaired, suggesting the hippocampus is not required for object recognition memory. However, rats with partial lesions showed relatively poor performance raising the possibility that floor effects masked a deficit on this group. In Experiment 2, we used a second spontaneous object recognition protocol similar to that used by the two other studies that have reported deficits following hippocampal lesions . Rats with complete hippocampal lesions were significantly impaired, whereas rats with partial lesions were unimpaired. However, the complete lesion group showed less object exploration during the sample phase. Thus, the apparent recognition memory deficit in Experiment 2 may be attributable to differential encoding. Together, these findings suggest that the hippocampus is not required for intact spontaneous object recognition memory. These findings suggest that levels of object exploration during the sample phase may be a critical issue, and raise the possibility that previous reports of object recognition deficits may be due to differences in object exploration rather than deficits in object recognition per se.",Studies examining the effects of hippocampal lesions on object recognition memory in rats have produced conflicting results.

"Repeated exposure to swimming stress induces a long-lasting hyperalgesia in the rat by mechanisms to be elucidated. Since opioid and glutamate neurotransmitter systems modulate pain, we now evaluated the effect of pharmacological blockade of opioid and glutamate receptors subtypes on forced swimming stress-induced hyperalgesia. Male rats were daily subjected to 10-20 min of forced or sham swimming for 3 days and thermal nociception was estimated twice, before each behavioral conditioning and 24 h after the last, using hot plate test. Selective opioid and NMDA receptor antagonists were administered i.p. either before each conditioning session or before the second nociception assessment. Unlike sham swimming rats, forced swimming rats showed significant reductions in hot plate response latencies (hyperalgesia) after the last swimming session, as compared to pre-stress values. Rats treated with the opioid receptor antagonists naloxone (0.1 mg/kg, non-subtype-selective) and naloxonazine (5 mg/kg, mu(1)-subtype-selective), before each forced swimming, did not become hyperalgesic, whereas those treated before the second post-stress assessment of nociception developed hyperalgesia. Naltrindole (0.5 mg/kg, delta-subtype-selective) and nor-binaltorphimine (0.5mg/kg, kappa-subtype-selective) were inactive in both administration schedules. The efficacy of morphine (3-7.5 mg/kg) to produce analgesia in forced swimming rats was lower than in sham swimming rats. Rats treated with the NMDA antagonist ketamine (5 mg/kg) before the forced swimming or the second post-stress assessment of nociception did not have hyperalgesia. Thus, swim stress-induced hyperalgesia might be initiated by the repeated stimulation of mu-opioid and NMDA receptors but maintained only by the activity of NMDA receptors.","Repeated exposure to swimming stress induces a long-lasting hyperalgesia in the rat by mechanisms to be elucidated.

"The environment in which alcohol consumption occurs may trigger later relapse in alcohol abusers. In this study, we tested whether an alcohol-associated environment would induce alcohol-seeking behavior. Male rats were trained to lever press for oral alcohol reinforcement in a distinctive context. Responding was then extinguished in a context with different olfactory, visual and tactile properties. Placement of the rats back into the original context in which they self-administered alcohol induced, in the absence of alcohol availability, a significant increase in lever press responding on the alcohol lever as compared to extinction levels of responding. The ability of the alcohol context to support alcohol-seeking behavior was maintained over 3 weeks, with no significant diminution. A second group of rats was trained to lever press for sucrose reinforcement; this group also demonstrated context-dependent reinstatement, although the degree of reinstatement decreased over repeated tests, returning to extinction values after 3 weeks. These findings indicate that contextual conditioning has a long-term impact on ethanol-seeking behavior after ethanol withdrawal. This animal model may be useful to study the neural mechanisms underlying relapse induced by ethanol-associated contexts in humans.","The environment in which alcohol consumption occurs may trigger later relapse in alcohol abusers.

"3-Acetoxy-6beta-acetylthio-10-oxo-N-cyclopropylmethyl-dihydronormorphine (KT-95) is a synthesized compound that binds to mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptors in vitro. KT-95 induces analgesia and this effect is antagonized by nor-BNI, a selective kappa-opioid receptor antagonist. We have reported that kappa-opioid receptor agonists improve impairment of learning and memory in mice and/or rats. In this study, the effects of KT-95 were investigated in an acetic acid-induced writhing test and scopolamine-induced memory impairment test using spontaneous alternation performance in a Y-maze and a step-down type passive avoidance test. Male ddY mice were treated with KT-95 (0.24-2.35 micromol/kg, s.c.) 30 min before the behavioral test. In the writhing test, the antinociceptive effect of KT-95 (2.35 micromol/kg) was completely antagonized by nor-BNI (4.9 nmol/mouse, i.c.v.), but not by naloxone (3.05 micromol/kg, s.c.). KT-95 significantly improved the impairment of spontaneous alternation induced by scopolamine (1.65 micromol/kg, s.c.). The ameliorating effect of KT-95 was not antagonized by nor-BNI, but was almost completely antagonized by a selective sigma-receptor antagonist, N,N-dipropyl-2-[4-methoxy-3-(2-phenylenoxy)-phenyl]-ethylamine monohydrochloride (NE-100, 2.6 micromol/kg, i.p.). KT-95 also significantly improved scopolamine-induced learning and memory impairment in the passive avoidance test, although the effect was partial. Administration of KT-95 itself induced impairment of learning and memory. KT-95-induced impairment was not antagonized by naloxone, naltrindole, nor-BNI or NE-100 indicating that this impairment was not because of opioid receptor stimulation. These results suggested that although the KT-95-induced antinociceptive effect was mediated by kappa-opioid receptors, the KT-95-induced improvement in scopolamine-induced impairment of memory was mediated mainly via sigma-receptors and partially by kappa-opioid receptors.","3-Acetoxy-6beta-acetylthio-10-oxo-N-cyclopropylmethyl-dihydronormorphine (KT-95) is a synthesized compound that binds to mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptors in vitro.

Male ddY mice were treated with KT-95 (0.24-2.35 micromol/kg, s.c.) 30 min before the behavioral test. In the writhing test, the antinociceptive effect of KT-95 (2.35 micromol/kg) was completely antagonized by nor-BNI (4.9 nmol/mouse, i.c.v.), but not by naloxone (3.05 micromol/kg, s.c.).","KT-95 significantly improved the impairment of spontaneous alternation induced by scopolamine (1.65 micromol/kg, s.c.). The ameliorating effect of KT-95 was not antagonized by nor-BNI, but was almost completely antagonized by a selective sigma-receptor antagonist, N,N-dipropyl-2-[4-methoxy-3-(2-phenylenoxy)-phenyl]-ethylamine monohydrochloride (NE-100, 2.6 micromol/kg, i.p.). KT-95 also significantly improved scopolamine-induced learning and memory impairment in the passive avoidance test, although the effect was partial. Administration of KT-95 itself induced impairment of learning and memory. KT-95-induced impairment was not antagonized by naloxone, naltrindole, nor-BNI or NE-100 indicating that this impairment was not because of opioid receptor stimulation. These results suggested that although the KT-95-induced antinociceptive effect was mediated by kappa-opioid receptors, the KT-95-induced improvement in scopolamine-induced impairment of memory was mediated mainly via sigma-receptors and partially by kappa-opioid receptors.",1,1,1,"KT-95 significantly improved the impairment of spontaneous alternation induced by scopolamine (1.65 micromol/kg, s.c.).

"The present study determined whether rearing in social isolation alters the behavioural response produced by the selective noradrenaline uptake inhibitor, desipramine when rats are exposed to the forced swimming test or an open field arena. Male Wistar rats were raised from weaning either alone (isolation rearing) or in groups of five or six rats/cage (social rearing) for 4 weeks before behavioural testing. The results demonstrated that sub-chronic administration of desipramine (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg i.p.) 24, 5 and 1 h caused a dose-related decrease in immobility time and increase struggling and produced locomotor hypoactivity compared with saline treated rats in both isolation and socially reared rats. However, these effects were significantly greater in isolation than socially reared rats. The results indicate isolation rearing alters the response to aversive stimuli and that sub-chronic antidepressant treatment potentiates these effects.","The present study determined whether rearing in social isolation alters the behavioural response produced by the selective noradrenaline uptake inhibitor, desipramine when rats are exposed to the forced swimming test or an open field arena.",Male Wistar rats were raised from weaning either alone (isolation rearing) or in groups of five or six rats/cage (social rearing) for 4 weeks before behavioural testing.,"The results demonstrated that sub-chronic administration of desipramine (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg i.p.) 24, 5 and 1 h caused a dose-related decrease in immobility time and increase struggling and produced locomotor hypoactivity compared with saline treated rats in both isolation and socially reared rats.

"Feline defensive rage is a form of aggression occurring in nature in response to a threatening condition and is elicited under laboratory conditions by electrical stimulation of the medial hypothalamus or midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG). Since it has recently been shown that cytokines can modulate neurotransmitter release, the present study was designed to determine the effects of administration of interleukin 2 (IL-2) into the PAG upon defensive rage elicited from the medial hypothalamus. Microinjections of relatively low doses of IL-2 into the dorsal PAG significantly facilitated defensive rage behavior elicited from the medial hypothalamus. The specificity of this phenomenon was supported by the following findings: (1) IL-2 induced effects were dose- and time-dependent, (2) the facilitative effects of IL-2 could be completely blocked by pre-treatment of the injection site with either anti-IL-2 or anti-IL-2 receptor antibody and (3) IL-2 administration into the PAG showed no effect upon another form of aggression, namely predatory attack, elicited from the lateral hypothalamus. The findings further demonstrated that the effects of IL-2 were mediated by an NK(1) receptor mechanism since pre-treatment of the PAG with an NK(1) receptor antagonist completely blocked the facilitating effects of IL-2. Immunocytochemical observations supported these findings by demonstrating an extensive pattern of labeling of IL-2Ralpha in the dorsal PAG. The present study thus demonstrates that IL-2 in the dorsal PAG potentiates defensive rage behavior and is mediated through an NK(1) receptor mechanism.","Feline defensive rage is a form of aggression occurring in nature in response to a threatening condition and is elicited under laboratory conditions by electrical stimulation of the medial hypothalamus or midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG).

"The aim of the present study was to characterize the regional electroencephalographic substratum of the awakening process by means of a Hz-by-Hz EEG spectral power analysis. For this purpose, we recorded a group of 25 female subjects who slept for at least two consecutive nights in the laboratory. The post-sleep waking EEG was compared to the one recorded during the presleep wakefulness from four midline derivations (Fz-A1, Cz-A1, Pz-A1, Oz-A1). Results indicated that the first 10 min after awakening are characterized by an increase of EEG power in the low-frequency range (1-9 Hz) compared to the corresponding presleep waking period, and by a significant decrease of EEG power in the beta range (18-24 Hz). As regards topographic differences, the increase of EEG power upon awakening in the delta-theta range showed a parieto-occipital prevalence. Moreover, the occipital derivation showed a larger decrease of power in the beta range as compared to the other derivations. In conclusion, the EEG substratum of the sleep offset period is characterized by a pattern of increased EEG power in the delta-theta and low-alpha bands, and of decreased power in the beta range. This pattern could be considered as the spectral EEG signature of the sleep inertia phenomenon. The state of post-sleep EEG hypo-arousal does not subside in the first 10-min period after awakening considered in the present analysis. Finally, according to our results, the more posterior scalp locations show stronger EEG signs of sleep inertia, and could be the last ones to properly wake up.",The aim of the present study was to characterize the regional electroencephalographic substratum of the awakening process by means of a Hz-by-Hz EEG spectral power analysis.,"For this purpose, we recorded a group of 25 female subjects who slept for at least two consecutive nights in the laboratory.

"Animal models have been used in understanding the neuro-biological basis of depression and predicting successful treatment strategies. The current study focused on two genetic models of depression, the Flinder's Sensitive Line (FSL) and Wister-Kyoto (WKY). Our laboratory showed depressive symptomatology in pre-pubertal WKY and FSL rats, and the current study focused on the strains' anxiety-like traits. Since human depression-anxiety comorbidity is very common at young ages, it is essential to establish whether FSL and WKY pre-pubertal rats also exhibit such comorbidity. In addition, the effect of different rearing environments was studied using a mild chronic-stress condition (limiting available bedding between post-natal days 2-9). Two well-validated tests of anxiety, the open-field and elevated plus-maze, were used on 40-day-old pups. FSL pups exhibited lower anxiety-like behavior when compared to controls, in traditional open-field and plus-maze measures. A different pattern was observed in the WKY strain, which exhibited heightened anxiety-like behaviours in the FSL strain and affecting WKY's body-weight. Overall, the findings indicate differential expression of anxiety in pre-pubertal rats belonging to the 'depressed' strains, suggesting that these strains may be suitable for modelling different sub-groups of depression at young ages.","Animal models have been used in understanding the neuro-biological basis of depression and predicting successful treatment strategies.

"We used a putative animal model of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the SHR rat, to examine the effects of repeated exposure to methylphenidate (MPH; Ritalin) during the pubertal period on cocaine-induced conditioned place preference and dopamine (DA) levels in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in adulthood.

"The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is a commonly used animal model of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Previous literature is inconclusive with respect to the exact nature of memory impairments in this strain. The objective of this study was to assess spatial memory as measured by performance of male SHR, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats on a win-shift version of the water radial arm maze. On this task, all strains made more errors on Trial 4 when the mnemonic demand was highest, and showed a similar response when the delay was increased from 60s to 2h on Week 3. Both SHR and WKY rats made more reference memory errors than SD, however, SHR showed minimal improvement over weeks. The increase in errors may be due to a greater inclination of SHR and WKY to use a chaining strategy of entering consecutive arms than SD. Furthermore, the number of incomplete arm entries into reference memory arms decreased over weeks in WKY and SD, but increased in SHR, suggesting increased impulsivity of SHR at the later stages of testing. Although based on number of errors, the data indicate that SHR may have memory deficits, the data relating to arm entries suggest that the minimal improvement in SHR over weeks may have been due to greater impulsivity in the later weeks, rather than defective memory. Thus, these findings are consistent with SHR having impairments with selection of appropriate behavioural responses in a goal-directed task.",The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is a commonly used animal model of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

"Adenosine acting on A(1) receptors has been related with neuroprotective and neuromodulatory actions, protection against oxidative stress and decrease of anxiety and nociceptive signaling. Previous studies demonstrated an inhibition of the enzymes that hydrolyze ATP to adenosine in the rat central nervous system after hyperthyroidism induction. Manifestations of hyperthyroidism include increased anxiety, nervousness, high O(2) consumption and physical hyperactivity. Here, we investigated the effects of administration of a specific agonist of adenosine A(1) receptor (N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine; CPA) on nociception, anxiety, exploratory response, locomotion and brain oxidative stress of hyperthyroid rats. Hyperthyroidism was induced by daily intraperitoneal injections of l-thyroxine (T4) for 14 days. Nociception was assessed with a tail-flick apparatus and exploratory behavior, locomotion and anxiety were analyzed by open-field and plus-maze tests. We verified the total antioxidant reactivity (TAR), lipid peroxide levels by the thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) reaction and the free radicals content by the DCF test. Our results demonstrated that CPA reverted the hyperalgesia induced by hyperthyroidism and decreased the exploratory behavior, locomotion and anxiety in hyperthyroid rats. Furthermore, CPA decreased lipid peroxidation in hippocampus and cerebral cortex of control rats and in cerebral cortex of hyperthyroid rats. CPA also increased the total antioxidant reactivity in hippocampus and cerebral cortex of control and hyperthyroid rats, but the production of free radicals verified by the DCF test was changed only in cerebral cortex. These results suggest that some of the hyperthyroidism effects are subjected to regulation by adenosine A(1) receptor, demonstrating the involvement of the adenosinergic system in this pathology.","Adenosine acting on A(1) receptors has been related with neuroprotective and neuromodulatory actions, protection against oxidative stress and decrease of anxiety and nociceptive signaling.

"The effects of three types of behavior on c-fos activation in different brain regions of the mudskipper, Periophthalmus cantonensis, were studied by immunocytochemistry. Animals were divided into four groups: The control group did not undergo any specific treatment. The second group consisted of animals that were agitated for an hour with a glass rod at an irregular speed. The third group contained animals showing aggressive behavior during an hour of monitoring, i.e. documented territorial hostility by raising of dorsal fins and pursuit of intruders. In contrast to these three groups, which had last been fed 24h earlier, the fourth group included animals that had been nourished 1h prior to sacrifice. Results showed that, in most brain regions of control animals, there were relatively few c-fos positive cells. After fish had been agitated, however, very prominent c-fos label was seen in the lateral and medial parts of the telencephalon, the thalamus, hypothalamus, pituitary and medulla. In aggressive fish, a significant increase in the number of c-fos positive sites, as compared to control fish, was observed in the diencephalons, pons and medulla, but not in the telencephalon. After feeding, there was a less substantial increase in c-fos protein expression in the diencephalon, but an even more prominent c-fos activation in the pons and medulla. Our present results support the hypothesis that, in fish, the medial telencephalon is involved in avoidance reaction and the lateral telencephalon in spatial memory, whereas rhombencephalic activation may reflect activity of cranial nerve nuclei.","The effects of three types of behavior on c-fos activation in different brain regions of the mudskipper, Periophthalmus cantonensis, were studied by immunocytochemistry.","Animals were divided into four groups: The control group did not undergo any specific treatment.

"The serotonin 1A (5-HT(1A)) receptor is one of the best described receptor subtypes of the serotonergic system. Due to the complex distribution pattern, the pre- and postsynaptic localisation, the impact on various monoamines, as well as the influence on a wide range of physiological functions, the contribution of 5-HT(1A) receptors to behavioural outcomes is difficult to define. In this study, we present a new transgenic mouse model with a prominent over-expression of the 5-HT(1A) receptor in the outer cortical layers (I-III) and the dentate gyrus. Behavioural studies revealed a slight decrease in baseline motor activity of homozygous mice during the open field test. Moreover, core body temperature of male transgenic mice was significantly lower than that of wild-type mice. Pharmacological studies with the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.1-2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) revealed an exaggerated drug response in mutant mice. 8-OH-DPAT led to a drastic decrease in motor activity in the open field and elevated plus maze test. This significant effect on motor activity became more apparent by investigating the serotonergic syndrome induced by 8-OH-DPAT. Concentration as low as 0.5 mg/kg 8-OH-DPAT caused immobility in transgenic mice for 30 min, head weaving behaviour, and backward walking, whereas in wild-type animals, typical behaviours of the serotonin syndrome were first observed at concentrations of 1.5 mg/kg and more. In addition, the 8-OH-DPAT induced hypothermia was more pronounced in mutant mice than in wild-type animals. Therefore, these genetically modified mice represent a promising model for further investigations of the role of 5-HT(1A) receptors.","The serotonin 1A (5-HT(1A)) receptor is one of the best described receptor subtypes of the serotonergic system.

"Development of visual lateralisation was studied in zebrafish larvae of an outbred strain when examining their own reflection in a mirror. There was significant left eye preference at all ages studied. A decrease in left eye use around 14 days, followed by a later increase at 21 days, parallels similar but differently timed shifts in the domestic chick. Age-dependent shifts in the likelihood of control by one or other eye system may be responsible. Larvae tested at 26 days of age with unfamiliar conspecifics of similar age also used the left eye (LE). Larvae of another strain (TupLF) also LE viewing of their reflection, although this was confined to the first or first and second minutes of the test rather than lasting through 10 min. The reflection differs from prior experience of fellows in the timing and character of its movements relative to those of the larva. Specialisation of the left eye system for the assessment of novelty, which is present in zebrafish, just as in many other vertebrates, probably therefore explains left eye use in the mirror test. Reasons why strains might differ in the length of time that they devote to assessment of the reflection are discussed.",Development of visual lateralisation was studied in zebrafish larvae of an outbred strain when examining their own reflection in a mirror.,"Larvae tested at 26 days of age with unfamiliar conspecifics of similar age also used the left eye (LE).

"Using a conditioning paradigm, the olfactory sensitivity of CD-1 mice for a homologous series of aliphatic aldehydes (n-butanal to n-nonanal) was investigated. With all six odorants, the animals significantly discriminated concentrations below 4 ppb (parts per billion) from the odorless solvent, and with n-butanal, n-heptanal, and n-nonanal the best-scoring animals were even able to detect concentrations below 40 ppt (parts per trillion). The results showed (a) CD-1 mice to have a well-developed olfactory sensitivity for aliphatic aldehydes which for the majority of substances is higher than that of other mammalian species, (b) a limited concentration range of about 1 log unit from threshold to near saturation which is similar to that shown at the single receptor cell level, (c) no significant correlation between perceptibility in terms of olfactory detection thresholds and carbon chain length of the aldehydes tested, and (d) no systematic effect of preexposure to an aldehyde on sensitivity. These findings suggest that CD-1 mice are highly sensitive to non-pheromonal odorants that are abundant in plant odors. Further, the results demonstrate that sensitivity for members of a homologous series of substances is not a simple function of vapor pressure as threshold values did not correlate with molecular weight. These threshold data may provide useful information for the choice of adequate stimulus concentrations in electrophysiological or imaging studies of the olfactory system or investigations of the discriminative abilities of the mouse.","Using a conditioning paradigm, the olfactory sensitivity of CD-1 mice for a homologous series of aliphatic aldehydes (n-butanal to n-nonanal) was investigated.","With all six odorants, the animals significantly discriminated concentrations below 4 ppb (parts per billion) from the odorless solvent, and with n-butanal, n-heptanal, and n-nonanal the best-scoring animals were even able to detect concentrations below 40 ppt (parts per trillion).","The results showed (a) CD-1 mice to have a well-developed olfactory sensitivity for aliphatic aldehydes which for the majority of substances is higher than that of other mammalian species, (b) a limited concentration range of about 1 log unit from threshold to near saturation which is similar to that shown at the single receptor cell level, (c) no significant correlation between perceptibility in terms of olfactory detection thresholds and carbon chain length of the aldehydes tested, and (d) no systematic effect of preexposure to an aldehyde on sensitivity.

"Behavioural and hormonal seasonal changes are well documented in various vertebrate species living in their natural environment but circannual variations that may occur in laboratory animals reared in standard conditions are poorly investigated. This study shows that, in laboratory mice, the effects of stress on behavioural inhibition, investigatory behaviour and blood concentration of corticosterone are seasonally dependent. No consistency was observed between the reactivity of biological structures controlling the hormonal response to stress and the behavioural activities investigated at every period of the year. During the spring time, stress, which elicited a decrease of investigatory behaviour (estimated by the walking time in an open field), increased behavioural inhibition (estimated by the percentage of walking in the central area of the open field) as well as the blood corticosterone concentration in laboratory mice. In autumn, stress had no significant effect on behaviour despite the great hormonal concentration increase. The results reveal that, at certain period of the year, a stressful procedure is unable to affect behavioural parameters in laboratory mice which were maintained in constant 12-h dark/12-h light cycle. The report constitutes a novel piece of information suggesting a potential role of the endogenous biological clock in the modulation of stress response in mammals.",Behavioural and hormonal seasonal changes are well documented in various vertebrate species living in their natural environment but circannual variations that may occur in laboratory animals reared in standard conditions are poorly investigated.,"This study shows that, in laboratory mice, the effects of stress on behavioural inhibition, investigatory behaviour and blood concentration of corticosterone are seasonally dependent.

"The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) has been implicated in both inflammatory processes and nociceptive neurotransmission. To further investigate the role of IL-1 in different pain states, gene-disrupted mice lacking both IL-1alpha and IL-1beta genes (IL-1alphabeta (-/-)) were characterized in inflammatory, neuropathic, and post-operative pain models. IL-1alphabeta (-/-) mice showed normal sensorimotor function as measured by the rotorod assay compared to control mice (BALB/c). Acute and persistent formalin-induced nocifensive behaviors were reduced by 20% in IL-1alphabeta (-/-) mice as compared to control mice. IL-1alphabeta (-/-) mice also showed reduced inflammatory thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia compared to controls following the intraplantar administration of carrageenan or complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). The duration of inflammatory hyperalgesia was shortened in IL-1alphabeta (-/-) mice versus controls in the CFA model. In contrast, deletion of IL-1alphabeta did not change the extent or the duration of post-operative pain developing after skin incision of the hind paw. Finally, time to onset, duration, and magnitude of mechanical allodynia were reduced in two models of neuropathic pain, spinal nerve L5-L6 ligation and chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve, in IL-1alphabeta (-/-) mice versus controls. These results demonstrate that IL-1alphabeta modulates both the generation and the maintenance of inflammatory and chronic neuropathic pain and that IL-1 may modulate nociceptive sensitivity to a greater extent in conditions of chronic as compared to acute pain.","The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) has been implicated in both inflammatory processes and nociceptive neurotransmission.

"The effects of SB-269970, a selective 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist, on spontaneous sleep were studied in adult rats implanted for chronic sleep recordings. SB-269970 was infused directly into the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) during the light phase. The 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist (0.25-1.0 mM) induced a significant reduction of REM sleep and of the number of REM periods whereas REM sleep latency was augmented. Pretreatment with the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol (1.0-2.0 mM), which by itself did not affect sleep variables, prevented the decrease of REM sleep induced by SB-269970 (1.0 mM). Our results indicate that the 5-HT(7) receptor is involved in the effect of DRN serotonergic (5-HT) neurons on brainstem structures that act to promote and induce REM sleep. We propose that the SB-269970-induced suppression of REM sleep is dependent upon the inhibition of GABA release in the DRN.","The effects of SB-269970, a selective 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist, on spontaneous sleep were studied in adult rats implanted for chronic sleep recordings.","SB-269970 was infused directly into the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) during the light phase.

"We analysed spatial and temporal characteristics of mouse locomotion and investigated whether mouse gait differed between strains and environments. To this end, we used two inbred strains of mice (BALB/cByJ and C57BL/6J) known for their contrasting inherent level of anxiety, in three different visual surroundings. The animal position was determined relative to each environment. Gait cycle, defined as the sequence of limb movements, was analysed relative to time. We also recorded spatial parameters of gait such as stride length, track width and footfall characteristics. These measures allowed us to obtain an accurate description of locomotion and to assess subtle modifications of the gait. We found that mice adjusted their position in space, posture and gait in order to either stabilize their body on the ground in a potentially unsafe environment, or to optimize propulsion and maneuverability in a safer location. In addition, the two strains of mice used different strategies, suggesting that the inherent level of emotionality may affect the organization of locomotion in mice. We further concluded that higher structures of the central nervous system are involved in the online control of locomotion.","We analysed spatial and temporal characteristics of mouse locomotion and investigated whether mouse gait differed between strains and environments.

"The effects of bilateral chemical lesions of the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and the surrounding areas in the medial striatum) and arcopallium (major descending area of the avian telencephalon) were examined in 1-2-weeks old domestic chicks. Using a Y-maze, we analyzed the lesion effects on the choices that subject chicks made in two tasks with identical economical consequences, i.e., a small-and-close food reward vs. a large-and-distant food reward. In task 1, red, yellow, and green beads were associated with a feeder placed at various distances from the chicks; chicks thus anticipated the spatial proximity of food by the bead's color, whereas the quantity of the food was fixed. In task 2, red and yellow flags on the feeders were associated with various amount of food; the chicks thus anticipated the quantity of food by the flag's color, whereas the proximity of the reward could be directly visually determined. In task 1, bilateral lesions of the ventral striatum (but not the arcopallium) enhanced the impulsiveness of the chicks' choices, suggesting that choices based on the anticipated proximity were selectively changed. In task 2, similar lesions of the ventral striatum did not change choices. In both experiments, motor functions of the chicks remained unchanged, suggesting that the lesions did not affect the foraging efficiency, i.e., objective values of food. Neural correlates of anticipated food rewards in the ventral striatum (but not those in the arcopallium) could allow chicks to invest appropriate amount of work-cost in approaching distant food resources.","The effects of bilateral chemical lesions of the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and the surrounding areas in the medial striatum) and arcopallium (major descending area of the avian telencephalon) were examined in 1-2-weeks old domestic chicks.

"Stimulation with natural contact calls and feeding were used to assess zenk and fos protein expression in budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), a vocal learning parrot species in which feeding and physical contact often occur in conjunction with vocalization. Although only calls induced gene expression in Field L, the primary telencephalic auditory area, both calls and feeding induced gene expression in the frontal lateral nidopallium (NFl), a brain area in receipt of input from Field L which projects to areas afferent to vocal control nuclei and which is necessary for new call learning. NFl thus appears poised to provide both non-auditory as well as auditory feedback to the vocal system.","Stimulation with natural contact calls and feeding were used to assess zenk and fos protein expression in budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), a vocal learning parrot species in which feeding and physical contact often occur in conjunction with vocalization.","Although only calls induced gene expression in Field L, the primary telencephalic auditory area, both calls and feeding induced gene expression in the frontal lateral nidopallium (NFl), a brain area in receipt of input from Field L which projects to areas afferent to vocal control nuclei and which is necessary for new call learning.",NFl thus appears poised to provide both non-auditory as well as auditory feedback to the vocal system.,1,1,1,NFl thus appears poised to inhibit both non-auditory as well as auditory feedback to the vocal system.
"The present experiment tested the hypothesis that facilitation of striatal function with intra-striatal glucose injections would facilitate learning a striatum-dependent response maze and impair learning a hippocampus-dependent place maze. Food-deprived Sprague-Dawley male rats were trained to find food in a Y-maze. In the place version of the maze, rats were rewarded for learning to go to an arm located in a fixed location while in the response task rats were rewarded for consistently turning in the same direction at the choice point. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid (1 microL) containing either 0.7 nmol of glucose (control) or 20 nmol of glucose was injected bilaterally into the dorsal striatum immediately before training. The animals were trained to a criterion of 9/10 correct choices. In the place maze, glucose injections impaired learning, as measured by number of trials required to reach 9/10 correct. However, in the response task, glucose injections did not enhance learning. A subsequent experiment examined the effects of intra-striatal glucose injections on acquisition of the response task under two different visual cue conditions, addition of an intra-maze light cue that predicted the correct arm or with removal of most visual extramaze cues. Glucose again failed to facilitate acquisition of the response task under these conditions. These findings suggest that facilitation of striatal function via intra-striatal glucose injections is sufficient to impair place learning but not to enhance response learning, perhaps separating the neurochemical mechanisms for striatal involvement in impairment of place and enhancement of response learning.",The present experiment tested the hypothesis that facilitation of striatal function with intra-striatal glucose injections would facilitate learning a striatum-dependent response maze and impair learning a hippocampus-dependent place maze.,"Food-deprived Sprague-Dawley male rats were trained to find food in a Y-maze.

"In a recent retrograde tracing study in the squirrel monkey, we found that regions in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) producing different call types when pharmacologically stimulated, receive their input largely from the same structures. The aim of the present study was to find out, whether there are quantitative differences in this input. For this reason, we counted retrogradely labeled neurons in various brain regions after injections of wheatgerm agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into three different vocalization-eliciting PAG sites: one site producing non-aversive contact calls (clucking); a second site producing slightly aversive social mobbing calls (cackling); and a third site producing highly aversive defensive threat calls (shrieking). Cell counting was carried out by the help of the optical fractionator technique. Six squirrel monkeys were used, two for each call type. In some regions, marked differences in the number of retrogradely labeled cells between the three call type groups occured. Such regions are the nucl. accumbens, preoptic area, posterior hypothalamus, anterior cingulate cortex, subcallosal gyrus and the nucl. striae terminalis. In some of these regions, the number of retrogradely labeled cells correlated positively (posterior hypothalamus) or negatively (preoptic area, nucl. striae terminalis) with the ""aversiveness"" of the elicited call type. Other regions of interest, e.g., the dorsomedial prefrontal and precallosal cortex, amygdala and hypothalamic regions surrounding the fornix, revealed no clear differences in their afferent projections to the different vocalization-eliciting PAG sites. The results make clear that distinct vocalization-controlling regions in the PAG receive a qualitatively similar but quantitatively differentiated input.","In a recent retrograde tracing study in the squirrel monkey, we found that regions in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) producing different call types when pharmacologically stimulated, receive their input largely from the same structures.

"The objective of the present study was to determine whether a systematic optimization of Morris water maze (mwm) testing parameters could reveal a significant role of the septohippocampal cholinergic system in spatial working memory. Young adult rats were lesioned using 192 IgG-saporin infused bilaterally into the medial septum. Lesions were near complete as measured by choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and immunohistochemistry. Behavioral testing was performed in three phases. In the first, lesioned and unlesioned rats were trained in the mwm focusing on working memory, which was tested using novel platform locations daily. In the second phase, the optimal locations were retested with increasing intertrial intervals (ITI). In the third phase, intracerebroventricular infusions of nerve growth factor (NGF) were employed to enhance cholinergic activity of the unlesioned rats and potentially further separate group performance. Neither the standard or increased ITI resulted in a consistent significant difference in spatial working memory between groups. In addition, NGF treatment also failed to induce a significant difference in behavioral performance. In conclusion, impairments in working memory as assessed by the mwm could not be revealed despite a greater than 90% loss of hippocampal ChAT and the use of optimal testing parameters and NGF treatment.",The objective of the present study was to determine whether a systematic optimization of Morris water maze (mwm) testing parameters could reveal a significant role of the septohippocampal cholinergic system in spatial working memory.,"Young adult rats were lesioned using 192 IgG-saporin infused bilaterally into the medial septum.

"Birth complications such as perinatal asphyxia are considered risk factors for later neurobehavioural disorders. Behavioural analysis of animal models may help to clarify the contribution of particular patterns of early hypoxia and their combination to psychiatric morbidity. Wistar rats underwent caesarean section (c-section) alone or c-section followed by asphyxia, the latter induced by placing pups still in uterus horns into a water bath at 37 degrees C for 20 min. Vaginally delivered pups were used as controls. Frequency of ultrasound emissions was analysed following isolation at a lower temperature than that of the home nest (23+/-0.5 degrees C) and reunion with their mother (3 min) on postnatal day (PND) 13 (maternal potentiation test). A sex-dependent effect of hypoxia was observed, with higher production of ultrasounds in hypoxic males. Caesarean-delivered pups produced significantly more ultrasounds than those vaginally delivered. At adolescence (PND 35) rats underwent a 25 min social interaction test with a conspecific of the same sex and age. Significant alterations in investigative behaviour (inclusive of: nose, anogenital, body sniffing, and following) were evident in caesarean-delivered rats of both sexes, but not in rats experiencing perinatal asphyxia. At adulthood, auditory, and context conditioned responses, analysed in a fear conditioning test, were not markedly affected either by c-section or c-section plus hypoxia. However, hypoxic rats emitted significantly more 22 kHz ultrasounds than c-section or vaginally delivered rats during the training session. In conclusion, differential effects appear to be brought about by c-section and by hypoxia mainly related to emotional/anxious responses.",Birth complications such as perinatal asphyxia are considered risk factors for later neurobehavioural disorders.

"We showed that the relationship between cytokine mRNA in the rat brain and elevated plus-maze behaviour is site- (striatum, prefrontal cortex), and cytokine-specific (interleukin-2). Here, we investigated whether a striatal microinjection of interleukin-2 (1, 10, 25 ng) affects elevated plus-maze behaviour. Analyses showed no acute effects of IL-2 on open arm time, whereas dose-dependent differences in rearing activity, and open arm entries became apparent between IL-2 doses. Twenty-four hours later, a previous dose of 25 ng IL-2 showed a trend for more open arm time compared to vehicle. These behavioural changes are discussed in relation to anxiety-relevant and exploratory behaviour, and possible neurochemical mechanisms.","We showed that the relationship between cytokine mRNA in the rat brain and elevated plus-maze behaviour is site- (striatum, prefrontal cortex), and cytokine-specific (interleukin-2).","Here, we investigated whether a striatal microinjection of interleukin-2 (1, 10, 25 ng) affects elevated plus-maze behaviour.","Analyses showed no acute effects of IL-2 on open arm time, whereas dose-dependent differences in rearing activity, and open arm entries became apparent between IL-2 doses.

"Emission of 50 kHz ultrasonic calls in rats is known to be associated with appetitive behavioural situations and positive social interactions. The purpose of the study was to pharmacologically characterize amphetamine-induced 50 kHz calls and to perform quantitative mapping of this response in the nucleus accumbens. Injections of amphetamine into the nucleus accumbens induced species-typical 50 kHz calls in adult rats. The acoustic parameters of the calls were not affected by different amphetamine doses or combination of agents. The increase in the number of calls occurred predominantly from the accumbens shell and to a lesser degree from the core region. This effect was dose-dependent within the range of 1-20 microg of amphetamine and was reversed by pretreatment with D1 or D2 dopamine antagonists (SKF-83566 or raclopride) administered to the same brain site. However, another D2 dopamine receptor antagonist, haloperidol, which is known to increase the accumbens dopamine level, was ineffective in reversing the increase in call number at the dose studied. On the contrary, intraacumbens haloperidol, when injected alone, caused an increase in 50 kHz calls. It is concluded that the release of dopamine, predominantly in the accumbens shell region, is responsible for production of 50 kHz calls and the calls may indicate an appetitive state compatible with anticipation of reward and positive affect. Both D1 and D2 subtypes of dopamine receptors may be necessary to induce 50 kHz calls and signal the appetitive state.",Emission of 50 kHz ultrasonic calls in rats is known to be associated with appetitive behavioural situations and positive social interactions.
