"Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have often been reported to have difficulty integrating information into its broader context, which has motivated the Weak Central Coherence theory of ASD. In the linguistic domain, evidence for this difficulty comes from reports of impaired use of linguistic context to resolve ambiguous words. However, recent work has suggested that impaired use of linguistic context may not be characteristic of ASD, and is instead better explained by co-occurring language impairments. Here, we provide a strong test of these claims, using the visual world eye tracking paradigm to examine the online mechanisms by which children with autism resolve linguistic ambiguity. To address concerns about both language impairments and compensatory strategies, we used a sample whose verbal skills were strong and whose average age (7; 6) was lower than previous work on lexical ambiguity resolution in ASD. Participants (40 with autism and 40 controls) heard sentences with ambiguous words in contexts that either strongly supported one reading or were consistent with both (John fed/saw the bat). We measured activation of the unintended meaning through implicit semantic priming of an associate (looks to a depicted baseball glove). Contrary to the predictions of weak central coherence, children with ASD, like controls, quickly used context to resolve ambiguity, selecting appropriate meanings within a second. We discuss how these results constrain the generality of weak central coherence.","Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have often been reported to have difficulty integrating information into its broader context, which has motivated the Weak Central Coherence theory of ASD.

"Bullying victimization is commonly associated with anxiety among individuals with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and both bullying victimization and anxiety are more prevalent among youth with ASD than in the general population. We explored individual and contextual factors that relate to anxiety in adolescents and young adults with ASD who also experience bullying victimization. Participants included 101 mothers of adolescents and young adults diagnosed with ASD. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between bullying victimization and anxiety in children with ASD, as well as parenting stress as a potential moderator of that relationship. Findings indicate that parenting stress moderates the association between bullying victimization and anxiety. The severity of anxiety was most strongly associated with bullying victimization when mothers reported high levels of stress. Implications for interventions that assist parents with coping and address bullying victimization are discussed.","Bullying victimization is commonly associated with anxiety among individuals with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and both bullying victimization and anxiety are more prevalent among youth with ASD than in the general population.

"Limited perspective taking or ""Theory of Mind"" (ToM) abilities are a core deficit of autism, and many interventions are aimed to improve ToM abilities. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of a ToM treatment for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and, for the first time, the moderating roles of social interaction style (SIS) and disruptive behavior (DB), to determine which children are most likely to respond to this intervention. The trial protocol is registered at www.trialregister.nl, trial number 2327 and published before the data collection was finished (www.trialsjournal.com). Children with autism aged 7-12 years (n = 97) were randomized over a waitlist control or a treatment condition. Outcome measures included ToM and emotion understanding, parent and teacher questionnaires on children's social skills, ToM-related social behavior, and autistic traits. Six-month follow-up parent reported data were collected for the treatment group. The treatment had a positive effect on ToM understanding, parent-reported ToM behavior, and autistic traits, but not on parent or teacher-reported social behavior. Passive SIS was associated with diminished treatment effects on autistic traits, but DB was unrelated to outcomes. The ToM intervention improved conceptual social understanding and ToM-related behavior of children with ASD. However, broader application of learned skills to other domains of functioning was limited. Individual differences with regard to treatment response are discussed.","Limited perspective taking or ""Theory of Mind"" (ToM) abilities are a core deficit of autism, and many interventions are aimed to improve ToM abilities.

"Previous research has suggested that individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have difficulties understanding others communicative intent and with using contextual information to correctly interpret irony. We recorded the eye movements of typically developing (TD) adults ASD adults when they read statements that could either be interpreted as ironic or non-ironic depending on the context of the passage. Participants with ASD performed as well as TD controls in their comprehension accuracy for speaker's statements in both ironic and non-ironic conditions. Eye movement data showed that for both participant groups, total reading times were longer for the critical region containing the speaker's statement and a subsequent sentence restating the context in the ironic condition compared to the non-ironic condition. The results suggest that more effortful processing is required in both ASD and TD participants for ironic compared with literal non-ironic statements, and that individuals with ASD were able to use contextual information to infer a non-literal interpretation of ironic text. Individuals with ASD, however, spent more time overall than TD controls rereading the passages, to a similar degree across both ironic and non-ironic conditions, suggesting that they either take longer to construct a coherent discourse representation of the text, or that they take longer to make the decision that their representation of the text is reasonable based on their knowledge of the world.",Previous research has suggested that individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have difficulties understanding others communicative intent and with using contextual information to correctly interpret irony.,We recorded the eye movements of typically developing (TD) adults ASD adults when they read statements that could either be interpreted as ironic or non-ironic depending on the context of the passage.,"Participants with ASD performed as well as TD controls in their comprehension accuracy for speaker's statements in both ironic and non-ironic conditions.

"Research has demonstrated that, despite difficulties in multiple domains, children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show a lack of awareness of these difficulties. A misunderstanding of poor competencies may make it difficult for individuals to adjust their behaviour in accordance with feedback and may lead to greater impairments over time. This study examined self-perceptions of adolescents with ASD (n = 19) and typically developing (TD) mental-age-matched controls (n = 22) using actual performance on objective academic tasks as the basis for ratings. Before completing the tasks, participants were asked how well they thought they would do (pre-task prediction). After completing each task, they were asked how well they thought they did (immediate post-performance) and how well they would do in the future (hypothetical future post-performance). Adolescents with ASD had more positively biased self-perceptions of competence than TD controls. The ASD group tended to overestimate their performance on all ratings of self-perceptions (pre-task prediction, immediate, and hypothetical future post-performance). In contrast, while the TD group was quite accurate at estimating their performance immediately before and after performing the task, they showed some tendency to overestimate their future performance. Future investigation is needed to systematically examine possible mechanisms that may be contributing to these biased self-perceptions.","Research has demonstrated that, despite difficulties in multiple domains, children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show a lack of awareness of these difficulties.

"Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may present with multiple medical conditions in addition to ASD symptoms. This study investigated whether there are predictive patterns of medical conditions that co-occur with ASD, which could inform medical evaluation and treatment in ASD, as well as potentially identify etiologically meaningful subgroups. Medical history data were queried in the multiplex family Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE). Fourteen medical conditions were analyzed. Replication in the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) was attempted using available medical condition data on gastrointestinal disturbances (GID), sleep problems, allergy and epilepsy. In the AGRE cohort, no discrete clusters emerged among 14 medical conditions. GID and seizures were enriched in unaffected family members, and together with sleep problems, were represented in both AGRE and SSC. Further analysis of these medical conditions identified predictive co-occurring patterns in both samples. For a child with ASD, the presence of GID predicts sleep problems and vice versa, with an approximately 2-fold odds ratio in each direction. These risk patterns were replicated in the SSC sample, and in addition, there was increased risk for seizures and sleep problems to co-occur with GID. In these cohorts, seizure alone was not predictive of the other conditions co-occurring, but behavioral impairments were more severe as the number of co-occurring medical symptoms increased. These findings indicate that interdisciplinary clinical care for children with ASD will benefit from evaluation for specific patterns of medical conditions in the affected child and their family members.","Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may present with multiple medical conditions in addition to ASD symptoms.

"Research into memory in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) suggests intact item memory but difficulties in forming relations between items (Bowler, Gaigg, &amp; Lind, 2011). In this study, we tested memory for items as well as for sequential, spatial, and associative relations between items with the same paradigm using abstract shapes in ASD and typically developing (TD) individuals. Participants studied shape triplets on a computer screen and memory was subsequently tested either for the individual items making up the triplets, the screen-locations, the order or the combinations of items presented at study. Contrary to our predictions, performance was significantly lower in the ASD group on all four tasks. The result raises questions about how intact item memory is in ASD, which role task complexity plays, and how item-specific versus relational processing affect task performance. One possibility is that TD individuals relied more on relational processing in the current study and might have therefore had an advantage over ASD individuals. This idea is supported by the result of a preliminary analysis of age-related differences in memory across the midadult lifespan in both groups. Age seems to affect order memory less in ASD compared with TD individuals where it leads to a significant decrease in performance. This might indicate a decrease in relational processing in TD but not ASD individuals with increasing age. More research is needed to answer questions about the change in cognition in ASD individuals across the lifespan.","Research into memory in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) suggests intact item memory but difficulties in forming relations between items (Bowler, Gaigg, & Lind, 2011).","In this study, we tested memory for items as well as for sequential, spatial, and associative relations between items with the same paradigm using abstract shapes in ASD and typically developing (TD) individuals.

"There is a general consensus that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is accompanied by alterations in brain connectivity. Much of the neuroimaging work has focused on assessing long-range connectivity disruptions in ASD. However, evidence from both animal models and postmortem examination of the human brain suggests that local connections may also be disrupted in individuals with the disorder. Here, we investigated how regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measure of similarity of a voxel's timeseries to its nearest neighbors, varies across age in individuals with ASD and typically developing (TD) individuals using a cross-sectional design. Resting-state fMRI data obtained from a publicly available database were analyzed to determine group differences in ReHo between three age cohorts: children, adolescents, and adults. In typical development, ReHo across the entire brain was higher in children than in adolescents and adults. In contrast, children with ASD exhibited marginally lower ReHo than TD children, while adolescents and adults with ASD exhibited similar levels of local connectivity as age-matched neurotypical individuals. During all developmental stages, individuals with ASD exhibited lower local connectivity in sensory processing brain regions and higher local connectivity in complex information processing regions. Further, higher local connectivity in ASD corresponded to more severe ASD symptomatology. These results demonstrate that local connectivity is disrupted in ASD across development, with the most pronounced differences occurring in childhood. Developmental changes in ReHo do not mirror findings from fMRI studies of long-range connectivity in ASD, pointing to a need for more nuanced accounts of brain connectivity alterations in the disorder.","There is a general consensus that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is accompanied by alterations in brain connectivity.

"Rates of hearing impairment in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are higher than those reported in the general population. Although ASD is not caused by hearing impairment, it may exacerbate symptomatology. Participants with ASD (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;60) and typically developing peers (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;16) aged 5-18 years underwent a comprehensive audiological screening (pure tone audiometry, uncomfortable loudness level, tympanometry, acoustic reflexes, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, and auditory brainstem response) and assessment of communication abilities (expressive/receptive language, articulation, phonological awareness, and vocal affect recognition). Incidence of abnormal findings on at least one measure of audiological functioning was higher for the ASD group (55%) than controls (14.9%) or the general population estimate (6%). The presence of sound sensitivity was also considerably higher for the ASD group (37%) compared with controls (0%) or general population estimates (8-15%). When participants with ASD were dichotomized into groups with and without evidence of clinical audiological abnormality, no significant differences were identified on measures of communication; however, results of correlational analyses indicated that variability in hearing thresholds at middle range frequencies (2000 Hz) was significantly related to performance on all measures of speech articulation and language after correction for multiple comparisons (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.48 to r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.53, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009; 0.0045). These findings suggest that dichotomized classification of clinical audiology may not be sufficient to understand the role of subclinical hearing loss in ASD symptomatology and that treatment studies for mild/subclinical hearing loss in this population may be worthwhile.","Rates of hearing impairment in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are higher than those reported in the general population.

"Interpreting emotional expressions appropriately poses a challenge for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In particular, difficulties with emotional processing in ASD are more pronounced in contexts where emotional expressions are subtle, automatic, and reflexive-that is, implicit. In contrast, explicit emotional processing, which requires the cognitive evaluation of an emotional experience, appears to be relatively intact in individuals with ASD. In the present study, we examined the brain activation and functional connectivity differences underlying explicit and implicit emotional processing in age- and IQ-matched adults with (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;17) and without (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15) ASD. Results indicated: (1) significantly reduced levels of brain activation in participants with ASD in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) during implicit emotion processing; (2) significantly weaker functional connectivity in the ASD group in connections of the MPFC with the amygdala, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and fusiform gyrus; (3) No group difference in performance accuracy or reaction time; and (4) Significant positive relationship between empathizing ability and STG activity in ASD but not in typically developing participants. These findings suggest that the neural mechanisms underlying implicit, but not explicit, emotion processing may be altered at multiple levels in individuals with ASD.","Interpreting emotional expressions appropriately poses a challenge for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

"This study examined the morphology of frontal-parietal regions relevant to motor functions in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with or without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We also explored its associations with autism severity and motor skills, and the impact of comorbid ADHD on these associations. Participants included 126 school-age children: 30 had ASD only, 33 had ASD with ADHD, and 63 were typically developing. High resolution 3T MPRAGE images were acquired to examine the cortical morphology (gray matter volume, GMV, surface area, SA, and cortical thickness, CT) in three regions of interest (ROI): precentral gyrus (M1), postcentral gyrus (S1), and inferior parietal cortex (IPC). Children with ASD showed abnormal increases in GMV and SA in all three ROIs: (a) increased GMV in S1 bilaterally and in right M1 was specific to children with ASD without ADHD; (b) all children with ASD (with or without ADHD) showed increases in the left IPC SA. Furthermore, on measures of motor function, impaired praxis was associated with increased GMV in right S1 in the ASD group with ADHD. Children with ASD with ADHD showed a positive relationship between bilateral S1 GMV and manual dexterity, whereas children with ASD without ADHD showed a negative relationship. Our findings suggest that (a) ASD is associated with abnormal morphology of cortical circuits crucial to motor control and learning; (b) anomalous overgrowth of these regions, particularly S1, may contribute to impaired motor skill development, and (c) functional and morphological differences are apparent between children with ASD with or without ADHD.","This study examined the morphology of frontal-parietal regions relevant to motor functions in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with or without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

"Previous work indicates that adults with autism display a decreased capacity when rapidly enumerating small sets of elements (i.e., subitizing), compared to typically developing (TD) individuals. This ability is crucial for fundamental visual functions such as object individuation and parallel processing. Thus, the deficit in autism suggests limits in these skills. To examine the neural basis of this limitation, adults with and without high functioning autism rapidly enumerated 1 to 8 randomly located squares during a neuroimaging study. Typically, adults are thought to use parallel visual processes to quantify up to three or four elements, and serial processes to enumerate more (5+) elements. We hypothesized that parietal lobe regions associated with counting would be recruited with smaller sets of elements in adults with autism, compared to TD adults. Consistent with this hypothesis, activation in parietal regions increased with smaller set sizes in adults with autism compared to TD adults. Increased activation for three elements was evident in several regions, including those thought to underlie subitizing. In addition, regions specific to the counting range in TD adults were often equally active for set sizes in the subitizing range in the adults with autism. Finally, significant deactivation was evident in TD adults, presumably reflecting relative suppression of regions specialized for competing processes, but was not apparent in adults with autism. These differences in brain function in adults with autism on a simple enumeration task suggest atypical brain organization and function that is likely to impact most visual tasks, especially those with multiple elements.","Previous work indicates that adults with autism display a decreased capacity when rapidly enumerating small sets of elements (i.e., subitizing), compared to typically developing (TD) individuals.

"Mirror neuron system dysfunction may underlie a self-other matching impairment, which has previously been suggested to account for autism. Embodied Cognition Theory, which proposes that action provides a foundation for cognition has lent further credence to these ideas. The hypotheses of a self-other matching deficit and impaired mirror neuron function in autism have now been well supported by studies employing a range of methodologies. However, underlying mechanisms require further exploration to explain how mirror neurons may be involved in attentional and mentalizing processes. Impairments in self-other matching and mirror neuron function are not necessarily inextricably linked and it seems possible that different sub-populations of mirror neurons, located in several regions, contribute differentially to social cognitive functions. It is hypothesized that mirror neuron coding for action-direction may be required for developing attentional sensitivity to self-directed actions, and consequently for person-oriented, stimulus-driven attention. Mirror neuron networks may vary for different types of social learning such as ""automatic"" imitation and imitation learning. Imitation learning may be more reliant on self-other comparison processes (based on mirror neurons) that identify differences as well as similarities between actions. Differential connectivity with the amygdala-orbitofrontal system may also be important. This could have implications for developing ""theory of mind,"" with intentional self-other comparison being relevant to meta-representational abilities, and ""automatic"" imitation being more relevant to empathy. While it seems clear that autism is associated with impaired development of embodied aspects of cognition, the ways that mirror neurons contribute to these brain-behavior links are likely to be complex.","Mirror neuron system dysfunction may underlie a self-other matching impairment, which has previously been suggested to account for autism.

"Previous research has suggested that people with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) may have difficulty with visual perspective taking (VPT) but it is not clear how this relates to different strategies that can be used in perspective taking tasks. The current study examined VPT in 30 children with autism and 30 verbal mental age matched typical children, in comparison to mental rotation (MR) abilities and body representation abilities. Using a similar paradigm to Hamilton, Brindley, and Frith [2009] all children completed three tasks: a VPT task in which children decided what a toy on a table would look like from a different points of view; a MR task in which the child decided what a toy would look like after it had been rotated; and a body posture matching task, in which children matched pictures of a body shown from different viewpoints. Results showed that children with ASC performed better than the typically developing children on the MR task, and at a similar level on the VPT task and body matching task. Importantly, in the typical children VPT performance was predicted by performance on the body matching task, whereas in the ASC children VPT performance was predicted by MR ability. These findings suggest that differences in VPT in ASC may be explained by the use of a spatial rotation strategy rather than the embodied egocentric transformation strategy used by typical children.",Previous research has suggested that people with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) may have difficulty with visual perspective taking (VPT) but it is not clear how this relates to different strategies that can be used in perspective taking tasks.,"The current study examined VPT in 30 children with autism and 30 verbal mental age matched typical children, in comparison to mental rotation (MR) abilities and body representation abilities.

"Rare de novo and inherited copy number variations (CNVs) have been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk. However, the genetic underpinnings of ASD remain unknown in more than 80% of cases. Therefore, identification of novel candidate genes and corroboration of known candidate genes may broaden the horizons of determining genetic risk alleles, and subsequent development of diagnostic testing. Here, using genotyping arrays, we characterized the genetic architecture of rare CNVs (&lt;1% frequency) in a Finnish case-control dataset. Unsurprisingly, ASD cases harbored a significant excess of rare, large (&gt;1 Mb) CNVs and rare, exonic CNVs. The exonic rare de novo CNV rate (&#x223c;22.5%) seemed higher compared to previous reports. We identified several CNVs in well-known ASD regions including GSTM1-5, DISC1, FHIT, RBFOX1, CHRNA7, 15q11.2, 15q13.2-q13.3, 17q12, and 22q11.21. Additionally, several novel candidate genes (BDKRB1, BDKRB2, AP2M1, SPTA1, PTH1R, CYP2E1, PLCD3, F2RL1, UQCRC2, LILRB3, RPS9, and COL11A2) were identified through gene prioritization. The majority of these genes belong to neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathways, and calcium signaling pathways, thus suggesting that a subset of these novel candidate genes may contribute to ASD risk. Furthermore, several metabolic pathways like caffeine metabolism, drug metabolism, retinol metabolism, and calcium-signaling pathway were found to be affected by the rare exonic ASD CNVs. Additionally, biological processes such as bradykinin receptor activity, endoderm formation and development, and oxidoreductase activity were enriched among the rare exonic ASD CNVs. Overall, our findings may add data about new genes and pathways that contribute to the genetic architecture of ASD.","Rare de novo and inherited copy number variations (CNVs) have been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk.

"Deficits in language comprehension have been widely reported in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), with behavioral and neuroimaging studies finding increased reliance on visuospatial processing to aid in language comprehension. However, no study to date, has taken advantage of this strength in visuospatial processing to improve language comprehension difficulties in ASD. This study used a translational neuroimaging approach to test the role of a visual imagery-based reading intervention in improving the brain circuitry underlying language processing in children with ASD. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in a longitudinal study design, was used to investigate intervention-related change in sentence comprehension, brain activation, and functional connectivity in three groups of participants (age 8-13 years): an experimental group of ASD children (ASD-EXP), a wait-list control group of ASD children (ASD-WLC), and a group of typically developing control children. After intervention, the ASD-EXP group showed significant increase in activity in visual and language areas and right-hemisphere language area homologues, putamen, and thalamus, suggestive of compensatory routes to increase proficiency in reading comprehension. Additionally, ASD children who had the most improvement in reading comprehension after intervention showed greater functional connectivity between left-hemisphere language areas, the middle temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus while reading high imagery sentences. Thus, the findings of this study, which support the principles of dual coding theory [Paivio 2007], suggest the potential of a strength-based reading intervention in changing brain responses and facilitating better reading comprehension in ASD children.","Deficits in language comprehension have been widely reported in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), with behavioral and neuroimaging studies finding increased reliance on visuospatial processing to aid in language comprehension.

"Although sexuality plays a major role in the socialization of people, few studies have examined the sexual behaviors of individuals with developmental disabilities. Because of this, we decided to investigate sexuality in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Down's syndrome (Ds) and to compare them with typically developing adolescents, by surveying their parents. Specifically, it was hypothesized that young people with ASD would display lower levels over five domains: social behavior, privacy, sex education, sexual behavior, and parental concerns, than peers with Ds and typically developing young people. In addition, we sought to verify developmental trends in five domains with age for each group. Overall, 269 parents participated; 94 parents of typically developing adolescents, 93 parents of adolescents diagnosed with Ds, and 82 parents of adolescents diagnosed with ASD. Participants were surveyed with a Sexual Behavior Scale developed by Stokes and Kaur [] that assesses parents' reports of their child's: social behavior, privacy awareness, sex education, sexual behavior and parental concerns about the child's behaviors. It was found that three groups were significantly different on all five domains, adolescents with ASD reportedly displaying lower levels than other groups. Moreover, there was a significant improvement in knowledge of privacy and parental concerns with age for adolescents with ASD and a decline in sex education for adolescents with Ds. The results obtained emphasize the need to train adolescents with developmental disability, and especially for adolescents with ASD through sex education programs.","Although sexuality plays a major role in the socialization of people, few studies have examined the sexual behaviors of individuals with developmental disabilities.

"Although sensory problems, including tactile hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity (DSM-5) are commonly associated with autism, there is a dearth of systematic and rigorous research in this domain. Here, we report findings from a psychophysical experiment that explored differences in tactile perception between individuals with autism and typically developing control participants, who, using their index finger, rated a series of surfaces on the extent of their roughness. Each surface was rated multiple times and we calculated both the average rating and the variability across trials. Relative to controls, the individuals with autism perceived the surfaces as rougher overall and exhibited greater variability in their ratings across trials. These findings characterize altered tactile perception in autism and suggest that sensory problems in autism may be the product of overly responsive and variable sensory processing.","Although sensory problems, including tactile hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity (DSM-5) are commonly associated with autism, there is a dearth of systematic and rigorous research in this domain.","Here, we report findings from a psychophysical experiment that explored differences in tactile perception between individuals with autism and typically developing control participants, who, using their index finger, rated a series of surfaces on the extent of their roughness.

"Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often show atypical processing of facial expressions, which may result from visual stress.

"The difficulties encountered by individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) when interacting with neurotypical (NT, i.e. nonautistic) individuals are usually attributed to failure to recognize the emotions and mental states of their NT interaction partner. It is also possible, however, that at least some of the difficulty is due to a failure of NT individuals to read the mental and emotional states of ASD interaction partners. Previous research has frequently observed deficits of typical facial emotion recognition in individuals with ASD, suggesting atypical representations of emotional expressions. Relatively little research, however, has investigated the ability of individuals with ASD to produce recognizable emotional expressions, and thus, whether NT individuals can recognize autistic emotional expressions. The few studies which have investigated this have used only NT observers, making it impossible to determine whether atypical representations are shared among individuals with ASD, or idiosyncratic. This study investigated NT and ASD participants' ability to recognize emotional expressions produced by NT and ASD posers. Three posing conditions were included, to determine whether potential group differences are due to atypical cognitive representations of emotion, impaired understanding of the communicative value of expressions, or poor proprioceptive feedback. Results indicated that ASD expressions were recognized less well than NT expressions, and that this is likely due to a genuine deficit in the representation of typical emotional expressions in this population. Further, ASD expressions were equally poorly recognized by NT individuals and those with ASD, implicating idiosyncratic, rather than common, atypical representations of emotional expressions in ASD.","The difficulties encountered by individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) when interacting with neurotypical (NT, i.e. nonautistic) individuals are usually attributed to failure to recognize the emotions and mental states of their NT interaction partner.

"Although children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show atypical sensory processing, evidence for impaired integration of multisensory information has been mixed. In this study, we took a Bayesian model-based approach to assess within-modality integration of congruent and incongruent texture and disparity cues to judge slant in typical and autistic adolescents. Human adults optimally combine multiple sources of sensory information to reduce perceptual variance but in typical development this ability to integrate cues does not develop until late childhood. While adults cannot help but integrate cues, even when they are incongruent, young children's ability to keep cues separate gives them an advantage in discriminating incongruent stimuli. Given that mature cue integration emerges in later childhood, we hypothesized that typical adolescents would show adult-like integration, combining both congruent and incongruent cues. For the ASD group there were three possible predictions (1) ""no fusion"": no integration of congruent or incongruent cues, like 6-year-old typical children; (2) ""mandatory fusion"": integration of congruent and incongruent cues, like typical adults; (3) ""selective fusion"": cues are combined when congruent but not incongruent, consistent with predictions of Enhanced Perceptual Functioning (EPF) theory. As hypothesized, typical adolescents showed significant integration of both congruent and incongruent cues. The ASD group showed results consistent with ""selective fusion,"" integrating congruent but not incongruent cues. This allowed adolescents with ASD to make perceptual judgments which typical adolescents could not. In line with EPF, results suggest that perception in ASD may be more flexible and less governed by mandatory top-down feedback.","Although children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show atypical sensory processing, evidence for impaired integration of multisensory information has been mixed.

"Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, likely encompassing multiple pathogenetic components. The aim of this study is to begin identifying at least some of these components and to assess their association with biological endophenotypes. To address this issue, we recruited 245 Italian patients with idiopathic autism spectrum disorders and their first-degree relatives. Using a stepwise approach, patient and family history variables were analyzed using principal component analysis (""exploratory phase""), followed by intra- and inter-component cross-correlation analyses (""follow-up phase""), and by testing for association between each component and biological endophenotypes, namely head circumference, serotonin blood levels, and global urinary peptide excretion rates (""biological correlation phase""). Four independent components were identified, namely ""circadian &amp; sensory dysfunction,"" ""immune dysfunction,"" ""neurodevelopmental delay,"" and ""stereotypic behavior,"" together representing 74.5% of phenotypic variance in our sample. Marker variables in the latter three components are positively associated with macrocephaly, global peptiduria, and serotonin blood levels, respectively. These four components point toward at least four processes associated with autism, namely (I) a disruption of the circadian cycle associated with behavioral and sensory abnormalities, (II) dysreactive immune processes, surprisingly linked both to prenatal obstetric complications and to excessive postnatal body growth rates, (III) a generalized developmental delay, and (IV) an abnormal neural circuitry underlying stereotypies and early social behaviors.","Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, likely encompassing multiple pathogenetic components.

"Previous research suggests that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show a detail-focused cognitive style. The aim of the current longitudinal study was to investigate whether this detail-focused cognitive style in childhood predicted a higher symptom severity of repetitive and restrictive behaviors and interests (RRBI) in adolescence. The Childhood Embedded Figures Test (CEFT) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) were administered in 87 children with ASD at the age of 6-12 years old (T1), and the ADOS was readministered 7 years later when the participants were 12-19 years old (T2). Linear regression analyses were performed to investigate whether accuracy and reaction time in the complex versus simple CEFT condition and performance in the complex condition predicted T2 ADOS RRBI calibrated severity scores (CSS), while taking into consideration relevant covariates and ADOS RRBI CSS at T1. The CEFT performance (accuracy in the complex condition divided by the time needed) significantly predicted higher ADOS RRBI CSS at T2 (&#x394;R(2) &#x2009;=&#x2009;15%). This finding further supports the detail-focused cognitive style in individuals with ASD, and shows that it is also predictive of future RRBI symptoms over time.",Previous research suggests that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show a detail-focused cognitive style.

"A lack of imitative behavior is frequently described as a core feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and is consistent with claims of mirror neuron system dysfunction in these individuals. Previous research has questioned this characterization of ASD however, arguing that when tests of automatic imitation are used--which do not require higher-level cognitive processing--imitative behavior is intact or even enhanced in individuals with ASD. In Experiment 1, 60 adult individuals with ASD and a matched Control group completed an automatic imitation task in which they were required to perform an index or a middle finger lift while observing a hand making either the same, or the alternate, finger movement. Both groups demonstrated a significant imitation effect whereby actions were executed faster when preceded by observation of the same action, than when preceded by the alternate action. The magnitude of this ""imitation effect"" was statistically indistinguishable in the ASD and Control groups. Experiment 2 utilized an improved automatic imitation paradigm to demonstrate that, when automatic imitation effects are isolated from those due to spatial compatibility, increasing autism symptom severity is associated with an increased tendency to imitate. Notably, there was no association between autism symptom severity and spatial compatibility, demonstrating the specificity of the link between ASD symptoms and increased imitation. These results provide evidence against claims of a lack of imitative behavior in ASD, and challenge the ""Broken Mirror Theory of Autism.""","A lack of imitative behavior is frequently described as a core feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and is consistent with claims of mirror neuron system dysfunction in these individuals.

"The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) has been proposed for screening of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in clinical settings. Given the already widespread use of the CBCL, this could have great implications for clinical practice. This study examined the utility of CBCL profiles in differentiating children with ASD from children with other clinical disorders. Participants were 226 children with ASD and 163 children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, intellectual disability, language disorders, or emotional disorders, aged 2-13 years. Diagnosis was based on comprehensive clinical evaluation including well-validated diagnostic instruments for ASD and cognitive testing. Discriminative validity of CBCL profiles proposed for ASD screening was examined with area under the curve (AUC) scores, sensitivity, and specificity. The CBCL profiles showed low discriminative accuracy for ASD (AUC 0.59-0.70). Meeting cutoffs proposed for ASD was associated with general emotional/behavioral problems (EBP; mood problems/aggressive behavior), both in children with and without ASD. Cutoff adjustment depending on EBP-level was associated with improved discriminative accuracy for school-age children. However, the rate of false positives remained high in children with clinical levels of EBP. The results indicate that use of the CBCL profiles for ASD-specific screening would likely result in a large number of misclassifications. Although taking EBP-level into account was associated with improved discriminative accuracy for ASD, acceptable specificity could only be achieved for school-age children with below clinical levels of EBP. Further research should explore the potential of using the EBP adjustment strategy to improve the screening efficiency of other more ASD-specific instruments.","The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) has been proposed for screening of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in clinical settings.

"We tested the relative levels (i.e., age equivalencies) of concurrent cross-modality (receptive and expressive) vocabulary and the relative strength of the longitudinal, cross-modality associations between early and later vocabulary sizes in minimally verbal preschoolers with ASD. Eighty-seven children participated. Parent-reported vocabulary was assessed at four periods separated by 4 months each. Expressive age equivalent scores were higher than receptive age equivalent scores at all four periods. Cross-lagged panel analysis was used to rule out common, but trivial, explanations for differences between the longitudinal associations of interest. Key associations were tested across intervals that varied from 8 to 12 months. In two of the three tested panels, the associations between early expressive vocabulary size and later receptive vocabulary size were stronger than the associations between early receptive vocabulary size and later expressive vocabulary size, providing evidence that is consistent with the hypothesis that expressive vocabulary size drives receptive vocabulary size in minimally verbal preschoolers with ASD.","We tested the relative levels (i.e., age equivalencies) of concurrent cross-modality (receptive and expressive) vocabulary and the relative strength of the longitudinal, cross-modality associations between early and later vocabulary sizes in minimally verbal preschoolers with ASD.","Eighty-seven children participated.

"Cognitive control constrains mental operations to prioritize information that reaches conscious awareness and is essential to flexible, adaptive behavior under conditions of uncertainty. Cognitive control can be compromised by neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is characterized by the presence of social and communicative deficits, and restricted interests/repetitive behaviors. Although prior investigations have attempted to elucidate the nature of cognitive control in ASD, whether there is an underlying information processing deficit associated with cognitive control remains unclear. This study challenged cognitive control in 15 high-functioning adults with ASD and 15 typically developing (TD) controls using three novel tasks designed to systematically manipulate uncertainty. We aimed to investigate the efficiency of cognitive control in sequential information processing, cognitive control of nonsequential information processing across a range of cognitive loads and cognitive control capacity under time constraint. Results demonstrated that the ASD group performed less efficiently on sequential and nonsequential information processing, and had reduced cognitive control capacity under time constraint relative to the TD group. These findings suggest that inefficient cognitive control of information processing may be a fundamental deficit in ASD.","Cognitive control constrains mental operations to prioritize information that reaches conscious awareness and is essential to flexible, adaptive behavior under conditions of uncertainty.

"Numerous studies have observed that a proportion of infants later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience accelerated head growth during the first years of life.

"Disturbed brain and peripheral serotonin homeostasis is often found in subjects with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The role of the serotonin receptor 2A (HTR2A) in the regulation of central and peripheral serotonin homeostasis, as well as its altered expression in autistic subjects, have implicated the HTR2A gene as a major candidate for the serotonin disturbance seen in autism. Several studies, yielding so far inconclusive results, have attempted to associate autism with a functional SNP -1438 G/A (rs6311) in the HTR2A promoter region, while possible contribution of epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, to HTR2A dysregulation in autism has not yet been investigated. In this study, we compared the mean DNA methylation within the regulatory region of the HTR2A gene between autistic and control subjects. DNA methylation was analysed in peripheral blood leukocytes using bisulfite conversion and sequencing of the HTR2A region containing rs6311 polymorphism. Autistic subjects of rs6311 AG genotype displayed higher mean methylation levels within the analysed region than the corresponding controls (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05), while there was no statistically significant difference for AA and GG carriers. Our study provides preliminary evidence for increased HTR2A promoter methylation in leukocytes of a portion of adult autistic subjects, indicating that epigenetic mechanisms might contribute to HTR2A dysregulation observed in individuals with ASD.","Disturbed brain and peripheral serotonin homeostasis is often found in subjects with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

"Successful integration of signals from the various sensory systems is crucial for normal sensory-perceptual functioning, allowing for the perception of coherent objects rather than a disconnected cluster of fragmented features. Several prominent theories of autism suggest that automatic integration is impaired in this population, but there have been few empirical tests of this thesis. A standard electrophysiological metric of multisensory integration (MSI) was used to test the integrity of auditory-somatosensory integration in children with autism (N=17, aged 6-16 years), compared to age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) children. High-density electrophysiology was recorded while participants were presented with either auditory or somatosensory stimuli alone (unisensory conditions), or as a combined auditory-somatosensory stimulus (multisensory condition), in randomized order. Participants watched a silent movie during testing, ignoring concurrent stimulation. Significant differences between neural responses to the multisensory auditory-somatosensory stimulus and the unisensory stimuli (the sum of the responses to the auditory and somatosensory stimuli when presented alone) served as the dependent measure. The data revealed group differences in the integration of auditory and somatosensory information that appeared at around 175&#x2009;ms, and were characterized by the presence of MSI for the TD but not the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children. Overall, MSI was less extensive in the ASD group. These findings are discussed within the framework of current knowledge of MSI in typical development as well as in relation to theories of ASD.","Successful integration of signals from the various sensory systems is crucial for normal sensory-perceptual functioning, allowing for the perception of coherent objects rather than a disconnected cluster of fragmented features.

"The Autism Phenome Project is the largest, single site, longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous analyses from this cohort have shown that the children with autism have a total brain volume at time 1 (&#x223c;3 years of age) that is 6% larger than typically developing (TD) children. This finding is driven primarily by 15% of the boys with ASD that have disproportionate megalencephaly (ASD-DM) or brain size that is 1.5 standard deviations above what would be expected for the child's height. In the current study, cerebral cortical grey matter volume, thickness, and surface area were assayed from MRI scans of 112, 3-year-old boys with ASD and 50 age-matched TD boys. The boys with ASD-DM (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;17) were analyzed separately from the boys with normal brain size (ASD-N, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;95). Previous studies of cortical thickness and surface area for ASD children in this age range have come to diametrically different conclusions concerning the significance of cortical thickness vs. surface area. Current analyses indicate that cortical thickness was comparable across the ASD and TD groups. However, surface area was significantly greater in the ASD group compared to the TD group. This result was driven largely by the children with ASD-DM. Even in the ASD-DM group, not all cortical regions demonstrated increased surface area. These results provide strong evidence that the early cortical overgrowth associated with ASD is due primarily to increased surface area and not to increased cortical thickness.","The Autism Phenome Project is the largest, single site, longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

"Infant siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder display differences in early language and social communication skills beginning as early as the first year of life. While environmental influences on early language development are well documented in other infant populations, they have received relatively little attention inside of the infant sibling context. In this study, we analyzed home video diaries collected prospectively as part of a longitudinal study of infant siblings. Infant vowel and consonant-vowel vocalizations and maternal language-promoting and non-promoting verbal responses were scored for 30 infant siblings and 30 low risk control infants at 9 months of age. Analyses evaluated whether infant siblings or their mothers exhibited differences from low risk dyads in vocalization frequency or distribution, and whether mothers' responses were associated with other features of the high risk context. Analyses were conducted with respect to both initial risk group and preliminary outcome classification. Overall, we found no differences in infants' consonant-vowel vocalizations, the frequency of overall maternal utterances, or the distribution of mothers' response types. Both groups of infants produced more vowel than consonant-vowel vocalizations, and both groups of mothers responded to consonant-vowel vocalizations with more language-promoting than non-promoting responses. These results indicate that as a group, mothers of high risk infants provide equally high quality linguistic input to their infants in the first year of life and suggest that impoverished maternal linguistic input does not contribute to high risk infants' initial language difficulties. Implications for intervention strategies are also discussed.","Infant siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder display differences in early language and social communication skills beginning as early as the first year of life.

"Increased oxidative stress has been postulated to contribute to the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, reports of alterations in oxidation markers including glutathione (GSH), the major endogenous antioxidant, are indirect, coming from blood plasma level measurements and postmortem studies. Therefore we used in-vivo 3 Tesla proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ([1H]MRS) to directly measure GSH concentrations in the basal ganglia (BG) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex of 21 normally intelligent adult males with ASD and 29 controls who did not differ in age or IQ. There was no difference in brain GSH between patients and controls in either brain area; neither did GSH levels correlate with measures of clinical severity in patients. Thus [1H]MRS measures of cortical and subcortical GSH are not a biomarker for ASD in intellectually able adult men.","Increased oxidative stress has been postulated to contribute to the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

"Mathematics achievement in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been understudied. However, the ability to solve applied math problems is associated with academic achievement, everyday problem-solving abilities, and vocational outcomes. The paucity of research on math achievement in ASD may be partly explained by the widely-held belief that most individuals with ASD are mathematically gifted, despite emerging evidence to the contrary. The purpose of the study was twofold: to assess the relative proportions of youth with ASD who demonstrate giftedness versus disability on applied math problems, and to examine which cognitive (i.e., perceptual reasoning, verbal ability, working memory) and clinical (i.e., test anxiety) characteristics best predict achievement on applied math problems in ASD relative to typically developing peers. Twenty-seven high-functioning adolescents with ASD and 27 age- and Full Scale IQ-matched typically developing controls were assessed on standardized measures of math problem solving, perceptual reasoning, verbal ability, and test anxiety. Results indicated that 22% of the ASD sample evidenced a mathematics learning disability, while only 4% exhibited mathematical giftedness. The parsimonious linear regression model revealed that the strongest predictor of math problem solving was perceptual reasoning, followed by verbal ability and test anxiety, then diagnosis of ASD. These results inform our theories of math ability in ASD and highlight possible targets of intervention for students with ASD struggling with mathematics.","Mathematics achievement in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been understudied. However, the ability to solve applied math problems is associated with academic achievement, everyday problem-solving abilities, and vocational outcomes. The paucity of research on math achievement in ASD may be partly explained by the widely-held belief that most individuals with ASD are mathematically gifted, despite emerging evidence to the contrary. The purpose of the study was twofold: to assess the relative proportions of youth with ASD who demonstrate giftedness versus disability on applied math problems, and to examine which cognitive (i.e., perceptual reasoning, verbal ability, working memory) and clinical (i.e., test anxiety) characteristics best predict achievement on applied math problems in ASD relative to typically developing peers.","Twenty-seven high-functioning adolescents with ASD and 27 age- and Full Scale IQ-matched typically developing controls were assessed on standardized measures of math problem solving, perceptual reasoning, verbal ability, and test anxiety.","Results indicated that 22% of the ASD sample evidenced a mathematics learning disability, while only 4% exhibited mathematical giftedness.

"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a serious neurodevelopmental disorder. Several previous studies have identified preterm birth as a risk factor for ASD but none has studied whether the association between gestational age and ASD has changed over time. This is a Danish population-based follow-up study including live-born singletons born in Denmark between 1980 and 2009, identified in the Danish Medical Birth Registry, a study population of 1,775,397 children. We used a Cox regression model combined with spline to study the risk for ASD by gestational age across three decades of birth cohorts. We included 19,020 children diagnosed with ASD. Across all birth year cohorts, we found that the risk of being diagnosed with ASD increased with lower gestational age (P-value: &lt;0.01). Across all gestational weeks, we found a statistically significant higher risk estimates in birth cohort 1980 to 1989, compared to birth cohorts 1990 to 1999 and 2000 to 2009, respectively. No statistically significant difference in risk estimates was observed between birth cohort 1990 to 1999 and 2000 to 2009. The observed time trend in risk of ASD after preterm birth may reflect: (1) a change in the risk profile of persons with ASD due to the broadening of ASD diagnostic criteria over time; or (2) improved neonatal care for low GA infants, which has reduced risk of adverse outcomes like ASD in preterm children.",Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a serious neurodevelopmental disorder.

"A large proportion of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have speech and/or language difficulties. While a number of structural and functional neuroimaging methods have been used to explore the brain differences in ASD with regards to speech and language comprehension and production, the neurobiology of basic speech function in ASD has not been examined. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a neuroimaging modality with high spatial and temporal resolution that can be applied to the examination of brain dynamics underlying speech as it can capture the fast responses fundamental to this function. We acquired MEG from 21 children with high-functioning autism (mean age: 11.43 years) and 21 age- and sex-matched controls as they performed a simple oromotor task, a phoneme production task and a phonemic sequencing task. Results showed significant differences in activation magnitude and peak latencies in primary motor cortex (Brodmann Area 4), motor planning areas (BA 6), temporal sequencing and sensorimotor integration areas (BA 22/13) and executive control areas (BA 9). Our findings of significant functional brain differences between these two groups on these simple oromotor and phonemic tasks suggest that these deficits may be foundational and could underlie the language deficits seen in ASD.","A large proportion of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have speech and/or language difficulties.

"Social robotics could be a promising method for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) treatment. The aim of this article is to carry out a systematic literature review of the studies on this topic that were published in the last 10 years. We tried to address the following questions: can social robots be a useful tool in autism therapy? We followed the PRISMA guidelines, and the protocol was registered within PROSPERO database (CRD42015016158). We found many positive implications in the use of social robots in therapy as for example: ASD subjects often performed better with a robot partner rather than a human partner; sometimes, ASD patients had, toward robots, behaviors that TD patients had toward human agents; ASDs had a lot of social behaviors toward robots; during robotic sessions, ASDs showed reduced repetitive and stereotyped behaviors and, social robots manage to improve spontaneous language during therapy sessions. Therefore, robots provide therapists and researchers a means to connect with autistic subjects in an easier way, but studies in this area are still insufficient. It is necessary to clarify whether sex, intelligence quotient, and age of participants affect the outcome of therapy and whether any beneficial effects only occur during the robotic session or if they are still observable outside the clinical/experimental context.",Social robotics could be a promising method for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) treatment.

"Anxiety is one of the most concerning comorbidities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) due to its high prevalence, negative impact on physical and psychological well-being, and interaction with core deficits of ASD. Current assessment and treatment of anxiety, which rely on the observation of behavior and self-reports, are often ineffective as ASD is associated with deficits in communication and diminished introspective ability. In this light, autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity has been suggested as a marker of physiological arousal associated with anxiety. However, physiological arousal measured by ANS indices also occurs with other cognitive and emotional processes, and it is unclear whether anxiety-related arousal can be differentiated from that related to other cognitive processes. To address this gap, we investigated the use of linear and nonlinear classification techniques for differentiating anxiety-related arousal from arousal due to three cognitive processes (attention, inhibitory control, and social cognition) and physical activity based on electrocardiography signal features. Our results indicate that over 80% classification accuracy can be achieved, suggesting that ANS response can be used as a specific marker of anxiety-related arousal in a subgroup of children with ASD who demonstrate an increase in heart rate in response to anxiogenic stimuli.","Anxiety is one of the most concerning comorbidities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) due to its high prevalence, negative impact on physical and psychological well-being, and interaction with core deficits of ASD.

"Shank3 is a multi-domain, synaptic scaffolding protein that organizes proteins in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. Clinical studies suggest that &#x223c; 0.5% of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) cases may involve SHANK3 mutation/deletion. Patients with SHANK3 mutations exhibit deficits in cognition along with delayed/impaired speech/language and repetitive and obsessive/compulsive-like (OCD-like) behaviors. To examine how mutation/deletion of SHANK3 might alter brain function leading to ASD, we have independently created mice with deletion of Shank3 exons 4-9, a region implicated in ASD patients. We find that homozygous deletion of exons 4-9 (Shank3(e4-9) KO) results in loss of the two highest molecular weight isoforms of Shank3 and a significant reduction in other isoforms. Behaviorally, both Shank3(e4-9) heterozygous (HET) and Shank3(e4-9) KO mice display increased repetitive grooming, deficits in novel and spatial object recognition learning and memory, and abnormal ultrasonic vocalizations. Shank3(e4-9) KO mice also display abnormal social interaction when paired with one another. Analysis of synaptosome fractions from striata of Shank3(e4-9) KO mice reveals decreased Homer1b/c, GluA2, and GluA3 expression. Both Shank3(e4-9) HET and KO demonstrated a significant reduction in NMDA/AMPA ratio at excitatory synapses onto striatal medium spiny neurons. Furthermore, Shank3(e4-9) KO mice displayed reduced hippocampal LTP despite normal baseline synaptic transmission. Collectively these behavioral, biochemical and physiological changes suggest Shank3 isoforms have region-specific roles in regulation of AMPAR subunit localization and NMDAR function in the Shank3(e4-9) mutant mouse model of autism.","Shank3 is a multi-domain, synaptic scaffolding protein that organizes proteins in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses.

"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by social communication deficits, cognitive rigidity, and repetitive stereotyped behaviors. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have a paracrine regenerative effect, and were speculated to be a potential therapy for ASD. The BTBR inbred mouse strain is a commonly used model of ASD as it demonstrates robust behavioral deficits consistent with the diagnostic criteria for ASD. BTBR mice also exhibit decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling and reduced hippocampal neurogenesis. In the current study, we evaluated the behavioral and molecular effects of intracerebroventricular MSC transplantation in BTBR mice. Transplantation of MSC resulted in a reduction of stereotypical behaviors, a decrease in cognitive rigidity and an improvement in social behavior. Tissue analysis revealed elevated BDNF protein levels in the hippocampus accompanied by increased hippocampal neurogenesis in the MSC-transplanted mice compared with sham treated mice. This might indicate a possible mechanism underpinning the behavioral improvement. Our study suggests a novel therapeutic approach which may be translatable to ASD patients in the future.","Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by social communication deficits, cognitive rigidity, and repetitive stereotyped behaviors.

"Recent diffusion tensor imaging studies in adolescents and children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have reported a loss or an inversion of the typical left-right lateralization in fronto-temporal regions crucial for sociocommunicative skills. No studies explored atypical lateralization in toddlers and its correlation with clinical severity of ASD. We recruited a cohort of 20 subjects aged 36 months or younger receiving a first clinical diagnosis of ASD (15 males; age range 20-36 months). Patients underwent diffusion MRI (High-Angular-Resolution Diffusion Imaging protocol). Data from cortical parcellation were combined with tractography to obtain a connection matrix and diffusion indexes (DI ) including mean fractional anisotropy (DFA ), number of tracts (DNUM ), and total tract length (DTTL ). A laterality index was generated for each measure, and then correlated with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) total score. Laterality indexes of DFA were significantly correlated with ADOS-G total scores only in two intrafrontal connected areas (correlation was positive in one case and negative in the other). Laterality indexes of DTTL and DNUM showed significant negative correlations (P &lt; 0.05) in six connected areas, mainly fronto-temporal.

"In multiple conjunction search, the target is not known in advance but is defined only with respect to the distractors in a given search array, thus reducing the contributions of bottom-up and top-down attentional and perceptual processes during search. This study investigated whether the superior visual search skills typically demonstrated by individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) would be evident in multiple conjunction search. Thirty-two children with ASD and 32 age- and nonverbal IQ-matched typically developing (TD) children were administered a multiple conjunction search task. Contrary to findings from the large majority of studies on visual search in ASD, response times of individuals with ASD were significantly slower than those of their TD peers. Evidence of slowed performance in ASD suggests that the mechanisms responsible for superior ASD performance in other visual search paradigms are not available in multiple conjunction search. Although the ASD group failed to exhibit superior performance, they showed efficient search and intertrial priming levels similar to the TD group. Efficient search indicates that ASD participants were able to group distractors into distinct subsets. In summary, while demonstrating grouping and priming effects comparable to those exhibited by their TD peers, children with ASD were slowed in their performance on a multiple conjunction search task, suggesting that their usual superior performance in visual search tasks is specifically dependent on top-down and/or bottom-up attentional and perceptual processes.","In multiple conjunction search, the target is not known in advance but is defined only with respect to the distractors in a given search array, thus reducing the contributions of bottom-up and top-down attentional and perceptual processes during search.

"Behaviors associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been suggested to be considered as quantitative traits. This study investigated the structural and functional correlates of autistic traits measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) in neurotypical adolescents. Twenty-six neurotypical male adolescents (12-18 years old) were recruited for this study and underwent structural and resting functional magnetic resonance image scanning, and intelligence quotient and SRS evaluations. We used the automated surface-based method (FreeSurfer) to measure cortical thickness and seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis to derive the FC map of the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC). Brain-wise regression analyses of cortical thickness and FC maps on SRS scores were performed using a general linear model. The results indicated that higher autistic trait ratings of total SRS scores were associated with a thinner cortex in the left insula, right insula, and right superior temporal gyrus. Furthermore, we observed that only higher scores of social awareness were correlated with increased FC between the dACC and right superior temporal gyrus and decreased FC between the dACC and right putamen and thalamus. These results indicated that a quantitative trait in social cognition is associated with structural and connectivity variations linked to ASD patients.

"Autism spectrum disorder is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with strong genetic basis. To identify common genetic variations conferring the risk of ASD, we performed a two-stage genome-wide association study using ASD family and healthy control samples obtained from East Asian populations. A total of 166 ASD families (n = 500) and 642 healthy controls from the Japanese population were used as the discovery cohort. Approximately 900,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP array 6.0 chips. In the replication stage, 205 Japanese ASD cases and 184 healthy controls, as well as 418 Chinese Han trios (n = 1,254), were genotyped by TaqMan platform. Case-control analysis, family based association test, and transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) were then conducted to test the association. In the discovery stage, significant associations were suggested for 14 loci, including 5 known ASD candidate genes: GPC6, JARID2, YTHDC2, CNTN4, and CSMD1. In addition, significant associations were identified for several novel genes with intriguing functions, such as JPH3, PTPRD, CUX1, and RIT2. After a meta-analysis combining the Japanese replication samples, the strongest signal was found at rs16976358 (P = 6.04 &#xd7; 10(-7)), which is located near the RIT2 gene.

A total of 166 ASD families (n = 500) and 642 healthy controls from the Japanese population were used as the discovery cohort. Approximately 900,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP array 6.0 chips. In the replication stage, 205 Japanese ASD cases and 184 healthy controls, as well as 418 Chinese Han trios (n = 1,254), were genotyped by TaqMan platform. Case-control analysis, family based association test, and transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) were then conducted to test the association.","In the discovery stage, significant associations were suggested for 14 loci, including 5 known ASD candidate genes: GPC6, JARID2, YTHDC2, CNTN4, and CSMD1.

"In addition to defining impairments in social communication skills, individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) also show impairments in more basic sensory and motor skills. Development of new skills involves integrating information from multiple sensory modalities. This input is then used to form internal models of action that can be accessed when both performing skilled movements, as well as understanding those actions performed by others. Learning skilled gestures is particularly reliant on integration of visual and proprioceptive input. We used a modified serial reaction time task (SRTT) to decompose proprioceptive and visual components and examine whether patterns of implicit motor skill learning differ in ASD participants as compared with healthy controls. While both groups learned the implicit motor sequence during training, healthy controls showed robust generalization whereas ASD participants demonstrated little generalization when visual input was constant. In contrast, no group differences in generalization were observed when proprioceptive input was constant, with both groups showing limited degrees of generalization. The findings suggest, when learning a motor sequence, individuals with ASD tend to rely less on visual feedback than do healthy controls. Visuomotor representations are considered to underlie imitative learning and action understanding and are thereby crucial to social skill and cognitive development. Thus, anomalous patterns of implicit motor learning, with a tendency to discount visual feedback, may be an important contributor in core social communication deficits that characterize ASD.

"Subspecialty physicians who have expertise in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder typically do not have the resources to administer comprehensive diagnostic observational assessments for patients suspected of ASD. The autism mental status exam (AMSE) is a free and brief eight-item observation tool that addresses this practice gap. The AMSE, designed by Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists, Developmental Behavioral Pediatricians and Pediatric Neurologists structures the observation and documentation of signs and symptoms of ASD and yields a score. Excellent sensitivity and specificity was demonstrated in a population of high-risk adults. This protocol now investigates the AMSE's test performance in a population of 45 young children age 18 months to 5 years with suspected ASD or social and communication concerns who are evaluated at an autism research center. Each subject received a developmental evaluation, including the AMSE, performed by a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, that was followed by independent standardized assessment using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. A Best Estimate Diagnosis protocol used DSM-5 criteria to ascertain a diagnosis of ASD or non-ASD. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the AMSE cut point with the highest sensitivity and specificity. Findings indicate an optimized sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 100% for this high prevalence group. Because of its high classification accuracy in this sample of children the AMSE holds promise as a tool that can support both diagnostic decision making and standardize point of care observational assessment of ASD in high risk children.","Subspecialty physicians who have expertise in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder typically do not have the resources to administer comprehensive diagnostic observational assessments for patients suspected of ASD.

"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with unclear etiology. Reelin had been proposed to participate in the etiology of autism due to its important role in brain development. The goal of this study was to explore the association and gene-gene interactions of reelin signaling pathway related genes (RELN, VLDLR, LRP8, DAB1, FYN, and CDK5) with autism in Han Chinese population. Genotyping data of the six genes were obtained from a recent genome-wide association study performed in 430 autistic children who fulfilled the DSM-IV-TR criteria for autistic disorder, and 1,074 healthy controls. Single marker case-control association analysis and haplotype case-control association analysis were conducted after the data was screened. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) was applied to further test gene-gene interactions. Neither the single marker nor the haplotype association tests found any significant difference between the autistic group and the control group after permutation test of 1,000 rounds. The 4-locus MDR model (comprising rs6143734, rs1858782, rs634500, and rs1924267 which belong to RELN and DAB1) was determined to be the model with the highest cross-validation consistency (CVC) and testing balanced accuracy. The results indicate that an interaction between RELN and DAB1 may increase the risk of autism in the Han Chinese population. Furthermore, it can also be inferred that the involvement of RELN in the etiology of autism would occur through interaction with DAB1.","Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with unclear etiology.

"Protein N-glycosylation consists in the synthesis and processing of the oligosaccharide moiety (N-glycan) linked to a protein and it serves several functions for the proper central nervous system (CNS) development and function. Previous experimental and clinical studies have shown the importance of proper glycoprotein sialylation for the synaptic function and the occurrence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in the presence of sialylation deficiency in the CNS. Late-onset Tay Sachs disease (LOTSD) is a lysosomal disorder caused by mutations in the HEXA gene resulting in GM2-ganglioside storage in the CNS. It is characterized by progressive neurological impairment and high co-occurrence of psychiatric disturbances. We studied the N-glycome profile of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a 14 year-old patient with GM2-gangliosidosis (LOTSD). At the age of 4, the patient presented regressive autism fulfilling criteria for childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). A CSF sample was obtained in the course of diagnostic work-up for the suspicion of an underlying neurodegenerative disorder. We found definite changes of CSF N-glycans due to a dramatic decrease of sialylated biantennary and triantennary structures and an increase of asialo-core fucosylated bisected N-glycans. No changes of total plasma N-glycans were found. Herein findings highlight possible relationships between the early onset psychiatric disturbance featuring CDD in the patient and defective protein sialylation in the CNS. In conclusion, the study first shows aberrant N-glycan structures of CSF proteins in LOTSD; unveils possible pathomechanisms of GM2-gangliosidosis; supports existing relationships between neuropsychiatric disorders and unproper protein glycosylation in the CNS.",Protein N-glycosylation consists in the synthesis and processing of the oligosaccharide moiety (N-glycan) linked to a protein and it serves several functions for the proper central nervous system (CNS) development and function.

"Sleep problems are common and difficult to manage in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Another major adverse impact of sleep problems is that they exacerbate behavioral problems. To assess sleep problems and possible behavioral risk factors in detail, we aimed to compare sleep habits of children with ASD, with healthy children. The relationship between sleep difficulties and concomitant behavioral problems such as repetitive behaviors, hyperactivity, and social withdrawal were also examined. Hundred and seventeen children and adolescents including 64 with the diagnosis of ASD and 53 healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. Diagnostic Interview for ASD was performed according to DSM-IV-TR. Socio-demographical data form and childhood autism rating scale were filled by researchers. Aberrant behavior checklist (ABC), child behavior checklist and pediatric sleep questionnaire (PSQ) were completed by the parents of the children. Children with ASD had higher frequency of sleep problems, snoring, breathing problems, behavioral problems compared with healthy children (for all parameters; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).

"Social deficits are fundamental to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and a growing body of research implicates altered functioning of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), including both sympathetic and parasympathetic branches. However, few studies have explored both branches concurrently in ASD, particularly within the context of social interaction. The current study investigates patterns of change in indices of sympathetic (pre-ejection period; PEP) and parasympathetic (respiratory sinus arrhythmia; RSA) cardiac influence as boys (ages 8-11 years) with (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;18) and without (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;18) ASD engage in dyadic social interaction with novel and familiar social partners. Groups showed similar patterns of autonomic change during interaction with the novel partner, but differed in heart rate, PEP, and RSA reactivity while interacting with a familiar partner. Boys without ASD evinced decreasing sympathetic and increasing parasympathetic influence, whereas boys with ASD increased in sympathetic influence. Boys without ASD also demonstrated more consistent ANS responses across partners than those with ASD, with parasympathetic responding differentiating familiar and novel interaction partners. Finally, PEP slopes with a familiar partner correlated with boys' social skills. Implications include the importance of considering autonomic state during clinical assessment and treatment, and the potential value of regulation strategies as a complement to intervention programs aiming to support social cognition and behavior.

"Functional interregional neural coupling was measured as EEG coherence during REM sleep, a state of endogenous cortical activation, in 9 adult autistic individuals (21.1&#xb1;4.0 years) and 13 typically developed controls (21.5&#xb1;4.3 years) monitored for two consecutive nights in a sleep laboratory. Spectral analysis was performed on 60&#x2009;s of artefact-free EEG samples distributed equally throughout the first four REM sleep periods of the second night. EEG coherence was calculated for six frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, sigma, beta, and total spectrum) using a 22-electrode montage. The magnitude of coherence function was computed for intra- and interhemispheric pairs of recording sites. Results were compared by Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA). Each time the autistic group showed a greater EEG coherence than the controls; it involved intrahemispheric communication among the left visual cortex (O1) and other regions either close to or distant from the occipital cortex. In contrast, lower coherence values involved frontal electrodes in the right hemisphere. No significant differences between groups were found for interhemispheric EEG coherence. These results show that the analysis of EEG coherence during REM sleep can disclose patterns of cortical connectivity that can be reduced or increased in adults with autism compared to typically developed individuals, depending of the cortical areas studied. Superior coherence involving visual perceptual areas in autism is consistent with an enhanced role of perception in autistic brain organization.","Functional interregional neural coupling was measured as EEG coherence during REM sleep, a state of endogenous cortical activation, in 9 adult autistic individuals (21.1&#xb1;4.0 years) and 13 typically developed controls (21.5&#xb1;4.3 years) monitored for two consecutive nights in a sleep laboratory.","Spectral analysis was performed on 60&#x2009;s of artefact-free EEG samples distributed equally throughout the first four REM sleep periods of the second night.

"Very preterm (VP) survivors are at increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared with term-born children. This study explored whether neonatal magnetic resonance (MR) brain features differed in VP children with and without ASD at 7 years. One hundred and seventy-two VP children (&lt;30 weeks' gestation or &lt;1250 g birth weight) underwent structural brain MR scans at term equivalent age (TEA; 40 weeks' gestation &#xb1;2 weeks) and were assessed for ASD at 7 years of age. The presence and severity of white matter, cortical gray matter, deep nuclear gray matter, and cerebellar abnormalities were assessed, and total and regional brain volumes were measured. ASD was diagnosed using a standardized parent report diagnostic interview and confirmed via an independent assessment. Eight VP children (4.7%) were diagnosed with ASD. Children with ASD had more cystic lesions in the cortical white matter at TEA compared with those without ASD (odds ratio [OR] 8.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5, 51.3, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02).

"Although tactile reactivity issues are commonly reported in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Less feed-forward inhibition has been proposed as a potential mechanism for some symptoms of ASD. We tested static and dynamic tactile thresholds as a behavioral proxy of feed-forward inhibition in 42 children (21 children with ASD and 21 typically developing [TD] children). Subthreshold conditioning typically raises the dynamic detection threshold, thus comparison of the dynamic to the static threshold generates a metric that predicts gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediated feed-forward inhibition. Children with ASD had marginally higher static thresholds and a significantly lower ratio between thresholds as compared with TD children. The lower ratio, only seen in children with ASD, might be indicative of less inhibition. Static thresholds were correlated with autism spectrum quotient scores, indicating the higher the tactile threshold, the more ASD traits. The amount of feed-forward inhibition (ratio between dynamic/static) was negatively correlated with autism diagnostic observation schedule repetitive behavior scores, meaning the less inhibition the more ASD symptoms. In summary, children with ASD showed altered tactile processing compared with TD children; thus measuring static and dynamic thresholds could be a potential biomarker for ASD and might be useful for prediction of treatment response with therapeutics, including those that target the GABAergic system.

"Dysfunction of the serotoninergic and glutamatergic systems is implicated in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) together with various neuroinflammatory mediators. As the kynurenine pathway (KP) of tryptophan degradation is activated in neuroinflammatory states, we hypothesized that there may be a link between inflammation in ASD and enhanced KP activation resulting in reduced serotonin synthesis from tryptophan and production of KP metabolites capable of modulating glutamatergic activity. A cross-sectional study of 15 different Omani families with newly diagnosed children with ASD (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15) and their age-matched healthy siblings (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;12) was designed. Immunological profile and the KP metabolic signature were characterized in the study participants. Our data indicated that there were alterations to the KP in ASD. Specifically, increased production of the downstream metabolite, quinolinic acid, which is capable of enhancing glutamatergic neurotransmission was noted. Correlation studies also demonstrated that the presence of inflammation induced KP activation in ASD. Until now, previous studies have failed to establish a link between inflammation, glutamatergic activity, and the KP. Our findings also suggest that increased quinolinic acid may be linked to 16p11.2 mutations leading to abnormal glutamatergic activity associated with ASD pathogenesis and may help rationalize the efficacy of sulforaphane treatment in ASD.

"A growing area of interest and relevance in the study of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) focuses on the relationship between multisensory temporal function and the behavioral, perceptual, and cognitive impairments observed in ASD. Atypical sensory processing is becoming increasingly recognized as a core component of autism, with evidence of atypical processing across a number of sensory modalities. These deviations from typical processing underscore the value of interpreting ASD within a multisensory framework. Furthermore, converging evidence illustrates that these differences in audiovisual processing may be specifically related to temporal processing. This review seeks to bridge the connection between temporal processing and audiovisual perception, and to elaborate on emerging data showing differences in audiovisual temporal function in autism. We also discuss the consequence of such changes, the specific impact on the processing of different classes of audiovisual stimuli (e.g. speech vs. nonspeech, etc.), and the presumptive brain processes and networks underlying audiovisual temporal integration. Finally, possible downstream behavioral implications, and possible remediation strategies are outlined.

"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a behaviorally defined complex neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by impairments in social communication, by the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors, interests and activities, and by abnormalities in sensory reactivity. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a promising, emerging tool for the study and potential treatment of ASD. Recent studies suggest that TMS measures provide rapid and noninvasive pathophysiological ASD biomarkers. Furthermore, repetitive TMS (rTMS) may represent a novel treatment strategy for reducing some of the core and associated ASD symptoms. However, the available literature on the TMS use in ASD is preliminary, composed of studies with methodological limitations. Thus, off-label clinical rTMS use for therapeutic interventions in ASD without an investigational device exemption and outside of an IRB approved research trial is premature pending further, adequately powered and controlled trials. Leaders in this field have gathered annually for a two-day conference (prior to the 2014 and 2015 International Meeting for Autism Research, IMFAR) to share recent progress, promote collaboration across laboratories, and establish consensus on protocols. Here we review the literature in the use of TMS in ASD in the context of the unique challenges required for the study and exploration of treatment strategies in this population. We also suggest future directions for this field of investigations. While its true potential in ASD has yet to be delineated, TMS represents an innovative research tool and a novel, possibly transformative approach to the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders.","Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a behaviorally defined complex neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by impairments in social communication, by the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors, interests and activities, and by abnormalities in sensory reactivity.

"The true extent of school bullying among youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) remains an underexplored area. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to: (a) assess the proportion of school-aged youth with ASD involved in school bullying as perpetrators, victims or both; (b) examine whether the observed prevalence estimates vary when different sources of heterogeneity related to the participants' characteristics and to the assessment methods are considered; and (c) compare the risk of school bullying between youth with ASD and their typically developing (TD) peers. A systematic literature search was performed and 17 studies met the inclusion criteria. The resulting pooled prevalence estimate for general school bullying perpetration, victimization and both was 10%, 44%, and 16%, respectively. Pooled prevalence was also estimated for physical, verbal, and relational school victimization and was 33%, 50%, and 31%, respectively.

"Alexithymia refers to pronounced difficulty in identifying and describing one's own emotions and is associated with an externally oriented focus of thinking. Alexithymia is known to be much more common in adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) compared with the typically developing (TD) adult population. However, we know very little about alexithymia in young children with ASD and advancing our understanding of this topic may be of critical clinical and translational importance. Here, we present the first study to examine alexithymia in children with ASD. We find that alexithymia is substantially elevated in ASD on both self- and parent-report measures. Despite both measures being sensitive to on-average group differentiation, we find no evidence of correlation between such measures, indicating that children and their parents may be using different sources of information. Parent-rated alexithymia is also associated with increasing levels of autistic traits. Discrepancy between self and other alexithymia ratings are also associated with autistic traits, but only in ASD. These results underscore the idea that assessing alexithymia in ASD at younger ages may help identify important subgroups that have particular difficulties in the domain of emotion processing.

"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in three core areas--language, social interaction and restricted/repetitive behaviours. It is generally accepted that genetics plays a large role in the aetiology of autism, but the exact mechanism is still unknown. We recently published evidence of an association between autism and the ITGA4 gene [Conroy et al., 2008]. Two genomic regions have shown evidence of linkage to autism in multiple studies--2q31-q33 and 17q21-q22. Both of these regions harbour multiple integrin subunit genes. We tested markers in ITGA3, ITGA6, ITGAV and ITGB3 for association with autism in the Irish autism sample. No markers in ITGA3, ITGA6, ITGAV and ITGB3 were found to be associated with autism. Three 3-marker haplotypes in ITGAV, ITGA3 and ITGA6 were found to be nominally associated (0.01 &lt; P &lt; 0.05) and to have unremarkable findings. Our data indicates that in the Irish autism sample the integrin genes tested here do not play an important role in the aetiology of autism.","Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in three core areas--language, social interaction and restricted/repetitive behaviours.

"The uremic toxin p-cresol (4-methylphenol) is either of environmental origin or can be synthetized from tyrosine by cresol-producing bacteria present in the gut lumen. Elevated p-cresol amounts have been previously found in the urines of Italian and French autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children up until 8 years of age, and may be associated with autism severity or with the intensity of abnormal behaviors. This study aims to investigate the mechanism producing elevated urinary p-cresol in ASD. Urinary p-cresol levels were thus measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography in a sample of 53 Italian ASD children assessed for (a) presence of Clostridium spp. strains in the gut by means of an in vitro fecal stool test and of Clostridium difficile-derived toxin A/B in the feces, (b) intestinal permeability using the lactulose/mannitol (LA/MA) test, (c) frequent use of antibiotics due to recurrent infections during the first 2 years of postnatal life, and (d) stool habits with the Bristol Stool Form Scale. Chronic constipation was the only variable significantly associated with total urinary p-cresol concentration (P &lt; 0.05).

"Joint attention (JA) and spontaneous facial mimicry (SFM) are fundamental processes in social interactions, and they are closely related to empathic abilities. When tested independently, both of these processes have been usually observed to be atypical in individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC). However, it is not known how these processes interact with each other in relation to autistic traits. This study addresses this question by testing the impact of JA on SFM of happy faces using a truly interactive paradigm. Sixty-two neurotypical participants engaged in gaze-based social interaction with an anthropomorphic, gaze-contingent virtual agent. The agent either established JA by initiating eye contact or looked away, before looking at an object and expressing happiness or disgust. Eye tracking was used to make the agent's gaze behavior and facial actions contingent to the participants' gaze. SFM of happy expressions was measured by Electromyography (EMG) recording over the Zygomaticus Major muscle. Results showed that JA augments SFM in individuals with low compared with high autistic traits. These findings are in line with reports of reduced impact of JA on action imitation in individuals with ASC. Moreover, they suggest that investigating atypical interactions between empathic processes, instead of testing these processes individually, might be crucial to understanding the nature of social deficits in autism.

"Atypical pragmatic language is often present in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), along with delays or deficits in structural language. This study investigated the use of the ""fillers"" uh and um by children ages 4-8 during the autism diagnostic observation schedule. Fillers reflect speakers' difficulties with planning and delivering speech, but they also serve communicative purposes, such as negotiating control of the floor or conveying uncertainty. We hypothesized that children with ASD would use different patterns of fillers compared to peers with typical development or with specific language impairment (SLI), reflecting differences in social ability and communicative intent. Regression analyses revealed that children in the ASD group were much less likely to use um than children in the other two groups. Filler use is an easy-to-quantify feature of behavior that, in concert with other observations, may help to distinguish ASD from SLI.

"Adults with High Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) viewed scenes with people in them, while having their eye movements recorded. The task was to indicate, using a button press, whether the pictures were normal, or in some way weird or odd. Oddities in the pictures were categorized as violations of either perceptual or social norms. Compared to a Typically Developed (TD) control group, the ASD participants were equally able to categorize the scenes as odd or normal, but they took longer to respond. The eye movement patterns showed that the ASD group made more fixations and revisits to the target areas in the odd scenes compared with the TD group. Additionally, when the ASD group first fixated the target areas in the scenes, they failed to initially detect the social oddities. These two findings have clear implications for processing difficulties in ASD for the social domain, where it is important to detect social cues on-line, and where there is little opportunity to go back and recheck possible cues in fast dynamic interactions.

"Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may describe other individuals differently compared with typical adults. In this study, we first asked participants to describe closely related individuals such as parents and close friends with 10 positive and 10 negative characteristics. We then used standard natural language processing methods to digitize and visualize these descriptions. The complex patterns of these descriptive sentences exhibited a difference in semantic space between individuals with ASD and control participants. Machine learning algorithms were able to automatically detect and discriminate between these two groups. Furthermore, we showed that these descriptive sentences from adults with ASD exhibited fewer connections as defined by word-word co-occurrences in descriptions, and these connections in words formed a less ""small-world"" like network.

"An atypical pattern of facial expression processing in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been discussed in previous studies. In this study, we systematically examined the hypothesis of selective abnormality of gaze pattern of in children with ASD using three emotion judgment ""bubble"" tasks. In this study, we used a data-driven driven technique, referred to as ""Bubbles"" to examine the hypothesis that ASD children will not show a general but rather a selective abnormality in extracting eyes information expressed by different emotions. Results indicated that similar to non-ASD individuals, ASD individuals used information from other people's eyes to judge happiness and anger. In contrast, ASD individuals showed a remarkable reduction in processing the eye region in fearful face, together with enhanced processing of the mouth, compared with the control group. The results suggest that a selective abnormality in extracting eyes information of fearful face without abnormality in processing eyes area of other basic facial emotions is a key and characteristic feature of autistic facial cognition. To our knowledge, this finding regarding the selective abnormality in extracting fearful information from another's eyes in ASDs has never been reported in previous studies and the information gathered as a part of this pilot research project has important clinical implications for social information processing training.

"Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are diagnosed, on average, around the age of 4 years. However, previous research has shown that the diagnosis can be made as early as 2 years, and that if the child is seen a year or more later, it is highly likely that the diagnosis will be confirmed. In this study, to examine whether diagnoses made as early as 18 months of age are also ""stable,"" we followed a group of younger siblings of children with ASD (who are known to be at higher risk).

"Past studies have suggested that conditions experienced by women during pregnancy (e.g. obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)) may be associated with having a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our objective was to compare mothers who had a child diagnosed with ASD to mothers of children with a non-ASD developmental disorder (DD) or without any reported DD (controls). To accomplish the objective we collected medical record data from patients who resided in the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center's (CCHMC) primary catchment area and linked those data to data from birth certificates (to identify risk factors). Two comparison groups were analyzed; one with DD; and the other, controls without a reported ASD or DD. Descriptive statistics and regression analyses evaluated differences. Differences were greater comparing mothers of ASD to controls than comparing ASD to DD. Maternal obesity and GDM were associated with a statistically significant approximately 1.5-fold increased odds of having a child with an ASD.

"Conversational or ""co-speech"" gestures play an important role in communication, facilitating turntaking, providing visuospatial information, clarifying subtleties of emphasis, and other pragmatic cues. Consistent with other pragmatic language deficits, individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are said to produce fewer conversational gestures, as specified in many diagnostic measures. Surprisingly, while research shows fewer deictic gestures in young children with ASD, there is a little empirical evidence addressing other forms of gesture. The discrepancy between clinical and empirical observations may reflect impairments unrelated to frequency, such as gesture quality or integration with speech. Adolescents with high-functioning ASD (n = 15), matched on age, gender, and IQ to 15 typically developing (TD) adolescents, completed a narrative task to assess the spontaneous production of speech and gesture. Na&#xef;ve observers rated the stories for communicative quality. Overall, the ASD group's stories were rated as less clear and engaging. Although utterance and gesture rates were comparable, the ASD group's gestures were less closely synchronized with the co-occurring speech, relative to control participants. This gesture-speech synchrony specifically impacted communicative quality across participants. Furthermore, while story ratings were associated with gesture count in TD adolescents, no such relationship was observed in adolescents with ASD, suggesting that gestures do not amplify communication in this population. Quality ratings were, however, correlated with ASD symptom severity scores, such that participants with fewer ASD symptoms were rated as telling higher quality stories. Implications of these findings are discussed in terms of communication and neuropsychological functioning in ASD.","Conversational or ""co-speech"" gestures play an important role in communication, facilitating turntaking, providing visuospatial information, clarifying subtleties of emphasis, and other pragmatic cues.

"Given the ecological importance of biological motion and its relevance to social cognition, considerable effort has been devoted over the past decade to studying biological motion perception in autism. However, previous studies have asked observers to detect or recognize briefly presented human actions placed in isolation, without spatial or temporal context. Research on typical populations has shown the influence of temporal context in biological motion perception: prolonged exposure to one action gives rise to an aftereffect that biases perception of a subsequently displayed action. Whether people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show such adaptation effects for biological motion stimuli remains unknown. To address this question, this study examined how well youth with ASD recognize ambiguous actions and adapt to recently-observed actions. Compared to typically-developing (TD) controls, youth with ASD showed no differences in perceptual boundaries between actions categories, indicating intact ability in recognizing actions. However, children with ASD showed weakened adaptation to biological motion. It is unlikely that the reduced action adaptability in autism was due to delayed developmental trajectory, as older children with ASD showed weaker adaptation to actions than younger children with ASD. Our results further suggest that high-level (i.e., action) processing weakens with age for children with ASD, but this change may be accompanied by a potentially compensatory mechanism based on more involvement of low-level (i.e., motion) processing.

"Rodents exposed prenatally to valproic acid (VPA) show autism-related behavioral abnormalities. We recently found that prenatal VPA exposure causes a reduction of dopaminergic activity in the prefrontal cortex of male, but not female, mice. This suggests that reduced prefrontal dopaminergic activity is associated with behavioral abnormalities in VPA-treated mice. In the present study, we examined whether the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder drugs methylphenidate and atomoxetine (which increase dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex, but not striatum, in mice) could alleviate the behavioral abnormalities and changes in dendritic spine morphology induced by prenatal VPA exposure. We found that methylphenidate and atomoxetine increased prefrontal dopamine and noradrenaline release in VPA-treated mice. Acute treatment with methylphenidate or atomoxetine did not alleviate the social interaction deficits or recognition memory impairment in VPA-treated mice, while chronic treatment for 2 weeks did. Methylphenidate or atomoxetine for 2 weeks also improved the prenatal VPA-induced decrease in dendritic spine density in the prefrontal cortex. The effects of these drugs on behaviors and dendritic spine morphology were antagonized by concomitant treatment with the dopamine-D1 receptor antagonist SCH39166 or the dopamine-D2 receptor antagonist raclopride, but not by the &#x3b1;2 -adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan. These findings suggest that chronic treatment with methylphenidate or atomoxetine improves abnormal behaviors and diminishes the reduction in spine density in VPA-treated mice via a prefrontal dopaminergic system-dependent mechanism.

"Previous studies indicate that prenatal exposure to infections is a possible pathway through which autism spectrum disorders (ASD) could be initiated. We investigated whether immunoglobulin levels in archived specimens obtained from newborns subsequently diagnosed with ASD are different from levels in newborn specimens from controls. Children with ASD born in six California counties in 1994 were ascertained through records of the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) and Kaiser Permanente; controls were randomly selected using birth certificates. Archived newborn blood specimens were obtained from the California Genetic Disease Screening Program (GDSP) for N = 213 cases and N = 265 controls and assayed to determine levels of total IgG, antigen-specific IgG to selected common pathogens, total IgM, total IgA, and C-reactive protein (CRP). We did not find measurable levels of total IgM or IgA in any neonate and measurable CRP was present in only a few. No antigen-specific IgG antibodies were elevated in cases compared to controls and total IgG levels were lower. In adjusted models, a 10-unit increase in total IgG yielded an OR = 0.72 (95% CI 0.56, 0.91); a significantly decreasing trend in risk of ASD was observed across increasing exposure quartiles of total IgG (P = 0.01). The finding of lower IgG in cases may indicate maternal immune dysfunction during gestation and/or impaired transplacental transfer of immunoglobulins. Further investigation of IgG levels in newborns and the mechanisms by which they might be associated with ASD are warranted.",Previous studies indicate that prenatal exposure to infections is a possible pathway through which autism spectrum disorders (ASD) could be initiated.,"We investigated whether immunoglobulin levels in archived specimens obtained from newborns subsequently diagnosed with ASD are different from levels in newborn specimens from controls.

"Many children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience high levels of anxiety. A widely used measure for typically developing children is the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS). However, such anxiety measures may require adaptation to accommodate characteristics of those with ASD.

Content validity was refined during focus groups with parents. Polychoric factor analysis was undertaken on data from 170 children with ASD, aged 8-16, and their parents. This process resulted in the creation of a new 24 item scale (self and parent report) each with four subscales: Performance Anxiety, Uncertainty, Anxious Arousal, and Separation Anxiety, with evidence of good reliability and validity.

"Many studies have reported poor motor performance in autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, the underlying brain mechanisms remain unclear. Recent neuroimaging studies have suggested that abnormalities of the white matter (WM) are related to the features of ASD. In this study, we used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to investigate which WM regions correlate with motor performance in children with ASD, and whether the WM volume in those brain regions differed between children with ASD and typically developing (TD) children. The subjects included 19 children with ASD and 20 TD controls. Motor performance was assessed using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children 2 (M-ABC 2). Children with ASD showed poorer motor performance than did the controls. There was a significant positive correlation between the total test score on the M-ABC 2 and the volume of WM in the brainstem and WM adjacent to the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG). In addition, compared with the TD controls, children with ASD had a decreased volume of WM in the brainstem and adjacent to the left intraparietal sulcus, which is close to the SMG. These findings suggest that structural changes in the WM in the brainstem and left inferior parietal lobule may contribute to poor motor performance in children with ASD.

"Executive function and play skills develop in early childhood and are linked to cognitive and language ability.

"Individuals with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show difficulties identifying familiar faces, recognizing emotional expressions and judging eye-gaze direction. Recent research suggests that relatives of individuals with AS also show impairments in some aspects of face processing but no study has comprehensively assessed the nature and extent of face-processing difficulties in a group of relatives. This study compared the performance of 22 parents/adult siblings of individuals with ASD (""relatives"" group), 26 adults with ASD, and 26 typically developing adults on tasks of face discrimination, facial expression recognition and judging eye-gaze direction. Relatives of individuals with ASD were less able to discriminate subtle differences between faces than typically developing adults, but were more sensitive to such differences than adults with ASD. Furthermore, relatives were significantly worse at identifying expressions of fear and disgust than typically developing adults and failed to show the typical sensitivity to direct compared with averted eye-gaze direction--a strikingly similar pattern to that observed in adults with ASD. These findings show that atypical patterns of face processing are found in some relatives of individuals with ASD and suggest that these difficulties may represent a cognitive endophenotype.","Individuals with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show difficulties identifying familiar faces, recognizing emotional expressions and judging eye-gaze direction.

Participants had to indicate whether pairs of Chinese characters presented visually were related in meaning. Group (ASD, TD) &#xd7; Age (Old, Young) ANOVA was used to examine the difference of age-related changes. Direct comparisons between the adolescent group and the child group were also performed. The behavioral results showed that the ASD group had lower accuracy in the related condition relative to the TD group. The neuroimaging results showed greater activation in the cuneus and less activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus in boys with ASD than TD boys. Children with ASD produced greater activation in the cuneus than TD children. Adolescents with ASD showed reduced left IFG activation as compared to TD adolescents. Our findings suggest that TD boys may engage more in higher-level processing of retrieving or selecting semantic features while boys with ASD may rely more on lower-level visual processing during semantic judgments.

Group (ASD, TD) × Age (Old, Young) ANOVA was used to examine the difference of age-related changes. Direct comparisons between the adolescent group and the child group were also performed.",The behavioral results showed that the ASD group had lower accuracy in the related condition relative to the TD group. The neuroimaging results showed greater activation in the cuneus and less activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus in boys with ASD than TD boys. Children with ASD produced greater activation in the cuneus than TD children. Adolescents with ASD showed reduced left IFG activation as compared to TD adolescents. Our findings suggest that TD boys may engage more in higher-level processing of retrieving or selecting semantic features while boys with ASD may rely more on lower-level visual processing during semantic judgments. The findings imply different functional organizations of the semantic system between the two groups.,1,1,1,The behavioral results showed that the ASD group had lower accuracy in the related condition relative to the TD group.

"This study investigated for the first time the broad autism phenotype (BAP) in the context of older adulthood and its associations with real-world executive function, social support, and both depression and anxiety symptomatology. Based on self-ratings of autistic traits, 66 older adults (60+ years old, range&#x2009;=&#x2009;61-88) were split into BAP (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20) and control (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;46) groups. Individuals in the BAP group, even after controlling for age, education level, sex, and health problems, exhibited more real-world executive function problems in multiple domains, reported lower levels of social support, and self-rated increased depression and anxiety symptomatology compared to the control group. Regression analysis revealed that level of social support was the strongest predictor of BAP traits across both groups, although real-world executive function problems and depression symptomatology were also significant predictors. Moreover, when predicting anxiety and depression symptomatology, BAP traits were the strongest predictors above and beyond the effects of demographic factors, real-world executive function problems, and social support levels. These findings suggest that the BAP in older adulthood imparts additional risks to areas of functioning that are known to be crucial to aging-related outcomes in the context of typical development. These results might in turn inform aging in autism spectrum disorder, which has been largely unexplored to date.

"Younger siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; high-risk siblings) exhibit lower levels of initiating joint attention (IJA; sharing an object or experience with a social partner through gaze and/or gesture) than low-risk siblings of children without ASD. However, high-risk siblings also exhibit substantial variability in this domain. The neurotransmitter dopamine is linked to brain areas associated with reward, motivation, and attention, and common dopaminergic variants have been associated with attention difficulties. We examined whether these common dopaminergic variants, DRD4 and DRD2, explain variability in IJA in high-risk (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;55) and low-risk (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;38) siblings. IJA was assessed in the first year during a semi-structured interaction with an examiner. DRD4 and DRD2 genotypes were coded according to associated dopaminergic functioning to create a gene score, with higher scores indicating more genotypes associated with less efficient dopaminergic functioning. Higher dopamine gene scores (indicative of less efficient dopaminergic functioning) were associated with lower levels of IJA in the first year for high-risk siblings, while the opposite pattern emerged in low-risk siblings. Findings suggest differential susceptibility-IJA was differentially associated with dopaminergic functioning depending on familial ASD risk. Understanding genes linked to ASD-relevant behaviors in high-risk siblings will aid in early identification of children at greatest risk for difficulties in these behavioral domains, facilitating targeted prevention and intervention.

"Sensory features are prevalent and heterogeneous across children with ASD and these features have been associated with child outcomes. Identification of clinically defined sensory subtypes may enhance our understanding of unique phenotypes that have implications for etiology, prognosis, and intervention. This longitudinal study used a national online survey aimed to identify associations of previously validated sensory subtypes to specific child and family characteristics and functional outcomes [vineland adaptive behavior scale-II (VABS) and parenting stress index short form (PSI)]. The sensory experiences questionnaire-3.0 was collected from caregivers with children with ASD, ages 2-12, at two time points (Time 1, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1307, Time 2, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;884), 1 year apart. Functional outcomes assessments were collected at the second time point. A latent profile transition analysis (LPTA) was used to test associations, and results indicated that the attenuated-preoccupied subtype presented with the significantly lowest levels of VABS adaptive behavior composite scores compared to the other three sensory subtypes. Both the VABS maladaptive behavior index and the total PSI score were significantly highest in the extreme-mixed subtype. These results underscore the clinical utility of this subtyping approach for differentiating characteristics and functional outcomes associated with clinically defined sensory phenotypes. These findings may have implications for better understanding etiology, prognosis, and more precise targets for interventions designed to ameliorate sensory difficulties, and ultimately mitigate negative developmental consequences and parenting stress.

"Behavioral therapies are currently the most effective interventions for treating the diagnostic symptoms of autism. We employed a mouse model of autism to evaluate components of behavioral interventions that improve sociability in mice. BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR) is an inbred mouse strain that exhibits prominent behavioral phenotypes with face validity to all three diagnostic symptom categories of autism, including robust and well-replicated deficits in social approach and reciprocal social interactions. To investigate the role of peer interactions in the development of sociability, BTBR juvenile mice were reared in the same home cage with juvenile mice of a highly social inbred strain, C57BL/6J (B6). Subject mice were tested as young adults for sociability and repetitive behaviors. B6 controls reared with B6 showed their strain-typical high sociability. BTBR controls reared with BTBR showed their strain-typical lack of sociability. In contrast, BTBR reared with B6 as juveniles showed significant sociability as young adults. A 20-day intervention was as effective as a 40-day intervention for improving social approach behavior. High levels of repetitive self-grooming in BTBR were not rescued by peer-rearing with B6, indicating specificity of the intervention to the social domain. These results from a robust mouse model of autism support the interpretation that social enrichment with juvenile peers is a beneficial intervention for improving adult outcome in the social domain. This novel paradigm may prove useful for discovering factors that are essential for effective behavioral treatments, and biological mechanisms underlying effective behavioral interventions.","Behavioral therapies are currently the most effective interventions for treating the diagnostic symptoms of autism.

"Changes in sensory and multisensory function are increasingly recognized as a common phenotypic characteristic of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Furthermore, much recent evidence suggests that sensory disturbances likely play an important role in contributing to social communication weaknesses-one of the core diagnostic features of ASD. An established sensory disturbance observed in ASD is reduced audiovisual temporal acuity. In the current study, we substantially extend these explorations of multisensory temporal function within the framework that an inability to rapidly recalibrate to changes in audiovisual temporal relations may play an important and under-recognized role in ASD. In the paradigm, we present ASD and typically developing (TD) children and adolescents with asynchronous audiovisual stimuli of varying levels of complexity and ask them to perform a simultaneity judgment (SJ). In the critical analysis, we test audiovisual temporal processing on trial t as a condition of trial t&#x2009;-&#x2009;1. The results demonstrate that individuals with ASD fail to rapidly recalibrate to audiovisual asynchronies in an equivalent manner to their TD counterparts for simple and non-linguistic stimuli (i.e., flashes and beeps, hand-held tools), but exhibit comparable rapid recalibration for speech stimuli. These results are discussed in terms of prior work showing a speech-specific deficit in audiovisual temporal function in ASD, and in light of current theories of autism focusing on sensory noise and stability of perceptual representations.

"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are pervasive developmental disorders characterized by impairments in language development and social interaction, along with restricted and stereotyped behaviors. These behaviors often include atypical responses to sensory stimuli; some children with ASD are easily overwhelmed by sensory stimuli, while others may seem unaware of their environment. Vision and audition are two sensory modalities important for social interactions and language, and are differentially affected in ASD. In the present study, 16 children and adolescents with ASD and 16 typically developing (TD) participants matched for age, gender, nonverbal IQ, and handedness were tested using a mixed event-related/blocked functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm to examine basic perceptual processes that may form the foundation for later-developing cognitive abilities. Auditory (high or low pitch) and visual conditions (dot located high or low in the display) were presented, and participants indicated whether the stimuli were ""high"" or ""low."" Results for the auditory condition showed downregulated activity of the visual cortex in the TD group, but upregulation in the ASD group. This atypical activity in visual cortex was associated with autism symptomatology. These findings suggest atypical crossmodal (auditory-visual) modulation linked to sociocommunicative deficits in ASD, in agreement with the general hypothesis of low-level sensorimotor impairments affecting core symptomatology.

"Although autism presents a unique perceptual phenotype defined in part by atypical (often enhanced) analysis of spatial information, few biologically plausible hypotheses have been advanced to explain its neural underpinnings. One plausible explanation is functional but altered lateral connectivity mediating early or local mechanisms selectively responsive to different stimulus attributes, including spatial frequency and contrast. The goal of the present study was first to assess far visual acuity in autism using Landolt-C optotypes defined by different local stimulus attributes. Second, we investigated whether acuity is differentially affected in autism when target optotypes are simultaneously presented with flanking stimuli at different distances. This typical detrimental ""crowding effect"" of flanking stimuli on target optotype discrimination is attributed to lateral inhibitory interaction of neurons encoding for visual properties of distracters close to the target. Results failed to demonstrate a between-group difference in acuity to Landolt-C optotypes, whether defined by luminance- or texture-contrast. However, the expected crowding effect at one gap-size opening distance was evidenced for the control group only; a small effect was observed for the autism group at two gap-size opening. These results suggest that although far visual acuity is unremarkable in autism, altered local lateral connectivity within early perceptual areas underlying spatial information processing in autism is atypical. Altered local lateral connectivity in autism might originate from an imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory neural signaling, resulting in changes regarding elementary feature extraction and subsequent downstream visual integration and visuo-spatial analysis. This notion is discussed within the context of characteristic lower- and higher-level perceptual processing in autism.","Although autism presents a unique perceptual phenotype defined in part by atypical (often enhanced) analysis of spatial information, few biologically plausible hypotheses have been advanced to explain its neural underpinnings.

This typical detrimental ""crowding effect"" of flanking stimuli on target optotype discrimination is attributed to lateral inhibitory interaction of neurons encoding for visual properties of distracters close to the target.","Results failed to demonstrate a between-group difference in acuity to Landolt-C optotypes, whether defined by luminance- or texture-contrast. However, the expected crowding effect at one gap-size opening distance was evidenced for the control group only; a small effect was observed for the autism group at two gap-size opening. These results suggest that although far visual acuity is unremarkable in autism, altered local lateral connectivity within early perceptual areas underlying spatial information processing in autism is atypical. Altered local lateral connectivity in autism might originate from an imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory neural signaling, resulting in changes regarding elementary feature extraction and subsequent downstream visual integration and visuo-spatial analysis. This notion is discussed within the context of characteristic lower- and higher-level perceptual processing in autism.",1,1,1,"Results failed to demonstrate a between-group difference in acuity to Landolt-C optotypes, whether defined by luminance- or texture-contrast.

"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as a synaptopathy is revealed to be pertained to aberrant glutamatergic neurotransmission. Glutamate receptor, metabotropic 7 (GRM7), a receptor coding gene of this pathway, is a new candidate gene for autism. The aim of this study was to examine if there is a relationship between genetic variants rs779867 and rs6782011 of GRM7 with ASD. The present research was designed as a population-based, case-control study including 518 ASD patients versus 472 control individuals. The results showed that the frequency of rs779867 G/G genotype was significantly higher in ASD patients compared to healthy controls (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0001). Also, the G allele of this SNP was found to be significantly more frequent in the patients than control group (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0001). Haplotype analysis exhibited significant association of two estimated block of rs6782011/rs779867 in ASD patients versus control group.

"Germline heterozygous mutations in Pten (phosphatase and tensin homolog) are associated with macrocephaly and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Pten germline heterozygous (Pten<sup>+/-</sup> ) mice approximate these mutations, and both sexes show widespread brain overgrowth and impaired social behavior. Strikingly similar behavior phenotypes have been reported in oxytocin (Oxt) and/or oxytocin receptor (OxtR) knockout mice. Thus, we hypothesized that the behavioral phenotypes of germline Pten<sup>+/-</sup> mice may be caused by reduced Pten function in Oxt-expressing cells. To investigate this, we tested mice in which Pten was conditionally deleted using oxytocin-Cre (Oxt-Cre<sup>+</sup> ; Pten<sup>loxP/+</sup> , Oxt-Cre<sup>+</sup> ; Pten<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> ) on a battery including assays of social, repetitive, depression-like, and anxiety-like behaviors.

"Sensorimotor processing alterations are a growing focus in the assessment and treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The rotational vestibulo-ocular reflex (rVOR), which functions to maintain stable vision during head movements, is a sensorimotor system that may be useful in understanding such alterations and their underlying neurobiology. In this study, we assessed post-rotary nystagmus elicited by continuous whole body rotation among children with high-functioning ASD and typically developing children. Children with ASD exhibited increased rVOR gain, the ratio of eye velocity to head velocity, indicating a possible lack of cerebellar inhibitory input to brainstem vestibular nuclei in this population. The ASD group also showed less regular or periodic horizontal eye movements as indexed by greater variance accounted for by multiple higher frequency bandwidths as well as greater entropy scores compared to typically developing children. The decreased regularity or dysrhythmia in the temporal structure of nystagmus beats in children with ASD may be due to alterations in cerebellum and brainstem circuitry. These findings could potentially serve as a model to better understand the functional effects of differences in these brain structures in ASD.

"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a commensal bacterium present in the lower genital tract of 15-30% of healthy pregnant women. GBS is the leading cause of chorioamnionitis and cerebral injuries in newborns, occurring most often in the absence of maternofetal pathogen translocation. Despite GBS being the most frequent bacterium colonizing pregnant women, no preclinical studies have investigated the impact of end-gestational maternal GBS exposure on the offspring's brain development and its behavioral correlates. Our hypothesis is that GBS-induced gestational infection/inflammation has a deleterious neurodevelopmental impact on uninfected offspring. Our goal was to study the impact of maternal GBS infection on the placental and neurodevelopmental features in the offspring using a new preclinical rat model. GBS-exposed placentas exhibited chorioamnionitis characterized by the presence of Gram-positive cocci and polymorphonuclear cells, with the latter being significantly more prominent in the labyrinth of male offspring. GBS-exposed male offspring had reduced thickness of periventricular white matter. In addition, they exhibited autistic-like behaviors, such as abnormal social interaction and communication, impaired processing of sensory information and hyperactivity. Overall, these data show for the first time that gestational exposure to GBS plays an important role in the generation of neurodevelopmental abnormalities reminiscent of human autism spectrum disorders (ASD). These results provide new evidence in favor of the role of a common and modifiable infectious/inflammatory environmental factor in human ASD pathophysiology.

"Lack of empathy is one of the behavioral hallmarks in individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) as well as youth with conduct disorder symptoms (CDS). Previous research has reliably documented considerable overlap between the perception of others' pain and first-hand experience of pain. However, the linkage between empathy for pain and sensitivity to physical pain needs to be empirically determined, particularly in individuals with empathy deficits. This study measured the pressure pain threshold, which indexes sensitization of peripheral nociceptors, and assessed subjective ratings of unpleasantness and pain intensity in response to empathy-eliciting stimuli depicting physical bodily injuries in three age- and sex-matched participant groups: ASC, CDS, and typically developing controls (TDC). The results indicated that the pain threshold was lowest in the ASC group and highest in the CDS group. The ASC group displayed lower ratings of unpleasantness and pain intensity than did the TDC and CDS groups. Within the ASC and CDS, pain intensity ratings were significantly correlated with unpleasantness ratings to others' pain. Moreover, the ASC significantly differed from the TDC in the correlation between pain threshold values and unpleasantness ratings. These findings may cast some light on the linkage between atypical low-level sensory functioning, for instance altered pain sensitivity, and high-level empathic processing.

"It has been suggested that an early deficit in the human mirror neuron system (MNS) is an important feature of autism. Recent findings related to simple hand and finger movements do not support a general dysfunction of the MNS in autism. Studies investigating facial actions (e.g., emotional expressions) have been more consistent, however, mostly relied on passive observation tasks. We used a new variant of a compatibility task for the assessment of automatic facial mimicry responses that allowed for simultaneous control of attention to facial stimuli. We used facial electromyography in 18 children and adolescents with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 18 typically developing controls (TDCs). We observed a robust compatibility effect in ASD, that is, the execution of a facial expression was facilitated if a congruent facial expression was observed. Time course analysis of RT distributions and comparison to a classic compatibility task (symbolic Simon task) revealed that the facial compatibility effect appeared early and increased with time, suggesting fast and sustained activation of motor codes during observation of facial expressions. We observed a negative correlation of the compatibility effect with age across participants and in ASD, and a positive correlation between self-rated empathy and congruency for smiling faces in TDC but not in ASD.

"Clinical diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be conceptualized as the extreme end of the distribution of subclinical autistic traits related to genetic susceptibility factors (broad autism phenotype (BAP)) in the general population.

"The inbred mouse strain BTBR T<sup>+</sup> Itpr3<sup>tf</sup> /J (BTBR) is studied as a model of idiopathic autism because they are less social and more resistant to change than other strains. Forebrain serotonin receptors and the response to serotonin drugs are altered in BTBR mice, yet it remains unknown if serotonin neurons themselves are abnormal. In this study, we found that serotonin tissue content and the density of serotonin axons is reduced in the hippocampus of BTBR mice in comparison to C57BL/6J (C57) mice. This was accompanied by possible compensatory changes in serotonin neurons that were most pronounced in regions known to provide innervation to the hippocampus: the caudal dorsal raphe (B6) and the median raphe. These changes included increased numbers of serotonin neurons and hyperactivation of Fos expression. Metrics of serotonin neurons in the rostral 2/3 of the dorsal raphe and serotonin content of the prefrontal cortex were less impacted. Thus, serotonin neurons exhibit region-dependent abnormalities in the BTBR mouse that may contribute to their altered behavioral profile.

"Theory and research suggest that vocal development predicts ""useful speech"" in preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but conventional methods for measurement of vocal development are costly and time consuming. This longitudinal correlational study examines the reliability and validity of several automated indices of vocalization development relative to an index derived from human coded, conventional communication samples in a sample of preverbal preschoolers with ASD. Automated indices of vocal development were derived using software that is presently ""in development"" and/or only available for research purposes and using commercially available Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA) software. Indices of vocal development that could be derived using the software available for research purposes: (a) were highly stable with a single day-long audio recording, (b) predicted future spoken vocabulary to a degree that was nonsignificantly different from the index derived from conventional communication samples, and (c) continued to predict future spoken vocabulary even after controlling for concurrent vocabulary in our sample. The score derived from standard LENA software was similarly stable, but was not significantly correlated with future spoken vocabulary. Findings suggest that automated vocal analysis is a valid and reliable alternative to time intensive and expensive conventional communication samples for measurement of vocal development of preverbal preschoolers with ASD in research and clinical practice.

"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been associated with reduced orienting to social stimuli such as eyes, but the results are inconsistent. It is not known whether atypicalities in phasic alerting could play a role in putative altered social orienting in ASD. Here, we show that in unisensory (visual) trials, children with ASD are slower to orient to eyes (among distractors) than controls matched for age, sex, and nonverbal IQ. However, in another condition where a brief spatially nonpredictive sound was presented just before the visual targets, this group effect was reversed. Our results indicate that orienting to social versus nonsocial stimuli is differently modulated by phasic alerting mechanisms in young children with ASD.

"SLC9A9 is a sodium hydrogen exchanger present in the recycling endosome and highly expressed in the brain. It is implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Little research concerning its gene expression patterns and biological pathways has been conducted. We sought to investigate its possible biological roles in autism-associated brain regions throughout development. We conducted a weighted gene co-expression network analysis on RNA-seq data downloaded from Brainspan. We compared prenatal and postnatal gene expression networks for three ASD-associated brain regions known to have high SLC9A9 gene expression. We also performed an ASD-associated single nucleotide polymorphism enrichment analysis and a cell signature enrichment analysis. The modules showed differences in gene constituents (membership), gene number, and connectivity throughout time. SLC9A9 was highly associated with immune system functions, metabolism, apoptosis, endocytosis, and signaling cascades. Gene list comparison with co-immunoprecipitation data was significant for multiple modules. We found a disproportionately high autism risk signal among genes constituting the prenatal hippocampal module. The modules were enriched with astrocyte and oligodendrocyte markers. SLC9A9 is potentially involved in the pathophysiology of ASDs. Our investigation confirmed proposed functions for SLC9A9, such as endocytosis and immune regulation, while also revealing potential roles in mTOR signaling and cell survival.. By providing a concise molecular map and interactions, evidence of cell type and implicated brain regions we hope this will guide future research on SLC9A9.

"Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) tend to show distinctive, atypical acoustic patterns of speech. These behaviors affect social interactions and social development and could represent a non-invasive marker for ASD. We systematically reviewed the literature quantifying acoustic patterns in ASD. Search terms were: (prosody OR intonation OR inflection OR intensity OR pitch OR fundamental frequency OR speech rate OR voice quality OR acoustic) AND (autis* OR Asperger). Results were filtered to include only: empirical studies quantifying acoustic features of vocal production in ASD, with a sample size &gt;2, and the inclusion of a neurotypical comparison group and/or correlations between acoustic measures and severity of clinical features. We identified 34 articles, including 30 univariate studies and 15 multivariate machine-learning studies. We performed meta-analyses of the univariate studies, identifying significant differences in mean pitch and pitch range between individuals with ASD and comparison participants (Cohen's d of 0.4-0.5 and discriminatory accuracy of about 61-64%). The multivariate studies reported higher accuracies than the univariate studies (63-96%). However, the methods used and the acoustic features investigated were too diverse for performing meta-analysis. We conclude that multivariate studies of acoustic patterns are a promising but yet unsystematic avenue for establishing ASD markers.

"Genome-wide expression studies of samples derived from individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their unaffected siblings have been widely used to shed light on transcriptomic differences associated with this condition. Females have historically been under-represented in ASD genomic studies. Emerging evidence from studies of structural genetic variants and peripheral biomarkers suggest that sex-differences may exist in the biological correlates of ASD. Relatively few studies have explicitly examined whether sex-differences exist in the transcriptomic signature of ASD. The present study quantified genome-wide expression values by performing RNA sequencing on transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines and identified transcripts differentially expressed between same-sex, proximal-aged sibling pairs. We found that performing separate analyses for each sex improved our ability to detect ASD-related transcriptomic differences; we observed a larger number of dysregulated genes within our smaller set of female samples (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;12 sibling pairs), as compared with the set of male samples (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;24 sibling pairs), with small, but statistically significant overlap between the sexes.

"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability in humans. In addition to cognitive impairment, patients may exhibit hyperactivity, attention deficits, social difficulties and anxiety, and autistic-like behaviors. The degree to which patients display these behaviors varies considerably and is influenced by family history, suggesting that genetic modifiers play a role in the expression of behaviors in FXS. Several studies have examined behavior in a mouse model of FXS in which the Fmr1 gene has been ablated. Most of those studies were done in Fmr1 knockout mice on a pure C57BL/6 or FVB strain background. To gain a better understanding of the effects of genetic background on behaviors resulting from the loss of Fmr1 gene expression, we generated F1 hybrid lines from female Fmr1 heterozygous mice on a pure C57BL/6J background bred with male Fmr1 wild-type (WT) mice of various background strains (A/J, DBA/2J, FVB/NJ, 129S1/SvImJ and CD-1). Male Fmr1 knockout and WT littermates from each line were examined in an extensive behavioral test battery. Results clearly indicate that multiple behavioral responses are dependent on genetic background, including autistic-like traits that are present on limited genetic backgrounds.

"Sensory atypicalities are a common feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To date, the relationship between sensory atypicalities in dyads of children with ASD and their parents has not been investigated. Exploring these relationships can contribute to an understanding of how phenotypic profiles may be inherited, and the extent to which familial factors might contribute towards children's sensory profiles and constitute an aspect of the broader autism phenotype (BAP). Parents of 44 children with ASD and 30 typically developing (TD) children, aged between 3 and 14 years, participated. Information about children's sensory experiences was collected through parent report using the Sensory Profile questionnaire. Information about parental sensory experiences was collected via self-report using the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile. Parents of children with ASD had significantly higher scores than parents of TD children in relation to low registration, over responsivity, and taste/smell sensory processing. Similar levels of agreement were obtained within ASD and TD parent-child dyads on a number of sensory atypicalities; nevertheless significant correlations were found between parents and children in ASD families but not TD dyads for sensation avoiding and auditory, visual, and vestibular sensory processing.

"Findings of studies investigating OXTR SNP rs53576 (G-A) variation in social behavior have been inconsistent, possibly because DNA methylation after stress exposure was eliminated from consideration. Our goal was to examine OXTR rs53576 allele-specific sensitivity for neonatal OXTR DNA methylation in relation to (1) a prenatal maternal stress composite, and (2) child autistic traits. Prospective data from fetal life to age 6 years were collected in a total of 743 children participating in the Generation R Study.

A Special Interest Group (SIG) was convened at the International Meeting for Autism Research in May 2014 and May 2015, with a focus on transitional and vocational issues in ASD. The SIG consisted of 120 international delegates, including self-advocates, family members, researchers, program and policy developers, practitioners, and interdisciplinary ASD trainees. Following a summary of the literature, subgroups of attendees were convened in smaller groups to identify research needs and priorities. International researchers facilitated these discussions with notes taken in each subgroup. Using a qualitative analytic approach, key themes across groups were identified. These key themes, outlined in this paper, address the identified need to (a) advance research capacity; (b) build employer capacity relative to employing persons with ASD; and (c) enhance support resources for adults with ASD and their families. Heightened research activity guiding practice and policy, community/employer engagement, and person and family-centered services were recommended. Implications for advancement and implementation are offered.

"Aberrant connectivity is believed to contribute to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Recent neuroimaging studies have increasingly identified such impairments in patients with ASD, including alterations in sensory systems. However, the cellular substrates and molecular underpinnings of disrupted connectivity remain poorly understood. Utilizing eye-specific segregation in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) as a model system, we investigated the formation and refinement of precise patterning of synaptic connections in the BTBR T&#x2009;+&#x2009;tf/J (BTBR) mouse model of ASD. We found that at the neonatal stage, the shape of the dLGN occupied by retinal afferents was altered in the BTBR group compared to C57BL/6J (B6) animals. Notably, the degree of overlap between the ipsi- and contralateral afferents was significantly greater in the BTBR mice. Moreover, these abnormalities continued into mature stage in the BTBR animals, suggesting persistent deficits rather than delayed maturation of axonal refinement. Together, these results indicate disrupted connectivity at the synaptic patterning level in the BTBR mice, suggesting that in general, altered neural circuitry may contribute to autistic behaviours seen in this animal model. In addition, these data are consistent with the notion that lower-level, primary processing mechanisms contribute to altered visual perception in ASD.

"To measure urine indolylacroylglycine (IAG) excretion using the IAG:creatinine ratio in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared with two groups of age matched controls, one with special needs but without ASD (SEN) and one typically developing (TD) and in subgroups with/without current gastrointestinal problems and ASD with and without regression. IAG:creatinine ratio was measured in the urine of 279 children aged 10-14 years: 129 children with ASD (28 with and 101 without regression), 62 SEN controls and 88 TD controls. The prevalence of gastro-intestinal symptoms (GIS) was recorded. No differences were found in the urine IAG:creatinine ratio among groups ASD, TD and SEN; nor in the ASD groups with/without regression, nor in those with/without GIS. This study finds no evidence of increased urine IAG excretion in children with ASD, with or without GIS or with or without regression. Urinary IAG measurements in children with ASD offer no support for increased presence of neuroactive peptides proposed to result from increased gut permeability. We found measurement of urinary IAG to have no value in the diagnosis of autism or in the dietary management of children with ASD.

"Identifying genes involved in social behavior is important for autism research. Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a developmental syndrome with unique neurocognitive features, including low IQ, deficits in visuospatial and visual-motor abilities, hypersensitivity to sounds, hypersociability, and increased general anxiety. The syndrome is caused by a recurrent hemizygous deletion of the 7q11.23 region, containing about 28 genes. One of genes in the region, GTF2I, has been implicated in the hypersociability and visuospatial deficits of WBS based on genotype-phenotype correlation studies of patients with atypical deletions. In order to clarify the involvement of GTF2I in neurocognitive function, especially social behavior, we have developed and characterized Gtf2i-deficient mice. We found that homozygous deletion of Gtf2i causes lethality during embryonic development with neural tube closure defects and exencephaly, consistent with other reports. Gtf2i heterozygous animals show no gross changes in brain structure or development. Furthermore, heterozygous animals show no alterations in learning and memory, including spatial memory as assessed by the Morris water maze, but show alterations in the recognition of novel objects. Interestingly, they show increased social interaction with unfamiliar mice and do not show typical social habituation processes, reminiscent of the hypersociability observed in WBS patients. The mice do not appear to show increased anxiety, supporting a specific effect of Gtf2i on defined domains of the WBS phenotype. These data indicate that Gtf2i is involved in several aspects of embryonic development and the development of social neurocircuitry and that GTF2I haploinsufficiency could be a contributor to the hypersociability in WBS patients.","Identifying genes involved in social behavior is important for autism research.

"Current research suggests that incidence and heterogeneity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms may arise through a variety of exogenous and/or endogenous factors. While subject to routine clinical practice and generally considered safe, there exists speculation, though no human data, that diagnostic ultrasound may also contribute to ASD severity, supported by experimental evidence that exposure to ultrasound early in gestation could perturb brain development and alter behavior. Here we explored a modified triple hit hypothesis [Williams &amp; Casanova, ] to assay for a possible relationship between the severity of ASD symptoms and (1) ultrasound exposure (2) during the first trimester of pregnancy in fetuses with a (3) genetic predisposition to ASD. We did so using retrospective analysis of data from the SSC (Simon's Simplex Collection) autism genetic repository funded by the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative. We found that male children with ASD, copy number variations (CNVs), and exposure to first trimester ultrasound had significantly decreased non-verbal IQ and increased repetitive behaviors relative to male children with ASD, with CNVs, and no ultrasound. These data suggest that heterogeneity in ASD symptoms may result, at least in part, from exposure to diagnostic ultrasound during early prenatal development of children with specific genetic vulnerabilities. These results also add weight to on-going concerns expressed by the FDA about non-medical use of diagnostic ultrasound during pregnancy.

"Extensive research efforts in the last decade have been expended into understanding whether intranasal oxytocin may be an effective therapeutic in treating social communication impairments in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). After much hyped early findings, subsequent clinical trials of longer-term administration have yielded more conservative and mixed evidence. However, it is still unclear at this stage whether these more disappointing findings reflect a true null effect or are mitigated by methodological differences masking true effects. In this review, we comprehensively evaluate the rationale for oxytocin as a therapeutic, evaluating evidence from randomized controlled trials, case reports, and open-label studies of oxytocin administration in individuals with ASD. The evidence to date, including reviews of preregistered trials, suggests a number of critical considerations for the design and interpretation of research in this area. These include considering the choice of ASD outcome measures, dosing and nasal spray device issues, and participant selection. Despite these limitations in the field to date, there remains significant potential for oxytocin to ameliorate aspects of the persistent and debilitating social impairments in individuals with ASD. Given the considerable media hype around new treatments for ASD, as well as the needs of eager families, there is an urgent need for researchers to prioritise considering such factors when conducting well-designed and controlled studies to further advance this field.

"Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have long been known to have deficits in the performance of praxis gestures; these motor deficits also correlate with social and communicative deficits. To date, the precise nature of the errors involved in praxis has not been clearly mapped out. Based on observations of individuals with ASD performing gestures, we hypothesized that the simultaneous execution of multiple movement elements is especially impaired in affected children. We examined 25 school-aged participants with ASD and 25 age-matched controls performing seven simultaneous gestures that required the concurrent performance of movement elements and nine serial gestures, in which all elements were performed serially. There was indeed a group &#xd7; gesture-type interaction (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Whereas both groups had greater difficulty performing simultaneous than serial gestures, children with ASD had a 2.6-times greater performance decrement with simultaneous (vs. serial) gestures than controls. These results point to a potential deficit in the simultaneous processing of multiple inputs and outputs in ASD. Such deficits could relate to models of social interaction that highlight the parallel-processing nature of social communication.

"Individuals with autism exhibit hypersensitivity to local elements of the input, which may interfere with the ability to group visual elements perceptually. We investigated the development of perceptual grouping abilities in high-functioning individuals with autism (HFA) across a wide age range (8-30 years) using a classic compound letter global/local (GL) task and a more fine-grained microgenetic prime paradigm (MPP), including both few- and many-element hierarchical displays. In the GL task, contrary to the typically developing (TD) controls, HFA participants did not develop an increasing sensitivity to the global information with age. In the MPP, like the TD controls, individuals with autism at all three age groups evinced a bias to individuate the few-element displays. However, contrary to the TD controls, the HFA group failed to show age-related improvements in the ability to encode the global shape of the many-element displays. In fact, across the age range, the HFA group was consistently faster than the TD controls at perceiving the local elements in these displays. These results indicate that in autism the full process of garnering shape information from perceptual grouping, which is essential for the ability to do fast and efficient object recognition and identification, never matures, and this is especially evident in adolescence when this ability begins to improve in TD individuals. The atypical development of these perceptual organizational abilities may disrupt processing of visually presented objects, which may, in turn, fundamentally impede the development of major aspects of the social and emotional behaviors in individuals with autism.","Individuals with autism exhibit hypersensitivity to local elements of the input, which may interfere with the ability to group visual elements perceptually.

"This study examined the relationship between the broader autism phenotype (BAP) and depressed mood in mothers of children with and without autism spectrum disorders (ASD). One hundred and sixty-five mothers (71 with an ASD child and 94 with a non-ASD child) completed a survey of child autism severity (ASD mothers only), parenting stress, BAP, and depression. Mothers of children with ASD reported greater depressed mood, higher parenting stress, and more characteristics associated with the BAP than mothers of children without ASD. For mothers of children with ASD, the BAP uniquely predicted number of depressive symptoms after controlling for child autism severity and parenting stress. In the full sample, the relationship between group status and depressed mood was no longer significant after controlling for parenting stress and maternal BAP. These findings suggest that the higher rate of depression found in mothers of children with ASD may be attributed both to the increased stress of raising a child with ASD, as well as a greater number of autistic features in the mothers that may place them at higher risk for developing depression.",This study examined the relationship between the broader autism phenotype (BAP) and depressed mood in mothers of children with and without autism spectrum disorders (ASD).,"One hundred and sixty-five mothers (71 with an ASD child and 94 with a non-ASD child) completed a survey of child autism severity (ASD mothers only), parenting stress, BAP, and depression.","Mothers of children with ASD reported greater depressed mood, higher parenting stress, and more characteristics associated with the BAP than mothers of children without ASD.

"Auditory hyper-reactivity is a common sensory-perceptual abnormality that interrupts behavioral adaptations in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Recently, prolonged acoustic startle response (ASR) latency and hyper-reactivity to weak acoustic stimuli were reported in children with ASD. Indexes of ASR and its modulation are known to be stable biological markers for translational research in the adult population. However, little is known about the stability of these indexes in children. Thus, the objective of our study was to investigate the stability of neurophysiological ASR indexes in children with ASD and typical development (TD). Participants included 12 children with ASD and 24 with TD. Mean startle magnitudes to acoustic stimuli presented at 65-105 dB in increments of 10 dB were analyzed. Average peak startle latency (PSL), ASR modulation of habituation, and prepulse inhibition were also analyzed. These startle measures were examined after a follow-up period of 15.7&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.1 months from baseline. At both baseline and in the follow-up period, children with ASD had significantly greater startle magnitudes to weak stimuli of 65-85 dB and more prolonged PSL compared with controls. Intraclass correlation coefficients for these ASR measures between both periods were 0.499-0.705. None of the ASR measures differed significantly between the two periods.

"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder mainly showed atypical social interaction, communication, and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests and activities. Now clinic diagnosis of ASD is mostly based on psychological evaluation, clinical observation and medical history. All these behavioral indexes could not avoid defects such as subjectivity and reporter-dependency. Therefore researchers devoted themselves to seek relatively stable biomarkers of ASD as supplementary diagnostic evidence. The goal of present study is to generate relatively stable predictive model based on anatomical brain features by using machine learning technique. Forty-six ASD children and thirty-nine development delay children aged from 18 to 37 months were evolved in. As a result, the predictive model generated by regional average cortical thickness of regions with top 20 highest importance of random forest classifier showed best diagnostic performance. And random forest was proved to be the optimal approach for neuroimaging data mining in small size set and thickness-based classification outperformed volume-based classification and surface area-based classification in ASD. The brain regions selected by the models might attract attention and the idea of considering biomarkers as a supplementary evidence of ASD diagnosis worth exploring.

Now clinic diagnosis of ASD is mostly based on psychological evaluation, clinical observation and medical history. All these behavioral indexes could not avoid defects such as subjectivity and reporter-dependency. Therefore researchers devoted themselves to seek relatively stable biomarkers of ASD as supplementary diagnostic evidence.",The goal of present study is to generate relatively stable predictive model based on anatomical brain features by using machine learning technique. Forty-six ASD children and thirty-nine development delay children aged from 18 to 37 months were evolved in.,"As a result, the predictive model generated by regional average cortical thickness of regions with top 20 highest importance of random forest classifier showed best diagnostic performance. And random forest was proved to be the optimal approach for neuroimaging data mining in small size set and thickness-based classification outperformed volume-based classification and surface area-based classification in ASD. The brain regions selected by the models might attract attention and the idea of considering biomarkers as a supplementary evidence of ASD diagnosis worth exploring.

"Variation in the AVPR1a gene, which codes for a receptor for the neurohormone vasopressin, has been found to relate to autism risk. Interestingly, variation in this gene also relates to differences in social behaviour in non-clinical populations. Variation in this gene may affect expression of AVPR1a receptors in brain areas involved in social behaviour. Here, we tested whether AVPR1a variation was associated with Autism Quotient (AQ) scores, a questionnaire that measures non-clinical manifestations of autism, in a population of 873 healthy university students. The AVPR1a RS1 and RS3 microsatellites were examined, and variants were categorized as ""long"" or ""short"". The RS3 long/long genotype was significantly associated with a higher AQ score (i.e., a more autistic-like phenotype) for the combined population and for females only. Further examination showed that this relationship was due to a specific RS3 variant, termed the ""target allele"", which previous research has linked to reduced altruism and increased marital problems in healthy individuals. We also observed that the relationship between RS3 genotype and AQ score was mainly due to the ""attention switching"" (the ability to shift attention from one task to another) component of the questionnaire; this ability is commonly impaired in autism spectrum disorders. Overall, our study establishes continuity between the existing AVPR1a research in clinical and non-clinical populations. Our results suggest that vasopressin may exert its effects on social behaviour in part by modulating attentional focus between social and non-social cues.

"Emotion recognition (ER) and understanding deficits are characteristic of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The Transporters (TT) animated series has shown promising results in teaching children with ASD to recognize emotions, with mixed findings about generalization and maintenance of effects. This study aimed to evaluate the unique role of TT and of parental support in the acquisition, generalization, and maintenance of acquired ER skills in children with ASD. 77 Israeli children with high functioning ASD, aged 4-7 were randomly assigned into four groups according to a 2 &#xd7; 2 design of the factors Series (TT, control series) and Parental Support (with/without). Thirty typically developing children, matched to the ASD groups on mental age, were tested with no intervention. Participants' ER (on three generalization levels) and emotional vocabulary (EV) were tested pre and post 8 weeks of intervention, and at 3 months' follow-up. Compared to the control series, watching TT significantly improved children's ER skills at all generalization levels, with good skill maintenance. All groups improved equally on EV. The amount of parental support given, in the groups that had received it, contributed to the generalization and maintenance of ER skills. Autism severity negatively correlated with ER improvement. The current study provides evidence to the unique role of TT in ER skill acquisition, generalization, and maintenance in children with high functioning ASD.

"Candidate risk genes for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been identified, but the challenge of determining their contribution to pathogenesis remains. We previously identified two ASD risk genes encoding the receptor tyrosine kinase MET and the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (PLAUR), which is thought to modulate availability of the MET ligand. We also reported a role for Met signaling in cortical interneuron development in vitro and a reduction of these neurons in uPAR (mouse ortholog of PLAUR) null mice, suggesting that disruption of either gene impacts cortical development similarly. Here, we modify this conclusion, reporting that interneuron numbers are unchanged in the neocortex of Met(fx/fx) / Dlx5/6(cre) mice, in which Met is ablated from cells arising from the ventral telencephalon (VTel). Consistent with this, Met transcript is not detected in the VTel during interneuron genesis and migration; furthermore, during the postnatal period of interneuron maturation, Met is co-expressed in glutamatergic projection neurons, but not interneurons. Low levels of Met protein are expressed in the VTel at E12.5 and E14.5, likely reflecting the arrival of Met containing corticofugal axons. Met expression, however, is induced in E12.5 VTel cells after 2 days in vitro, perhaps underlying discrepancies between observations in vitro and in Met(fx/fx) / Dlx5/6(cre) mice. We suggest that, in vivo, Met impacts the development of cortical projection neurons, whereas uPAR influences interneuron maturation. An altered balance between excitation and inhibition has been postulated as a biological mechanism for ASD; this imbalance could arise from different risk genes differentially affecting either or both elements.","Candidate risk genes for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been identified, but the challenge of determining their contribution to pathogenesis remains.

"Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggest the prevalence of asymptomatic ""incidental"" findings (IF) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is similar to that of neurotypically developing (NT) controls.

"Executive functioning (EF) is thought to be linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD) specific symptoms. The majority of research has focused on children and adolescents with ASD and, therefore, little is known about EF in adults. Furthermore, little is known about gender differences. Ninety-nine men and forty women with ASD were compared with and 35 neurotypical men 25 neurotypical women. Participants were matched on age, total intelligence, and verbal ability. The following instruments were used to measure executive functioning: digit span and letter and number sequencing of the WAIS-III, Tower of Hanoi, WCST, and Verbal fluency. Multiple analysis of variance was conducted to determine group differences. Women with ASD performed worse on the working memory tasks of the WAIS-III than neurotypical women. Furthermore, women with ASD had more perseverations on the WCST than neurotypical women. The gender comparison in the ASD group showed differences in performance on mental flexibility (WCST), working memory (WAIS-III), generativity and self-monitoring (Verbal fluency). However, these differences were unequivocal and no gender specific cognitive profile could be pinpointed. Individual strengths and frailties should be highlighted in clinical practice, as impairments in EF can be under influence of the overall cognitive abilities of the individual. Furthermore, gender differences were found. This could explain differences in representation of ASD symptoms in both groups. These differences show how important thorough diagnostics are.

"There is evidence that some maternal infections during the prenatal period are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as childhood autism. However, the association between autism and Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), an intracellular parasite, remains unclear. The authors examined whether serologically confirmed maternal antibodies to T. gondii are associated with odds of childhood autism in offspring. The study is based on a nested case-control design of a large national birth cohort (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.2 million) and the national psychiatric registries in Finland. There were 874 cases of childhood autism and controls matched 1:1 on date of birth, sex, birthplace and residence in Finland. Maternal sera were prospectively assayed from a national biobank for T. gondii IgM and IgG antibodies; IgG avidity analyses were also performed. High maternal T. gondii IgM antibody was associated with a significantly decreased odds of childhood autism. Low maternal T. gondii IgG antibody was associated with increased offspring odds of autism. In women with high T. gondii IgM antibodies, the IgG avidity was high for both cases and controls, with the exception of three controls. The findings suggest that the relationship between maternal T. gondii antibodies and odds of childhood autism may be related to the immune response to this pathogen or the overall activation of the immune system.

"Existing literature on the profile of executive dysfunction in autism spectrum disorder showed inconsistent results.

"Diagnostic bias is a concern in autism spectrum conditions (ASC) where prevalence and presentation differ by sex. To ensure that females with ASC are not under-identified, it is important that ASC screening tools do not systematically underestimate autistic traits in females relative to males. We evaluated whether the AQ-10, a brief screen for ASC recommended by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence in cases of suspected ASC, exhibits such a bias. Using an item response theory approach, we evaluated differential item functioning and differential test functioning. We found that although individual items showed some sex bias, these biases at times favored males and at other times favored females. Thus, at the level of test scores the item-level biases cancelled out to give an unbiased overall score. Results support the continued use of the AQ-10 sum score in its current form; however, suggest that caution should be exercised when interpreting responses to individual items.

"Recent evidence for abnormal thalamic connectivity in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and sensory processing disorders suggests the thalamus may play a role in sensory over-responsivity (SOR), an extreme negative response to sensory stimuli, which is common in ASD. However, there is yet little understanding of changes in thalamic connectivity during exposure to aversive sensory inputs in individuals with ASD. In particular, the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus is implicated in atypical sensory processing given its role in selective attention, regulation, and sensory integration. This study aimed to examine the role of pulvinar connectivity in ASD during mildly aversive sensory input. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine connectivity with the pulvinar during exposure to mildly aversive auditory and tactile stimuli in 38 youth (age 9-17; 19 ASD, 19 IQ-matched typically developing (TD)). Parents rated children's SOR severity on two standard scales. Compared to TD, ASD participants displayed aberrant modulation of connectivity between pulvinar and cortex (including sensory-motor and prefrontal regions) during sensory stimulation. In ASD participants, pulvinar-amygdala connectivity was correlated with severity of SOR symptoms. Deficits in modulation of thalamocortical connectivity in youth with ASD may reflect reduced thalamo-cortical inhibition in response to sensory stimulation, which could lead to difficulty filtering out and/or integrating sensory information. An increase in amygdala connectivity with the pulvinar might be partially responsible for deficits in selective attention as the amygdala signals the brain to attend to distracting sensory stimuli.

"Children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) demonstrate atypical processing of, and memory for, self-referenced information, which may contribute to the heightened rates of co-occurring internalizing problems. We assessed affective and cognitive aspects of self-referential processing in verbally-fluent children with ASD (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;79), and an age-matched comparison sample (COM, N&#x2009;=&#x2009;73) of children without an autism diagnosis. We examined group differences in these two aspects of the self-system, and their joint contributions to individual differnces in internalizing problems. Using a self-referenced memory (SRM) task, participants indicated whether a series of positive and negative trait adjectives described themselves and a well-known fictional character. Participants were then surprised with a recognition memory test on the same adjectives. Overall, individuals with ASD showed a reduction in the extent to which they preferentially endorsed positive over negative trait adjectives about themselves, and a reduction in their preferential memory for self- over other-referenced information. Across the full sample, these two aspects of self-referential processing jointly predicted self-reported internalizing problems. Specifically, self-evaluations were strongly and inversely associated with internalizing problems but only for children with relatively high SRM. These findings suggest that the salience of the self influences the extent to which affective self-evaluations impact emotional functioning for youth both with and without ASD. Implications for basic (e.g., developmental) and translational (e.g., intervention) research are discussed.

"Previous research suggests that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficulties with inference generation in reading tasks. However, most previous studies have examined how well children understand a text after reading or have measured on-line reading behavior without response to questions. The aim of this study was to investigate the online strategies of children and adolescents with autism during reading and at the same time responding to a question by monitoring their eye movements. The reading behavior of participants with ASD was compared with that of age-, language-, nonverbal intelligence-, reading-, and receptive language skills-matched participants without ASD (control group). The results showed that the ASD group were as accurate as the control group in generating inferences when answering questions about the short texts, and no differences were found between the two groups in the global paragraph reading and responding times. However, the ASD group displayed longer gaze latencies on a target word necessary to produce an inference. They also showed more regressions into the word that supported the inference compared to the control group after reading the question, irrespective of whether an inference was required or not. In conclusion, the ASD group achieved an equivalent level of inferential comprehension, but showed subtle differences in reading comprehension strategies compared to the control group.

"Restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) are a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Compared to the social-communication impairments, we know considerably less about why children engage in RRBs and if and how to intervene with these behaviors. As a result, early intervention has typically focused on social-communication. In this study, we were interested in understanding how child RRBs changed following an intervention targeting social-communication behaviors and if caregiver training changed how they responded to their child's RRBs. Eighty-six toddlers with ASD and their caregivers received one of two interventions: caregivers were either actively coached while playing with their child (JASPER) or attended information sessions about ASD. On three different occasions (when they entered the study, following 10 weeks of intervention and 6-months after) caregivers were filmed playing with their child. From these recordings, we coded child RRBs and caregiver responses to these behaviors. Child RRBs remained relatively stable following intervention in both groups, but increased when the children returned at 6-months. Caregivers who received one-on-one coaching (JASPER) responded to a greater number of their child's RRBs and their responses were rated as more successful. Our study showed that a short-term social-communication intervention delivered through caregivers had ""spillover effects"" on how they also responded to their child's RRBs.

"Overlapping social impairments in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Schizophrenia (SCZ) contributed to decades of diagnostic confusion that continues to this day in some clinical settings. The current study provides the first direct and detailed comparison of social behavior in the two disorders by identifying profiles of social skill in adults with ASD (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;54), SCZ (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;54), and typically developing (TD) controls (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;56) during a real-world social interaction. ASD and SCZ groups exhibited poorer social skill, both overall and on most discrete abilities, relative to the TD group. Direct comparison of ASD to SCZ revealed distinct behavioral profiles, with ASD uniquely characterized by fewer interactive behaviors, and SCZ characterized by greater impaired gaze and flat/inappropriate affective responses. Additionally, IQ was associated with both overall social skill and many discrete social skills in SCZ, but was largely unrelated to social skill in ASD. These results indicate that overlapping social deficits in ASD and SCZ are comprised of both shared and distinct social skill impairments. The largest distinctions-reduced social reciprocity but better expressivity in ASD relative to SCZ, and a greater role of IQ in social skill for SCZ than ASD-highlight disorder-specific features that can improve etiological understanding, diagnostic differentiation, and treatment strategies.

"Reduced use of eye contact is a prominent feature in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It has been proposed that direct gaze does not capture the attention of individuals with ASD. Experimental evidence is, however, mainly restricted to relatively high-functioning school-aged children or adults with ASD. This study investigated whether 2-5-year-old low-functioning children with severe ASD differ from control children in orienting to gaze stimuli, as measured with the heart rate deceleration response. Responses were measured to computerized presentations of dynamic shifts of gaze direction either toward (direct) or away (averted) from the observing child. The results showed a significant group by gaze direction interaction effect on heart rate responses (permuted P&#x2009;=&#x2009;.004), reflecting a stronger orienting response to direct versus averted gaze in typically developing (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;17) and developmentally delayed (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;16) children but not in children with ASD (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;12).

"It is now widely accepted that individuals with autism have a Theory of Mind (ToM) or mentalizing deficit. This has traditionally been assessed with false-belief tasks and, more recently, with silent geometric animations, an on-line ToM task. In adults with milder forms of autism standard false-belief tests, originally devised for children, often prove insensitive, while the Frith-Happ&#xe9; animations have had rather better success at capturing the on-line ToM deficit in this population. However, analysis of participants' verbal descriptions of these animations, which span scenarios from ""Random"" to ""Goal-Directed"" and ""ToM,"" is time consuming and subjective. In this study, we developed and established the feasibility of an objective method of response through a series of multiple-choice questions. Sixteen adults with autism and 15 typically developing adults took part, matched for age and intelligence. The adults with autism were less accurate as a group at categorizing the Frith-Happ&#xe9; animations by the presence or absence of mental and physical interactions. Furthermore, they were less able to select the correct emotions that are typically attributed to the triangles in the mental state animations. This new objective method for assessing the understanding of the animations succeeded in being as sensitive as the original subjective method in detecting the mentalizing difficulties in autism, as well as being quicker and easier to administer and analyze.","It is now widely accepted that individuals with autism have a Theory of Mind (ToM) or mentalizing deficit.

"The purpose of this study was to investigate pupillary light reflex (PLR) in 2-6-years-old children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A total of 117 medication-free 2-6-year-old boys participated in this study. Sixty participants were diagnosed with ASD (the ""ASD group"") and the other 57 were in the control group of typical development (the ""TD group""). A questionnaire was completed by the parent/guardian for assessing potential dysfunctions in the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The base pupil radius, PLR latency, and constriction time showed a significant age-related trend in both the ASD and TD groups. The base pupil size increased with age in the typically developing children, but not in the ASD group. The ASD group showed more symptoms related to ANS dysfunctions.

"Pronounced heterogeneity is apparent across every facet of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and it remains difficult to predict likely future potential among individuals who share a common diagnosis of ASD on the basis of early presentation. In this commentary we argue that a fine-grained understanding of individual differences in sensory features and their influence across the life span can constrain noted clinical heterogeneity in ASD. We organize our discussion around the following three critical themes: (a) considering sensory features as dimensional construct; (b) taking an ""individual differences"" approach; and (c) adopting a comprehensive, multidimensional and multimodal approach to measurement of sensory features. We conclude that future research will need to investigate individual differences in sensory features via: (1) multidimensional and cross-disciplinary examination, (2) prospective longitudinal designs, and (3) dimensional and developmental frameworks that emphasize the potential value of early individual variability as indicators of later outcomes, not only in relation to the categorical diagnostic outcome status but also the presence of other clinical features.

"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) make a dishomogeneous group of psychiatric diseases having either genetic and environmental components, including changes of the microbiota. The rate of diagnosis, based on a series of psychological tests and observed behavior, dramatically increased in the past few decades. Currently, no biological markers are available and the pathogenesis is not defined. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential use of <sup>1</sup> H-NMR metabolomics to analyze the global biochemical signature of ASD patients (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21) and controls (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;21), these being siblings of autistic patients. A multivariate model has been used to extrapolate the variables of importance. The discriminating urinary metabolites were identified; in particular, significantly increased levels of hippurate, glycine, creatine, tryptophan, and d-threitol and decreased concentrations of glutamate, creatinine, lactate, valine, betaine, and taurine were observed in ASD patients. Based on the identified discriminant metabolites, the attention was focused on two possible mechanisms that could be involved in ASD: oxidative stress conditions and gut microflora modifications.

"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by impairments in reciprocal social communication, and stereotyped verbal and nonverbal behaviors. In approximately 10-25% of the affected individuals, a genetic mutation associated with the condition can be identified. Recently, mutations altering synapse formation, cellular/synaptic growth rate and regulation of excitatory and inhibitory currents were identified in patients with intellectual disability, typical autism, Asperger syndrome or neurological syndromes associated with autistic traits. Following these genetic findings, mouse models carrying mutations similar to those identified in patients have been generated. These models offer the opportunity to investigate in vivo the physiological and behavioral consequences of the mutations. Here, we review the existing data on the phenotypes of mice carrying mutations in genes associated with ASD including neuroligin, neurexin and Shank mutant mice as well as the Fmr1, Mecp2, Ube3a, Nf1, Pten and Tsc1/Tsc2 mutant mice. The diversity and complexity of the phenotype of these mouse models reflect the broad range of phenotypes observed in patients with ASD. Remarkably, results from therapeutic approaches (e.g., modulation of gene expression, administration of pharmacological and nonpharmacological substances, enriched environment) are encouraging since some behavioral alterations could be reversed even when treatment was performed on adult mice. These ongoing studies should therefore increase our understanding of the biological alterations associated with ASD as well as the development of knowledge-based treatments.","Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by impairments in reciprocal social communication, and stereotyped verbal and nonverbal behaviors.

"Aggressive behaviors of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are common. We conducted this study to describe the aggressive mode of preschool children with ASD and examine the associations between specific aggressive behaviors and two treatable factors: sleep problems and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. In total, 577 typically developing (TD) children and 490 children with ASD were investigated in this study. The Institute for Basic Research - Modified Overt Aggression Scale (IBR-MOAS) was used to assess aggressive behaviors. Children's social impairments, sleep problems and ADHD symptoms were also measured with specific scales.

"As the number of adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) grows, the need to identify modifiable correlates of positive outcomes and quality of life (QoL) gains in importance. Research indicates that perceived stress is significantly correlated with QoL in adults with ASD. Studies in the general population of individuals without disabilities indicate that greater participation in social and recreational activities may lessen the negative impact of perceived stress on well-being, and this association may also hold among adults with ASD. We hypothesized that: (1) perceived stress would be negatively associated with QoL; and (2) higher frequency of participation in social activities and recreational activities would moderate the relationship between perceived stress and QoL. We used data collected from 60 adults with ASD aged 24-55 and their mothers to address our hypotheses. Findings indicate that adults with ASD with higher perceived stress are likely to have poorer QoL. Furthermore, greater participation in recreational activities buffers the impact of perceived stress on QoL, but no buffering effect was observed for participation in social activities. These findings suggest that interventions and services that provide supports and opportunities for participation in recreational activities may help adults with ASD manage their stress and lead to better QoL.

"Children with autism vary widely in their language abilities, yet the neural correlates of this language variability remain unclear, especially early in development. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to examine diffusivity measures along the length of 18 major fiber tracts in 104 preschool-aged boys with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The boys were assigned to subgroups according to their level of language development (Low: no/low language, Middle: small vocabulary, High: large vocabulary and grammar), based on their raw scores on the expressive language (EL) and receptive language (RL) sections of the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL). Results indicate that the subgroups differed in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and radial diffusivity (RD) along the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) in both hemispheres. Moreover, FA correlated significantly with Mullen EL and RL raw scores, but not ADOS severity score, along the left and right ILF. Subgroups also differed in MD (but not FA) along the left superior longitudinal fasiculus and left corticospinal tract, but these differences were not correlated with language scores. These findings suggest that white matter microstructure in the left and right ILF varies in relation to lexical development in young males with ASD.

"Researchers have recently hypothesized that autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may be partly characterized by physiological over-arousal. One way to assess physiological arousal is through autonomic measures. Here heart period (HP) and parasympathetic activity measured by respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) were examined in adults with ASD and matched controls at rest and during performance of an emotional Stroop task. Resting HP and RSA were lower in adults with ASD than in matched controls, consistent with hypothesized over-arousal in ASD. However, dividing the ASD group on the basis of antipsychotic medication usage revealed that group differences in autonomic arousal may be related to the effects of these medications or their correlates. Autonomic adjustments for Stroop performance were comparable across groups, but in the control group, larger RSA reductions were correlated with faster responding (i.e., better performance). This relation was reversed in the unmedicated ASD group and absent in the medicated ASD group. Findings highlight the importance of considering medication status in the recently burgeoning area of psychophysiological studies of autism.",Researchers have recently hypothesized that autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may be partly characterized by physiological over-arousal.

"Although individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have impaired responses to interpersonal touch, the underlying neural correlates remain largely unknown. Here, we examined the neural correlates that underlie interpersonal touch perception in individuals with either high or low autistic traits. Fifty-three participants were classified as having either high or low autistic traits based on their performance on the autism quotient (AQ) questionnaire. We hypothesized that individuals with high AQ scores would have relatively high touch hypervigilance, reflected as earlier P1 and stronger late positive potential (LPP) responses, two components of event-related potentials that serve as electrophysiological markers of anxiety bias. We recorded each participant's electroencephalography activity during presentation of images depicting human touch, object touch, and non-touch control images. Consistent with our hypothesis, AQ scores were positively correlated with social touch aversion. Moreover, participants with high AQ scores had earlier P1 and stronger LPP responses when presented with human touch compared to the control images. Importantly, a regression model revealed that earlier P1 and larger LPP amplitude measured during social touch observation can accurately predict higher autistic trait levels. Taken together, these findings indicate that individuals with high levels of autistic traits may have a hypervigilant response to observed social touch.

"This study explored the relationships between the later age of achievement of early motor milestones, current motor atypicalities (toe walking), and the severity of restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Parents of 147 children and adolescents with ASD (M<sub>age</sub> &#x2009;=&#x2009;8.09 years, SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.28; 119 males) completed an early developmental milestones questionnaire and the Social Responsiveness Scale as a measure of Insistence on Sameness (IS) and Repetitive Mannerisms (RM). Two hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to test whether RM and IS behaviors were predicted by early motor milestones, or current toe walking. The final model predicting RM accounted for 15% of the variance (F&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.02, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.009), with toe walking as a unique and independent predictor of RM scores (t&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.568, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.001). The final model predicting IS accounted for 19.1% of variance in IS scores (F&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.045, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.001), with chronological age (CA) (t&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.92, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.004), age when first standing (t&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.09, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.038), and toe walking (t&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.53, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;.013) as unique independent predictors.

"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is recognized as a global public health concern, yet almost everything we know about ASD comes from high-income countries. Here we performed a scoping review of all research on ASD ever published in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in order to identify ASD knowledge gaps in this part of the world. Fifty-three publications met inclusion criteria. Themes included the phenotype, genetics and risk factors for ASD in SSA, screening and diagnosis, professional knowledge, interventions for ASD, parental perceptions, and social-cognitive neuroscience. No epidemiological, early intervention, school-based or adult studies were identified. For each identified theme, we aimed to summarize results and make recommendations to fill the knowledge gaps. The quality of study methodologies was generally not high. Few studies used standardized diagnostic instruments, and intervention studies were typically small-scale. Overall, findings suggest a substantial need for large-scale clinical, training, and research programmes to improve the lives of people who live with ASD in SSA. However, SSA also has the potential to make unique and globally-significant contributions to the etiology and treatments of ASD through implementation, interventional, and comparative genomic science.

"The aim of this study was to classify children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) according to Autism Classification System of Functioning: Social Communication (ACSF:SC) criteria, in order to investigate the association between social communication ability, ASD severity, adaptive functioning, cognitive abilities and psychoeducational profile. The severity of social communication impairment was specified through Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5th edition (DSM-5) and ACSF:SC tool.

"Caring for a child with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been linked to a range of negative outcomes for parents but less is known about the putative impact upon the parental couple relationship. The relationship satisfaction of parents of children with ASD was investigated using multilevel modeling. Mothers and fathers (146 couples) reported on their relationship satisfaction, their own well-being, and the behavior problems of the child with ASD and a sibling. Results indicated that mothers and fathers reported similar levels of relationship satisfaction and it was significantly and negatively associated with parental depression and the behavior problems of the child with ASD. Relationship satisfaction was unrelated to the behavior problems of a sibling, the number of children in the household, and family socioeconomic position (SEP). Further longitudinal research that captures a broader range of variables is required to build a theoretical understanding of relationship satisfaction in families of children with ASD.

"Pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is the most common and least satisfactory of the PDD diagnoses. It is not formally operationalized, which limits its reliability and has hampered attempts to assess its validity. We aimed, first, to improve the reliability and replicability of PDD-NOS by operationalizing its DSM-IV-TR description and, second, to test its validity through comparison with autistic disorder (AD) and Asperger's disorder (AsD). In a sample of 256 young people (mean age = 9.1 years) we used Developmental, Diagnostic and Dimensional (3Di) algorithmic analysis to classify DSM-IV-TR AD (n = 97), AsD (n = 93) and PDD-NOS (n = 66). Groups were compared on independent measures of core PDD symptomatology, associated autistic features, and intelligence. Contrary to the assumption that PDD-NOS is heterogeneous, almost all (97%) of those with PDD-NOS had one distinct symptom pattern, namely impairments in social reciprocity and communication, without significant repetitive and stereotyped behaviors (RSB). Compared to AD and AsD, they had comparably severe but more circumscribed social communication difficulties, with fewer non-social features of autism, such as sensory, feeding and visuo-spatial problems. These individuals appear to have a distinct variant of autism that does not merely sit at the less severe end of the same continuum of symptoms. The current draft guidelines for DSM-V, which mandate the presence of RSBs for any PDD diagnosis, would exclude such people from the autistic spectrum.","Pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is the most common and least satisfactory of the PDD diagnoses.

"Previous neuroimaging research has reported increased internal (neural) noise in sensory systems of autistic individuals. However, it is unclear if this difference has behavioural or perceptual consequences, as previous attempts at measuring internal noise in ASD psychophysically have been indirect.

We tracked eye gaze and behavioral performance in two task conditions: one with and one without local interference from background noise elements. While analyses revealed lower accuracy and longer reaction time in ASD in the condition with local interference only, eye tracking robustly captured ASD-related global atypicalities across both conditions. Specifically, relative to controls, children with ASD showed decreased fixations to KIC centers, indicating reduced global perception. Notably, they did not differ from controls in regard to fixations to local elements or touch response location.

"This study examined whether individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) produce co-speech gestures similarly to typically developing (TD) peers. Participants were 20 youth ages 10-18 years with high-functioning ASD and 21 TD controls matched on age, gender, verbal IQ, and handedness. Gestures were elicited using a classic narrative-retelling task, in which participants watched a Tweety and Sylvester cartoon and retold the cartoon to a confederate. Analyses compared gesture rate, type, and viewpoint (character, observer, dual) across groups. Communicative utility of gestures was measured via na&#xef;ve coder ratings of whether a movement was a gesture, and the clarity of a gesture's meaning. The ASD group produced shorter narratives and fewer total gestures than the TD group. Accounting for narrative length, the ASD group produced fewer gestures per clause than the TD group; however, proportions of gesture types (iconic, deictic, beat, metaphoric, emblems) did not differ. Most notably, the ASD group's gestures were rated as less clearly gestures in terms of timing and well formedness, with lower certainty ratings for gesture meaning. Gesture clarity and gesture meaning scores were related to diagnostic measures of gesture competence in ASD. Findings suggest that although fluent children and adolescents with ASD use the same type of gestures as controls, their gestures are more difficult to understand, which has significant implications for their communicative abilities more broadly.

"People with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) process visual information in a manner that is distinct from typically developing individuals. They may be less sensitive to people's goals and, more generally, focus on visual details instead of the entire scene. To examine these differences, people with and without ASD were asked to detect changes in dynamic scenes with multiple elements. Participants viewed a brief video of a person or an inanimate object (the ""figure"") moving from one object to another; after a delay, they reported whether a second video was the same or different. Possible changes included the figure, the object the figure was moving from, or the object the figure was moving toward (the ""goal""). We hypothesized that individuals with ASD would be less sensitive to changes in scenes with people, particularly elements that might be the person's goal. Alternately, people with ASD might attend to fewer elements regardless of whether the scene included a person. Our results indicate that, like controls, people with ASD noticed a change in the ""goal"" object at the end of a person's movement more often than the object at the start. However, the group with ASD did not undergo the developmental improvement that was evident typically when detecting changes in both the start and end objects. This atypical development led to deficits in adults with ASD that were not specific to scenes with people or to ""goals."" Improvements in visual processing that underlie mature representation of scenes may not occur in ASD, suggesting that late developing brain processes are affected.","People with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) process visual information in a manner that is distinct from typically developing individuals.

"One of the earliest observable impairments in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a failure to orient to speech and other social stimuli. Auditory spatial attention, a key component of orienting to sounds in the environment, has been shown to be impaired in adults with ASD. Additionally, specific deficits in orienting to social sounds could be related to increased acoustic complexity of speech. We aimed to characterize auditory spatial attention in children with ASD and neurotypical controls, and to determine the effect of auditory stimulus complexity on spatial attention. In a spatial attention task, target and distractor sounds were played randomly in rapid succession from speakers in a free-field array. Participants attended to a central or peripheral location, and were instructed to respond to target sounds at the attended location while ignoring nearby sounds. Stimulus-specific blocks evaluated spatial attention for simple non-speech tones, speech sounds (vowels), and complex non-speech sounds matched to vowels on key acoustic properties. Children with ASD had significantly more diffuse auditory spatial attention than neurotypical children when attending front, indicated by increased responding to sounds at adjacent non-target locations. No significant differences in spatial attention emerged based on stimulus complexity.

"Approximately 30% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have elevated whole blood serotonin (5-HT) levels. Genetic linkage and association studies of ASD and of whole blood 5-HT levels as a quantitative trait have revealed sexual dimorphism. Few studies have examined the presence of a sex difference on hyperserotonemia within ASD. To assess whether the rate of hyperserotonemia is different in males than in females with ASD, we measured whole blood 5-HT levels in 292 children and adolescents with ASD, the largest sample in which this biomarker has been assessed. Based upon previous work suggesting that hyperserotonemia is more common prior to puberty, we focused our analysis on the 182 pre-pubertal children with ASD. 42% of pre-pubertal participants were within the hyperserotonemia range. In this population, we found that males were significantly more likely to manifest hyperserotonemia than females (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03). As expected, no significant difference was found in the post-pubertal population. Additional work will be needed to replicate this intriguing finding and to understand whether it could potentially explain differences in patterns of ASD risk between males and females.

"Studying cognitive and affective mechanisms of social behavior could lead to identifying early indicators of derailing social behavior in young children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The present study combined sensitive and objective techniques, such as eyetracking and psychophysiology, to provide insight into early neurodevelopmental mechanisms that are more difficult to uncover when relying on behavioral measures. Social attention towards faces and changes in affective arousal were investigated together in 28 young children with ASD (42-75 months) and 45 nonclinical controls (41-81 months). Children were shown a social-emotional video clip while eyetracking and heart rate were measured. Children with ASD fixated less on key social-emotional features within the clip as compared to controls, even though both groups attended equally toward the screen. In contrast to the control group, children with ASD did not show an increase or modulation in affective arousal in response to the social-emotional scenes. Severity of ASD symptoms, specifically social problems, was associated with arousal modulation and social attention within the ASD group. Early ASD symptoms are associated with impairments in fundamental building blocks of social behavior as expressed in a lack in spontaneous social attention and affective arousal. Such sensitive and objective measures of underlying mechanisms might serve as indicators for tailored approaches in treatment and may help in evaluating effectiveness of early interventions aimed at positively influencing social development and related quality of life in individuals with ASD.

"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently co-occurs with intellectual disability (ID) and often remains undiagnosed until adulthood. The Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) is a widely used measure to screen for ASD. To improve the utility of the SCQ for adults with ID, the aim of this study was to develop an ID-specific and adult appropriate algorithm for the SCQ using a core set of valid items. These items were identified in one sample (N = 226) and further cross-validated in a second, independent sample (N = 225) from Germany, England and the U.S. The newly developed algorithm has 24 items compared with the 40 items in the original instrument. The reduced item core set yielded similar diagnostic validity as the original algorithm with good sensitivity values (0.81-0.89) and low specificity values (0.62-0.72). Overall, these results suggest that the removed items may not carry diagnostically relevant information in adults with ID; thus, excluding these items may result in a more efficient and age-appropriate screening measure for this population. However, due to the low specificity values, a comprehensive assessment is essential for a final diagnostic assignment.

"Because animal and human studies indicate that androgen exposure can influence neurodevelopment, it has been hypothesized that prenatal exposure to excess androgens may predispose to disorders with male-skewed ratio such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Therefore, maternal conditions characterized by hyperandrogenism such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or hirsutism may be relevant to child ASD. We previously found in a large Swedish case-control study of 23,748 ASD cases and 208,796 matched controls that PCOS in mothers is associated with increased offspring risk of ASD. In the same sample, we have now examined whether maternal diagnoses of hirsutism were associated with ASD. In both unadjusted logistic regression models and models adjusted for a variety of covariates, hirsutism was associated with higher odds of ASD. The most adjusted odds ratios for associations with ASD for hirsutism diagnosis before birth and lifetime diagnosis of hirsutism were 1.64 (95% CI: 0.94, 2.83) and 1.26 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.57), respectively.

"Caregiver report is the most common measure of change in pediatric psychiatry. Yet, placebo response rates pose significant challenges to reliably detect a treatment response. The present study simulated an eight-week clinical trial protocol for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) for the purpose of testing the feasibility and validity of several outcome measures. Twenty caregivers answered questions about their child's behavior on their smartphone each week and completed a battery of paper questionnaires during weeks one and eight. No treatment was administered. Caregivers reported a significant decrease in problem behaviors on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) (29% decrease) and general ASD behaviors on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (7% decrease). There was also a trend of behavior improvement from smartphone questions but no significant changes in clinical ratings of core diagnostic features of ASD. Participation in a comprehensive protocol in the absence of a particular treatment significantly influenced how caregivers perceived the severity of their children's problem behaviors.

"Elevated whole blood serotonin 5-HT, or hyperserotonemia, is a common biomarker in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The integrin &#x3b2;3 receptor subunit gene (ITGB3) is a quantitative trait locus for whole blood 5-HT levels. Recent work shows that integrin &#x3b2;3 interacts with the serotonin transporter (SERT) in both platelets and in the midbrain. Furthermore, multiple studies have now reported gene-gene interaction between the integrin &#x3b2;3 and SERT genes in association with ASD. Given the lack of previous data on the impact of integrin &#x3b2;3 on brain or behavioral phenotypes, we sought to compare mice with decreased or absent expression of the integrin &#x3b2;3 receptor subunit (Itgb3 +/- and -/-) with wildtype littermate controls in behavioral tasks relevant to ASD. These mice did not show deficits in activity level in the open field or anxiety-like behavior on the elevated plus maze, two potential confounds in the evaluation of mouse social behavior. In the three-chamber social test, mice lacking integrin &#x3b2;3 were shown to have normal sociability but did not show a preference for social novelty. Importantly, the absence of integrin &#x3b2;3 did not impair olfaction or the ability to recall familiar social odors. Additionally, mice lacking integrin &#x3b2;3 showed increased grooming behavior in novel environments. These preliminary studies reveal altered social and repetitive behavior in these mice, which suggests that the integrin &#x3b2;3 subunit may be involved in brain systems relevant to ASD. Further work is needed to fully characterize these behavioral changes and the underlying brain mechanisms.","Elevated whole blood serotonin 5-HT, or hyperserotonemia, is a common biomarker in autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

"We examined whether reduced perceptual specialization underlies atypical perception in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) testing classifications of stimuli that differ either along integral dimensions (prototypical integral dimensions of value and chroma), or along separable dimensions (prototypical separable dimensions of value and size). Current models of the perception of individuals with an ASD would suggest that on these tasks, individuals with ASD would be as, or more, likely to process dimensions as separable, regardless of whether they represented separable or integrated dimensions. In contrast, reduced specialization would propose that individuals with ASD would respond in a more integral manner to stimuli that differ along separable dimensions, and at the same time, respond in a more separable manner to stimuli that differ along integral dimensions. A group of nineteen adults diagnosed with high functioning ASD and seventeen typically developing participants of similar age and IQ, were tested on speeded and restricted classifications tasks. Consistent with the reduced specialization account, results show that individuals with ASD do not always respond more analytically than typically developed (TD) observers: Dimensions identified as integral for TD individuals evoke less integral responding in individuals with ASD, while those identified as separable evoke less analytic responding.

"It has been suggested that people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have an increased tendency to use explicit (or intentional) learning strategies. This altered learning may play a role in the development of the social communication difficulties characterizing ASD. In the current study, we investigated incidental and intentional sequence learning using a Serial Reaction Time (SRT) task in an adult ASD population. Response times and event related potentials (ERP) components (N2b and P3) were assessed as indicators of learning and knowledge. Findings showed that behaviorally, sequence learning and ensuing explicit knowledge were similar in ASD and typically developing (TD) controls. However, ERP findings showed that learning in the TD group was characterized by an enhanced N2b, while learning in the ASD group was characterized by an enhanced P3. These findings suggest that learning in the TD group might be more incidental in nature, whereas learning in the ASD group is more intentional or effortful. Increased intentional learning might serve as a strategy for individuals with ASD to control an overwhelming environment. Although this led to similar behavioral performances on the SRT task, it is very plausible that this intentional learning has adverse effects in more complex social situations, and hence contributes to the social impairments found in ASD.

"Proteomics, the large-scale study of protein expression in cells and tissues, is a powerful tool to study the biology of clinical conditions and has provided significant insights in many experimental systems. Herein, we review the basics of proteomic methodology and discuss challenges in using proteomic approaches to study autism. Unlike other experimental approaches, such as genomic approaches, there have been few large-scale studies of proteins in tissues from persons with autism. Most of the proteomic studies on autism used blood or other peripheral tissues; few studies used brain tissue. Some studies found dysregulation of aspects of the immune system or of aspects of lipid metabolism, but no consistent findings were noted. Based on the challenges in using proteomics to study autism, we discuss considerations for future studies. Apart from the complex technical considerations implicit in any proteomic analysis, key nontechnical matters include attention to subject and specimen inclusion/exclusion criteria, having adequate sample size to ensure appropriate powering of the study, attention to the state of specimens prior to proteomic analysis, and the use of a replicate set of specimens, when possible. We conclude by discussing some potentially productive uses of proteomics, potentially coupled with other approaches, for future autism research including: (1) proteomic analysis of banked human brain specimens; (2) proteomic analysis of tissues from animal models of autism; and (3) proteomic analysis of induced pluripotent stem cells that are differentiated into various types of brain cells and neural organoids.

We conclude by discussing some potentially productive uses of proteomics, potentially coupled with other approaches, for future autism research including: (1) proteomic analysis of banked human brain specimens; (2) proteomic analysis of tissues from animal models of autism; and (3) proteomic analysis of induced pluripotent stem cells that are differentiated into various types of brain cells and neural organoids.",1,1,0,"Based on the challenges in using proteomics to study autism, we discuss considerations for future studies.

"Girls and women in the general population present with a distinct profile of clinical needs and use more associated health services compared to boys and men; however, research focused on health service use patterns among girls and women with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is limited. In the current study, caregivers of 61 adolescent girls and women with ASD and 223 boys and men with ASD completed an online survey. Descriptive analyses were conducted to better understand the clinical needs and associated service use patterns of girls and women with ASD. Sex/gender comparisons were made of individuals' clinical needs and service use. Adolescent girls and women with ASD had prevalent co-occurring mental and physical conditions and parents reported elevated levels of caregiver strain. Multiple service use was common across age groups, particularly among adolescent girls and women with intellectual disability. Overall, few sex/gender differences emerged, although a significantly greater proportion of girls and women accessed psychiatry and emergency department services as compared to boys and men. Though the current study is limited by its use of parent report and small sample size, it suggests that girls and women with ASD may share many of the same high clinical needs and patterns of services use as boys and men with ASD.

"Impairments in social interaction and communicating with others are core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the specific processes underlying such social competence impairments are not well understood. An important key for increasing our understanding of ASD-specific social deficits may lie with the social motor synchronization that takes place when we implicitly coordinate our bodies with others. Here, we tested whether dynamical measures of synchronization differentiate children with ASD from controls and further explored the relationships between synchronization ability and motor control problems. We found (a) that children with ASD exhibited different and less stable patterns of social synchronization ability than controls; (b) children with ASD performed motor movements that were slower and more variable in both spacing and timing; and (c) some social synchronization that involved motor timing was related to motor ability but less rhythmic synchronization was not. These findings raise the possibility that objective dynamical measures of synchronization ability and motor skill could provide new insights into understanding the social deficits in ASD that could ultimately aid clinical diagnosis and prognosis.

"The Social Responsiveness Scale [SRS; Constantino &amp; Gruber, 2005] is a widely-used measure of autism symptoms, but its application for the study of adults with autism spectrum disorders has not been fully evaluated. Using a factor structure consistent with The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed., DSM-V) criteria for autism spectrum disorder [Frazier et al., 2014], the primary purpose of the current study was to establish the validity of the SRS with a sample of adults with autism spectrum disorder (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;237). Correlational analyses indicated that SRS factors were highly associated with autism symptoms and behavioral measures, indicating concurrent and predictive validity.

"To evaluate the efficacy of the Social ABCs parent-mediated intervention for toddlers with suspected or confirmed autism spectrum disorder (ASD), through a cross-site randomized control trial, sixty-three parent-toddler dyads (toddler age: 16-30 months) were randomized into treatment (Social ABCs) or control (service-as-usual) conditions.

"The purpose of this study is to examine the phonological and other vocal productions of children, 18-36 months, with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and to compare these productions to those of age-matched and language-matched controls. Speech samples were obtained from 30 toddlers with ASD, 11 age-matched toddlers and 23 language-matched toddlers during either parent-child or clinician-child play sessions. Samples were coded for a variety of speech-like and nonspeech vocalization productions. Toddlers with ASD produced speech-like vocalizations similar to those of language-matched peers, but produced significantly more atypical nonspeech vocalizations when compared to both control groups. Toddlers with ASD show speech-like sound production that is linked to their language level, in a manner similar to that seen in typical development. The main area of difference in vocal development in this population is in the production of atypical vocalizations. Findings suggest that toddlers with ASDs do not tune into the language model of their environment. Failure to attend to the ambient language environment negatively impacts the ability to acquire spoken language.","The purpose of this study is to examine the phonological and other vocal productions of children, 18-36 months, with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and to compare these productions to those of age-matched and language-matched controls.","Speech samples were obtained from 30 toddlers with ASD, 11 age-matched toddlers and 23 language-matched toddlers during either parent-child or clinician-child play sessions.

"Structural and sequence variation have been described in several members of the contactin (CNTN) and contactin-associated protein (CNTNAP) gene families in association with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism. Using array comparative genome hybridization (CGH), we identified a maternally inherited &#x223c;535&#x2009;kb deletion at 3p26.3 encompassing the 5' end of the contactin 4 gene (CNTN4) in a patient with autism. Based on this finding and previous reports implicating genomic rearrangements of CNTN4 in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and 3p- microdeletion syndrome, we undertook sequencing of the coding regions of the gene in a local ASD cohort in comparison with a set of controls. Unique missense variants were identified in 4 of 75 unrelated individuals with ASD, as well as in 1 of 107 controls. All of the amino acid substitutions were nonsynonomous, occurred at evolutionarily conserved positions, and were, thus, felt likely to be deleterious. However, these data did not reach statistical significance, nor did the variants segregate with disease within all of the ASD families. Finally, there was no detectable difference in binding of two of the variants to the interacting protein PTPRG in vitro. Thus, additional larger studies will be necessary to determine whether CNTN4 functions as an autism susceptibility locus in combination with other genetic and/or environmental factors.","Structural and sequence variation have been described in several members of the contactin (CNTN) and contactin-associated protein (CNTNAP) gene families in association with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism.

"Autism is a neuro-developmental disorder characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication as well as restricted interests or repetitive behaviors. Cytogenetic studies have implicated large chromosomal aberrations in the etiology of approximately 5-7% of autism patients, and the recent advent of array-based techniques allows the exploration of submicroscopic copy number variations (CNVs). We genotyped a 14-year-old boy with autism, spherocytosis and other physical dysmorphia, his parents, and two non-autistic siblings with the Illumina Human 1M Beadchip as part of a study of the molecular genetics of autism and determined copy number variants using the PennCNV algorithm. We identified and validated a de novo 1.5&#x2009;Mb microdeletion of 14q23.2-23.3 in our autistic patient. This region contains 15 genes, including spectrin beta (SPTB), encoding a cytoskeletal protein previously associated with spherocytosis, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 (MTHFD1), a folate metabolizing enzyme previously associated with bipoloar disorder and schizophrenia, pleckstrin homology domain-containing family G member 3 (PLEKHG3), a guanide nucleotide exchange enriched in the brain, and churchill domain containing protein 1 (CHURC1), homologs of which regulate neuronal development in model organisms. While a similar deletion has previously been reported in a family with spherocytosis, severe learning disabilities, and mild mental retardation, this is the first implication of chr14q23.2-23.3 in the etiology of autism and points to MTHFD1, PLEKHG3, and CHURC1 as potential candidate genes contributing to autism risk.","Autism is a neuro-developmental disorder characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication as well as restricted interests or repetitive behaviors.

"About 80% of cases with autism express intellectual disability. Both in autism and in mental retardation without autism the majority of the cases are males, suggesting a X-chromosomal effect. In fact, some molecular evidence has been obtained for a common genetic background for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). In several genome-wide scans (GWS), evidence for linkage at X-chromosome has been reported including the GWS of Finnish ASD families with the highest multipoint lod score (MLS) of 2.75 obtained close to DXS7132 at Xq11.1. To further dissect the relationship between autism and genes implicated in XLMR, we have fine-mapped Xq11.1-q21.33 and analyzed five candidate genes in the region. We refined the region using 26 microsatellite markers and linkage analysis in 99 Finnish families with ASD. The most significant evidence for linkage was observed at DXS1225 on Xq21.1 with a nonparametric multipoint NPL(all) value of 3.43 (P = 0.0004). We sequenced the coding regions and splice sites of RPS6KA6 and ZNF711 residing at the peak region in 42 male patients from families contributing to the linkage. We also analyzed ACSL4 and DLG3, which have previously been known to cause XLMR and IL1RAPL2, a homologous gene for IL1RAPL1 that is mutated in autism and XLMR. A total of six novel and 11 known single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified.

"Autism is a developmental disorder with prenatal origins, currently estimated to affect 1 in 91 children in the United States. Social-emotional deficits are a hallmark of autism and early neuropathology studies have indicated involvement of the limbic system. Imaging studies demonstrate abnormal activation of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a component of the limbic system. Abnormal activation has also been noted in the fusiform gyrus (FFG), a region important for facial recognition and a key element in social interaction. A potential imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in the cortex may contribute to altered information processing in autism. Furthermore, reduced numbers of GABA receptors have previously been reported in the autistic brain. Thionin-stained sections were used to qualitatively assess cytoarchitectonic patterning and quantitatively determine the density of neurons and immunohistochemistry was used to determine the densities of a subset of GABAergic interneurons utilizing parvalbumin-and calbindin-immunoreactivity. In autism, the PCC displayed altered cytoarchitecture with irregularly distributed neurons, poorly demarcated layers IV and V, and increased presence of white matter neurons. In contrast, no neuropathology was observed in the FFG. There was no significant difference in the density of thionin, parvalbumin, or calbindin interneurons in either region and there was a trend towards a reduced density of calbindin neurons in the PCC. This study highlights the presence of abnormal findings in the PCC, which appear to be developmental in nature and could affect the local processing of social-emotional behaviors as well as functioning of interrelated areas.","Autism is a developmental disorder with prenatal origins, currently estimated to affect 1 in 91 children in the United States.

"Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are often reported to be good at detecting minute changes in the environment. This study tested two factors in this phenomenon; detail-focus and reduced top-down influence of scene-schema expectations on spontaneous attention to visual scene elements. Using a change blindness paradigm, adults with ASD and matched typically developing (TD) adults were presented with images of naturalistic scenes (e.g., living room). Scene changes involved three types of object substitution: an object was replaced with (i) an unexpected scene-unrelated object, (ii) a scene-related object of a different basic-level category, (iii) or a different exemplar of the original object category. Top-down effects of scene-schema expectations should render scene-unrelated (i) substitutions easiest to recognize; detail focus should increase detection of exemplar changes. The TD group showed the expected condition effects, detecting scene-unrelated substitutions significantly better than both types of scene-related changes. By contrast, the ASD group showed no condition effect, and was only significantly slower and less accurate than the TD group in detecting scene-unrelated objects. These findings suggest reduced influence of schematic expectations on spontaneous attention in individuals with ASD. Together with other factors, this may contribute to the tendency to notice ""irrelevant"" changes in the environment.",Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are often reported to be good at detecting minute changes in the environment.

"We report that a significant number of autistic children have serum levels of IgA antibodies above normal to the enzyme tissue transglutaminase II (TG2), and that expression of these antibodies to TG2 is linked to the (HLA)-DR3, DQ2 and DR7, DQ2 haplotypes. TG2 is expressed in the brain, where it has been shown to be important in cell adhesion and synaptic stabilization. Thus, these children appear to constitute a subpopulation of autistic children who fall within the autism disease spectrum, and for whom autoimmunity may represent a significant etiological component of their autism.","TG2 is expressed in the brain, where it has been shown to be important in cell adhesion and synaptic stabilization.","We report that a significant number of autistic children have serum levels of IgA antibodies above normal to the enzyme tissue transglutaminase II (TG2), and that expression of these antibodies to TG2 is linked to the (HLA)-DR3, DQ2 and DR7, DQ2 haplotypes.","Thus, these children appear to constitute a subpopulation of autistic children who fall within the autism disease spectrum, and for whom autoimmunity may represent a significant etiological component of their autism.",1,1,1,"Thus, these children appear to constitute a subpopulation of autistic children who fall within the autism disease spectrum, and for whom environmental factors may represent a significant etiological component of their autism."
"Finding predisposition genes for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has proven challenging, and new methods are needed to aid the process. Using pedigree structure as a strategy to identify ASD predisposition genes, we previously performed a genome-wide linkage scan of 86 selected families from the Autism Resource Exchange (AGRE) that appeared to inherit ASD in a dominant manner. We identified a suggestive linkage peak on chromosome Xp22.11-p21.2 that encompasses the IL1RAPL1 gene, a strong candidate gene for ASD. In this follow-up study, we sequenced the coding regions of the IL1RAPL1 gene in 14 male cases representing one case from each pedigree that showed at least nominal linkage evidence on per pedigree basis to the chromosome X region. We observed no deleterious mutations or deletions in the IL1RAPL1 gene in these 14 ASD cases. A SNP was identified in exon 2 in five cases and a variant of unknown significance was identified in intron 6 in a single case. In conclusion, coding changes of the IL1RAPL1 gene do not appear to be associated with ASD in selected AGRE families with linkage evidence to the chromosome Xp22.11-p21.2 region.","Finding predisposition genes for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has proven challenging, and new methods are needed to aid the process.

"The present study examined the link between poor self-regulation (measured by the child behavior checklist dysregulated profile [DP]) and core autism symptoms, as well as with developmental level, in a sample of 107 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) aged 19-46 months. We further examined the utility of DP in predicting individual differences in adaptive functioning, relative to the influence of ASD severity, chronological age (CA), and developmental level. Poor self-regulation was unrelated to CA, developmental level, and severity of ADOS-2 restricted and repetitive behaviors, but was associated with lower ADOS-2 social affect severity. Hierarchical regression identified poor self-regulation as a unique independent predictor of adaptive behavior, with more severe dysregulation predicting poorer adaptive functioning. Results highlight the importance of early identification of deficits in self-regulation, and more specifically, of the utility of DP, when designing individually tailored treatments for young children with ASD.

"Autism is a pervasive, heterogeneous, neurodevelopmental disability characterized by impairments in verbal communications, reciprocal social interactions, and restricted repetitive stereotyped behaviors. Evidence suggests the involvement of multiple genetic factors in the etiology of autism, and extensive genome-wide association studies have revealed several candidate genes that bear single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in non-coding and coding regions. We have shown that a non-conservative, non-synonymous SNP in the glyoxalase I gene, GLOI, may be an autism susceptibility factor. The GLOI rs2736654 SNP is a C&#x2192;A change that causes an Ala111Glu change in the Glo1 enzyme. To identify the significance of the SNP, we have conducted functional assays for Glo1. We now present evidence that the presence of the A-allele at rs2736654 results in reduced enzyme activity. Glo1 activity is decreased in lymphoblastoid cells that are homozygous for the A allele. The Glu-isoform of Glo1 in these cells is hyperphosphorylated. Direct HPLC measurements of the glyoxalase I substrate, methylglyoxal (MG), show an increase in MG in these cells. Western blot analysis revealed elevated levels of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGEs). We also show that MG is toxic to the developing neuronal cells. We suggest that accumulation of MG results in the formation of AGEs, which induce expression of the RAGE that during crucial neuronal development may be a factor in the pathology of autism.","Autism is a pervasive, heterogeneous, neurodevelopmental disability characterized by impairments in verbal communications, reciprocal social interactions, and restricted repetitive stereotyped behaviors.

"Social difficulties of autistic individuals have been suggested to be caused by mind blindness, the absence of a theory of mind. Numerous studies have investigated theory of mind in autism spectrum disorder or how autistic individuals represent the mental states of others. Here, we have examined, as an alternative, mind perception, namely how individuals perceive the minds of various animate and inanimate entities. Autistic and non-autistic participants demonstrated evidence of a similar two-dimensional mind perception; agency, capacity for doing (i.e., self-control, memory, plan), and experience, capacity for feeling (i.e., fear, hunger, pain). Some targets (e.g., human infant and dog) were perceived to have low agency but high experience, while others (e.g., robot and God) were perceived to have the reverse pattern. Moreover, in both autistic and non-autistic groups, the attribution of moral blame positively correlated with agency, whereas moral consideration positively correlated with experience. These results offer new evidence of social cognition, particularly conception of mind and morality, in autism.

"Although most research on autistic behavior has considered autism categorically, the increasingly apparent genetic and phenotypic complexities of autism are prompting a more dimensional approach to this area. The long-standing interest in a less categorical approach is made clear from a review of literature. The accumulating empirical support for viewing autism-related phenomena as separable and fractionable is outlined and includes data indicating that many of the behaviors occur in isolation in family members and the general population, are not highly correlated within individuals, and appear to be inherited separately. However, it is emphasized that some of the most common and characteristic phenomena observed in individuals diagnosed with autism do not run in their families. It is suggested that these novel, ""emergent,"" phenomena may arise in the individual from interacting configurations of co-occurring traits or from the interaction of genetic and biological factors underlying the traits. A number of autism-related phenomena including intellectual disability, seizures, persistence of primitive reflexes, stereotypies, self-injurious behavior, savant abilities, and morphological abnormalities, among others, are discussed as potentially being emergent. It is concluded that consideration of the role of emergence in autistic behavior and related phenomena should complement a reductionist approach and might help illuminate the components and complexities of autism.","Although most research on autistic behavior has considered autism categorically, the increasingly apparent genetic and phenotypic complexities of autism are prompting a more dimensional approach to this area.

"Recent developments in the science of autism have provoked widespread unease among autism activists. Drawing on the findings of a major international gathering of researchers, ethicists, and activists, this paper presents the first major analysis of the ethical questions arising from this unease. We outline the scientific developments that have provoked the most discomfort, analyze the response to these developments from within and without the autism community, and trace the current state of the ethical debate. Having done so, we contend that these ethical questions are unlikely to be resolved as they depend on fundamentally conflicting assumptions about the nature and desirability of neurocognitive difference. We conclude by arguing for a new range of democratic mechanisms that could enable the scientific community, autistics, and other concerned parties to respond collectively to such entrenched ethical disputes.","Recent developments in the science of autism have provoked widespread unease among autism activists.

"This study further investigates findings of impairment in Gestalt, but not global processing in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) [Brosnan, Scott, Fox, &amp; Pye, 2004]. Nineteen males with ASD and nineteen typically developing (TD) males matched by nonverbal ability, took part in five Gestalt perceptual grouping tasks. Results showed that performance differed according to grouping type. The ASD group showed typical performance for grouping by proximity and by alignment, impairment on low difficulty trials for orientation and luminance similarity, and general impairment for grouping by shape similarity. Group differences were also observed developmentally; for the ASD group, with the exception of grouping by shape similarity, perceptual grouping performance was poorer at lower than higher levels of nonverbal ability. In contrast, no developmental progression was observed in the TD controls.","This study further investigates findings of impairment in Gestalt, but not global processing in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) [Brosnan, Scott, Fox, & Pye, 2004].","Nineteen males with ASD and nineteen typically developing (TD) males matched by nonverbal ability, took part in five Gestalt perceptual grouping tasks.","Results showed that performance differed according to grouping type.

"Previous research indicates that individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) do not develop face expertise to the same extent as typical individuals. Yet it remains unclear whether this atypicality is specific to faces or related to more pervasive perceptual or cognitive deficits involved in the actual process of gaining expertise. To address this question, we examined the extent to which adults with ASC were capable of developing expertise with non-face objects. To become experts, all participants completed a 2-week training program with novel objects, known as Greebles. Level of expertise was assessed throughout training by measuring the ability to identify Greebles on an individual level. The perceptual strategies acquired as a result of expertise were measured through an inversion effect task completed before and after training, in which performance with upright Greebles and faces was compared to performance with inverted Greebles and faces. After expertise training, it was found that individuals in both the ASC and the typical group successfully achieved expertise and showed an enhanced Greeble inversion effect as a result of training. The development of an inversion effect with Greebles suggests that individuals with ASC may employ the same processing strategies as the typical group. Although exploratory, these findings have implications for understanding the nature of the face processing deficit in ASC as well as offering potential insights into face processing interventions for individuals with ASC.",Previous research indicates that individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) do not develop face expertise to the same extent as typical individuals.

"Anxiety is common among people with autism and is associated with unique and additive challenges. Anxiety is thought to have neurobiological components, and measures of arousal in typical development have long been studied. Recently, neurobiological measures of anxiety in autism have begun to receive empirical evaluation, but results have not yet been examined together. This systematic review, therefore, summarizes the state of the research of the neurobiology of anxiety in autism. Studies published between 1999 and June 2017 were reviewed. Results across measures of arousal point to inconsistencies in results and a lack of synthesis in the literature. Considerations regarding these inconsistencies are discussed, recommendations for future studies are offered, and clinical implications for this work are presented.

Studies published between 1999 and June 2017 were reviewed.","Results across measures of arousal point to inconsistencies in results and a lack of synthesis in the literature. Considerations regarding these inconsistencies are discussed, recommendations for future studies are offered, and clinical implications for this work are presented.",1,1,1,"Results across measures of arousal point to consistencies in results and a lack of synthesis in the literature.

"Autism is a childhood neuropsychiatric disorder with evidence of a strong genetic component in the complex etiologies. Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2), a member of the neurexin superfamily, plays an essential role in neural development. CNTNAP2 was considered as one of the most susceptible genes for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Some studies indicated the association of CNTNAP2 with ASD, while others reported no association. Given the inconsistent results of the previous studies, we performed a family-based association study between 9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CNTNAP2 and autism in 640 autistic trios in the Chinese Han population. Then, an updated meta-analysis, combined with the data from Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (iPSYCH-PGC ASD, 2017) and available association studies, was conducted. No SNPs were significantly associated with autism in the Chinese Han population. In the meta-analysis, the two frequently reported SNPs (rs2710102 and rs7794745) showed no significant association with ASD. Therefore, CNTNAP2 polymorphisms might not be associated with autism.

"Maternal immune activation (MIA) is associated with an increased risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in offspring. Animal experiments have found that interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-17a are key cytokines in the induction of ASD by MIA. Moreover, probiotics were verified to inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Therefore, we investigated whether the administration of oral probiotics during pregnancy might protect the offspring that have suffered MIA from developing ASD. Probiotics were orally administered to pregnant mice with/without the simultaneous administration of Poly(I:C). We found that oral probiotics prevented the ASD-like behaviors induced by MIA in offspring. Furthermore, oral probiotics prevented the MIA-induced increases in the IL-6 and IL-17a levels in both maternal serum and fetal brains, parvalbumin positive (PV<sup>+</sup> ) neuron loss, and the decrease in the &#x3b3;-aminobutyric acid levels in the prefrontal cortex of adult offspring. This work suggests that administering oral probiotics during pregnancy may help decrease the risk of ASD following MIA during pregnancy.

"A literature review was conducted on the genetic and developmental bases of autism in relation to genes and pathways associated with cancer risk. Convergent lines of evidence from four types of analysis: (1) recent theoretical studies on the causes of autism, (2) epidemiological studies, (3) genetic analyses linking autism with mutations in tumor suppressor genes and other cancer-associated genes and pathways, and (4) contrasts with schizophrenia, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease indicate that autism may involve altered cancer risk. This evidence should motivate further epidemiological studies, and it provides useful insights into the nature of the genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors underlying the etiologies of autism, other neurological conditions, and carcinogenesis.","A literature review was conducted on the genetic and developmental bases of autism in relation to genes and pathways associated with cancer risk.

"It has been suggested that atypicalities in low-level visual processing contribute to the expression and development of the unusual cognitive and behavioral profile seen in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, previous investigations have yielded mixed results. In the largest study of its kind (ASD n = 89; non-ASD = 52; mean age 15 years 6 months) and testing across the spectrum of IQ (range 52-133), we investigated performance on three measures of basic visual processing: motion coherence, form-from-motion and biological motion (BM). At the group level, we found no evidence of differences between the two groups on any of the tasks, suggesting that there is no fundamental visual motion processing deficit in individuals with an ASD, at least by adolescence. However, we identified a tail of individuals with ASD (18% of the sample) who had exceptionally poor BM processing abilities compared to the non-ASD group, and who were characterized by low IQ. For the entire sample of those both with and without ASD, performance on the BM task uniquely correlated with performance on the Frith-Happ&#xe9; animations, a higher-level task that demands the interpretation of moving, interacting agents in order to understand mental states. We hypothesize that this association reflects the shared social-cognitive characteristics of the two tasks, which have a common neural underpinning in the superior temporal sulcus.","It has been suggested that atypicalities in low-level visual processing contribute to the expression and development of the unusual cognitive and behavioral profile seen in autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

"Individuals suffering from autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often show a tendency for detail- or feature-based perception (also referred to as ""local processing bias"") instead of more holistic stimulus processing typical for unaffected people. This local processing bias has been demonstrated for the visual and auditory domains and there is evidence that multisensory processing may also be affected in ASD. Most multisensory processing paradigms used social-communicative stimuli, such as human speech or faces, probing the processing of simultaneously occuring sensory signals. Multisensory processing, however, is not limited to simultaneous stimulation. In this study, we investigated whether multisensory processing deficits in ASD persist when semantically complex but nonsocial stimuli are presented in succession. Fifteen adult individuals with Asperger syndrome and 15 control persons participated in a visual-audio priming task, which required the classification of sounds that were either primed by semantically congruent or incongruent preceding pictures of objects. As expected, performance on congruent trials was faster and more accurate compared with incongruent trials (crossmodal priming effect). The Asperger group, however, did not differ significantly from the control group. Our results do not support a general multisensory processing deficit, which is universal to the entire autism spectrum.","Individuals suffering from autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often show a tendency for detail- or feature-based perception (also referred to as ""local processing bias"") instead of more holistic stimulus processing typical for unaffected people.

"Many individuals with autism report generally low quality of life (QoL). Identifying predictors for pathways underlying this outcome is an urgent priority. We aim to examine multivariate patterns that predict later subjective and objective QoL in autistic individuals. Autistic characteristics, comorbid complaints, aspects of daily functioning, and demographics were assessed online in a 2-year longitudinal study with 598 autistic adults. Regression trees were fitted to baseline data to identify factors that could predict QoL at follow-up. We found that sleep problems are an important predictor of later subjective QoL, while the subjective experience of a person's societal contribution is important when it comes to predicting the level of daily activities. Sleep problems are the most important predictor of QoL in autistic adults and may offer an important treatment target for improving QoL.

"Food allergies are frequently reported to co-occur with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the prevalence of this co-occurrence remains uncertain. In the present study, we examined parent-reported prevalence of co-occurring food allergy and ASD in a nationally representative sample of US children ages 2-17 in the National Health Interview Survey, study years 2011-2015.

"The association of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with an altered mirror neuron system is still controversial. At the same time, the processing of object affordances by persons with ASD is a neglected issue. In this electroencephalographic study, adults differing in their autism quotient (AQ) scores were selected. We found anomalous modulation of mu and beta rhythms in high-AQ, compared to low-AQ persons, while they watched a set of goal-directed manual actions. This confirms that observing actions involving implicit intentions most clearly reveals the impairment of the mirror neurons system (MNS). The high-AQ group also showed anomalous mu and beta modulation when they looked at pictures of manipulable objects, indicating a deficit in processing motor affordances. We conclude that high-AQ adults have neural impairment of both the MNS and the affordance systems, which could underlie their relational problems with both people and objects.

"Few tools are available to comprehensively describe the unique social-emotional skill profiles of youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

SELweb scores showed good evidence of convergent and discriminant validity for three of the four skills it was designed to assess. Mean deficits were found for theory of mind, social problem solving, and self-control, whereas no mean deficits were found for emotion recognition. Individual profiles varied considerably, suggesting the sensitivity of SELweb to the within- and between-person individual differences among youth with ASD.

"The primary purpose of this study was to examine the underlying factor structure of the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF) in a large cohort of parents of young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A secondary goal was to examine relationships between PSI-SF factors and autism severity, child behavior problems, and parental mental health variables that have been shown to be related to parental stress in previous research. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to examine the three-factor structure described in the PSI-SF manual [Abidin, 1995]: parental distress, parent-child dysfunctional interaction, and difficult child. Results of the CFA indicated that the three-factor structure was unacceptable when applied to the study sample. Thus, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted and suggested a six-factor model as the best alternative for the PSI-SF index. Spearman's correlations revealed significant positive correlations with moderate to large effect sizes between the revised PSI-SF factors and autism severity, externalizing and internalizing child behaviors, and an index of parent mental health.

"Although face recognition deficits in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), including Asperger syndrome (AS), are widely acknowledged, the empirical evidence is mixed. This in part reflects the failure to use standardized and psychometrically sound tests. We contrasted standardized face recognition scores on the Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT) for 34 individuals with AS with those for 42, IQ-matched non-ASD individuals, and age-standardized scores from a large Australian cohort. We also examined the influence of IQ, autistic traits, and negative affect on face recognition performance. Overall, participants with AS performed significantly worse on the CFMT than the non-ASD participants and when evaluated against standardized test norms. However, while 24% of participants with AS presented with severe face recognition impairment (&gt;2 SDs below the mean), many individuals performed at or above the typical level for their age: 53% scored within +/- 1 SD of the mean and 9% demonstrated superior performance (&gt;1 SD above the mean). Regression analysis provided no evidence that IQ, autistic traits, or negative affect significantly influenced face recognition: diagnostic group membership was the only significant predictor of face recognition performance. In sum, face recognition performance in ASD is on a continuum, but with average levels significantly below non-ASD levels of performance.","Although face recognition deficits in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), including Asperger syndrome (AS), are widely acknowledged, the empirical evidence is mixed.

"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used quite extensively for examining morphological changes in human and animal brains. One of the many advantages to examining mouse models of human autism is that we are able to examine single gene targets, like that of Neuroligin3 R451C knockin (NL3 KI), which has been directly implicated in human autism. The NL3 KI mouse model has marked volume differences in many different structures in the brain: gray matter structures, such as the hippocampus, the striatum, and the thalamus, were all found to be smaller in the NL3 KI. Further, many white matter structures were found to be significantly smaller, such as the cerebral peduncle, corpus callosum, fornix/fimbria, and internal capsule. Fractional anisotropy measurements in these structures were also measured, and no differences were found. The volume changes in the white matter regions, therefore, are not due to a general breakdown in the microstructure of the tissue and seem to be caused by fewer axons or less mature axons. A larger radial diffusivity was also found in localized regions of the corpus callosum and cerebellum. The corpus callosal changes are particularly interesting as the thinning (or reduced volume) of the corpus callosum is a consistent finding in autism. This suggests that the NL3 KI model may be useful for examining white matter changes associated with autism.","Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used quite extensively for examining morphological changes in human and animal brains. One of the many advantages to examining mouse models of human autism is that we are able to examine single gene targets, like that of Neuroligin3 R451C knockin (NL3 KI), which has been directly implicated in human autism.","The NL3 KI mouse model has marked volume differences in many different structures in the brain: gray matter structures, such as the hippocampus, the striatum, and the thalamus, were all found to be smaller in the NL3 KI. Further, many white matter structures were found to be significantly smaller, such as the cerebral peduncle, corpus callosum, fornix/fimbria, and internal capsule. Fractional anisotropy measurements in these structures were also measured, and no differences were found.","The volume changes in the white matter regions, therefore, are not due to a general breakdown in the microstructure of the tissue and seem to be caused by fewer axons or less mature axons. A larger radial diffusivity was also found in localized regions of the corpus callosum and cerebellum. The corpus callosal changes are particularly interesting as the thinning (or reduced volume) of the corpus callosum is a consistent finding in autism.

"This study examined the social-ecological correlates of aggressive behavior in 120 youths with autism spectrum disorder. Youths were divided into three groups based on caregiver reports of the youth's aggressive acts: youths who engaged in acts of both physical and verbal aggression, youths who engaged only in acts of physical aggression, and nonaggressive youths. Caregivers and youths completed self-report instruments and behavior rating inventories that assessed youth individual functioning, family relations, and extrafamilial factors (i.e., peer relations, academic performance). Results showed that youths who engaged in both verbal and physical aggression were characterized by poor sleep quality and victimization by peers, and their caregivers evidenced high levels of distress and avoidant coping. In contrast, youths who were physically but not verbally aggressive were distinguished by difficulties in social interaction and communication. In general, each group of youths who were aggressive experienced more problems with repetitive behaviors, family relations, and academic performance than did their nonaggressive counterparts. The implications of these findings for theory, research, and treatment are discussed. Autism Res 2019. &#xa9; 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"This within-family study investigated whether mothers differentiate between children in their interactive behavior. Mothers were observed during a play and a task interaction separately with their child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (between 46 and 84 months old, M = 68) and with a younger sibling (between 29 and 67 months old, M = 48). Additionally, the social behavior of the children with ASD and their non-ASD siblings was compared. Results show that mothers differentiated in their responsiveness but not in their initiatives toward the children. Children with ASD and their non-ASD siblings were equally responsive but children with ASD were more imperative toward their caregiver. Several interpretations of these findings are discussed. Finally, it is concluded that family-based interventions will benefit from a better understanding of the effect of ASD on mother-child interactions within families with a child with ASD. Therefore, between-family studies should be complemented with within-family studies.

"The Balb/c mouse is proposed as a model of human disorders with prominent deficits of sociability, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) that may involve pathophysiological disruption of NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission. A standard procedure was used to measure sociability in 8-week-old male genetically inbred Balb/c and outbred Swiss Webster mice. Moreover, because impaired sociability may influence the social behavior of stimulus mice, we also measured the proportion of total episodes of social approach made by the stimulus mouse while test and stimulus mice were allowed to interact freely. Three raters with good inter-rater agreement evaluated operationally defined measures of sociability chosen because of their descriptive similarity to deficits of social behavior reported in persons with ASDs. The data support previous reports that the Balb/c mouse is a genetic mouse model of impaired sociability. The data also show that the behavior of the social stimulus mouse is influenced by the impaired sociability of the Balb/c strain. Interestingly, operationally defined measures of sociability did not necessarily correlate with each other within mouse strain and the profile of correlated measures differed between strains. Finally, ""stereotypic"" behaviors (i.e. rearing, grooming and wall climbing) recorded during the session of free interaction between the test and social stimulus mice were more intensely displayed by Swiss Webster than Balb/c mice, suggesting that the domains of sociability and ""restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior"" are independent of each other in the Balb/c strain.","The Balb/c mouse is proposed as a model of human disorders with prominent deficits of sociability, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) that may involve pathophysiological disruption of NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission.","A standard procedure was used to measure sociability in 8-week-old male genetically inbred Balb/c and outbred Swiss Webster mice.

"Thyroid hormones substantially influence central nervous system development during gestation. We hypothesized that perturbations of early thyroid profiles may contribute to the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Thyroid pathways could provide a mechanism by which environmental factors that affect the thyroid system may impact autism occurrence or phenotypic expression. We investigated whether thyroxine (T4) levels at birth are associated with subsequent ASD, using two existing California study groups in multivariate analysis. One study group included children born in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1994, with cases identified through the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) and/or the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program of Northern California (244 cases, 266 controls); the other included children born in California in 1995, with cases identified through DDS (310 cases, 518 controls). Matched controls were selected from birth certificate records. This exploratory analysis suggested that infants with very low T4 (&lt;3rd percentile) may have higher ASD risk, although results reached statistical significance only for the 1995 study group (1995: OR = 2.74 (95% CI 1.30-5.75; 1994: OR = 1.71 (95% CI 0.57-5.19). A variety of alternate analyses were conducted with available data, without further resolution of the difference between the two study groups. The results of our study indicate that further studies are warranted to investigate whether thyroid hormone perturbations play a role in the development of ASD by evaluating additional potential confounders and genotype or phenotype in larger studies.",Thyroid hormones substantially influence central nervous system development during gestation.

"Neuroligin-3 is a member of the class of cell adhesion proteins that mediate synapse development and have been implicated in autism. Mice with the human R451C mutation (NL3), identical to the point mutation found in two brothers with autism spectrum disorders, were generated and phenotyped in multiple behavioral assays with face validity to the diagnostic symptoms of autism. No differences between NL3 and their wildtype (WT) littermate controls were detected on measures of juvenile reciprocal social interaction, adult social approach, cognitive abilities, and resistance to change in a spatial habit, findings which were replicated in several cohorts of males and females. Physical and procedural abilities were similar across genotypes on measures of general health, sensory abilities, sensorimotor gating, motor functions, and anxiety-related traits. Minor developmental differences were detected between NL3 and WT, including slightly different rates of somatic growth, slower righting reflexes at postnatal days 2-6, faster homing reflexes in females, and less vocalizations on postnatal day 8 in males. Significant differences in NL3 adults included somewhat longer latencies to fall from the rotarod, less vertical activity in the open field, and less acoustic startle to high decibel tones. The humanized R451C mutation in mice did not result in apparent autism-like phenotypes, but produced detectable functional consequences that may be interpreted in terms of physical development and/or reduced sensitivity to stimuli.","Neuroligin-3 is a member of the class of cell adhesion proteins that mediate synapse development and have been implicated in autism.

"Little is known about executive functions (EFs) associated with advanced theory of mind (ToM) abilities.

We assessed 29 participants (13 males) with the BAP who were relatives of children with ASD. Thirteen participants showed reduced ability to understand a faux pas. A discriminant function analysis correctly classified 79% of cases as impaired or unimpaired, with high sensitivity (80%) and specificity (77%), which was best predicted by language-mediated EFs, including verbal generativity, working memory, cognitive inhibition, and flexibility.

"Evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging studies suggest that atypical amygdala function plays a critical role in the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The handful of psychophysiological studies examining amygdala function in ASD using classical fear conditioning paradigms have yielded discordant results. We recorded skin conductance response (SCR) during a simple discrimination conditioning task in 30 children and adolescents (ages 8-18) diagnosed with high-functioning ASD and 30 age- and IQ-matched, typically developing controls. SCR response in the ASD group was uniquely and positively associated with social anxiety; and negatively correlated with autism symptom severity, in particular with social functioning. Fear conditioning studies have tremendous potential to aid understanding regarding the amygdale's role in the varied symptom profile of ASD. Our data demonstrate that such studies require careful attention to task-specific factors, including task complexity; and also to contributions of dimensional, within-group factors that contribute to ASD heterogeneity.",Evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging studies suggest that atypical amygdala function plays a critical role in the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

"Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) adopt less efficient strategies than typically developing controls (TD) on verbal problem-solving tests such as the Twenty Questions Task. This study examined the hypotheses that this can be explained by differences in (i) planning processes or (ii) selective attention. Twenty-two children with ASD and 21 TD controls matched for age (M(age) = 13:7) and cognitive ability (M(FSIQ) = 96.42) were tested on an adapted version of Twenty Questions and two planning tasks. ASD participants could recognize effective questions as well as TD participants on a forced-choice question discrimination task, but were observed to construct plans that were significantly less efficient. ASD performance was also specifically reduced when items could not be physically removed from the testing array, although this effect could be ameliorated by keeping a written record of participant questions during search. These findings indicate that ASD participants are sensitive to the within-task executive demands of Twenty Questions, but that their inefficiency in strategy relates to planning processes and question selection pretask.

"Grammar is frequently considered to be a strength in the cognitive profile of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs); however, few studies have investigated how abstract (i.e. distinct from specific lexical items) is the grammatical knowledge of individuals with ASD. In this study, we examine the extent to which children with ASD have abstracted the transitive (SVO) frame in English. Participants in a longitudinal study of language acquisition in children with autism (17 children with ASD averaging 41 months of age, 18 TD children averaging 28 months of age) were taught two novel verbs in transitive sentences and asked (via intermodal preferential looking) whether these verbs mapped onto novel causative vs. noncausative actions. Both groups consistently mapped the verbs onto the causative actions (i.e. they engaged in syntactic bootstrapping). Moreover, the children with ASD's performance on this task was significantly and independently predicted by both vocabulary and sentence-processing measures obtained 8 months earlier. We conclude that many children with ASD are able to generalize grammatical patterns, and this ability may derive from earlier lexical and grammatical knowledge.","Grammar is frequently considered to be a strength in the cognitive profile of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs); however, few studies have investigated how abstract (i.e. distinct from specific lexical items) is the grammatical knowledge of individuals with ASD.","In this study, we examine the extent to which children with ASD have abstracted the transitive (SVO) frame in English.

"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ) are both associated with response inhibition impairment. However, the relative pattern of deficits in these two disorders remains unclear.

Differences among groups in BPASS scores in the four assessed domains (social motivation, conversational skills, expressiveness, and restricted interests) were examined using multivariate ANOVA and post hoc comparisons. Further, ratings of videotapes by observers na&#xef;ve to family status were compared with live, non-naive ratings by observers who were aware of family status (non-na&#xef;ve). Findings demonstrate that the BPASS is an instrument resistant to rater bias. Parents from MPX autism families showed significantly more autism phenotype characteristics than the parents in the other groups. Moreover, the parents from simplex autism families did not differ from the parents of children with developmental delay or typical development. Finally, no differences between live, non-naive ratings and videotaped, naive ratings were observed. These findings suggest that characteristics of the BAP, specifically in the social and communication domains, are present in MPX autism parents to a greater degree than simplex autism and control parents. Further, the results provide support for the notion that genetic transmission mechanisms may differ between families with more than one child with autism and families with only one child with autism.","The broader autism phenotype (BAP) was assessed in parents who have two or more children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (multiplex (MPX) autism), parents who have no more than one child with ASD (simplex autism), parents who have a child with developmental delay without ASD, and parents who have typically developing children.","Clinicians, naive to parent group membership status, rated BAP characteristics from videotaped administration of the Broader Autism Phenotype Symptom Scale (BPASS).

"It has been proposed that people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have abnormal morphometry and development of the amygdala and hippocampus (AH). However, previous reports are inconsistent, perhaps because they included people of different ASD diagnoses, ages, and health. We compared, using magnetic resonance imaging, the in vivo anatomy of the AH in 32 healthy individuals with Asperger syndrome (12-47 years) and 32 healthy controls who did not differ significantly in age or IQ. We measured bulk (gray + white matter) volume of the AH using manual tracing (MEASURE). We first compared the volume of AH between individuals with Asperger syndrome and controls and then investigated age-related differences. We compared differences in anatomy before, and after, correcting for whole brain size. There was no significant between group differences in whole brain volume. However, individuals with Asperger syndrome had a significantly larger raw bulk volume of total (P&lt;0.01), right (P&lt;0.01), and left amygdala (P&lt;0.05); and when corrected for overall brain size, total (P&lt;0.05), and right amygdala (P&lt;0.01). There was a significant group difference in aging of left amygdala; controls, but not individuals with Asperger syndrome, had a significant age-related increase in volume (r = 0.486, P&lt;0.01, and r = 0.007, P = 0.97, z = 1.995).

"The authors examined pregnancy and obstetric complications in association with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in children of participants from the Nurses' Health Study II, a prospective national cohort with information collected through biennial mailed questionnaires since 1989. Logistic regression was used to obtain crude and adjusted odds ratios for ASD, and by diagnostic subgroup. Seven hundred and ninety-three cases were reported among 66,445 pregnancies. Pregnancy complications and obstetric suboptimality factors were assessed by maternal report of occurrence in first birth and, in secondary analyses, in any birth. Complications and a suboptimality score were significantly associated with having a child with ASD (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.26, 1.77, P&lt;0.0001 for pregnancy complications in first birth and 2.76, 95% CI 2.04, 3.74, P&lt;0.0001 comparing individuals with four or more obstetric suboptimality factors in first birth to those with none; results similar when assessed in any birth). In particular, gestational diabetes was associated with a significantly increased risk of ASD in results of primary and sensitivity analyses (OR in primary analysis = 1.76, 95% CI 1.34, 2.32, P&lt;0.0001); suboptimal parity and suboptimal age-at-first-birth were also individual factors associated with ASD. Associations were similar by diagnostic subgroup, suggesting autism, Asperger syndrome, and other Pervasive Developmental Disorders are all associated with pregnancy complications. Consistent with previous research, the general class of pregnancy complications was associated with ASD as a whole. Additional work will be required to more fully assess the role of gestational diabetes.","The authors examined pregnancy and obstetric complications in association with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in children of participants from the Nurses' Health Study II, a prospective national cohort with information collected through biennial mailed questionnaires since 1989.","Logistic regression was used to obtain crude and adjusted odds ratios for ASD, and by diagnostic subgroup.

"A growing body of evidence has indicated that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit abnormal reactions to sensory stimuli and impaired face processing. Although behavioral studies have reported that individual differences in sensory processing patterns are correlated with performance in face processing tasks, the neural substrates underlying the association between sensory processing patterns and face processing remain unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the present study examined the relationships between sensory processing patterns assessed with the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile (AASP) and brain activity during a one-back task with two types of stimuli (face or house pictures). We enrolled 18 Japanese adults with ASD and 19 age- and IQ-matched controls. Sensation Avoiding scores, which were assessed using the AASP, were positively correlated with right fusiform activity during the presentation of pictures of faces in the ASD group, but not in the control group. This suggests that abnormal sensory processing patterns in ASD are associated with abnormal face-related brain activity, possibly resulting in impaired face processing. Autism Res 2020, 13: 741-750. &#xa9; 2020 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Sensory abnormalities are one of the most common symptoms in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study shows that individuals with ASD who react abnormally to sensory stimuli also exhibit atypical brain activity when recognizing faces. Abnormal sensory processing may partly explain the difficulty that people diagnosed with ASD have in identifying others' faces.","A growing body of evidence has indicated that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit abnormal reactions to sensory stimuli and impaired face processing.

"Research indicates that relatives of individuals with autism have higher rates of affective disorders than both the general population and families of children with other developmental disabilities. In addition, individuals with autism have high rates of co-morbid mood and anxiety disorders. This study sought to identify possible reasons for these previous findings by documenting the presence of affective disorders in both probands (the individuals with autism) and their family members. A sub-sample of 17 adults with autism and their first-degree relatives from the Baltimore Family Study of Autism completed a structured psychiatric interview. The results indicated that the rates of mood and anxiety disorders were 35 and 77%, respectively, for probands, and these disorders were present in at least one first-degree relative at rates of 71 and 29%, respectively. Exploring patterns within families revealed that 80% of probands with a mother who had a mood disorder history also had a mood disorder themselves, compared to only 16% of probands whose mothers did not have a mood disorder history. The results must be considered preliminary given the small sample size. Replicating these findings in a larger sample would help clarify whether a true increased risk of mood disorder exists, which would have potential implications for prevention efforts and understanding possible genetic mechanisms.","Research indicates that relatives of individuals with autism have higher rates of affective disorders than both the general population and families of children with other developmental disabilities.

"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is considered among the most heritable of all neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, but identification of etiologically significant genetic markers and risk variants has been hampered by a lack of sufficiently large samples. Rapid phenotyping procedures, where self-report measures are used instead of extensive clinical assessment, have been proposed as methods for amassing large genetic databases due to their hypothesized time-efficiency and affordability. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of potential rapid phenotyping procedures using the Social Communication Questionnaire and the Social Responsiveness Scale in a sample of 333 children who also received extensive phenotypic assessments. While the rapid phenotyping measures were able to accurately identify a large number of children with ASD, they also frequently failed to differentiate children with ASD from children with other complex neurobehavioral profiles. These data support the continued need of expert clinical validation in combination with rapid phenotyping procedures in order to accurately amass large-scale genetic collections of children with ASD.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is considered among the most heritable of all neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, but identification of etiologically significant genetic markers and risk variants has been hampered by a lack of sufficiently large samples.

"Ground walking in humans is typically stable, symmetrical, characterized by smooth heel-to-toe ground contact. Previous studies on children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) identified various gait abnormalities. However, they produced inconsistent findings, particularly for the occurrence of toe walking and gait symmetry between feet, owing to their reliance on retrospective reports, visual analysis of videos, or kinematic analysis of the gait. The present study examined gait functions in children with ASD using plantar pressure that quantified foot-ground interaction with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Fifty-eight 4-6-year-old children with ASD (12 low-functioning and 46 high-functioning autism) and 28 age-matched typically developed children walked straight 6 m at their preferred speed for 10 repetitions. We found that both ASD groups walked with more flat-footed contact pattern, more left-right asymmetry, and larger step-to-step variability than their controls. Furthermore, these abnormal gait characteristics were related to social impairments measured by the Autism Spectrum Quotient and Social Responsive Scale, supporting a close association between impaired motor coordination and core symptoms of autism.

"In typically developing (TD) individuals, behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) studies suggest that audiovisual (AV) integration enables faster and more efficient processing of speech. However, little is known about AV speech processing in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This study examined ERP responses to spoken words to elucidate the effects of visual speech (the lip movements accompanying a spoken word) on the range of auditory speech processing stages from sound onset detection to semantic integration. The study also included an AV condition, which paired spoken words with a dynamic scrambled face in order to highlight AV effects specific to visual speech. Fourteen adolescent boys with ASD (15-17 years old) and 14 age- and verbal IQ-matched TD boys participated. The ERP of the TD group showed a pattern and topography of AV interaction effects consistent with activity within the superior temporal plane, with two dissociable effects over frontocentral and centroparietal regions. The posterior effect (200-300 ms interval) was specifically sensitive to lip movements in TD boys, and no AV modulation was observed in this region for the ASD group. Moreover, the magnitude of the posterior AV effect to visual speech correlated inversely with ASD symptomatology. In addition, the ASD boys showed an unexpected effect (P2 time window) over the frontocentral region (pooled electrodes F3, Fz, F4, FC1, FC2, FC3, FC4), which was sensitive to scrambled face stimuli. These results suggest that the neural networks facilitating processing of spoken words by visual speech are altered in individuals with ASD.","In typically developing (TD) individuals, behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) studies suggest that audiovisual (AV) integration enables faster and more efficient processing of speech.

"A range of scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities correlates with the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Among these are alterations of brain oscillations in the gamma-frequency EEG band in adults and children with ASD, whose origin has been linked to dysfunctions of inhibitory interneuron signaling. While therapeutic interventions aimed to modulate gamma oscillations are being tested for neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and frontotemporal dementia, the prospects for therapeutic gamma modulation in ASD have not been extensively studied. Accordingly, we discuss gamma-related alterations in the setting of ASD pathophysiology, as well as potential interventions that can enhance gamma oscillations in patients with ASD. Ultimately, we argue that transcranial electrical stimulation modalities capable of entraining gamma oscillations, and thereby potentially modulating inhibitory interneuron circuitry, are promising methods to study and mitigate gamma alterations in ASD.

"This study investigated cognitive differences between autistic and non-autistic people in understanding implied meaning in conversation using a novel computerized test, the Implicature Comprehension Test. Controlling for core language ability, autistic participants (N =&#x2009;66) were over twice as likely to endorse a non-normative interpretation of an implied meaning and over five times as likely to select ""do not know"" when asked about the presence of an implied meaning, compared to non-autistic participants (N =&#x2009;118). A further experiment suggested that the selection of ""do not know"" reflected a cognitive preference for certainty and explicit communication, and that the normative inference could often be made when the test format was more constrained. Our research supports the hypothesis that autistic individuals can find it challenging to process language in its pragmatic context, and that cognitive preferences play a role in this. LAY SUMMARY: We investigated differences between autistic and non-autistic people in understanding implied meanings in conversation. We found that autistic people were more likely to select a different interpretation of implied meanings compared to other people, and also much more likely to avoid processing implied meanings when the task allowed this. Our research supports the view that autistic people can find it challenging to process indirect meanings, and that they tend to prefer explicit forms of communication.","This study investigated cognitive differences between autistic and non-autistic people in understanding implied meaning in conversation using a novel computerized test, the Implicature Comprehension Test.","Controlling for core language ability, autistic participants (N = 66) were over twice as likely to endorse a non-normative interpretation of an implied meaning and over five times as likely to select ""do not know"" when asked about the presence of an implied meaning, compared to non-autistic participants (N = 118).

"Structural alterations in brain morphology have been inconsistently reported in children compared to adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We assessed these differences by performing meta-analysis on the data from 19 voxel-based morphometry studies. Common findings across the age groups were grey matter reduction in left putamen and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and grey matter increases in the lateral PFC, while white matter decreases were seen mainly in the children in frontostriatal pathways. In the ASD sample, children/adolescents were more likely than adults to have increased grey matter in bilateral fusiform gyrus, right cingulate and insula. Results show that clear maturational differences exist in social cognition and limbic processing regions only in children/adolescents and not in adults with ASD, and may underlie the emotional regulation that improves with age in this population.",Structural alterations in brain morphology have been inconsistently reported in children compared to adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).,We assessed these differences by performing meta-analysis on the data from 19 voxel-based morphometry studies.,"Common findings across the age groups were grey matter reduction in left putamen and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and grey matter increases in the lateral PFC, while white matter decreases were seen mainly in the children in frontostriatal pathways.

"The objectives of this study were to characterize gastrointestinal dysfunction (GID) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), to examine parental reports of GID relative to evaluations by pediatric gastroenterologists, and to explore factors associated with GID in ASD. One hundred twenty-one children were recruited into three groups: co-occurring ASD and GID, ASD without GID, and GID without ASD. A pediatric gastroenterologist evaluated both GID groups. Parents in all three groups completed questionnaires about their child's behavior and GI symptoms, and a dietary journal. Functional constipation was the most common type of GID in children with ASD (85.0%). Parental report of any GID was highly concordant with a clinical diagnosis of any GID (92.1%). Presence of GID in children with ASD was not associated with distinct dietary habits or medication status. Odds of constipation were associated with younger age, increased social impairment, and lack of expressive language (adjusted odds ratio in nonverbal children: 11.98, 95% confidence interval 2.54-56.57). This study validates parental concerns for GID in children with ASD, as parents were sensitive to the existence, although not necessarily the nature, of GID. The strong association between constipation and language impairment highlights the need for vigilance by health-care providers to detect and treat GID in children with ASD. Medications and diet, commonly thought to contribute to GID in ASD, were not associated with GID status. These findings are consistent with a hypothesis that GID in ASD represents pleiotropic expression of genetic risk factors.","The objectives of this study were to characterize gastrointestinal dysfunction (GID) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), to examine parental reports of GID relative to evaluations by pediatric gastroenterologists, and to explore factors associated with GID in ASD.","One hundred twenty-one children were recruited into three groups: co-occurring ASD and GID, ASD without GID, and GID without ASD.

"Homeobox A1 (HOXA1) has been proposed as a candidate gene for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as it regulates embryological patterning of hind-brain structures implicated in autism neurobiology. In line with this notion, a nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism within a highly conserved domain of HOXA1--A218G (rs10951154)--has been linked to both ASD risk, and cross-sectional differences in superior posterior lobar cerebellar anatomy in late adulthood. Despite evidence for early onset and developmentally dynamic cerebellar involvement in ASD, little is known of the relationship between A218G genotype and maturation of the cerebellum over early development. We addressed this issue using 296 longitudinally acquired structural magnetic resonance imaging brain scans from 116 healthy individuals between 5 and 23 years of age. Mixed models were used to compare the relationship between age and semi-automated measures of cerebellar volume in A-homozygotes (AA) and carriers of the G allele (Gcar). Total cerebellar volume increased between ages of 5 and 23 years in both groups. However, this was accelerated in the Gcar relative to the AA group (Genotype-by-age interaction term, P = 0.03), and driven by genotype-dependent differences in the rate of bilateral superior posterior lobar volume change with age (P = 0.002). Resultantly, although superior posterior lobar volume did not differ significantly between genotype groups at age 5 (P = 0.9), by age 23 it was 12% greater in Gcar than AA (P = 0.002). Our results suggest that common genetic variation within this putative ASD risk gene has the capacity to modify the development of cerebellar systems implicated in ASD neurobiology.","Homeobox A1 (HOXA1) has been proposed as a candidate gene for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as it regulates embryological patterning of hind-brain structures implicated in autism neurobiology.

"We provide a systematic review of epidemiological surveys of autistic disorder and pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) worldwide. A secondary aim was to consider the possible impact of geographic, cultural/ethnic, and socioeconomic factors on prevalence estimates and on clinical presentation of PDD. Based on the evidence reviewed, the median of prevalence estimates of autism spectrum disorders was 62/10 000. While existing estimates are variable, the evidence reviewed does not support differences in PDD prevalence by geographic region nor of a strong impact of ethnic/cultural or socioeconomic factors. However, power to detect such effects is seriously limited in existing data sets, particularly in low-income countries. While it is clear that prevalence estimates have increased over time and these vary in different neighboring and distant regions, these findings most likely represent broadening of the diagnostic concets, diagnostic switching from other developmental disabilities to PDD, service availability, and awareness of autistic spectrum disorders in both the lay and professional public. The lack of evidence from the majority of the world's population suggests a critical need for further research and capacity building in low- and middle-income countries.","We provide a systematic review of epidemiological surveys of autistic disorder and pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) worldwide.

"Camouflaging involves masking and/or compensating for autistic characteristics and has been identified in autistic individuals through a variety of different methods. Individual variation in the extent, processes and outcomes of camouflaging has been reported in autistic adults, and there has been some investigation of camouflaging by autistic adolescents. This study was conducted to better understand how some of these individual differences emerge, by examining potential mechanisms (theory of mind, executive function, intelligence quotient and age) involved in camouflaging by 58 autistic adolescents aged 13-18&#x2009;years (29 females, 29 males). Fewer executive function difficulties predicted greater use of total camouflaging strategies and the compensation subscale, but not the masking or assimilation subscales; no other predictors reached statistical significance. These findings suggest that individual differences in executive function ability may underlie variation in the use of camouflaging by adolescents. The total variance explained in the model was small, suggesting the need to examine other factors which may underpin camouflaging. The implications of this finding for the relationship between camouflaging and well-being are discussed, along with the distinction between attempts to camouflage and the efficacy of those attempts. LAY SUMMARY: Camouflaging involves hiding your autism or finding ways around difficulties in order to fit in during social situations. This study found that autistic teenagers with good executive function abilities camouflage their autism more than those who struggle with executive function (which includes planning, goal-direction and memory). This may have implications for teenagers' mental health and their social functioning.","Camouflaging involves masking and/or compensating for autistic characteristics and has been identified in autistic individuals through a variety of different methods.

"This paper describes the key basic elements required for a successful multi-parametric MRI data acquisition in awake children with autism. The procedure was designed by taking into account methodological challenges arising from the acquisition of Resting State fMRI (RS fMRI) data, and factors such as cost, time, and staff availability. The ultimate aim was to prepare an imaging preparation protocol with high transferability to the whole autism spectrum, adaptable for use in a multi-site research with multiple time points. As part of a randomized pharmaco-intervention study, 31 children aged 4-10&#x2009;years with Neurofibromatosis 1 and autism underwent MR imaging at baseline and end of intervention. The protocol consisted of tailored habituation instructions including gradual exposure to scanner noise, a social stories booklet, positive incentive strategies, and Play Therapy support. Success rate for initial acquisition was 71% for GABA+ MR spectroscopy at either location, 87% for perfusion, and 67% for diffusion assessment, and 71% for RS fMRI. Qualitative data indicated that 84% parents found the habituation protocol helpful. LAY SUMMARY: Here we describe a protocol for brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) tailored for children with ASD to help reduce stress and avoid sedation during scanning. This procedure can make advanced medical imaging more accessible and promote a better MRI experience for families of children with ASD.","This paper describes the key basic elements required for a successful multi-parametric MRI data acquisition in awake children with autism.

"There is growing interest in ""interoception"" (i.e., detection and interpretation of internal body signals) as a relevant mechanism contributing to certain symptoms and features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and alexithymia. However, inconsistent measurement and operationalization of interoception has led to confusion and inconsistent findings in the literature. In this commentary, we present alternative interpretations of findings from existing studies to demonstrate that ASD and alexithymia are conditions associated with reduced adaptive forms of interoceptive attention (i.e., attention toward bodily signals) but heightened maladaptive forms of interoceptive attention related to anxiety-induced somatization. Differentiating adaptive and maladaptive forms of interoceptive attention reveals a clearer pattern of findings in the research literature for further investigation of interoceptive processes that are involved in the neurobiology of ASD. However, interoception is a complex and multi-faceted construct that requires continual refinement in conceptualization and operationalization. Interoception research may benefit from self-report measures that clearly differentiate adaptive and maladaptive forms of bodily awareness. LAY SUMMARY: Some research suggests that autistic people have difficulty understanding bodily feelings such as hunger, illness, or emotions, whereas some studies have reported the opposite pattern of findings. We argue that this latter subset of studies reached false conclusions from using measures of bodily awareness that largely measure physical symptoms of anxiety. While attention to unpleasant bodily signals is an important ability necessary for maintaining healthy bodily functioning, excessive attention, and worry toward bodily signals can increase anxiety and be harmful.","There is growing interest in ""interoception"" (i.e., detection and interpretation of internal body signals) as a relevant mechanism contributing to certain symptoms and features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and alexithymia.

"Adults and children with typical development (TD) remember vocal melodies (without lyrics) better than instrumental melodies, which is attributed to the biological and social significance of human vocalizations. Here we asked whether children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), who have persistent difficulties with communication and social interaction, and adolescents and adults with Williams syndrome (WS), who are highly sociable, even indiscriminately friendly, exhibit a memory advantage for vocal melodies like that observed in individuals with TD. We tested 26 children with ASD, 26 adolescents and adults with WS of similar mental age, and 26 children with TD on their memory for vocal and instrumental (piano, marimba) melodies. After exposing them to 12 unfamiliar folk melodies with different timbres, we required them to indicate whether each of 24 melodies (half heard previously) was old (heard before) or new (not heard before) during an unexpected recognition test. Although the groups successfully distinguished the old from the new melodies, they differed in overall memory. Nevertheless, they exhibited a comparable advantage for vocal melodies. In short, individuals with ASD and WS show enhanced processing of socially significant auditory signals in the context of music. LAY SUMMARY: Typically developing children and adults remember vocal melodies better than instrumental melodies. In this study, we found that children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder, who have severe social processing deficits, and children and adults with Williams syndrome, who are highly sociable, exhibit comparable memory advantages for vocal melodies.

"The present study implemented an objective head pose tracking technique-OpenFace 2.0 to quantify the three dimensional head movement. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typical development (TD) were engaged in a structured conversation with an interlocutress while wearing an eye tracker. We computed the head movement stereotypy with multiscale entropy analysis. In addition, the head rotation range (RR) and the amount of rotation per minute (ARPM) were calculated to quantify the extent of head movement. Results demonstrated that the ASD group had significantly higher level of movement stereotypy, RR and ARPM in all the three directions of head movement. Further analyses revealed that the extent of head movement could be significantly explained by movement stereotypy, but not by the amount of visual fixation to the interlocutress. These results demonstrated the atypical head movement dynamics in children with ASD during live interaction. It is proposed that head movement might potentially provide novel objective biomarkers of ASD. LAY SUMMARY: Our study used an objective tool to quantify head movement in children with autism.

"There is a growing interest in the relationship between autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and eating disorders (EDs), two relatively common conditions lying on a spectrum from mild to severe clinical features. However, only limited data are available about pathological eating behaviors throughout adults on the autistic spectrum. The aim of the present study is to assess dysfunctional eating behaviors, including EDs manifestations and ASDs-related eating disturbances, in a population of adults with ASDs without intellectual disabilities. We recruited 106 adults on the autistic spectrum, without intellectual disability and 103 neurotypical adults (NAs). Participants completed the ""Eating Attitude Test"" (EAT-26), to measure symptoms and concerns characteristic of EDs, and the ""Swedish Eating Assessment for Autism Spectrum Disorders"" (SWEAA), to assess eating behaviors frequently observed within the autistic spectrum. Participants with ASDs scored significantly higher than NA at the EAT-26 and at the SWEAA. Moreover, participants with ASDs scored higher than NA at the EAT-26 subscales Dieting and Bulimia. The difference between groups remained significant after controlling for the effect of age, biological sex, and BMI. These results suggest that adults with ASDs without intellectual disability presented not only a higher prevalence of eating disturbances typical of the autistic spectrum, but also other symptoms of EDs in comparison to NA. LAY SUMMARY: For both scales assessing eating disturbances (EAT-26 and SWEAA), participants with ASDs scored higher than NA, presenting a higher prevalence both of eating disturbances typical of ASDs and of ED symptoms (distorted body image, tendency toward bulimic behaviors, and self-control of eating).","There is a growing interest in the relationship between autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and eating disorders (EDs), two relatively common conditions lying on a spectrum from mild to severe clinical features.

"Very little is known about the 30% of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) who remain minimally verbal when they enter school. Restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) are well-characterized in younger, preschool, and toddler samples.

Further work is required to understand the function and impact of RRBs in minimally verbal children."
"Younger siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; high-risk siblings) are at elevated risk for developing the broader autism phenotype (BAP), which consists of subclinical features of ASD. We examined conversational skills in a naturalistic context and standardized assessments of pragmatic language and communication skills in high-risk and low-risk school-age children with BAP (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;22) and ASD (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;18) outcomes, as well as comparison children without ASD or BAP (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;135). Children with BAP characteristics exhibited lower conversational skills than comparison children, but did not differ on any of three standardized measures. Only the conversational ratings significantly predicted membership in the BAP versus Comparison group. This suggests that naturalistic tasks are crucial when assessing social-communication difficulties in children with a family history of ASD. LAY SUMMARY: The broader autism phenotype (BAP) consists of subclinical features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is more common among family members of those with ASD. School-age children with BAP characteristics exhibited lower conversational skills than comparison children, but did not differ on standardized language measures tapping similar abilities. This suggests that naturalistic tasks may be more sensitive to the social-communication difficulties seen in some children with a family history of ASD than the standardized language tests used in most evaluations.","Younger siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; high-risk siblings) are at elevated risk for developing the broader autism phenotype (BAP), which consists of subclinical features of ASD.","We examined conversational skills in a naturalistic context and standardized assessments of pragmatic language and communication skills in high-risk and low-risk school-age children with BAP (n = 22) and ASD (n = 18) outcomes, as well as comparison children without ASD or BAP (n = 135).","Children with BAP characteristics exhibited lower conversational skills than comparison children, but did not differ on any of three standardized measures.

"This study examined the psychometric characteristics of the Cambridge-Mindreading Face-Voice Battery for Children (CAM-C) for a sample of 333 children, ages 6-12&#x2009;years with ASD (with no intellectual disability). Internal consistency was very good for the Total score (0.81 for both Faces and Voices) and respectable for the Complex emotions score (0.72 for Faces and 0.74 for Voices); however, internal consistency was lower for Simple emotions (0.65 for Faces and 0.61 for Voices). Test-retest reliability at 18 and 36&#x2009;weeks was very good for the faces and voices total (0.76-0.81) and good for simple and complex faces and voices (0.53-0.75). Significant correlations were found between CAM-C Faces and scores on another measure of face-emotion recognition (Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy-Second Edition), and between Faces and Voices scores and child age, IQ (except perceptual IQ and Simple Voice emotions), and language ability. Parent-reported ASD symptom severity and the Emotion Recognition scale on the SRS-2 were not related to CAM-C scores. Suggestions for future studies and further development of the CAM-C are provided. LAY SUMMARY: Facial and vocal emotion recognition are important for social interaction and have been identified as a challenge for individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Emotion recognition is an area frequently targeted by interventions. This study evaluated a measure of emotion recognition (the CAM-C) for its consistency and validity in a large sample of children with autism. The study found the CAM-C showed many strengths needed to accurately measure the change in emotion recognition during intervention.",Facial and vocal emotion recognition are important for social interaction and have been identified as a challenge for individuals with autism spectrum disorder.

"We explored the social synchronization of gaze-shift behaviors when responding to joint attention in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Forty-one children aged 5 to 8 with ASD and 43 typically developing (TD) children watched a video to complete the response to joint attention (RJA) tasks, during which their gaze data were collected. The synchronization of gaze-shift behaviors between children and the female model in the video was measured with the cross-recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA). Ultimately, we discovered that children with ASD had the ability to synchronize their gaze shifts with the female model in the video during RJA tasks. Compared to the TD children, they displayed lower levels of synchronization and longer latency in this synchronized behavior. These findings provide a new avenue to deepen our understanding of the impairments of social interaction in children with ASD. Notably, the analytic method can be further applied to explore the social synchronization of numerous other social interactive behaviors in ASD. LAY SUMMARY: This study explored how autistic children synchronized their gazed shifts with others' gaze cues during joint attention. We found that compared to typical children, autistic children synchronized their gazed shifts less and needed more time to follow others' gaze.

"Empirical evidence concerning sensory responsivity in young children who later develop autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remains relatively limited. It is unclear whether specific patterns or aspects of sensory responsivity underlay the emergence of the disorder. The goals of this study were to (a) examine whether social versus non-social context impacted the expression of sensory responsivity in infants at high risk for ASD, and (b) examine if sensory responsivity in social or non-social contexts was associated with severity of ASD symptoms. The Sensory Experiences Questionnaire 2.1 was collected for 338 infants (131 females, 207 males) at high-risk for ASD at 12 and/or 24&#x2009;months of age. High-risk toddlers meeting diagnostic criteria for ASD (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;75) showed elevated sensory responsivity in both social and non-social contexts at 12&#x2009;months of age and differences widened over the second year of life. Individuals with ASD demonstrate higher responsivity in both contexts suggestive of generalized atypical sensory responsivity in ASD. LAY SUMMARY: Behaviors such as avoiding or noticing sensory input (e.g., sounds, touches) are often different in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than those without. The reason for this is widely unknown. The findings from this study show that in toddlers, sensory responsivity increased in both social and non-social situations. Therefore, the setting of sensory input does not explain these differences.","Empirical evidence concerning sensory responsivity in young children who later develop autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remains relatively limited.

"Low physical fitness is associated with reduced physical activity and increased cardiovascular diseases. To date, limited research has compared physical fitness levels between children with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Therefore, the primary aim was to investigate if differences in fitness levels exist between children with ASD and age-matched neurotypically developing children (ND). The second aim was to examine if age, sex, height and weight could be used to predict potential fitness levels. The third aim was to examine if the developmental trajectory of fitness is comparable between children with ASD and ND children. The modified Eurofit test battery was used to compare fitness levels between 244 children aged 4-13&#x2009;years old (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;152 ND and n&#xa0;=&#xa0;92 ASD). Independent samples t tests and regression analyses were used to investigate differences in fitness levels between the two groups. The results indicated that statistically significant differences exist in fitness levels between children with ASD when compared to ND children across all ages, favoring the ND children, with small to large effect sizes noted (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05, d&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.36-1.13). Regression analysis could not accurately predict fitness measurements in children with ASD but could for ND children. The developmental trajectories were significantly delayed on the 20&#x2009;m sprint and standing broad jump for children with ASD when compared to ND children. Future studies should seek to address the disparities in physical fitness experienced by children with ASD by using relevant neuromuscular interventions.","Low physical fitness is associated with reduced physical activity and increased cardiovascular diseases.

"Previous studies on in utero exposure to maternal environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) or maternal active smoking and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have not been entirely consistent, and no studies have examined in utero cotinine concentrations as an exposure classification method. We measured cotinine in stored second trimester maternal serum for 498 ASD cases and 499 controls born in California in 2011-2012. We also obtained self-reported maternal cigarette smoking during and immediately prior to pregnancy, as well as covariate data, from birth records. Using unconditional logistic regression, we found no association between log10 cotinine concentrations and odds for developing ASD among children of non-smokers (aOR: 0.93 [95% CI: 0.69, 1.25] per ng/ml), which represents exposure to ETS, though there may be a possible interaction with race. We found no association between cotinine-defined smoking (&#x2265;3.08&#x2009;ng/ml vs. &lt;3.08&#x2009;ng/ml) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.73 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.35, 1.54)) or self-reported smoking (aOR: 1.64 [95% CI: 0.65, 4.16]) and ASD. In one of the few studies of ETS and the first with measured cotinine, our results indicate no overall relationship between in utero exposure to tobacco smoke from maternal ETS exposure or active smoking, and development of ASD. LAY SUMMARY: This study found that women who smoke or are exposed to tobacco smoke during pregnancy are not more likely to have children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This is the first ASD study to measure a chemical in the mother's blood during pregnancy to identify exposure to tobacco smoke.","Previous studies on in utero exposure to maternal environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) or maternal active smoking and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have not been entirely consistent, and no studies have examined in utero cotinine concentrations as an exposure classification method.","We measured cotinine in stored second trimester maternal serum for 498 ASD cases and 499 controls born in California in 2011-2012.

"ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects people across the entire lifespan, yet most of the research identifying the health and medical needs for autistic individuals have been among minors. As individuals with ASD transition to emerging adulthood, the services, already limited, become less available. This study aimed to identify the use of services for Latin American adults on the spectrum. We surveyed 295 caregivers of adults with ASD from six Latin American countries. Comparing the results for all the possible services observed in this study, the adults in our sample were primarily underserved: 84.4%-95.9% were receiving zero hours per week, 3.7%-12.9% 1%-10&#xa0;h, 0%-1.7% 11-20, and only 0%-1% above 20&#x2009;h of services. Almost half of the sample used medication, and neurologists were the most consulted health providers. Next to inexistent health care usage in Latin American adults with ASD highlights socioeconomic and health disparities in service provision for ASD in the region. The lack of services places adults with ASD in Latin America at a higher risk of worse symptom severity than autistic adults from regions with broader access to services. LAY SUMMARY: This study aimed to identify the quantity of services received by adults with autism in Latin America. Most of our sample was not receiving health services yet almost half had access to medication. This could mean that adults with autism in Latin America are at higher risk for poorer health.","ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects people across the entire lifespan, yet most of the research identifying the health and medical needs for autistic individuals have been among minors.

"The etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is complex, and its pathobiology is characterized by enhanced inflammatory activities; however, the precise pathobiology and underlying causes of ASD remain unclear. This study was performed to identify inflammatory indicators useful for diagnosing ASD. The mRNA expression of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;), was measured in cultured M1 and M2 macrophages from patients with ASD (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;29) and typically developed (TD) individuals (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;30). Additionally, TNF-&#x3b1; expression in the monocytes of patients with ASD (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;7), showing aberrations in TNF-&#x3b1; expression in M1/M2 macrophages and TD individuals (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;6), was measured. TNF-&#x3b1; expression in M1 macrophages and the TNF-&#x3b1; expression ratio in M1/M2 macrophages were markedly higher in patients with ASD than in TD individuals; however, this increase was not observed in M2 macrophages (M1: sensitivity&#xa0;=&#xa0;34.5%, specificity&#xa0;=&#xa0;96.7%, area under the curve&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.74, positive likelihood ratio&#xa0;=&#xa0;10.34; ratio of M1/M2: sensitivity&#xa0;=&#xa0;55.2%, specificity&#xa0;=&#xa0;96.7%, area under the curve&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.79, positive likelihood ratio&#xa0;=&#xa0;16.55).

"The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) is a simple and inexpensive tool for Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) assessments, with evidenced psychometric data from different countries. However, it is still unclear whether ASD symptoms are measured the same way across different societies and world regions with this tool, since data on its cross-cultural validity are lacking. This study evaluated the cross-cultural measurement invariance of the CARS among children with ASD from six countries, for whom data were aggregated from previous studies in India (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;101), Jamaica (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;139), Mexico (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;72), Spain (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;99), Turkey (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;150), and the United States of America (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;186). We analyzed the approximate measurement invariance based on Bayesian structural equation modeling. The model did not fit the data and its measurement invariance did not hold, with all items found non-invariant across the countries. Items related to social communication and interaction (i.e., relating to people, imitation, emotional response, and verbal and nonverbal communication) displayed lower levels of cross-country non-invariance compared to items about stereotyped behaviors/sensory sensitivity (i.e., body and object use, adaptation to change, or taste, smell, and touch response). This study found that the CARS may not provide cross-culturally valid ASD assessments. Thus, cross-cultural comparisons with the CARS should consider first which items operate differently across samples of interest, since its cross-cultural measurement non-invariance could be a source of cross-cultural variability in ASD presentations. Additional studies are needed before drawing valid recommendations in relation to the cultural sensitivity of particular items.","The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) is a simple and inexpensive tool for Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) assessments, with evidenced psychometric data from different countries.

"Researchers have identified that autistic individuals are encountering the criminal justice system as victims, offenders, and witnesses at high rates. The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is increasing and generating a comprehensive approach to addressing criminal justice system involvement among autistic individuals is a timely and urgent need. Revisions to an established framework generated for use among individuals with mental health diagnoses, the sequential Intercept Model (SIM), were produced by an international consortium of interdisciplinary stakeholders presenting a new opportunity to identify gaps in ASD research and generate preventive solutions across the criminal justice system. The revised SIM maps each criminal justice system component, or Intercept, and includes paths for the experiences of autistic individuals as victims or witnesses to crimes as well as offenders to catalyze new and interdisciplinary research, policy, and practice efforts. As the field of ASD research continues to grow, the revised SIM is a promising pathway to avoiding siloed research approaches, including diverse autistic voices, and contributing to international dialogue about criminal justice reform at a critical juncture. LAY SUMMARY: Autistic individuals are encountering the criminal justice system as victims, offenders, and witnesses at high rates. A revised version of the SIM generated by an international consortium provides a cohesive framework to ensure research focused on this topic extends across the criminal justice system. Preventing and improving interactions between autistic individuals and the criminal justice system is an urgent research, policy, and practice need.","Researchers have identified that autistic individuals are encountering the criminal justice system as victims, offenders, and witnesses at high rates.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unique challenges for families and caregivers, as well as for autism-focused clinicians, who are faced with providing a thorough and accurate evaluation of children's specific needs and diagnoses in the absence of in-person assessment tools. The shift to telehealth assessments has challenged clinicians to reconsider approaches and assumptions that underlie the diagnostic assessment process, and to adopt new ways of individualizing standard assessments according to family and child needs. Mandates for physical distancing have uncovered deficiencies in diagnostic practices for suspected autism and have illuminated biases that have posed obstacles preventing children and families from receiving the services that they truly need. This Commentary outlines several considerations for improving diagnostic practices as we move forward from the current pandemic and continue to strive to build an adaptable, sustainable, equitable, and family-centered system of care. LAY SUMMARY: Physical distancing and the abrupt end to in-person services for many children on the autism spectrum has forced clinicians to examine the existing challenges with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnostic assessment and consider things they want to keep and things that should be changed in the years ahead. New approaches such as telehealth both alleviated and exacerbated existing disparities, and brought into stark focus the importance of equitable and timely access to family-centered care. This commentary suggests ways of improving clinical practices related to ASD assessment to continue along this path.","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unique challenges for families and caregivers, as well as for autism-focused clinicians, who are faced with providing a thorough and accurate evaluation of children's specific needs and diagnoses in the absence of in-person assessment tools.

"Syndromic autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by impaired social communication and repetitive/stereotyped behaviors. Currently available therapeutic agents against ASD have limited efficacy. Thus, searching for novel and effective drugs ameliorating core symptoms, in particular social deficits, is of utmost importance. Duloxetine (DLX), an antidepressant that has been identified as an agonist mimetic for the cell adhesion molecule L1, exhibits beneficial functions in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the rapid and persistent neuroprotective function of DLX following valproic acid (VPA)-triggered hyperactivity, anxiety-like behavior and social deficits in zebrafish. Embryonic exposure to VPA reduced survival in a dose- and time-dependent manner, delayed hatching, and also resulted in a significant number of malformed larvae. After initial dose-response experiments in zebrafish larvae, 10&#xa0;&#x3bc;M VPA exposure between 0.33 and 4.5&#x2009;days post fertilization (dpf) was identified as an effective concentration that led to an early and persistent ASD-like phenotype in zebrafish. ASD-like elevated acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity and reduced Akt-mTOR signaling was observed in zebrafish whole brain. Acute administration of DLX (4.5-6 dpf) reduced the VPA-induced ASD-like phenotype in zebrafish larvae. Additionally, such early-life acute DLX treatment had long-term effects in ameliorating social impairments, hyperactivity, and anxiety-like behaviors through adulthood. This was accompanied by reduced AChE activity and by normalized Akt-mTOR signaling. Overall, DLX treatment showed a long-term therapeutic effect on autistic-like behaviors, and alteration of AChE activity and Akt-mTOR signaling were identified as crucial in the VPA-induced ASD zebrafish model.","Syndromic autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by impaired social communication and repetitive/stereotyped behaviors.

"Intellectual assessment in preschool autistic children bears many challenges, particularly for those who have lower language and/or cognitive abilities. These challenges often result in underestimation of their potential or exclusion from research studies. Understanding how different instruments and definitions used to identify autistic preschool children with global developmental delay (GDD) affect sample composition is critical to advance research on this understudied clinical population. This study set out to examine the extent to which using different instruments to define GDD affects sample composition and whether different definitions affect resultant cognitive and adaptive profiles. Data from the Mullen Scales of Early Learning and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Second Edition, a parent-report tool, were analyzed in a sample of 64 autistic and 73 neurotypical children (28-69&#x2009;months). Our results highlight that cognitive assessment alone should not be used in clinical or research practices to infer a comorbid diagnosis of GDD, as it might lead to underestimating autistic children's potential. Instead, using both adaptive and cognitive levels as a stratification method to create subgroups of children with and without GDD might be a promising approach to adequately differentiate them, with less risk of underestimating them.","Intellectual assessment in preschool autistic children bears many challenges, particularly for those who have lower language and/or cognitive abilities.

"The prevalence of autism worldwide has risen steadily in the last two decades, while bilingualism is also becoming increasingly prevalent in today's rapidly globalizing world. The current study aimed to investigate bilingualism effects in the pronoun resolution skills of children with autism in comparison to age-matched monolingual children with autism, as well as monolingual and bilingual children of typical development (&#x39d;&#xa0;=&#xa0;20 participants per group). Results showed that autistic children had general difficulty anchoring ambiguous pronouns to entities that were linguistically expressed in discourse, yet, the bilingual children with autism were more sensitive to the topicality of the entities in syntactic subject position and more prone to identify them as suitable referents of ambiguous null pronouns as compared to their monolingual peers. The findings suggest that bilingualism is not detrimental to autistic children's pronoun resolution skills. The current study aimed at determining how bilingualism influences ambiguous pronoun comprehension in children with autism as compared to bilingual and monolingual children of typical development. The findings show that bilingualism was not detrimental to the autistic children's pronoun resolution skills, further suggesting that having acquired more than one language does not exacerbate autistic children's deficits in the comprehension of pronouns.","The prevalence of autism worldwide has risen steadily in the last two decades, while bilingualism is also becoming increasingly prevalent in today's rapidly globalizing world.","The current study aimed to investigate bilingualism effects in the pronoun resolution skills of children with autism in comparison to age-matched monolingual children with autism, as well as monolingual and bilingual children of typical development (&#x39d;&#xa0;=&#xa0;20 participants per group).

"Whether autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with a global processing deficit remains controversial. Global integration requires extraction of regularity across various timescales, yet little is known about how individuals with ASD process regularity at local (short timescale) versus global (long timescale) levels. To this end, we used event-related potentials to investigate whether individuals with ASD would show different neural responses to local (within trial) versus global (across trials) emotion regularities extracted from sequential facial expressions; and if so, whether this visual abnormality would generalize to the music (auditory) domain. Twenty individuals with ASD and 21 age- and IQ-matched individuals with typical development participated in this study. At an early processing stage, ASD participants exhibited preserved neural responses to violations of local emotion regularity for both faces and music. At a later stage, however, there was an absence of neural responses in ASD to violations of global emotion regularity for both faces and music. These findings suggest that the autistic brain responses to emotion regularity are modulated by the timescale of sequential stimuli, and provide insight into the neural mechanisms underlying emotional processing in ASD.","Whether autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with a global processing deficit remains controversial.

"Chronic constipation is common among children with ASD and is associated with more severe hyperactivity, anxiety, irritability, and repetitive behaviors. Young autistic children with chronic constipation display higher urinary, and foecal concentrations of p-cresol, an aromatic compound produced by gut bacteria, known to negatively affect brain function. Acute p-cresol administration to BTBR mice enhances anxiety, hyperactivity and stereotypic behaviors, while blunting social interaction. This study was undertaken to prospectively assess the behavioral effects of gut mobilization in young autistic children with chronic constipation, and to verify their possible correlation with urinary p-cresol. To this aim, 21 chronically constipated autistic children 2-8&#x2009;years old were evaluated before (T0), 1&#x2009;month (T1), and 6&#x2009;months (T2) after intestinal mobilization, recording Bristol stool scale scores, urinary p-cresol concentrations, and behavioral scores for social interaction deficits, stereotypic behaviors, anxiety, and hyperactivity. Gut mobilization yielded a progressive and highly significant decrease in all behavioral symptoms over the 6-month study period. Urinary p-cresol levels displayed variable trends not significantly correlated with changes in behavioral parameters, mainly increasing at T1 and decreasing at T2. These results support gut mobilization as a simple strategy to ameliorate ASD symptoms, as well as comorbid anxiety and hyperactivity, in chronically constipated children. Variation in p-cresol absorption seemingly provides limited contributions, if any, to these behavioral changes. Further research will be needed to address the relative role of reduced abdominal discomfort following mobilization, as compared to specific modifications in microbiome composition and in gut bacteria-derived neuroactive compounds.","Chronic constipation is common among children with ASD and is associated with more severe hyperactivity, anxiety, irritability, and repetitive behaviors.

"Delays in motor development are not considered a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Yet, recent studies of infant siblings of children with ASD suggest that early delays in motor skills may be associated with later delays in developmental areas considered to be core features of an ASD diagnosis. While these studies demonstrate the longitudinal association between core features and motor delays observed at single time points, there is considerable interest in studying the trajectories of motor development over the first 3&#x2009;years of life. To accomplish this, we investigated early trajectories of motor development in a cohort of 499 infant siblings of children with ASD and 176 children with no family history of ASD. Data for the current study were drawn from the prospective, multi-site, Canadian Infant Sibling Study. We evaluated trajectories of fine and gross motor development over the first 3&#x2009;years using group-based trajectory modeling. Our results show that membership for both fine and gross motor trajectory groups was related to expressive language skills, receptive language skills, ASD symptom severity scores, and diagnostic classification at age 3. These results provide evidence that the trajectory of a child's early motor development may have important prognostic implications in ASD.","Delays in motor development are not considered a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

"Recent developments suggest that autistic individuals require dynamic angry expressions to have a higher speed in order for them to be successfully identified. Therefore, it is plausible that autistic individuals do not have a 'deficit' in angry expression recognition, but rather their internal representation of these expressions is characterised by very high-speed movement. In this study, matched groups of autistic and non-autistic adults completed a novel emotion-based task which employed dynamic displays of happy, angry and sad point light facial (PLF) expressions. On each trial, participants moved a slider to manipulate the speed of a PLF stimulus until it moved at a speed that, in their 'mind's eye', was typical of happy, angry or sad expressions. Participants were shown three different types of PLFs-those showing the full-face, only the eye region, and only the mouth region, wherein the latter two were included to test whether differences in facial information sampling underpinned any dissimilarities in speed attributions. Across both groups, participants attributed the highest speeds to angry, then happy, then sad, facial motion. Participants increased the speed of angry and happy expressions by 41% and 27% respectively and decreased the speed of sad expressions by 18%. This suggests that participants have 'caricatured' internal representations of emotion, wherein emotion-related kinematic cues are over-emphasised. There were no differences between autistic and non-autistic individuals in the speeds attributed to full-face and partial-face angry, happy and sad expressions respectively. Consequently, we find no evidence that autistic adults possess atypically fast internal representations of anger.","Recent developments suggest that autistic individuals require dynamic angry expressions to have a higher speed in order for them to be successfully identified.

"The present study objectives were to examine the performance of the new M-CHAT-R algorithm to the original M-CHAT algorithm. The main purpose was to examine if the algorithmic changes increase identification of children later diagnosed with ASD, and to examine if there is a trade-off when changing algorithms. We included 54,463 screened cases from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Children were screened using the 23 items of the M-CHAT at 18&#x2009;months. Further, the performance of the M-CHAT-R algorithm was compared to the M-CHAT algorithm on the 23-items. In total, 337 individuals were later diagnosed with ASD. Using M-CHAT-R algorithm decreased the number of correctly identified ASD children by 12 compared to M-CHAT, with no children with ASD screening negative on the M-CHAT criteria subsequently screening positive utilizing the M-CHAT-R algorithm. A nonparametric McNemar's test determined a statistically significant difference in identifying ASD utilizing the M-CHAT-R algorithm. The present study examined the application of 20-item MCHAT-R scoring criterion to the 23-item MCHAT. We found that this resulted in decreased sensitivity and increased specificity for identifying children with ASD, which is a trade-off that needs further investigation in terms of cost-effectiveness. However, further research is needed to optimize screening for ASD in the early developmental period to increase identification of false negatives.","The present study objectives were to examine the performance of the new M-CHAT-R algorithm to the original M-CHAT algorithm.

"This study was performed to determine (a) the age at which autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is first diagnosed in Ugandan children receiving mental health services, (b) whether age at diagnosis varies by sex and clinical presentation, and (c) the average age of ASD diagnosis in children manifesting comorbid conditions. A retrospective chart review was performed and demographic as well as clinical data were collected from children with ASD diagnoses who attended two mental health clinics in Uganda between 2014 and 2019. Descriptive statistics such as percentages, means, and standard deviations were used to summarize the data. Independent t-test was also performed to determine differences in the mean age of diagnosis between males and females. Two hundred and thirty-seven (156 males, 81 females) children with ASD were identified. The average age of ASD diagnosis was (6.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;4.0)&#x2009;years. A statistically significant difference in age of ASD diagnosis was found between males and females (t&#xa0;=&#xa0;-2.106, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.036), such that on average females received a diagnosis at least 1&#x2009;year later than males. Of the 237 participants, 53.6% were identified with ASD only, 16.0% had ASD and ADHD, 10.5% were diagnosed with ASD and epilepsy, and 7.2% had a diagnosis of complex ASD. The results confirm delays in access to ASD diagnosis and suggest that females are more likely to receive a ASD diagnosis later than males within the Ugandan context. ASD awareness should be intensified to improve public or professional knowledge about ASD to enhance early identification in Uganda.","This study was performed to determine (a) the age at which autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is first diagnosed in Ugandan children receiving mental health services, (b) whether age at diagnosis varies by sex and clinical presentation, and (c) the average age of ASD diagnosis in children manifesting comorbid conditions.","A retrospective chart review was performed and demographic as well as clinical data were collected from children with ASD diagnoses who attended two mental health clinics in Uganda between 2014 and 2019.

"Converging lines of evidence seem to indicate reduced self-referential processing in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, processing of one's own face has rarely been investigated in the context of ASD. Thus, the aim of the present study was to elucidate the role of attentional biases in the processing of self- and other faces in ASD. To achieve this goal we presented participants with images of their own face, the face of a close-other, and famous and unknown faces in a Stroop-like paradigm. Participants (22 with ASD, 22 typically developing [TD]) were instructed to indicate the color of presented faces while EEG was recorded. Our event-related potential results clearly showed that self-face was associated with larger P3 amplitudes than all other faces in the TD group, thus indicating a strong attentional bias toward one's own face. In the ASD group, P3 to the self-face and the close-other's face did not differ, suggesting similar attentional biases in both cases. In line with these P3 findings, nonparametric cluster-based permutation tests showed an analogous pattern of results: significant clusters for the self-face compared with all other faces in the TD group, and no significant cluster in the ASD group. Overall, our findings revealed impaired attentional bias to one's own face and diminished self versus other differentiation in individuals with ASD. The similar neural underpinnings of the self-face and other faces supports previous findings indicating reduced self-prioritization among individuals with ASD.","Converging lines of evidence seem to indicate reduced self-referential processing in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

"Advanced parental age at offspring birth has been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The objective of the current study was to investigate associations between parental age at birth and autism severity. The Rhode Island Consortium for Autism Research and Treatment (RI-CART) study represents a community-based sample with a range of autism severity, including participants with and without ASD. This study involved participants (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;1178) enrolled in RI-CART with available mother and father ages at birth. Primary data points included the age of mother and father at the participant's birth and results from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule - Second Edition (ADOS-2). Mothers were 1.7&#x2009;years older at the time of birth of the child with ASD, as compared to mothers of offspring without ASD. Fathers of children with ASD were 1.6&#x2009;years older at the time of birth than fathers of children without ASD. The age of both parents at offspring birth displayed a positive, statistically significant association with overall ASD severity and the severity of restricted/repetitive behaviors. This finding was driven by the association between parental age and the severity of compulsions or rituals. Intelligence and adaptive functioning did not moderate the relationship between parental age and ASD severity. This study extends prior research to show that advanced parental age at birth is associated with the severity as well as the presence of ASD in offspring.","Advanced parental age at offspring birth has been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

"Autism can be understood as a concealable stigmatized identity. This is the first systematic review to synthesize the literature on autistic people's experiences of stigma and coping strategies. 2877 studies were screened and 27 were included in this review. The reviewed literature demonstrates that autistic individuals are acutely aware of being stereotyped, judged, and discriminated by others. Autistic people also show signs of internalizing stigma, rendering them more vulnerable to low self-worth and poorer mental health. To manage the impact of stigma, the included studies suggest that autistic individuals may use these strategies: concealment and camouflaging, selective disclosure and self-advocacy, as well as positive reframing and reconstructing identity. However, the evidence is limited and mixed in terms of how helpful and effective these strategies are. Future studies should include autistic populations with a wider range of intellectual abilities and explore interventions that can support autistic people in managing stigma to supplement interventions that seek to reduce stigma towards autistic people. The power of language in perpetuating and challenging stigma also has important implications for research and practice, underscoring the need for researchers and practitioners to reflect carefully on the messages they are communicating about autism.","Autism can be understood as a concealable stigmatized identity.

"Social communication and interaction deficits are a diagnostic criteria of autism and integral to practitioner and researcher conceptualization. Culture is an influential factor in expectations for, and demonstration of, social communication and interaction skills, but there is limited research published in autism journals on this topic. This paucity of autism research examining cultural factors related to social communication and interaction may contribute to known identification disparities for racial and ethnic populations minoritized by systemic factors and research bias. We call for increased commitment from researchers to recruit racially and ethnically minoritized participants, prioritize investigating cultural expectations and perceptions of social communication and interaction, and evaluate measures related to social communication for cultural and linguistic responsivity. LAY SUMMARY: A diagnosis of autism requires the presence of deficits in social communication and interaction. Examples of these behaviors and skills include holding a back-and-forth conversation, the use of nonverbal communicative behaviors (e.g., gestures), and developing and maintaining social relationships. Culture influences the expectations for, and presentation of, these behaviors. However, research on this topic is lacking. Conducting more research related to culture and social communication could help reduce the disparities in autism identification across racially and ethnically minoritized populations.","Social communication and interaction deficits are a diagnostic criteria of autism and integral to practitioner and researcher conceptualization.

"Exome sequencing has been proposed as the first-tier genetic testing in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here, we performed exome sequencing in autistic individuals with average to high intellectual abilities (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;207) to identify molecular diagnoses and genetic modifiers of intervention outcomes of social skills group training (SSGT) or standard care. We prioritized variants of clinical significance (VCS), variants of uncertain significance (VUS) and generated a pilot scheme to calculate genetic scores of rare and common variants in ASD-related gene pathways. Mixed linear models were used to test the association between the carrier status of VCS/VUS or the genetic scores with intervention outcomes measured by the social responsiveness scale. Additionally, we combined behavioral and genetic features using a machine learning (ML) model to predict the individual response. We showed a rate of 4.4% and 11.3% of VCS and VUS in the cohort, respectively. Individuals with VCS or VUS had improved significantly less after standard care than non-carriers at post-intervention (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;9.35; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.036), while no such association was observed for SSGT (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-2.50; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.65). Higher rare variant genetic scores for synaptic transmission and regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II were separately associated with less beneficial (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;8.30, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0044) or more beneficial (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-6.79, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.014) effects after SSGT compared with standard care at follow-up, respectively.

"Nonhuman primates and especially rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) have been indispensable animal models for studies of various aspects of neurobiology, developmental psychology, and other aspects of neuroscience. While remarkable progress has been made in our understanding of influences on atypical human social behavior, such as that observed in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), many significant questions remain. Improved understanding of the relationships among variation in specific genes and variation in expressed social behavior in a nonhuman primate would benefit efforts to investigate risk factors, developmental mechanisms, and potential therapies for behavioral disorders including ASD. To study genetic influences on key aspects of social behavior and interactions-individual competence and/or motivation for specific aspects of social behavior-we quantified individual variation in social interactions among juvenile rhesus macaques using both a standard macaque ethogram and a macaque-relevant modification of the human Social Responsiveness Scale. Our analyses demonstrate that various aspects of juvenile social behavior exhibit significant genetic heritability, with estimated quantitative genetic effects similar to that described for ASD in human children. We also performed exome sequencing and analyzed variants in 143 genes previously suggested to influence risk for human ASD. We find preliminary evidence for genetic association between specific variants and both individual behaviors and multi-behavioral factor scores. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that spontaneous social behaviors performed by free-ranging juvenile rhesus macaques display significant genetic heritability and then to use exome sequencing data to examine potential macaque genetic associations in genes associated with human ASD.","Nonhuman primates and especially rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) have been indispensable animal models for studies of various aspects of neurobiology, developmental psychology, and other aspects of neuroscience.

"A number of studies have reported diminished attention to the eyes in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These studies predominantly used static images of faces as stimuli. Recent studies, however, have shown enhanced response to eye contact in typically developing (TD) individuals when they observe a person in a live interaction. We investigated physiological orienting to perceived eye contact in adolescents with ASD and TD adolescents when they observed a person in live interaction or viewed a photograph of the same person's face. We measured heart rate (HR) deceleration as an index of attentional orienting. Adolescents with ASD, as well as TD adolescents, showed significant HR deceleration for the direct gaze compared to an averted gaze in the live condition, but not in the photographic condition. The results suggest an intact response to perceived eye contact in individuals with ASD during a live face-to-face interaction. LAY SUMMARY: Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a different eye gaze pattern when observing photographic faces. However, little is known about how individuals with ASD process a real person's face. We measured heart rate (HR) and found that adolescents with ASD showed the typical decline in HR when they made eye contact with a real person, which suggests that both groups of individuals directed their attention to eye contact in a live face-to-face interaction.","A number of studies have reported diminished attention to the eyes in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with atypical visual processing and deficits in working memory (WM). Visual WM performance typically improves between childhood and adulthood, but such improvement may be atypical in ASD. To better understand how visual WM develops, we used a well-established change detection task across multiple visual features. We examined visual WM for color, shape, and pattern in children, adolescents, and adults with and without ASD. VWM capacity and performance for all visual features improved across age similarly for both the TD and ASD groups. While performance was better on set size 4 trials than set size 8 trials for color, shape, and no change trials, such an effect was not evident for pattern change trials. Overall, the present findings suggest that VWM for different visual features may be intact across development in ASD. The ability to hold multiple objects in mind (WM) improves across typical development, but it remains unclear whether such improvement occurs in ASD. We found that developmental improvements in WM for different types of object details (e.g., color, shape, and pattern) is generally similar for both ASD and typical development.

"Most published autism research, and the funding that supports it, remains focused on basic and clinical science. However, the public health impact of autism drives a compelling argument for utilizing a public health approach to autism research. Fundamental to the public health perspective is a focus on health determinants to improve quality of life and to reduce the potential for adverse outcomes across the general population, including in vulnerable subgroups. While the public health research process can be conceptualized as a linear, 3-stage path consisting of discovery - testing - translation/dissemination/implementation, in this paper we propose an integrated, cyclical research framework to advance autism public health objectives in a more comprehensive manner. This involves discovery of primary, secondary and tertiary determinants of health in autism; and use of this evidence base to develop and test detection, intervention, and dissemination strategies and the means to implement them in 'real world' settings. The proposed framework serves to facilitate identification of knowledge gaps, translational barriers, and shortfalls in implementation; guides an iterative research cycle; facilitates purposeful integration of stakeholders and interdisciplinary researchers; and may yield more efficient achievement of improved health and well-being among persons on the autism spectrum at the population-level. LAY SUMMARY: Scientists need better ways to identify and address gaps in autism research, conduct research with stakeholders, and use findings to improve the lives of autistic people. We recommend an approach, based in public health science, to guide research in ways that might impact lives more quickly.","Most published autism research, and the funding that supports it, remains focused on basic and clinical science.

"A functional promoter variant of the gene encoding the MET receptor tyrosine kinase alters SP1 and SUB1 transcription factor binding, and is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Recent analyses of postmortem cerebral cortex from ASD patients revealed altered expression of MET protein and three transcripts encoding proteins that regulate MET signaling, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (PLAUR) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (SERPINE1). To address potential risk conferred by multiple genes in the MET signaling pathway, we screened all exons and 5' promoter regions for variants in the five genes encoding proteins that regulate MET expression and activity. Identified variants were genotyped in 664 families (2,712 individuals including 1,228 with ASD) and 312 unrelated controls. Replicating our initial findings, family-based association test (FBAT) analyses demonstrated that the MET promoter variant rs1858830 C allele was associated with ASD in 101 new families (P=0.033). Two other genes in the MET signaling pathway also may confer risk. A haplotype of the SERPINE1 gene exhibited significant association. In addition, the PLAUR promoter variant rs344781 T allele was associated with ASD by both FBAT (P=0.006) and case-control analyses (P=0.007). The PLAUR promoter rs344781 relative risk was 1.93 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12-3.31) for genotype TT and 2.42 (95% CI: 1.38-4.25) for genotype CT compared to genotype CC. Gene-gene interaction analyses suggested a significant interaction between MET and PLAUR. These data further support our hypothesis that genetic susceptibility impacting multiple components of the MET signaling pathway contributes to ASD risk.","A functional promoter variant of the gene encoding the MET receptor tyrosine kinase alters SP1 and SUB1 transcription factor binding, and is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

"Early qualitative research indicates that autistic burnout is commonly experienced by autistic people and is associated with significant, negative consequences for their mental health, wellbeing, and quality of life, including suicidality. Findings to date suggest that factors associated with being autistic and the widespread lack of autism awareness and acceptance within society contribute to the onset and recurrence of autistic burnout. Based on autistic adults' descriptions of their lived experiences, a Conceptual Model of Autistic Burnout (CMAB) is proposed, which describes a series of hypothesized relationships between identified risk and protective factors that may contribute to, or buffer against, autistic burnout. The theoretical framework for the CMAB is based on the Social-Relational model of disability and neurodiversity paradigm, and the Job Demands-Resources model of burnout, and Conservation of Resources theory. The CMAB offers a holistic perspective for understanding individual, social, and environmental factors that can influence autistic burnout via various direct and indirect pathways. Autistic burnout research is in its infancy and the CMAB provides a foundation for future investigations about this condition. LAY SUMMARY: Although many autistic people describe experiencing autistic burnout, there has been little research on this topic.

The CMAB offers a holistic perspective for understanding individual, social, and environmental factors that can influence autistic burnout via various direct and indirect pathways.","Autistic burnout research is in its infancy and the CMAB provides a foundation for future investigations about this condition. LAY SUMMARY: Although many autistic people describe experiencing autistic burnout, there has been little research on this topic. Based on descriptions of autistic peoples' lived experiences, we developed a conceptual model to explore how various risk and protective factors may interact to contribute to, or prevent, autistic burnout.",1,1,1,"Autistic burnout research is in its infancy and the CMAB provides a foundation for future investigations about this condition.

"In the present study, we provide a preliminary evaluation of the validity and reliability of using weighting procedures to measure communication in play samples for preschool-aged boys with autism or fragile X syndrome (FXS). Because weighting procedure communication scores (WPCSs) reflect growth in both communicative frequency and complexity, establishing the psychometrics of the component scores, in addition to the overall metric, affords investigators the opportunity to describe growth within and across skills. Results, for both groups, provide support regarding the psychometric appropriateness (i.e., convergent validity, divergent validity, and internal consistency) for all WPCSs. That said, a trend was observed for reliability scores to be slightly lower or more variable in boys with autism than in boys with FXS. Finally, although significant associations were observed in the associations between WPCSs across play contexts, contexts effects were observed for all three WPCSs. Together, results from this study provide promising preliminary data indicating the utility of using WPCSs in children with neurodevelopmental disabilities. Lay Summary: Language supports long-term positive outcomes; it is important to identify accurate and flexible ways of measuring language in children over time. We considered the effectiveness of using a procedure that considers changes in the number of communication acts and the types of acts produced during a play session by preschool-aged boys with autism or fragile X syndrome. These procedures were found to be valid and reliable.","In the present study, we provide a preliminary evaluation of the validity and reliability of using weighting procedures to measure communication in play samples for preschool-aged boys with autism or fragile X syndrome (FXS).

"Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at high risk for sleep disturbances, but the mechanism underlying the association between sleep disturbances and ASD core symptoms is largely unknown. This study examined the relationship between sleep disturbances and ASD core symptoms, and the mediating role of gaze patterns during the facial emotion recognition (FER) task. The study included 57 children with ASD and 59 age- and intelligence-matched typically developing (TD) controls aged 3-7&#x2009;years. Parents reported their children's sleep disturbances and ASD core symptoms using the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) and Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). Children's gaze patterns during the FER task were recorded by an eye tracking method. We found (1) ASD children had more severe sleep disturbances than TD children; (2) ASD children had atypical gaze patterns and poor FER task performance as determined by lower accuracy and longer reaction time; (3) sleep disturbances were significantly associated with ASD core symptoms of social interaction, communication, and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior; and (4) atypical gaze patterns partially mediated the association between sleep disturbances and ASD core symptoms. These findings suggest the need for more comprehensive clinical interventions and more effective sleep interventions to improve ASD core symptoms. LAY SUMMARY: Sleep disturbances are very common in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The current study found that sleep disturbances were significantly associated with ASD core symptoms, and gaze patterns during facial emotion recognition task could partially mediate this relationship.","Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at high risk for sleep disturbances, but the mechanism underlying the association between sleep disturbances and ASD core symptoms is largely unknown.","This study examined the relationship between sleep disturbances and ASD core symptoms, and the mediating role of gaze patterns during the facial emotion recognition (FER) task.

"Bayesian models of autism suggest that alterations in context-sensitive prediction error weighting may underpin sensory perceptual alterations, such as hypersensitivities. We used an auditory oddball paradigm with pure tones arising from high or low uncertainty contexts to determine whether autistic individuals display differences in context adjustment relative to neurotypicals. We did not find group differences in early prediction error responses indexed by mismatch negativity. A dimensional approach revealed a positive correlation between context-dependent prediction errors and subjective reports of auditory sensitivities, but not with autistic traits. These findings suggest that autism studies may benefit from accounting for sensory sensitivities in group comparisons. LAY SUMMARY: We aimed to understand if autistic and non-autistic groups showed differences in their electrical brain activity measured by electroencephalography (EEG) when listening to surprising tones infrequently embedded in a statistical pattern. We found no differences between the autistic and the non-autistic group in their EEG response to the surprising sound even if the pattern switched, indicating their ability to learn a pattern. We did find that, as subjective sensory sensitivities (but not autistic traits) increased, there were increasingly large differences between the EEG responses to surprising tones that were embedded in the different statistical patterns of tones. These findings show that perceptual alterations may be a function of sensory sensitivities, but not necessarily autistic traits. We suggest that future EEG studies in autism may benefit from accounting for sensory sensitivities.","Bayesian models of autism suggest that alterations in context-sensitive prediction error weighting may underpin sensory perceptual alterations, such as hypersensitivities.

"Previous research has shown that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and developmental coordination disorder (DCD) may have overlapping social and motor skill impairments. This study compares ASD, DCD, and typically developing (TD) youth on a range of social, praxis and motor skills, and investigates the relationship between these skills in each group. Data were collected on participants aged 8-17 (n&#x2009;=&#xa0;33 ASD, n&#x2009;=&#xa0;28 DCD, n&#x2009;=&#xa0;35 TD). Overall, the clinical groups showed some similar patterns of social and motor impairments but diverged in praxis impairments, cognitive empathy, and Theory of Mind ability. When controlling for both social and motor performance impairments, the ASD group showed significantly lower accuracy on imitation of meaningful gestures and gesture to command, indicating a prominent deficit in these praxis skills in ASD. LAY SUMMARY: Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and developmental coordination disorder (DCD) have social and motor skill impairments to varying degrees. This study compares ASD, DCD, and typically developing (TD) youth on a range of social, praxis, and motor skills. ASD and DCD shared similar patterns of gross and fine motor skills, but differed in skills related to making gestures.

"The automatic retuning of phoneme categories to better adapt to the speech of a novel talker has been extensively documented across various (neurotypical) populations, including both adults and children. However, no studies have examined auditory perceptual learning effects in populations atypical in perceptual, social, and language processing for communication, such as populations with autism. Employing a classic lexically-guided perceptual learning paradigm, the present study investigated perceptual learning effects in Australian English autistic and non-autistic adults. The findings revealed that automatic attunement to existing phoneme categories was not activated in the autistic group in the same manner as for non-autistic control subjects. Specifically, autistic adults were able to both successfully discern lexical items and to categorize speech sounds; however, they did not show effects of perceptual retuning to talkers. These findings may have implications for the application of current sensory theories (e.g., Bayesian decision theory) to speech and language processing by autistic individuals. LAY SUMMARY: Lexically guided perceptual learning assists in the disambiguation of speech from a novel talker. The present study established that while Australian English autistic adult listeners were able to successfully discern lexical items and categorize speech sounds in their native language, perceptual flexibility in updating speaker-specific phonemic knowledge when exposed to a novel talker was not available. Implications for speech and language processing by autistic individuals as well as current sensory theories are discussed.","The automatic retuning of phoneme categories to better adapt to the speech of a novel talker has been extensively documented across various (neurotypical) populations, including both adults and children.

"Prior research suggests that while autistic people may demonstrate poorer facial emotion recognition when stimuli are human, these differences lessen when stimuli are anthropomorphic. To investigate this further, this work explores emotion recognition in autistic and neurotypical adults (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;196).

Results indicated that autistic individuals were not significantly different from neurotypicals on the standard version. However, autistic people outperformed neurotypicals on the cartoon version.

"The Screening Tool for Autism in Toddlers (STAT) is a validated stage-2 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) screening measure that takes 20&#x2009;minutes to administer and comprises 12 play-based items that are scored according to specific criteria. This study examines an expanded version (STAT-E) that includes the examiner's subjective ratings of children's social engagement (SE) and atypical behaviors (AB) in the scoring algorithm. The sample comprised 238 children who were 24-35&#x2009;months old. The STAT-E assessors had limited ASD experience to mimic its use by community-based non-specialists, and were trained using a scalable web-based platform.

Logistic regression, ROC curves, and classification matrices and metrics were used to determine the screening properties of STAT-E when scored using the original STAT scoring algorithm versus a new algorithm that included the SE and AB ratings. Inclusion of the SE and AB ratings improved positive risk classification appreciably, while the specificity declined.

"Deletions and duplications at the chromosomal region of 16p11.2 have a broad range of phenotypic effects including increased likelihood of intellectual disability, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), epilepsy, and language and motor delays. However, whether and how sensory processing is affected has not yet been considered in detail. Parents/caregivers of 38 children with a 16p11.2 deletion and 31 children with a 16p11.2 duplication completed the Sensory Behavior Questionnaire (SBQ) and the Child Sensory Profile 2 (CSP-2) along with other standardized questionnaires assessing autistic traits (SRS-2), ADHD traits (Conners 3), anxiety (SCAS-P) and adaptive behavior (VABS-3). SBQ and CSP-2 responses found that sensory processing differences were clearly evident in both 16p11.2 deletion and 16p11.2 duplication, though there was significant variation in both cohorts. SBQ data indicated the frequency and impact of sensory behavior were more severe when compared to neurotypical children, with levels being similar to autistic children. CSP-2 data indicated over 70% of children displayed clear differences in sensory registration (missing sensory input). Seventy-one percent with 16p11.2 duplications were also unusually sensitive to sensory information and 57% with 16p11.2 duplications were unusually avoidant of sensory stimuli. This first detailed assessment of sensory processing, alongside other clinical features, in relatively large cohorts of children with a 16p11.2 deletion and 16p11.2 duplication demonstrates that sensory processing differences have a profound impact on their lives.","Deletions and duplications at the chromosomal region of 16p11.2 have a broad range of phenotypic effects including increased likelihood of intellectual disability, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), epilepsy, and language and motor delays.

"Whether children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are more likely to be exposed to prescription opioids than others remains unknown. The Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database was employed, and 14,849 children and adolescents with ASD and 148,490 age- and sex-matched non-ASD controls were enrolled between 2001 and 2009 and followed up till the end of 2011.

"Previous work identified three subgroups of children with ASD based upon co-occurring conditions (COCs) diagnosed during the first 5&#x2009;years of life. This work examines prenatal risk factors, given by maternal medical claims, for each of the three subgroups: children with a High-Prevalence of COCs, children with mainly developmental delay and seizures (DD/Seizure COCs), and children with a Low-Prevalence of COCs. While some risk factors are shared by all three subgroups, the majority of the factors identified for each subgroup were unique; infections, anti-inflammatory&#xa0;and other complex medications were associated with the High-Prevalence COCs group; immune deregulatory conditions such as asthma and joint disorders were associated with the DD/Seizure COCs group; and overall pregnancy complications were associated with the Low-Prevalence COCs group.

"Anecdotal reports and a small number of research studies suggest possible behavioral improvements in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) during a fever. However, previous studies rely largely on retrospective reports of this phenomenon. Establishing a robust association between fever and reduction of ASD-related symptoms would promote opportunities for the development of innovative therapeutic interventions for children with ASD. In the current study, prospective data were collected from 141 children with ASD and 103 typically developing (TD) controls using parent responses to an 11-item behavioral survey. Behaviors when no illness was present, during a fever, the week after a fever, and during non-febrile illnesses for TD and ASD children were compared. Profiles of cases in which caregivers reported consistent behavioral improvements during fever are described. Data indicated worsening social, emotional/behavioral, and somatic symptoms during a fever regardless of diagnosis, with children with ASD demonstrating greater worsening of behaviors during a fever than TD children. Only three out of 141 children with ASD demonstrated consistent behavioral improvements during a fever; these children had a range of cognitive and adaptive skills. Children with ASD had stronger negative responses to fever than TD children. These findings contradict previous literature suggesting behavioral improvements for children with ASD. While improvements may occur for some children, it does not appear to be a common phenomenon. Additional research is needed to elucidate the nature of behavioral improvements in the subset of children with ASD who may respond positively to fever.","Anecdotal reports and a small number of research studies suggest possible behavioral improvements in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) during a fever.

"Autistic individuals are at an increased risk for both sleep disturbances and depression. While studies in the general population and in autistic adults have drawn general links between sleep disturbances and mental health, few studies have examined the extent to which specific sleep problems may be implicated in the extremely high rates of depression among autistic adults. This study aimed to describe the patterns of sleep disturbances in autistic young adults, and their associations with depressive symptoms while controlling for relevant demographic factors. A sample of 304 legally independent adults (age 18-35&#x2009;years old) with a childhood diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder self-reported on their average sleep behaviors during the past week and depressive symptoms on the Beck Depressive Inventory-II. A significant proportion (86.01%) of autistic young adults experienced at least one of the primary sleep disturbances of interest, including short total sleep time (39.59%), poor sleep efficiency (60.07%), and delayed sleep phase (36.18%). Additionally, lower sleep efficiency and delayed sleep phase were both associated with higher depressive symptoms. The associations between sleep and depressive symptoms identified in our study suggest that sleep treatments may hold potential for ameliorating depressive symptoms in autistic adults who also experience sleep problems. Further research using daily sleep diaries and objective measures of sleep behaviors, as well as longitudinal studies, are needed to understand how changes in sleep may relate to changes in depressive symptoms in autistic adults.","Autistic individuals are at an increased risk for both sleep disturbances and depression.

"Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience significant difficulties with emotion regulation. Theory and empirical evidence suggest substantial biological contributions to regulatory challenges, which may be related to core ASD symptoms. Respiratory sinus arrythmia (RSA) is a measure of parasympathetic nervous system activity that serves as a putative biomarker for emotion regulation. Higher baseline RSA and more RSA reactivity (parasympathetic withdrawal; RSA-R) in response to challenge appear adaptive in non-clinical populations, but existing evidence for children with ASD remains inconclusive. The current study examined correlates of observed emotion dysregulation in 61 children with ASD between the ages of 6 and 10&#x2009;years, including ASD symptom levels as well as both baseline RSA and concurrent RSA reactivity. Consistent with previous research, ASD symptom level was significantly correlated with observed dysregulation whereas additional factors such as child IQ were not. Baseline RSA was unrelated to observed dysregulation, but higher RSA reactivity predicted concurrent dysregulation above and beyond the contribution of child ASD symptoms. Findings contribute to an emerging understanding of dysregulation in these children, raise questions about the utility of traditional baseline RSA measures for this population, and clarify the functional significance of RSA reactivity as a risk factor for emotion dysregulation in children with ASD.","Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience significant difficulties with emotion regulation.

"Attenuated social attention has been described as a reduced preference for social compared to geometric motion in preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The locus coeruleus-norpinephrine (LC-NE) system modulates sensory reactivity and is a promising underlying mechanism. LC-NE activity is indexed by a stimulus-evoked pupillary response (SEPR) and partially by a luminance-adaptation pupillary response (LAPR), which were both shown to be aberrant in ASD. We examined whether SEPR and LAPR explain an attenuated social motion preference. We applied pupillometry via video-based eye tracking in young children (18-65&#x2009;months) with ASD (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;57) and typically developing (TD) children (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;39) during a preferential looking paradigm of competing social and geometric motion and a changing light condition paradigm. We found an attenuated social motion preference in the ASD compared to the TD group. This was accompanied by atypical pupillometry showing a smaller SEPR to social motion, a larger SEPR to geometric motion and a reduced LAPR to a dark screen. SEPR but not LAPR explained the group difference in social motion preference. An ASD diagnosis was statistically predicted by the social motion preference, while this effect was mediated by the inclusion of SEPR to geometric and social motion. Our findings suggest a decreased sensory reactivity to social and increased reactivity to non-social motion in ASD, which may concurrently contribute to an attenuated social attention. The LC-NE system is supported as a promising underlying mechanism of altered social attention in young children with ASD, while the specificity of findings remains to be addressed.","Attenuated social attention has been described as a reduced preference for social compared to geometric motion in preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

"A growing body of research suggests that locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system may function differently in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Understanding the dynamics of both tonic (resting pupil diameter) and phasic (pupil dilation response [PDR] and event-related potential [ERP]) indices may provide meaningful insights about the nature of LC-NE function in ASD. Twenty-four children with ASD and 27 age- and nonverbal-IQ matched typically developing (TD) children completed two experiments: (1) a resting eye-tracking&#xa0;task&#xa0;to measure tonic pupil diameter, and (2) a three-stimulus oddball paradigm to measure phasic responsivity using PDR and ERP. Consistent with prior reports, our results indicate that children with ASD exhibit increased tonic (resting pupil diameter) and reduced phasic (PDR and ERP) activity of the LC-NE system compared to their TD peers. For both groups, decreased phasic responsivity was associated with increased resting pupil diameter. Lastly, tonic and phasic LC-NE indices were primarily related to measures of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and not ASD, symptomatology. These findings expand our understanding of neurophysiological differences present in ASD and demonstrate that aberrant LC-NE activation may be associated with atypical arousal and decreased responsivity to behaviorally-relevant information in ASD.",A growing body of research suggests that locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system may function differently in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

"This study of infants from Hubei Province, China examined brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) and mental development index (MDI) as possible early indicators associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The 34 ASD cases and 102 controls who had recovered from perinatal conditions were matched for age, sex, gestational age, birth weight and maternal age. BAEP absolute latencies (AL) I, III, V and interpeak latencies (IPL) I-III, III-V, I-V were compared in ASD cases and controls at ages 1, 3 and 6&#xa0;months. MDI scores were compared in these infants from 1&#xa0;month to 2&#x2009;years old. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to test associations among ASD, BAEP and MDI. Results showed BAEP AL I, V and IPL III-V prolonged in the ASD group (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and MDI scores in ASD cases sharply declining from 12 to 24&#x2009;months (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).

"The electroretinogram (ERG) allows the investigation of retinal signaling pathways and has increasingly been applied in individuals with mental disorders in search for potential biomarkers of neurodevelopmental disorders. Preceding ERG examinations in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) showed inconsistent results, which might be due to the small number of participants, heterogeneity of the ASD population, differences in age ranges, and stimulation methods. The aim of this study was to investigate functional retinal responses in adults with ASD by means of the light-adapted (photopic) ERG. Light-adapted ERG measurements were obtained with the RETeval&#xae; system applying three different stimulation protocols. In the final analysis, the ERG parameters a-wave, b-wave, the photopic negative response (PhNR), the photopic hill parameters as well as additional amplitude ratios were compared between 32 adults with high-functioning ASD and 31 non-autistic controls. Both groups were matched with regard to sex and age. No significant functional retinal differences in amplitude or peak time of the a- or b-wave, PhNR, the photopic hill parameters or the ERG-amplitude ratios could be detected in individuals with ASD compared to non-autistic participants. The absence of electrophysiological functional retinal alterations in ASD, suggests that changes in visual perception, such as increased attention to detail or visual hypersensitivity in ASD, are not due to impairments at early levels of retinal signal processing.","The electroretinogram (ERG) allows the investigation of retinal signaling pathways and has increasingly been applied in individuals with mental disorders in search for potential biomarkers of neurodevelopmental disorders.

"The aim of this study was to examine potential synergistic effects between maternal autoimmune disease and early childhood infections and their association with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring.

Maternal autoimmune diagnoses and childhood infections before age 2&#x2009;years were identified from linked maternal and child hospital admissions, and ASD diagnoses by age 9&#x2009;years were identified from linked disability services data. Multivariable logistic regression assessed the association between each exposure and ASD and additive interaction between exposures, controlling for potential confounders.

"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by behavioral features that appear early in life. Although studies have shown that atypical brain functional and structural connectivity are associated with these behavioral traits, the occurrence and initial alterations of brain networks have not been fully investigated. The current study aimed to map early brain network efficiency and information transferring in infants at elevated likelihood (EL) compared to infants at typical likelihood (TL) for ASD in the first year of life. This study used a resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) approach to obtain the length and strength of functional connections in the frontal and temporal areas in 45 5-month-old and 38 10-month-old infants. Modular organization and small-world properties were detected in both EL and TL infants at 5 and 10&#xa0;months. In 5-month-old EL infants, local and nodal efficiency were significantly greater than age-matched TL infants, indicating overgrown local connections. Furthermore, we used a support vector machine (SVM) model to classify infants with or without EL based on the obtained global properties of the network, achieving an accuracy of 77.6%. These results suggest that infants with EL for ASD exhibit inefficiencies in the organization of brain networks during the first year of life.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by behavioral features that appear early in life.

"Individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC)&#xa0;describe differences in both social cognition and sensory processing, but little is known about the causal relationship between these disparate functional domains. In the present study, we sought to understand how a core characteristic of autism-reduced social attention-is impacted by the complex multisensory signals present in real-world environments. We tested the hypothesis that reductions in social attention associated with autism would be magnified by increasing perceptual load (e.g., motion, multisensory cues). Adult participants (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;40; 19 ASC) explored a diverse set of 360&#xb0; real-world scenes in a naturalistic, active viewing paradigm (immersive virtual reality&#x2009;+&#x2009;eyetracking). Across three conditions, we systematically varied perceptual load while holding the social and semantic information present in each scene constant. We demonstrate that reduced social attention is not a static signature of the autistic phenotype. Rather, group differences in social attention emerged with increasing perceptual load in naturalistic environments, and the susceptibility of social attention to perceptual load predicted continuous measures of autistic traits across groups. Crucially, this pattern was specific to the social domain: we did not observe differential impacts of perceptual load on attention directed toward nonsocial semantic (i.e., object, place) information or low-level fixation behavior (i.e., overall fixation frequency or duration). This study provides a direct link between social and sensory processing in autism. Moreover, reduced social attention may be an inaccurate characterization of autism. Instead, our results suggest that social attention in autism is better explained by ""social vulnerability,"" particularly to the perceptual load of real-world environments.","Individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) describe differences in both social cognition and sensory processing, but little is known about the causal relationship between these disparate functional domains.

Adult participants (N = 40; 19 ASC) explored a diverse set of 360° real-world scenes in a naturalistic, active viewing paradigm (immersive virtual reality + eyetracking). Across three conditions, we systematically varied perceptual load while holding the social and semantic information present in each scene constant.","We demonstrate that reduced social attention is not a static signature of the autistic phenotype. Rather, group differences in social attention emerged with increasing perceptual load in naturalistic environments, and the susceptibility of social attention to perceptual load predicted continuous measures of autistic traits across groups. Crucially, this pattern was specific to the social domain: we did not observe differential impacts of perceptual load on attention directed toward nonsocial semantic (i.e., object, place) information or low-level fixation behavior (i.e., overall fixation frequency or duration). This study provides a direct link between social and sensory processing in autism. Moreover, reduced social attention may be an inaccurate characterization of autism.

"The development of walking is associated with a shift in how neurotypical infants initiate social interactions. Walking infants are more likely to locate objects in distant places, carry them, and then share those objects by approaching caregivers and using gestures to show or offer their discoveries (i.e., moving bids). The simultaneous organization of the behaviors necessary to generate moving bids requires the coordination of multiple skills-walking, fine motor skills, and gesturing. Infants with an elevated likelihood (EL) for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit differences and delays in each of these behaviors. This study investigated interconnections between infant walking, social actions, and caregiver responses in 18-month-old EL infants with diverse developmental outcomes (ASD, non-ASD language delay, no diagnosis). We observed 85 infant-caregiver dyads at home during everyday activities for 45&#x2009;minutes and identified all times when infants walked, instances of walking paired with social action (i.e., approaching the caregiver, approaching while carrying an object, producing a moving bid), and whether caregivers responded to their infants' social actions. There were no group differences in infants' production of social actions. Caregiver responses, however, were more clearly modulated by outcome group. While all caregivers were similarly and highly likely to respond to moving bids, caregivers of EL-ASD infants were substantially more likely to respond when their infants simply approached them (with or without an object in hand). Taken together, this research underscores the complexity of EL infant-caregiver interactions and highlights the role that each partner plays in shaping how they unfold.","The development of walking is associated with a shift in how neurotypical infants initiate social interactions.

"Previous research has identified that patterns of cooccurring conditions (CoCs) associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) differ based on the presence of intellectual disability (ID).

"Formal autism diagnosis from a specialist trained in autism assessment is customary prior to a child accessing early, intensive autism-specific services. However, long wait lists for diagnostic evaluations and limited specialty workforce have created substantial delays. Additionally, lengthy multidisciplinary evaluations are costly to insurers, inconvenient to families, and disproportionally impact under-resourced families. Diagnostic delays can impede access to intervention services. These barriers, combined with evidence regarding the importance of receiving early, autism-specific treatment, demand new approaches enabling access to autism specific services before comprehensive evaluation. Pediatric primary care providers (PCPs) are often the only health care professionals with whom a family interacts during early childhood and can play a crucial role in helping children with autism symptoms access services. Many strategies for autism diagnosis in primary care are being developed and tested; however, they have yet to be broadly adopted by PCPs, primarily due to critical implementation barriers in primary care settings. There is also not enough evidence on the accuracy of PCPs' diagnostic impressions without extensive specialty support, resulting in PCP hesitancy in diagnosing ASD, as well as family and service provider hesitancy in accepting a PCP autism diagnosis. In this commentary, we explore the acute need for shortening waitlists for autism evaluations through a tiered diagnostic approach, in which PCPs can rule in or rule out autism in children, for whom diagnosis is clear, and refer more complex cases for specialist evaluations, and explore implementation challenges to this approach.","Formal autism diagnosis from a specialist trained in autism assessment is customary prior to a child accessing early, intensive autism-specific services.

Our findings suggest that if primary care providers can reliably rule in or rule out autism in straightforward cases, more complex cases can be referred efficiently to specialists, thereby expediting diagnosis and initiation of services.

"The objectives of this study were to (1) demonstrate the application of percentiles to advance the interpretation of patient-reported outcomes and (2) establish autism-specific percentiles for four Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures.

Data from the first study were used to develop autism-specific percentiles for PROMIS parent-proxy sleep disturbance, sleep-related impairment, fatigue, and anxiety. Previously established United States general population percentiles were applied to interpret PROMIS scores in both studies.

In the second study, the percentage of children with severe scores (defined as &#x2265;95th percentile in the general population) was 30% for anxiety, 25% for sleep disturbance, and 17% for sleep-related impairment, indicating a high burden of these problems among autistic children. Few children had scores at or above the autism-specific 95th percentile on these measures (3%-4%), indicating that their scores were similar to other autistic children.

"Conflicting associations exist between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and subcortical brain volumes. This study assessed whether obesity might have a confounding influence on associations between ASD and brain subcortical volumes. A comprehensive investigation evaluating the relationship between ASD, obesity, and subcortical structure volumes was conducted. Data obtained included body mass index (BMI) and T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance images for children with and without ASD diagnoses from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange database. Brain subcortical volumes were calculated using vol2Brain software. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were performed to explore the subcortical volumes similarly or differentially associated with BMI in children with or without ASD and examine association and interaction effects regarding ASD and subcortical volume impact on the Social Responsiveness Scale and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) scores.

"Whether parental psychiatric disorders are associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring has remained inconclusive. We examined the associations of parental psychiatric disorders with ASD in offspring.

A total of 24,279 children with ASD (diagnostic ICD-9-CM code: 299.x or ICD-10 code F84.x) and 97,715 matched controls were included.

"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by restricted interests and repetitive behaviors as well as social-communication deficits. These traits are associated with atypicality of functional brain networks. Modular organization in the brain plays a crucial role in network stability and adaptability for neurodevelopment. Previous neuroimaging research demonstrates discrepancies in studies of functional brain modular organization in ASD. These discrepancies result from the examination of mixed age groups. Furthermore, recent findings suggest that while much attention has been given to deriving atlases and measuring the connections between nodes, within node information may also be crucial in determining altered modular organization in ASD compared with typical development (TD). However, altered modular organization originating from systematic nodal changes are yet to be explored in younger children with ASD. Here, we used graph-theoretical measures to fill this knowledge gap. To this end, we utilized multicenter resting-state fMRI data collected from 5 to 10-year-old children-34 ASD and 40 TD obtained from the Autism Brain Image Data Exchange (ABIDE) I and II. We demonstrate that alterations in topological roles and modular cohesiveness are the two key properties of brain regions anchored in default mode, sensorimotor, and salience networks, and primarily relate to social and sensory deficits in children with ASD. These results demonstrate that atypical global network organization in children with ASD arises from nodal role changes, and contribute to the growing body of literature suggesting that there is interesting information within nodes providing critical markers of functional brain networks in autistic children.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by restricted interests and repetitive behaviors as well as social-communication deficits.

"Hopelessness in parents has implications for parents' own well-being as well as their ability to meet the needs of their children. In the present study, we examined the effect of maladaptive behaviors in children with autism on parental hopelessness, with particular attention to whether parental reflective functioning would moderate the effect of maladaptive behaviors on parental hopelessness. Our sample included 68 parents of children with autism between the ages of 3 and 18. Findings revealed a significant positive relationship between maladaptive behaviors in the children and hopelessness in the parents. Moreover, parental reflective functioning moderated the effect of child maladaptive behaviors on parental hopelessness, such that children's maladaptive behaviors were positively associated with parental hopelessness in parents with low (but not high) reflective functioning. Findings suggest parental reflective functioning may be a protective factor against parental hopelessness, and thus a possible target for interventions for hopelessness in parents whose children with autism exhibit greater maladaptive behaviors.","Hopelessness in parents has implications for parents' own well-being as well as their ability to meet the needs of their children.

"The purpose of this study was to identify behavioral and health-related profiles of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), based on the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health. A sample of 894 children with ASD (weighted sample N&#xa0;=&#xa0;768,181) were included in the analysis. All data were parent-reported and included measures on current diagnosis of ASD, general child health, weight status, physical activity (PA), screen time (ST), sleep duration, academic engagement, and social engagement. Latent class analysis, estimated with Mplus v. 8.4, was used to identify latent profiles of children with ASD. A three-profile solution was the best fitting model, per model fit criteria. Children in profile 1 had overall more positive attributes (better health and weight, PA, more engaged in school, little difficulty in making friends, and modest ST) relative to children in either profiles 2 or 3. Children in profile 2 had distinctly increased ST and more difficulty in making friends when compared with children in either other profile. A greater proportion of children in profiles 2 and 3 were receiving behavioral treatment compared to profile 1; however, no differences were observed among profiles according to ASD severity, medication status, or additional health conditions. Studies should examine causal mechanisms among health behaviors, academic achievement, and social engagement in youth with ASD.","The purpose of this study was to identify behavioral and health-related profiles of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), based on the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health.","A sample of 894 children with ASD (weighted sample N&#xa0;=&#xa0;768,181) were included in the analysis.

"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in communication, diminished social skills, and restrictive and repetitive behaviors and interests. ASD affects approximately 2.3% of the population and is highly heterogeneous, both phenotypically and genetically. As genomic technologies advance, our understanding of the genetic architecture of ASD is becoming clearer, encompassing spontaneous and inherited alterations throughout the genome, and delineating alterations that are either rare or common in the population. This commentary provides an overview of the genomic strategies and resulting major findings of genetic alterations associated with ASD.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in communication, diminished social skills, and restrictive and repetitive behaviors and interests.

"Measurement invariance, or the degree to which an instrument measures constructs consistently across subgroups, is critical for appropriate interpretations of measures. Given sex differences in the phenotypic and clinical presentation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it is particularly important to examine measurement invariance in autism instruments to ensure that ASD measures are not biased toward the more common male ASD phenotype. This study represents an important preliminary investigation evaluating the measurement equivalence of the Autism Impact Measure (AIM) across children and adolescents with ASD. The results indicated that the AIM demonstrated measurement invariance at the configural, metric, and scalar levels across sex in all five domains, including Repetitive Behavior, Communication, Atypical Behavior, Social Reciprocity, and Peer Interaction. These results suggest that ASD core symptoms assessed by the AIM were similar among male and female groups. In addition, the latent means for all five factors were not statistically significantly different across sex groups, revealing no systematic differences on any of the AIM subscales for males and females. Overall, this study showed that the AIM detects core ASD symptoms across all five areas equivalently in males and females and is not biased toward males with ASD.","Measurement invariance, or the degree to which an instrument measures constructs consistently across subgroups, is critical for appropriate interpretations of measures.

"Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) provides an excellent platform for examining the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF), which are key indices of brain functioning.

"The current study aimed at testing and developing alternative short versions of autism spectrum quotient (AQ-10) (adult [self-report], adult [parent-report], adolescent, and child versions) for use in Hong Kong. First, the various versions of AQ-10 developed in the United Kingdom (the AQ-10-UK) were applied to Hong Kong Chinese samples and demonstrated satisfactory discriminative power (AUCs 0.77-0.94). Second, the Hong Kong Chinese versions of AQ-10 (AQ-10-HK) were developed, using the same methodology as in the original UK study. There were some changes in the choice of items and cut-offs. The AQ-10-HK demonstrated slightly greater discriminative power (AUCs 0.88-0.97) to that of the AQ-10-UK, but the differences in AUCs were not statistically significant. Compared to the corresponding full-length versions, both the UK and HK short forms did not seem to lose any significant discriminative power. Yet, the various versions of AQ, be they the full-length or AQ-10, appeared to consistently exhibit slightly smaller AUCs with the Hong Kong Chinese samples than with the UK samples. So, this study found both cross-cultural similarities and differences. The AQ-10-HK was recommended for local practice to maximize the advantage gained. Yet, for international multi-site research collaboration, involving the UK and HK, the original AQ-10-UK can be used for direct comparison of data.","The current study aimed at testing and developing alternative short versions of autism spectrum quotient (AQ-10) (adult [self-report], adult [parent-report], adolescent, and child versions) for use in Hong Kong.","First, the various versions of AQ-10 developed in the United Kingdom (the AQ-10-UK) were applied to Hong Kong Chinese samples and demonstrated satisfactory discriminative power (AUCs 0.77-0.94).

"Clinically significant sleep problems affect up to 86% of the autistic population in school-age. Sleep problems can have negative impacts on child cognition, behavior, and health. However, sex differences in the prevalence and types of sleep problems are not well understood in autism. To evaluate sex differences in sleep problems in the school-age autistic population, we obtained parent-report of sleep problems on the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire and conducted direct assessments to establish diagnosis and intellectual ability in 6-12-year-old children (autism n&#xa0;=&#xa0;250; typical development [TD] n&#xa0;=&#xa0;114). Almost 85% of autistic females demonstrated sleep problems compared to 65.8% of autistic males, 44.8% of TD females, and 42.4% of TD males; a statistically significant increase for autistic females. Autistic females demonstrated increased bedtime resistance, sleep anxiety, and sleepiness, and decreased sleep duration, but did not differ in sleep onset delay, night wakings, parasomnias, or disordered breathing compared with autistic males. Intellectual ability was not related to increased sleep problems. Higher anxiety scores were associated with more sleep problems for males but not females. In one of the first studies to evaluate sex differences in sleep in the school-age, autistic population, autistic females demonstrated increased sleep problems compared to autistic males, TD females, and TD males. Current autism assessment and intervention practices may benefit from increased attention to sleep problems in autistic school-age females and to anxiety in autistic males to enhance well-being and behavioral and health outcomes.","Clinically significant sleep problems affect up to 86% of the autistic population in school-age.

"Interest in social camouflaging has led to a multiplicity of measurement methods of uncertain validity. This two-part investigation first used a systematic review (""Study 1"") to identify and appraise methods used to quantify camouflaging of autistic traits, using the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Status Measurement Instruments checklist. A total of 16 distinct measurement tools were identified; all are in the preliminary phases of psychometric evaluation. The systematic review highlighted: (1) the need for parent-report tools which specifically measure camouflaging; and (2) a lack of studies looking at associations between different methods of camouflaging, which limits understanding of their validity. ""Study 2"" aimed to begin to address these gaps in knowledge. We created a parent-report version of the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q) and evaluated its concurrent validity in autistic young people by examining associations with the self-report CAT-Q and a discrepancy measure. Discriminant validity was investigated by comparing all three methods of measuring camouflaging to a measure of social skills, to test whether they assess a construct distinct from social ability. The self- and parent-report CAT-Q were significantly related (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.47, 95% CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.24-0.65), and were related weakly (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.20, 95% CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;-0.06 to 0.43) and strongly (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.46, 95% CI&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.23-0.64), respectively, to the discrepancy approach.

"Eye tracking has long been used to characterize differences in social attention between autistic and non-autistic children, but recent work has shown that these patterns may vary widely according to the biological sex of the participants and the social complexity and gender-typicality of the eye tracking stimuli (e.g., barbies vs. transformers). To better understand effects of sex, social complexity, and object gender-typicality on social and non-social gaze behavior in autism, we compared the visual attention patterns of 67 autistic (ASD) and non-autistic (NA) males (M) and females (F) (ASD M&#xa0;=&#xa0;21; ASD F&#xa0;=&#xa0;18; NA M&#xa0;=&#xa0;14; NA F&#xa0;=&#xa0;14) across four eye tracking paradigms varying in social complexity and object gender-typicality. We found consistency across paradigms in terms of overall attention and attention to social stimuli, but attention to objects varied when paradigms considered gender in their stimulus design. Children attended more to gendered objects, particularly when the gender-typicality of the object matched their assigned sex. These results demonstrate that visual social attention in autism is affected by interactions between a child's biological sex, social scene complexity, and object gender-typicality and have broad implications for the design and interpretation of eye tracking studies.","Eye tracking has long been used to characterize differences in social attention between autistic and non-autistic children, but recent work has shown that these patterns may vary widely according to the biological sex of the participants and the social complexity and gender-typicality of the eye tracking stimuli (e.g., barbies vs. transformers).","To better understand effects of sex, social complexity, and object gender-typicality on social and non-social gaze behavior in autism, we compared the visual attention patterns of 67 autistic (ASD) and non-autistic (NA) males (M) and females (F) (ASD M = 21; ASD F = 18; NA M = 14; NA F = 14) across four eye tracking paradigms varying in social complexity and object gender-typicality.","We found consistency across paradigms in terms of overall attention and attention to social stimuli, but attention to objects varied when paradigms considered gender in their stimulus design.

"School-age children on the autism spectrum who are minimally verbal (MVAS) use a limited repertoire of spontaneous communicative spoken words and reveal large heterogeneity in cognitive functioning. Despite the challenges to form peer social engagement posed by their unique social-communicative profile, few interventions have targeted peer interactions in the MVAS population. This study explored predictors of individual differences in treatment response among 54 school-age minimally verbal autistic children (8-16&#x2009;years) following an RCT ""school-based peer social intervention"" (S-PSI) that compared two peer-oriented intervention modalities (conversation versus collaboration) versus a waitlisted control group. We examined autistic-symptom severity, age, verbal and nonverbal IQ, executive functions, and sensory-processing profile for their contribution to children's ability to form relevant spontaneous communication exchanges with a peer partner. Main findings revealed that larger deficits in sensory-processing (sensory-avoidance and sensory low-registration) and in executive functions contributed to greater growth in ""relevant"" (i.e., adequately attuned, participatory, reciprocal) communication following both interventions, but not for the waitlisted controls. Additionally, older participants with lower verbal and nonverbal IQ improved communication's relevancy more after the conversation intervention, whereas the collaboration intervention was more beneficial for younger participants. Lower autistic-symptom severity contributed to larger growth in relevancy for all groups. By identifying individual-level predictors of spontaneous, attuned, participatory, and reciprocal (i.e., ""relevant"") communication exchanges with peers, we optimized S-PSI personalization for this uniquely nonverbal, heterogeneous MVAS population. These new channels for tailoring peer interventions to better meet individuals' needs may result in reduced social isolation and loneliness and enhanced well-being.","School-age children on the autism spectrum who are minimally verbal (MVAS) use a limited repertoire of spontaneous communicative spoken words and reveal large heterogeneity in cognitive functioning.

"Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have shown impaired performance in canonical and nonsocial working memory (WM). However, no study has investigated social WM and its early development. Using biological motion stimuli, our study assessed the development of social and nonsocial WM capacity among children with or without ASD across the age span between 4 and 6 (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;150). While typically developing (TD) children show a rapid development from age 5 to 6, children with ASD showed a delayed development for both social and nonsocial WM capacity, reaching a significant group difference at age 6. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between social (but not nonsocial) WM capacity and the severity of autistic symptoms among children with ASD. In contrast, there is a positive correlation between both types of WM capacity and intelligence among TD children but not among children with ASD. Our findings thus indicate that individuals with ASD miss the rapid development of WM capacity in early childhood and, particularly, their delayed social WM development might contribute to core symptoms that critically depend on social information processing.","Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have shown impaired performance in canonical and nonsocial working memory (WM).

"People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and non-spectrum developmental delays frequently exhibit maladaptive behaviors throughout the lifespan, which can have pervasive effects on quality of life. Maladaptive behaviors have been shown to change over time as a function of various individual-level factors (e.g., cognitive ability), yet research is primarily limited to parent-reported measures. To expand upon this work, the present study aimed to examine trajectories of teacher- and parent-reported maladaptive behaviors (i.e., hyperactivity, irritability, social withdrawal) and to test whether individual-level predictors (e.g., autism features, verbal intelligence quotient) and school-related predictors (e.g., teacher type, student-adult ratio, personal aide, school type) impact these trajectories among 165 individuals with ASD or non-spectrum delays from ages 9 to 18. Multilevel models revealed that, according to both teacher and parent report, participants showed the greatest improvement in hyperactivity, less but still notable improvement in irritability, and stable levels of social withdrawal over time. Higher verbal ability and fewer ASD features, in addition to mainstream school placement, emerged as important individual- and school-related differences associated with fewer maladaptive behaviors over time. The multi-informant perspective and longitudinal design provide novel insight into the manifestations of these maladaptive behaviors across different contexts and across time. Findings highlight the consistency of teacher- and parent-reported trajectories over time and further emphasize the importance of targeting maladaptive behaviors using a multisystem intervention approach in both school and home contexts.","People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and non-spectrum developmental delays frequently exhibit maladaptive behaviors throughout the lifespan, which can have pervasive effects on quality of life.

"This review systematically synthesized evidence on the association between structural language ability and behaviors of concern (BoC) in autism. Four databases were searched for studies that included &gt;10 autistic participants, measures of structural language (content and/or form of language) and BoC, and an analysis of their association. BoCs included self-injurious behavior (SIB), aggression, tantrums, and externalizing behavior. Methodological quality of studies were assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Forty-five publications (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;11,961) were included. Forty studies were cross-sectional and five were prospective cohort studies. Over 70% of the studies investigating expressive language and SIB (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;10), aggression (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;5), tantrums (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;3), and externalizing behavior (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;17) reported an inverse association, where lower expressive language ability was associated with increased BoC. Eleven out of sixteen studies of combined expressive and receptive language reported an inverse relationship with SIB or aggression. All outcomes were rated as moderate to very low certainty of evidence. This review highlights evidence showing an inverse association between expressive or combined language ability and SIB, and externalizing behavior in autism. However, further high-quality studies that use standardized, consistent measures of language and behavior and investigate longitudinal associations are needed.

"To examine obesity prevalence in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and neurotypical (NT) youth living in rural and urban areas. Data is from the 2019 National Survey of Children's Health, a national dataset that collected information on child health and well-being. Overweight/obesity status was based on parent/caregiver report of child height and weight. Urban and rural status was determined by whether children lived in/near a city. Chi-square tests were conducted to examine differences in obesity prevalence in youth with ASD and NT youth living in rural and urban areas. Overall, 43.9% of youth with ASD were overweight/obese compared to 30.6% of NT youth (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001).

"Social attention is a critical skill for learning and development. Social attention difficulties are present in both non-syndromic autism spectrum disorder (nsASD) and fragile X syndrome (FXS), and our understanding of these difficulties is complicated by heterogeneity in both disorders, including co-occurring diagnoses like intellectual disability and social anxiety. Existing research largely utilizes a single index of social attention and rarely includes children with intellectual impairment or uses a cross-syndrome approach. This study investigated whether multi-trait social attention profiles including naturalistic initial eye contact, facial attention, and social scene attention differ in preschool children with nsASD and FXS matched on developmental ability (DQ) and contrasted to neurotypical (NT) controls. The relationship between DQ, ASD severity, and social anxiety and social attention profiles was also examined. Initial eye contact related to social scene attention, implicating that naturalistic social attention is consistent with responses during experimental conditions. Reduced eye contact and lower social scene attention characterized nsASD and FXS. Children with nsASD displayed less facial attention than FXS and NT children, who did not differ. Lower DQ and elevated ASD severity associated with decreased eye contact in nsASD and FXS, and lower DQ was associated with lower social scene attention in FXS. Sex, social anxiety, and age were not associated with social attention. These findings suggest social attention profiles of children with nsASD are highly similar to, yet distinct from, children with FXS. Children with nsASD may present with a global social attention deficit whereas FXS profiles may reflect context-dependent social avoidance.","Social attention is a critical skill for learning and development.

"Camouflaging involves the masking of autistic traits in social situations. While camouflaging may function as a potential barrier to the early diagnosis of autism, minimal research into camouflaging in autistic young people has been conducted. It is also important to evaluate the impact of camouflaging on the mental health of autistic children and adolescents. This study evaluated camouflaging in a sample of 359 female and 374 male autistic children and adolescents (4-17&#x2009;years, 48.9% females). Findings indicated that camouflaging was a significant predictor of internalizing (i.e., anxiety, depression, somatic complaints) symptoms, when controlling for age, gender, and IQ. We also found evidence for some gender differences in camouflaging. Parents endorsed more autistic traits for females compared with males, whereas there were no differences in autistic traits across sex in the clinician-administered assessment. There was also evidence for a relationship between age and camouflaging, with adolescents showing a larger discrepancy between parent and clinician reported autistic traits. This has implications for clinical assessment and future research and is important for understanding how best to support the mental health of autistic children and adolescents.","Camouflaging involves the masking of autistic traits in social situations.

"Atypical sensory perception has been recognized in autistic individuals since its earliest descriptions and is now considered a key characteristic of autism. Although the integration of sensory information (multisensory integration; MSI) has been demonstrated to be altered in autism, less is known about how this perceptual process differs with age. This study aimed to assess the integration of audiovisual information across autistic children and adolescents. MSI was measured using a non-social, simultaneity judgment task. Variation in temporal sensitivity was evaluated via Gaussian curve fitting procedures, allowing us to compare the width of temporal binding windows (TBWs), where wider TBWs indicate less sensitivity to temporal alignment. We compared TBWs in age and IQ matched groups of autistic (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;32) and neurotypical (NT; n&#xa0;=&#x2009;73) children and adolescents. The sensory profile of all participants was also measured. Across all ages assessed (i.e., 6 through 18&#x2009;years), TBWs were negatively correlated with age in the autistic group. A significant correlation was not found in the NT group. When compared as a function of child (6-12&#x2009;years) and adolescent (13-18&#x2009;years) age groups, a significant interaction of group (autism vs NT) by age group was found, whereby TBWs became narrower with age in the autistic, but not neurotypical group. We also found a significant main effect of age and no significant main effect of group. Results suggest that TBW differences between autistic and neurotypical groups diminishes with increasing age, indicating an atypical developmental profile of MSI in autism which ameliorates across development.","Atypical sensory perception has been recognized in autistic individuals since its earliest descriptions and is now considered a key characteristic of autism.

"As an integral part of autism spectrum symptoms, sensory processing issues including both hypo and hyper sensory sensitivities. These sensory specificities may result from an excitation/inhibition imbalance with a poorly understood of their level of convergence with genetic alterations in GABA-ergic and glutamatergic pathways. In our study, we aimed to characterize the hypo/hyper-sensory profile among autistic individuals. We then explored its link with the burden of deleterious mutations in a subset of individuals with available whole-genome sequencing data. To characterize the hypo/hyper-sensory profile, the differential Short Sensory Profile (dSSP) was defined as a normalized and centralized hypo/hypersensitivity ratio from the Short Sensory Profile (SSP). Including 1136 participants (533 autistic individuals, 210 first-degree relatives, and 267 controls) from two independent study samples (PARIS and LEAP), we observed a statistically significant dSSP mean difference between autistic individuals and controls, driven mostly by a high dSSP variability, with an intermediated profile represented by relatives. Our genetic analysis tended to associate the dSSP and the hyposensitivity with mutations of the GABAergic pathway. The major limitation was the dSSP difficulty to discriminate subjects with a similar quantum of hypo- and hyper-sensory symptoms to those with no such symptoms, resulting both in a similar ratio score of 0. However, the dSSP could be a relevant clinical score, and combined with additional sensory descriptions, genetics and endophenotypic substrates, will improve the exploration of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of sensory processing differences in autism spectrum.","As an integral part of autism spectrum symptoms, sensory processing issues including both hypo and hyper sensory sensitivities.

"Despite the prevalence of special interests (SIs) in autistic youth, research on SIs and how they are characterized is limited. Indeed, a significant challenge in identifying and classifying SIs lies in capturing the vast and diverse scope of potential interests in this population. The recently developed Special Interest Survey (SIS) is a caregiver-report measure to improve SI characterization by capturing a broad range of past and current SIs. In the present study, we performed a network analysis of the SIS to examine relations between SIs and identify distinct interest clusters. We analyzed data from 1992 caregivers of autistic youths who completed the SIS. The network of SIs was densely interconnected, characterized by six communities of interests: Fact-seeking, Engineering, Order-seeking, Object Attachment, Entertainment, and Scholarly Pursuits. Findings suggest that the structure of the observed network is likely to generalize to similar samples. Of all the SIs and their respective communities, behaviors related to Fact-seeking were identified as the most central, meaning that endorsement of these interests was most strongly related to co-endorsement of other SIs. These findings lay the groundwork for future work on SIs, such as improved assessment techniques and linkage of SIs to a broad range of demographic variables, youth characteristics, and autism symptoms.","Despite the prevalence of special interests (SIs) in autistic youth, research on SIs and how they are characterized is limited.

"A broad range of interests characterized by unusual content and/or intensity, labeled as circumscribed interests (CI), are a core diagnostic feature of autism. Recent evidence suggests that a distinction can be drawn between interests that, although characterized by unusually high intensity and/or inflexibility, are otherwise common in terms of their content (e.g., an interest in movies or animals), labeled as restricted interests (RI), and interests that are generally not salient outside of autism (e.g., an interest in traffic lights or categorization), labeled as unusual interests (UI). The current study aimed to further characterize RI and UI by exploring their association with age, sex, IQ, and social motivation, as well as to examine differences in the adaptive benefits and negative impacts of these two subdomains. Parents of 1892 autistic children and adolescents (M<sub>age</sub> &#xa0;=&#xa0;10.82, SD<sub>age</sub> &#xa0;=&#xa0;4.14; 420 females) completed an online survey including the Dimensional Assessment of Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors and the Social Communication Questionnaire. Both RI and UI were found to be highly frequent. Sex-based differences were observed in the content, but not intensity, of CI such that females were more likely to show interests with a social component. Finally, RI and UI showed distinct patterns of association with age, sex, IQ, and social motivation, as well as metrics of adaptive benefits and negative impacts. Findings afford a more nuanced understanding of sex-based differences in CI and, crucially, provide preliminary evidence that RI and UI represent distinct constructs that should be studied independently in future research.","A broad range of interests characterized by unusual content and/or intensity, labeled as circumscribed interests (CI), are a core diagnostic feature of autism.

"Over the past two decades, there have been increasing discussions around which terms should be used to talk about autism. Whilst these discussions have largely revolved around the suitability of identity-first language and person-first language, more recently this debate has broadened to encompass other autism-related terminology (e.g., 'high-functioning'). To date, academic studies have not investigated the language preferences of autistic individuals outside of the United Kingdom or Australia, nor have they compared levels of endorsement across countries. Hence, the current study adopted a mixed-methods approach, employing both quantitative and qualitative techniques, to explore the linguistic preferences of 654 English-speaking autistic adults across the globe. Despite variation in levels of endorsement between countries, we found that the most popular terms were similar-the terms 'Autism', 'Autistic person', 'Is autistic', 'Neurological/Brain Difference', 'Differences', 'Challenges', 'Difficulties', 'Neurotypical people', and 'Neurotypicals' were consistently favored across countries. Despite relative consensus across groups, both our quantitative and qualitative data demonstrate that there is no universally accepted way to talk about autism. Our thematic analysis revealed the reasons underlying participants' preferences, generating six core themes, and illuminated an important guiding principle-to respect personal preferences. These findings have significant implications for informing practice, research and language policy worldwide.","Over the past two decades, there have been increasing discussions around which terms should be used to talk about autism.

"Cerebellar abnormalities have been reported in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Beyond its role in hallmark features of ASD, the cerebellum and its connectivity with forebrain structures also play a role in navigation. However, the current understanding of navigation abilities in ASD is equivocal, as is the impact of the disorder on the functional anatomy of the cerebellum. In the present study, we investigated the navigation behavior of a population of ASD and typically developing (TD) adults related to their brain anatomy as assessed by structural and functional MRI at rest. We used the Starmaze task, which permits assessing and distinguishing two complex navigation behaviors, one based on allocentric learning and the other on egocentric learning of a route with multiple decision points. Compared to TD controls, individuals with ASD showed similar exploration, learning, and strategy performance and preference. In addition, there was no difference in the structural or functional anatomy of the cerebellar circuits involved in navigation between the two groups. The findings of our work suggest that navigation abilities, spatio-temporal memory, and their underlying circuits are preserved in individuals with ASD.","Cerebellar abnormalities have been reported in autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Despite memory, IPS and EF being sensitive to age-related change, little is known about the cognitive profile of older adults with high autistic traits. This study explores cross-sectional memory, IPS and EF task performance in a large sample of older adults in the online PROTECT cohort (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;22,285, aged 50-80&#x2009;years), grouped by high vs. low autistic traits. Approximately 1% of PROTECT participants (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;325) endorsed high autistic traits [henceforth Autism Spectrum Trait (AST) group]. Differences between AST and age-, gender-, and education-matched comparison older adults (COA; n&#xa0;=&#x2009;11,744) were explored on memory, IPS and EF tasks and questionnaires administered online. AST had lower performance than COA on tasks measuring memory, working memory, sustained attention, and information processing. No group differences were observed in simple attention or verbal reasoning. A similar pattern of results was observed when controlling for age, and current depression and anxiety symptoms. In addition, AST self-reported more cognitive decline than COA, but this difference was not significant when controlling for current depression symptoms, or when using informant-report. These findings suggest that autistic traits are associated with cognitive function in middle-aged and later life. Older adults with high autistic traits experienced more performance difficulties in a range of memory, IPS and EF tasks compared with the low autistic traits comparison group. Further longitudinal work is needed to examine age-related change in both older autistic and autistic trait populations.","Cognitive differences in memory, information processing speed (IPS), and executive functions (EF), are common in autistic and high autistic trait populations.

"This systematic review includes a narrative synthesis and meta-analysis of research on the associations between primarily non-autistic people's characteristics and their attitudes toward autistic people. Of 47 studies included in the narrative synthesis, White undergraduate students were surveyed most frequently. Demographic characteristics were the factors most frequently tested for associations with attitudes, followed by contact-related factors (i.e., quantity and quality), knowledge about autism, trait and personality factors, and other factors that did not fit into a single category. Internal consistency was not reported for some instruments assessing raters' characteristics; some instruments had alpha levels lower than 0.70, and many characteristics of raters were measured using one-item measures. Moreover, theoretical motivations for investigating the raters' characteristics were rarely provided. A total of 36 studies were included in the meta-analysis, which showed that attitudes toward autistic people were significantly associated with participants' gender, knowledge about autism, and quality and quantity of their previous contact with autistic people, but not with their age or autistic traits. These findings indicate a need for more studies that focus on context-related characteristics (e.g., institutional variables such as support/commitment to inclusion), use reliable instruments to measure non-autistic people's characteristics, and situate their investigation in a theoretical framework.","This systematic review includes a narrative synthesis and meta-analysis of research on the associations between primarily non-autistic people's characteristics and their attitudes toward autistic people.

"This study describes social, mental health, and quality of life outcomes in early adulthood, and examines childhood predictors in the Special Needs and Autism Project (SNAP), a longitudinal population-based cohort. Young autistic adults face variable but often substantial challenges across many areas of life. Prediction of outcomes is important to set expectations and could lead to the development of targeted early intervention. Autistic children were enrolled at age 12 and parents reported outcomes 11&#x2009;years later when their children were age 23 (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;121). Thirty six percent of autistic adults were in competitive employment or education and 54% had frequent contact with friends. Only 5% of autistic adults were living independently, and 37% required overnight care. Moderate or severe anxiety and depression symptoms were found for 11% and 12% of young adults, respectively. Subjective quality of life was similar to UK averages except for social relationships. Using childhood IQ, autism traits and adaptive functioning meaningful predictions can be made of living situation, employment and education and physical health. Prediction was poor for friendships, mental health outcomes and other aspects of quality of life. Our results suggest that although young autistic adults face challenges across normative, social outcomes, they may be faring better in regard to mental health or quality of life. Childhood IQ, autism traits and adaptive functioning are most useful for predicting outcomes. After accounting for these factors, childhood measurements of behavioral and emotional problems and language offered little improvement in prediction of adult outcomes.",Young autistic adults face variable but often substantial challenges across many areas of life.

"Despite increasing awareness for diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and initiating treatments early in life, many children and adolescents continue to be diagnosed at a relatively older age. Focusing on children who first received an ASD diagnosis at age six or older, this study aimed to describe the symptoms that parents reported when ASD was diagnosed, follow the patients' clinical trajectory prior to receiving the diagnosis, and describe differences in symptoms and prior diagnoses between males and females cases. We included 258 children (205 males and 53 females) who were first diagnosed with autism at age 6-18 in 2017-2018. We retrieved demographic information, neurologic and developmental symptoms, diagnoses, and medications dispensing history from the children's electronic medical charts. The data indicated that prior diagnoses of language delays and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder were common among children with a late ASD diagnosis. Two thirds of the children were prescribed one or more medications to treat psychosocial and behavioral conditions before receiving a late ASD diagnosis. Difficulties in social relationships with peers were the leading reported symptoms by parents at the time of ASD diagnosis. Across these different domains, some differences were found between males and females, including a somewhat higher cognitive level in males, who were also more likely to present aggressive behavior.","Despite increasing awareness for diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and initiating treatments early in life, many children and adolescents continue to be diagnosed at a relatively older age.

"This study aimed to validate the short-story-task (SST) based on Dodell-Feder et al. as an instrument to quantify the ability of mentalizing and to differentiate between non-autistic adults and autistic adults, who may have acquired rules to interpret the actions of non-autistic individuals. Autistic (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;32) and non-autistic (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;32) adult participants were asked to read ""The End of Something"" by Ernest Hemingway and to answer implicit and explicit mentalizing questions, and comprehension questions. Furthermore, verbal and nonverbal IQ was measured and participants were asked how much fiction they read each month. Mentalizing performance was normally distributed for autistic and non-autistic participants with autistic participants scoring in the lower third of the distribution. ROC (receiver operator curve) analysis revealed the task to be an excellent discriminator between autistic and non-autistic participants. A linear regression analysis identified number of books read, years of education and group as significant predictors. Overall, the SST is a promising measure of mentalizing. On the one hand, it differentiates among non-autistic individuals and on the other hand it is sensitive towards performance differences in mentalizing among autistic adults. Implications for interventions are discussed.","This study aimed to validate the short-story-task (SST) based on Dodell-Feder et al. as an instrument to quantify the ability of mentalizing and to differentiate between non-autistic adults and autistic adults, who may have acquired rules to interpret the actions of non-autistic individuals.","Autistic (N = 32) and non-autistic (N = 32) adult participants were asked to read 'The End of Something' by Ernest Hemingway and to answer implicit and explicit mentalizing questions, and comprehension questions.

"Approximately 40% of American adults are affected by cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (e.g., high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and overweight or obesity), and risk among autistic adults may be even higher. Mechanisms underlying the high prevalence of CVD risk factors in autistic people may include known correlates of CVD risk factors in other groups, including high levels of perceived stress, poor sleep quality, and antipsychotic medication use. A sample of 545 autistic adults without intellectual disability aged 18+ were recruited through the Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research, Research Match. Multiple linear regression models examined the association between key independent variables (self-reported perceived stress, sleep quality, and antipsychotic medication use) and CVD risk factors, controlling for demographic variables (age, sex assigned at birth, race, low-income status, autistic traits). Overall, 73.2% of autistic adults in our sample had an overweight/obesity classification, 45.3% had high cholesterol, 39.4% had high blood pressure, and 10.3% had diabetes. Older age, male sex assigned at birth, and poorer sleep quality were associated with a higher number of CVD risk factors. Using antipsychotic medications was associated with an increased likelihood of having diabetes. Poorer sleep quality was associated with an increased likelihood of having an overweight/obesity classification. Self-reported CVD risk factors are highly prevalent among autistic adults. Both improving sleep quality and closely monitoring CVD risk factors among autistic adults who use antipsychotic medications have the potential to reduce risk for CVD.","Approximately 40% of American adults are affected by cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (e.g., high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and overweight or obesity), and risk among autistic adults may be even higher.

"Our previous cross-sectional investigation (Chetcuti et al., 2020) showed that infants with autism traits could be divided into distinct subgroups based on temperament. This longitudinal study builds on this existing work by exploring the continuity of temperament subgroup classifications and their associations with behavioral/clinical phenotypic features from infancy to toddlerhood. 103 infants (68% male) showing early signs of autism were referred to the study by community healthcare professionals and seen for assessments when aged around 12-months (Time 1), 18-months (Time 2), and 24-months (Time 3). Latent profile analysis revealed inhibited/low positive, active/negative reactive, and sociable/well-regulated subgroups at each timepoint, and a unique reactive/regulated subgroup at Time 3. Cross-tabulations indicated a significant likelihood of children having a recurrent subgroup classification from one timepoint to the next, and no apparent patterns to the movement of children who did change from one subgroup to another over time. Temperament subgroups were associated with concurrent child social-emotional functioning and autism traits, but unrelated to child age, sex, or developmental level. These findings suggest that temperament subgroup classifications might represent a reliable and very early indicator of autism characteristics and social-emotional functioning among infants/toddlers with autism traits.","Our previous cross-sectional investigation (Chetcuti et al., 2020) showed that infants with autism traits could be divided into distinct subgroups based on temperament.

"There is converging evidence that abnormal thalamocortical interactions contribute to attention deficits and sensory sensitivities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, previous functional MRI studies of thalamocortical connectivity in ASD have produced inconsistent findings in terms of both the direction (hyper vs. hypoconnectivity) and location of group differences. This may reflect, in part, the confounding effects of head motion during scans. In the present study, we investigated resting-state thalamocortical functional connectivity in 8-25&#x2009;year-olds with ASD and their typically developing (TD) peers. We used pre-scan training, on-line motion correction, and rigorous data quality assurance protocols to minimize motion confounds. ASD participants showed increased thalamic connectivity with temporal cortex relative to TD. Both groups showed similar age-related decreases in thalamic connectivity with occipital cortex, consistent with a process of circuit refinement. Findings of thalamocortical hyperconnectivity in ASD are consistent with other evidence that decreased thalamic inhibition leads to increase and less filtered sensory information reaching the cortex where it disrupts attention and contributes to sensory sensitivity. This literature motivates studies of mechanisms, functional consequences, and treatment of thalamocortical circuit dysfunction in ASD.","There is converging evidence that abnormal thalamocortical interactions contribute to attention deficits and sensory sensitivities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

"Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) present with a highly diverse set of challenges, disabilities, impairments and strengths. Recently, it has been suggested that researchers and practitioners avoid using certain words to describe the difficulties and impairments experienced by individuals with ASD to reduce stigma. The proposed limitations on terminology were developed by only a subset of the autism community, and the recommendations are already causing negative consequences that may be harmful to future scientific and clinical endeavors and, ultimately, to people with ASD. No one should have the power to censor language to exclude the observable realities of autism. Scientists and clinicians must be able to use any scientifically accurate terms necessary to describe the wide range of autistic people they study and support, without fear of censure or retribution.","Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) present with a highly diverse set of challenges, disabilities, impairments and strengths.

"Very little is known about autistic adults as they age. Early evidence suggests a potentially high risk for dementia and atypical cognitive decline in autistic middle and older age adults. Research in the general population indicates that self-reported cognitive decline may predict future dementia earlier than performance-based measures. Nevertheless, self-report dementia screeners have not been used to date in autism research. In a sample of middle and older age autistic adults (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;210), participants completed a self-rated dementia screener, the AD8, to describe the rate of cognitive decline, examine associations of cognitive decline with age, educational level, sex designated at birth, and autistic traits, and document the psychometrics of a dementia screener in autistic adults. We found high rates of cognitive decline with 30% of the sample screening positive. The most common symptoms were declining interest in leisure activities, and increases in everyday problems with thinking, memory, and judgment. There was evidence that autistic individuals designated female at birth may be more vulnerable to cognitive decline than autistic individuals designated male at birth. Notably, reports of cognitive decline did not vary by age or educational level. Modestly elevated autistic traits were found in those screening positive versus negative for cognitive decline. Finally, the dementia screener showed good psychometrics, including convergent validity with an independent measure of current memory problems. These results could signal an emerging public health crisis in autistic adults as they age, and support the potential utility of self-report measures for early screening for cognitive decline in this population.","Very little is known about autistic adults as they age.

"Cognitive performances of autistic people vary widely. Therefore, previous group-based comparisons on cognitive aging in autistic adults might have overlooked those autistic adults that are particularly vulnerable for cognitive decline. Multivariate normative comparisons (MNC) statistically assess individual cognitive differences on the entire cognitive profile. Cognitive deviancy as indicated by MNC accurately predicts future cognitive decline, and is therefore sensitive in detecting meaningful cognitive differences. The current study aimed to (1) investigate the applicability of MNC to assess cognitive performance in autism individually, and (2) understand heterogeneous cognitive performance in autistic adults. As pre-registered, we performed MNC in a sample of 254 non-autistic adults, and two independent samples of respectively 118, and 86 autistic adults (20-85&#x2009;years, mean: 50&#x2009;years). Cognitive performance was measured on 11 outcomes in six domains (verbal/visual memory, working memory, verbal fluency, Theory of Mind, and psychomotor speed). Using MNC, about twice as many autistic individuals had a deviant cognitive profile (i.e., deviated statistically from the multivariate normspace) as compared to non-autistic individuals. Importantly, most autistic individuals (&gt;80%) did not have a deviant cognitive profile. Having a deviant profile was significantly associated with higher levels of psychological distress in autistic adults specifically, showing the clinical relevance of this method. Therefore, MNC seem a useful tool to individually detect meaningful cognitive differences in autism. These results are consistent with previous cognitive studies suggesting that most autistic adults show fairly similar cognitive profiles to non-autistic adults, yet highlight the necessity for approaches reflecting the heterogeneity observed in autistic people.","Cognitive performances of autistic people vary widely.

"While theory supports bidirectional effects between caregiver sensitivity and language use, and infant language acquisition-both caregiver-to-infant and also infant-to-caregiver effects-empirical research has chiefly explored the former unidirectional path. In the context of infants showing early signs of autism, we investigated prospective bidirectional associations with 6-min free-play interaction samples collected for 103 caregivers and their infants (mean age 12-months; and followed up 6-months later). We anticipated that measures of caregiver sensitivity/language input and infant language would show within-domain temporal stability/continuity, but also that there would be predictive associations from earlier caregiver input to subsequent child language, and vice versa. Caregiver sensitive responsiveness (from the Manchester Assessment of Caregiver-Infant interaction [MACI]) predicted subsequent infant word tokens (i.e., amount of language, coded following the Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts [SALT]). Further, earlier infant Mean Length of Utterance (MLU; reflecting language complexity, also derived from SALT coding) predicted later caregiver MLU, even when controlling for variability in infant ages and clear within-domain temporal stability/continuity in key measures (i.e., caregiver sensitive responsiveness and infant word tokens; and infant and caregiver MLU). These data add empirical support to theorization on how caregiver input can be both supportive of, and potentially influenced by, infant capacities, when infants have social-communication differences and/or communication/language delays suggestive of possible emerging autism.","While theory supports bidirectional effects between caregiver sensitivity and language use, and infant language acquisition-both caregiver-to-infant and also infant-to-caregiver effects-empirical research has chiefly explored the former unidirectional path.

"Tanc2 is a large multi-domain postsynaptic scaffold protein mainly expressed in the brain. In humans, tanc2 mutations have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other related neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the role of tanc2 in neurodevelopment and in controlling behaviors are not fully understood. Here, we generated and characterized a tanc2 knockout allele in zebrafish. Loss of tanc2 increases the larval brain size and body length by promoting proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. We observed that the glutamatergic neuron population is significantly increased in tanc2 mutants while the GABAergic and the glycinergic neurons are not affected, suggesting that an excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance. Indeed, the tanc2 knockout larvae exhibited increase sleep. In adult zebrafish, the mutants display anxiolytic-behavior, reduced aggression, and impaired social preference. The alterations in these behaviors are phenotypically similar to the ASD patients carrying tanc2 mutations. Therefore, the tanc2 knockout allele could serve as a valuable model to further study the role of tanc2 in the nervous system.","Tanc2 is a large multi-domain postsynaptic scaffold protein mainly expressed in the brain.

"Autistic people experience the sensory world differently, impacting behavior. First-hand accounts and group-based research have found that sensory differences impact a range of things including family life, anxiety, participation, and daily living. Early sensory differences are widely reported to be associated with a cascade of developmental difference, suggesting that early autism diagnosis and sensory mapping could enable the provision of supports to facilitate flourishing. However, appropriate measurement tools are not available as all rely on proxy report or are observation measures which include limited modalities or domains and require the administration of stimuli. Therefore, following the gold-standard recommendations for measurement development outlined by the PROMIS&#xae; framework, we created the Sensory Observation Autism Rating scale (SOAR). We identified sensory behaviors across all primary domains and modalities through an extensive autism-sensory literature review and from focus groups with autism stakeholders. The initial item bank was then refined by an expert panel and through video coding five-minutes of free play from Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule assessments of 105 age- and gender-matched autistic and developmentally delayed children (aged 13-36&#x2009;months; 38 female). An additional 25% of the sample were double coded to investigate interrater reliability. Observational data and expert review supported the reduction of the item bank to 37 items. We propose that the refined SOAR has excellent face and ecological validity, along with interrater reliability (Intraclass correlation&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.87-0.99). Following further data collection and refinement, SOAR has promise to fully characterize sensory behaviors in autistic children and indicate useful supports.","Autistic people experience the sensory world differently, impacting behavior.

"Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other chronic health conditions often face exceptional caregiving demands that can lead to challenges related to maintaining and succeeding in employment. Detailed information on the specific ways in which these health conditions impact parent employment could aid in designing equitable, effective policies to support families. The r-Kids study used electronic health records to identify three groups of children: those with ASD, asthma, or neither condition (control), from several health care systems. We oversampled racial and ethnic minorities and matched the asthma and control groups to the age and sex distribution of the ASD group. Parents completed three online surveys over the course of a year to measure annual employment outcomes. Surveys included the Family Economic Impact Inventory (measuring employment impacts) and measures of quality of life and symptom severity. All materials were provided in English and Spanish. The study enrolled 1461 families (564 ASD, 468 asthma, 429 control). Youth were 3-16.5&#x2009;years old and predominantly male (79%). The sample was diverse (43% non-Hispanic White; 35% non-Hispanic Asian, Black, Native Hawaiian, or Other; and 21% Hispanic ethnicity). Parents of children with ASD were significantly less likely to be employed than parents of youth with asthma and control combined (OR: 14.2, p&#xa0;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and were more likely to have other difficulties with employment and productivity while at work. Public and employer policies to help mitigate these impacts could aid families in managing care for youth with ASD.","Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other chronic health conditions often face exceptional caregiving demands that can lead to challenges related to maintaining and succeeding in employment.

"Fine motor skill is associated with expressive language outcomes in infants who have an autistic sibling and in young autistic children. Fewer studies have focused on school-aged children even though around 80% have motor impairments and 30% remain minimally verbal (MV) into their school years. Moreover, expressive language is not a unitary construct, but it is made up of components such as speech production, structural language, and social-pragmatic language use. We used natural language sampling to investigate the relationship between fine motor and speech intelligibility, mean length of utterance and conversational turns in MV and verbal autistic children between the ages of 4 and 7 while controlling for age and adaptive behavior. Fine motor skill predicted speech production, measured by percent intelligible utterances. Fine motor skill and adaptive behavior predicted structural language, measured by mean length of utterance in morphemes. Adaptive behavior, but not fine motor skill, predicted social-pragmatic language use measured by number of conversational turns. Simple linear regressions by group corrected for multiple comparisons showed that fine motor skill predicted intelligibility for MV but not verbal children. Fine motor skill and adaptive behavior predicted mean length of utterance for both MV and verbal children. These findings suggest that future studies should explore whether MV children may benefit from interventions targeting fine motor along with speech and language into their school years.","Fine motor skill is associated with expressive language outcomes in infants who have an autistic sibling and in young autistic children.

"Although genes have long been appreciated to play a critical role in determining the risk for pervasive developmental disorders, the specific transcripts contributing to autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been quite difficult to characterize. However, recent findings are now providing the first insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these syndromes and have begun to shed light on the allelic architecture of ASD. In this article, we address what is known about the relative contributions of various types of genetic variation to ASD, consider the obstacles facing gene discovery in this complex disorder, and evaluate the common methodologies employed to address these issues, including linkage, molecular and array-based cytogenetics, and association strategies. We review the current literature, highlighting recent findings implicating both rare mutations and common genetic polymorphisms in the etiology of autism. Finally, we describe key advances in genomic technologies that are transforming all areas of human genetics and consider both the opportunities and challenges for autism research posed by these rapid changes.","Although genes have long been appreciated to play a critical role in determining the risk for pervasive developmental disorders, the specific transcripts contributing to autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been quite difficult to characterize.

"In the current study we explored the hypothesis that rare variants in SLC6A4 contribute to autism susceptibility and to rigid-compulsive behaviors in autism. We made use of a large number of unrelated cases with autism spectrum disorders (approximately 350) and controls (approximately 420) and screened for rare exonic variants in SLC6A4 by a high-throughput method followed by sequencing. We observed no difference in the frequency of such variants in the two groups, irrespective of how we defined the rare variants. Furthermore, we did not observe an association of rare coding variants in SLC6A4 with rigid-compulsive traits scores in the cases.

"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most commonly known genetic disorder associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Overlapping features in these populations include gaze aversion, communication deficits, and social withdrawal. Although the association between FXS and ASD has been well documented at the behavioral level, the underlying neural mechanisms associated with the social/emotional deficits in these groups remain unclear. We collected functional brain images and eye-gaze fixations from 9 individuals with FXS and 14 individuals with idiopathic ASD, as well as 15 typically developing (TD) individuals, while they performed a facial-emotion discrimination task. The FXS group showed a similar yet less aberrant pattern of gaze fixations compared with the ASD group. The FXS group also showed fusiform gyrus (FG) hypoactivation compared with the TD control group. Activation in FG was strongly and positively associated with average eye fixation and negatively associated with ASD characteristics in the FXS group. The FXS group displayed significantly greater activation than both the TD control and ASD groups in the left hippocampus (HIPP), left superior temporal gyrus (STG), right insula (INS), and left postcentral gyrus (PCG). These group differences in brain activation are important as they suggest unique underlying face-processing neural circuitry in FXS versus idiopathic ASD, largely supporting the hypothesis that ASD characteristics in FXS and idiopathic ASD reflect partially divergent impairments at the neural level, at least in FXS individuals without a co-morbid diagnosis of ASD.","Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most commonly known genetic disorder associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

"To assess the feasibility and relevance of using lymphoblastoid cell lines to study the role of noncoding RNAs in the etiology of autism, we evaluated global expression profiling of 470 mature human microRNAs from six subjects with autism compared with six matched controls. Differential expression (either higher or lower) for 9 of the 470 microRNAs was observed in our autism samples compared with controls. Potential target genes for these microRNAs were identified using computer tools, which included several autism susceptibility genes. Our preliminary results indicate microRNAs should be considered and evaluated in the etiology of autism. In addition, analysis of this class of noncoding RNAs in lymphoblastoid cells has the potential to reveal at least a subset of brain-related microRNAs implicated in autism. Subsequently, this model system should allow for detection of complex subtle changes in susceptibility genes/pathways contributing to autism.","To assess the feasibility and relevance of using lymphoblastoid cell lines to study the role of noncoding RNAs in the etiology of autism, we evaluated global expression profiling of 470 mature human microRNAs from six subjects with autism compared with six matched controls.","Differential expression (either higher or lower) for 9 of the 470 microRNAs was observed in our autism samples compared with controls.

"Adults with autism exhibit inhibitory deficits that are often manifested in behavioral modifications, such as repetitive behaviors, and/or sensory hyper-responsiveness. If such behaviors are the result of a generalized deficiency in inhibitory neurotransmission, then it stands to reason that deficits involving localized cortical-cortical interactions--such as in sensory discrimination tasks--could be detected and quantified. This study exemplifies a newly developed method for quantifying sensory testing metrics. Our novel sensory discrimination tests may provide (a) an effective means for biobehavioral assessment of deficits specific to autism and (b) an efficient and sensitive measure of change following treatment. The sensory discriminative capacity of ten subjects with autism and ten controls was compared both before and after short duration adapting stimuli. Specifically, vibrotactile amplitude discriminative capacity was obtained both in the presence and absence of 1 sec adapting stimuli that were delivered 1 sec prior to the comparison stimuli. Although adaptation had a pronounced effect on the amplitude discriminative capacity of the control subjects, little or no impact was observed on the sensory discriminative capacity of the subjects with autism. This lack of impact of the adapting stimuli on the responses of the subjects with autism was interpreted to be consistent with the reduced GABAergic-mediated inhibition described in previous reports. One significant aspect of this study is that the methods could prove to be a useful and efficient way to detect specific neural deficits and monitor the efficacy of pharmacological or behavioral treatments in autism.","Adults with autism exhibit inhibitory deficits that are often manifested in behavioral modifications, such as repetitive behaviors, and/or sensory hyper-responsiveness.

"Many children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) acquire a sizeable lexicon. However, these children also seem to understand and/or store the meanings of words differently from typically developing children. One of the mechanisms that helps typically developing children learn novel words is the shape bias, in which the referent of a noun is mapped onto the shape of an object, rather than onto its color, texture, or size. We hypothesized that children with autistic disorder would show reduced or absent shape bias. Using the intermodal preferential looking paradigm , we compared the performance of young children with ASD and typically developing children (TYP), across four time points, in their use of shape bias. Neither group showed a shape bias at Visit 1, when half of the children in both groups produced fewer than 50 count nouns. Only the TYP group showed a shape bias at Visits 2, 3, and 4. According to the growth curve analyses, the rate of increase in the shape bias scores over time was significant for the TYP children. The fact that the TYP group showed a shape bias at 24 months of age, whereas children with ASD did not demonstrate a shape bias despite a sizeable vocabulary, supports a dissociation between vocabulary size and principles governing acquisition in ASD children from early in language development.","Many children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) acquire a sizeable lexicon.

"Although circumscribed interests are a hallmark characteristic of autism spectrum disorders, providing a means for quantifying their functional impairment has proven difficult. We developed a passive viewing task to measure aspects of visual attention in children with autism spectrum disorders and typically developing controls. Task stimuli included picture arrays that were matched for social and nonsocial content. Nonsocial content was balanced to include items related to circumscribed interests (e.g., trains) as well as more commonplace items (e.g., furniture). Discrete aspects of gaze behavior were quantified using eye-tracking technology. Results indicate that visual attention in the autism group was more circumscribed (as indicated by the exploration of fewer images), more perseverative (as indicated by longer fixation times per image explored), and more detail oriented (as indicated by a greater number of discrete fixations on explored images). This pattern of results was similar for both social and object arrays. Within the autism group, overall severity of repetitive behavior symptoms correlated positively with exploration of object pictures and negatively with perseveration on social pictures. Results suggest that children with autism have a domain-general pattern of atypical visual attention that may represent an exaggeration of a typical attentional process and is related to a tendency to perseverate on images of interest and explore them in a more detail-oriented manner. Discrete measures of visual attention may therefore provide a reasonable means of quantifying aspects of the repetitive behavior phenotype in autism.","Although circumscribed interests are a hallmark characteristic of autism spectrum disorders, providing a means for quantifying their functional impairment has proven difficult.","We developed a passive viewing task to measure aspects of visual attention in children with autism spectrum disorders and typically developing controls.

"Since the 1970s, the prevalence of multiple births (MBs) in the United States has increased significantly. This has been attributed, in large part, to iatrogenic MBs resulting from infertility treatments that include ovulation stimulation. A past study has indicated that children from MBs have an increased prevalence of cerebral palsy (CP). Other studies also have suggested an association between MBs and intellectual disabilities (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs); however, results have been inconsistent. From the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network, a surveillance project among several US populations, we obtained MB estimates among children born in 1994 and classified by 8 years of age as having: an ASD (n=1,626 total children from 11 sites; 50 born as part of an MB); CP (n=302 total children from 3 sites; 25 born as part of an MB); or ID (n=1,195 total children from 3 sites; 45 born as part of an MB). All three MB estimates were notably higher than age-adjusted expected estimates of naturally conceived MBs derived from 1971 US natality data. However, when MB estimates from the ADDM Network were compared with expected MB estimates derived from 1994 natality data for the states corresponding to the relevant ADDM Network sites, we observed no association with ASDs (observed/expected=1.08 [0.78-1.38]), a moderate, but not statistically significant association with ID (observed/expected=1.34 [0.95-1.73]), and a strong association with CP (observed/expected=2.96 [1.80-4.12]). Further investigation of specific types of MBs (natural vs. iatrogenic) is warranted.","Since the 1970s, the prevalence of multiple births (MBs) in the United States has increased significantly.

"Autism and specific language impairment (SLI) are developmental disorders that, although distinct by definition, have in common some features of both language and social behavior. The goal of this study was to further explore the extent to which specific clinical features of autism are seen in SLI. The children with the two disorders, matched for non-verbal IQ, were compared on the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). In the SLI group, 41% met autism or autism spectrum cut-offs for social or communication domains either on the ADI or ADOS or both. No relationship was found between the language deficits exhibited by the children with SLI and their scores on the ADI and ADOS. These findings contribute to evidence that there is some overlap in social and communicative deficits between autism and SLI, supporting the view that autism and SLI share etiologic factors. This continuum of pathology between SLI and autism appears to range from structural language abnormalities as seen in individuals with SLI to individuals with SLI with both structural and social abnormalities to individuals with autism with pragmatic impairment and language abnormalities.","Autism and specific language impairment (SLI) are developmental disorders that, although distinct by definition, have in common some features of both language and social behavior.

"Previous research has found that in typically developing individuals, behavioral performance declines and electrophysiological brain responses are altered when the face is inverted. Such effects are generally attributed to disruption of configural information. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been found to show less pronounced inversion effects, a result in line with the view that featural processing of faces is enhanced in ASD. No study has determined if, or how, such local bias is reflected in the eye movements used in face observation. In this eye tracking study, looking time and pupil dilation were investigated during the presentation of upright and inverted faces in preschool children with ASD and typically developing preschoolers. On average, both children with ASD and typically developing children looked less at the face and the eye areas during inverted presentations than during upright presentations. Nevertheless, individuals with ASD had a stronger tendency than typically developing children to look at the same face features during upright and inverted presentations, which is suggestive of a local bias. Pupil dilation, reflecting increased processing load, was larger for inverted than upright faces in the ASD group only, and pupillary inversion effects were stronger in ASD than in typically developing children.","Previous research has found that in typically developing individuals, behavioral performance declines and electrophysiological brain responses are altered when the face is inverted.

"The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) is a quantitative measure of autistic traits in 4- to 18-year-olds, which has been used in behavior-genetic, epidemiological and intervention studies. The US standardization demonstrated a single-factor structure and good to excellent psychometric properties. The cross-cultural validity of the German adaptation of the parent-report SRS in a sample of N=1,436 children and adolescents: 838 typically developing and 527 clinical participants (160 with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)) was examined. Internal consistency (0.91-0.97), test-retest reliability (0.84-0.97), interrater reliability (0.76 and 0.95) and convergent validity with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule as well as the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and Social Communication Questionnaire (0.35-0.58) were satisfactory to good. The SRS total score discriminated between ASD and other mental disorders. SRS scores proved to be sufficiently independent of general psychopathology. Principal component analyses yielded single-factor solutions for the normative and clinical subsamples. In addition, construct validity was ensured by consistent correlations with the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, the Child Behavior Checklist and the Junior Temperament and Character Inventory. Normative SRS total scores for girls and boys as well as values for ASD were lower in the German sample, while scores for conduct disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity/conduct disorder combined were higher. Generally, cross-cultural validity of the SRS seems to be sufficiently assured for a large European sample. However, some discrepancies regarding SRS normative and clinical raw score distributions, reliability and validity findings are critically discussed.","The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) is a quantitative measure of autistic traits in 4- to 18-year-olds, which has been used in behavior-genetic, epidemiological and intervention studies.

"Previous conceptualizations of autism have suggested that symptoms are evident either early in the first year of life or later in the second year, after a loss of previously acquired skills. New research suggests, however, that these two patterns do not capture all the different ways autism can emerge. For example, some children show a developmental plateau marked by failure to progress, while other children display mixed features, with both early delays and later losses evident. This article reviews the literature on autism onset, discusses problems with the traditional ways in which onset has been conceptualized, and provides recommendations for future research. We suggest that onset is better thought of as a dimensional process rather than dichotomous categories.","Previous conceptualizations of autism have suggested that symptoms are evident either early in the first year of life or later in the second year, after a loss of previously acquired skills.

"Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a triad of complications. Autistic individuals display significant disturbances in language and reciprocal social interactions, combined with repetitive and stereotypic behaviors. Prevalence studies suggest that autism is more common than originally believed, with recent estimates citing a rate of one in 150. Although multiple genetic linkage and association studies have yielded multiple suggestive genes or chromosomal regions, a specific risk locus has yet to be identified and widely confirmed. Because many etiologies have been suggested for this complex syndrome, we hypothesize that one of the difficulties in identifying autism genes is that multiple genetic variants may be required to significantly increase the risk of developing autism. Thus, we took the alternative approach of examining 14 prominent dopamine pathway candidate genes for detailed study by genotyping 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Although we did observe a nominally significant association for rs2239535 (P=0.008) on chromosome 20, single-locus analysis did not reveal any results as significant after correction for multiple comparisons. No significant interaction was identified when Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction was employed to test specifically for multilocus effects. Although genome-wide linkage scans in autism have provided support for linkage to various loci along the dopamine pathway, our study does not provide strong evidence of linkage or association to any specific gene or combination of genes within the pathway. These results demonstrate that common genetic variation within the tested genes located within this pathway at most play a minor to moderate role in overall autism pathogenesis.","Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a triad of complications.

"Although it has been well established that individuals with autism exhibit difficulties in their face recognition abilities, it has been debated whether this deficit reflects a category-specific impairment of faces or a general perceptual bias toward the local-level information in a stimulus. In this study, the Let's Face It! Skills Battery [Tanaka &amp; Schultz, 2008] of developmental face- and object-processing measures was administered to a large sample of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically developing children. The main finding was that when matched for age and IQ, individuals with ASD were selectively impaired in their ability to recognize faces across changes in orientation, expression and featural information. In a face discrimination task, ASD participants showed a preserved ability to discriminate featural and configural information in the mouth region of a face, but were compromised in their ability to discriminate featural and configural information in the eyes. On object-processing tasks, ASD participants demonstrated a normal ability to recognize automobiles across changes in orientation and a superior ability to discriminate featural and configural information in houses. These findings indicate that the face-processing deficits in ASD are not due to a local-processing bias, but reflect a category-specific impairment of faces characterized by a failure to form view-invariant face representations and discriminate information in the eye region of the face.","Although it has been well established that individuals with autism exhibit difficulties in their face recognition abilities, it has been debated whether this deficit reflects a category-specific impairment of faces or a general perceptual bias toward the local-level information in a stimulus.","In this study, the Let's Face It!

"The impaired development of joint attention is a cardinal feature of autism. Therefore, understanding the nature of joint attention is central to research on this disorder. Joint attention may be best defined in terms of an information-processing system that begins to develop by 4-6 months of age. This system integrates the parallel processing of internal information about one's own visual attention with external information about the visual attention of other people. This type of joint encoding of information about self and other attention requires the activation of a distributed anterior and posterior cortical attention network. Genetic regulation, in conjunction with self-organizing behavioral activity, guides the development of functional connectivity in this network. With practice in infancy the joint processing of self-other attention becomes automatically engaged as an executive function. It can be argued that this executive joint attention is fundamental to human learning as well as the development of symbolic thought, social cognition and social competence throughout the life span. One advantage of this parallel and distributed-processing model of joint attention is that it directly connects theory on social pathology to a range of phenomena in autism associated with neural connectivity, constructivist and connectionist models of cognitive development, early intervention, activity-dependent gene expression and atypical ocular motor control.","The impaired development of joint attention is a cardinal feature of autism.

"The laterally positioned dentate nuclei lie in a key position in the cerebellum to receive input from Purkinje cells in the lateral cerebellar hemisphere participating in both motor and cognitive functions. Although neuropathology of the four cerebellar nuclei using Nissl staining has been qualitatively reported in children and adults with autism, surprisingly the dentate nuclei appeared less affected despite reported reductions in Purkinje cells in the posterolateral cerebellar hemisphere. To determine any underlying abnormalities in the critically important GABAergic system, the rate-limiting GABA synthesizing enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) type 65 was measured via in situ hybridization histochemistry in dentate somata. GAD65 mRNA labeling revealed two distinct subpopulations of neurons in adult control and autism postmortem brains: small-sized cells (about 10-12 microm in diameter, presumed interneurons) and larger-sized neurons (about 18-20 microm in diameter, likely feedback to inferior olivary neurons). A mean 51% reduction in GAD65 mRNA levels was found in the larger labeled cells in the autistic group compared with the control group (P=0.009; independent t-test) but not in the smaller cell subpopulation. This suggests a disturbance in the intrinsic cerebellar circuitry in the autism group potentially interfering with the synchronous firing of inferior olivary neurons, and the timing of Purkinje cell firing and inputs to the dentate nuclei. Disturbances in critical neural substrates within these key circuits could disrupt afferents to motor and/or cognitive cerebral association areas in the autistic brain likely contributing to the marked behavioral consequences characteristic of autism.","The laterally positioned dentate nuclei lie in a key position in the cerebellum to receive input from Purkinje cells in the lateral cerebellar hemisphere participating in both motor and cognitive functions.

"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and specific language impairment (SLI) are developmental disorders exhibiting language deficits, but it is unclear whether they arise from similar etiologies. Language impairments have been described in family members of children with ASD and SLI, but few studies have quantified them. In this study, we examined IQ, language, and reading abilities of ASD and SLI children and their first-degree relatives to address whether the language difficulties observed in some children with ASD are familial and to better understand the degree of overlap between these disorders and their broader phenotypes. Participants were 52 autistic children, 36 children with SLI, their siblings, and their parents. The ASD group was divided into those with (ALI, n=32) and without (ALN, n=20) language impairment. Relationships between ASD severity and language performance were also examined in the ASD probands. ALI and SLI probands performed similarly on most measures while ALN probands scored higher. ALN and ALI probands' language scores were not related to Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule algorithm scores. SLI relatives scored lowest on all measures, and while scores were not in the impaired range, relatives of ALI children scored lower than relatives of ALN children on some measures, though not those showing highest heritability in SLI. Given that ALI relatives performed better than SLI relatives across the language measures, the hypothesis that ALI and SLI families share similar genetic loading for language is not strongly supported.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and specific language impairment (SLI) are developmental disorders exhibiting language deficits, but it is unclear whether they arise from similar etiologies.

"Previously we reported that children with autism show significant variability in cortisol. The current investigation was designed to extend these findings by exploring plausible relationships between cortisol and psychological measures of stress and sensory functioning. Salivary cortisol values for diurnal rhythms and response to stress in children with and without autism were compared to parent-report measures of child stress, the Stress Survey Schedule (SSS), sensory functioning, Short Sensory Profile (SSP), and Parenting Stress Index. In autism, a negative relationship between morning cortisol and the SSS revealed that higher observed symptoms of stress were related to lower cortisol. Lower cortisol is seen in conditions of chronic stress and in social situations characterized by unstable social relationships. Sensory sensitivity painted a more complicated picture, in that some aspects of SSP were associated with higher while others were associated with lower cortisol. We propose that increased sensory sensitivity may enhance the autistic child's susceptibility to the influence of zeitgeibers reflected in variable cortisol secretion. Evening cortisol was positively associated with SSS such that the higher the level of evening cortisol, the higher the child's parent-reported daily stress, especially to changes, such as in daily routine. Regarding the response to stress, the psychological and parent variables did not differentiate the groups; rather, discrete subgroups of cortisol responders and nonresponders were revealed in both the autism and neurotypical children. The results support a complex interplay between physiological and behavioral stress and sensory sensitivity in autism and plausible developmental factors influencing stress reactivity across the groups.",Previously we reported that children with autism show significant variability in cortisol.

"Previous studies found substantial variability in adult outcome for people with autism whose cognitive functioning was within the near-average and average ranges. This study examined adult outcome for 41 such individuals (38 men and 3 women) originally identified through an epidemiological survey of autism in Utah. Mean age at the time of their previous cognitive assessment was 7.2 years (SD=4.1, range=3.1-25.9 years) and at follow-up was 32.5 years (SD=5.7 years, range=22.3-46.4 years). Outcome measures included standardized assessments of diagnostic status, cognitive ability, and adaptive behavior. Additional information collected concerned demographic variables, indicators of independence, social relationships, medical and psychiatric conditions, and social service use. Outcomes for this sample were better than outcomes described in previous work on individuals with similar cognitive functioning.

"The nature and extent of face-processing impairments in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain contentious. The aim of this research study is to assess the face- and object-processing performance of individuals with ASD compared with typically developing controls. Our hypothesis was that individuals with ASD would be significantly impaired on tests of face processing but show intact object processing. More specifically, we tested two competing hypotheses to explain face-processing deficits: holistic hypothesis; second-order configural hypothesis. Twenty-six able adults with ASD and 26 intelligence quotient-matched typically developing controls completed two computerized tests of face and object discrimination. In task 1, the first picture (faces or cars) in a pair was presented as quickly as 40 msec to test holistic processing. In task 2, the decision was whether pairs of faces or houses had been altered in terms of the features or the distance between the features (the second-order configural properties). Individuals with ASD were impaired on all tests of face processing but showed intact object processing and the pattern of findings favored the holistic hypothesis. The heterogeneous pattern of performance in the clinical group showed that some individuals with ASD perform similarly to typically developing individuals in their face-processing skills, whereas others are more accurate in object processing compared with face processing.","The nature and extent of face-processing impairments in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain contentious.

"New evidence suggests that autism may be associated with (a) varied behavioral responses to folate therapy and (b) metabolic anomalies, including those in folate metabolism, that contribute to hypomethylation of DNA. We hypothesized that children with autism who are homozygous for the MTHFR 677 T allele (TT) and, to a lesser extent those with the CT variant, would exhibit more behavioral problems and/or more severe problematic behaviors than homozygous wild-type (CC) individuals because of difficulties in effectively converting 5,10-MTHF to 5-MTHF. Data from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) collection were analyzed for all children who met strict criteria for autism per the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and who had been genotyped for the 677 C to T MTHFR polymorphism (n=147). Chi-square tests, logistic regression, and one-way ANOVAs were used to determine whether differences existed among MTHFR genotypes for specific behaviors on the ADI-R and indices for level of functioning. Exploratory results indicated four behaviors from the ADI-R that were more common and problematic (95% CI) among those with at least one copy of the T allele as compared to homozygous wild-type individuals: direct gaze, current complex body movements, a history of self-injurious behavior, and current overactivity (ORs=2.72, 2.33, 2.12, 2.47, respectively). No differences existed among genotypes for level of functioning as measured with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Third Edition, Ravens Colored Progressive Matrices, or the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales. Findings call for further investigation of the relationship between folate metabolism and problem behaviors among children with autism.","New evidence suggests that autism may be associated with (a) varied behavioral responses to folate therapy and (b) metabolic anomalies, including those in folate metabolism, that contribute to hypomethylation of DNA.

"Heterogeneity in phenotypic presentation of Autism spectrum disorders has been cited as one explanation for the difficulty in pinpointing specific genes involved in autism. Recent studies have attempted to reduce the ""noise"" in genetic and other biological data by reducing the phenotypic heterogeneity of the sample population. The current study employs multiple clustering algorithms on 123 item scores from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) diagnostic instrument of nearly 2,000 autistic individuals to identify subgroups of autistic probands with clinically relevant behavioral phenotypes in order to isolate more homogeneous groups of subjects for gene expression analyses. Our combined cluster analyses suggest optimal division of the autistic probands into four phenotypic clusters based on similarity of symptom severity across the 123 selected item scores. One cluster is characterized by severe language deficits, while another exhibits milder symptoms across the domains. A third group possesses a higher frequency of savant skills while the fourth group exhibited intermediate severity across all domains. Grouping autistic individuals by multivariate cluster analysis of ADI-R scores reveals meaningful phenotypes of subgroups within the autistic spectrum, which we show, in a related (accompanying) study, to be associated with distinct gene expression profiles.",Heterogeneity in phenotypic presentation of Autism spectrum disorders has been cited as one explanation for the difficulty in pinpointing specific genes involved in autism.

"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by delayed/abnormal language development, deficits in social interaction, repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. The heterogeneity in clinical presentation of ASD, likely due to different etiologies, complicates genetic/biological analyses of these disorders. DNA microarray analyses were conducted on 116 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) from individuals with idiopathic autism who are divided into three phenotypic subgroups according to severity scores from the commonly used Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised questionnaire and age-matched, nonautistic controls. Statistical analyses of gene expression data from control LCL against that of LCL from ASD probands identify genes for which expression levels are either quantitatively or qualitatively associated with phenotypic severity. Comparison of the significant differentially expressed genes from each subgroup relative to the control group reveals differentially expressed genes unique to each subgroup as well as genes in common across subgroups. Among the findings unique to the most severely affected ASD group are 15 genes that regulate circadian rhythm, which has been shown to have multiple effects on neurological as well as metabolic functions commonly dysregulated in autism. Among the genes common to all three subgroups of ASD are 20 novel genes mostly in putative noncoding regions, which appear to associate with androgen sensitivity and which may underlie the strong 4:1 bias toward affected males.","Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by delayed/abnormal language development, deficits in social interaction, repetitive behaviors and restricted interests.

"The executive function (EF) theory of autism has received much support recently from a growing number of studies. However, executive impairments have not always been easy to identify consistently and so novel ""ecologically valid"" tests have been designed which tap into real-life scenarios that are relevant to and representative of everyday behavior. One characteristic of many of these tasks is that they present the participant with an ""ill-structured"" or ""open-ended"" situation. Here, we investigated the possibility that tasks with greater degrees of open-endedness might prove more sensitive to detecting executive impairment in autism. Forty-five children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were compared to 27 age- and IQ-matched control children on a range of cognitive tests of EF. Group differences were found on half of the tasks, with the greatest degree of impairment detected on the more open-ended tasks. The ASD group also performed more poorly on a simple control condition of a task. Detailed consideration of task performance suggested that the ASD group tended to create fewer spontaneous strategies and exhibit more idiosyncratic behavior, which particularly disadvantaged them on the more open-ended tasks. These kinds of behaviors have been reported in studies of neurological patients with frontal lobe involvement, prima facie suggesting a link between the scientific fields. However, we suggest that this behavior might equally result from a poor understanding of the implicit demands made by the experimenter in open-ended test situations, due to the socio-communicative difficulties of these children.","The executive function (EF) theory of autism has received much support recently from a growing number of studies.

"People with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) have difficulties with mentalizing, empathy, and narrative comprehension. A new test of social and narrative cognition, the Moral Dilemmas Film Task, was developed to probe individuals' spontaneous understanding of naturalistic film scenes. Twenty-eight individuals with ASC and 28 neurotypical controls, matched for age, sex, and IQ, watched four short emotionally charged film clips each depicting a moral dilemma, and were asked to write about what they had seen. Individuals with ASC produced significantly shorter film-based narratives and showed a smaller bias for mental states over objects in their narratives than controls. A significant correlation was found between verbal IQ and the level of mentalizing in film narratives for the ASC group, but not the control group, while the reverse pattern was found with a measure of self-reported cognitive and affective empathy. These results suggest that to the extent that both groups succeed in viewing moral dilemmas in terms of mental content, they do so in different ways, with individuals with ASC using verbal scaffolding to increase their ability to draw meaning from social scenes. The well-established empathy deficit in ASC extends to spontaneous interpretation of moral dilemmas. This new film task has the potential to assay different aspects of how the social world is represented differently in ASC, including during moral comprehension.","People with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) have difficulties with mentalizing, empathy, and narrative comprehension.","A new test of social and narrative cognition, the Moral Dilemmas Film Task, was developed to probe individuals' spontaneous understanding of naturalistic film scenes.

"A new social distance judgment task was used to measure quantitatively the extent to which social cues are immediately and involuntary interpreted by typically developing (TD) individuals and by individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The task thus tapped into the ability to involuntary ""pick up"" the meaning of social cues. The cues tested were social attention and implied biological motion. Task performance of the ASD and TD groups was similarly affected by a perceptual low-level illusion induced by physical characteristics of the stimuli. In contrast, a high-level illusion induced by the implications of the social cues affected only the TD individuals; the ASD individuals remained unaffected (causing them to perform superior to TD controls). The results indicate that despite intact perceptual processing, the immediate involuntary interpretation of social cues can be compromised. We propose that this type of social cue understanding is a distinct process that should be differentiated from reflective social cue understanding and is specifically compromised in ASD. We discuss evidence for an underpinning neural substrate.",A new social distance judgment task was used to measure quantitatively the extent to which social cues are immediately and involuntary interpreted by typically developing (TD) individuals and by individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

"A previous study reported that fathers of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) were more likely to work as engineers, requiring ""systemizing skills,"" and suggesting a distinct phenotype, but alternatively this may have been related to selection biases. We conducted a population-based study to explore whether fathers, or mothers, of children with ASD are over-represented in fields requiring highly technical skills. Subjects included 284 children with ASD and 659 gender-matched controls, born in 1994 in the San Francisco Bay Area. Parental occupation and industry were abstracted verbatim from birth certificates. Engineering, computer programming, and science were examined as highly technical occupations. To limit bias by parental socio-economic status, we selected a referent group of occupations that seemed professionally similar but of a less technical nature. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by logistic regression, adjusting for parental age, education, and child race. Mothers of cases were somewhat more likely to work in hi-tech occupations (6.7%) than mothers of controls (4.0%, P=0.07), but little difference was observed among fathers, nor for engineering separately. Compared to parents in other ""white collar"" occupations, the adjusted OR for highly technical occupations among mothers was 2.5 (95% CI: 1.2-5.3) and among fathers was 1.3 (95% CI: 0.79-2.1), with no evidence of a joint effect observed. Our results regarding maternal occupation in technical fields being associated with ASD in offspring suggest further study to distinguish parental occupation as a phenotypic marker of genetic loading vs. other social or exposure factors.","A previous study reported that fathers of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) were more likely to work as engineers, requiring ""systemizing skills,"" and suggesting a distinct phenotype, but alternatively this may have been related to selection biases.","We conducted a population-based study to explore whether fathers, or mothers, of children with ASD are over-represented in fields requiring highly technical skills.

"The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; BA 24) via its extensive limbic and high order association cortical connectivity to prefrontal cortex is a key part of an important circuitry participating in executive function, affect, and socio-emotional behavior. Multiple lines of evidence, including genetic and imaging studies, suggest that the ACC and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) system may be affected in autism. The benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA(A) receptor complex is an important target for pharmacotherapy and has important clinical implications. The present multiple-concentration ligand-binding study utilized (3)H-muscimol and (3)H-flunitrazepam to determine the number (B(max)), binding affinity (K(d)), and distribution of GABA(A) receptors and benzodiazepine binding sites, respectively, in the ACC in adult autistic and control cases. Compared to controls, the autistic group had significant decreases in the mean density of GABA(A) receptors in the supragranular (46.8%) and infragranular (20.2%) layers of the ACC and in the density of benzodiazepine binding sites in the supragranular (28.9%) and infragranular (16.4%) lamina [corrected]. These findings suggest that in the autistic group this downregulation of both benzodiazepine sites and GABA(A) receptors in the ACC may be the result of increased GABA innervation and/or release disturbing the delicate excitation/inhibition balance of principal neurons as well as their output to key limbic cortical targets. Such disturbances likely underlie the core alterations in socio-emotional behaviors in autism.","The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; BA 24) via its extensive limbic and high order association cortical connectivity to prefrontal cortex is a key part of an important circuitry participating in executive function, affect, and socio-emotional behavior.

"Prototype formation is a critical skill for category learning. Research suggests that individuals with autism may have a deficit in prototype formation of some objects; however, results are mixed. This study used a natural category, faces, to further examine prototype formation in high-functioning individuals with autism. High-functioning children (age 8-13 years) and adults with autism (age 17-53 years) and matched controls were tested in a facial prototype formation task that has been used to test prototype formation abilities in typically developing infants and adults [Strauss, 1979]. Participants were familiarized to a series of faces depicting subtle variations in the spatial distance of facial features, and were then given a forced choice familiarity test between the mean prototype and the mode prototype. Overall, individuals in the autism group were significantly less likely to select the mean prototype face. Even though the children with autism showed this difference in prototype formation, this pattern was driven primarily by the adults, because the adults with autism were approximately four times less likely to select the mean prototype than were the control adults. These results provide further evidence that individuals with autism have difficulty abstracting subtle spatial information that is necessary not only for the formation of a mean prototype, but also for categorizing faces and objects.","Prototype formation is a critical skill for category learning.

"Chromosomal breaks and rearrangements have been observed in conjunction with autism and autistic spectrum disorders. A chromosomal inversion has been previously reported in autistic siblings, spanning the region from approximately 7q22.1 to 7q31. This family is distinguished by having multiple individuals with autism and associated disabilities. The region containing the inversion has been strongly implicated in autism by multiple linkage studies, and has been particularly associated with language defects in autism as well as in other disorders with language components. Mapping of the inversion breakpoints by FISH has localized the inversion to the region spanning approximately 99-108.75 Mb of chromosome 7. The proximal breakpoint has the potential to disrupt either the coding sequence or regulatory regions of a number of cytochrome P450 genes while the distal region falls in a relative gene desert. Copy number variant analysis of the breakpoint regions detected no duplication or deletion that could clearly be associated with disease status. Association analysis in our autism data set using single nucleotide polymorphisms located near the breakpoints showed no significant association with proximal breakpoint markers, but has identified markers near the distal breakpoint ( approximately 108-110 Mb) with significant associations to autism. The chromosomal abnormality in this family strengthens the case for an autism susceptibility gene in the chromosome 7q22-31 region and targets a candidate region for further investigation.","Chromosomal breaks and rearrangements have been observed in conjunction with autism and autistic spectrum disorders.

"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and postmortem neuropathological studies have implicated the cerebellum in the pathophysiology of autism. Controversy remains, however, concerning the nature and the consistency of cerebellar alterations. MRI studies of the cross-sectional area of the vermis have found both decreases and no difference in autism groups. Volumetric analysis of the vermis, which is less prone to ""plane of section artifacts"" may provide a more reliable assessment of size differences but few such studies exist in the literature. Here we present the results of a volumetric analysis of the structure of the whole cerebellum and its components in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders. Structural MRI's were acquired from 62 male participants (7.5 to 18.5 years-old) who met criteria for the following age-matched diagnostic groups: low functioning autism, high functioning autism (HFA), Asperger syndrome, and typically developing children. When compared to controls, the midsagittal area of the vermis, or of subgroups of lobules, was not reduced in any of the autism groups. However, we did find that total vermis volume was decreased in the combined autism group. When examined separately, the vermis of only the HFA group was significantly reduced compared to typically developing controls. Neither IQ nor age predicted the size of the vermis within the autism groups. There were no differences in the volume of individual vermal lobules or cerebellar hemispheres. These findings are discussed in relation to the pathology of autism and to the fairly common alterations of vermal morphology in various neurodevelopmental disorders.","Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and postmortem neuropathological studies have implicated the cerebellum in the pathophysiology of autism.

"In order to disentangle genetic and environmental contributions to cortical anomalies in children with autism, we investigated cortical folding patterns in a cohort of 14 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs who displayed a range of phenotypic discordance for autism, and 14 typically developing community controls. Cortical folding was assessed with the gyrification index, which was calculated on high resolution anatomic MR images. We found that the cortical folding patterns across most lobar regions of the cerebral cortex was highly discordant within MZ twin pairs. In addition, children with autism and their co-twins exhibited increased cortical folding in the right parietal lobe, relative to age- and gender-matched typical developing children. Increased folding in the right parietal lobe was associated with more symptoms of autism for co-twins. Finally, the robust association between cortical folding and IQ observed in typical children was not observed in either children with autism or their co-twins. These findings, which contribute to our understanding of the limits of genetic liability in autism, suggest that anomalies in the structural integrity of the cortex in this PDD may disrupt the association between cortical folding and intelligence that has been reported in typical individuals, and may account, in part, for the deficits in visual spatial attention and in social cognition that have been reported in children with autism.","In order to disentangle genetic and environmental contributions to cortical anomalies in children with autism, we investigated cortical folding patterns in a cohort of 14 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs who displayed a range of phenotypic discordance for autism, and 14 typically developing community controls.","Cortical folding was assessed with the gyrification index, which was calculated on high resolution anatomic MR images.","We found that the cortical folding patterns across most lobar regions of the cerebral cortex was highly discordant within MZ twin pairs.

"In a previous study on anxiety-related behaviours of the genetically and behaviourally distant inbred mouse strains C57BL/6 and BALB/c using the Elevated plus-maze (EPM) and Open-field (OF) apparatuses, we identified a number of variables, the factorial scores of which were grouped by principal component analysis (PCA) into factors specifically describing each inbred strain. We have now studied the effect of C57BL/6 and BALB/c haploid sets of genes on this behaviour by comparing EPM and OF variables of C57BL/6 and BALB/c versus C57BL/6 x BALB/c F1 hybrids (B6CBF1) and chimeric C57BL/6 x BALB/c (CHIM) mice. CHIM mice were made by embryo aggregation and the chimerism degree of their brain was inferred from coat black/white distribution. Discriminant analysis of EPM and OF factorial scores of C57BL/6, BALB/c and CHIM mice showed that CHIM mice with an exceeding (&gt; or =80%) C57BL/6 or BALB/c coat component had behaviours similar to those of the predominant strain, whereas CHIM mice with intermediate chimerism differed from both inbred strains. Additional MANOVA analysis showed that the anxiety behaviour of CHIM mice with intermediate chimerism was similar to that of B6CBF1 mice as for factors not describing the inbred strains, including a motor activity mostly limited to protected areas, with attempts to approach the anxiogenic areas while processing/storing the external information. We conclude that the balanced presence of both C57BL/6 and BALB/c genetic backgrounds, either when carried by the same cell or by different cells, gives rise to a novel stress coping strategy described by factors different from those of the inbred strains.","In a previous study on anxiety-related behaviours of the genetically and behaviourally distant inbred mouse strains C57BL/6 and BALB/c using the Elevated plus-maze (EPM) and Open-field (OF) apparatuses, we identified a number of variables, the factorial scores of which were grouped by principal component analysis (PCA) into factors specifically describing each inbred strain.","We have now studied the effect of C57BL/6 and BALB/c haploid sets of genes on this behaviour by comparing EPM and OF variables of C57BL/6 and BALB/c versus C57BL/6 x BALB/c F1 hybrids (B6CBF1) and chimeric C57BL/6 x BALB/c (CHIM) mice.

"In the present experiment, the effects of neurotoxic lesions (quinolinic acid) of the dorsolateral or dorsomedial striatum were investigated on a simple instrumental discrimination task (CS+/CS-). Rats with lesions of the dorsolateral striatum were found to be impaired in the acquisition of this task, as compared to rats with either dorsomedial striatal or sham lesions. Furthermore, dorsolateral striatal lesioned animals had significantly lower levels of responding across the course of discrimination training, as assessed both by overall rate of response during CS+ presentations and number of CS+ trials without a response, despite having shown levels of responding during variable interval training that did not differ from that of sham lesioned animals. In contrast, animals with lesions of the dorsomedial striatum did not show an impairment in acquisition of the present task, but had slightly higher rates of responding during CS- presentations. It is argued that the poor acquisition and low response rates observed in animals with dorsolateral striatal lesions reflect a failure in stimulus-response learning, while the performance of animals with dorsomedial striatal lesions may have been the result of an increase in overall activity rate.","In the present experiment, the effects of neurotoxic lesions (quinolinic acid) of the dorsolateral or dorsomedial striatum were investigated on a simple instrumental discrimination task (CS+/CS-).","Rats with lesions of the dorsolateral striatum were found to be impaired in the acquisition of this task, as compared to rats with either dorsomedial striatal or sham lesions.

"Apolipoprotein E (apoE), a lipid transporting protein, has been shown to play a vital role in nerve repair and remodeling. Since the olfactory system is in a continuous state of remodeling, the present study tested the hypothesis that apoE is required for normal functioning of the olfactory system. Olfactory behavior of wild-type (WT) and apoE-deficient (apoE KO) mice was assessed by using three standard olfactory tests: (1) the buried food pellet (BFP) test; (2) the odor choice (OC) test; and (3) the odor cued taste avoidance (OCTA) test. ApoE KO mice performed poorly in all the three tests as compared to WT mice, although they learned the tasks at a rate comparable to WT mice. ApoE KO mice had a significantly longer latency to find the buried pellet than WT mice. In the OC experiment, apoE KO mice did not differentiate water from an odorant solution. Furthermore, in the OCTA test the apoE KO mice were significantly less successful than WT mice at avoiding water containing an odorant and a bad tastant. These data demonstrate that apoE deficiency in apoE KO mice leads to a deficit in olfactory function, suggesting an important role for apoE in the olfactory system.","Apolipoprotein E (apoE), a lipid transporting protein, has been shown to play a vital role in nerve repair and remodeling.

"The effects of 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), a neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitor, on spontaneous locomotor activity, morphine-induced hyperactivity, acquisition of place conditioning and morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) were evaluated in male mice. In experiment 1, animals treated with 7-NI (25, 50 and 100mg/kg), morphine (40 mg/kg) or morphine (40 mg/kg) plus 7-NI (25, 50 or 100mg/kg) were placed in an actimeter for 3h. In experiment 2, animals treated with the same drugs and doses were conditioned following an unbiased procedure. 7-NI did not affect the spontaneous locomotor activity or hyperactivity induced by morphine. However, the moderate and high doses of 7-NI produced conditioned place aversion (CPA) and the lowest dose blocked morphine-induced CPP. Our results suggest that nitric oxide is involved in the rewarding properties of morphine but not in its motor effects.","The effects of 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), a neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitor, on spontaneous locomotor activity, morphine-induced hyperactivity, acquisition of place conditioning and morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) were evaluated in male mice.","In experiment 1, animals treated with 7-NI (25, 50 and 100mg/kg), morphine (40 mg/kg) or morphine (40 mg/kg) plus 7-NI (25, 50 or 100mg/kg) were placed in an actimeter for 3h.

"Monkeys with unilateral lesions of nigrostriatal dopamine projections were tested on a series of spatial tasks. One task, in which monkeys were required to use one or the other arm to retrieve food rewards from different positions, allowed separate assessment of the use of each arm in each hemi-space in order to distinguish hemi-spatial and hemi-motor impairments. The lesioned monkeys exhibited a persistent neglect of contralesional space when using either arm which could be dissociated from a motor impairment in the contralesional arm alone. Another task allowed free use of either arm across peri-personal space and demonstrated an ipsilesional bias in the monkeys' self-determined attention (orientation) to a task which they were trying to perform. It is argued that the tendency for monkeys with this lesion to rotate ipsilesionally is due to an ipsilesional deviation of the 'centre of interest' (determined by telencephalic circuitry) relative to 'straight ahead' (determined by brainstem circuitry). The dopamine projections may contribute to cortico-subcortical circuits which determine the spatial layout of mental representation, attention and intention. The results in this primate model of unilateral Parkinson's disease (PD) support the view that patients with left-sided Parkinsonian symptoms exhibit a unilateral deficit in spatial mental representation as well as their well-recognised motor symptoms.

"Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a serine protease immediate-early gene product expressed in brain areas important in learning and memory, has been shown to cleave the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor leading to a potentiated Ca(2+) influx. Mice lacking tPA (tPA-/- mice) have disrupted late phase-LTP in the hippocampus, possibly as a consequence of reduced Ca(2+) flux through NMDA receptors. In the present experiments, we investigated whether the NMDA antagonist dizocilpine might alter performance in tPA-/- mice in behavioural tasks shown to be sensitive to hippocampal lesions. tPA-/- mice and wild-type controls (WT) showed similar rates of acquisition and performance of a spatial working memory task (eight-arm radial maze). Dizocilpine (0.03-0.3 mg/kg, i.p.), given acutely, disrupted performance by increasing the number of errors equally across both genotypes. At asymptotic performance of a differential reinforcement of low response rate operant task (DRL), acute dizocilpine (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) impaired performance, but no differences between genotypes were observed. However, dizocilpine (0.1 mg/kg), given repeatedly during acquisition of a signalled-DRL15"" task, retarded acquisition in tPA-/- but not WT mice. This treatment regime had no effect on locomotor activity in either genotype. tPA-/- mice showed no spatial learning deficits, but were more sensitive to dizocilpine during acquisition (though not expression) of a DRL task. This supports a role for tPA in modification of the NMDA receptor, although absence of tPA does not have consequences for all forms of NMDA-dependent mediated learning.","Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a serine protease immediate-early gene product expressed in brain areas important in learning and memory, has been shown to cleave the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor leading to a potentiated Ca(2+) influx.

"Stress during pregnancy results in neurochemical and behavioral alterations observed throughout adulthood and aging. We here examined the impact of prenatal stress (PS) on cognitive functions in juvenile-4-week-old-rats, focusing on putative sex differences. Dams received an unpredictable 90-min duration contention stress between gestational day E17 and E20. Locomotion and learning ability were examined in offsprings between day P24 and P29 using actimetry, spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze, delayed alternation in the T-maze, and passive avoidance. Both male and female PS rats showed increased activity. In the Y-maze, diminished spontaneous alternation (males: -20%; females: -29%) were seen for PS rats compared to non-PS rats. The number of arm entries was unchanged among groups. In the T-maze, PS rats failed to perform delayed alternation, as shown by equal time spent and number of entries in both the novel and previously explored arms. In the passive avoidance test, PS resulted in significant impairments for female offspring only of both step-through latency and percentage of animals to criterion. PS thus induced severe learning impairments affecting both short-term and long-term memories that could be observed early in lifetime, in 4-week-old, juvenile rats. In addition, marked sex differences were evidenced, particularly in the passive avoidance response that may reflect differential developmental neuroadaptations in precise brain structures.","Stress during pregnancy results in neurochemical and behavioral alterations observed throughout adulthood and aging.

"Depression in humans is associated with sleep abnormalities of three types: altered rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, fragmented sleep, and reduced delta sleep. In an animal model of depression, chronic exposure to mild stressors (CMS, e.g. periods of soiled cage, reversed light/dark cycle, grouped housing, food and/or water deprivation) causes behavioral and hormonal changes which, in humans, often are associated with depression. In the CMS model, a reduced sucrose intake has been defined as one of the core symptoms of depression, anhedonia, although this finding is not consistent among various laboratories. In the present study, we investigated if the CMS procedure, in our laboratory, would cause decreased sucrose intake and, also, give sleep changes similar to what is found in depressed patients. Exposure to CMS decreased sucrose intake in our rats. The largest effect was obtained after 2 weeks of the stress protocol. CMS rats spent more time in REM sleep and showed more fragmented sleep compared to their baseline recording, while there were no changes in the control rats. Increased sleep fragmentation in CMS rats was particularly evident by increased number of arousals, and increased REM sleep and slow-wave-sleep-1 (SWS-1) episodes. The duration of sleep stage episodes was decreased. The amount of slow-wave-sleep-2 (SWS-2) was not decreased, however SWS-2 in percent of total SWS was reduced. Correlation analysis showed that animals that had less consumption of sucrose spent more time in REM sleep and had increased number of REM sleep episodes. In this study, CMS appears to be a model of depression.","Depression in humans is associated with sleep abnormalities of three types: altered rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, fragmented sleep, and reduced delta sleep. In an animal model of depression, chronic exposure to mild stressors (CMS, e.g. periods of soiled cage, reversed light/dark cycle, grouped housing, food and/or water deprivation) causes behavioral and hormonal changes which, in humans, often are associated with depression.

"Unilateral forelimb sensorimotor cortex lesions in adult rats produce a compensatory hyper-reliance on the forelimb ipsilateral to the lesion and temporally related glial and neural plasticity in the contralateral homotopic cortex. Recently, we found that these lesions enhance acquisition of a motor skills task with the ipsilateral, non-impaired, forelimb in comparison to shams. This effect might be related to a denervation-induced facilitation of neuroplastic changes in the motor cortex opposite the lesion and/or to the lesion-induced hyper-reliance on the non-impaired forelimb. The present study assessed whether increased forelimb use, denervation of motor cortical callosal afferents, or a combination of the two influences acquisition of a skilled reaching task. Adult rats with partial corpus callosum transections or sham procedures were either forced to rely on one forelimb or permitted normal forelimb use for 8 days. Rats were then trained for 14 days with their previously non-preferred forelimb (and the forced-use limb) on a unilateral pellet retrieval task. Compared to shams, transections produced a greater acquisition rate and asymptotic performance level on the task. Forced-use improved reaching performance relative to controls, but this effect was less enduring than the improvements produced by transections alone. The addition of forced-use to transections did not further enhance performance. These findings suggest that denervation-induced changes are likely to be a major contributor to the enhanced learning observed after unilateral sensorimotor cortex lesions.","Unilateral forelimb sensorimotor cortex lesions in adult rats produce a compensatory hyper-reliance on the forelimb ipsilateral to the lesion and temporally related glial and neural plasticity in the contralateral homotopic cortex.

"Extreme over-reliance on the impaired forelimb following unilateral lesions of the forelimb representation area of the rat sensorimotor cortex (FL-SMC) leads to exaggeration of injury when overuse is begun during the first week, but not later periods, after injury. Behavioral impairment is partially worsened by the additional tissue loss. In the present study, we show that complete disuse of the impaired forelimb during the first post-operative week renders surviving tissue vulnerable to later overuse of the same limb, in effect extending the window of vulnerability in which use-dependent exaggeration of brain injury can occur. Behavioral recovery is disrupted by complete disuse, but the degree of impairment is variable depending on the nature of the behavioral test employed. Our results uphold the idea that mild rehabilitative training early after injury is beneficial, while either extreme overuse or complete disuse may disrupt functional recovery.","Extreme over-reliance on the impaired forelimb following unilateral lesions of the forelimb representation area of the rat sensorimotor cortex (FL-SMC) leads to exaggeration of injury when overuse is begun during the first week, but not later periods, after injury.

"The present study investigated goal-directed linear locomotion in nine Meni&#xe8;re's patients before and after (1 week, 1 and 3 months) a curative unilateral vestibular neurotomy (UVN). Experiments were done using a 3D motion analysis system in subjects walking eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) towards a real or memorized target, respectively. Locomotor pattern (velocity, step length, step frequency and walk ratio) and walking trajectory deviations were evaluated for normal and fast speeds of locomotion and compared to those recorded in 10 healthy subjects. Before UVN, patients showed no walking deviation but gait pattern changes characterized by slower walks compared to the controls, mainly due to step length and step frequency reductions for both visual conditions and locomotion speeds. In the acute stage after UVN, locomotor pattern impairments were significantly accentuated. On the other hand, patients showed strong walking deviations towards the lesioned side with EC. Opposite lateral deviation towards the intact side were observed with EO for normal speed only. Recovery from impaired locomotor pattern was achieved within 1 month for normal speed but remained uncompensated 3 months post-lesion for fast speed particularly in EC condition. Finally, the walking trajectory deviation towards the lesioned side in the dark was maintained up to 3 months after UVN. The results show that central processing of visual and vestibular cues contributes to an accurate locomotor pointing. They argue for an increased weight of visual reference frame on locomotor functions when vestibular function is unilaterally impaired.","The present study investigated goal-directed linear locomotion in nine Menière's patients before and after (1 week, 1 and 3 months) a curative unilateral vestibular neurotomy (UVN).","Experiments were done using a 3D motion analysis system in subjects walking eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) towards a real or memorized target, respectively.

"The kinematics of treadmill locomotion in rats conceived, born, and raised in a hypergravity environment (HG: 2g) until the age of 3 months was investigated for 5 weeks after their exposition to earth's gravity. The locomotor performance of the HG rats (N=7) was compared to that of age-matched control rats (N=8) housed at 1g for the same period. Kinematic analysis of treadmill locomotion was performed up to 35 days of terrestrial life by an optoelectronic motion analyzer (ELITE system). Results showed that the HG rats exhibited a faster locomotor rhythm (increased number of steps/s), walked closer to the ground, and had a more dorsiflexed foot position. Also, HG rats had shorter steps. The data also highlight a fast adaptation to normal gravity since all the locomotor parameters returned to normal values within 3 weeks. The locomotor modifications may be seen as the persistence of a hypergravity-induced posturo-locomotor adaptation in the centrifuge and/or to more functional changes of sensorimotor systems. Because locomotor performance of HG rats is not severely affected, it is concluded that early development of locomotion processes is highly resistant to gravito-inertial changes.","The kinematics of treadmill locomotion in rats conceived, born, and raised in a hypergravity environment (HG: 2g) until the age of 3 months was investigated for 5 weeks after their exposition to earth's gravity.

"Inbred rat strains for congenital learned helplessness (cLH) and for congenital resistance to learned helplessness (cNLH) were investigated as a model to study genetic predisposition to major depression. Congenitally helpless rats respond less to sucrose under a progressive ratio schedule. This is not confounded by locomotor hypoactivity: in contrast, cLH rats show a slight hyperactivity during the first 5 min of an open field test. cLH rats acquire operant responding to sucrose as readily as cNLH rats and exhibit normal memory acquisition and retrieval in the Morris water maze, thus ruling out general learning deficits as the cause of the decreased response to sucrose. Reduced total responses and reduced breaking points for sucrose in the cLH strain argue for anhedonia, which is an analogue to loss of pleasure essential for the diagnosis of major depressive episodes, and thus confirm the validity of congenitally learned helpless rats as a model of major depression.",Inbred rat strains for congenital learned helplessness (cLH) and for congenital resistance to learned helplessness (cNLH) were investigated as a model to study genetic predisposition to major depression.,"Congenitally helpless rats respond less to sucrose under a progressive ratio schedule.

"Siberian hamsters accumulate fat reserves in long photoperiods, but show a long-term decrease in food intake and body weight when exposed to a short winter photoperiod. The aim of this study was to determine the role of central melanocortin 3/4 receptors (MC3/4-R) in generating this chronic catabolic state by investigating the effects of SHU9119, a MC3/4-R antagonist, on food intake and associated behaviours. In adult male hamsters, intra-cerebroventricular infusions of SHU9119 significantly increased food intake in a dose-dependent manner. The time course of action was slow, food intake being increased between 4 and 24 h after intra-cerebroventricular administration. A similar degree of increase in food intake occurred in fat hamsters in long days and in lean hamsters chronically exposed to short days. Intra-cerebroventricular treatment with MTII (a MC3/4-R agonist) significantly decreased food intake for up to 24 h after treatment, and SHU9119 reversed these suppressive effects between 4 and 24 h after treatment, a similar time course to that observed when SHU9119 was administered alone. We conclude that endogenous melanocortin peptides acting via MC3/4-R are involved in the regulation of food intake in hamsters in both anabolic and catabolic states, but these acute studies do not provide evidence that increased activity of this hypothalamic system underlies the seasonal decrease in food intake that contributes to the long-term catabolic state in short days.","Siberian hamsters accumulate fat reserves in long photoperiods, but show a long-term decrease in food intake and body weight when exposed to a short winter photoperiod.

"Signaled avoidance learning in crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) was investigated when the crayfish were not confined, by indexing two types of locomotive movement to the escape compartment. Mild shocks, which induced tail flipping in the crayfish, and light illumination were used as unconditioned and conditioned stimuli, respectively. In Experiment 1, two groups of crayfish were trained in a one-way shuttle box. The crayfish in Group Forward were placed in the start compartment facing the escape compartment and they were able to escape/avoid shocks by walking forward, while the crayfish in Group Backward were placed in the compartment facing the opposite direction and they were able to escape by tail flipping. Avoidance learning was achieved only by walking, and not by tail flipping despite the fact that consistent tail flipping allowed the crayfish to avoid shocks. In Experiment 2, the experimental conditions were switched by using the ABA design. In this experiment, we confirmed that avoidance behavior was restricted to walking. These results are readily explained by the behavior systems approach.","Signaled avoidance learning in crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) was investigated when the crayfish were not confined, by indexing two types of locomotive movement to the escape compartment.

"Developmental alterations of the cholinergic system can lead to short- and long-term detrimental consequences for brain function. In order to study the cholinergic modulation of behavior in the neonatal mouse, we characterized ultrasonic vocalizations and spontaneous behavior of 5- and 8-day old CD-1 Swiss mice after i.p. administration of the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (doses, 0.8 and 2 mg/kg) during both a first isolation of 30 min and a re-isolation of 5 min, occurring immediately after a brief reunion with the mother. As concerns the first isolation, on PND 5, only scopolamine 0.8m g/kg increased the number of ultrasonic vocalizations and, on PND 8, both doses increased it in a dose-dependent fashion. Scopolamine effects on spontaneous behavior were very limited on PND 5, but markedly evident on PND 8, the high dose increasing activity profile. Independently from treatment, the brief reunion with the mother had no effects on mouse ultrasound emission during re-isolation. The present results show that the cholinergic system plays a role in inhibiting rodent pup USV emission and spontaneous behavior and suggest that the analysis of spontaneous behavior and, in particular, of the number of ultrasonic vocalizations represents a valuable tool to detect precocious developmental alterations of the cholinergic function in the mouse, the most used animal species to model human health disorders.",Developmental alterations of the cholinergic system can lead to short- and long-term detrimental consequences for brain function.,"In order to study the cholinergic modulation of behavior in the neonatal mouse, we characterized ultrasonic vocalizations and spontaneous behavior of 5- and 8-day old CD-1 Swiss mice after i.p. administration of the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (doses, 0.8 and 2 mg/kg) during both a first isolation of 30 min and a re-isolation of 5 min, occurring immediately after a brief reunion with the mother.","As concerns the first isolation, on PND 5, only scopolamine 0.8 mg/kg increased the number of ultrasonic vocalizations and, on PND 8, both doses increased it in a dose-dependent fashion.

"Shuttle activity during repeated presentation of irrelevant auditory (white band noise) and visual (darkness) stimuli was studied in 32 male M&#xf6;ll-Wistar rats. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups. In Group ND the auditory stimulus was used in the first habituation session, and the visual stimulus in the second habituation session. The opposite sequence of stimuli was applied in Group DN. House light was used as a background stimulus in both groups of subjects. The rate of crossing from one compartment to the other was markedly enhanced by noise, regardless of the position of the auditory stimulus in the session's sequence. A clear decrease of response rate was caused by noise termination, whereas neither darkness offset nor onset changed the relatively high and stable rate of responding. The results of this study provided convincing evidence of the energizing influence of the irrelevant auditory cue on the shuttle activity in rats. Moreover, these findings showed that a habituation procedure provides an efficient tool to analyze pure unconditional features of the to-be-conditioned stimuli, and to foresee several response modifications during further conditioning.",Shuttle activity during repeated presentation of irrelevant auditory (white band noise) and visual (darkness) stimuli was studied in 32 male Möll-Wistar rats.

"Amphetamine (AMPH) is known as an anorectic agent. Repeated treatments of AMPH for several days induced a marked anorexia on day 1 followed by a gradual return of food intake to normal level. Previously, using daily food intake (DFI) as an indicator, we found that both dopamine (DA) D1 and D2 receptors were involved in AMPH anorexia. In the present study, using DFI and body weight change (BWC) as indicators, we took a further step to examine whether repeated co-administrations of D1 and D2 agonists might produce an AMPH-like action. Results revealed that repeated co-administrations of D1 and D2 agonists, but not D1 or D2 agonist alone, produced an AMPH-like action (i.e., tolerant DFI and BWC), confirming the previous study. In addition, we examined whether cerebral neuropeptide Y (NPY), an orexigenic neurotransmitter reported to mediate AMPH anorexia, was involved in the anorectic action of D1/D2 co-administration. Our result revealed that injection of NPY antisense into brain could modify the anorectic action of repeated D1/D2 agonists, indicating the involvement of NPY. Taken together, the present results confirmed that both subtypes of D1 and D2 receptors and cerebral NPY were involved in the anorectic action of AMPH.","Amphetamine (AMPH) is known as an anorectic agent.

"Planarians are phylogenetically considered to be the most primitive animals to have acquired a central nervous system and a bilateral symmetry. However, very little is known about the relationship between planarian brain integration and motility. A behavioural and histological study was therefore undertaken in an aspect of planarian motility recovery during its process of regeneration. Quantitative analysis showed that the tail-regenerates recovered their motility gradually as the new heads reformed, while the non-head reforming tail fragments showed no signs of recovery. The head fragments recovered their motility soon after cutting. The cephalic margin was not a function of the motility. The brain regenerated back to its original form in approximately two weeks, the same amount of time it took for the decapitated tails to recover their motility to initial levels. This study provides quantitative evidence that the planarian motility recovered in relation to the head formation during its process of regeneration. Our results reinforce the view that the brain plays a functional part in activating planarian motility.","Planarians are phylogenetically considered to be the most primitive animals to have acquired a central nervous system and a bilateral symmetry.

"In golden hamsters, the expression of a reward-conditioned place preference (CPP) is regulated in a circadian pattern such that the preference is exhibited strongly at the circadian time of prior training but not at other circadian times. We now report that the same ""time-stamp"" phenomenon is expressed following context conditioning with an aversive stimulus (conditioned place avoidance, CPA). Animals that were trained at a specific circadian time to discriminate between a ""safe"" context and one paired with foot shock, showed strong avoidance of the paired context at 24 and 48 h following the last training session, and showed no avoidance at 32 and 40 h following training. Circadian time is a feature that is learned during conditioning even though timing itself is not an explicit discriminative cue in these experiments. The results suggest that in hamsters, the emotional valence associated with the place where arousing stimulation (rewarding and aversive) is encountered is highest at the circadian time of occurrence. The golden hamster may be predisposed to anticipate the recurrence of arousing events at circa-24 h intervals.","In golden hamsters, the expression of a reward-conditioned place preference (CPP) is regulated in a circadian pattern such that the preference is exhibited strongly at the circadian time of prior training but not at other circadian times. Circadian time is a feature that is learned during conditioning even though timing itself is not an explicit discriminative cue in these experiments.","We now report that the same 'time-stamp' phenomenon is expressed following context conditioning with an aversive stimulus (conditioned place avoidance, CPA). Animals that were trained at a specific circadian time to discriminate between a 'safe' context and one paired with foot shock, showed strong avoidance of the paired context at 24 and 48 h following the last training session, and showed no avoidance at 32 and 40 h following training.","The results suggest that in hamsters, the emotional valence associated with the place where arousing stimulation (rewarding and aversive) is encountered is highest at the circadian time of occurrence.

"There is evidence that ageing both in humans and animals is accompanied by changes in emotional behaviour. Behavioural studies in rats point to an increase in emotional reactivity and/or anxiety-related behaviour with age. Here we studied social interaction in young adult (3 months) and aged (30 months old) rats using an established test system for anxiety-related behaviour. Using Fos expression as a marker of neuronal activation, we aimed to investigate whether age-related differences in anxiety would be reflected by changes in neuronal activity in brain regions known to be sensitive to fear- and anxiety-related stimuli. Aged rats spent significantly less time (75%) in active social interaction than young rats, without concomitant changes in general locomotor activity. Social interaction enhanced Fos expression both in young and aged rats in several anxiety-related brain areas. Lower Fos response in aged versus young rats was noted in the dorsomedial, dorsolateral and ventrolateral part of the periaqueductal grey, the medial and basolateral amygdala and parvocellular region of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, while no differences in Fos expression were observed in the other regions examined, including the hippocampus, septum or locus coeruleus. These results demonstrate age-related reduction in social interaction, indicative of enhanced anxiety-related behaviour in aged rats. However, since the supposedly increased anxiety level was not accompanied by augmented Fos expression in any of the key brain areas of the fear/anxiety circuitry known to be activated by anxiogenic stimuli, it is suggested that reduced social interaction does not reflect enhanced anxiety in aged rats.",There is evidence that ageing both in humans and animals is accompanied by changes in emotional behaviour.

"The effects of short-term (15 min) pre-exposure of rats to extremely low-frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF, 50 Hz, 6 mT) on their motor (locomotor and stereotypic) activity induced by d-amphetamine sulphate (AMPH) at different doses (0.5, 1.5 and 4.5mg/kg, i.p.) were studied in the open field test. In saline-treated rats both parameters of motor activity were unaffected by ELF-MF irradiation. The rats pre-exposed to ELF-MF and injected with the lowest dose of AMPH showed the same locomotor activity as control animals, while their stereotypic behaviour was significantly elevated. ELF-MF in combination with AMPH at higher doses significantly enhanced motor activity when compared with values obtained in both control and combined experiments with the lowest dose of the drug. However, only combined locomotor effect at the middle dose of AMPH was significantly greater than those observed in corresponding experiments with AMPH alone. These results demonstrate that acute short-term exposure to ELF-MF is able to modify a motor activity in dependence on the extent of AMPH-induced neurotransmitter imbalance.","The effects of short-term (15 min) pre-exposure of rats to extremely low-frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF, 50 Hz, 6 mT) on their motor (locomotor and stereotypic) activity induced by d-amphetamine sulphate (AMPH) at different doses (0.5, 1.5 and 4.5mg/kg, i.p.) were studied in the open field test.","In saline-treated rats both parameters of motor activity were unaffected by ELF-MF irradiation.

"Maternal tobacco use during pregnancy adversely affects prenatal and postnatal growth and increases the risk of developmental and behavioral deficits in children and adolescents. In the present study, the effects of prenatal nicotine exposure (infused at 6mg/kg/day) and maternal withdraw during neonatal development, was examined in Sprague-Dawley rats on an array of behavioral tasks during different stages of ontogenesis. Offspring of both genders were monitored for exploratory, locomotor, and novelty-seeking activity, anxiety, and learning and memory in an active-avoidance task. Nicotine-exposed animals showed growth retardation, hyperactivity, and poor adaptation in a new environment, increased level of anxiety during the early adolescent period, and robust cognitive deficits in early adulthood. In addition, the deficits were generally more severe in the female nicotine-exposed offspring. Cross-fostering also revealed that while maternal behavior and nicotine withdraw did not affect postnatal somatic growth retardation or cognitive ability of the offspring; measures of exploration and adaptation in a new environment were impacted during the post-weanling and early adolescence period. Nicotine-exposed offspring, and the saline-treated offspring cross-fostered to nicotine-exposed mothers, showed higher measures of anxiety in the elevated plus-maze and decreased novelty-seeking behavior on the hole-board apparatus. These studies demonstrated that prenatal nicotine exposure produced significant long-term developmental and behavioral teratogenic effects. The study design provides a model system for studying the mechanism(s) responsible for the decline in central nervous system function following prenatal nicotine exposure, as well as that of other neurological and behavioral teratogens during pregnancy.",Maternal tobacco use during pregnancy adversely affects prenatal and postnatal growth and increases the risk of developmental and behavioral deficits in children and adolescents.,"In the present study, the effects of prenatal nicotine exposure (infused at 6mg/kg/day) and maternal withdraw during neonatal development, was examined in Sprague-Dawley rats on an array of behavioral tasks during different stages of ontogenesis.

"Different methods of inducing experimental brain lesions can result in distinct neuropathological sequelae. This could be of consequence in attempts to establish animal models of recovery of function following stroke, as differences in the progression of experimental lesion pathology may have an impact on the magnitude and rate of recovery of function observable with any particular lesioning method. In the present study, a novel method of producing a focal ischaemic lesion by intracortical microinjection of endothelin-1 (ET-1) was compared with excitotoxic (microinjection of quinolinic acid) and mechanical (aspiration) lesioning procedures. Lesions were unilateral and were targeted at the forelimb representation zone in sensorimotor cortex. It was found that all three types of lesion had an essentially identical effect with regard to reaching accuracy in a paw-reaching task. All lesioned animals displayed a similar, significant long-term deficit in reaching accuracy and limited degree of recovery relative to sham animals. Off-line analysis of the performance of animals during post-lesion week 9 indicated that animals in each lesion group also displayed a similar deficit. The current results suggest that the spontaneous behavioural consequences of a unilateral lesion of FL in the rat appear to be independent of the nature of lesion production. However, the increased face validity of an ET-1-induced lesion, coupled with the ease of control of lesion placement and extent offered by this technique make for a potentially important animal model for research into drug effects on recovery of function following stroke.","Different methods of inducing experimental brain lesions can result in distinct neuropathological sequelae.

"We know that cats with bilateral lesions of occipital visual cortical areas 17, 18 and 19 sustained during the first postnatal week exhibit a modest level of sparing of the ability to re-orient head and eyes to new stimuli relative to cats that incurred equivalent lesions in adulthood. We now report that cats with equivalent unilateral lesions sustained during the first postnatal week (P1-4), or at the end of the first postnatal month (P27-30), orient to stimuli presented in the contralesional field as proficiently as to stimuli introduced into the ipsilesional field. Moreover, levels of proficiency are indistinguishable from those exhibited by intact cats. Thus, the sparing is greater following unilateral lesions than following bilateral lesions, and the level of sparing approaches completeness. The difference between the bilateral and unilateral lesion results suggests types of pathway reorganizations that may emerge as a result of unilateral occipital lesions. We postulate that the greater sparing is based on modifications in both excitatory and inhibitory circuitry linked to the intact hemisphere, and we provide a framework for future investigations that should be relevant to the comprehension of the repercussions of early unilateral and bilateral lesions sustained by monkeys and humans, which also show more robust residual vision following early relative to later damage of occipital cortex.","We know that cats with bilateral lesions of occipital visual cortical areas 17, 18 and 19 sustained during the first postnatal week exhibit a modest level of sparing of the ability to re-orient head and eyes to new stimuli relative to cats that incurred equivalent lesions in adulthood.","We now report that cats with equivalent unilateral lesions sustained during the first postnatal week (P1-4), or at the end of the first postnatal month (P27-30), orient to stimuli presented in the contralesional field as proficiently as to stimuli introduced into the ipsilesional field.","Moreover, levels of proficiency are indistinguishable from those exhibited by intact cats.

"The pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) as part of the mesencephalic locomotor region is discussed to be involved in motor activity. In this study, we examined whether the PPTg plays a role in exploratory behaviour. Therefore, we compared non-habituated motor behaviour of PPTg lesioned rats with sham lesioned rats under spontaneous, dizocilpine (MK-801) (0.1 and 0.16 mg/kg) and dl-amphetamine (1 and 2 mg/kg) conditions. In order to analyse exploratory behaviour only, session-times were limited to 5 min after placing the rats in an open field. The exploratory motor activity was compared to the motor activity obtained in rats habituated to the environment. PPTg lesions had no effect on spontaneous exploratory behaviour, but it intensified the enhanced motor activity induced by MK-801. However, PPTg lesions blocked the enhanced exploratory behaviour, i.e. horizontal activity, rearing and centre activity induced by amphetamine. These data indicate that the PPTg is involved in behaviour driven by the dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems, when the animals are in a particular motivational state, e.g. a state that increases motor activity for itself, like exploration. This is underlined by the finding that animals exploring their environment show a higher motor activity even after multiple sessions, than animals familiar to the environment.","The pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) as part of the mesencephalic locomotor region is discussed to be involved in motor activity.

"One manner to study the role of serotonin (5-HT) in behavioral functions is through nutritional manipulation of its precursor tryptophan (TRP). By means of the method of acute TRP depletion, plasma TRP levels can be reduced in a reversible way in both humans and rats. In the present study a TRP-free protein-carbohydrate mixture was used to investigate the behavioral effects of lowering TRP and 5-HT concentrations in adult male rats. These animals were tested in models of anxiety (open field, home cage emergence test), depression (forced swimming test) and cognition (object recognition test and Morris water escape test). The TRP-free protein-carbohydrate mixture substantially reduced the ratio TRP/SigmaLNAA within 2 and 4 h by 75 and 60%, respectively. It was found that 4 h after administration, the treatment did not affect anxiety-related behavior nor did it cause depressive-like behavior. Also, no treatment effect was found on spatial learning performance in a Morris water escape test. On the other hand, performance in an object recognition test was clearly impaired after TRP depletion. Taken together, these data suggest that acute lowered central 5-HT levels are not associated with changes in affective behavior (i.e. anxiety and depression), but do impair object memory in adult rats.",One manner to study the role of serotonin (5-HT) in behavioral functions is through nutritional manipulation of its precursor tryptophan (TRP).,"By means of the method of acute TRP depletion, plasma TRP levels can be reduced in a reversible way in both humans and rats.

"The experiment reported was designed to test two hypotheses: that prenatal undernutrition (a) increases emotional reactivity and (b) impairs cognitive flexibility in sheep. The mothers of one group were fed live weight maintenance requirements throughout pregnancy (control, C) while those of another group were fed 50% of that amount from days 1 to 95 of pregnancy and 100% from then onwards (prenatal undernutrition, PU). At 18 months of age, PU sheep were more active during restraint (P &lt; 0.05) and approached a novel stimulus more slowly (P = 0.02). In response to a sudden stimulus, PU males and C females showed a higher initial level of locomotion compared to C males, which only gradually declined, while PU females started at a high initial rate, changing rapidly to immobility. In a T-maze, PU resulted in a shift of side preferences (laterality) from a general right-bias to neutrality in males and to a left-bias in females (P &lt; 0.05). In the two reversal tasks, C males and PU females had a preference for one side over the other, while PU males showed no preference. In contrast to C males, PU males failed to improve their learning speed from the first to the second reversal (P &lt; 0.05).

"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) decreased corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-induced behaviors in neonatal chicks, and serotonin is one of the possible mechanisms through which GLP-1 affects CRF-induced behaviors. The present experiments were conducted to confirm the effect of serotonin on CRF-induced behaviors. In Experiment 1, chicks were intracerebroventricularly injected with either saline, 0.1 microg of CRF, 5.0 microg of serotonin, or 0.1 microg of CRF plus 5.0 microg of serotonin. Injection of CRF caused excitation as evidenced by increased spontaneous activities and distress vocalizations (DVs) compared to the control group. The effect of CRF was attenuated by serotonin since chicks became quiet after given CRF with serotonin. Sleep-like behaviors were observed in the serotonin group. The number of defecations was increased by CRF and decreased by serotonin. Both CRF and serotonin increased plasma corticosterone, and the effect was synergistic. Serotonin dose-dependently decreased locomotor activities of chicks after central administration of 0.1 microg of CRF, 0.1 microg of CRF plus 2.5, 5.0, or 10.0 microg of serotonin in Experiment 2. CRF-induced DVs were modified by serotonin. Instead of DVs, tender and low-pitched vocalizations were observed in chicks treated with CRF plus serotonin, the voice frequencies of which were less than 10 kHz.

"It has been suggested that depletions of accumbens dopamine (DA) make rats more sensitive to work-related response costs. One way of controlling work costs in operant tasks has been to use fixed-ratio (FR) schedules with different ratio requirements. In addition to using ratio requirements to control response costs, investigators also can employ different force requirements. In the present study, different groups of rats were trained on two schedules (FR 1 and FR 5) and weights were placed on the levers 2 days each week. In the FR 5 studies, two different weights were used (32 or 64 g), while three different weights were used in the FR 1 studies (32, 64, or 96 g). After baseline training, rats received intra-accumbens injections of either 6-OHDA to deplete DA, or ascorbate vehicle as the control. The effects of DA depletions were highly schedule-dependent. DA-depleted animals on the FR 5 schedule showed reductions in responding across the different weight conditions. In contrast, DA depletion did not significantly suppress FR 1 responding under any conditions. Addition of weights to the levers reduced responding on the FR 1 and FR 5 schedules, but did not enhance sensitivity to DA depletion. Thus, rats with accumbens DA depletions were sensitive to different ratio requirements, yet they were relatively insensitive to different force requirements within the range tested. These studies indicate that DA depletions make animals sensitive to temporal or rate components of work that greatly influence responding on ratio schedules.","It has been suggested that depletions of accumbens dopamine (DA) make rats more sensitive to work-related response costs.

"Anxiety and depression of unknown etiology are frequent complications of the systemic autoimmune disease lupus erythematosus (SLE). To elucidate key pathogenic factors we study the ""autoimmunity-associated behavioral syndrome"" (AABS) in lupus-prone MRL-lpr mice. Based on the evidence that serum levels of the neuroactive cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) are increased both in human and murine forms of SLE, the present study examines whether sustained IFN-gamma production in non-autoimmune mice induces deficits comparable to AABS, particularly in tasks reflective of emotional reactivity and motivated behavior. For this purpose, wild-type and IFN-gamma knockout C57BL/6J mice were infected with adenovirus carrying the cDNA for murine IFN-gamma (i.p. 2 x 10(8) pfu of virus per mouse) and shortly thereafter tested in the behavioral battery used in the detection of AABS. Serum levels of IFN-gamma were found to peak 24 h after the infection, normalized within 5 days. Although all infected animals showed reduced food/water intake and body weight, the recovery rate was slower in groups injected with IFN-gamma virus. No deficits were observed in the models of anxiety, but blunted responsiveness in the sucrose preference test (a putative model of anhedonia) lasted well beyond the IFN-gamma clearance period. These results suggest that a relatively brief elevation in systemic IFN-gamma levels impairs ingestive behavior and leads to prolonged changes in motivated behavior. As such, they are consistent with the hypothesis that upregulation in synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines contributes to induction of AABS and more specifically, to limbic system dysfunction during lupus-like disease.","Anxiety and depression of unknown etiology are frequent complications of the systemic autoimmune disease lupus erythematosus (SLE).

"We showed previously that neonatal isolation (ISO) enhances acquisition of cocaine self-administration in adult male rats without altering acquisition of food responding. Female rats show poorer performance in learning tasks and are differentially affected by stress compared to male rats. Thus, we investigated whether ISO alters acquisition of operant responding for cocaine and food in female rats with comparison to male rats. Litters were subjected to ISO or were non-handled (NH). Activity levels were assessed in adult rats. Then, rats were implanted with jugular catheters and allowed to self-administer cocaine under a fixed-ratio 1 (FR1) schedule of reinforcement using an escalating dose presentation procedure. Cocaine intake, discrimination of active versus inactive levers, and ineffective active lever responses were tabulated. Effects of non-contingent cocaine infusions (primes) and increasing FR on responding were then assessed. Other rats were allowed to lever press for food under an FR1 schedule (10 s time-out). ISO enhanced acquisition of operant responding for food and cocaine in female rats. The latter was demonstrated by better lever discrimination, emission of fewer ineffective responses, and superior performance in response to primes. Yet, NH females ingested more cocaine than ISO females during the initial acquisition phase. In male rats, ISO enhanced acquisition of cocaine self-administration but not food responding. Activity levels were unaffected by ISO or gender. These data confirm and extend our previous findings demonstrating the enduring effects of ISO on adult self-administration behavior and emphasize the importance of measuring behavioral patterns versus intake in acquisition studies.","We showed previously that neonatal isolation (ISO) enhances acquisition of cocaine self-administration in adult male rats without altering acquisition of food responding.

"Isolated studies showed that norepinephrinergic REM-OFF neurons are active throughout except during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep when they are inhibited possibly by GABA. Similarly, independent studies have also reported that during REM sleep deprivation those REM-OFF neurons continue firing, that there is increased norepinephrine (NE) in the brain and that increased levels of NE increases the Na-K ATPase activity in the brain. However, it was not known if all those changes were directly related to REM sleep deprivation, what could be the mechanism for such changes and their patho-physiological significance. To confirm the same, based on the reports, mostly from our group, it was hypothesised that GABA antagonist in the locus coeruleus (LC) should at least significantly reduce REM sleep and simultaneously increase Na-K ATPase activity in the brain. To confirm the proposed hypothesis, picrotoxin, a GABA-A receptor antagonist, was bilaterally microinjected every 6 h for 36 h into the LC of freely moving normally behaving rats and the effects on electrophysiological signals signifying sleep-wakefulness and on brain synaptosome Na-K ATPase activity were estimated. The microinjection was done with the help of a remote control pump without handling or disturbing the rats. The findings that REM sleep was significantly reduced and there was associated increase in Na-K ATPase activity confirmed our hypothesis. The results also support our modified (GABA-mediated) model of neural connections in the LC for the regulation of REM sleep. Also, this is probably the first report to simulate REM sleep deprivation using receptor antagonist.","Isolated studies showed that norepinephrinergic REM-OFF neurons are active throughout except during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep when they are inhibited possibly by GABA.

"Zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) larvae (8 days) were tested singly in a swimway made up of six compartments. The larva emerged into each compartment in turn, and its response to visual features (e.g. turning away) was affected by memory of previous layouts, as well as by home tank experience. The use of stimuli placed far to the right or left proved to engage preferentially the eye system directly fed by right or left eye system (RES, LES). At least three behavioural mechanisms appeared to show similar laterality in larva and adult. Both turned right in startle-induced locomotion. In both, LES was preferentially involved in assessment of novelty. Thus, in larvae, use of LES caused more investigation of a familiar stimulus in a strange context. Finally, in larvae there was some evidence that (as is the case in adults) RES was responsible for the visual control of response. Here the evidence for the adult was the preferential use of the right eye to view the object of response, whereas for the larva, it was the enhanced ability to sustain a motor strategy when RES was in use.","Zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) larvae (8 days) were tested singly in a swimway made up of six compartments.

"Humans are able to learn complex sequences even without conscious awareness. We have studied the repercussions of circadian phase and sleep pressure on the ability to learn structured sequences using a serial reaction time task (SRT). Sixteen young healthy volunteers were studied in a 40-h ""constant posture protocol"" under high sleep pressure (i.e. sleep deprivation) and low sleep pressure conditions (i.e. sleep satiation attained by multiple naps). Here we show that learning of different sequence structures improved after multiple naps, in particular after naps that followed the circadian peak of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. This situation following sleep contrasted with the lack of learning without sleep. We have evidenced that the observed amelioration of learning new sequences came about by memorizing short sub-fragments (""chunks"") of the sequence train. However, SRT performance did not deteriorate under high sleep pressure, despite the high level of sleepiness. Our data indicate that sequence learning is modulated by circadian phase, and the neurophysiological medium required for this type of learning is related to sleep.",Humans are able to learn complex sequences even without conscious awareness.

"Rotenone (an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I) has been proposed as a model of Parkinson's disease (PD) as it induces nigrostriatal degeneration associated with alpha-synuclein inclusions. So far, only peripherally administered rotenone has been used as a model of PD. There has not been any investigation on the neurobehavioral changes induced by bilateral lesions of dopaminergic neurons by rotenone in rats. In the present study, rotenone (3 microg) was administered bilaterally stereotaxically into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) to produce parkinsonian symptoms. Behavioural and biochemical data showed a strong increase in catalepsy, a decrease in locomotor activity and a significant depletion of dopamine levels in the striatum as compared to sham-lesioned animals. If the locomotor deficits are caused by the depletion of dopaminergic neurons, then L-DOPA should counteract motor deficits because L-DOPA therapy reverses mostly all motor deficits in human Parkinsonian patients. To examine the effectiveness of L-DOPA in reversing the motor deficit in rats, two different doses of L-DOPA (5 and 10 mg/kg) in combination with the peripheral amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor benserazide were daily administrated intraperitonially for a period of 31 days lesioned animals. L-DOPA plus benserazide counteracted catalepsy dose-dependently and increased locomotor activity. The results indicate that rotenone infused into the MFB destroys dopaminergic neurons, induces pakinsonian symptoms that are reversed by the clinically effective anti-parkinsonian drug L-DOPA. Therefore, sterotaxically infused rotenone may be useful for screening drugs for the treatment of PD.","Rotenone (an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I) has been proposed as a model of Parkinson's disease (PD) as it induces nigrostriatal degeneration associated with alpha-synuclein inclusions.

"In Parkinson's disease, besides the dopaminergic neurodegeneration, locus coeruleus noradrenergic neurons degenerate as well. Noradrenergic neurons have potential anti-parkinsonian, neuromodulatory and neuroprotective properties. Presently, an animal model with dopaminergic lesion has been used as a standard model of Parkinson's disease. The behavioral effects of dopaminergic agents in a Parkinson's animal model with additional noradrenergic lesions has not been studied so far. Here, the behavioral effects of dopaminergic agents L-DOPA (15 mg/kg) and D-amphetamine (4 mg/kg) in two different pathophysiological conditions have been explored; One group involving only dopaminergic deficiency with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and the other group with both dopaminergic and noradrenergic deficiency with N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4). DSP-4 specifically depleted noradrenaline from locus coeruleus terminal fields. 6-OHDA lesion depleted dopamine and its metabolites DOPAC, HVA and 3-MT in the regions of basal ganglia and it was potentiated by additional locus coeruleus denervation. Dopaminergic lesion produced catalepsy and hypoactivity. Hypoactivity in openfield was potentiated by additional noradrenergic denervation of locus coeruleus neurons. L-DOPA produced effective anticataleptic activity in group with both dopaminergic and noradrenergic lesions and D-amphetamine was found to be more effective in group only with dopaminergic lesions, indicating increased dopaminergic neurodegeneration after noradrenergic lesions.

"The present study was designed to assess effects of aversive stimuli on learning and memory in wild-caught Arctic ground squirrels (AGS, Spermophilus parryii) using an active avoidance learning paradigm. Results indicate that animals trained with low-value aversive stimuli (air puffs and lights) retained the task better than animals trained with high-value aversive stimuli (air puffs, lights, and foot shock). Poor retention could not be explained by learning impairment, fear-induced freezing behavior or the effects of massed versus spaced training trials. Wild-caught AGS readily hibernate under laboratory conditions and provide a model of pronounced adult synaptic plasticity associated with emergence from hibernation. Characterization of learning and retention using active avoidance as well as other learning paradigms is a first step towards developing behavioral paradigms to assess cognitive function in this wild-trapped species. The present study shows that captive AGS are sensitive to aversive stimuli, argues for a direct effect on retention and suggests that high baseline levels of stress in a captive population may influence behavioral measures. The results further suggest that future studies of the effects of hibernation on learning and retention of active avoidance tasks employ low-level aversive stimuli.","The present study was designed to assess effects of aversive stimuli on learning and memory in wild-caught Arctic ground squirrels (AGS, Spermophilus parryii) using an active avoidance learning paradigm.

"We previously reported that rats exposed to neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) insult showed selective and long-lasting learning and memory impairments in the plus maze, 8-arm radial maze, choice reaction time (CRT) task, and water maze, and that they showed severe brain injury to areas such as parietal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and thalamus. In this study, we examined the effects of hypothermia and hyperthermia on learning and memory deficits following neonatal HI insult. Seven-day-old Wistar rats were subjected to left carotid artery ligation followed by 2 h of hypoxia (8% O2/92% N2) under three different temperature conditions: 27 degrees C (hypothermia), 33 degrees C (normothermia) and 37 degrees C (hyperthermia) in temperature-controlled chambers. Hypothermia significantly reduced attentional deficits in the CRT task and spatial learning deficits in the water maze, and protected against severe brain injury in comparison with the control temperature. On the other hand, hyperthermia aggravated the behavioral deficits and brain injury. These outcomes clearly show that temperature regulation during HI insult plays an important role in the induction of behavioral and histological changes following neonatal HI insult in rats.","We previously reported that rats exposed to neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) insult showed selective and long-lasting learning and memory impairments in the plus maze, 8-arm radial maze, choice reaction time (CRT) task, and water maze, and that they showed severe brain injury to areas such as parietal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and thalamus.","In this study, we examined the effects of hypothermia and hyperthermia on learning and memory deficits following neonatal HI insult.

"Male rats outperform females in spatial tasks, such as the water maze (WM). Female rats are known to have higher basal serum corticosterone (CORT) levels and to manifest a more rapid and stronger CORT response to novel stressors. Sex differences in stress responses to the handling and forced swimming in the WM task might contribute to the sex difference in WM performance. In Experiment 1, naive females were found to be impaired relative to naive males in swimming to a visible platform in a WM pool due to strongly thigmotaxic swimming by females. In Experiment 2, serum CORT, a physiological measure of stress, was highly elevated during and after WM training, with female &gt; male values and strong inverse correlations between CORT and measures of WM performance in females. Familiarization with the WM pool and test procedures by strategies pretraining prior to spatial training reduced or eliminated the sex differences in the stress response and WM performance. In Experiment 3, adrenalectomy to eliminate the stress response eliminated sex differences in WM performance. Taken together, the results suggest that male and female rats may harbor brain circuitry that is equally capable of accurate spatial navigation and memory in the WM but which may be impaired to different degrees by the differential stress responses triggered by WM testing.","Male rats outperform females in spatial tasks, such as the water maze (WM).

"There is considerable interest in elucidating neurocognitive mechanisms of cocaine addiction. This report focuses on the hippocampal memory system. Using food reward, two cognitive tasks were examined after lidocaine inactivation of the dorsal (dSUB) or ventral (vSUB) subiculum, the primary hippocampal output regions in rats. These tasks were conducted to first identify functionally relevant stereotaxic coordinates within the hippocampal memory system, in order to then examine its role in regulating drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior studied under a contextually discriminable FI 5-min(FR5:S) second-order schedule of cocaine and brief stimulus delivery. Inactivation of the dSUB and vSUB with 10microg lidocaine impaired hippocampal-dependent win-shift performance. Amygdalar-dependant conditioned cue preference, used as a test for behavioral specificity of lidocaine, was not affected following inactivation of either site. Inactivation of the dSUB with 100 microg lidocaine significantly reduced drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior studied during the cocaine self-administration maintenance phase. Following extinction, inactivation of neither the dSUB nor vSUB influenced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior induced by drug-paired cues presented alone or with a cocaine priming injection. The impairments in win-shift performance are consistent with the spatial processing functions of the dSUB and vSUB, and the reduction in drug-taking behavior is consistent with the non-spatial temporal processing functions of the dSUB. The lack of an effect of dSUB and vSUB inactivation on reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior may relate to the fact that the contextual associations with cocaine were well-practiced at the time of cue reinstatement testing, and therefore, drug-seeking behavior was likely regulated by nonhippocampal-dependent mechanisms.",There is considerable interest in elucidating neurocognitive mechanisms of cocaine addiction.

"The dopamine agonist apomorphine (apo) elicits bouts of stereotyped pecking in pigeons, a response which increases with successive apo injections. This sensitization is strongly context-specific and has been suggested to arise through a Pavlovian conditioning to both external and internal cues. We hypothetized that this learning involves dopamino-glutamatergic interactions and investigated the issue by inducing NMDA glutamate receptor blockades with the antagonist dizocilpine (diz). A first experiment examined the effects that four different doses (ranging between 0.05 and 0.12 mg/kg) of diz co-administered with a standard dose of 0.5 mg/kg of apo had on the development of the incremented response and on the later expression of the conditioned pecking response. Both responses were impaired by doses of around 0.10 mg/kg diz. A second experiment assessed whether either a diz treatment or a diz plus apo co-treatment affected the development of a subsequent sensitization to apo. The first treatment had no effect on the latter sensitization. A part sensitization that arose with the second treatment did not transfer to the final sensitization. The last experiment examined whether the administration of diz had an immediate effect on the incremented responding to apo and on the conditioned response shown by already sensitized pigeons. No effect was apparent with the first treatment, but there was a marked response inhibition with the second treatment. It is concluded that NMDA glutamate receptors play an important role in apo-induced sensitization in pigeons which is compatible with the Pavlovian conditioning account of sensitization.","The dopamine agonist apomorphine (apo) elicits bouts of stereotyped pecking in pigeons, a response which increases with successive apo injections.

"Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of lithium chloride (LiCl) has two effects on pain sensation: (1) it induces a transient hyperalgesia that is reversed by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) or intrathecal (i.t.) administration of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone or by peripheral administration of the quaternary compound naloxone methiodide [Behav. Neurosci. 114 (2000) 1183]; (2) it produces a long-lasting (24 h) reduction in morphine analgesia and does so in the absence of hyperalgesia [Behav. Brain Res. 142 (2003) 89]. We confirmed that rats administered with LiCl showed a reduction in analgesia when administered morphine 24 h later.

However, i.p. administration of naloxone methiodide prior to testing 24 h after an injection with LiCl did not restore morphine analgesia.

"The effects of flesinoxan, a selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist, and of WAY 100635, a selective high affinity 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, on spontaneous sleep were studied in adult rats implanted for chronic sleep recordings. Systemic administration of flesinoxan (0.03 and/or 0.06 micromol/kg, s.c.) increased waking (W) and sleep latencies and reduced REM sleep (REMS) and the number of REM periods during the first and/or second 2-h period after treatment. Systemic injection of WAY 100635 (0.46 and/or 0.92 micromol/kg, s.c.) augmented W and REMS latency and reduced REMS and the number of REM periods during the 6-h recording period. Microinjection of flesinoxan (0.03, 0.06 and/or 0.12 nmol) into the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) reduced REMS and the number of REM periods, and augmented REMS latency during the first, second, and/or third 2-h recording period. Direct infusion of WAY 100635 (0.06 and/or 0.12 nmol) into the LDT increased REMS and the number of REM periods during the first and/or second 2 h of recording. It is proposed that the activation by flesinoxan of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors located in the LDT could be responsible for the REMS suppression. The increase in REMS after the blockade of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the LDT by WAY 100635 further supports our proposal. The effects of systemic flesinoxan on sleep variables may depend mainly on the activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, whereas the effects corresponding to systemic WAY 100635 may be predominantly related to the blockade of presynaptic somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors.","The effects of flesinoxan, a selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist, and of WAY 100635, a selective high affinity 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, on spontaneous sleep were studied in adult rats implanted for chronic sleep recordings.","Systemic administration of flesinoxan (0.03 and/or 0.06 micromol/kg, s.c.) increased waking (W) and sleep latencies and reduced REM sleep (REMS) and the number of REM periods during the first and/or second 2-h period after treatment.

"A visual acuity task performed in the water maze in rats [Behav. Brain Res. 119 (2001) 77] was used to reveal the sensitivity of the visual system to muscarinic receptor blockade. Intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 mg/kg scopolamine had no effect, but 2 mg/kg severely compromised visual acuity, but did not affect the swim strategy to solve the task. Spatial learning in a reference memory version of the water maze, however, was impaired by 0.2 mg/kg scopolamine. It was also confirmed that the same visual acuity task is applicable to C57BL6/J mice. The visual deficit induced by 2 mg/kg scopolamine was less severe compared to rats, possibly due to a change in swim strategy in the drug condition.

"This study was performed to investigate whether or not the histamine H3-antagonist clobenpropit can ameliorate spatial memory deficits induced by MK-801 (0.3 microg per site) as evaluated by an eight-arm radial maze task of rats. A bilateral intrahippocampal (i.h.) injection of clobenpropit (5, 10 microg per site, dose-dependent) markedly improved the working and reference memory deficits induced by MK-801. Its ameliorating effect was potentiated by histidine, but completely antagonized by immepip (2.5 microg per site), a selective H3-agonist. alpha-Fluoromethylhistidine (FMH, 25 microg per site), a selective histidine decarboxylase inhibitor prevented the ameliorating effect of clobenpropit on the working memory deficits induced by MK-801. In addition, the H(1-antagonist pyrilamine, but not the H2-antagonist cimetidine, also inhibited the procognitive effects of clobenpropit. Both FMH and pyrilamine did not significantly modulate the effect of clobenpropit on reference memory. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that the procognitive effects of clobenpropit in MK-801-induced working memory deficits is mediated by increasing endogenous histamine release.

"Pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response is a measure of sensorimotor gating which has been frequently shown to be deficient in schizophrenic patients. In humans it is typically measured as the attenuation of the startle eye-blink reflex EMG when a startle eliciting noise is preceded by a weak white noise pre-pulse (PP), the interval between the PP and the startle noise stimulus (SNS) determining the degree of inhibition. Aiming at developing a new animal model of schizophrenia, we have investigated the acoustic startle eye-blink and PPI in 10 G&#xf6;ttingen minipigs. The stimuli and the block design of the stimulation were similar to paradigms used in human research. Initially the startle habituation across trials and blocks, secondarily the PPI at PP to SNS intervals of 30, 60, 120, 220, 520, 1020 and 2020 ms was investigated. One pig out of ten did not have a startle response, and three other pigs did not have a startle response of a sufficient magnitude to demonstrate the PPI seen in the other six pigs at the expected PP intervals of 60, 120, and 220 ms. Maximal inhibition was seen at the 220 ms interval (mean PPI 58.6%, range -18.4 to 94.6%, N = 9). Most of the results in the pigs are in accordance with findings in studies of the human startle eye-blink EMG and this initial study promotes further studies and the use of the PPI measure in the validation of minipig models of psychiatric disorders.","Pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response is a measure of sensorimotor gating which has been frequently shown to be deficient in schizophrenic patients.

"A dextromethorphan (3-methoxy-17-methylmorphinan) analog, dimemorfan (3-methyl-N-methylmorphinan) that is not metabolized to dextrorphan [3-hydroxy-17-methylmorphinan, which induces phencyclidine (PCP)-like behavioral effects], attenuates maximal electroshock seizures. However, the pharmacological mechanism of action of dimemorfan remains to be determined. In this study, we assessed the locomotor activity mediated by these morphinans. Circling behavior was pronounced in mice treated with PCP or dextrorphan, while animals treated with dextromethorphan exhibited moderate behaviors. Dimemorfan did not show any significant behavioral effects. We used BAY k-8644 (an L-type Ca2+ channel agonist in the dihydropyridine class) to explore the effects of dextromethorphan and dimemorfan on the convulsant activity regulated by calcium channels. Intracerebroventricular injection of BAY k-8644 (37.5 microg) significantly induced seizures in mice. As with dextromethorphan (6.25 or 12.5 mg/kg), dimemorfan (6.25 or 12.5 mg/kg) pretreatment significantly attenuated BAY k-8644-induced seizures in a dose-dependent manner.

Pretreatment with dextromethorphan or dimemorfan significantly attenuated the expression induced by BAY k-8644. Therefore, our results suggest that the anticonvulsant effects of dextromethorphan and dimemorfan are mediated, at least in part, via L-type calcium channel, and that dimemorfan is equipotent to dextromethorphan in preventing BAY k-8644-induced seizures, while it lacks behavioral side effects related to psychotomimetic reactions.","A dextromethorphan (3-methoxy-17-methylmorphinan) analog, dimemorfan (3-methyl-N-methylmorphinan) that is not metabolized to dextrorphan [3-hydroxy-17-methylmorphinan, which induces phencyclidine (PCP)-like behavioral effects], attenuates maximal electroshock seizures.

"Research has focused mainly on the acquisition phase of spatial tasks, while retention has been relatively ignored. In three experiments, we determine the type of information that is retained in spatial memory using the water maze task. In experiment 1, we demonstrate that by rotating the distal cues 180 degrees post-acquisition Wistar rats search in the opposite area to where the platform should be. This search continues for a maximum of 30 s. We then demonstrate (experiment 2) that by rotating the starting position (180 degrees post-acquisition) animals remain at the starting-point for 10 s. They then commence searching in the platform area. In experiment 3, we demonstrate that rotations of distal cues and starting position post-acquisition impair retention of the platform's location. We suggest that the association between the configuration of distal cues and platform location is retained in memory but the association is fragile and sensitive to disruption.","Research has focused mainly on the acquisition phase of spatial tasks, while retention has been relatively ignored.","In three experiments, we determine the type of information that is retained in spatial memory using the water maze task.

"Animals turn away from the hemisphere with the more active dopamine (DA) system. For humans, a similar relationship has been assumed. However, results from independent studies were obtained from different tasks and indicated different side preferences. To investigate side preferences between different tasks within the same subject, we assessed in 36 healthy research participants (20 women) (1) long-term spontaneous turning (number of 360 degree turns during 20 h), (2) veering (lateral deviations during walking blindfolded straight forward) and (3) stepping (deviations while stepping blindfolded on a given spot) behavior. We observed a left-sided preference for long-term spontaneous turning behavior and no significant side preference for veering and stepping behavior. The absence of consistent side preferences suggests that DA does not equally control lateralized whole-body movements. We propose that visual control enhanced left-sided movement preferences, probably through an enhanced contribution of the right hemisphere to visuo-spatial behavior. Recently, we reported [Neurosci. Lett. 339 (2003) 115] that levodopa supplementation decreases right-sided veering tendencies, while stepping behavior was unaffected by substance intake. We suggest that veering tendencies, which appeared equally pronounced in either direction, are under dopaminergic control as long as attention is directed towards extrapersonal space. Side preferences in lateralized whole-body movement tasks are thus neither comparable between tasks nor within subjects. We conclude that experimental parameters such as visuo-spatial control and spatial task demands (veering is directed to extrapersonal space and stepping to peripersonal space) determine whether or not the DA system is involved.","Animals turn away from the hemisphere with the more active dopamine (DA) system.

Rats were given unilateral injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the substantia nigra. PACAP-treated animals received 0.1 microg PACAP as a pretreatment. Control animals without PACAP treatment displayed severe hypokinesia at 1 and 10 days postlesion when compared to animals receiving saline only. In only 1 day postlesion, by contrast, PACAP-treated rats showed no hypokinesia. Asymmetrical signs, such as turning, rearing and biased thigmotaxic scanning were observed in all lesioned animals 1 day postlesion. PACAP-treated animals, however, showed better recovery as they ceased to display asymmetrical signs 10 days later and showed markedly less apomorphine-induced rotations. Tyrosine-hydroxylase immunohistochemistry revealed that control animals had more than 95% loss of the dopaminergic cells in the ipsilateral substantia nigra, while PACAP-treated animals had only approximately 50% loss of dopaminergic cells. In summary, the present results show the neuroprotective effect of PACAP in 6-OHDA-induced lesion of substantia nigra, with less severe acute neurological symptoms and a more rapid amelioration of behavioral deficits.","Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a pleiotropic neuropeptide, exerting different actions in the central and peripheral nervous systems.

"In order to find out whether the inferior colliculus, in addition to its auditory decoding function, also has an auditory gating function in the sense that it treats self-produced sounds differently from external ones, we have explored the inferior colliculus and bordering tegmentum for neurones reacting differently to self-produced vocalizations and vocalizations produced by conspecifics. The experiments were made in the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), using a telemetric extracellular recording technique which allowed to register neuronal activity in freely moving animals during natural vocal communication. The results show that the neurones of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus do not react differently to self-produced and group mate vocalizations of the same type. In the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus, in addition to classical auditory neurones, neurones are found which react to the vocalizations of group mates, but not to self-produced vocalizations. In the paralemniscal area just below the inferior colliculus, there are neurones which are active during self-produced vocalization, but not during vocalization produced by other animals. The results suggest that the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus and bordering tegmentum are involved in vocalization-dependent auditory gating processes.","In order to find out whether the inferior colliculus, in addition to its auditory decoding function, also has an auditory gating function in the sense that it treats self-produced sounds differently from external ones, we have explored the inferior colliculus and bordering tegmentum for neurones reacting differently to self-produced vocalizations and vocalizations produced by conspecifics.","The experiments were made in the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), using a telemetric extracellular recording technique which allowed to register neuronal activity in freely moving animals during natural vocal communication.","The results show that the neurones of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus do not react differently to self-produced and group mate vocalizations of the same type.

"We asked whether the effects of exposure to two human sex-steroid derived compounds were context dependent. The effects of sniffing 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and 1,3,5(10),16-estratetraen-3-ol (EST) on mood, memory, and autonomic nervous system responses were explored in 72 participants. Subjects were tested with AND, EST, or a Control compound within four mood contexts: neutral, sexually aroused, sad and happy. These moods were successfully induced using selected film segments (P &lt; 0.0001). During the neutral context, none of the compounds affected mood or autonomic nervous system function. However, compound effects were significantly increased within arousing contexts. During the sexually arousing context, both compounds increased sexual arousal (P &lt; 0.029). During the sad context, AND maintained positive mood in women (P&lt; 0.050) and increased negative mood in men (P &lt; 0.031). Memory for events during the sad context was impaired by AND in women (P &lt; 0.047) but not in men. Finally, effects of AND on physiology were observed during the sexually arousing context whereby AND increased skin temperature in both sexes (P &lt; 0.022) but reduced abdominal respiration rate in men only (P &lt; 0.034).

"Developments in the genetic manipulation of mice have intensified interest in the relation between genes, environment and learned behavior, which in turn has led to exploration of experimental procedures for assessing genetic influences on learning using methods such as response acquisition. The requirement for multiple experimental control groups in such genetic comparisons studies amplifies the need for reliable, instrument-directed, learning assessment paradigms. The purpose of the present experiment was to implement such a procedure in several successive phases, including pre-food basal rates of interaction with sensors in a chamber, food-hopper training, and a simple disk-baiting procedure that produced differentially food-reinforced disk pressing (FR1) and provided quantitative measures of learning in outbred (CD-1) and inbred (C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ) mice. Response acquisition performances were measured in terms of the number of correct food-producing responses (disk press to hopper entry in less than 5s). The three mouse types showed differences in several performance measures prior to response acquisition training. Pre-food basal performances did not predict subsequent rate of acquisition of the target response. On average, CD-1 mice met a criterion of 50 food-producing responses slightly, but not significantly, faster than BALB/cJ mice. The C57BL/6J mice took significantly longer to meet the learning criterion and had slower response rates, due to longer after-reinforcement pausing. Procedural differences (massed versus partial/distributed training) and reinforcement parameters (duration of access) may differentially affect different mouse types independently of genetic differences in response acquisition.","Developments in the genetic manipulation of mice have intensified interest in the relation between genes, environment and learned behavior, which in turn has led to exploration of experimental procedures for assessing genetic influences on learning using methods such as response acquisition.

"Adult Long-Evans male rats were subjected to electrolytic lesions of the ventral subiculum, and tested for locomotor activity in the home cage, reference and working memory in the water maze, working memory in the radial maze, and D-amphetamine-induced locomotion (1mg/kg, i.p.). When compared to their sham-operated counterparts, lesioned rats showed nocturnal hyperactivity, no reference memory deficit, but working memory was impaired in the water maze and during the initial stage of radial-maze testing. Their locomotor responsiveness to D-amphetamine was exaggerated. Histological verifications confirmed lesions in the ventral subiculum. Material stained for acetylcholinesterase activity indicated septohippocampal and commissural/associational sprouting, accounting for partial damage to the perforant paths. These results showed that ventral subiculum lesions (i) do not alter the capability of rats to learn repeatedly presented spatial information, and (ii) impair, but do not prevent, spatial working memory, suggesting that the ventral subiculum is preferentially involved in short-term memory for spatial locations. Given the electrolytic nature of the lesion, the lesion-induced potentiation of the locomotor response to amphetamine is probably easier explained by partial disruption of the perforant paths than by damage to neurons of the ventral subiculum.","Adult Long-Evans male rats were subjected to electrolytic lesions of the ventral subiculum, and tested for locomotor activity in the home cage, reference and working memory in the water maze, working memory in the radial maze, and D-amphetamine-induced locomotion (1mg/kg, i.p.).","When compared to their sham-operated counterparts, lesioned rats showed nocturnal hyperactivity, no reference memory deficit, but working memory was impaired in the water maze and during the initial stage of radial-maze testing.

"The recognition that certain aspects of prefrontal function can be effectively modeled in rats has led to a slow expansion of interest in rat prefrontal cortex over the past decade. One of the most promising of these model systems is the orbitofrontal cortex of the rat. Rat orbitofrontal cortex is anatomically similar to the orbital prefrontal region in primates, and this similarity is borne out by behavioral and neurophysiological findings. Here we will present data on orbitofrontal cortex function from a number of parallel studies from our laboratories that employed single unit recording techniques to probe neural encoding in rat orbitofrontal cortex and related parts of the amygdala and the hippocampal memory systems. Together, these reports and associated behavioral studies suggest that the orbitofrontal region, in both rats and primates, is specialized to integrate concrete and abstract sensory constructs with information regarding the incentive value of associated outcomes to guide or modulate behavior. To the extent that monkey prefrontal function can model certain aspects of human prefrontal function, we argue that this model can now be extended to the rat orbitofrontal cortex. In addition, we argue that the function of orbitofrontal cortex needs to be considered in terms of its interactions with other brain systems.","The recognition that certain aspects of prefrontal function can be effectively modeled in rats has led to a slow expansion of interest in rat prefrontal cortex over the past decade.

"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to be involved in associative learning; however, its specific role in acquisition of cued classical conditioning has not yet been determined. Furthermore, the role of regional differences within the PFC in the acquisition of cued conditioning is not well described. These issues were addressed by exposing rats to either one or four sessions of a cued classical conditioning task, and subsequently examining c-fos immunoreactivity in various areas of the PFC. Differences in patterns of c-fos immunopositive nuclei were found when comparing the PFC areas examined. No significant differences were found between rats presented with a temporally contingent conditioned stimulus (CS) light and food (paired groups) and those presented with the same stimuli temporally non-contingently (unpaired groups). In lateral and orbital PFC, both the paired and unpaired groups showed more c-fos immunopositive nuclei than control groups exposed only to the behavioral setup (context exposed groups), and all groups showed a drop in c-fos immunopositive nuclei from session 1 to session 4. In dorsal medial PFC, no differences were seen between the paired, unpaired and context exposed groups. These groups did, however, differ from naive animals, an effect that was not seen in the ventral medial PFC. The results of this study do not support a role for the PFC in the acquisition of a cued classical conditioning task. The differences seen between paired, unpaired and context exposed groups in orbital and lateral PFC could be due to contextual conditioning or reward-related effects.","The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to be involved in associative learning; however, its specific role in acquisition of cued classical conditioning has not yet been determined.

"The present review surveys a broad range of findings on the functions of the rodent prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the context of the known pathophysiology of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). An overview of clinical findings concludes that dysfunction of the right PFC plays a critical role in ADHD and that a number of early developmental factors conspire to increase the risk of the disorder. Rodent studies are described which go far in explaining how the core processes which are deficient in ADHD are mediated by the PFC and that the mesocortical dopamine (DA) system plays a central role in modulating these functions. These studies also demonstrate a surprising degree of cerebral lateralization of prefrontal function in the rat. Importantly, the PFC is highly vulnerable to a wide variety of early developmental insults, which parallel the known risk factors for ADHD. It is suggested that the regulation of physiological and behavioral arousal is a fundamental role of the PFC, upon which many ""higher"" prefrontal functions are dependent or at least influenced. These right hemispheric arousal systems, of which the mesocortical DA system is a component, are greatly affected by early adverse events, both peri- and postnatally. Abnormal development, particularly of the right PFC and its DAergic afferents, is suggested to contribute directly to the core deficits of ADHD through dysregulation of the right frontostriatal system.","The present review surveys a broad range of findings on the functions of the rodent prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the context of the known pathophysiology of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

"A crucial aspect of organizing goal-directed behavior is the ability to form neural representations of relationships between environmental stimuli, actions and reinforcement. Very little is known yet about the neural encoding of response-reward relationships, a process which is deemed essential for purposeful behavior. To investigate this, tetrode recordings were made in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) of rats performing a Go-NoGo task. After task acquisition, a subset of neurons showed a sustained change in firing during the rewarded action sequence that was triggered by a specific visual cue. When these changes were monitored in the course of learning, they were seen to develop in parallel with the behavioral learning curve and were highly sensitive to a switch in reward contingencies. These sustained changes correlated with the reward-associated action sequence, not with sensory or reward-predicting properties of the cue or individual motor acts per se. This novel type of neural plasticity may contribute to the formation of response-reinforcer associations and of behavioral strategies for guiding goal-directed action.","A crucial aspect of organizing goal-directed behavior is the ability to form neural representations of relationships between environmental stimuli, actions and reinforcement.

"Accumulative evidence indicates that acute (before extinction) and long-lasting (during extinction) depression can occur at excitatory synapses in mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during re-exposure to a tone (conditioned stimulus: CS), previously paired with footshock (unconditioned stimulus: US). As recently shown, the long-term depression (LTD)-like plasticity in the mPFC does not interfere with extinction of CS-evoked freezing but predicts spontaneous recovery of this fear response. Here, the objectives were to investigate: (i). whether a resistance to extinction without any prefrontal acute synaptic plasticity could produce LTD-like changes, and (ii). by the use of paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) analyses, whether pre- or post-synaptic mechanisms were involved in this LTD phenomenon. Preliminary analyses indicated that levels of acute depression did not correlate with the degree of fear acquisition (effects of number of CS-US pairings). As a consequence, mice conditioned with 2CS+ or 2CS+/2CS- (partial reinforcement of the CS known to induce resistance to extinction) exhibited CS-associated freezing without any acute synaptic depression in the mPFC. However, during further CS-alone presentations, the 2CS+/2CS- group developed LTD-like changes that accompanied their resistance to extinguish freezing to the CS. In contrast, the 2CS+ group normally extinguished their conditioned freezing with synaptic transmission remaining at baseline levels. PPF analyses revealed that facilitation was unchanged following prefrontal LTD. These data, combined with our previous findings, (i). support a critical involvement of prefrontal LTD-like changes in spontaneous recovery of fear responses, and (ii). suggest a post-synaptic site for these changes.","Accumulative evidence indicates that acute (before extinction) and long-lasting (during extinction) depression can occur at excitatory synapses in mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during re-exposure to a tone (conditioned stimulus: CS), previously paired with footshock (unconditioned stimulus: US).

"It has been demonstrated previously that lesions to medial prefrontal cortex in rats impair the shifting of attentional set between perceptual features of complex stimuli [J. Neurosci. 20 (2000) 4320], a result that mirrors the deficit found in humans and monkeys [Nature 380 (1996) 69; Behav. Neurosci. 110 (1996) 872; J. Neurosci. 17 (1997) 9285; Neuropsychologia 29 (1991) 993]. These data imply functional homology between rat medial prefrontal cortex and primate prefrontal cortex.In marmoset monkeys, there is a double dissociation between the effects of lesions of lateral prefrontal cortex, which impair shifting of attentional set, and lesions of orbital prefrontal cortex, which result in impairments of reversal of stimulus-reward contingencies, leaving attentional set-shifting capacities intact [Nature 380 (1996) 69; Behav. Neurosci. 110 (1996) 872; J. Neurosci. 17 (1997) 9285]. The present investigation examined whether lesions to rat orbital prefrontal cortex would produce deficits in reversal learning in the absence of deficits in shifting attentional set, as seen in monkeys. Rats were trained to perform an attentional set-shifting task that is formally the same as that used in monkeys and humans. In a single session, rats performed a series of discriminations, including acquisitions and reversals. Damage to orbital prefrontal cortex in the rats did not disrupt the ability to acquire, maintain or shift attentional set. We report here the same selective impairment in reversal learning in rats as seen in primates with orbital prefrontal cortex lesions.","It has been demonstrated previously that lesions to medial prefrontal cortex in rats impair the shifting of attentional set between perceptual features of complex stimuli [J.

Neurosci. 17 (1997) 9285; Neuropsychologia 29 (1991) 993]. These data imply functional homology between rat medial prefrontal cortex and primate prefrontal cortex. In marmoset monkeys, there is a double dissociation between the effects of lesions of lateral prefrontal cortex, which impair shifting of attentional set, and lesions of orbital prefrontal cortex, which result in impairments of reversal of stimulus-reward contingencies, leaving attentional set-shifting capacities intact [Nature 380 (1996) 69; Behav. Neurosci. 110 (1996) 872; J. Neurosci. 17 (1997) 9285].","The present investigation examined whether lesions to rat orbital prefrontal cortex would produce deficits in reversal learning in the absence of deficits in shifting attentional set, as seen in monkeys. Rats were trained to perform an attentional set-shifting task that is formally the same as that used in monkeys and humans. In a single session, rats performed a series of discriminations, including acquisitions and reversals.","Damage to orbital prefrontal cortex in the rats did not disrupt the ability to acquire, maintain or shift attentional set. We report here the same selective impairment in reversal learning in rats as seen in primates with orbital prefrontal cortex lesions.",1,1,1,"Damage to orbital prefrontal cortex in the rats did not disrupt the ability to acquire, maintain or shift attentional set.

"It is becoming increasingly apparent that multiple functions of the frontal cortex such as inhibitory control and executive attention are likely sustained by its functionally distinct and interacting sub-regions but the precise localization of dissociable executive processes has proved difficult and controversial. In the present series of studies, we investigated the behavioural effects of bilateral excitotoxic lesions of different regions of the rat neocortex in the 5-choice serial reaction time task. Whereas lesions of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) impaired performance of the task as revealed by a reduction in discriminative accuracy, lesions made to distinct ventral regions of the frontal cortex showed selective deficits in inhibitory measures of control. Specifically, the infralimbic lesion produced increases in premature responding that was accompanied by fast response latencies. By comparison, the orbitofrontal lesion showed perseverative tendencies particularly when the inter-trial interval was made long and unpredictable, a challenge that would normally promote premature responding instead. These different behavioural effects following dorsal and ventral lesions of the rodent frontal cortex signifies the integrity of the frontal cortex in multiple executive mechanisms that work independently and complementarily by which performance is optimized. Furthermore, these data provide new insights into the functional organization of the rodent frontal cortex with a particular emphasis on localization of function.",It is becoming increasingly apparent that multiple functions of the frontal cortex such as inhibitory control and executive attention are likely sustained by its functionally distinct and interacting sub-regions but the precise localization of dissociable executive processes has proved difficult and controversial.,"In the present series of studies, we investigated the behavioural effects of bilateral excitotoxic lesions of different regions of the rat neocortex in the 5-choice serial reaction time task.

"Several years ago, we found that lesions of ventral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFCv) disrupted performance during the extinction component of a classical fear conditioning task without affecting acquisition performance. We called this emotional perseveration, hypothesizing that mPFCv may normally act to inhibit fear responses to a conditioned stimulus (CS) when the CS no longer signals danger. Subsequent studies have supported this hypothesis, showing that mPFCv is crucial for the memory of prior extinction training. The present study examined the effects of mPFCv lesions made after training. Such lesions resulted in reduced freezing to contextual stimuli and normal responding to the CS presented alone during a retention test. Rats were then subjected to extinction trials (CS without US) over multiple days. In contrast to pre-training lesions, post-training lesions had little effect on extinction rate. All rats were given additional training. Lesioned rats expressed greater fear reactions than controls, indicating that prior extinction was less effective in them. Lesioned rats also showed resistance to extinction during reextinction trials, confirming our earlier finding that lesions made before training weaken the effectiveness of extinction trials. These results suggest three conclusions. First, an intact mPFCv during acquisition may protect the animal from prolonged responding during extinction trials following brain insult. Second, changes in mPFCv may predispose subjects toward enhanced fear reactions that are difficult to extinguish when reexposed to fearful stimuli, due to a diminished capacity to benefit from the fear-reducing impact of prior extinction experience. Third, contextual cues processed by mPFCv may influence extinction performance.","Several years ago, we found that lesions of ventral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFCv) disrupted performance during the extinction component of a classical fear conditioning task without affecting acquisition performance.

"The 'stop-signal' task measures the ability to inhibit a response that has already been initiated, i.e. the ability to stop. Human subjects who have been classified as 'impulsive', for example, those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are slower to react to the stop signal, and are often less sensitive to changes in the timing of signals to stop. Imaging studies have implicated fronto-striatal circuitry in the mediation of this form of response control. We report inhibition functions on the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) task for normal rats, and following damage to the medial prefrontal cortex or to the nucleus accumbens core. Neither group of excitotoxic lesions produced significant deficits on task performance. Subsequent treatment with D-amphetamine (0.3 and 1.0mg/kg) resulted in quicker go-trial reaction times (mRT) overall, but had no significant effect on SSRT. Neither medial prefrontal cortex nor nucleus accumbens lesions had any differential effects on performance following D-amphetamine. These results are discussed with respect to the fronto-striatal circuitry involved in the mediation of behavioural inhibition.","The 'stop-signal' task measures the ability to inhibit a response that has already been initiated, i.e. the ability to stop.

"In order to test an attribute specificity model of prefrontal cortex function, rats with lesions in the prelimbic-infralimbic (PL-IL) or anterior cingulate and precentral (AC-PC) subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex and controls were trained on an object-place paired associate task. Rats with AC-PC lesions acquired the task as readily as controls. In contrast, the PL-IL lesioned rats did not learn the task. Whenever higher order processing is required to solve a task, the data support an attribute-specificity model of prefrontal cortex function in that the PL-IL cortices support both object and place attribute information in a variety of tasks including object-place paired associate learning.","In order to test an attribute specificity model of prefrontal cortex function, rats with lesions in the prelimbic-infralimbic (PL-IL) or anterior cingulate and precentral (AC-PC) subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex and controls were trained on an object-place paired associate task.","Rats with AC-PC lesions acquired the task as readily as controls.

Previous studies have shown that when the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is removed at 7-10 days of age there is a spontaneous filling of the lesion cavity and a nearly complete restitution of behaviour. In the current study animals received mPFC lesions on postnatal day 10 and on day 160 the tissue occupying the mPFC region was again removed. Behavioural performance on the Morris water task was compared to animals with either only day 10 mPFC lesions or only day 160 mPFC lesions. Rats with the combined day 10 and day 160 lesions or day 160 lesions were severely impaired at the task whereas the rats with only day 10 lesions showed complete recovery. An analysis of dendritic arborization in pyramidal neurons adjacent to the lesion showed increased dendritic arborization in the basilar fields in both the P10 groups but this was not associated with functional recovery in the animals with the two mPFC lesions. It thus appears that the tissue that filled in the mPFC lesions on day 10 was functional.,Previous studies have shown that when the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is removed at 7-10 days of age there is a spontaneous filling of the lesion cavity and a nearly complete restitution of behaviour.,In the current study animals received mPFC lesions on postnatal day 10 and on day 160 the tissue occupying the mPFC region was again removed.

"The lack of a single anatomical or functional definition of 'prefrontal cortex' has led to different and, in some respects, controversial views on the existence of a prefrontal cortex in non-primate mammals, in particular in rats. Until the classic paper by Rose and Woolsey [Res. Publ. Assoc. Nerv. Ment. Dis. 27 (1948) 210], the general idea was that a prefrontal cortex is unique to primate species. Rose and Woolsey's 'prefrontal cortex' definition was based upon a single anatomical criterion, i.e. the cortical projection area of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. Single criteria, however, do not appear to be sufficient for defining the prefrontal cortex. Therefore, other anatomical and functional characteristics are currently used to identify the prefrontal cortex in different species. Yet, recently the debate about the nature of the prefrontal cortex in non-primate species has been resumed. In the present paper we will compare the structural and functional characteristics of the prefrontal cortex of nonhuman primates and rats. We will argue that rats have a functionally divided prefrontal cortex that includes not only features of the medial and orbital areas in primates, but also some features of the primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.","The lack of a single anatomical or functional definition of 'prefrontal cortex' has led to different and, in some respects, controversial views on the existence of a prefrontal cortex in non-primate mammals, in particular in rats.

"Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a major component of neuronal membranes. In rats, low brain levels of DHA during development produce alterations in the mesocortical and mesolimbic dopamine systems. In this study, male Long-Evans rats (n = 6-7 per group) were raised from conception on diets with (control) or without alpha-linolenic acid, the dietary precursor of DHA. The deficient diet reduced brain DHA to 80% of that of control animals at maturity. At weaning (P21), half of the pups from each deficient litter were changed to a remediation diet enriched in DHA by the addition of fish oil. Beginning at P56, rats were subjected to a battery of behavioral tests. Catalepsy induced by haloperidol (3mg/kg, i.p.) in deficient animals was 49% of that observed in control animals (P &lt; 0.05). Catalepsy in remediated animals was similar to that observed for control animals. In a test of locomotor activity in a novel environment, deficient animals exhibited 187% of the activity of control animals (P &lt; 0.05). Locomotor activity stimulated by d-amphetamine (0.5mg/kg, s.c.) in deficient animals was 145% of that observed in control animals (P &lt; 0.05). Basal and amphetamine-stimulated activity of remediated animals was similar to that of deficient animals. Response to a thermal stimulus was not different between groups. These findings demonstrate that rats exposed from conception to a diet that produces a relatively modest decrease in brain DHA content exhibit alterations in adult behavior indicative of altered dopaminergic function. Some of these behavioral alterations were reversed by dietary remediation initiated at weaning.","Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a major component of neuronal membranes.

"The availability of pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells for gene targeting has resulted in laboratory mice becoming important animal models of human neurological disease. Inbred strains of mice differ in many behavioural phenotypes, such that the same gene mutation can appear to have different phenotypic effects when introduced onto different genetic backgrounds. Prior knowledge of the behavioural phenotypes of the inbred strains used for gene targeting would, therefore, allow the selection of the most appropriate genetic background for the hypothesis to be tested. With this in mind, we tested eight strains of mice (129S1/SvImJ, 129S2/SvPasIcoCrlBR, 129S6/SvEvTac, B6129SF1/J, C57BL/6J, C57BL/6N, LP/J and SM/J), including the sources of five ES cell lines commonly used for gene targeting, in the spatial (submerged platform) version of the Morris water maze, the most widely used paradigm to evaluate the cognitive abilities of genetically modified mice. The three 129 substrain sources of ES cell lines demonstrated spatial learning in the water maze that was superior to that of C57BL/6J, the inbred strain most commonly used for the maintenance and phenotypic testing of mutations. In addition, 129S6/SvEvTac was unique amongst the eight strains tested in having a particular capacity for reversal learning, when the submerged platform was relocated to the opposite quadrant. We conclude that some substrains of 129 could provide suitable genetic backgrounds for testing gene mutations that might be expected to impair cognitive function, thus negating the need to backcross to C57BL/6J, thereby avoiding the so-called ""flanking gene problem"".","The availability of pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells for gene targeting has resulted in laboratory mice becoming important animal models of human neurological disease.

"These experiments examined the relationship between freezing and c-Fos expression in the amygdala. In Experiment 1 freezing was elevated during a period immediately following shock in rats that remained in the shock context, but not in rats that were moved to a different, neutral context. The two groups showed equally elevated c-Fos levels in both the central (CeA) and lateral (LA) nuclei. In Experiment 2 rats were shocked in one compartment (paired) and not shocked in another, distinct compartment (unpaired). Rats re-exposed to the paired compartment 24h later froze more than rats exposed to the unpaired compartment, and rats in both groups froze more than un-shocked rats. c-Fos protein expression in CeA, LA and basolateral (BLA) nucleus was elevated in the rats exposed to the paired compartment but not in rats exposed to the unpaired compartment. Thus, c-Fos expression was induced by exposure to both unconditioned and conditioned stimuli, although it is unclear if the same cell population was activated in both cases. Neither case of c-Fos expression coincided with the occurrence of freezing. c-Fos expression may represent neural activity in LA and CeA produced by exposure to unconditioned cues and activity in BLA, LA and CeA produced by conditioned cues.

"The effects of the 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonist, ketanserin, and the 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist, SB 206553, on lordosis behavior were investigated in ovariectomized rats hormonally primed with estradiol benzoate (EB) (0.5 or 25 microg) and progesterone (500 microg). Both ketanserin and SB 206553 inhibited lordosis behavior after infusion into the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN), but ketanserin was slightly more effective than the 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist. Either drug was more effective in rats primed with 0.5 microg EB than in rats hormonally primed with 25 microg EB. These findings support the suggestion that estrogen may enhance functioning of the 5-HT(2) receptor family and thereby protect against the 5-HT(2) receptor antagonists. These data are consistent with prior suggestions that estrogen modulates functioning of 5-HT(2) receptors within the VMN and that 5-HT(2) receptors play a facilitatory role in the modulation of female rat lordosis behavior.","The effects of the 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonist, ketanserin, and the 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist, SB 206553, on lordosis behavior were investigated in ovariectomized rats hormonally primed with estradiol benzoate (EB) (0.5 or 25 microg) and progesterone (500 microg).","Both ketanserin and SB 206553 inhibited lordosis behavior after infusion into the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN), but ketanserin was slightly more effective than the 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist.

"Previous studies have shown that the presence of hippocampal theta activity is important for learning and memory, and that the medial supramammillary nucleus (mSuM) is involved in the control of the frequency of theta rhythm. It has also been shown that the depression of mSuM activity by chlordiazepoxide causes modest impairment of spatial learning. On the other hand, the lateral supramammillary nucleus (lSum) increases long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal population spikes. However, to our knowledge, no reports exist concerning the role of the supramammillary area (SuM) in passive avoidance (PA) learning. In the present study, rats were chronically implanted with a cannula aimed at SuM and were trained on a step-through PA task. They received intra-SuM injection of lidocaine or saline at the following intervals: 5 min before training, 5, 90, and 360 min after the acquisition trial, or 5 min before the retrieval test. When lidocaine was injected 5 min before training there was no effect on acquisition of PA but retrieval was significantly poorer than the control group injected with saline. Lidocaine injection 5 min after the acquisition trial impaired PA retention, but reversible inactivation of SuM at 90 and 360 min after training and 5 min before the retrieval test showed no significant effect on PA retention. It can be concluded that SuM contributes to PA consolidation at least 5 min after the acquisition trial and that this effect may be accomplished through SuM projections to the septal and/or hippocampal areas participating in the PA memorization processes.","Previous studies have shown that the presence of hippocampal theta activity is important for learning and memory, and that the medial supramammillary nucleus (mSuM) is involved in the control of the frequency of theta rhythm.

Body weight, food intake, carcass analysis and plasma levels of leptin and insulin were measured. Male Drd3-/- mice have increased body weight and body fat when given access to high fat (HF) diet but not standard rodent chow. The female Drd3-/- mice did not demonstrate increased body weight when given access to either diet, but did have increased body fat on both diets. Plasma leptin and insulin levels reflected the increased adiposity demonstrated in each genotype and gender. These findings suggest the D3-R signaling is involved in the regulation of body weight and body fat when mice are given access to diets differing in palatability and fat content.",Dopamine (DA) signaling has been implicated in the control of energy balance and ingestive behavior.,"In the present study, we sought to characterize body weight, body fat and food intake regulation in a mouse with a targeted disruption of the dopamine-3 receptor gene (Drd3).

"Virgin rabbits exposed to foster pups for 14 days did not show maternal responsiveness. However, surgical removal of the accessory olfactory bulbs (AOB) activated maternal responsiveness (crouching over the litter inside the nest box for about 3min, which is the normal duration of a nursing bout) in 37% of virgin rabbits (P &lt; 0.007). This behavior appeared abruptly and was first observed between days 3 and 13 of pup exposure. This variation in the latency to respond maternally was not related with the number of sniffings or entrances into the nest box displayed by a female on the days that preceded crouching over the litter. Maternal responsiveness was not observed in any AOB-lesioned animals that were also ovariectomized (P &lt; 0.02 versus AOB-lesioned with ovaries). These results indicate a tonic inhibitory action of the AOB over the expression of maternal behavior in virgin rabbits and a stimulation of maternal responsiveness by ovarian hormones following AOB lesions.",Virgin rabbits exposed to foster pups for 14 days did not show maternal responsiveness.,"However, surgical removal of the accessory olfactory bulbs (AOB) activated maternal responsiveness (crouching over the litter inside the nest box for about 3min, which is the normal duration of a nursing bout) in 37% of virgin rabbits (P &lt; 0.007).

"Among cocaine addicts, there is a strong variation in response to relapse provoking factors like conditioned cues and renewed contact with the drug. Here we show that such large individual differences also exist in rats. Reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior was triggered by contingent presentation of a cocaine-conditioned cue or an amphetamine priming injection. We found no positive correlation between cue- and drug-controlled reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Rather, a slight, but significant negative correlation was observed, which was particularly evident in two subgroups of rats that responded highest following either amphetamine priming or cue presentation. A large middle group responded equally for both relapse provoking factors. Further, cocaine-seeking behavior during the first extinction session correlated positively with cue-induced reinstatement. In conclusion, the present findings indicate that the therapeutic efficacy of relapse prevention strategies may depend on individual sensitivity to distinct relapse provoking stimuli.","Among cocaine addicts, there is a strong variation in response to relapse provoking factors like conditioned cues and renewed contact with the drug.

"Core and shell regions of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) have been implicated in different aspects of goal-directed behavior. To assess these differences at the neuronal level, we evaluated core and shell single-unit activity in eight rats during one-trial, free-choice entry into a novel compartment. Changes in firing rate during approach of (orientation toward) and entry into (nose cross) novelty were assessed relative to a pre-novelty baseline when the animals were behaviorally active. Increases and decreases in neuronal activity were recorded in both regions during both phases of the novelty response. The regional distribution of these responses, however, was significantly different during the approach phase with roughly equal proportions of neuronal excitations (8/29) and inhibitions (6/29) in core but a shift away from excitation (2/40) toward inhibition (12/40) in shell. No regional differences emerged during subsequent approach of the familiar compartment from the novel chamber or during entry to either the novel or familiar compartment. Taken together, our results during approach to free-choice novelty indicate a regional dissociation in NAcc firing rate may play a role in appetitive behavior.",Core and shell regions of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) have been implicated in different aspects of goal-directed behavior.,"To assess these differences at the neuronal level, we evaluated core and shell single-unit activity in eight rats during one-trial, free-choice entry into a novel compartment.

"We used magnetic source imaging (MSI) to investigate the spatio-temporal patterns of brain activity associated with line bisection judgments and double simultaneous visual stimulation in 14 healthy adults. Consistent with lesion and hemodynamic neuroimaging studies, we found the greatest number of activity sources in right inferior parietal cortex. These sources were most prominent, on average, between 200 and 300 ms after the onset of single (left, right, or center) target stimuli. A greater number of significant activity sources were found in right inferior parietal, occipital, and prefrontal cortices during bilateral compared with unilateral stimulus presentation. Based on these observations, we suggest that a more parsimonious physiological explanation of visual extinction than the hemispheric rivalry account may be the additional neuronal excitation required in right occipital and parietal cortices for accurate bilateral visual perception.",nan,We used magnetic source imaging (MSI) to investigate the spatio-temporal patterns of brain activity associated with line bisection judgments and double simultaneous visual stimulation in 14 healthy adults.,"Consistent with lesion and hemodynamic neuroimaging studies, we found the greatest number of activity sources in right inferior parietal cortex.

"Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a normal reduction in the startle response produced when a brief, low intensity stimulus is presented prior to a startle-evoking stimulus. PPI is often disrupted in humans diagnosed with schizophrenia. As similar stimuli elicit PPI in rodents and humans, interventions in rodents that disrupt PPI may reveal aspects of neuronal dysfunction relevant to schizophrenia. Stimulation of the ventral hippocampus (vHip) with NMDA significantly increases dopamine (DA) efflux in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and disrupts PPI, whereas NMDA infusion into the dorsal hippocampus (dHip) fails to alter PPI. Our previous research shows that brief periods of 20 Hz electrical vHip stimulation also significantly increase NAc DA efflux. The present experiments assessed the effects of stimulating the vHip or dHip on PPI and NAc DA efflux. As predicted, 20 Hz stimulation (10 s, 300 microA) of the vHip, but not the dHip, reversibly disrupted PPI. In contrast, 2 Hz stimulation (100 s, 300 microA) of the vHip failed to affect PPI. Microdialysis experiments revealed that 20 Hz stimulation of the vHip increased NAc DA efflux only in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulating electrode, whereas 20 Hz stimulation of the dHip failed to affect NAc DA efflux. These data demonstrate the regional specificity and frequency-dependent effects of hippocampal activity on PPI. Additionally, it is intriguing that both chemical and electrical stimulation of the vHip disrupt PPI and increase NAc DA efflux, however, the relevance of these changes in NAc DA efflux to the disruption of PPI remains to be determined.","Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a normal reduction in the startle response produced when a brief, low intensity stimulus is presented prior to a startle-evoking stimulus.

"Brain alpha1-adrenoceptors that participate in behavioral activation were mapped in the mouse brain by determining where microinjection of the alpha1-antagonist, terazosin, inhibited behavioral activity in a novel cage test. A total of 5 out of 23 tested regions were shown to be involved including the dorsal pons/locus coeruleus region (DP/LC), the dorsal raphe/periaqueductal gray area (DR/PAG), the vermis cerebellum (CER), the nucleus accumbens (ACC) and the medial preoptic area (MPOA). Injection in the 4th ventricle was also effective perhaps by acting on several of these regions simultaneously. A partial inhibition was obtained from the motor cortex. Coinjection of the alpha1/2-agonist, 6-fluoronorepinephrine (6FNE) but not the alpha2-agonist, dexmedetomidine (DMT) reversed the behavioral inhibition in all regions. It is hypothesized that brain motoric alpha1-receptors elicit behavioral activation by coordinately exciting several monoaminergic, motor and motivational systems.","Brain alpha1-adrenoceptors that participate in behavioral activation were mapped in the mouse brain by determining where microinjection of the alpha1-antagonist, terazosin, inhibited behavioral activity in a novel cage test.","A total of 5 out of 23 tested regions were shown to be involved including the dorsal pons/locus coeruleus region (DP/LC), the dorsal raphe/periaqueductal gray area (DR/PAG), the vermis cerebellum (CER), the nucleus accumbens (ACC) and the medial preoptic area (MPOA).

"The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of environmental novelty on amphetamine discrimination. Two groups of rats (home group and novelty group) were trained to perform water-reinforced operant behavior in cages equipped with two levers and a retractable liquid dipper (0.1cc cup). The experimental procedures for the two groups were identical except for the fact that home rats were housed and tested in the operant cages whereas novelty rats were transferred daily to these cages for the testing sessions (25min). The rats were trained to discriminate one of two doses of amphetamine (0.25 and 0.5mg/kg) from saline. Saline and amphetamine were administered intraperitoneally immediately before each daily session according to a semi-random schedule for a total of 50 sessions. Reinforcements were delivered according to a fixed ratio that was increased daily from 2 to 30. Successful drug discrimination was achieved when activity on the appropriate lever before the first reinforcement was greater than 80% of total activity, on at least seven out of eight consecutive sessions. When training was conducted with 0.25mg/kg of amphetamine, no home rat acquired drug discrimination whereas 56% of novelty rats reached criterion. When training was conducted with 0.5mg/kg of amphetamine, drug discrimination was achieved by 50% of home rat versus 86% of novelty rats. These findings indicate that environmental novelty can alter the ability of amphetamine to produce interoceptive cues.",The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of environmental novelty on amphetamine discrimination.,"Two groups of rats (home group and novelty group) were trained to perform water-reinforced operant behavior in cages equipped with two levers and a retractable liquid dipper (0.1cc cup).

"In the present high-resolution electroencephalographic (EEG) study, an omitted-stimulus paradigm induced a strong expectancy for a predictable painful stimulation (nonpainful in the control condition). During the expectancy of pain, concurrent cognitive demands were superimposed. The aim was to investigate the effects on primary sensorimotor and central midline areas of the competition among concurrent attentional processes related to cognition and pain expectancy, as indexed by behavioral performance and EEG data. A main issue was whether cognitive performance decreases, due to a re-allocation of attentional resources on primary sensorimotor and midline areas for the anticipation of pain. Behavioral results showed no differences in the cognitive (working memory) performance during the expectancy of nonpainful versus painful stimulations. In parallel, anticipatory event-related potentials (ERPs) were negligible in line with a low emotional reactivity/alertness as revealed by heart rate deceleration (HRD), skin conductance response (SCR), and low-band (6-10Hz) alpha EEG oscillations. In contrast, high-band alpha EEG oscillations (10-12Hz) over the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex decreased more during the expectancy of painful compared to nonpainful stimuli, in line with an increased anticipatory preparation of the somatosensory channel. These findings provide further evidence on the fact that attentional processes at the basis of cognition can be defended by the anticipation of pain, at least when the incoming painful stimuli are repetitive and predictable. This happens even if the brain increases preparatory processes of the specific sensory channel to be targeted by the painful stimulus.","In the present high-resolution electroencephalographic (EEG) study, an omitted-stimulus paradigm induced a strong expectancy for a predictable painful stimulation (nonpainful in the control condition).

"Six rhesus monkeys were tested for a change in reaction time for problem-solving during a learning-set task, in which they showed progressive improvement in the rate of learning successive problems of visual discrimination. To evaluate the processing time for cognitive processes in problem-solving, the differences in release latency and movement time between the visual discrimination task and the visuomotor control task were defined. In their first experience, the monkeys required several hundreds of trials for solving the problem, and the Deltarelease latency was constant throughout the learning. With increasing experience, they solved problems within fewer trials than with the first problem. At this stage, the Deltarelease latency was high at the beginning and then decreased. The rise in the Deltarelease latency within the learning acquisition period increased depending on the amount of experience with problems they had solved, whereas the Deltamovement time within that period was not significantly affected by the experience with problems. The present findings suggest that the number of problem-solving experiences could promote profound cognitive processing, which may be related to a conceptual representation that actualizes the flexibility of learning, namely, the learning set.","Six rhesus monkeys were tested for a change in reaction time for problem-solving during a learning-set task, in which they showed progressive improvement in the rate of learning successive problems of visual discrimination.","To evaluate the processing time for cognitive processes in problem-solving, the differences in release latency and movement time between the visual discrimination task and the visuomotor control task were defined.

"Repetitive exposure to opioids elicits sensitization to its locomotor stimulating effects. Several lines of evidence have shown that the central GABAergic system is involved in behavioral sensitization induced by morphine. Valproate, a clinically widely used anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer, can mainly inhibit gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase and activate glutamic acid decarboxylase, which result in decrease in the degradation and increase in the synthesis of GABA, and then the elevation of extracellular GABA in the central nervous system. However, the effects of valproate on behavioral sensitization to morphine have not been documented. Herein, we investigated the effects of valproate on the induction and the expression of behavioral sensitization to morphine. Mice treated daily for 7 days with 10 mg/kg morphine and challenged with the same dose after 7 days of washout showed increased locomotor activity. Co-administration of valproate (37.5, 75, 150 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.)), at doses that did not affect the spontaneous activity, 30 min prior to morphine dose-dependently inhibited the induction of morphine sensitization. However, neither single nor multiple administration (37.5, 75, 150 mg/kg x 7 injections) of valproate had any effect on the expression of morphine sensitization once it developed. Our results indicated that GABA plays an important role in the induction, but not in the expression of morphine sensitization in mice.","Repetitive exposure to opioids elicits sensitization to its locomotor stimulating effects.

"Chronic low dose MPTP-treated monkeys develop difficulty in performing spatial working memory tasks. Since these tasks have both attentional and memory components, the extent to which task performance deficits are attentional or memory in nature was examined.

These findings suggest that procedures to enhance attention may be useful in ameliorating some of the ""memory"" deficits associated with early Parkinson's disease.","Chronic low dose MPTP-treated monkeys develop difficulty in performing spatial working memory tasks.

"Repeated treatment with dopamine (DA) receptor agonists strongly potentiates contralateral turning behavior due to selective stimulation of D1 or D2-class receptors in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats. This phenomenon, referred to as sensitization, is believed to be related to the motor response complications (dyskinesias, on-off states) that occur during chronic administration of levodopa in Parkinson's disease patients. In recent years a new method for the evaluation of abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) secondary to dopaminergic stimulation in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats was described. These AIMs resemble dyskinesias as seen in parkinsonian patients under levodopa therapy. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of repeated treatment with different regimes of DA agonists on turning behavior and on an AIMs scale in 6-OHDA lesioned rats, with the aim of discriminating between drugs with different dyskinesia-inducing potential. In addition, we explored the effects of a previous exposure to a DA agonist (priming) on the behavioral response to the subsequent administration of a DA agonist with the same or different pharmacologic profile. Our results show that in apomorphine-treated rats, rotational behavior and AIMs run a parallel course of enhancement, while in those receiving quinpirole there is a dissociation, suggesting that they could be mediated by different mechanisms. The finding of a significant priming effect on subsequent testing of 6-OHDA lesioned rats should be borne in mind as the use of these pharmacological tests in the screening of well lesioned animals could lead to an erroneous interpretation of further results on dyskinesias and rotational behavior.","Repeated treatment with dopamine (DA) receptor agonists strongly potentiates contralateral turning behavior due to selective stimulation of D1 or D2-class receptors in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats.

In addition, we explored the effects of a previous exposure to a DA agonist (priming) on the behavioral response to the subsequent administration of a DA agonist with the same or different pharmacologic profile.","Our results show that in apomorphine-treated rats, rotational behavior and AIMs run a parallel course of enhancement, while in those receiving quinpirole there is a dissociation, suggesting that they could be mediated by different mechanisms. The finding of a significant priming effect on subsequent testing of 6-OHDA lesioned rats should be borne in mind as the use of these pharmacological tests in the screening of well lesioned animals could lead to an erroneous interpretation of further results on dyskinesias and rotational behavior.",1,1,1,"Our results show that in apomorphine-treated rats, rotational behavior and AIMs run a parallel course of enhancement, while in those receiving quinpirole there is an apparent association, suggesting that they could be mediated by similar mechanisms.

"We have previously reported that monoclonal antibody (mAb) IN-1 treatment after ischemic infarct in adult rats results in significant recovery of skilled forelimb use. Such recovery was correlated with axonal outgrowth from the intact, opposite motor cortex into deafferented subcortical motor areas. In the present study, we investigated the effects of mAb IN-1 treatment after adult sensorimotor cortex (SMC) aspiration lesion on behavioral recovery and neuroanatomical plasticity in the corticospinal tract. Adult rats underwent unilateral SMC aspiration lesion and treatment with either mAb IN-1 or a control Ab, or no treatment. Animals were then tested over a 6-week period in the skilled forelimb use task and the skilled ladder rung walking task. We found that animals treated with mAb IN-1 after SMC lesion fully recovered the use of forelimb reaching, but showed no improvement in digit grasping as tested in the skilled forelimb use task. The mAb IN-1 treatment group was also significantly improved as compared to control groups in the skilled ladder rung walking test. Furthermore, neuroanatomical tracing revealed a significant increase in the corticospinal projections into the deafferented motor areas of the spinal cord after mAb IN-1 treatment. These results indicate that treatment with mAb IN-1 after cortical aspiration lesion induces remodeling of motor pathways resulting in recovery in only certain behavioral tasks, suggesting that the cause of brain damage influences behavioral recovery after mAb IN-1 treatment.","We have previously reported that monoclonal antibody (mAb) IN-1 treatment after ischemic infarct in adult rats results in significant recovery of skilled forelimb use.

"Polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) is predominantly expressed during development where it regulates biological functions including axon targeting and neuronal precursor cell migration. Although dramatically down regulated after birth in most regions of the nervous system, PSA-NCAM remains highly expressed into adulthood in areas that have ongoing regeneration and plasticity such as in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus. Consequently, lack of PSA-NCAM in NCAM null mice results in distinct morphological changes to these areas. The functional correlates of these changes are not well defined although there have been reports that learning is impaired in NCAM null mice. In the present study, we assessed the ability of old and young NCAM null mice to learn an odour discrimination task. We tested male and female experimental and control animals of two different ages: 30-60 days and 12-15 months. During 4 days of training, NCAM null and C57BL/6J received trials where one odour (CS+) was paired with sugar while another odour (CS-) was not. In a subsequent preference test, conducted in the absence of sugar, all animals, regardless of strain or age, spent significantly more time digging in the CS+ odour than in the CS- odour. In addition, there was no significant difference in digging behaviour in the CS+ between the NCAM null and the control animals. These data indicate that deletion of the NCAM gene may change the morphology of the olfactory bulb but does not interfere with the ability to learn an odour discrimination task.","Polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) is predominantly expressed during development where it regulates biological functions including axon targeting and neuronal precursor cell migration.

"In the present study, we investigated how the neurosteroid, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) affects the development of morphine dependence and tolerance in mice. Mice administered morphine (10 mg/kg) twice a day for 5 days developed tolerance to the analgesic effect and dependence as shown by a severe withdrawal syndrome induced by naloxone. Co-administration of DHEAS (10 mg/kg) with morphine significantly inhibited the development, but not the expression, of tolerance to morphine-induced analgesia and the naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. The expression of c-fos mRNA was observed in the frontal cortex and thalamus of mice showing signs of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal, while the expression of c-fos mRNA was significantly diminished by co-administration of DHEAS with morphine. On the naloxone-precipitated withdrawal, mice showed a significant elevation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels in the thalamus, whereas chronic administration of DHEAS with morphine did not affect the increase in cAMP. Interestingly, repeated co-administration of DHEAS with morphine prevented the withdrawal-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) 2 in the frontal cortex. These results showed that DHEAS prevented the development of morphine tolerance and dependence and suggested that the attenuating effects of DHEAS might result from the regulation of c-fos mRNA expression, which is possibly involved the signaling activation of ERK, but not of cAMP pathway.","In the present study, we investigated how the neurosteroid, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) affects the development of morphine dependence and tolerance in mice.","Mice administered morphine (10 mg/kg) twice a day for 5 days developed tolerance to the analgesic effect and dependence as shown by a severe withdrawal syndrome induced by naloxone.

"We investigated how dizocilpine, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, affects the development of morphine dependence in mice. Co-administration of dizocilpine (0.25 mg/kg) and morphine (10 mg/kg) for 5 days attenuated the development of tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine. The withdrawal manifestation induced by the naloxone-challenge (5 mg/kg) was significantly reduced in mice that were treated with a combination of dizocilpine and morphine, compared to the mice treated with morphine and saline. The present study revealed a significant increase in c-Fos protein expression in the cortex and thalamus of mice showing naloxone-precipitated withdrawal syndrome. The combination of dizocilpine and morphine prevented the increase of c-Fos protein expression in the cortex and thalamus. Interestingly, repeated co-administration of dizocilpine and morphine prevented the withdrawal-induced phosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II (p-CaMK II) in the cortex, but not in the thalamus. Acute dizocilpine treatment prior to the naloxone-challenge and repeated treatment with dizocilpine alone had no effect on analgesia, withdrawal manifestations, p-CaMK II levels or c-Fos protein levels. These results showed that co-administration of dizocilpine and morphine prevented the development of morphine tolerance and dependence and suggested that the preventive effect of dizocilpine results from the regulation of c-Fos protein expression, which is possibly involved in the activation of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent signal cascade in the cortex.","We investigated how dizocilpine, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, affects the development of morphine dependence in mice.","Co-administration of dizocilpine (0.25 mg/kg) and morphine (10 mg/kg) for 5 days attenuated the development of tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine.

"The present study investigated the effects of post-weaning social isolation (SI) on behavioural and neuroendocrine reactivity to stress of male and female rats. Innate aspects of fear and anxiety were assessed in the open field and elevated plus maze tests. Spontaneous startle reflex and conditioned fear response were further investigated. The neuroendocrine response of isolates was examined by measuring basal and stress release of ACTH and corticosterone and by evaluating the mRNA expression of mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors using in situ hybridization. Locomotor activity in the open field was not modified by chronic SI. In males, but not females, SI produced an anxiogenic profile in the elevated plus maze. Male isolates showed a trend towards increased startle reflex amplitude relative to socially-reared controls. Moreover, SI in males produced alterations of the HPA axis functioning as reflected by higher basal levels of ACTH, and enhanced release of ACTH and corticosterone following stress. In contrast, startle response or HPA axis functioning were not altered in female isolates. Social isolates from both genders showed reduced contextual fear-conditioning. Finally, the mRNA expression of MR and GR was not modified by SI.

"Environmental enrichment induces structural and biochemical changes in the brains of mammals that correlate with improved learning and memory. Research in rats suggests that social compared to inanimate stimulation might affect behavior differently, by acting upon dissociable neural substrates. Here we tested this hypothesis at the behavioral level by examining whether social and inanimate stimulation affect spatial memory formation and non-spatial discrimination reversal learning selectively. Spatial memory formation is known to depend on hippocampal-neocortical pathways, whereas reversal learning depends primarily on prefrontal cortico-striatal pathways. Male Lister hooded rats were housed singly or in groups of three in either small barren or large enriched cages, from weaning onwards. After 10 weeks of differential housing, spatial learning and memory were examined in the Morris water maze, followed by a series of tactile and odour discriminations, including discrimination reversal, in a two-choice discrimination task. Regardless of inanimate stimulation, social deprivation affected neither the acquisition of simple or complex discriminations, nor spatial memory formation, but was associated with impaired reversal learning in the two-choice discrimination task. By contrast, inanimate deprivation, regardless of social stimulation, affected neither acquisition nor reversal of two-choice discriminations, but selectively delayed the acquisition of spatial memory in the Morris water maze. This is the first demonstration of a double dissociation of early social and inanimate stimulation on two distinct behavioural functions that are mediated by dissociable underlying neural pathways. These findings strengthen the view that social and inanimate stimulation act, at least in part, upon dissociable neural substrates.","Environmental enrichment induces structural and biochemical changes in the brains of mammals that correlate with improved learning and memory.

"Environmental enrichment promotes structural and functional changes in the brain, including enhanced learning and memory performance in rodents. Transient global cerebral ischemia (15 min) causes specific damage to dorsal hippocampal area CA1 pyramidal cells of the rat concomitantly with cognitive deficits. Thus, we investigated if environmental enrichment can protect rats against the cognitive and neurological consequences of transient ischemia. We evaluated the impairment of learning and memory with three tasks: odour discrimination, object exploration and spatial learning. Contrary to expectation, we found that the enriched environment improved performances for both ischemic and sham rats in odour discrimination and object exploration tasks compared with standard condition housed rats. After exposure to an enriched environment, ischemic rats performed better in the water maze than those in the standard housing conditions. However, exposure to an enriched environment does not protect against actual loss of CA1 pyramidal cells. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were increased in environmental enrichment animals compared to those housed in standard conditions. We conclude that environmental enrichment has positive effects that are independent of the effects of ischemic brain lesions.","Environmental enrichment promotes structural and functional changes in the brain, including enhanced learning and memory performance in rodents.

"Sleep depends on the quantity and quality of the diet. Several studies have shown that food deprivation results in a reduction in sleep duration. It has also been demonstrated that in the newborn, the supply of certain essential amino acids improves sleep through their action on the synthesis of specific neurotransmitters. The aim of the present study was to test if the quantity and/or quality of dietary protein could improve the recovery of sleep during re-feeding after caloric deprivation. Sleep parameters were compared in rats fed ad libitum, food restricted during 4 days, or reefed isocalorically after food restriction with three dietary regimens varying in terms of the amount (14% versus 30%) or quality (milk protein or alpha-lactalbumin) of protein. The results showed that sleep recovery, in particular slow-wave sleep, was improved in rats re-fed with alpha-lactalbumin. This result confirms the close relationship between feeding and sleep and suggest that alpha-lactabumin could be used to improve sleep in adult submitted to nutritional disturbances such as food restriction, shift work, Ramadan.","Sleep depends on the quantity and quality of the diet.

"Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by severe degeneration of basal ganglia, motor abnormalities, impaired cognitive functions and emotional disturbances. Intrastriatal injection of the excitotoxin quinolinic acid (QA), an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist, appears to reproduce in rats some of the clinical features of human HD, included motor and behavioural deficits. Aim of this study was to assess whether the behavioural alterations described in the QA rat model of HD progressed over time. We analysed the effects of bilateral striatal injection of QA (300 nmol/1 microl) to adult rats in the spatial open-field test, a nonaversive task in which exploratory activity and responses to both spatial rearrangement of familiar objects and object novelty are measured. Rats were tested 2 weeks, 2 and 6 months after the QA lesion. Lesioned rats showed progressive alterations in performance in this task. Whereas sham and QA rats did not markedly differ 2 weeks post-lesion, lesioned rats were significantly more active than controls 2 and 6 months after surgery. Specifically, frequency and duration of rearing and wall rearing increased progressively over time, while grooming was enhanced at 2 months post-lesion only. Spatial and object novelty discrimination was not affected. These results show that a single injection of QA excitotoxin can induce behavioural changes that progress over time. The main implication of these findings is that, besides genetic mice models of HD, QA-lesioned rats may represent a suitable mean to test the ability of new drugs to slow down disease progression.","Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by severe degeneration of basal ganglia, motor abnormalities, impaired cognitive functions and emotional disturbances.

"The behaviour of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) may model attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. For example, SHR are hyperactive in an open field and show high terminal rates of responding on certain fixed-interval schedules. Open field behaviour has been dissociated from the accompanying spontaneous hypertension but fixed interval responding has not. We compared the fixed interval responding of two unrelated strains of genetically hypertensive rat, the SHR (n = 6) and the New Zealand genetically hypertensive rat (GH, n = 5), with their normotensive control strains, the Wistar Kyoto (WKY, n = 6) and Wistar (n = 5), respectively. Both hypertensive rat strains showed increased terminal lever-pressing rates on a multiple fixed-interval schedule (FI-EXT) compared to controls. In order to investigate the association of hypertension and the behavioural characteristics in question, an F-2 hybrid strain was obtained by cross-breeding GH and Wistar rats. When these F-2 hybrids (n = 33) were tested on the FI-EXT schedule, terminal lever-pressing rate was not correlated with blood pressure. The independent segregation of these phenotypical characteristics in the hybrids suggests independent genetic control. By contrast, other behavioural characteristics, including high lever-pressing rates during the extinction component and a tendency to emit responses in bursts, did cosegregate with terminal lever-pressing rates. Taken together, these findings suggest that the genetic loci for high blood pressure and responding on the FI-EXT schedule in these two unrelated rat strains are close but distinct.","The behaviour of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) may model attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.

"Several studies suggest that classification of piglets early in life based on the degree of resistance they display in a so-called Backtest may be indicative of their coping style at a later age. In the present study behavioural flexibility was investigated in pigs diverging for Backtest response and housing environment during rearing. Pigs were housed either without a rooting substrate (barren housing, B) or in identical pens enriched with deep straw bedding (enriched housing, E) from birth. During the suckling period piglets were subjected to the Backtest. Each piglet was restrained on its back for 1 min and the resistance (i.e. number of escape attempts) was scored. Pigs classified as 'high-resisting' (HR) or as 'low-resisting' (LR) were subjected to a simple (left/right) spatial discrimination (T-maze) task at 8 weeks of age. The effect of a single, subtle intramaze change was determined after acquisition of the task. In addition, pigs were subjected to reversal learning to assess their ability to modulate established behaviour patterns. Housing and its interaction with Backtest classification influenced the behavioural response to the intramaze change: E pigs were considerably more distracted than B pigs. Housing condition affected LR pigs more than HR pigs, as indicated by the interaction effects on various recorded behaviours. These interactions indicate that behavioural responding of pigs with diverging coping characteristics cannot simply be generalised across rearing conditions. Furthermore, HR pigs were less successful in reversal learning than LR pigs, suggesting that they have a higher propensity to develop inflexible behavioural routines.",Several studies suggest that classification of piglets early in life based on the degree of resistance they display in a so-called Backtest may be indicative of their coping style at a later age. In the present study behavioural flexibility was investigated in pigs diverging for Backtest response and housing environment during rearing.,"Pigs were housed either without a rooting substrate (barren housing, B) or in identical pens enriched with deep straw bedding (enriched housing, E) from birth. During the suckling period piglets were subjected to the Backtest. Each piglet was restrained on its back for 1 min and the resistance (i.e. number of escape attempts) was scored. Pigs classified as 'high-resisting' (HR) or as 'low-resisting' (LR) were subjected to a simple (left/right) spatial discrimination (T-maze) task at 8 weeks of age. The effect of a single, subtle intramaze change was determined after acquisition of the task. In addition, pigs were subjected to reversal learning to assess their ability to modulate established behaviour patterns.","Housing and its interaction with Backtest classification influenced the behavioural response to the intramaze change: E pigs were considerably more distracted than B pigs.

"The influence of prepulses on the acoustic startle response (ASR) was measured in three inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J, 129/SvHsd, and AKR/OlaHsd, and one hybrid strain produced by crossing wild mice and NMRI mice. Prepulse inhibition (PPI), i.e. reduction of ASR by prepulses, was maximal when the interval between prepulses and startle stimuli was in the range of 37.5-100 ms. Prepulse facilitation (PPF), i.e. increase of ASR by prepulses, was maximal when the prepulse preceded the startle stimulus by 12.5 ms. PPI increased with increasing prepulse SPL, PPF first increased then decreased when prepulse SPL was increased. Percent PPI was independent from startle stimulus SPL. All strains showed a long-term increase of PPI when tested for several days; one strain (129) also showed an increase of PPF over days. The present results clearly show that PPI and PPF are independent processes, which add to yield the final response change. PPF and the observed long-term changes of PPI and PPF are stronger expressed in mice than have been observed in rats under similar conditions. Since there were significant differences between the strains of mice with respect to PPI and PPF, genetically different strains of mice are a promising tool to study these two processes.","The influence of prepulses on the acoustic startle response (ASR) was measured in three inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J, 129/SvHsd, and AKR/OlaHsd, and one hybrid strain produced by crossing wild mice and NMRI mice.","Prepulse inhibition (PPI), i.e. reduction of ASR by prepulses, was maximal when the interval between prepulses and startle stimuli was in the range of 37.5-100 ms.

"To determine whether monkeys can navigate a virtual environment, and whether they can represent a virtual environment in their brain, we trained two macaque monkeys to perform a navigation task in a virtual building and conducted behavioral analyses. After learning the task from the first starting point, they were trained to perform the navigation task from a second starting point which is already familiar to them during the first training session. The second training was completed faster than the first one. Furthermore, we found that the time required for a free-way-finding test from a novel starting point was shortened after the second training. These results suggest that monkeys can navigate a virtual environment and can construct a flexible representation of a virtual environment in their brain.","To determine whether monkeys can navigate a virtual environment, and whether they can represent a virtual environment in their brain, we trained two macaque monkeys to perform a navigation task in a virtual building and conducted behavioral analyses.","After learning the task from the first starting point, they were trained to perform the navigation task from a second starting point which is already familiar to them during the first training session.","The second training was completed faster than the first one.

"In addition to their well-known genomic effects via intracellular receptors, androgens rapidly alter neuronal excitability through a nongenomic pathway. The nongenomic effect of testosterone, as the main androgen, apart from its traditional effects, was assessed in one of the fundamental centers of learning and memory, the hippocampus, on long-term memory (LTM) in passive avoidance conditioning. Different doses of testosterone enanthate (T) or testosterone-BSA (T-BSA) bilaterally were injected into the CA1 region of the hippocampus 15 min before shock delivery (1 mA during 5 s) in a two-compartment passive avoidance apparatus. After 24 h, animals were tested for passive avoidance retrieval. Bilateral injection of 20 microg T or 55 microg T-BSA into the CA1 significantly decreases step-through latency. Therefore, it seems that testosterone can impair LTM in passive avoidance conditioning both via intracellular receptors and through nongenomic pathway.","In addition to their well-known genomic effects via intracellular receptors, androgens rapidly alter neuronal excitability through a nongenomic pathway.

"Male and female hooded rats were intraperitoneally injected with 0 (vehicle only), 5 or 10 mg/kg D-cycloserine (DCS) and then individually allowed free access to the arms of a Y maze (acquisition trial), one of which was black and the other white. Their ability to later recognize the arm that had changed from white to black was assessed from the first arm entered, and the number of times the novel changed arm was repeatedly entered as well as the total time they spent in this arm. DCS increased the number of times the novel arm was entered first and, at the higher dose, repeated entries of and time spent in this arm by female rats. Males showed increases after the lower but not higher dose. In a second experiment, DCS was administered after rather than before the acquisition trial. With the exception of the first arm entered for males only, DCS did not significantly affect choices of the novel arm. However, contrary to treatment with vehicle, such choices were significantly higher than chance expectancies after 5 mg/kg DCS, thereby indicating that the treated rats were able to recognize the novel arm. It was concluded that, in the first experiment, DCS had mainly improved attention and/or encoding, and had slightly enhanced memory in the second. Any effects on memory were most likely due to prevention of forgetting. There was also evidence of anxiolytic effects of DCS that may have facilitated responses to both arms without affecting specific choices of the novel alternative.","Male and female hooded rats were intraperitoneally injected with 0 (vehicle only), 5 or 10 mg/kg D-cycloserine (DCS) and then individually allowed free access to the arms of a Y maze (acquisition trial), one of which was black and the other white.","Their ability to later recognize the arm that had changed from white to black was assessed from the first arm entered, and the number of times the novel changed arm was repeatedly entered as well as the total time they spent in this arm.

"Variability in behavior is often put in an unfavorable light as a marker of lack of skill. Here, we provide evidence that increased variability during preferred patterns of coordination is associated with higher flexibility in adopting new patterns. Twelve right-handed subjects performed cyclical bimanual flexion and extension patterns with four homologous and six heterologous joint combinations involving shoulder, elbow, wrist, and finger movements. Preferred (isofrequency) as well as less preferred (multifrequency) coordination patterns were studied. The findings revealed less accurate and less stable 1:1 coordination patterns during heterologous as compared to homologous limb segment combinations. Conversely, coordination patterns with a 2:1 frequency ratio were performed more accurately and more consistently during heterologous as compared to homologous conditions. Accordingly, a lower degree of coupling between effectors during performance of preferred coordination patterns was associated with more successful performance of less familiar patterns. This suggests that variability may promote the creative exploration of new performance modes.","Variability in behavior is often put in an unfavorable light as a marker of lack of skill.

"While prefrontal lesions in rodents serve as models for frontal lobe syndromes, neonatal lesions are considered as models for disconnection syndromes, such as schizophrenia. We investigated the effect of neonatal lesions of the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) together with pubertal dexamethasone-challenge on adult rat behaviour and on apomorphine-induced behavioural changes. Adult lesions were used as controls. Rats with neonatal (postnatal day 7) or adult excitotoxic lesions or sham-lesions of the mPFC were tested 9 weeks after surgery. At postnatal day 49 one group of neonatal operated rats were systemically injected with the glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone (20 mg/kg), in order to simulate stress-induced glucocorticoid receptor activation. Working memory and perseveration was tested in T-maze tasks (continuous delayed alternation and reversal learning). Additionally, locomotor activity and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle was tested with and without apomorphine-treatment. Brain tissue damage was assessed using Nissl-staining and parvalbumine-immunocytochemistry. Pronounced thinning of the prelimbic-infralimbic subregion of the mPFC accompanied by altered cytoarchitecture and reduced number of parvalbumine-immunopositive neurones was found after neonatal lesions while adult lesions resulted in loss of neurones accompanied by gliosis. Neonatal lesions increased perseveration in the T-maze tasks and enhanced PPI, while adult lesions induced a working memory deficit. This differential behavioural outcome presumably reflects neurodevelopmentally induced alterations in neuronal circuits after neonatal lesions versus damage to mPFC alone after adult lesions. Dexamethasone-injection at day 49 did not alter behaviour in these tasks. Motor activity was not affected by neonatal or adult lesions but dexamethasone reduced apomorphine-induced hyperlocomotion.","While prefrontal lesions in rodents serve as models for frontal lobe syndromes, neonatal lesions are considered as models for disconnection syndromes, such as schizophrenia.

"Histamine-containing neurons of the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) are implicated in facilitating wakefulness. They project to many brain areas, including the cholinergic basal forebrain (BF). The cholinergic magnocellular regions of the BF are important in the regulation of cortical arousal and wakefulness, and a role for histamine in this activity is suggested by in vitro data indicating histamine excites BF cholinergic and non-cholinergic neurons. To test the hypothesis that histamine induces wakefulness via actions in the BF, we performed microdialysis perfusion of different concentrations of histamine (100, 500 and 1000 microM) in the BF of Sprague-Dawley rats. A MANOVA analysis showed that histamine produced a highly statistically significant and dose-dependent increase in wakefulness and decrease in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep compared with artificial cerebrospinal fluid perfusion. From a wakefulness baseline percentage time of about 12% with artificial cerebrospinal fluid, histamine perfusion increased this value to 26% (100 microM), 36% (500 microM), or 47% (1000 microM). There was no statistically significant change in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Histamine perfusion (500 microM) in a control site, the centromedian thalamic nucleus, did not produce any change in behavioral state. The results indicate a prominent role of histamine in wakefulness regulation via the BF and further support the hypothesis that the BF has an important role in EEG activation and wakefulness.","Histamine-containing neurons of the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) are implicated in facilitating wakefulness.

"The aim of this study was to investigate whether heterozygous reeler mice (+/rl) could be used as a genetic mouse model of schizophrenia, as previously suggested [J. Med. Chem. 44 (2001) 477]. The behavioural phenotype of male and female +/rl mice (young adult: 50-70 days old, and fully adult: &gt;75 days old) was compared to their wild type (+/+) littermates. A complex behavioural test battery was employed: Irwin test, rotarod, spontaneous locomotor activity, social behaviour, light-dark transition test, startle response and prepulse inhibition, and hot-plate test. Overall, +/rl mice did not differ from their +/+ littermates at either age, although fully adult +/rl male mice spent more time engaged in social investigation. Some of the behavioural measures investigated were influenced by gender. Young female mice were more active in the light/dark transition test than males, while males were more aggressive than females during social interaction. In addition, performance on the rotarod was shown to deteriorate with age. Our data are in agreement with previous findings [Soc. Neurosci. Abst. 27 (2001) 238; J.

"Although lesion studies suggest that the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFc) is involved in the process necessary for reversal of a particular set of contingencies, the nature of lesion-induced deficits is unclear. The involvement of rat mPFc in reversal of a simple spatial discrimination was examined in the present study. Our hypothesis was that lesion-induced deficits may reflect a failure to inhibit a learned instrumental response. Lister Hooded rats were trained on a spatial discrimination task (SD), which required a correct barpress matching the cue location, then they were trained on reversal of SD (SDR), which required a correct barpress opposite to the cue location. Rats with mPFc lesions showed a slower learning rate compared to the controls. However, behavior of the lesioned rats during early and later reversal differed. During the initial SDR, the lesioned rats showed a greater number of barpresses during the intertrial interval and a slightly higher percent correct responses than that of the controls. Our data suggest that damage to mPFc may produce a lack of response inhibition, leading to an increase in nondiscriminated bapresses, thereby yielding a 'facilitation' during early reversal. mPFc lesion did not affect either open field activity or prepulse inhibition (PPI), a frequently used measure of sensorimotor gating. Disruption of reversal learning following damage to mPFc is partly due to a failure to inhibit instrumental responses, rather than to disruption of other processes involved in sensorimotor gating or general activity.","Although lesion studies suggest that the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFc) is involved in the process necessary for reversal of a particular set of contingencies, the nature of lesion-induced deficits is unclear.

"Citalopram, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) is one of the widely used antidepressants. Apart from its antidepressant activity citalopram is also used for anxiety, panic disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder and behavioral disturbances of dementia. Tremor is the second most common neurological adverse effect in patients receiving treatment with SSRIs. Use of these agents in depressed patients with essential tremor has not been studied. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of chronic citalopram treatment on harmaline-induced tremors in rats. Female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 70+/-2 g were given citalopram in doses of 0, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg by gavage for 2 weeks. On the 15th day, the rats were given harmaline (10 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min after the last dose of citalopram. The latency of onset, intensity and duration of tremor and EMG were recorded. Serotonin (5HT) and 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid (5HIAA) were measured in brain stem. Citalopram dose dependently exacerbated the duration, intensity and amplitude of EMG of harmaline-induced tremor. A significant decrease in 5HT turnover (5HIAA/5HT ratio) in the brain stem was observed suggesting a possible role of serotoninergic impairment in citalopram-induced augmentation of harmaline-induced tremor. Clinical implications of these observations warrant further investigation.","Citalopram, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) is one of the widely used antidepressants.

"The cell bodies of 5-HT containing neurons that innervate the limbic forebrain are mainly found in the dorsal raphe nucleus and in the median raphe nucleus (MRN). To assess the role of the median raphe nucleus in anxiety, rats bearing either electrolytic or 5-HT-selective neurotoxic lesion of the MRN were tested in the elevated T-maze. This apparatus consists of two opposed open arms perpendicular to one enclosed arm. Two tasks are performed in succession by the same rat in one experimental session, namely inhibitory avoidance of the open arm, taken as a measure of conditioned anxiety and one-way escape from the open arm, considered as a measure of unconditioned fear. The test was performed 7 days after the electrolytic lesion (3 mA, 10s) or 14 days after the neurotoxic lesion (5,7-DHT, 8 microg/1 microl). The results showed that while the electrolytic lesion impaired both inhibitory avoidance and one-way escape, the neurotoxic lesion impaired only inhibitory avoidance. Therefore, serotonergic pathways originating in the MRN seem to participate in the modulation of conditioned anxiety but not unconditioned fear. Other neurotransmitter systems that either originate in or pass through the MRN may regulate unconditioned fear.","The cell bodies of 5-HT containing neurons that innervate the limbic forebrain are mainly found in the dorsal raphe nucleus and in the median raphe nucleus (MRN). To assess the role of the median raphe nucleus in anxiety, rats bearing either electrolytic or 5-HT-selective neurotoxic lesion of the MRN were tested in the elevated T-maze.","This apparatus consists of two opposed open arms perpendicular to one enclosed arm. Two tasks are performed in succession by the same rat in one experimental session, namely inhibitory avoidance of the open arm, taken as a measure of conditioned anxiety and one-way escape from the open arm, considered as a measure of unconditioned fear. The test was performed 7 days after the electrolytic lesion (3 mA, 10s) or 14 days after the neurotoxic lesion (5,7-DHT, 8 microg/1 microl).","The results showed that while the electrolytic lesion impaired both inhibitory avoidance and one-way escape, the neurotoxic lesion impaired only inhibitory avoidance. Therefore, serotonergic pathways originating in the MRN seem to participate in the modulation of conditioned anxiety but not unconditioned fear. Other neurotransmitter systems that either originate in or pass through the MRN may regulate unconditioned fear.",1,1,1,"The results showed that while the electrolytic lesion impaired both inhibitory avoidance and one-way escape, the neurotoxic lesion enhanced inhibitory avoidance.

"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) system displays more than 14 receptors subtypes on brain areas involved in learning and memory processes, and pharmacological manipulation of specific receptors selectively affects memory formation. In order to begin the search of 5-HT receptors expression during memory formation, in this work, we aimed to determine, by autoradiography (using 3H 5-HT as ligand, 2 nM, specific activity 123 Ci/mmol), 5-HT receptors (5-HTR) expression in passive (untrained) and autoshaping trained (3 sessions) adult (3 months) and old (9 months) male rats. Thus, trained adult rats had better retention than old animals. Raphe nuclei of adult and old trained rats expressed less receptors on medial and dorsal, respectively. Hippocampal CA1 area and dentate gyrus of adult trained rats expressed less 5-HTR, while dentate gyrus of old increased them. Basomedial amygdaloid nucleus in old trained rats expressed more 5-HTR; while in the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus they were augmented in both groups. Training decreased or did not change 5-HTR in caudate-putamen of adult or old animals. The above profile of 5-HTR expression is consistent with previous reports, and suggests that memory formation and aging modulates 5-HTR expression in brain areas relevant to memory systems.","Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) system displays more than 14 receptors subtypes on brain areas involved in learning and memory processes, and pharmacological manipulation of specific receptors selectively affects memory formation.

"To investigate the functional role of alpha1d-adrenergic receptor (alpha1d-AR) in the CNS, we have generated mutant mice lacking the alpha1d-AR using a gene targeting approach and examined in detail the effects of alpha1d-AR knockout mice on motor function, sensory function, and learning and memory. alpha1d-AR knockout mice showed better motor coordination at the highest rotating speed of the rotarod performance and stronger muscle tone using the traction meter, but their locomotor activity and swimming ability in the water maze were not affected. In the water maze requiring reference memory, alpha1d-AR knockout mice showed normal spatial learning. In the Y-maze task requiring working memory or attention, alpha1d-AR knockout mice displayed an impaired spontaneous alternation performance. The alpha1d-AR knockout mice tended to display lower levels of acoustic startle responses than the wild-type group at lower pulse intensities, although the acoustic prepulse inhibition was not impaired in the alpha1d-AR knockout mice. Furthermore, the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801-induced deficits of acoustic prepulse inhibition were not observed in the alpha1d-AR knockout mice. These results clearly demonstrate that the alpha1d-AR receptor plays an important role in the process of auditory sensory function, attention or working memory rather than reference memory, and the sensorimotor gating deficits induced by the NMDA receptor antagonist.","To investigate the functional role of alpha1d-adrenergic receptor (alpha1d-AR) in the CNS, we have generated mutant mice lacking the alpha1d-AR using a gene targeting approach and examined in detail the effects of alpha1d-AR knockout mice on motor function, sensory function, and learning and memory.","alpha1d-AR knockout mice showed better motor coordination at the highest rotating speed of the rotarod performance and stronger muscle tone using the traction meter, but their locomotor activity and swimming ability in the water maze were not affected.

"Individual differences in novelty-induced exploratory activity identify rats which can serve as a model of human sensation-seeking, risk-taking behaviour. Experimentally na&#xef;ve rats, when exposed to mild stress of a novel environment, exhibit variability in their exploratory activity. Some rats display high rates of locomotor reactivity to novelty (high responders (HR)), and others display low rates (low responders (LR)). The LRHR phenotype is a reliable predictor of drug-taking behaviour and is linked to differences in hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression. In this study, we investigated whether the LRHR phenotype is associated with differences in the quantitative morphology of the hippocampal field CA3, dentate gyrus molecular layer, granule cell layer and mossy fibres. LRs and HRs showed no significant differences in the volumes of CA3 and dentate molecular layer volume or the number of dentate granule cells. However, LRs had a significantly larger suprapyramidal mossy fibre terminal field volume when compared to HRs. The infrapyramidal mossy fibres did not differ between phenotypes. Also, we found a LRHR phenotype-independent significant negative correlation between molecular layer volume per granule cell and the total number of granule cells. These findings implicate the SP-MF in vulnerability for risk-taking behaviour, and we propose that LR and HR hippocampi may differ in the way novelty information is processed.","Individual differences in novelty-induced exploratory activity identify rats which can serve as a model of human sensation-seeking, risk-taking behaviour.

"Histamine H3 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists have been proposed as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of a number of neurological disorders ranging from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Alzheimer's disease to narcolepsy and schizophrenia. With respect to the latter, schizophrenic patients typically exhibit impaired prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle, a reflex that can be modeled in many animal species. Certain strains of mice naturally display poor PPI and it was recently suggested that these mice might offer a new way to screen for novel antipsychotic compounds. To examine whether H3 receptor antagonists might enhance PPI in mice with naturally occurring deficits, DBA/2 and C57BL/6 were tested in a startle paradigm with three prepulse intensities: 5, 10 and 15 dB above background. Both thioperamide and ciproxifan enhanced PPI in the DBA/2 strain; thioperamide also showed a trend towards enhancing PPI in C57BL/6. Risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic, enhanced PPI in both the DBA/2 and the C57BL/6 strain. These data confirm previous reports describing a natural deficit in PPI in some mouse strains that is amenable to enhancement with known antipsychotics. Further, these data suggest that H3 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists have anti-psychotic potential for disorders such as schizophrenia.","Histamine H3 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists have been proposed as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of a number of neurological disorders ranging from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Alzheimer's disease to narcolepsy and schizophrenia.

"Several studies have pointed out that the mu opioid receptor (MOR) can play a key role in some of the behavioural effects of ethanol. In the present study, the implication of the MOR in ethanol-induced locomotion in mice was assessed. First, the effects of the administration of different naltrexone doses (0.001-1.000 mg/kg) on the locomotor changes produced by ethanol (2.5 g/kg) were evaluated. In a second set of experiments, the ability of repeated naltrexone (6 mg/kg) administrations to modify the effects of ethanol was also assessed on mice locomotion. The results of the present study revealed that an acute naltrexone administration reduced dose-dependently ethanol-induced locomotion. Conversely, after repeated naltrexone injections, a transient boost of ethanol induced locomotor activity was observed. Thus, the results of the present study revealed that the effects of these naltrexone pretreatments on ethanol-induced locomotion are similar to the previously described changes on MOR activity. Moreover, the same (acute and chronic) naltrexone pretreatments produced similar changes on the locomotion of mice after a challenge with morphine (a MOR agonist), but not after tert-butanol (an alcohol which does not release beta-endorphins) administration. Therefore, our results are discussed in terms of the proved ability of ethanol to promote the release of beta-endorphins and, consequently, to activate the MOR.",Several studies have pointed out that the mu opioid receptor (MOR) can play a key role in some of the behavioural effects of ethanol.,"In the present study, the implication of the MOR in ethanol-induced locomotion in mice was assessed.

"The peripheral hormone epinephrine (EPI) is known to modulate memory for arousing experiences. The mnemonic effects of EPI are attributed almost exclusively to actions on amygdala noradrenergic (NE) systems. EPI also increases neuronal activity in the locus coeruleus (LC), the primary source of NE to other limbic structures that process memory such as the hippocampus (HIPP). The actions of EPI on the LC suggest that its mnemonic properties may also be mediated by influencing NE output in the HIPP. To test this hypothesis, dialysate levels of NE were collected from the HIPP of male rats given an i.p. injection of saline that was followed 100 min later by i.p. EPI (0.3 mg/kg). NE levels sampled 20 min after EPI injection were significantly larger than baseline and continued to show significant peaks for 60 min. Experiment 2 examined whether peripheral signals initiated by EPI influence the HIPP via the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) by inactivating this nucleus with lidocaine prior to EPI injection. EPI injection did not increase NE levels sampled from the HIPP of rats given lidocaine into the NTS. EPI injection did produce significant elevations in HIPP NE levels in animals given a control solution into the NTS prior to the EPI injection. These findings indicate that the mnemonic effects of EPI reported in a wide range of learning conditions may not be mediated solely by NE release in the amygdala, but may also involve coactivation of the HIPP NE system.","The peripheral hormone epinephrine (EPI) is known to modulate memory for arousing experiences.

"Pavlovian autoshaping procedures provide for pairings of a small object conditioned stimulus (CS) with a rewarding substance unconditioned stimulus (US), resulting in the acquisition of complex sequences of CS-directed skeletal-motor responses or autoshaping conditioned responses (CRs). Autoshaping procedures induce higher post-session levels of corticosterone than in controls receiving CS and US randomly, and the enhanced post-session corticosterone levels have been attributed to the appetitive or arousal-inducing effects of autoshaping procedures. Enhanced corticosterone release can be induced by aversive stimulation or stressful situations, where it is often accompanied by higher levels of norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) in prefrontal cortex (PFC) but not in striatum (ST). Effects of autoshaping procedures on post-session corticosterone levels, NE contents in PFC, and 5-HT contents in PFC and ST were investigated in male Long-Evans rats. Post-session blood samples revealed higher corticosterone levels in the CS-US Paired group (n = 46) than in the CS-US Random control group (n = 21), and brain samples revealed higher levels of PFC NE and 5-HT in CS-US Paired group. Striatal 5-HT levels were unaltered by the autoshaping procedures. Autoshaping procedures provide for appetitive stimulation and induce an arousal-like state, as well as simultaneous stress-like changes in plasma corticosterone and monoamine levels in PFC. Autoshaping, therefore, may be useful for the study of endocrine and central processes associated with appetitive conditions.","Pavlovian autoshaping procedures provide for pairings of a small object conditioned stimulus (CS) with a rewarding substance unconditioned stimulus (US), resulting in the acquisition of complex sequences of CS-directed skeletal-motor responses or autoshaping conditioned responses (CRs).

"The protein L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate)-O-methyltransferase participates in the repair of age-induced protein damage by initiating the conversion of abnormal aspartyl residues within proteins to normal L-aspartyl residues. Previous studies have shown that mice deficient in the gene encoding this enzyme (Pcmt1-/-) accumulate damaged proteins, have altered levels of brain S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), and suffer from epileptic seizures that result in death at an average age of about 42 days. In this study, we found that the behavior of Pcmt1-/- mice is abnormal in comparison to their wild-type (Pcmt1+/+) and heterozygous (Pcmt1+/-) littermates in two standard quantitative behavioral assays - the accelerating rotorod and the open-field test. On the accelerating rotorod, we found Pcmt1-/- mice actually perform significantly better than their heterozygous and wild-type littermates, a situation that has only been infrequently described in the literature and has not been described to date for epilepsy-prone mice. The Pcmt1-/- mice show, however, hyperactivity in the open-field test that becomes more pronounced with age, with a partial habituation with time in the chamber. Additionally, these mice demonstrate a strong thigmotaxic movement pattern. We present evidence that these phenotypes are not related to the alterations of the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio in the brain and thus may be a function of the accumulation of damaged proteins. These results implicate a role for this enzyme in motor coordination and cerebellum development and suggest the importance of the function of the repair methyltransferase in hippocampal-dependent spatial learning.","The protein L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate)-O-methyltransferase participates in the repair of age-induced protein damage by initiating the conversion of abnormal aspartyl residues within proteins to normal L-aspartyl residues.

"To investigate the emotional role of the cerebellum of fish, we conducted experiments examining effects of cerebellar manipulations on fear-related classical heart rate conditioning in goldfish. We performed total ablation of the corpus cerebelli to examine the effect of irreversible effects. We also performed localized cooling of the corpus cerebelli, in place of the ablation, for reversible inactivation of the cerebellar function. Both the cardiac arousal response to the first presentation of the conditioned stimulus and the cardiac reflex to the aversive unconditioned stimulus were not impaired by the ablation or cooling of the corpus cerebelli. On the other hand, inactivation of cerebellar function severely impaired the acquisition of a conditioned cardiac response in the fear-related conditioning. In addition, localized cooling of the corpus cerebelli reversibly suppressed the expression of established conditioned response. We suggest that the cerebellum of fish is not only being a motor coordination center but also is involved in emotional learning.","To investigate the emotional role of the cerebellum of fish, we conducted experiments examining effects of cerebellar manipulations on fear-related classical heart rate conditioning in goldfish.","We performed total ablation of the corpus cerebelli to examine the effect of irreversible effects.

"ErbB4 is an important brain receptor for the neuregulin1 growth factor.

"The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has increased in the United States and more patients are seeking CAM therapies for control of pain. The present investigation tested the efficacy of orally administered anthocyanins extracted from tart cherries on inflammation-induced pain behavior in rats. Paw withdrawal latency to radiant heat and paw withdrawal threshold to von Frey probes were measured. The first set of experiments examined the effects of tart cherry anthocyanins (400 mg/kg) on the nociceptive behaviors and edema associated with inflammation induced by intraplantar injection of 1% carrageenan. These studies also included tests of motor coordination. The second set of experiments determined if tart cherry anthocyanins (15, 85, and 400 mg/kg) dose-dependently affected the inflammation induced by intraplantar injection of 25% complete Freund's adjuvant. We found that tart cherry extracts reduce inflammation-induced thermal hyperalgesia, mechanical hyperalgesia and paw edema. The suppression of thermal hyperalgesia was dose-dependent and the efficacy of highest dose (400 mg/kg) was similar to indomethacin (5 mg/kg). The highest dose anthocyanin (400 mg/kg) had no effects on motor function. These data suggest that tart cherry anthocyanins may have a beneficial role in the treatment of inflammatory pain. The antihyperalgesic effects may be related to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of anthocyanins. A better understanding of the modulatory role of dietary constituents and phytonutrients on pain will offer further therapeutic options for treating patients with persistent and chronic pain conditions.",The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has increased in the United States and more patients are seeking CAM therapies for control of pain. A better understanding of the modulatory role of dietary constituents and phytonutrients on pain will offer further therapeutic options for treating patients with persistent and chronic pain conditions.,"The present investigation tested the efficacy of orally administered anthocyanins extracted from tart cherries on inflammation-induced pain behavior in rats. Paw withdrawal latency to radiant heat and paw withdrawal threshold to von Frey probes were measured. The first set of experiments examined the effects of tart cherry anthocyanins (400 mg/kg) on the nociceptive behaviors and edema associated with inflammation induced by intraplantar injection of 1% carrageenan. These studies also included tests of motor coordination. The second set of experiments determined if tart cherry anthocyanins (15, 85, and 400 mg/kg) dose-dependently affected the inflammation induced by intraplantar injection of 25% complete Freund's adjuvant.","We found that tart cherry extracts reduce inflammation-induced thermal hyperalgesia, mechanical hyperalgesia and paw edema. The suppression of thermal hyperalgesia was dose-dependent and the efficacy of highest dose (400 mg/kg) was similar to indomethacin (5 mg/kg). The highest dose anthocyanin (400 mg/kg) had no effects on motor function. These data suggest that tart cherry anthocyanins may have a beneficial role in the treatment of inflammatory pain. The antihyperalgesic effects may be related to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of anthocyanins.",1,0,1,"We found that tart cherry extracts increase inflammation-induced thermal hyperalgesia, mechanical hyperalgesia and paw edema.
