[{"method":"Only 1 compound, riluzole, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for ALS; several therapies are in clinical trials, including 2 mesenchymal stem cell trials.","background":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal degenerative disorder of motoneurons, which may occur concurrently with frontotemporal dementia. Genetic analyses of the &#x223c;10% of ALS cases that are dominantly inherited provide insight into ALS pathobiology. Two broad themes are evident. One, prompted by investigations of the SOD1 gene, is that conformational instability of proteins triggers downstream neurotoxic processes. The second, from studies of the TDP43, FUS, and C9orf72 genes, is that perturbations of RNA processing can be highly adverse in motoneurons. Several investigations support the concept that non-neuronal cells (microglia, astroglia, oligodendroglia) participate in the degenerative process in ALS. Recent data also emphasize the importance of molecular events in the axon and distal motoneuron terminals.","conclusion":"The challenges and unmet needs in ALS emphasize the importance of new research directions: high-throughput sequencing of large DNA sets of familial and sporadic ALS, which will define scores of candidate ALS genes and pathways and facilitate studies of epistasis and epigenetics; infrastructures for candidate gene validation, including in vitro and in vivo modeling; valid biomarkers that elucidate causative molecular events and accelerate clinical trials; and in the long term, methods to identify environmental toxins. The unprecedented intensity of research in ALS and the advent of extraordinary technologies (rapid, inexpensive DNA sequencing; stem cell production from skin-derived fibroblasts; silencing of miscreant mutant genes) bode well for discovery of innovative ALS therapies."},{"method":"Genetic analysis revealed a canine rabies virus variant found only in the patient's home country, and the patient had not traveled internationally since immigrating to the United States.","background":"Eight years after emigrating from Brazil, an otherwise healthy man developed rabies.

It may also induce facilitation of non-nociceptive A&#x3b2; fibers and nociceptive A&#x3b4; fibers, giving rise to dynamic mechanical allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia. In postherpetic neuralgia and complex regional pain syndrome, for example, these symptoms are maintained and modulated by peripheral nociceptive input. Diagnosing central sensitization can be particularly difficult. In addition to the medical history, quantitative sensory testing and functional magnetic resonance imaging may be useful, but diagnostic criteria that include both subjective and objective measures of central augmentation are needed.","background":"Many pain states begin with damage to tissue and\/or nerves in the periphery, leading to enhanced transmitter release within the spinal cord and central sensitization. Manifestations of this central sensitization are windup and long-term potentiation. Hyperexcitable spinal neurons show reduced thresholds, greater evoked responses, increased receptive field sizes, and ongoing stimulus-independent activity; these changes probably underlie the allodynia, hyperalgesia, and spontaneous pain seen in patients. Central sensitization is maintained by continuing input from the periphery, but also modulated by descending controls, both inhibitory and facilitatory, from the midbrain and brainstem. The projections of sensitized spinal neurons to the brain, in turn, alter the processing of painful messages by higher centers. Several mechanisms contribute to central sensitization.","conclusion":"Mounting evidence indicates that treatment strategies that desensitize the peripheral and central nervous systems are required. These should generally involve a multimodal approach, so that therapies may target the peripheral drivers of central sensitization and\/or the central consequences."},{"method":"Here we report on durable clinical remissions after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in 2 patients suffering from severe forms of the disease.

Unconsciousness, induced by altered arousal and\/or cognition, is perhaps the most fascinating behavioral state of general anesthesia.","conclusion":"Each altered arousal state results from the anesthetic drugs acting at multiple targets in the central nervous system. Our analysis shows that general anesthesia is less mysterious than currently believed."},{"method":"Animal models of Nf1 identified mechanisms and pathways that are required for cognition, and represent an important complement to the complex neuropsychological literature on learning disabilities associated with this condition.","background":"Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1) is a single-gene disorder characterized by a high incidence of complex cognitive symptoms, including learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, executive function deficits, and motor coordination problems. Because the underlying genetic cause of this disorder is known, study of NF1 from a molecular, cellular, and systems perspective has provided mechanistic insights into the etiology of higher-order cognitive symptoms associated with the disease. In particular, studies of animal models of NF1 indicated that disruption of Ras regulation of inhibitory networks is critical to the etiology of cognitive deficits associated with NF1.","conclusion":"Here, we review findings from NF1 animal models and human populations affected by NF1, highlighting areas of potential translation and discussing the implications and limitations of generalizing findings from this single-gene disease to idiopathic learning disabilities."},{"method":"Pathophysiological impairment or removal of SPns profoundly affects functional cortical development. SPn removal in visual cortex prevents the maturation of thalamocortical synapses, the maturation of inhibition in layer 4, the development of orientation selective responses and the formation of ocular dominance columns. SPn removal also alters ocular dominance plasticity during the critical period.","background":"The developing mammalian cerebral cortex contains a distinct class of cells, subplate neurons (SPns), that play an important role during early development. SPns are the first neurons to be generated in the cerebral cortex, they reside in the cortical white matter, and they are the first to mature physiologically. SPns receive thalamic and neuromodulatory inputs and project into the developing cortical plate, mostly to layer 4. Thus SPns form one of the first functional cortical circuits and are required to relay early oscillatory activity into the developing cortical plate.","conclusion":"Therefore, SPns are a key regulator of cortical development and plasticity. SPns are vulnerable to injury during prenatal stages and might provide a crucial link between brain injury in development and later cognitive malfunction."},{"method":"With the development of several new genetic labeling and imaging techniques, the study of synapse development and integration of these new neurons into mature circuits both in vitro and in vivo is rapidly advancing our insight into their structural plasticity.","background":"Although the lifelong addition of new neurons to the olfactory bulb and dentate gyrus of mammalian brains is by now an accepted fact, the function of adult-generated neurons still largely remains a mystery. The ability of new neurons to form synapses with preexisting neurons without disrupting circuit function is central to the hypothesized role of adult neurogenesis as a substrate for learning and memory.","conclusion":"Investigators' observation of synaptogenesis occurring in the adult brain is beginning to shed light on the flexibility that adult neurogenesis offers to mature circuits and the potential contribution of the transient plasticity that new neurons provide toward circuit refinement and adaptation to changing environmental demands."},{"method":"Recent advances in the means of marking neural circuits with optical or molecular reporters have revealed a clear-cut dichotomy between these two cell types at the molecular, anatomical, and physiological levels.","background":"The basal ganglia are a chain of subcortical nuclei that facilitate action selection. Two striatal projection systems--so-called direct and indirect pathways--form the functional backbone of the basal ganglia circuit. Twenty years ago, investigators proposed that the striatum's ability to use dopamine (DA) rise and fall to control action selection was due to the segregation of D(1) and D(2) DA receptors in direct- and indirect-pathway spiny projection neurons. Although this hypothesis sparked a debate, the evidence that has accumulated since then clearly supports this model.","conclusion":"The contrast provided by these studies has provided new insights into how the striatum responds to fluctuations in DA signaling and how diseases that alter this signaling change striatal function."},{"method":"Here I summarize the emerging results and propose a unifying model of how economic choice might function at the neural level.","background":"Traditionally the object of economic theory and experimental psychology, economic choice recently became a lively research focus in systems neuroscience.","conclusion":"Economic choice entails comparing options that vary on multiple dimensions. Hence, while choosing, individuals integrate different determinants into a subjective value; decisions are then made by comparing values. According to the good-based model, the values of different goods are computed independently of one another, which implies transitivity. Values are not learned as such, but rather computed at the time of choice. Most importantly, values are compared within the space of goods, independent of the sensorimotor contingencies of choice. Evidence from neurophysiology, imaging, and lesion studies indicates that abstract representations of value exist in the orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortices. The computation and comparison of values may thus take place within these regions."},{"method":"Zonal differences in afferent response dynamics may arise at multiple stages, including mechanoelectrical transduction, voltage-gated channels in hair cells and afferents, afferent transmission at calyceal and bouton synapses, and spike generation in regular and irregular afferents.","background":"Vestibular epithelia of the inner ear detect head motions over a wide range of amplitudes and frequencies. In mammals, afferent nerve fibers from central and peripheral zones of vestibular epithelia form distinct populations with different response dynamics and spike timing. Central-zone afferents are large, fast conduits for phasic signals encoded in irregular spike trains. The finer afferents from peripheral zones conduct more slowly and encode more tonic, linear signals in highly regular spike trains. The hair cells are also of two types, I and II, but the two types do not correspond directly to the two afferent populations.","conclusion":"In contrast, zonal differences in spike timing may depend more simply on the selective expression of low-voltage-activated ion channels by irregular afferents."},{"method":"Ventral lesions in right parietal, temporal, and frontal cortex that cause neglect directly impair nonspatial functions partly mediated by a ventral frontoparietal attention network. Structural damage in ventral cortex also induces physiological abnormalities of task-evoked activity and functional connectivity in a dorsal frontoparietal network that controls spatial attention.","background":"Unilateral spatial neglect is a common neurological syndrome following predominantly right hemisphere injuries and is characterized by both spatial and non-spatial deficits. Core spatial deficits involve mechanisms for saliency coding, spatial attention, and short-term memory and occur in conjunction with nonspatial deficits that involve reorienting, target detection, and arousal\/vigilance. We argue that neglect is better explained by the dysfunction of distributed cortical networks for the control of attention than by structural damage of specific brain regions.","conclusion":"The anatomy and right hemisphere dominance of neglect follow from the anatomy and laterality of the ventral regions that interact with the dorsal attention network."},{"method":"After SCI, different changes in cellular and circuit properties occur spontaneously and can be promoted by pharmacological, electrical, or rehabilitation strategies.","background":"After spinal cord injury (SCI), various sensorimotor functions can recover, ranging from simple spinal reflexes to more elaborate motor patterns, such as locomotion. Locomotor recovery after complete spinalization (complete SCI) must depend on the presence of spinal circuitry capable of generating the complex sequential activation of various leg muscles. This is achieved by an intrinsic spinal circuitry, termed the central pattern generator (CPG), working in conjunction with sensory feedback from the legs.","conclusion":"After partial SCI, hindlimb locomotor recovery can result from regeneration or sprouting of spared pathways, but also from mechanisms observed after complete SCI, namely changes within the intrinsic spinal circuitry and sensory inputs."},{"method":"Such neurons occur in CIP, AIP, TEs, and F5 (for first- or second-order disparity gradients), in MT\/V5, in FST (for speed gradients), and in CIP and TEs (for texture gradients). Most of these regions are activated during magnetic resonance scanning in alert monkeys by comparing 3D conditions with the 2D controls for the different cues. Similarities in activation patterns of monkeys and humans tested with identical paradigms suggest that like gradient-selective neurons are found in corresponding human cortical areas.","background":"Depth structure, the third dimension of object shape, is extracted from disparity, motion, texture, and shading in the optic array. Gradient-selective neurons play a key role in this process.","conclusion":"This view gains credence as the homologies between such areas become more evident. Furthermore, 3D shape-processing networks are similar in the two species, with the exception of the greater involvement of human posterior parietal cortex in the extraction of 3D shape from motion. Thus we can begin to understand how depth structure is extracted from motion, disparity, and texture in the primate brain, but the extraction of depth structure from shading and that of wire-like objects requires further scrutiny."},{"method":"Coordinate-based meta-analytic methods have emerged and evolved in rigor and utility. Early methods computed cross-study consensus, in a manner roughly comparable to traditional (nonimaging) meta-analysis. Recent advances now compute coactivation-based connectivity, connectivity-based functional parcellation, and complex network models powered from data sets representing tens of thousands of subjects.","background":"Spatial normalization--applying standardized coordinates as anatomical addresses within a reference space--was introduced to human neuroimaging research nearly 30 years ago. Over these three decades, an impressive series of methodological advances have adopted, extended, and popularized this standard.

Large-scale online databases have compiled these observations and their associated meta-data, stimulating the development of meta-analytic methods to exploit this expanding corpus.","conclusion":"Meta-analyses of human neuroimaging data in large-scale databases now stand at the forefront of computational neurobiology."},{"method":"The promise of such theoretically based markers is illustrated by recent findings that used a perturbational approach to assess the levels of consciousness.","background":"Significant advances have been made in the behavioral assessment and clinical management of disorders of consciousness (DOC). In addition, functional neuroimaging paradigms are now available to help assess consciousness levels in this challenging patient population. The success of these neuroimaging approaches as diagnostic markers is, however, intrinsically linked to understanding the relationships between consciousness and the brain. In this context, a combined theoretical approach to neuroimaging studies is needed.","conclusion":"Further research on the contents of consciousness in DOC is also needed."},{"method":"Its function may be regulated in the short term through the action of neurotransmitters, in the long term through activity- and Ca(2+)-dependent processes.","background":"The action potential generally begins in the axon initial segment (AIS), a principle confirmed by 60 years of research; however, the most recent advances have shown that a very rich biology underlies this simple observation. The AIS has a remarkably complex molecular composition, with a wide variety of ion channels and attendant mechanisms for channel localization, and may feature membrane domains each with distinct roles in excitation.","conclusion":"Thus, the AIS is not merely the beginning of the axon, but rather a key site in the control of neuronal excitability."},{"method":"We review models and experimental evidence for three systems in the rat brain that are presumed to be components of the rat's navigational and memory system.","background":"Attractor networks are a popular computational construct used to model different brain systems. These networks allow elegant computations that are thought to represent a number of aspects of brain function. Although there is good reason to believe that the brain displays attractor dynamics, it has proven difficult to test experimentally whether any particular attractor architecture resides in any particular brain circuit.","conclusion":"Head-direction cells have been modeled as a ring attractor, grid cells as a plane attractor, and place cells both as a plane attractor and as a point attractor. Whereas the models have proven to be extremely useful conceptual tools, the experimental evidence in their favor, although intriguing, is still mostly circumstantial."},{"method":"To explore this issue, this article reviews experiments that have used two powerful paradigms--stimulus-induced perceptual suppression and chronic V1 ablation--each of which disrupts the ability to perceive salient visual stimuli. Focus is placed on recent neurophysiological, behavioral, and functional imaging studies from the nonhuman primate that shed light on V1's role in conscious awareness. In addition, anatomical pathways that relay visual information to the cortex during normal vision and in blindsight are reviewed.","background":"The primary visual cortex (V1) is the principal telencephalic recipient of visual input in humans and monkeys. It is unique among cortical areas in that its destruction results in chronic blindness. However, certain patients with V1 damage, though lacking visual awareness, exhibit visually guided behavior: blindsight. This phenomenon, together with evidence from electrophysiological, neuroimaging, and psychophysical experiments, has led to speculation that V1 activity has a special or direct role in generating conscious perception.","conclusion":"Although the critical role of V1 in primate vision follows naturally from its position as a bottleneck of visual signals, little evidence supports its direct contribution to visual awareness."},{"method":"We review recent mathematical advances that provide ways to combat dimensionality in specific situations.","background":"The curse of dimensionality poses severe challenges to both technical and conceptual progress in neuroscience. In particular, it plagues our ability to acquire, process, and model high-dimensional data sets. Moreover, neural systems must cope with the challenge of processing data in high dimensions to learn and operate successfully within a complex world.","conclusion":"These advances shed light on two dual questions in neuroscience. First, how can we as neuroscientists rapidly acquire high-dimensional data from the brain and subsequently extract meaningful models from limited amounts of these data? And second, how do brains themselves process information in their intrinsically high-dimensional patterns of neural activity as well as learn meaningful, generalizable models of the external world from limited experience?"},{"method":"Identical isoforms on sister neurites exhibit isoform-specific homophilic recognition and elicit repulsion between processes, thereby promoting self-avoidance.","background":"Self-avoidance, the tendency of neurites of the same cell to selectively avoid each other, is a property of both vertebrate and invertebrate neurons. In Drosophila, self-avoidance is mediated by a large family of cell recognition molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily encoded, via alternative splicing, by the Dscam1 locus. Dscam1 promotes self-avoidance in dendrites, axons, and prospective postsynaptic elements. Expression analysis suggests that each neuron expresses a unique combination of isoforms.","conclusion":"Although any isoform can promote self-avoidance, thousands are necessary to ensure that neurites readily discriminate between self and nonself. Recent studies indicate that a large family of cadherins in the mouse, i.e., the clustered protocadherins, functions in an analogous fashion to promote self-avoidance.

The postsynaptic and presynaptic terminals are molecular systems with highly organized protein networks producing emergent physiological and behavioral properties. The major classes of synapse proteins and their respective functions in intercellular communication and adaptive responses evolved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes prior to the origins of neurons in metazoa. In eukaryotes, the organization of individual proteins into multiprotein complexes comprising scaffold proteins, receptors, and signaling enzymes formed the precursor to the core adaptive machinery of the metazoan postsynaptic terminal.","conclusion":"Natural selection has constrained diversification in mammalian postsynaptic mechanisms and the repertoire of adaptive and innate behaviors.

It is commonly addressed at two complementary levels of description and analysis: the cellular\/synaptic level (synaptic consolidation) and the brain systems level (systems consolidation).","conclusion":"Taken together, the picture that emerges is of dynamic engrams that are formed, modified, and remodified over time at the systems level by using synaptic consolidation mechanisms as subroutines. This implies that, contrary to interpretations that have dominated neuroscience for a while, but similar to long-standing cognitive concepts, consolidation of at least some items in long-term memory may never really come to an end."},{"method":"These tools have revealed features of the genetic architecture of adult cortical areas, layers, and cell types, as well as spatiotemporal patterning during development.","background":"The cerebral cortex is the source of our most complex cognitive capabilities and a vulnerable target of many neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.

Finally, transcriptomics is fueling progress in understanding the causes of neurodevelopmental diseases such as autism, linking genetic association studies to specific molecular pathways and affected brain regions."},{"method":"Regulation of spinal interneurons is used to switch between motor states such as locomotion (reciprocal innervation) and stance (coactivation pattern). Cortical regulation of presynaptic inhibition of sensory afferents may focus the central motor command by opening or closing sensory feedback pathways.","background":"Human studies in the past three decades have provided us with an emerging understanding of how cortical and spinal networks collaborate to ensure the vast repertoire of human behaviors. Humans have direct cortical connections to spinal motoneurons, which bypass spinal interneurons and exert a direct (willful) muscle control with the aid of a context-dependent integration of somatosensory and visual information at cortical level. However, spinal networks also play an important role. Sensory feedback through spinal circuitries is integrated with central motor commands and contributes importantly to the muscle activity underlying voluntary movements.","conclusion":"In the future, human studies of spinal motor control, in close collaboration with animal studies on the molecular biology of the spinal cord, will continue to document the neural basis for human behavior."},{"method":"Rodent models have also enabled unprecedented mechanistic insight into addiction, revealing plasticity of glutamatergic synaptic transmission evoked by the strong activation of mesolimbic dopamine-a defining feature of all addictive drugs-as a neural substrate for these drug-adaptive behaviors. Cell type-specific optogenetic manipulations have allowed both identification of the relevant circuits and design of protocols to reverse drug-evoked plasticity and to establish links of causality with drug-adaptive behaviors.","background":"Addiction is a disease of altered behavior. Addicts use drugs compulsively and will continue to do so despite negative consequences. Even after prolonged periods of abstinence, addicts are at risk of relapse, particularly when cues evoke memories that are associated with drug use. Rodent models mimic many of the core components of addiction, from the initial drug reinforcement to cue-associated relapse and continued drug intake despite negative consequences.","conclusion":"The emergence of a circuit model for addiction will open the door for novel therapies, such as deep brain stimulation."},{"method":"Transcriptomic and epigenetic differences are apparent between reproductive and sterile females, males and females, and workers that differ in body size.

Ant genomes are marked by extreme rates of gene turnover, especially in gene families related to olfactory communication, such as the synthesis of cuticular hydrocarbons and the perception of environmental semiochemicals.","conclusion":"Gene expression is associated with behavior including foraging, response to queens attempting to join a colony, circadian patterns of task performance, and age-related changes of task. Ant behavioral genetics needs further investigation of the feedback between individual-level physiological changes and socially mediated responses to environmental conditions."},{"method":"We provide a view from the bottom up, with a focus on single-unit responses and anatomy.","background":"The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has attracted great interest from neuroscientists because it is associated with so many important cognitive functions. Despite, or perhaps because of, its rich functional repertoire, we lack a single comprehensive view of its function. Most research has approached this puzzle from the top down, using aggregate measures such as neuroimaging.","conclusion":"We summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the three major approaches to characterizing the dACC: as a monitor, as a controller, and as an economic structure. We argue that neurons in the dACC are specialized for representing contexts, or task-state variables relevant for behavior, and strategies, or aspects of future plans. We propose that dACC neurons link contexts with strategies by integrating diverse task-relevant information to create a rich representation of task space and exert high-level and abstract control over decision and action."},{"method":"Converging evidence from cytoarchitectural and neuroimaging measurements underlies the definition of 11 AFMs across core and belt regions of human auditory cortex, with likely homology to those of macaque.

Each CFM comprises two orthogonal topographical representations, reflecting two essential aspects of sensory space. In auditory cortex, auditory field maps (AFMs) are defined by the combination of tonotopic gradients, representing the spectral aspects of sound (i.e., tones), with orthogonal periodotopic gradients, representing the temporal aspects of sound (i.e., period or temporal envelope).","conclusion":"Future research can now use these AFMs to investigate specific stages of auditory processing, key for understanding behaviors such as speech perception and multimodal sensory integration."},{"method":"The sex-specific neurons are well integrated within the remainder of the nervous system; in the male, 16% of the input to the shared component comes from male-specific neurons.","background":"The recently determined connectome of the Caenorhabditis elegans adult male, together with the known connectome of the hermaphrodite, opens up the possibility for a comprehensive description of sexual dimorphism in this species and the identification and study of the neural circuits underlying sexual behaviors.

Although neuron-intrinsic mechanisms are important in this process, it is increasingly recognized that glial cells also play a critical role. Without proper functioning of these cells, the number, morphology, and function of synaptic contacts are profoundly altered, resulting in abnormal connectivity and behavioral abnormalities. In addition to their role in synaptic refinement, glial cells have also been implicated in pathological synapse loss and dysfunction following injury or nervous system degeneration in adults.","conclusion":"Gaining a greater understanding of these signals and the contribution of different cell types will not only provide insight into this critical biological event but also be instrumental in advancing knowledge of brain development and neural disease."},{"method":"By interrogating magnocellular as well as parvocellular dopamine, GABA, glutamate, and phenotypically mixed neurons, we integrate available information at the molecular, cellular, network, and endocrine output levels to propose a framework for the comprehensive classification of hypothalamic neurons.","background":"Peripheral endocrine output relies on either direct or feed-forward multi-order command from the hypothalamus. Efficient coding of endocrine responses is made possible by the many neuronal cell types that coexist in intercalated hypothalamic nuclei and communicate through extensive synaptic connectivity.

We previously suggested that interneuron types should be defined by their role in cortical processing. Here, we revisit the question of how to codify their diversity based upon their division of labor and function as controllers of cortical information flow. We suggest that developmental trajectories provide a guide for appreciating interneuron diversity and argue that subtype identity is generated using a configurational (rather than combinatorial) code of transcription factors that produce attractor states in the underlying gene regulatory network.","conclusion":"We close by discussing findings indicating that major interneuron classes are both evolutionarily ancient and conserved. We propose that the complexity of cortical circuits is generated by phylogenetically old interneuron types, complemented by an evolutionary increase in principal neuron diversity.

A partial purification of American ginseng was performed to concentrate the putative protective components: Rb1, Rb3, and Rd (termed Rb extract). Pretreatment with the Rb extract significantly reduced the 3-nitropropionic acid-induced motor impairment and cell loss in the striatum, and it completely prevented any mortality.

Mice deficient in p55 receptor only showed reduced seizures; and both p75 and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 protein levels were upregulated in their hippocampi.

Lesion location was significantly more dorsal in patients with hemiparesis affecting more proximal muscles and was significantly more ventral in patients with predominantly distal limb paresis. Comparison of magnetic resonance lesion from patients with paresis predominantly affecting arm or leg did not show significant topographical differences.

Selective expression of Na(v)1.7 within dorsal root ganglion neurons including nociceptors (in which this channel is targeted to sensory terminals, close to impulse trigger zones) and within sympathetic ganglion neurons explains why patients experience pain but do not suffer from seizures or other manifestations of altered excitability within central nervous system neurons.","background":"In contrast with acquired pain syndromes, molecular substrates for hereditary pain disorders have been poorly understood. Familial erythromelalgia (Weir Mitchell's disease), also known as primary erythermalgia, is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by burning pain in the extremities in response to warm stimuli or moderate exercise. The cause of this disorder has been enigmatic, and treatment has been empirical and not very effective.","conclusion":"Erythromelalgia is the first human disorder in which it has been possible to associate an ion channel mutation with chronic neuropathic pain. Identification of mutations within a peripheral neuron-specific sodium channel suggests the possibility of rational therapies that target the affected channel. Moreover, because some other pain syndromes, including acquired disorders, involve altered sodium channel function, erythromelalgia may emerge as a model disease that holds more general lessons about the molecular neurobiology of chronic pain."},{"method":"Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a memory encoding task, we now show differential brain activation patterns among asymptomatic offspring which correspond to the previous linkage finding.","background":"Previously, we reported evidence of genetic heterogeneity in late-onset familial Alzheimer's disease, based on sex of affected parent, demonstrating linkage to chromosome 10q, a region identified by other groups and implicated as a quantitative trait loci for Abeta levels, in families with an affected mother.","conclusion":"These results suggest the possibility that activation patterns may prove useful as a preclinical quantitative trait related to the putative familial late-onset AD gene in this chromosome 10 region."},{"method":"We used a forewarned reaction time (contingent negative variation) task to test the effects of response preparation and sensory attention on N100 amplitude. Single-pulse TMS of motor cortex at 105% motor threshold intensity evoked N100 amplitudes of more than 100 microV in resting children (visible in single trials), which correlated negatively with age and positively with absolute stimulation intensity. During late contingent negative variation, which involves preactivation of the cortical structures necessary for a fast response, N100 amplitude was significantly reduced.","background":"The electroencephalographic response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) recently has been established as a direct parameter of motor cortex excitability. Its N100 component was suggested to reflect an inhibitory response. We investigated influences of cerebral maturation on TMS-evoked N100 in 6- to 10-year-old healthy children.","conclusion":"We conclude that (1) N100 amplitude reduction during late contingent negative variation provides further evidence that TMS-evoked N100 reflects inhibitory processes, (2) response preparation and attention modulate N100, and (3) TMS-evoked N100 undergoes maturational changes and could serve to test cortical integrity and inhibitory function in children. Parallels between the inhibitory N100 after TMS (provoking massive synchronous excitation) and the inhibitory wave component of epileptic spike wave complexes are suggested."},{"method":"The Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) is a prospective, observational study of 9,704 women aged 65 years and older recruited from four U.S. metropolitan areas.

During an average follow-up of 6.8 years, incident stroke occurred in 260 participants (3.1%) who had previously completed baseline cognitive testing. Among participants with stroke, 119 completed follow-up cognitive testing a median of 1.9 years after the stroke, 80 died before the next study visit, and 61 did not complete further cognitive testing.","background":"Hypertension has been associated with subclinical injury in the brain and may therefore increase the impact of an incident stroke on cognitive function.","conclusion":"After adjustment for demographic factors and other confounders, pre-existing hypertension was a strong predictor of cognitive decline when a stroke occurred (odds ratio [OR], 4.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37-12.1). In contrast, hypertension was only weakly associated with cognitive decline in the absence of stroke (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.04-1.22) (p for interaction = 0.032).

Our findings might be of relevance for many neurodegenerative disorders in which soluble protein aggregates are the main neurotoxic species."},{"method":"Using a novel approach to analyze the outermost nerves of the skin, we visualized for the first time the distinct microanatomical structure of the touch dome of human hairy skin. The dermal nerve fibers of this slowly adapting type 1 mechanoreceptor were embedded in dermal protrusions that could be readily discerned by Laminin-5 staining. Concerning the nerves supplying the touch domes, we found, unexpectedly, that besides Abeta-fibers, Adelta- and C-fibers also were regularly present. The epidermis overlying the nerve convolutes showed a distinctive architecture of the rete ridges clearly demarcated from the surroundings and extending over 0.193 +\/- 0.138 mm(2) (mean +\/- standard deviation).","background":"Receptor end organs and free-nerve endings in the skin are the peripheral sentinels of the sensorial nervous system encoding for touch, temperature, and pain.","conclusion":"Within this area, 756 +\/- 386 Merkel cells\/mm(2) (mean +\/- standard deviation) were present compared with less than 50\/mm(2) outside the touch dome, demonstrating for the first time a highly discontinuous distribution of these cells in nonglabrous skin.

Attention to the task and motor training kinematics were comparable across age groups and sessions.","background":"The ability of the central nervous system to form motor memories, a process contributing to motor learning and skill acquisition, decreases with age. Dopaminergic activity, one of the mechanisms implicated in memory formation, experiences a similar decline with aging. It is possible that restoring dopaminergic function in elderly adults could lead to improved formation of motor memories with training.","conclusion":"In young subjects, encoding a motor memory under placebo was more prominent than in older subjects, and the encoding process was accelerated by intake of levodopa. In the elderly group, diminished motor memory encoding under placebo was enhanced by intake of levodopa to levels present in younger subjects.

The risk for BI increased with tertiles of plasma ACE, without an interaction with hypertension. After adjustments, the association disappeared except among patients with cardioembolic BI and those without previous vascular events. Among the polymorphisms, there was a weak association of BI with angiotensin II type 1 receptor 1166C, a weak protective effect with angiotensinogen 174M, and a strong association of angiotensinogen 235T with 5-year vascular mortality.

Inhibition of complement activation therefore might be expected to limit the progression of the disease. Using in vitro and in vivo models of the Guillain-Barr&#xe9; syndrome variant, Miller Fisher syndrome, we have shown previously that anti-GQ1b ganglioside antibodies target the presynaptic motor nerve terminal axon and surrounding perisynaptic Schwann cells, thereby mediating destructive injury through deposition of membrane attack complex.","conclusion":"In these models, APT070 completely prevents membrane attack complex formation, and thereby has a major neuroprotective effect at the nerve terminal, as assessed by immunohistology of perisynaptic Schwann cell and axonal integrity.

Cultured neurons injured by oxygen-glucose deprivation were protected by combinations of interventions of xenon and hypothermia that, when administered alone, were not efficacious. A combination of xenon and hypothermia administered 4 hours after hypoxic-ischemic injury in neonatal rats provided synergistic neuroprotection assessed by morphological criteria, by hemispheric weight, and by functional neurological studies up to 30 days after the injury.","background":"Perinatal asphyxia can result in neuronal injury with long-term neurological and behavioral consequences. Although hypothermia may provide some modest benefit, the intervention itself can produce adverse consequences.","conclusion":"The protective mechanism of the combination, in both in vitro and in vivo models, involved an antiapoptotic action.

Unlike SMN1, SMN2 is primarily transcribed into truncated messenger RNA and produces low levels of SMN protein.","conclusion":"Hydroxyurea treatment resulted in a time-related and dose-dependent increase in the ratio of full-length to truncated SMN messenger RNA. SMN protein levels and intranuclear gems also were significantly increased in these hydroxyurea-treated cells. The SMN2 gene copy number correlated inversely with the SMA phenotypic severity.

However, translating successful animal studies into effective clinical therapy for Parkinson's disease has proved difficult.","conclusion":"Motor functions were significantly improved in rhesus monkeys with unilateral 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced parkinsonism that received midbrain infusion of GDNF for 10 weeks. The volume of distribution of GDNF in the five trophic factor recipients varied more than fivefold, from 59 to 325 mm3, and significantly correlated with motor function improvements. Significant increases were evident in the number of midbrain dopamine neurons immunopositive for tyrosine hydroxylase in both the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. Based on neurochemical and quantitative morphological measures, GDNF administration promoted recovery of both the nigrostriatal and ventral tegmental area-nucleus accumbens dopaminergic pathways without producing evident side effects. Increasing the dose threefold did not increase efficacy, suggesting that after achieving a critical threshold, GDNF tissue distribution is more important than dose for trophic stimulation of dopamine neurons."},{"method":"We report two unrelated patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency caused by defects in the E2 subunit.","background":"Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is a major cause of primary lactic acidosis and neurological dysfunction in infancy and early childhood. Most cases are caused by mutations in the X-linked gene for the E1alpha subunit of the complex. Mutations in DLAT, the gene encoding dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, the E2 core component of the complex, have not been described previously.","conclusion":"Both patients are less severely affected than typical patients with E1alpha mutations and both have survived well into childhood. Episodic dystonia was the major neurological manifestation, with other more common features of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, such as hypotonia and ataxia, being less prominent. The patients had neuroradiological evidence of discrete lesions restricted to the globus pallidus, and both are homozygous for different mutations in the DLAT gene.

The major alterations in sCJD brains included upregulation of the genes encoding immune and stress-response factors and elements involved in cell death and cell cycle, as well as prominent downregulation of genes encoding synaptic proteins. A comparison of the molecular subtypes of sCJD showed various expression patterns associated with particular subtypes. The range of the upregulated genes and the degree of the increased expression appeared to be correlated with the degree of the neuropathological alterations in particular subtypes.

Six of the latter patients were also examined for cognitive performance by means of a continuous performance test.","background":"The vestibular nerves are known to influence neuronal circuits in the medullary cardiovascular areas and, through the cerebellar vermis, the basal ganglia and the limbic system. By means of noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), it might be possible to ameliorate blunted responsiveness of degenerated neuronal circuits of patients with multi system atrophy or Parkinson's disease, or both.","conclusion":"Short-range or high-frequency fluctuations of heart rate were significantly increased by the noisy GVS compared with sham stimulation, suggestive of improved autonomic, especially parasympathetic, responsiveness. Long-range antipersistency of trunk activity patterns probed by an autocorrelation measure was significantly increased by the noisy GVS, suggestive of quickening of bradykinesic rest-to-active transitions. The mean reaction time of the continuous performance test was also significantly decreased by the noisy GVS, without significant changes in either the omission or commission error ratios, which is suggestive of improved motor execution during the cognitive task. In conclusion, the noisy GVS is effective in boosting the neurodegenerative brains of patients with multi system atrophy or Parkinson's disease, or both, including those unresponsive to standard levodopa therapy; it is also effective in improving these patients' autonomic and motor responsiveness."},{"method":"We studied three single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4(CTLA4) gene in thymoma patients, nonthymoma early-onset MG patients, and control subjects.","background":"Myasthenia gravis (MG) in thymoma patients depends critically on intratumorous generation and export of mature autoreactive CD4+ T cells. Why non-MG thymomas fail to produce CD4+ T cells is unknown.","conclusion":"Surprisingly, the CTLA4high genotype +49A\/A, which is protective against several autoimmune diseases, exerted a prominent predisposing effect to paraneoplastic MG in thymoma patients. The unusual disease association with a CTLA4high genotype implies a unique pathogenesis of paraneoplastic MG, with high CTLA4 levels possibly supporting the nontolerogenic selection of CD4+ T cells in MG-associated thymomas."},{"method":"In this study, we used standard patch-clamp electrophysiological techniques combined with histochemical approaches to study individual cells from human HH tissue immediately after surgical resection. More than 90% of dissociated HH cells were small (6-9 microm soma) and exhibited immunoreactivity to the neuronal marker NeuN, and to glutamic acid decarboxylase, but not to glial fibrillary acidic protein. Under current-clamp, whole-cell recordings in single dissociated cells or in intact HH slices demonstrated typical neuronal responses to depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current injection. In some cases, HH cells exhibited a \"sag-like\" membrane potential change during membrane hyperpolarization. Interestingly, most HH cells exhibited robust, spontaneous \"pacemaker-like\" action potential firing. Under voltage-clamp, dissociated HH cells exhibited functional tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive Na(+) and tetraethylammonium-sensitive K(+) currents.","background":"The hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) is a rare developmental malformation often characterized by gelastic seizures, which are usually refractory to medical therapy. The mechanisms of epileptogenesis operative in this subcortical lesion are unknown.","conclusion":"Both GABA and glutamate evoked whole-cell currents, with GABA exhibiting a peak current amplitude 10-fold greater than glutamate.

In normal subjects, anterior temporal activation was more extensive to the left than the right (laterality index [LI], +0.64; standard error [SE], 0.11). Laterality was inverted in PPA with word comprehension deficit (LI, - 0.34; SE, 0.19), with an intermediate pattern in PPA without comprehension deficit (LI, +0.23; SE, 0.14).

Significant differences between groups were observed at CSIs of 90% and 100% with an ISI of 3 milliseconds. Antiparkinsonian medication had no effect on SICI. These findings show that the low threshold inhibitory pathways mediating SICI are normal in PD.

It consists of four components (eye, motor, brainstem, and respiration), and each component has a maximal score of 4. We prospectively studied the FOUR score in 120 intensive care unit patients and compared it with the GCS score using neuroscience nurses, neurology residents, and neurointensivists.","background":"The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) has been widely adopted. Failure to assess the verbal score in intubated patients and the inability to test brainstem reflexes are shortcomings.","conclusion":"We found that the interrater reliability was excellent with the FOUR score (kappa(w) = 0.82) and good to excellent for physician rater pairs. The agreement among raters was similar with the GCS (kappa(w) = 0.82). Patients with the lowest GCS score could be further distinguished using the FOUR score. We conclude that the agreement among raters was good to excellent. The FOUR score provides greater neurological detail than the GCS, recognizes a locked-in syndrome, and is superior to the GCS due to the availability of brainstem reflexes, breathing patterns, and the ability to recognize different stages of herniation.

During migraine, CGRP is thought to be released from peripheral endings of perivascular meningeal nociceptors primary and to promote vasodilatation. A current hypothesis suggests that peripheral CGRP and its related meningeal vasodilatation results in activation and sensitization, leading to the generation of migraine headache. However, direct evidence supporting this idea is lacking.","conclusion":"Both topical and systemic administration of CGRP caused a significant increase in dural blood flow; however, neither method of CGRP administration resulted in activation or sensitization of meningeal nociceptors.

A significant increase in F(4)-NPs was present in parietal and occipital lobes in MCI compared to controls and a significant increase was present in these regions and hippocampus in late AD compared to controls. The only difference between MCI and late AD was significantly increased F(4)-NP in hippocampus in late AD.

However, the strong association between heterozygosity and PPA raises new questions about its cause and the role of PrP in other neurodegenerative diseases."},{"method":"To investigate whether spastin mutations are present in patients with primary lateral sclerosis and sporadic hereditary spastic paraparesis, we screened the spastin gene in 99 Dutch patients with an unexplained, apparently sporadic, adult-onset UMN syndrome.","background":"Mutation of the spastin gene is the single most common cause of pure hereditary spastic paraparesis. In patients with an unexplained sporadic upper motor neuron (UMN) syndrome, clinical distinction between primary lateral sclerosis and sporadic hereditary spastic paraparesis may be problematic.","conclusion":"We found 6 mutations, of which 4 were novel, in the subgroup of 47 patients with UMN symptoms restricted to the legs (13%). Another novel spastin mutation was found in a patient with a rapidly progressive spinal and bulbar UMN syndrome that progressed to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the patients with arm or bulbar UMN symptoms and slow progression, no spastin mutations were found. Our study shows that spastin mutations are a frequent cause of apparently sporadic spastic paraparesis but not of primary lateral sclerosis."},{"method":"We recruited 17 healthy subjects and 12 AD patients at an early stage of the disease. They underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning in four sessions. Each of the sessions combined a \"study\" phase and a \"test\" phase. Face\/name pairs were presented in each study phase, and subjects were asked to associate faces with names. In the test phase, a recognition task, faces seen in the study phase were presented each with four different names. The task required selection of appropriate previously associated names from the study phase. Responses were recorded for post hoc classification into those successfully or unsuccessfully encoded.","background":"We conducted an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment to better understand the potentially compensatory alternative brain networks activated by a clinically relevant face-name association task in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and matched control subjects.","conclusion":"There were significant differences between the groups in accuracy and reaction time. Comparison of correctly versus incorrectly encoded and recognized pairs in the two groups indicated bilateral hippocampal hypoactivation both when encoding and recognizing in the AD group. Moreover, patients showed bilateral hyperactivation of parts of the parietal and frontal lobes. We discuss whether hyperactivation of a frontoparietal network reflects compensatory strategies for failing associative memory in AD patients."},{"method":"Over 5 years, we managed healthy, nonobese subjects compliant with nasal CPAP. Only 47 subjects completed this prospective study, due to protocol requirements. They underwent regular clinical evaluation, subjective scales, four polysomnographies without nasal CPAP, recalibration of nasal CPAP with polysomnography, regular downloading of home data, and a palatal two-point discrimination study.","background":"Abnormal sensory responses have been found in the upper airway of obstructive sleep apnea patients, but no long-term study has been published previously regarding the evolution of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and persistence of abnormal pharyngeal sensory evaluation in response to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment.","conclusion":"None of the subjects presented normal results at any checkpoint when they had been without CPAP for two or three nights. By the completion of the study, all subjects required an increase in nasal CPAP (1-7 cm H(2)O) and demonstrated abnormal two-point palatal discrimination compared with control subjects. Despite initial control of clinical symptoms with regular usage of nasal CPAP in subjects without weight change, abnormal sensory palatal evaluation was present at the conclusion of the study. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome involves abnormal upper airway sensory input, which may be responsible for the development of apneas and hypopneas. These neurological lesions are persistent despite nasal CPAP treatment."},{"method":"We induced focal neocortical seizures with 4-aminopyridine in transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein in cortical neurons and sequentially imaged individual dendrites in living animals with two-photon laser-scanning microscopy to determine whether these seizures caused acute alterations in dendritic spine morphology.","background":"Epilepsy is associated with significant neurological morbidity, including learning disabilities, motor deficits, and behavioral problems. Although the causes of neurological dysfunction in epilepsy are multifactorial, accumulating evidence indicates that seizures in themselves may directly cause brain injury. Although it is clear that seizures can result in neuronal death, it is likely that under some circumstances seizures can induce more subtle functional or structural alterations in neurons.","conclusion":"No dendritic alterations were observed in anesthetized animals during electrographic seizures over a 3-hour period. Similarly, in unanesthetized mice, low-stage, clinical electrographic seizures had minimal effect on dendritic spines. More severe, high-stage seizures in unanesthetized mice were associated with a moderate loss of spines and dendritic swelling, but this effect may have been contingent on a synergistic action of phototoxicity from the imaging method itself. Overall, our results suggest that most neocortical seizures have minimal acute effects on dendrites over several hours, but may predispose to dendritic injury under extreme conditions."},{"method":"Cutting-edge technology in the form of telemedicine is being implemented in stroke care networks to combat the lack of stroke care expertise by extending the availability of physician stroke expertise. The telemedicine network can be used to transmit real-time data from stroke care-certified community hospitals (spokes) to a tertiary center (hub). Telemedicine can be used to educate physicians in spoke hospitals about new stroke treatments.","background":"Stroke is a major public health concern with few positive phase III clinical trials and a shortage of stroke care expertise. Drug development likely can be enhanced by adapting new outcome measures and following guidelines generated by consensus groups. To enhance rates of drug implementation and to improve stroke care, some states are requiring that acute care hospitals obtain primary stroke center certification, and this mandate necessitates that smaller hospitals join larger ones in stroke care networks.","conclusion":"The advent and development of telemedicine has the potential to ensure that patients with stroke have a greater opportunity to receive the full range of therapeutic options currently available and those that will become available in the future. The implementation of future drug therapies through telemedicine-organized stroke networks will likely substantially influence the future of acute stroke therapy."},{"method":"In one Italian nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy family, we identified two new putative loci on chromosomes 3 and 8, where several candidate genes are mapped. In particular, on chromosome 8, corticotropin-releasing hormone gene (CRH) appears to be a good candidate. We therefore searched for CRH mutations in the proband.","background":"Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy up to now has been considered a channelopathy caused by mutations in the alpha(4) and beta(2) subunits of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. However, these mutations account for only a minority of patients, and the existence of at least a new locus for the disease has been demonstrated.","conclusion":"The study allowed the identification of a nucleotide variation in the promoter that was subsequently detected in all affected and obligate carrier members of the same family, in two sporadic cases, in all affected members of an additional compliant family, and in the proband of a noncompliant family.

Molecular analysis of the DJ-1 gene in two living patients showed a novel homozygous mutation in exon 7 (E163K) and a new homozygous mutation (g.168_185dup) in the promoter region of the gene. Both mutations cosegregated with the disease and were detected in a heterozygous state in the patients' mother and their healthy siblings.","background":"DJ-1 gene mutations have been found to cause early-onset Parkinson's disease.","conclusion":"Our findings expand the spectrum of clinical presentations associated with mutations in DJ-1 gene."},{"method":"Here, we addressed these challenges by first constructing a spatiotemporal model, predicting a priori how a molecule underlying AD should behave anatomically and over time. Then, guided by the model, we generated gene expression profiles of the entorhinal cortex and the dentate gyrus, harvested from the brains of AD cases and controls covering a broad age span.","background":"Although, in principle, gene expression profiling is well suited to isolate pathogenic molecules associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), techniques such as microarray present unique analytic challenges when applied to disorders of the brain.","conclusion":"Among many expression differences, the retromer trafficking molecule VPS35 best conformed to the spatiotemporal model of AD. Western blotting confirmed the abnormality, establishing that VPS35 levels are reduced in brain regions selectively vulnerable to AD. VPS35 is the core molecule of the retromer trafficking complex and further analysis revealed that VPS26, another member of the complex, is also downregulated in AD. Cell culture studies, using small interfering RNAs or expression vectors, showed that VPS35 regulates Abeta peptide levels, establishing the relevance of the retromer complex to AD. Reviewing our findings in the context of recent studies suggests how downregulation of the retromer complex in AD can regulate local levels of Abeta peptide."},{"method":"We investigated a newly identified familial frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism family. The disease was of early onset and was inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Clinically, parkinsonism was the prominent and often early feature, and it preceded dementia. Three autopsied cases shared involvement predominantly in the frontal and temporal lobes and also in the subcortical nuclei, including substantia nigra, globus pallidus, and subthalamic nucleus, that microscopically consisted of neuronal loss, microvacuolation, and astrocytic fibrosis. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated neuropil threads, ballooned cells, and glial fibrillary tangles. Sequencing analysis of the MAPT gene showed an alteration in one allele, resulting in a P301S substitution.","background":"Mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) cause frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17. Clinical variability is seen not only among families with different mutations, but also among family members with the same mutation.","conclusion":"These findings suggest that the MAPT P301S mutation can cause pathologically subcortical-predominant, neuropil thread-rich, tau-containing lesions, which could result in consistent parkinsonism. Our study confirms the notion that the phenotype observed in affected individuals from P301S MAPT mutation families is heterogeneous and is broader than the phenotypes seen to date in affected family members carrying other MAPT mutations."},{"method":"Here, we describe the clinical and genetic characterization of a new LHON mtDNA mutation.","background":"Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) causes central vision loss from bilateral optic neuropathy.

One unique therapy that improves recovery after stroke is neutralization of the neurite inhibitory protein Nogo-A.","conclusion":"These results support the efficacy of Nogo-A neutralization as treatment for ischemic stroke, even in the aged animal and after a 1-week delay, and implicate neuronal plasticity from unlesioned areas of the central nervous system as a mechanism for recovery."},{"method":"We reviewed the cardiac pathology of patients who died during SE to asses for contraction bands.

Eleven p-HD subjects (age, 45.8 +\/- 11.0 years; CAG repeat length, 41.6 +\/- 1.8) and 11 age-matched control subjects (age, 45.3 +\/- 13.4 years) underwent H(2) (15)O positron emission tomography while performing a set of kinematically controlled motor sequence learning and execution tasks. Differences in regional brain activation responses between groups and conditions were assessed. In addition, we identified discrete regions in which learning-related activity correlated with performance.","background":"Motor sequence learning is abnormal in presymptomatic Huntington's disease (p-HD). The neural substrates underlying this early manifestation of HD are poorly understood.","conclusion":"We found that sequence learning was impaired in p-HD subjects despite normal motor performance. In p-HD, activation responses during learning were abnormally increased in the left mediodorsal thalamus and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; BA 11\/47). Impaired learning performance in these subjects was associated with increased activation responses in the precuneus (BA 18\/31). These data suggest that enhanced activation of thalamocortical pathways during motor learning can compensate for caudate degeneration in p-HD. Nonetheless, this mechanism may not be sufficient to sustain a normal level of task performance, even during the presymptomatic stage of the disease."},{"method":"We conducted a population-based case-control study of all newly diagnosed unprovoked seizures among Icelandic children and adults aged 10 years and older to test the hypothesis that major depression is a risk factor for developing unprovoked seizure and epilepsy, and to address whether specific symptoms of depression account for this increased risk. Cases were matched to the next two same sex births from the population registry. Using standardized interviews, we ascertained symptoms of major depression to make a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis.","background":"Major depression has been shown to increase the risk for development of epilepsy, but prior studies have not evaluated whether this is due to specific symptoms of depression.","conclusion":"A history of major depression was 1.7-fold more common among cases than among controls (95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.7). A history of attempted suicide was 5.1-fold more common among cases than among controls (95% confidence interval, 2.2-11.5). Attempted suicide increased seizure risk even after adjusting for age, sex, cumulative alcohol intake, and major depression or number of symptoms of depression. Major depression and attempted suicide independently increase the risk for unprovoked seizure. These data suggest that depression and suicide attempt may be due to different underlying neurochemical pathways, each of which is important in the development of epilepsy."},{"method":"We examined the expression and function of the GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) in SSADH-deficient mice. A selective decrease in binding of [(35)S]tert-butylbicyclophosphorothionate was observed in SSADH(-\/-) mice at postnatal day 7 that was progressive until the third postnatal week of life when, at the nadir of the decreased [(35)S]tert-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding, generalized convulsive seizures emerged that rapidly evolved into status epilepticus. We also observed a substantial downregulation of the beta(2) subunit of GABA(A)R, a reduction in GABA(A)-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, and augmented postsynaptic population spikes recorded from hippocampal slices.","background":"The epilepsy that occurs in SSADH deficiency has a seizure phenotype similar to that occurring in the SSADH(-\/-) mouse.","conclusion":"The SSADH(-\/-) mouse model represents a powerful investigative tool for understanding the pathophysiology of the seizures associated with human SSADH deficiency. These data raise the possibility that progressive dysfunction of the GABA(A)R may be involved in the development of seizures in SSDAH-deficient mice.

This study investigated whether dopamine contributed to the associative long-term potentiation-like effect in the M1 in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.","conclusion":"The motor-evoked potential amplitude in the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle was increased by IPAS in healthy volunteers, but not in PD patients. IPAS did not affect the motor-evoked potential amplitude in the left abductor pollicis brevis. The ratio of the motor-evoked potential amplitude before and after IPAS in PD-off patients increased after dopamine replacement. Thus, dopamine might modulate cortical plasticity in the human M1, which could be related to higher order motor control, including motor learning."},{"method":"In three patients, immunosuppression resulted in resolution of RBD in parallel with remission of the limbic syndrome. RBD persisted in two patients with partial resolution of the limbic syndrome.","background":"Of six patients registered in our center with nonparaneoplastic limbic encephalitis associated with antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels, the five men had rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) coincident with voltage-gated potassium channel antibody-associated limbic encephalitis onset.","conclusion":"Our findings suggest that RBD is frequent in the setting of voltage-gated potassium channel antibody-associated limbic encephalitis and can be related to autoimmune-mediated mechanisms.

This lack of association in the Yoruba might reflect genetic variation, environmental factors, as well as genetic\/environmental interactions."},{"method":"Bromodeoxyuridine labeling, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry were used to identify proliferating progenitors and mature DGCs in the adult rat pilocarpine temporal lobe epilepsy model. We also examined dentate gyri from epileptic human hippocampal surgical specimens. Prox-1 immunohistochemistry and pulse-chase bromodeoxyuridine labeling showed that progenitors migrate aberrantly to the hilus and molecular layer after prolonged seizures and differentiate into ectopic DGCs in rat. Neuroblast marker expression indicated the delayed appearance of chainlike progenitor cell formations extending into the hilus and molecular layer, suggesting that seizures alter migratory behavior of DGC precursors.","background":"Neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus persists throughout life and is increased by seizures. The dentate granule cell (DGC) layer is often abnormal in human and experimental temporal lobe epilepsy, with dispersion of the layer and the appearance of ectopic granule neurons in the hilus. We tested the hypothesis that these abnormalities result from aberrant DGC neurogenesis after seizure-induced injury.","conclusion":"Ectopic putative DGCs also were found in the hilus and molecular layer of epileptic human dentate gyrus. These findings indicate that seizure-induced abnormalities of neuroblast migration lead to abnormal integration of newborn DGCs in the epileptic adult hippocampus, and implicate aberrant neurogenesis in the development or progression of recurrent seizures."},{"method":"Here, we show that guanfacine, a noradrenergic agonist that modulates dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, improves leftward space exploration in selected right-hemisphere patients with neglect.","background":"Visual neglect after stroke is often associated with a failure to explore contralesional space.","conclusion":"The positive effects of guanfacine were associated with extended ability to maintain attention on task. The results suggest that neuropharmacological targeting of intact frontal areas might be one way to enhance cognitive function after damage to posterior brain regions in selected individuals."},{"method":"Moreover, mutations in LRRK2 known to cause parkinsonism are associated not only with dopaminergic neuronal degeneration, but also with the accumulation of synuclein, tau, neither, or both proteins. Other shared genetic features between tauopathies and synucleinopathies also exist. Finally, the known protein interactions between tau and synuclein further highlight the interface.","background":"Neurodegenerative diseases are often classified based on the abnormal accumulation of synuclein or tau. Traditionally, these disorders have been viewed as distinct clinical and pathological entities. However, advances in molecular genetics and protein biochemistry have shown intriguing overlaps. The most common synucleinopathy, Parkinson's disease, is characterized by extrapyramidal motor dysfunction, whereas the most common tauopathy, Alzheimer's disease, is defined by dementia. Yet there is overlap of clinical features; Parkinson's disease patients frequently have dementia, and Alzheimer's disease patients often manifest parkinsonism. Dementia with Lewy bodies exemplifies the existence of a continuum among these diseases. This overlap extends to the neuropathological findings; the pathognomonic hallmark for one set of disorders, Lewy bodies or neurofibrillary tangles, is present more often than expected in the other set.","conclusion":"Evidence for the intersection of tauopathies and synucleinopathies indicates the need for an updated disease classification scheme and may have important implications for therapeutic development."},{"method":"Stroke induces a unique microenvironment for axonal sprouting in periinfarct cortex, in which growth-inhibitory molecules are reduced for 1 month after the infarct. During this period, neurons activate growth-promoting genes in successive waves. Neurogenesis also occurs through waves of migration of immature neurons from their origin in the subventricular zone into periinfarct cortex. This migration is mediated, in part, by the cytokine erythropoietin.","background":"Stroke is associated with a limited degree of functional recovery. Imaging studies in humans have shown that reorganization in periinfarct and connected cortical areas most closely correlates with functional recovery after stroke. On a cellular level, two major regenerative events occur in periinfarct cortex: axons sprout new connections and establish novel projection patterns, and newly born immature neurons migrate into periinfarct cortex.","conclusion":"These data indicate that the cellular environment after stroke is far from one of just death and destruction, but rather involves a longer evolving process of neuronal regeneration. Poststroke neuronal regeneration is characterized by waves of specific cellular and molecular events.

These dramatic events drew PML squarely into the spotlight and generated considerable interest from the medical community, the pharmaceutical industry, financial markets, and regulatory agencies alike. This scrutiny, in turn, helped crystallize areas of consensus and expose gaps in our understanding of PML pathogenesis. Indeed, since its initial description, there has been a considerable evolution in both the epidemiology and clinical presentations of this disease, and new manifestations of central nervous system infection by polyomavirus JC have been characterized.","conclusion":"Hopefully, this crisis will be instrumental in helping us define novel avenues of research, develop predictive tests for PML in populations at risk, and challenge us to find a treatment for this deadly disease."},{"method":"We administered a synthetic, specific UPS inhibitor (PSI) subcutaneously to rats and quantified substantia nigral tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic neurons by stereology.","background":"Dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasomal system (UPS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.

Whereas these so-called adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporters prevent the brain entry of toxic compounds under physiological conditions, they complicate pharmacotherapies in neurological disease. Recent observations in animal models of ischemic stroke, drug-resistant epilepsy, and brain cancer showed that the prototype of ABC transporters, ABCB1, is upregulated on brain injury, deactivation of this carrier considerably enhancing the accumulation of neuroprotective, antiepileptic, and chemotherapeutic compounds.","conclusion":"Under clinical conditions, efforts currently are made to enhance drug accumulation by selecting new compounds that do not bind to efflux carriers or deactivating ABC transporters by targeted downregulation or pharmacological inhibition. We predict that strategies aiming at circumventing drug efflux may greatly facilitate progress in neurological therapies."},{"method":"During the first 30 months, 30 cases of suspected prion disease were referred from throughout Washington. Of these, 18 cases had prion disease, and all of these were classified as either familial or sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD); there was no case of variant CJD.","background":"In February 2004, we initiated an epidemiological investigation within a US state to enhance autopsy surveillance for clinically suspected prion disease.","conclusion":"This represents a death rate of approximately 1.1 cases of sporadic CJD per 1 million people per year in Washington.

Acute administration of zolpidem markedly improved motor performance and neuropsychological status. Cerebral metabolism ((18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) increased in postrolandic territories and in frontal cortex.

The positive results from the first Stroke-Acute-Ischaemic-NXY-Treatment (SAINT-I) trial of the free-radical spin-trap drug, NXY-059, which followed many of the STAIR guidelines, reinvigorated enthusiasm in neuroprotection, but the SAINT-II trial did not replicate the positive effect on the same primary prespecified outcome measure.","background":"The concept of neuroprotective therapy for acute ischemic stroke to salvage tissue at risk and improve functional outcome is based on sound scientific principles and extensive preclinical animal studies demonstrating efficacy. The failure of most neuroprotective drugs in clinical trials has been due to inadequate preclinical testing and flawed clinical development programs.","conclusion":"This has led to concerns about the future of neuroprotection as a therapeutic strategy for acute ischemic stroke. We discuss new suggestions to bridge the chasm between preclinical animal modeling and acute human stroke trials to potentially enhance the future assessment of novel neuroprotective drugs."},{"method":"In a population-based cohort study among 5,279 participants aged 55 years or older with graded retinal vessel diameters, we observed that greater serum levels of C-reactive protein and fibrinogen and greater lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) activity were strongly associated with larger venular diameters.","background":"Retinal vessels may provide a way to study the cerebral microcirculation. In particular, larger retinal venular diameters have been associated with cerebrovascular disease. An inflammatory response may underlie this association.","conclusion":"Weaker associations were found with arteriolar diameters. Our findings support the hypothesis that larger retinal venular diameters reflect systemic inflammation and suggest that inflammation is involved in cerebrovascular disease."},{"method":"We used optical intrinsic signal imaging and electrophysiological techniques to investigate CSD in C57Bl\/6 mice.

Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is thought to be a fundamental mechanism of migraine, and CSD in rodents is used as a model for migraine.","conclusion":"we found that female mice had a significantly reduced threshold for induction of CSD compared with male mice. These results suggest an increased cortical excitability in female mice that may be independent of the estrous cycle."},{"method":"We identified three SCA17 families with expansion of uninterrupted alleles, thus greatly increasing the number of known intergenerational transmissions of such alleles.","background":"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is caused by expansion of a CAG\/CAA repeat in the TBP gene. Most pathogenic alleles are interrupted and are stably transmitted from parent to offspring without anticipation.","conclusion":"We found that uninterrupted SCA17 alleles are unstable, associated with anticipation, and show a paternal expansion bias that increases with age. Even small increments in repeat length resulted in inordinate increases in anticipation. Anticipation was also associated with childhood presentation. Sequencing of all SCA17 alleles is required for effective genetic counseling."},{"method":"We examined -1021C--&gt;T in a sample of 1,244 PD patients and 1,186 unrelated control subjects.","background":"DBH is a candidate gene in Parkinson's disease (PD) and contains a putative functional polymorphism (-1021C--&gt;T) that has been reported to modify PD susceptibility.","conclusion":"There was no significant difference in allele (p = 0.14) or genotype (p = 0.26) frequencies between the two groups.

Of the 351 manuscripts entered into the trial, 88 were randomized to traditional external review and 263 to early screening.","background":"Peer review is a cornerstone of scientific publication. However, it is time consuming for reviewers and contributors, and must be balanced with editorial oversight for balance and bias.","conclusion":"Rates of final acceptance were similar in the two groups (p = 0.41). Final decisions were more delayed for traditional review (mean 48 days versus 18 days with early screening; p &lt; 0.0001) and more reviewers were required for each manuscript (mean 2.3 versus 0.7 with early screening; p &lt; 0.0001). Among accepted manuscripts, reviewer ratings of scientific and clinical impact were similar. We conclude that a method of early screening of manuscripts for appropriateness for publication results in substantial decreases in the time between manuscript submission and publication decisions, and reduces the burden on reviewers with minimal impact on the quality of accepted manuscripts. Editorial screening is now journal policy."},{"method":"By using functional magnetic resonance imaging in a patient with alien hand syndrome after right parietal lesion, we could identify brain regions activated during involuntary or voluntary actions with the affected left hand.","background":"Alien hand syndrome is a rare neurological disorder in which movements are performed without conscious will.","conclusion":"Alien hand movements involved a selective activation of contralateral primary motor cortex (M1), presumably released from conscious control by intentional planning systems.

Some degree of spontaneous behavioral recovery is usually seen in the weeks after stroke onset. Variability in recovery is substantial across human patients. Some principles have emerged; for example, recovery occurs slowest in those destined to have less successful outcomes.","conclusion":"In general, the best outcomes are associated with the greatest return toward the normal state of brain functional organization. Reorganization of surviving central nervous system elements supports behavioral recovery, for example, through changes in interhemispheric lateralization, activity of association cortices linked to injured zones, and organization of cortical representational maps. A number of factors influence events supporting stroke recovery, such as demographics, behavioral experience, and perhaps genetics. Such measures gain importance when viewed as covariates in therapeutic trials of restorative agents that target stroke recovery."},{"method":"We screened total-blood progranulin (PGRN) levels in 107 patients with neurodegenerative dementias and related conditions, and 36 control subjects, and report the following findings:","background":"Peripheral blood is a readily available tissue source allowing relatively noninvasive screening for a host of medical conditions.","conclusion":"(1) confirmation of high progranulin expression levels in peripheral blood; (2) two subjects with reduced progranulin levels and mutations in the PGRN gene confirmed by direct sequencing; and (3) greater PGRN messenger RNA levels in patients with clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

Normal human gait is characterized by prominent up-and-down linear head movements (vertical translations).","conclusion":"Compared with healthy subjects, all cerebellar patients showed impaired otolith-ocular responses. Neurologists often test the rotational vestibuloocular reflexes in cerebellar patients, but our results indicate that vestibular responses to vertical linear motion are severely affected. Impairment of the corresponding otolith-spinal reflexes may contribute substantially to falls."},{"method":"Examples include small molecules, growth factors, cell-based therapies, electromagnetic stimulation, device-based strategies, and task-oriented and repetitive training-based interventions. Stage of development across therapies varies widely, from preclinical to late-phase clinical trials. The optimal methods to prescribe such therapies require further studies, for example, to best identify appropriate patients or to guide features of dosing. Likely, anatomic, functional, and behavioral measures of brain state, as well as measures of injury, will each be useful in this regard.","background":"Spontaneous behavioral recovery is usually limited after stroke, making stroke a leading source of disability. A number of therapies in development aim to improve patient outcomes not by acutely salvaging threatened tissue, but instead by promoting repair and restoration of function in the subacute or chronic phase after stroke.","conclusion":"Considerations for clinical trials of restorative therapies are provided, emphasizing both similarities and points of divergence with acute stroke clinical trial design."},{"method":"To reexamine the relation between IOP and ICP, we reviewed the medical records of all patients who underwent lumbar puncture between 1991 and 2007 in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic at the University of California San Francisco.

This effort emphasized available bedside tools that do not require neuropsychological expertise to administer or interpret. This work recently has been completed, and two primary articles have been published.","background":"Cognitive impairment is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and involves attentional, executive, visuospatial, and memory dysfunctions. Dementia is more frequently encountered in PD than in age-matched control populations, and whereas operational definitions of Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies have been developed, Parkinson's disease dementia (PD-D) has remained undefined. The Movement Disorder Society developed a task force to define and develop diagnostic guidelines for PD-D. This effort was based on existing descriptive studies with special emphasis on drawing distinction among Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and PD-related cognitive impairment without dementia whenever possible.","conclusion":"The suggested clinical diagnostic criteria for PD-D involve four domains and are anchored in core features, associated clinical features, features that make the diagnosis uncertain, and features that are not compatible with the diagnosis of PD-D. When all four criteria are satisfactorily met, probable PD-D is designated; when the first and last criteria are met, but clinical characteristics are atypical or uncertainty factors exist, possible PD-D is designated.

The inclusion criteria can be applied internationally and in multicenter research on treatment interventions, clinicopathological correlations, and studies of cognitive and other nonmotor elements of PD."},{"method":"The selection of which drug to begin must be tailored to the patient's individual characteristics and circumstances. Monoamine oxidase B inhibitors result in a mild improvement in motor function compared to dopamine agonists or levodopa.

Dopamine agonists lead to a substantial improvement in motor function and are, or will shortly be, available as once a day drugs. They are generally well tolerated but can be associated with exacerbating confusion or hallucinations and with behavioral changes. Levodopa is the most potent of the dopaminergic drugs.

Secondly, there is evidence to support the notion that earlier rather than later initiation of treatment leads to better long term motor benefit.","conclusion":"The most important limiting factor for the use of levodopa is the emergence of motor complications.

Stem cell and progenitor cell biology provide new opportunities for selection and development of large batches of specific therapeutic cells. This may allow for cell composition analysis and dosing to optimize the benefit to an individual patient. The biotechnology used for cell and gene therapy for treatment of neurological disease may eventually be as advanced as today's pharmaceutical drug-related design processes. Current gene therapy phase 1 safety trials for PD include the delivery of a growth factor (neurturin via the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor) and a transmitter enzyme (glutamic acid decarboxylase and aromatic acid decarboxylase).

In the setting of chronic pain, however, their long-term utility is limited by the development of tolerance and physical dependence. Drug companies have tried to overcome these problems by simply \"dialing up\" signal transduction at the receptor, designing more potent and efficacious agonists and more long-lasting formulations. Neither of these strategies has proven to be successful, however, because the net amount of signal transduction, particularly over extended periods of drug use, is a product of much more than the pharmacokinetic properties of potency, efficacy, half-life, and bioavailability, the mainstays of traditional pharmaceutical screening. Both the quantity and quality of signal transduction are influenced by many regulated processes, including receptor desensitization, trafficking, and oligomerization. Importantly, the efficiency with which an agonist first stimulates signal transduction is not necessarily related to the efficiency with which it stimulates these other processes.","conclusion":"We also discuss preliminary evidence that heteromers of the delta opioid receptor and the MOR are pronociceptive, and that drugs that spare such heteromers may also induce reduced tolerance."},{"method":"37 patients clinically diagnosed with iNPH participated in a prospective study in which performance on neurologic, psychometric, and gait measures before and 4 months after shunting was correlated with amyloid &#x3b2; plaques, neuritic plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles observed in cortical biopsies obtained during shunt insertion.

In inflammatory demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), the degeneration and eventual loss of functional myelin sheaths slows and blocks saltatory conduction in axons, which results in clinical impairment. However, remyelination can occur, and lesions can be partially repaired, resulting in clinical remission. The recruitment and activation of resident oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) play a critical role in the repair process because these cells have the capacity to differentiate into functional myelinating cells. Mature oligodendrocytes, however, are thought to have lost the capacity to develop new myelin sheaths and frequently undergo programmed cell death in MS. The endogenous capacity to generate new oligodendrocytes in MS is limited, and this is predominantly due to the presence of inhibitory components that block OPC differentiation and maturation.","conclusion":"Because currently available immunomodulatory drugs for MS mainly target inflammatory cascades outside the brain and fail to repair existing lesions, achieving more efficient lesion repair constitutes an important goal for future MS therapies."},{"method":"Decades ago the structural and mechanistic basis of the cellular degeneration in HIE was thought to be necrosis.

In several subregions of the PPC, these operations are facilitated by the use of a common distributed space representation that is independent of both sensory input and motor output. Attention and learning effects are also evident in the PPC.","background":"The posterior parietal cortex (PPC), historically believed to be a sensory structure, is now viewed as an area important for sensory-motor integration. Among its functions is the forming of intentions, that is, high-level cognitive plans for movement. There is a map of intentions within the PPC, with different subregions dedicated to the planning of eye movements, reaching movements, and grasping movements.","conclusion":"However, these effects may be general to cortex and operate in the PPC in the context of sensory-motor transformations."},{"method":"Soon after migrating to the cortical plate, neurons extend an apical dendrite directed toward the pial surface. The oriented growth of the apical dendrite is regulated by Sema3A, which acts as a dendritic chemoattractant. Subsequent dendritic development involves signaling by neurotrophic factors and Notch, which regulate dendritic growth and branching. During postnatal development the formation and stabilization of dendritic spines are regulated in part by patterns of synaptic activity.","background":"Dendritic morphology has a profound impact on neuronal information processing. The overall extent and orientation of dendrites determines the kinds of input a neuron receives. Fine dendritic appendages called spines act as subcellular compartments devoted to processing synaptic information, and the dendritic branching pattern determines the efficacy with which synaptic information is transmitted to the soma. The acquisition of a mature dendritic morphology depends on the coordinated action of a number of different extracellular factors. Here we discuss this evidence in the context of dendritic development in the cerebral cortex.","conclusion":"These observations suggest that extracellular signals play an important role in regulating every aspect of dendritic development and thereby exert a critical influence on cortical connectivity."},{"method":"In rats and monkeys, localized brain lesion and pharmacological approaches have been used to examine the role of the basal ganglia in S-R learning.

Extensive evidence now indicates a role for the basal ganglia, in particular the dorsal striatum, in learning and memory. One prominent hypothesis is that this brain region mediates a form of learning in which stimulus-response (S-R) associations or habits are incrementally acquired. Support for this hypothesis is provided by numerous neurobehavioral studies in different mammalian species, including rats, monkeys, and humans.","conclusion":"Several of these studies have dissociated the role of the basal ganglia in S-R learning from those of a cognitive or declarative medial temporal lobe memory system that includes the hippocampus as a primary component. Evidence suggests that during learning, basal ganglia and medial temporal lobe memory systems are activated simultaneously and that in some learning situations competitive interference exists between these two systems."},{"method":"Single afferent responses are modulated by all the relevant stimulus parameters. Thus, only in complete population reconstructions is it clear how each of the parameters can be signaled to the brain independently when many are changing simultaneously, as occurs in most normal movements or haptic exploration.","background":"For humans to manipulate an object successfully, the motor control system must have accurate information about parameters such as the shape of the stimulus, its position of contact on the skin, and the magnitude and direction of contact force. The same information is required for perception during haptic exploration of an object.

Attention produces qualitatively different effects on firing rate, depending on whether a stimulus appears alone or accompanied by distracters. Studies of contrast gain control in anesthetized mammals have found parallel patterns of results when the luminance contrast of a stimulus increases. This finding suggests that attention has co-opted the circuits that mediate contrast gain control and that it operates by increasing the effective contrast of the attended stimulus.","conclusion":"Studies in the slice have begun to explain how modulatory signals might cause such increases in sensitivity."},{"method":"In the cortex, information from the three retino-geniculate channels is combined to enable perception of a large variety of different hues.","background":"Color vision starts with the absorption of light in the retinal cone photoreceptors, which transduce electromagnetic energy into electrical voltages. These voltages are transformed into action potentials by a complicated network of cells in the retina. The information is sent to the visual cortex via the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in three separate color-opponent channels that have been characterized psychophysically, physiologically, and computationally. The properties of cells in the retina and LGN account for a surprisingly large body of psychophysical literature. This suggests that several fundamental computations involved in color perception occur at early levels of processing.","conclusion":"Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that color analysis and coding cannot be separated from the analysis and coding of other visual attributes such as form and motion. Though there are some brain areas that are more sensitive to color than others, color vision emerges through the combined activity of neurons in many different areas."},{"method":"Selectivity for space is broad and ambiguous in low-order neurons. Parallel pathways for binaural cues and for different frequency bands converge on high-order space-specific neurons, which encode space more precisely.

Consequently it would make sense for the brain to form an explicit representation of object-centered and not just of ego-centered space. Evidence bearing on the presence and nature of neural maps of object-centered space has come from two sources: single-neuron recording in behaving monkeys and assessment of the visual abilities of human patients with hemispatial neglect.","conclusion":"These patients neglect one side of an object, as defined relative to its intrinsic midline, regardless of its location and orientation relative to the viewer. The two sets of observations are complementary in the sense that the loss of neurons, such as observed in the monkey, could explain the spatial distribution of neglect in these patients."},{"method":"These studies encompass the polyglutamine diseases, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and tau-associated pathologies.","background":"A number of approaches have been taken to recreate and to study the role of genes associated with human neurodegenerative diseases in the model organism Drosophila.","conclusion":"The findings highlight Drosophila as an important model system in which to study the fundamental pathways influenced by these genes and have led to new insights into aspects of pathogenesis and modifier mechanisms."},{"method":"In recent studies, several trans-synaptic signaling systems have been identified that can mediate various aspects of synaptic differentiation in the central nervous system.","background":"Synapses join individual nerve cells into a functional network. Specific cell-cell signaling events regulate synapse formation during development and thereby generate a highly reproducible connectivity pattern. The accuracy of this process is fundamental for normal brain function, and aberrant connectivity leads to nervous system disorders.

Recently, genetic approaches have been used to clarify the role of heredity in the development of anxiety and to probe its neurobiological underpinnings. Twin studies have shown that a significant proportion of the liability to develop any given anxiety disorder is due to genetic factors. Ongoing efforts to map anxiety-related loci in both animals and humans are underway with limited success to date. Animal models have played a large role in furthering our understanding of the genetic basis of anxiety, demonstrating that the genetic factors underlying anxiety are complex and varied.","conclusion":"With this increasing specificity has come the ability to ask and answer precise questions about the mechanisms of anxiety and its treatment."},{"method":"We argue that cortical maps reflect neuronal connectivity in intracortical circuits. Because connecting distant neurons requires costly wiring (i.e., axons and dendrites), there is an evolutionary pressure to place connected neurons as close to each other as possible.","background":"In mammalian visual cortex, neurons are organized according to their functional properties into multiple maps such as retinotopic, ocular dominance, orientation preference, direction of motion, and others. What determines the organization of cortical maps?","conclusion":"Then, cortical maps may be viewed as solutions that minimize wiring cost for given intracortical connectivity.

The model that has influenced much of the work in the field for the past 30 years suggests that motor learning is mediated by a single plasticity mechanism in the cerebellum: long-term depression (LTD) of parallel fiber synapses onto Purkinje cells. However, recent studies of simple behaviors such as the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) indicate that multiple plasticity mechanisms contribute to cerebellum-dependent learning. Multiple plasticity mechanisms may provide the flexibility required to store memories over different timescales, regulate the dynamics of movement, and allow bidirectional changes in movement amplitude. These plasticity mechanisms must act in combination with appropriate information-coding strategies to equip motor-learning systems with the ability to express learning in correct contexts.","conclusion":"These principles emerging from studies of the VOR are consistent with results concerning more complex behaviors and thus may reflect general principles of cerebellar function."},{"method":"Modern genetics has now identified mutations in one gene [Cu\/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1)] as a primary cause and implicated others [encoding neurofilaments, cytoplasmic dynein and its processivity factor dynactin, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)] as contributors to, or causes of, motor neuron diseases.

LC neurons exhibit two modes of activity, phasic and tonic. Phasic LC activation is driven by the outcome of task-related decision processes and is proposed to facilitate ensuing behaviors and to help optimize task performance (exploitation). When utility in the task wanes, LC neurons exhibit a tonic activity mode, associated with disengagement from the current task and a search for alternative behaviors (exploration).

One way to examine possible perturbations of cortical organization in autism is to analyze the activation of category-selective ventral visual cortex, already clearly delineated in typical populations.","conclusion":"There were no consistent group differences in place-related regions. Although there were no significant differences in the extent of the object-related regions, there was more variability for these regions in the autism group. The most marked group differences were in face-selective cortex, with individuals with autism evincing reduced activation, not only in fusiform face area but also in superior temporal sulcus and occipital face area. Ventral visual cortex appears to be organized differently in high-functioning adults with autism, at least for face-selective regions, although subtle differences may also exist for other categories. We propose that cascading developmental effects of low-level differences in neuronal connectivity result in a much more pronounced effect on later developing cortical systems, such as that for face-processing, than earlier maturing systems (those for objects and places)."},{"method":"This study used the Rey Osterreith Complex Figure (ROCF) task and an objective scoring system to examine local\/global processing approaches to its reproduction in 37 individuals diagnosed with high-functioning autism (HFA) compared to 49 age-, IQ-, and gender-matched typically developing controls (TD). The sample was divided into children (aged 8-14 years) and adolescents\/adults (aged 15-47 years) to assess age effects.","background":"Individuals with autism have an atypical pattern of visual processing. Various studies have provided evidence that individuals with autism perceive the details of stimuli before the gestalt, the reverse of the typical pattern of visual processing.","conclusion":"Results showed no difference in overall performance on the ROCF between HFA and TD children. TD participants displayed improved organizational and planning skills with age and a shift to global processing approaches, but there were no differences in performance between children and adolescents\/adults with HFA. There was no evidence of enhanced local processing in either HFA group. These findings suggest that HFA individuals with average IQ scores do not have the clinically demonstrable evidence of the enhanced local processing thought to reflect increased local brain connectivity in more severely autistic individuals. The deficient global processing of the HFA adults reflects dependence of performance on impaired strategic problem-solving abilities, which has been demonstrated to result from under development of neural connectivity between visuo-spatial and frontal brain regions in HFA adults."},{"method":"Descriptions were elicited in a referential communication task where shared information was manipulated, and in a guessing game where clues had to be provided about the identity of an object that was hidden from the addressee. Across these tasks, increasingly complex levels of audience design were assessed: (1) the ability to give adequate descriptions from one's own perspective, (2) the ability to adjust descriptions to an addressee's perspective when this differs from one's own, and (3) the ability to provide indirect yet identifying descriptions in a situation where explicit labeling is inappropriate.","background":"This study compared the object descriptions of school-age children with high-functioning autism (HFA) with those of a matched group of typically developing children.","conclusion":"Results showed that there were group differences in all three cases, with the HFA group giving less efficient descriptions with respect to the relevant context than the comparison group. More revealing was the identification of distinct adaptation profiles among the HFA participants: those who had difficulty with all three levels, those who displayed Level 1 audience design but poor Level 2 and Level 3 design, and those demonstrated all three levels of audience design, like the majority of the comparison group. Higher structural language ability, rather than symptom severity or social skills, differentiated those HFA participants with typical adaptation profiles from those who displayed deficient audience design, consistent with previous reports of language use in autism."},{"method":"Children with ASD and co-morbid ADHD symptoms (ASD+ADHD; n = 21), children with ASD without ADHD (ASD; n = 28), and a typically developing control group (n = 21) were included in the study; all groups were matched on age, gender-ratio, IQ, and socioeconomic status.

Presence of ADHD symptoms in the context of ASD could have a variety of effects on cognition, autistic traits, and adaptive\/maladaptive behaviors including: exacerbating core ASD impairments; adding unique impairments specific to ADHD; producing new problems unreported in ASD or ADHD; having no clear impact; or producing some combination of these scenarios.","conclusion":"In this sample, the presence of ADHD symptoms in ASD exacerbated impairments in EC and adaptive behavior and resulted in higher autistic trait, and externalizing behavior ratings. ADHD symptoms were also associated with greater impairments on a lab measure of verbal working memory. These findings suggest that children with ASD+ADHD symptoms present with exacerbated impairments in some but not all domains of functioning relative to children with ASD, most notably in adaptive behavior and working memory.

Five of the seven variants in the ASD group were predicted to affect protein function, alter residues conserved across 18 species, or both. All of the variants for which parental DNA was available were inherited.

The amyloid precursor protein-binding protein A2 (APBA2) gene is located within the 15q13.1 duplication and encodes a neuronal adaptor protein essential to synaptic transmission that interacts directly with NRXN1 at the presynaptic membrane. We interpreted this as evidence for a putative role of APBA2 in autism as larger maternal duplications of 15q11-q13 are the most common known cause of autism.","conclusion":"These results indicate compound heterozygous mutations of APBA2 in this autism sibship.

Although progress has been made in the measurement of the OCB associated with ASD, more work is needed including the potential identification of heritable endophenotypes.

Some of the vulnerability genes may prove to be generalist genes influencing the phenotypic expression of both ASD and OCD while others will be specific to subcomponents of the ASD phenotype.

The G allele of rs301979 was undertransmitted (equivalent to overtransmission of the C allele under a dominant model) to individuals with autism (Z=-2.47, P=0.01).

Using the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) data set, Zhao et al. identified 86 high-risk families with likely dominant transmission.

While possible downstream effects of this hypothesis such as altered face and voice processing have been examined, there has not been a direct investigation of social reward processing in autism.","conclusion":"We found diminished neural responses to both social and monetary rewards in ASD, with a pronounced reduction in response to social rewards (SR). Children with ASD also demonstrated a further deficit in frontostriatal response during social, but not monetary, rewarded learning. Moreover, we show a relationship between ventral striatum activity and social reciprocity in TD children. Together, these data support the hypothesis that children with ASD have diminished neural responses to SR, and that this deficit relates to social learning impairments."},{"method":"We used psychophysics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate responses to somatosensory stimulation with three textured surfaces that spanned a range of roughness and pleasantness in a sample of adults with ASD and a control group. While psychophysical ratings of roughness and pleasantness were largely similar across the two groups, the ASD group gave pleasant and unpleasant textures more extreme average ratings than did controls. In addition, their ratings for a neutral texture were more variable than controls, indicating they are less consistent in evaluating a stimulus that is affectively ambiguous. Changes in brain blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in response to stimulation with these textures differed substantially between the groups, with the ASD group exhibiting diminished responses compared to the control group, particularly for pleasant and neutral textures. For the most unpleasant texture, the ASD group exhibited greater BOLD response than controls in affective somatosensory processing areas such as the posterior cingulate cortex and the insula. The amplitude of response in the insula in response to the unpleasant texture was positively correlated with social impairment as measured by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R).","background":"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with differences in sensory sensitivity and affective response to sensory stimuli, the neural basis of which is still largely unknown.","conclusion":"These results suggest that people with ASD tend to show diminished response to pleasant and neutral stimuli, and exaggerated limbic responses to unpleasant stimuli, which may contribute to diminished social reward associated with touch, perpetuating social withdrawal, and aberrant social development."},{"method":"Eye tracking and visual event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in 35 infants (20 average-risk typical infants, 15 high-risk siblings of children with ASD) while they viewed photographs of a smiling unfamiliar female face.

However, increased attention to the mouth was associated with weaker receptive communication skills and increased attention to the eyes correlated with better interpersonal skills. ERP results revealed that all infants detected eye and mouth changes but did so using different brain mechanisms. Changes in facial features were associated with changes in activity of the face perception mechanisms (N290) for the average-risk group but not for the high-risk infants. For all infants, correlations between ERP and eye-tracking measures indicated that larger and faster ERPs to feature changes were associated with fewer fixations on the irrelevant regions of stimuli.

Nonetheless for all sulcal pieces, the mean geodesic depth was not significantly different between the two groups. Our results suggest that sulcal surface and length can have correlation with morphological changes of cortex in ASD. Greater surface area and length in insula and IPS, respectively, may reflect greater folding.

Given the extensive evidence suggesting ASDs are characterized by abnormal neural connectivity, this study aimed to investigate network connectivity during visuospatial processing in ASD.","conclusion":"Behavioral results revealed a relative advantage of mental rotation in the ASD group-controls were slower responding to the more difficult Mirror Trials than Same Trials whereas the ASD group completed Mirror Trials and Same-trials at similar speeds. In the ASD group, brain activity was reduced in frontal, temporal, occipital, striatal, and cerebellar regions and, consistent with previous literature, functional connectivity between a number of brain regions was reduced. However, some connections appeared to be conserved and were recruited in a qualitatively different way by the two groups. As task difficulty increased (on Mirror Trials), controls tended to increase connections between certain brain regions, whereas the ASD group appeared to suppress connections between these regions. There was an interesting exception to this pattern in the visual cortex, a finding that may suggest an advantage in early visual perceptual processing in ASD. Overall, this study has identified a relative advantage in mental rotation in ASD that is associated with aberrant neural connectivity and that may stem from enhanced visual perceptual processing."},{"method":"The present study compared affordance perception in adolescents and adults with ASDs to typically developing (TD) controls.

Identifying putative underlying mechanisms of these impairments could lead to improved understanding of the etiology of core social\/communicative deficits in ASDs, and identification of novel intervention targets. The ability to perceptually integrate one's physical capacities with one's environment (affordance perception) may be such a mechanism. This ability has been theorized to be impaired in ASDs, but this question has never been directly tested. Crucially, affordance perception has shown to be amenable to learning; thus, if it is implicated in deficits in ASDs, it may be a valuable unexplored intervention target.","conclusion":"Compared with controls, individuals with ASDs showed unprecedented gross impairments in relating information about their bodies' action capabilities to visual information specifying the environment. The magnitude of these deficits strongly predicted the magnitude of social\/communicative impairments in individuals with ASDs. Thus, social\/communicative impairments in ASDs may derive, at least in part, from deficits in basic perceptual-motor processes (e.g. action capability estimation). Such deficits may impair the ability to maintain and calibrate the relationship between oneself and one's social and physical environments, and present fruitful, novel, and unexplored target for intervention."},{"method":"This study tested the ability to discriminate gender from facial features, namely eyes and mouths, by comparing accuracy scores of 17 children with autism and 15 adults with autism to 17 typically developing children and 15 typically developing adults.","background":"Evidence remains mixed about whether individuals with autism look less to eyes and whether they look more at mouths.

Parents did not differ from control subjects on any measures. No significant differences in Cho or mI levels were seen among groups. No reliable correlations between autism symptom measures, and MRS variables were seen after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The elevation in Glx in autism is consistent with prior MRS data in the hippocampus and frontal lobe and may suggest increased cortical excitability. Increased NAA and Cr may indicate brain metabolism disturbances in autism. In the current study, we found no reliable evidence of a familial effect for any spectroscopy measure.

One explanation is that unlike bodily oriented actions, object-directed actions have tangible, functional outcomes and hence rely far less on social motivations for their production.","conclusion":"Our findings were surprising. The HFA children copied all of a modeling adult's actions, including those that had no function or purpose (i.e. they overimitated), and they entered into extended bouts repeating an arbitrary action along with the adult who had a similar object to play with (i.e. they engaged in synchronic imitation). Moreover, they did so at rates indistinguishable from the TD children. This work demonstrates that the capacity and propensity for overimitation and synchronic imitation are intact in children with HFA, and questions whether socially based imitation should be considered an autism-specific deficit."},{"method":"Within the MECP2 duplication group, we further delineated aspects of the behavioral phenotype and also examined how duplication size and gene content corresponded to clinical severity.

Direct comparisons of ASD profiles revealed that a majority of boys with MECP2 duplication syndrome are similar to idiopathic ASD; they have impairments in social affect (albeit to a lesser degree than idiopathic ASD) and similar severity in restricted\/repetitive behaviors. Nonverbal mental age did not correlate with severity of social impairment or repetitive behaviors. Within the MECP2 duplication group, breakpoint size does not predict differences in clinical severity.

Atypical Heschl's gyrus white matter volumetric growth was found bilaterally in the autism individuals with a history of delayed onset of spoken language.

We measured the spatial distribution of performance accuracies and reaction times to quantify the sizes and locations of the attention field, with and without spatial uncertainty (i.e. the lack of predictability concerning the spatial position of the upcoming stimulus).","background":"Rapid manipulation of the attention field (i.e. the location and spread of visual spatial attention) is a critical aspect of human cognition, and previous research on spatial attention in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has produced inconsistent results.","conclusion":"We found that high-functioning adults with autism exhibited slower reaction times overall with spatial uncertainty, but the effects of attention on performance accuracies and reaction times were indistinguishable between individuals with autism and typically developing individuals in all three experiments. These results provide evidence of intact endogenous spatial attention function in high-functioning adults with ASD, suggesting that atypical endogenous attention cannot be a latent characteristic of autism in general."},{"method":"The aim of the current study was to explore the reason for this by measuring eye movements.","background":"It is widely accepted that we use contextual information to guide our gaze when searching for an object. People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) also utilise contextual information in this way; yet, their visual search in tasks of this kind is much slower compared with people without ASD.","conclusion":"Eye movement analyses revealed that the slowing of visual search was not caused by making a greater number of fixations. Instead, participants in the ASD group were slower to launch their first saccade, and the duration of their fixations was longer. These results indicate that slowed search in ASD in contextual learning tasks is not due to differences in the spatial allocation of attention but due to temporal delays in the initial-reflexive orienting of attention and subsequent-focused attention. These results have broader implications for understanding the unusual attention profile of individuals with ASD and how their attention may be shaped by learning."},{"method":"To explore a possible role in autism etiology, we used data available from our prior studies to examine potential occupational exposures, as these may occur at higher levels than environmental exposures. Parental occupation was obtained from birth certificates for 284 children with autism and 659 controls, born in 1994 in the San Francisco Bay Area. Self-reported occupation and industry were coded into eight exposure\/chemical groups based on potential neurotoxicity or reprotoxicity by a board-certified physician in occupational medicine and an industrial hygienist blinded to case-control status.","background":"The continuing rise in the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders has led to heightened interest in the role of nongenetic factors, including exogenous exposures, but little research has been conducted.","conclusion":"Mothers of autistic children were twice as likely to work in occupations considered exposed (14.4%) as mothers of controls (7.2%) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.3 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.3-4.2]). The exposure categories of the greatest frequency among case mothers were exhaust and combustion products (AOR = 12.0 [95% CI 1.4-104.6]) and disinfectants (AOR = 4.0 [95% CI 1.4-12.0]). Paternal occupational exposure was not associated with autism, potentially consistent with a direct in-utero exposure effect. There are several limitations of this hypothesis-generating study, including lack of detail on workplace and job duties, leading to possible misclassification and low proportion exposed. However, this misclassification would not be biased by case-control status and is unlikely to explain the associations we did find, suggesting that further research on exogenous exposures may yield useful etiologic clues."},{"method":"D1 and D2 of the dominant hand of the participant were individually stimulated while we recorded neural responses using magnetoencephalography. The cortical representations of D1 and D2 (somatosensory-evoked fields) were computed from the ensemble-averaged data using (a) dipole model fits and (b) singular value decomposition. Individual adjacent\/primary response ratios were measured, and group response ratio data were fitted with straight lines. Local overconnectivity in autism implies steeper ASD vs. NT group slopes.","background":"Emerging evidence for differences between individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and neurotypical (NT) individuals in somatic processing and brain response to touch suggests somatosensory cortex as a promising substrate for elucidating differences in functional brain connectivity between individuals with and without autism. Signals from adjacent digits project to neighboring locations or representations in somatosensory cortex. When a digit is stimulated, i.e. touched, its representation in cortex is directly activated; local intracortical connections indirectly activate nonprimary cortical representations corresponding to adjacent digits. The response of the nonprimary cortical representations is thus a proxy for connection strength. Local overconnectivity in autism implies that the nonprimary\/primary response ratios of the ASD group will be higher than those of the NT group.","conclusion":"Our findings did not support local overconnectivity. Slopes were found to be significantly shallower for the ASD group than the NT group. Our findings support the idea of local underconnectivity in the somatosensory cortex of the brains of individuals with ASD."},{"method":"Infant siblings were recruited from families with at least one older child with ASD (high-risk group, n = 104) or families with no history of ASD (low-risk group, n = 76). As part of a longitudinal prospective study, children completed the Mullen Scales of Early Learning and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, and parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Social Communication Questionnaire at 36 months of age. This study focuses on developmental concerns outside of ASD; therefore, only siblings who did not develop an ASD were included in analyses.","background":"The present study explores behavioral and sleep outcomes in preschool-age siblings of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This study focuses on behavior problems that are common in children with ASD, such as emotional reactivity, anxiety, inattention, aggression, and sleep problems.","conclusion":"Negative binomial regression analyses revealed that children in the high-risk group were more likely to have elevated behavior problems on the CBCL Anxious\/Depressed and Aggression subscales. To explore sleep problems as a correlate of these behavior problems, a second series of models was specified. For both groups of children, sleep problems were associated with elevated behavior problems in each of the areas assessed (reactivity, anxiety, somatic complaints, withdrawal, attention, and aggression). These findings support close monitoring of children with a family history of ASD for both behavioral and sleep issues."},{"method":"Data were available at 9 months, 3 years, and 5 years old for 132 children with ASD, identified from a population-representative sample of UK children.

Specifically, findings suggested that while early behavior problems are not a risk factor for later maternal well-being, maternal psychological distress, physical health limitations, and lower life satisfaction are risk factors for later child behavior problems."},{"method":"We used wild-type C57BL\/6 (B6) mice as \"judges\" and evaluated their preference for a chamber containing a \"typical\" (B6 or 129S6) or an \"atypical\" mouse. For our atypical mouse stimuli, we chose two inbred strains with well-documented social phenotypes (BTBR and BALB\/c), as well a mutant line with abnormal social behavior and seizures (Gabrb3 +\/-).","background":"Diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) requires a qualitative assessment of social aptitude: one person judging whether another person interacts in a \"typical\" way. We hypothesized that mice could be used to make a similar judgment if they prefer \"typical\" over \"atypical\" social interactions with mouse models relevant to ASD.","conclusion":"Overall, we observed a stimulus by time interaction (P &lt; 0.0001), with B6 mice preferring the typical mouse chamber during the last 10 min of the 30-min test. For two of the individual stimulus pairings, we observed a similar chamber by time interaction (BALB\/c vs. 129S6, P = 0.0007; Gabrb3 +\/- vs. 129S6, P = 0.033). For the third stimulus pairing, we found a trend for preference of the typical mouse across time (BTBR vs. B6, P = 0.051). We repeated the experiments using 129S6 mice as judges and found a significant overall interaction (P = 0.034), but only one stimulus pairing reached significance on its own (BALB\/c vs. 129S6, P = 0.0021). These data suggest that a characteristic pattern of exploration in B6 mice can distinguish some socially atypical animals from controls."},{"method":"Thirty-seven cognitively able children with an autism spectrum condition were assessed on tests tapping verbal and nonverbal ability, theory of mind (false-belief prediction), executive function (planning ability, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control), and central coherence (local processing) at intake and their behavioral functioning (social communication, repetitive behaviors and interests, insistence on sameness) 3 years later.","background":"This follow-up study investigated the predictive power of early cognitive atypicalities. Specifically, it examined whether early individual differences in specific cognitive skills, including theory of mind, executive function, and central coherence, could uniquely account for variation in autistic children's behaviors-social communication, repetitive behaviors, and interests and insistence on sameness-at follow-up.","conclusion":"Individual differences in early executive but not theory of mind skills predicted variation in children's social communication. Individual differences in children's early executive function also predicted the degree of repetitive behaviors and interests at follow-up. There were no predictive relationships between early central coherence and children's insistence on sameness. These findings challenge the notion that distinct cognitive atypicalities map on to specific behavioral features of autism. Instead, early variation in executive function plays a key role in helping to shape autistic children's emerging behaviors, including their social communication and repetitive behaviors and interests."},{"method":"We investigated whether maternal exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEP) negatively affects fetal development leading to autism-like phenotype in mice. Female mice and their offspring were exposed to DEP during pregnancy and nursing. Adult male offspring were then tested for behaviors reflecting the typical symptoms of ASD patients.","background":"Abundant evidence indicates that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, limited knowledge is available concerning these contributing factors. An epidemiology study reported a link between increased incidence of autism and living closely to major highways, suggesting a possible role for pollutants from highway traffic.","conclusion":"Compared to control mice, DEP-exposed offspring exhibited higher locomotor activity, elevated levels of self-grooming in the presence of an unfamiliar mouse, and increased rearing behaviors, which may be relevant to the restricted and repetitive behaviors seen in ASD patients. However, the DEP-exposed mice did not exhibit deficits in social interactions or social communication which are the key features of ASD. These results suggest that early life exposure to DEP could have an impact on mouse development leading to observable changes in animal behaviors. Further studies are needed to reveal other environmental insults and genetic factors that would lead to animal models expressing key phenotypes of the autism spectrum disorders."},{"method":"The present study partially replicates prior work by examining the fear-potentiated startle response in adolescents with ASD, and extends this to investigate the relationship between startle response and anxiety. Eyeblink magnitude and latency (electromyographic activity; EMG) were collected from 20 adolescents with ASD and 19 typically developing (TD) age-matched adolescents during a fear-potentiated startle paradigm. Parent-report and self-report of anxiety and additional psychiatric symptoms were collected.","background":"It has been suggested that atypical amygdala function contributes to the social impairments characteristic of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Previous research has demonstrated that adolescents and adults with ASD generate normal response during a fear-potentiated startle paradigm, suggesting this aspect of amygdala function is intact and may not account for the social dysfunction associated with the condition. The amygdala also plays a crucial role in the expression of anxiety and may contribute to high rates of reported anxiety in individuals with ASD.","conclusion":"Parental reports indicated higher rates of associated psychopathology in adolescents with ASD compared with TD adolescents. Consistent with previous results, both groups showed normal potentiated startle response, and no group differences in EMG were found. Symptoms of anxiety and level of social impairment were unrelated to startle response. These findings held for all levels of anxiety, suggesting that within the context of the fear-potentiated startle paradigm, amygdala response is not associated with degree of atypical social or emotional functioning in ASD."},{"method":"CSD-based tractography avoids a number of critical confounds that are associated with diffusion tensor tractography, and to our knowledge, this is the first time that this advanced diffusion tractography method has been used in autism research. Twenty-five participants with ASD and aged 25, intelligence quotient-matched controls completed a high angular resolution diffusion imaging scan. The inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) and arcuate fasciculus were isolated using CSD-based tractography. Quantitative diffusion measures of white matter microstructural organization were compared between groups and associated with visuospatial processing performance.","background":"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are associated with a marked disturbance of neural functional connectivity, which may arise from disrupted organization of white matter. The aim of this study was to use constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)-based tractography to isolate and characterize major intrahemispheric white matter tracts that are important in visuospatial processing.","conclusion":"Significant alteration of white matter organization was present in the right IFOF in individuals with ASD. In addition, poorer visuospatial processing was associated in individuals with ASD with disrupted white matter in the right IFOF. Using a novel, advanced tractography method to isolate major intrahemispheric white matter tracts in autism, this research has demonstrated that there are significant alterations in the microstructural organization of white matter in the right IFOF in ASD. This alteration was associated with poorer visuospatial processing performance in the ASD group. This study provides an insight into structural brain abnormalities that may influence atypical visuospatial processing in autism."},{"method":"Functional imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging) was used to examine brain activation and cortical synchronization during the processing of literal and ironic texts in 15 children with autism, 14 children with typical development, 13 adults with autism, and 12 adult controls.","background":"Comparison of brain function between children and adults with autism provides an understanding of the effects of the disorder and associated maturational differences on language processing.","conclusion":"Both the children and adults with autism had lower functional connectivity (synchronization of brain activity among activated areas) than their age and ability comparison group in the left hemisphere language network during irony processing, and neither autism group had an increase in functional connectivity in response to increased task demands. Activation differences for the literal and irony conditions occurred in key language-processing regions (left middle temporal, left pars triangularis, left pars opercularis, left medial frontal, and right middle temporal). The children and adults with autism differed from each other in the use of some brain regions during the irony task, with the adults with autism having activation levels similar to those of the control groups. Overall, the children and adults with autism differed from the adult and child controls in (a) the degree of network coordination, (b) the distribution of the workload among member nodes, and (3) the dynamic recruitment of regions in response to text content. Moreover, the differences between the two autism age groups may be indicative of positive changes in the neural function related to language processing associated with maturation and\/or educational experience."},{"method":"In the current study, high-functioning children and adolescents with an ASD and age- and IQ-matched typically developing controls were shown a series of pictures of faces in a study phase. These pictures were of individuals whose gaze was either directed straight ahead or whose gaze was averted to one side. We tested the memory for these study faces in a recognition task in which the faces were shown with their eyes closed.","background":"We tested the hypothesis that the direction of gaze of target faces may play a role in reported face recognition deficits in those with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In previous studies, typically developing children and adults better remembered faces in which the eyes were gazing directly at them compared with faces in which the eyes were averted.","conclusion":"The typically developing group better remembered the direct-gaze faces, whereas the ASD participants did not show this effect. These results imply that there may be an important link between gaze direction and face recognition abilities in ASD."},{"method":"In the current study, the colour of drinks either provided congruent, incongruent or ambiguous (colourless) information about the flavour. Participants identified the flavours of 12 drinks from a list and completed a measure of autistic traits, the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ).","background":"We assessed whether autistic traits are related to the ability to identify flavour. In general, the colour of the food or drink facilitates identification of its flavour.","conclusion":"In line with previous studies, flavour identification was impaired in incongruent conditions, while identification in congruent conditions was not improved when compared with that in ambiguous conditions. AQ scores were related to flavour identification in incongruent conditions, in that as the AQ score increased, accuracy of flavour identification decreased. There were no relationships found in the congruent or ambiguous conditions. This finding is in line with the idea that conflicting sensory information may be more disruptive for individuals on the autism spectrum."},{"method":"Here, we employed genome-wide expression analysis to compare the transcriptome of stem cells of human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs) of idiopathic autistic patients (n = 7) and control samples (n = 6).","background":"Identification of the causes of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is hampered by their genetic heterogeneity; however, the different genetic alterations leading to ASD seem to be implicated in the disturbance of common molecular pathways or biological processes. In this scenario, the search for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between ASD patients and controls is a good alternative to identify the molecular etiology of such disorders.","conclusion":"Nearly half of the 683 identified DEGs are expressed in the brain (P = 0.003), and a significant number of them are involved in mechanisms previously associated with ASD such as protein synthesis, cytoskeleton regulation, cellular adhesion and alternative splicing, which validate the use of SHEDs to disentangle the causes of autism. Autistic patients also presented overexpression of genes regulated by androgen receptor (AR), and AR itself, which in turn interacts with CHD8 (chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 8), a gene recently shown to be associated with the cause of autism and found to be upregulated in some patients tested here. These data provide a rationale for the mechanisms through which CHD8 leads to these diseases. In summary, our results suggest that ASD share deregulated pathways and revealed that SHEDs represent an alternative cell source to be used in the understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the etiology of ASD."},{"method":"Here, we provide a detailed quantitative investigation of the acoustic stapedial reflex (ASR), a three- or four-neuron brain stem circuit, in young autistic subjects and normal developing controls.","background":"Autism is a developmental disorder characterized, in part, by sensory abnormalities. It is well established that most if not all patients with autism have problems with auditory processing, ranging from deafness to hyperacusis, and physiological testing of auditory function (i.e. auditory brain stem responses) implicates brain stem dysfunction in autism. Additionally, previous research from this lab has revealed significantly fewer auditory brain stem neurons in autistic subjects as young as 2 years of age. These observations have led us to hypothesize that objective, noninvasive measures of auditory function can be used as an early screening tool to identify neonates with an elevated risk of carrying a diagnosis of autism.","conclusion":"Indeed, we find significantly lower thresholds, responses occurring at significantly longer latency and right-left asymmetry in autistic subjects. The results from this investigation support deficits in auditory function as a cardinal feature of autism and suggest that individuals with autism can be identified by their ASR responses."},{"method":"Lower order behaviors were captured by assaying the time and sequence of grooming, while higher order behaviors were measured using pattern analysis of an object exploration task from digital recordings. Baseline scores were established at 7 weeks of age, followed by 30 days of housing in either a standard or enriched cage.","background":"Lower order and higher order repetitive behaviors have been documented in the BTBR T+tf\/J (BTBR) mouse strain, a mouse model that exhibits all three core behavioral domains that define autism. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of environmental enrichment for reducing repetitive behaviors in BTBR mice.","conclusion":"As expected, BTBR mice spent significantly more time grooming and had a more rigid grooming sequence than control C57BL\/6J mice did at baseline. After 30 days of enrichment housing, BTBR mice demonstrated a significant reduction in time spent grooming, resulting in levels that were lower than those exhibited by BTBR mice in standard housing. However, no changes were noted in the rigidity of their grooming sequence. In contrast to previous findings, there was no difference in repetitive patterns of exploration at baseline between BTBR and C57BL\/6J mice in the object exploration test. Subsequently, enrichment did not significantly alter the number of repetitive patterns at posttest. Overall, the results suggest that environmental enrichment may be beneficial for reducing the time spent engaging in lower order repetitive behaviors, but may not change the overall quality of the behaviors when they do manifest."},{"method":"Therefore, we examined the empathic responsiveness in normally intelligent school-aged children and adolescents with a clinical diagnosis of ASD (n = 151) and in a typically developing comparison group (n = 50), using structured observations and parent reports.","background":"Previous studies have shown reduced empathic responsiveness to others' emotions in preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and an intellectual disability. However, age and intelligence may promote children's empathic responsiveness.","conclusion":"Based on the observations, participants' responses to the emotional displays of an interviewer were surprisingly similar. However, compared with parents from the comparison group, parents of a child with ASD reported significantly fewer empathic responses, particularly when the child received a high score on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Even though parents report a reduced empathic responsiveness in school-aged children and adolescents with ASD, it may be difficult to find these empathic limitations during brief observations in a structured setting."},{"method":"The aim of this study was to address this issue by assessing whether the emotional valence of visual scenes affects recall skills in high-functioning individuals with ASD. To this purpose, their recall performance of neutral and emotional pictures was compared with that of typically developing adults (control group).","background":"Recent empirical findings suggest a significant influence of emotion on memory processes. Surprisingly, although emotion-processing difficulties appear to be a hallmark feature in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), their impact on higher-level cognitive functions, such as memory, has not been directly studied in this population.","conclusion":"Results revealed that while typically developing individuals showed enhanced recall skills for negative relative to positive and neutral pictures, individuals with ASD recalled the neutral pictures as well as the emotional ones. Findings of this study thus point to reduced influence of emotion on memory processes in ASD than in typically developing individuals, possibly owing to amygdala dysfunctions."},{"method":"Thirty-seven students with HFASD and 54 age- and intelligence quotient (IQ)-matched peers without symptoms of ASD were assessed in a virtual classroom public speaking paradigm. This paradigm assessed the ability to attend to nine avatar peers seated at a table, while simultaneously answering self-referenced questions.","background":"Impairments in social attention play a major role in autism, but little is known about their role in development after preschool. In this study, a public speaking task was used to study social attention, its moderators, and its association with classroom learning in elementary and secondary students with higher functioning autism spectrum disorder (HFASD).","conclusion":"Students with HFASD looked less frequently to avatar peers in the classroom while talking. However, social attention was moderated in the HFASD sample such that students with lower IQ, and\/or more symptoms of social anxiety, and\/or more attention deficit\/hyperactivity disorder inattentive symptoms, displayed more atypical social attention. Group differences were more pronounced when the classroom contained social avatars versus nonsocial targets. Moreover, measures of social attention rather than nonsocial attention were significantly associated with parent report and objective measures of learning in the classroom. The data in this study support the hypothesis of the Social Attention Model of ASD that social attention disturbance remains part of the school-aged phenotype of autism that is related to syndrome-specific problems in social learning. More research of this kind would likely contribute to advances in the understanding of the development of the spectrum of autism and educational intervention approaches for affected school-aged children."},{"method":"Twenty-one children ages 6-7 years with ASD and no intellectual disability, and 21 age- and IQ-matched typically developing children participated.","background":"In this study, we explore reward-based decision making and electrodermal responding (EDR) among children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) during a children's gambling task. In addition, we examine whether individual behavioral and EDR responses predict social communication, repetitive symptoms, parent reports of executive function, and behavioral challenges. The ability to form advantageous strategies for long-term gain is of interest for children with ASD, who exhibit both difficulty with executive function and atypical responses to reward.","conclusion":"Both groups exhibited a similar pattern of gambling selections, but children with ASD showed less knowledge of the reward contingencies of the decks after playing. In addition, although EDR was similar between groups in anticipation of selections, children with ASD exhibited greater EDR during feedback about rewards as the task progressed. Children with ASD who exhibited the greatest increases in EDR were more likely to exhibit repetitive symptoms, particularly rituals and the need for sameness, as well as internalizing behaviors and reduced executive function in other settings."},{"method":"Two FB tasks (change of contents and change of location) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test were administered to 57 children with ASD and 28 TD children during a home visit. One parent of each child reported on demographics and the sibling constellation. Separate hierarchical regressions controlled for age, receptive language ability, and scores on the Social Communication Questionnaire.","background":"Research indicates a positive relation between the sibling constellation and theory of mind (ToM) development in typically developing (TD) children.

The current study examined the association among the presence and number of siblings, birth order, and false belief (FB) understanding in children with ASD and a TD comparison group.","conclusion":"In children with ASD, no association was observed between presence or number of siblings and ToM. However, the presence of older (but not younger) siblings was found to be positively associated with ToM. Children with ASD who had at least one older sibling performed similarly to the TD group, whereas children with ASD who had no older siblings performed significantly worse than the TD group. These findings indicate an advantage for FB performance in children with ASD who have an older sibling. They may bear on decisions to include older siblings or peers in intervention programs and may also contribute to a more complete understanding of the origins of individual differences in ToM ability in children with ASD."},{"method":"Here, we measured speed discrimination thresholds and motion coherence thresholds in slow (1.5 deg\/sec) and fast (6 deg\/sec) speed conditions in children with an ASC aged 7 to 14 years, and age- and ability-matched typically developing children.","background":"Consistent with the dorsal stream hypothesis, difficulties processing dynamic information have previously been reported in individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC). However, no research has systematically compared motion processing abilities for slow and fast speeds.","conclusion":"Unexpectedly, children with ASC were as sensitive as typically developing children to differences in speed at both slow and fast reference speeds. Yet, elevated motion coherence thresholds were found in children with ASC, but in the slow stimulus speed condition only. Rather than having pervasive difficulties in motion processing, as predicted by the dorsal stream hypothesis, these results suggest that children with ASC have a selective difficulty in extracting coherent motion information specifically at slow speeds. Understanding the effects of stimulus parameters such as stimulus speed will be important for resolving discrepancies between previous studies examining motion coherence thresholds in ASC and also for refining theoretical models of altered autistic perception."},{"method":"Compared to the group with typical development, children with ASD exhibited significantly greater levels of psychopathology as assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist [Achenbach, 1991], and parents of children with ASD exhibited higher parenting stress as assessed by the Parenting Stress Index [Abidin, 1995]. In a hierarchical multiple regression analysis, parenting stress emerged as the most important predictor of children's I-E problems.","background":"The current study investigated the relationships between internalizing and externalizing (I-E) behaviors and family variables, including both parenting stress and quality of attachment relations, in children aged 8-12 with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or with typical development.","conclusion":"Results are discussed in light of the two groups' similar relationships between parenting stress and child psychopathology."},{"method":"Our study aims at filling this gap by exploring empathy abilities in a group of 28 patients with high-functioning ASD and 28 gender-, age- and education-matched non-autistic subjects, for the first time by means of functional neuroimaging (fMRI).

After each clip, participants were asked to indicate their own emotion and its intensity as well as the emotion and intensity perceived for the actor.","background":"Despite remarkable behavioral gender differences in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and growing evidence for a diminished male : female ratio for the putative \"male disorder\" ASD, aspects of gender are not addressed accordingly in ASD research.","conclusion":"Behaviorally, we found significantly less empathic responses in the overall ASD group compared with non-autistic subjects, and inadequate emotion recognition for the neutral clips in the female ASD group compared with healthy women. Neurally, increased activation of the bilateral medial frontal gyrus was found in male patients compared with female patients, a pattern which was not present in the non-autistic group. Additionally, autistic women exhibited decreased activation of midbrain and limbic regions compared with non-autistic women, whereas there was no significant difference within the male group. While we did not find a fundamental empathic deficit in autistic patients, our data propose different ways of processing empathy in autistic men and women, suggesting stronger impairments in cognitive aspects of empathy\/theory of mind for men, and alterations of social reciprocity for women."},{"method":"In the current study, 21 children with ASD and 22 age- and intelligence quotient (IQ)-matched comparison participants completed, in counterbalanced order, computerised and manual versions of both a planning task and a cognitive flexibility\/set-shifting task.","background":"Across studies, analysis of performance on classic measures of executive functioning (EF) among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suggests that people with this disorder may be impaired only when tasks are experimenter-administered, but not when the same tasks are computer-administered. This would imply that the underlying cause of apparent executive dysfunction in ASD is a diminished ability to engage with another person\/comprehend what another person expects, rather than a diminution of the control processes that typically underpin EF task performance. However, this suggestion is limited because, to our knowledge, no study has directly compared the equivalence of computer-administered and standard experimenter-administered versions of EF tasks that have been presented in counterbalanced order among a common sample of individuals with ASD.","conclusion":"Contrary to expectation, results indicated that participants with ASD were equally impaired in terms of the key dependent variable on standard and computerised versions of both tasks. Practically, these results suggest that computer-administered and experimenter-administered versions of planning and set-shifting tasks are equivalent among individuals with ASD and can be used interchangeably in studies of EF among this population. Theoretically, these results challenge the notion that poor performance on EF tasks among school-aged children with ASD is only the result of a limited ability to engage with a human experimenter\/comprehend socially presented rules."},{"method":"We developed a novel assessment of imitation ability, using objective movement parameters (path length and action duration) derived from a touch-sensitive tablet laptop during drawing actions on an identical tablet. By direct comparison of the kinematics of a model's actions with those of the participant who observed them, measures of imitation accuracy were obtained. By replaying the end-point of the movement as a spot on the screen, imitation accuracy was compared against a \"ghost control\" condition, with no human actor but only the end-point of the movement seen [object movement reenactment (OMR)]. Hence, demands of the control task were closely matched to the experimental task with respect to motor, memory, and attentional abilities.","background":"Imitation is a potentially crucial aspect of social cognitive development. Although deficits in imitation ability have been widely demonstrated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the specificity and significance of the findings is unclear, due largely to methodological limitations.","conclusion":"Adolescents with ASD showed poorer accuracy for copying object size and action duration on both the imitation and OMR tasks, but were significantly more impaired for imitation of object size. Our results provide evidence that some of the imitation deficit in ASD is specific to a self-other mapping problem, and cannot be explained by general factors such as memory, spatial reasoning, motor control, or attention, nor related to the social demands of the testing situation."},{"method":"Twenty typical and 19 autistic adults donated to charity and to a person, both when alone and when observed. In an additional manipulation, for half of the participants, the observer was also the recipient of their donations, and participants were told that this observer would subsequently have the opportunity to donate to them (motivation condition). This manipulation was designed to encourage an expectation of a reciprocal \"tit-for-tat\" strategy in the participant, which may motivate participants to change their behavior to receive more donations. The remaining participants were told that the person watching was just observing the procedure (no motivation condition).","background":"Previous research has reported that autistic adults do not manage their reputation, purportedly due to problems with theory of mind [Izuma, Matsumoto, Camerer, &amp; Adolphs]. The current study aimed to test alternative explanations for this apparent lack of reputation management.","conclusion":"Our results replicated Izuma et&#x2009;al.'s finding that autistic adults did not donate more to charity when observed. Yet, in the motivation condition, both typical and autistic adults donated significantly more to the observer when watched, although this effect was significantly attenuated in autistic individuals. Results indicate that, while individuals with autism may have the ability to think about reputation, a reduced expectation of reciprocal behavior from others may reduce the degree to which they engage in reputation management."},{"method":"Using magnetoencephalography, we recorded the response of the somatosensory cortex to the passive tactile stimulation of the thumb (D1), and index finger (D2), and to the simultaneous stimulation of both fingers combined (D1,D2) of the dominant (right) hand of young subjects with and without autism. For each participant, we measured the response to the stimulation of both fingers combined (D1,D2) relative to the post hoc sum of the responses to the stimulation of each finger alone (D1+D2) in multiple different ways and linearly regressed the ASD and neurotypical (NT) groups' responses. The resulting slopes were then compared: Smaller slope values imply attenuated response to paired finger stimulation, and enhanced levels of inhibition.","background":"An established neural biomarker of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has the potential to provide novel biological and pharmacological targets for treatment. Lower level of inhibition in brain circuits is a leading biomarker candidate. A physiological investigation of the functional levels of inhibition in the cortex of individuals with autism can provide a strong test of the hypothesis. The amplitude of cortical response to the stimulation of adjacent fingers is controlled by the level of cortical inhibition and provides just such a test.","conclusion":"The short-latency M40 and mid-latency M80 response slopes of the group with autism obtained in different ways were either significantly smaller, or statistically indistinguishable from NT. The result does not support reduced inhibition in the somatosensory cortex of individuals with autism, contrary to the seminal hypothesis of reduced inhibition. Implications are discussed including refinements of current theory."},{"method":"The study recruited 20 right-handed male youths with autism and 20 carefully matched individually, typically developing (TD) youths. Microstructural integrity of the left dorsal and left ventral pathways responsible for language processing and the functional activation of the connected brain regions were investigated by using diffusion spectrum imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging of a semantic task, respectively.","background":"Deficits in language and communication are among the core symptoms of autism, a common neurodevelopmental disorder with long-term impairment. Despite the striking nature of the autistic language impairment, knowledge about its corresponding alterations in the brain is still evolving. We hypothesized that the dual stream language network is altered in autism, and that this alteration could be revealed by changes in the relationships between microstructural integrity and functional activation.","conclusion":"Youths with autism had significantly poorer language function, and lower functional activation in left dorsal and left ventral regions of the language network, compared with TD youths. The TD group showed a significant correlation of the functional activation of the left dorsal region with microstructural integrity of the left ventral pathway, whereas the autism group showed a significant correlation of the functional activation of the left ventral region with microstructural integrity of the left dorsal pathway, and moreover verbal comprehension index was correlated with microstructural integrity of the left ventral pathway. These altered structure-function relationships in autism suggest possible involvement of the dual pathways in supporting deficient semantic processing."},{"method":"This study examined the presentation of RRBs as reported on the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised, a caregiver report, in children with ASD [separated into autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified groups] compared with children with nonspectrum developmental delays or typical development. We examined the role of age, cognitive functioning, sex and social communication impairment as they relate to RRBs. The stability of RRBs in children with autism was also examined over the course of 2 years.","background":"Restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests and activities [RRBs] are among the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Previous studies have indicated that RRBs differentiate ASD from other developmental disorders and from typical development.","conclusion":"Results of the study confirmed that the amount and type of RRBs differs by diagnosis. Age, cognitive functioning, sex and social-communication impairment were not significant correlates. Among children with autism, RRBs remained stable over time."},{"method":"The present study demonstrated significant reductions in 5-HT1A receptor-binding density in superficial and deep layers of the PCC and FG, and in the density of 5-HT(2A) receptors in superficial layers of the PCC and FG. A significant reduction in the density of serotonin transporters (5-HTT) was also found in the deep layers of the FG, but normal levels were demonstrated in both layers of the PCC and superficial layers of the FG.","background":"Autism is a behaviorally defined, neurological disorder with symptom onset before the age of 3. Abnormalities in social-emotional behaviors are a core deficit in autism, and are characterized by impaired reciprocal-social interaction, lack of facial expressions, and the inability to recognize familiar faces. The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and fusiform gyrus (FG) are two regions within an extensive limbic-cortical network that contribute to social-emotional behaviors. Evidence indicates that changes in brains of individuals with autism begin prenatally. Serotonin (5-HT) is one of the earliest expressed neurotransmitters, and plays an important role in synaptogenesis, neurite outgrowth, and neuronal migration. Abnormalities in 5-HT systems have been implicated in several psychiatric disorders, including autism, as evidenced by immunology, imaging, genetics, pharmacotherapy, and neuropathology. Although information is known regarding peripheral 5-HT in autism, there is emerging evidence that 5-HT systems in the central nervous system, including various 5-HT receptor subtypes and transporters, are affected in autism.","conclusion":"This study provides potential substrates for decreased 5-HT modulation\/innervation in the autism brain, and implicate two 5-HT receptor subtypes as potential neuromarkers for novel or existing pharmacotherapies."},{"method":"We aimed to test this hypothesis by comparing the performance of a group of high-functioning unmedicated adolescents with ASD and a matched control group on a \"surprise\" face recognition memory task. We compared their memory for unfamiliar faces with their memory for images of houses. To evaluate the role that is played by peripheral cues in assisting recognition memory, we cropped both sets of pictures, retaining only the most salient central features.","background":"The ability to remember faces is critical for the development of social competence. From childhood to adulthood, we acquire a high level of expertise in the recognition of facial images, and neural processes become dedicated to sustaining competence. Many people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have poor face recognition memory; changes in hairstyle or other non-facial features in an otherwise familiar person affect their recollection skills. The observation implies that they may not use the configuration of the inner face to achieve memory competence, but bolster performance in other ways.","conclusion":"ASD adolescents had poorer recognition memory for faces than typical controls, but their recognition memory for houses was unimpaired. Cropping images of faces did not disproportionately influence their recall accuracy, relative to controls. House recognition skills (cropped and uncropped) were similar in both groups. In the ASD group only, performance on both sets of task was closely correlated, implying that memory for faces and other complex pictorial stimuli is achieved by domain-general (non-dedicated) cognitive mechanisms. Adolescents with ASD apparently do not use domain-specialized processing of inner facial cues to support face recognition memory."},{"method":"We reviewed the charts of individuals who had PTEN clinical sequencing performed at our institution from January 2008 to July 2009. There were 93 subjects tested from our institution during that period.","background":"There is a strong genetic component to autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but due to significant genetic heterogeneity, individual genetic abnormalities contribute a small percentage to the overall total. Previous studies have demonstrated PTEN mutations in a sizable proportion of individuals with ASD or mental retardation\/developmental delays (MR\/DD) and macrocephaly that do not have features of Cowden or Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome. This study was performed to confirm our previous results.","conclusion":"PTEN mutations were found in 2\/39 (5.1%) ASD patients and 2\/51 (3.9%) MR\/DD patients. Three additional patients without mutations had no diagnostic information. Multiple relatives of individuals with a PTEN mutation had macrocephaly, MR, or early onset cancer (breast, renal, and prostate). Of those relatives tested, all had the familial PTEN mutation. None of the affected relatives had previously been diagnosed with Cowden or Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome. We noted in our previous study several adult relatives without any findings who carried a mutation. Combined with data from our previous cohort, we have found PTEN mutations in 7\/99 (7.1%) of individuals with ASD and 8\/100 (8.0%) of individuals with MR\/DD, all of whom had macrocephaly. We recommend testing for mutations in PTEN for individuals with ASD or MR\/DD and macrocephaly. If mutations are found, other family members should be offered testing and the adults offered cancer screening if they have a PTEN mutation."},{"method":"The Broader Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ) was used to measure the BAP of 275 parents. Fathers not taking SSRIs (F-SSRI; n = 115) scored significantly higher on BAP Total and Aloof subscales compared to mothers not receiving treatment (M-SSRI; n = 136.) However, mothers taking SSRIs (M + SSRI; n = 19) scored higher than those not taking medication on BAP Total and Rigid subscales, and they were more likely to be BAPQ Total, Aloof, and Rigid positive.","background":"Relationships between parental broader autism phenotype (BAP) scores, gender, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment, serotonin (5HT) levels, and the child's symptoms were investigated in a family study of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).","conclusion":"Significant correlations were noted between proband autism symptoms and parental BAPQ scores such that Total, Aloof, and Rigid subscale scores of F-SSRI correlated with proband restricted repetitive behavior (RRB) measures on the ADOS, CRI, and RBS-R. However, only the Aloof subscale score of M + SSRI correlated with proband RRB on the ADOS. The correlation between the BAPQ scores of mothers taking SSRIs and child scores, as well as the increase in BAPQ scores of this group of mothers, requires careful interpretation and further study because correlations would not withstand multiple corrections. As expected by previous research, significant parent-child correlations were observed for 5HT levels. However, 5HT levels were not correlated with behavioral measures. Study results suggest that the expression of the BAP varies not only across parental gender, but also across individuals using psychotropic medication and those who do not."},{"method":"We describe findings from individuals diagnosed with ASD before age five, who now have no symptoms (e.g., having optimal outcomes).","background":"The autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders diagnosed behaviorally but associated with differences in brain development. Individuals with ASD exhibit superior auditory perceptual skills, which may correlate with ASD symptomatology, particularly language skills.","conclusion":"Unlike an ASD group, which shows heightened pitch discrimination, the Optimal Outcome group's abilities do not differ from those of typically developing controls. Furthermore, pitch discrimination is associated with both current autism symptomatology and early-language milestones. Findings illuminate processes associated with resolution of autism. We also discuss a specific mechanism by which heightened auditory discrimination leads to language delays in ASD."},{"method":"This study examined autonomic responses (skin conductance level and heart rate) and subjective responses to social vs. nonsocial pictures in 37 adolescents with an ASD and 36 typically developing (TD) adolescents. Thirty-six pictures from the International Affective Picture System were presented, divided into six categories based on social content (social vs. nonsocial) and pleasantness (pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant).","background":"It remains unclear why individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) tend to respond in an atypical manner in social situations. Investigating autonomic and subjective responses to social vs. nonsocial stimuli may help to reveal underlying mechanisms of these atypical responses.","conclusion":"Both in adolescents with ASD as well as TD adolescents, pictures with a social content resulted in higher skin conductance responses (SCRs) for pleasant and unpleasant pictures than for neutral pictures. No differences in SCRs were found for the three nonsocial picture categories. Unpleasant pictures, both with and without a social content, showed more heart rate deceleration than neutral pictures. Self-reported arousal ratings were influenced by the social and affective content of a picture. No differences were found between individuals with ASD and TD individuals in their autonomic and subjective responses to the picture categories. These results suggest that adolescents with ASD do not show atypical autonomic or subjective responses to pictures with and without a social content. These findings make it less likely that impairments in social information processing in individuals with ASD can be explained by atypical autonomic responses to social stimuli."},{"method":"Participants were 31 10- to 17-year-old children with an ASD diagnosis that was supported by gold-standard measures and their biological mothers. Mothers completed the Autism Comorbidity Interview to determine whether the child with ASD met criteria for any depressive or anxiety diagnoses and a questionnaire of their own current mood symptoms.","background":"Research suggests that children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and their relatives have high rates of depression and anxiety. However, relatively few studies have looked at both factors concurrently. This study examined the potential relationship between maternal mood symptoms and depression and anxiety in their children with ASD.","conclusion":"As expected, many children with ASD met criteria for lifetime diagnoses of depressive (32%) and anxiety disorders (39%). Mothers' report of their own current mood symptoms revealed averages within the normal range, though there was significant variability. Approximately 75% of children with ASD could be correctly classified as having a depressive or anxiety disorder history or not based on maternal symptoms of interpersonal sensitivity, hostility, phobic anxiety, depression, and anxiety. The results provide preliminary evidence that maternal mood symptoms may be related to depression and anxiety in their children with ASD. Although the design did not allow for testing of heritability per se, the familial transmission patterns were generally consistent with research in typical populations. While larger follow-up studies are needed, this research has implications for prevention and intervention efforts."},{"method":"Therefore, we performed global histogram analyses of (a) whole-brain tractography results and (b) skeletonized WM masks. In addition to the FA and MD, the planar diffusion coefficient (CP) was computed as it can provide more specific information of the complexity of the neural structure.","background":"To investigate whether there are global white matter (WM) differences between autistic and healthy adults, we performed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 14 male adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) and 19 gender-, age-, and intelligence quotient-matched controls. We focused on individuals with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD), AS, to decrease heterogeneity caused by large variation in the cognitive profile. Previous DTI studies of ASD have mainly focused on finding local changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), two indexes used to characterize microstructural properties of WM. Although the local or voxel-based approaches may be able to provide detailed information in terms of location of the observed differences, such results are known to be highly sensitive to partial volume effects, registration errors, or placement of the regions of interest.","conclusion":"Our main finding indicated that adults with AS had higher mean FA values than controls. A less complex neural structure in adults with AS could have explained the results, but no significant difference in CP was found. Our results suggest that there are global abnormalities in the WM tissue of adults with AS."},{"method":"The present study aimed to investigate the impact of temporal changes on encoding and recall of speech, and the associated cognitive, clinical, and behavioral correlates in adults with ASD. Research carried out with typically developing (TD) adults has shown that word recall diminishes as the speed of speech increases, and it was predicted that the magnitude of this effect would be far greater in those with ASD because of a preexisting rapid temporal processing deficit. Nineteen high-functioning adults with ASD, and age- and intelligence-matched TD controls performed verbatim recall of temporally manipulated sentences.","background":"While temporal and perceptual processing abnormalities, identified in a number of electrophysiological and brain imaging studies of individuals with (ASD), are likely to impact on speech perception, surprisingly little is known about the behavioral outcomes of such abnormalities. It has been hypothesized that rapid temporal processing deficits may be linked to impaired language development through interference with acoustic information during speech perception.","conclusion":"Reduced levels of word recall in response to increases in presentation speed were observed, and this effect was greater in the older participants in the ASD group than in the control group. This is the first study to show that both sensory abnormalities and aging impact on speech encoding in ASD. Auditory processing deficits in ASD may be indicative of an association with the sensory abnormalities and social and communication impairments characterizing the disorder."},{"method":"In this paper, our goals were to first define the population and then present general guidelines for optimizing assessment sessions for this challenging population. We then summarize the available measures that can be used across a variety of behavioral domains that are most directly relevant to developing language skills, including oral motor skills, vocal repertoire, receptive and expressive language, imitation, intentional communication, play, social behavior, repetitive and sensory behaviors, and nonverbal cognition.","background":"This paper addresses the issue of assessing communication, language, and associated cognitive and behavioral abilities of minimally verbal children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), presenting a summary of a year-long series of meetings held by a group of experts in the field of ASD and National Institutes of Health staff.","conclusion":"We conclude with a discussion of some of the limitations in the available measures and highlight recommendations for future research in this area."},{"method":"Contrast thresholds for object discrimination were compared between groups with high and low self-rated autistic tendency utilizing the socially based Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Visual stimuli were presented with either abrupt or with ramped contrast onsets\/offsets in order to manipulate the demands of transient attention.","background":"Autism is usually defined by impairments in the social domain but has also been linked to deficient dorsal visual stream processing. However, inconsistent findings make the nature of this relationship unclear and thus, we examined the role of stimulus-driven transient attention, presumably activated by the dorsal stream in autistic tendency.","conclusion":"Larger impairments in performance of abrupt compared with ramped object presentation were established in the high AQ group. Furthermore, self-reported social skills predicted abrupt task performance, suggesting an important visual perception deficiency in autism-related traits. Autism spectrum disorder may be associated with reduced utilization of the dorsal stream to rapidly activate attention prior to ventral stream processing when stimuli are transient."},{"method":"In a case-control design, 35 ASD patients and 40 matched NTD controls were tested in a psychophysiological test battery. The PPI of the acoustic startle reflex was analyzed in 18 ASD subjects and 34 NTD controls. Habituation and sensitization were analyzed in 23 ASD subjects and 39 NTD controls.","background":"The relation between autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia is a subject of intense debate and research due to evidence of common neurobiological pathways in the two disorders. The objective of this study was to explore whether deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex, as usually seen in schizophrenic patients, can be replicated in a group of children with ASD in comparison with a group of matched neuro-typically developed (NTD) controls. An additional aim was to explore possible psychophysiological subgroups within our ASD sample.","conclusion":"In trials with less intense prestimuli (76 dB), patients with ASD did not display the drop in percentage PPI normally found in healthy controls. In addition, ASD patients showed significantly increased sensitization compared with NTD controls. Combined, our results may reflect the hypersensitivity to sensory information in children with ASD. The relation to PPI deficits observed in schizophrenia is not apparent. Future research should study the developmental course of PPI deficits in ASD patients in a longitudinal design."},{"method":"Mice injected subcutaneously with 600 mg\/kg valproic acid (VPA600) at gestational day 12.5 show reduced social interaction in adulthood (at 8 weeks of age), and they have been proposed as a mouse model of autism. Here, we show that these adult animals present signs of chronic glial activation in the hippocampus and the cerebellum. Moreover, when they are challenged with a peripheral inflammatory stimulus (intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharides, LPS), VPA600 animals show an exacerbated inflammatory response.","background":"Increasing clinical and experimental evidence links immune and inflammatory alterations with the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Autistic individuals show signs of neuroinflammation, altered inflammatory responses, and immune abnormalities throughout life.","conclusion":"Two hours after LPS injection, VPA600 animals secrete more corticosterone to the blood than control mice, and show an increase in the levels of expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the spleen. After LPS challenge, VPA600 mice also show signs of increased neuroinflammation compared with control mice: they have more microglial cells in the hippocampus, and they show higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the cerebellum. Our results provide evidence of basal neuroinflammation and an altered inflammatory response in the VPA model of autism. We propose that this model can be used to evaluate the contribution of inflammatory reactivity to autism-related behaviors. These studies will contribute to elucidate the role of the inflammatory alterations observed in ASD individuals."},{"method":"In the current electroencephalographic study, we investigated mu suppression, indicating neural mirroring in children with ASD between the ages of 24 and 48 months and age-matched typically developing children, during observation of goal-directed actions and non-goal-directed mimicked hand movements, as well as during action execution.","background":"Investigating the underlying neural mechanisms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has recently been influenced by the discovery of mirror neurons. These neurons, active during both observation and execution of actions, are thought to play a crucial role in imitation and other social-communicative skills that are often impaired in ASD.","conclusion":"Results revealed no significant group differences with significant central mu suppression in the ASD children and control children during both execution and observation of goal-directed actions and during observation of hand movements. Furthermore, no significant correlations between mu suppression on one hand and quality of imitation, age, and social communication questionnaire scores on the other hand were found. These findings challenge the \"broken mirror\" hypothesis of ASD, suggesting that impaired neural mirroring is not a distinctive feature of ASD."},{"method":"To resolve this issue, we adopt an index of Gestalt grouping from the object-based attention literature that does not require participants to assess their own grouping perception. Children with ASD and mental- and chronological-age matched typically developing children (TD) performed speeded orientation discriminations of two diagonal lines. The lines were superimposed on circles that were either grouped together or segmented on the basis of color, proximity or these two dimensions in competition. The magnitude of performance benefits evident for grouped circles, relative to ungrouped circles, provided an index of grouping under various conditions.","background":"A pervasive integration deficit could provide a powerful and elegant account of cognitive processing in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, in the case of visual Gestalt grouping, typically assessed by tasks that require participants explicitly to introspect on their own grouping perception, clear evidence for such a deficit remains elusive.","conclusion":"Children with ASD showed comparable grouping by proximity to the TD group, but reduced grouping by similarity. ASD seems characterized by a selective bias away from grouping by similarity combined with typical levels of grouping by proximity, rather than by a pervasive integration deficit."},{"method":"In this study, we sought to restrict FMRP deletion to two brain regions that have been implicated in FXS and autism.","background":"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited mental retardation and the leading cause of autism. FXS is caused by mutation in a single gene, FMR1, which encodes an RNA-binding protein FMRP. FMRP is highly expressed in neurons and is hypothesized to have a role in synaptic structure, function, and plasticity by regulating mRNAs that encode pre- and post-synaptic proteins. Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice have been used as a model to study FXS. These mice have been reported to show a great degree of phenotypic variability based on the genetic background, environmental signals, and experimental methods.","conclusion":"We show that ablating Fmr1 in differentiated neurons of hippocampus and cortex results in dendritic alterations and changes in synaptic marker intensity that are brain region specific. In our conditional mutant mice, FMRP-deleted neurons have activated AKT-mTOR pathway signaling in hippocampus but display no apparent behavioral phenotypes. These results highlight the importance of identifying additional factors that interact with Fmr1 to develop FXS."},{"method":"Samples of children with autism, Asperger syndrome, and Down syndrome, as well as a typically developing sample, were presented with an auditory-only condition, a speech-reading condition, and an audiovisual condition designed to elicit the McGurk effect.","background":"Children with autism may have difficulties in audiovisual speech perception, which has been linked to speech perception and language development. However, little has been done to examine children with Asperger syndrome as a group on tasks assessing audiovisual speech perception, despite this group's often greater language skills.","conclusion":"Children with autism demonstrated unimodal performance at the same level as the other groups, yet showed a lower rate of the McGurk effect compared with the Asperger, Down and typical samples. These results suggest that children with autism may have unique intermodal speech perception difficulties linked to their representations of speech sounds."},{"method":"We analyzed genes of the superoxide dismutase family (SOD1, SOD2, and SOD3) that are part of a major antioxidative stress system in human in order to detect the genetic variants contributing to the development of ASD. Using the optimized high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis, we identified two rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the etiology of ASD.","background":"Oxidative stress is suspected to be one of the several contributing factors in the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).","conclusion":"Both are located in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene and have a minor allele frequency in healthy population ~5%. The SNP c.239 + 34A&gt;C (rs2234694) and SNP g.3341C&gt;G (rs36233090) were detected with an odds ratio of 2.65 and P &lt; 0.01. Both are located in the noncoding potentially regulatory regions of the SOD1 gene. This adds to the importance of rare SNPs in the etiology of complex diseases as well as to the importance of noncoding genetic variants analysis with a potential influence on the regulation of gene expression."},{"method":"we applied 30&#x2009;minutes of diagnostic ultrasound to pregnant mice at embryonic day 14.5 and assayed the social behavior of their male pups 3 weeks after their birth.","background":"Clinical use of diagnostic ultrasound imaging during pregnancy has a long history of safety and diagnostic utility, as supported by numerous human case reports and epidemiological studies. However, there exist in vivo studies linking large but clinically relevant doses of ultrasound applied to mouse fetuses in utero to altered learning, memory, and neuroanatomy of those mice. Also, there exists a well-documented significant increase in the likelihood of non-right-handedness in boys exposed to diagnostic ultrasound in utero, potentially relevant given the increased prevalence of autism in males, and reports of excess non-right-handedness in this population. Motivated by these observations,","conclusion":"The ultrasound-exposed pups were significantly (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01) less interested in social interaction than sham-exposed pups in a three-chamber sociability test. In addition, they demonstrated significantly (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) more activity relative to the sham-exposed pups, but only in the presence of an unfamiliar mouse. These results suggest that fetal exposure to diagnostic ultrasound applied in utero can alter typical social behaviors in young mice that may be relevant for autism. There exist meaningful differences between the exposure of diagnostic ultrasound to mice versus humans that require further exploration before this work can usefully inform clinical practice. Future work should address these differences as well as clarify the extent, mechanisms, and functional effects of diagnostic ultrasound's interaction with the developing brain."},{"method":"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) located within the GABA receptor (GABAR) subunit genes GABRA1, GABRG2, GABRB3, and GABRD were screened. A hundred and thirty-six Argentinean ASD patients and 150 controls were studied, and the contribution of the SNPs in the etiology of ASD was evaluated independently and\/or through gene-gene interaction using multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method.","background":"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) can be conceptualized as a genetic dysfunction that disrupts development and function of brain circuits mediating social cognition and language. At least some forms of ASD may be associated with high level of excitation in neural circuits, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been implicated in its etiology.","conclusion":"From the 18 SNP studied, 11 were not present in our Argentinean population (patients and controls) and 1 SNP had minor allele frequency &lt; 0.1%. For the remaining six SNPs, none provided statistical significant association with ASD when considering allelic or genotypic frequencies. Non-significant association with ASD was found for the haplotype analysis. MDR identified evidence for synergy between markers in GABRB3 (chromosome 15) and GABRD (chromosome 1), suggesting potential gene-gene interaction across chromosomes associated with increased risk for autism (testing balanced accuracy: 0.6081 and cross-validation consistency: 10\/10, P &lt; 0.001). Considering our Argentinean ASD sample, it can be inferred that GABRB3 would be involved in the etiology of autism through interaction with GABRD. These results support the hypothesis that GABAR subunit genes are involved in autism, most likely via complex gene-gene interactions."},{"method":"In this study, we specifically addressed age-related changes in visual search. We examined conjunctive visual search in groups of children with (n = 34) and without ASD (n = 35) at 7-9 years of age when visual search performance is beginning to improve, and later, at 10-12 years, when performance has improved.","background":"Visual-spatial strengths observed among people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be associated with increased efficiency of selective attention mechanisms such as visual search. In a series of studies, researchers examined the visual search of targets that share features with distractors in a visual array and concluded that people with ASD showed enhanced performance on visual search tasks. However, methodological limitations, the small sample sizes, and the lack of developmental analysis have tempered the interpretations of these results.","conclusion":"The results were consistent with previous developmental findings; 10- to 12-year-old children were significantly faster visual searchers than their 7- to 9-year-old counterparts. However, we found no evidence of enhanced search performance among the children with ASD at either the younger or older ages. More research is needed to understand the development of visual search in both children with and without ASD."},{"method":"Therefore, we sought to replicate our findings in the neuroligin-3 R451C point mutant knock-in mouse model (NL3R451C) in a different genetic background. We backcrossed our NL3R451C mouse line onto a 129S2\/SvPasCrl genetic background and repeated a subset of our previous behavioral testing.","background":"Multiple candidate genes have been identified for autism spectrum disorders. While some of these genes reach genome-wide significance, others, such as the R451C point mutation in the synaptic cell adhesion molecule neuroligin-3, appear to be rare. Interestingly, two brothers with the same R451C point mutation in neuroligin-3 present clinically on seemingly disparate sides of the autism spectrum. These clinical findings suggest genetic background may play a role in modifying the penetrance of a particular autism-associated mutation. Animal models may contribute additional support for such mutations as functionally relevant and can provide mechanistic insights. Previously, in collaboration with the S&#xfc;dhof laboratory, we reported that mice with an R451C substitution in neuroligin-3 displayed social deficits and enhanced spatial learning. While some of these behavioral abnormalities have since been replicated independently in the S&#xfc;dhof laboratory, observations from the Crawley laboratory failed to replicate these findings in a similar neuroligin-3 mutant mouse model and suggested that genetic background may contribute to variation in observations across laboratories.","conclusion":"NL3R451C mice on a 129S2\/SvPasCrl displayed social deficits, enhanced spatial learning, and increased locomotor activity. These data extend our previous findings that NL3R451C mice exhibit autism-relevant behavioral abnormalities and further suggest that different genetic backgrounds can modify this behavioral phenotype through epistatic genetic interactions."},{"method":"In this study, the possibility of maternal genotype effects was examined by looking for common variants (single-nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) in the maternal genome associated with increased risk of autism in children. A case\/control genome-wide association study was performed using mothers of probands as cases, and either fathers of probands or normal females as controls. Autism Genetic Resource Exchange and Illumina Genotype Control Database were used as our discovery cohort (n = 1616). The same analysis was then replicated on Simon Simplex Collection and Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment datasets (n = 2732).","background":"Like most psychiatric disorders, autism spectrum disorders have both a genetic and an environmental component. While previous studies have clearly demonstrated the contribution of in utero (prenatal) environment on autism risk, most of them focused on transient environmental factors. Based on a recent sibling study, we hypothesized that environmental factors could also come from the maternal genome, which would result in persistent effects across siblings.","conclusion":"We did not identify any SNP that reached genome-wide significance (P &lt; 10(-8) ), and thus a common variant of large effect is unlikely.

No group differences in intrahemispheric coherence at the alpha frequency emerged at the chosen statistical threshold.

Model-based cluster analysis was used to extract sensory subtypes. The relationship of these subtypes to age, gender, autism symptom severity, and nonverbal intelligence quotient (IQ) was further explored.","background":"This study examines whether sensory differences can be used to classify meaningful subgroups of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).","conclusion":"Four distinct sensory subtypes were identified: (a) sensory adaptive; (b) taste smell sensitive; (c) postural inattentive; and (d) generalized sensory difference. The sensory subtypes differ from each other on two dimensions: (a) the severity of reported sensory differences; and (b) the focus of differences across auditory, taste, smell, vestibular and proprioceptive domains. Examination of the clinical features of each subtype reveals two possible mechanisms of sensory disturbance in autism: (a) sensory hyperreactivity; and (b) difficulties with multisensory processing. Further, the sensory subtypes are not well explained by other variables such as age, gender, IQ, and autism symptom severity. We conclude that classification of children using sensory differences offers a promising method by which to identify phenotypes in ASD. Sensory-based phenotypes may be useful in identifying behavioral features responsive to specific interventions thereby improving intervention effectiveness. Further validation of the sensory-based phenotypes by establishing neural and physiological correlates is recommended."},{"method":"Here we tested the integrity of these alpha-band mechanisms in ASD using an intersensory attention task. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while participants were cued on a trial-by-trial basis to selectively deploy attention to the visual or auditory modality in anticipation of a target within the cued modality.","background":"When attention is directed to one information stream over another, the brain can be configured in advance to selectively process the relevant stream and suppress potentially distracting inputs. One key mechanism of suppression is through the deployment of anticipatory alpha-band (~10 Hz) oscillatory activity, with greater alpha-band power observed in cortical regions that will ultimately process the distracting stream. Atypical attention has been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including greater interference by distracting task-irrelevant inputs.","conclusion":"Whereas typically developing (TD) children showed the predicted alpha-band modulation, with increased alpha-band power over parieto-occipital scalp when attention was deployed to the auditory compared with the visual modality, this differential pattern was entirely absent at the group level in the ASD cohort. Further, only the ASD group showed impaired performance due to the presence of task-irrelevant sensory information. These data suggest that impaired modulation of alpha-band activity plays a role in increased distraction from extraneous sensory inputs in ASD."},{"method":"Intelligence profiles were measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and compared among four consecutive age cohorts (children aged 6.17-8.03 years, 8.04-9.61 years, and 9.68-11.50 years and adolescents aged 11.54-15.85 years) of 237 high-functioning boys with ASD.","background":"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with early disturbances in brain maturation processes and these interferences presumably have their consequences for the progressive emergence of cognitive deficits later in life, as expressed in intelligence profiles. In this study, we addressed the impact of age on cognitive functioning of 6- to 15-year-old children and adolescents with ASD.","conclusion":"The results clearly demonstrated that the global intelligence level was lower in children aged 8 years and older, when compared with 6- and 7-year-old children with ASD. This is mostly due to the Freedom From Distractibility factor, suggesting that older children were less able to sustain their attention, they were more distractible, or had more graph motor difficulties. Moreover, an effect of age was also found with respect to the relatively poor performance on the subtest Comprehension when compared with other verbal comprehension subtests, indicating that specifically the impairments in verbal comprehension and social reasoning abilities were more profound in older children when compared with 6- and 7-year-old children with ASD. Findings of this cross-sectional study showed that it is relevant to take age into account when evaluating the impact of cognitive impairments on intelligence in children with ASD, because the impact of these developmental disorders might be different at different ages."},{"method":"In the present study, two experiments were conducted to determine whether high-functioning adults with ASD also show diminished aftereffects for facial identity and expression. In Experiment 1, using a procedure that minimized the contribution of low-level retinotopic adaptation, we observed substantial aftereffects comparable to those seen in matched controls, for both facial identity and expression. A similar pattern of results was seen in Experiment 2 using a revised procedure that increased the contribution of retinotopic adaptation to the facial aftereffects observed.","background":"Adaptation paradigms seek to bias subsequently viewed stimuli through prolonged exposure to an adapting stimulus, thereby giving rise to an aftereffect. Recent experiments have found that children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show reduced facial aftereffects, prompting some researchers to speculate that all individuals with ASD exhibit deficient facial adaptation. However, caution is required when generalizing findings from samples of children with ASD to the wider ASD population. The reduced facial aftereffects seen in child samples may instead reflect delayed or atypical developmental trajectories, whereby individuals with ASD are slower to develop adaptive mechanisms.","conclusion":"That adults with autism can show robust facial aftereffects raises the possibility that group differences are seen only at particular points during development, and may not be a lifelong feature of the condition."},{"method":"EDA was recorded on 54 young children with ASD and on 33 children with typical development (TD) during a protocol that included baseline, exposure to sensory and repetitive stimuli, and play. Parents completed standardized questionnaires regarding their child's sensory symptoms and repetitive behaviors. Frequency and type of repetitive behavior during play was coded offline.","background":"Parents frequently report that their children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) respond atypically to sensory stimuli. Repetitive behaviors are also part of the ASD behavioral profile. Abnormal physiological arousal may underlie both of these symptoms. Electrodermal activity (EDA) is an index of sympathetic nervous system arousal. The goals of this study were twofold: (1) to pilot methods for collecting EDA data in young children and (2) to examine hypothesized relationships among EDA, and sensory symptoms and repetitive behaviors in children with ASD as compared with children with typical development.","conclusion":"Comparisons between EDA data for ASD and TD groups indicated no significant between-group differences in any measures. Parents of children with ASD reported more abnormal responses to sensory stimuli and more repetitive behaviors, but scores on these measures were not significantly correlated with EDA or with frequency of observed repetitive behaviors. Parent report of frequency and severity of sensory symptoms was significantly correlated with reports of repetitive behaviors in both groups. Although parents of children with ASD report high levels of sensory symptoms and repetitive behaviors, these differences are not related to measured EDA arousal or reactivity."},{"method":"Here, we tested transmission disequilibrium of rs6311 and rs6314 in a cohort of 158 ASD trios (simplex and multiplex), observing significant under-transmission of the minor \"A\" allele of rs6311 to offspring with ASD (permuted P = 0.0004). Consistent with our previous findings in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of unaffected individuals, rs6311\/A decreases expression of HTR2A mRNA with an extended 5' untranslated region (UTR) in the frontopolar cortex in brain samples from 54 ASD patients and controls.","background":"The serotonin 2A receptor gene (HTR2A) harbors two functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are frequent in populations of African and European descent; rs6311, which affects mRNA expression, and rs6314, which changes the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein and affects the signaling properties of the receptor. Multiple clinical associations support a role for these SNPs in cognitive and neuropsychiatric phenotypes, although studies in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain equivocal.","conclusion":"Interpreting the clinical results in the context of our mRNA expression analysis, we speculate that any risk associated with rs6311 is conferred by greater expression of the long 5'UTR mRNA isoform. The current study corroborates earlier associations between rs6311 and ASD in a family study, supporting the hypothesis that rs6311 plays a modulatory role in ASD risk."},{"method":"2D:4D ratios and digit lengths of 216 children with ASD, 202 unaffected siblings, and 360 parents were compared with those of 174 control children and their 146 parents. Generalized Estimation Equations, Generalized Linear Models, and Linear Mixed Models were used to investigate parent-offspring relationships and group differences.","background":"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) may be an extreme manifestation of some male-typical traits in both neuroanatomy and cognition. Using the ratio of the second to fourth digit (2D:4D) and digit length as biomarkers of (pre- and postnatal) testosterone levels, examined was whether hypermasculinized digit ratios and\/or lengths were familial traits in ASD and investigated their relation to sexually dimorphic cognitive abilities.","conclusion":"In ASD probands and their relatives alike, digit length relative to overall height was significantly increased in comparison to controls. No significant group differences were found between affected and unaffected subjects, or between males and females. Additionally, 2D:4D ratios increased with age. No (consistent) associations were found between 2D:4D ratio or digit lengths and systemizing and empathizing skills. The findings emphasize the role of familially based elevated pre- and postnatal testosterone levels in the liability for ASD, but challenge the use of 2D:4D ratio as a proxy of prenatal testosterone exposure solely. Given that many genes influence digit length, the exact mechanisms underlying a familial predisposition toward increased digit length in ASD are as yet unknown and needs to be explored in future studies."},{"method":"The present study sought to investigate whether porphyrin profiles can reliably be used to (a) differentiate ASD cases from healthy controls; and (b) predict ASD severity. The study compared the porphyrin levels of three groups of children aged 2-6 years: Group 1-children diagnosed with ASD (n = 70); Group 2-healthy, normally developing siblings of children diagnosed with ASD (n = 36); and Group 3-healthy, normally developing children with no known blood relative diagnosed with ASD (n = 54).","background":"A fundamental challenge to the timely diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is the reliance on the observation of a set of aberrant behavior. Consequently, the diagnostic process requires that the child reach an age where the behaviors would typically be exhibited. The identification of a reliable biological marker (biomarker) could be of considerable benefit to the diagnostic process. As a diagnostic biomarker, porphyrins present an attractive prospect as previous studies have reported consistent findings of children with ASD showing significant elevations in porphyrin levels in contrast to controls. Furthermore, there is some evidence that ASD severity may be associated with porphyrins, which would be a valuable characteristic of any ASD biomarker. Importantly, for practical use, porphyrins can be tested non-invasively via a sample of urine.","conclusion":"The results of logistic regression analyses failed to find support for the hypotheses that porphyrin levels could be used as a valid tool to detect ASD cases or predict severity."},{"method":"This study describes the clinical characteristics, associated comorbid disorders, and endoscopic and colonoscopic evaluation of GI dysfunction in a cohort of 164 children with ASD evaluated at a pediatric neurology practice.","background":"Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunctions are frequently reported by parents of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and have been recently recognized as a comorbid condition. However, the clinical significance of these GI dysfunctions remains to be delineated.","conclusion":"Symptoms of GI dysfunction were prevalent: 49% of the children reported one or more chronic GI complaints, 22% exhibited diarrhea, 26% suffered from constipation. Furthermore 13% of the parents reported their children to suffer from bloating and\/or being gassy and while 10% of the parents reported vomiting or gastroesophageal reflux problems. Similar rates of GI symptoms were reported among pre-school and school-aged children. Inflammation of the gut was found in 6 of the 12 subjects who underwent endoscopic and colonoscopic evaluations, however clinical symptoms did not predict the results of the evaluation. GI dysfunction was significantly associated with sleep disorders and food intolerance, but not with irritability or aggressiveness. In summary, GI dysfunction was prevalent in this cohort of children with ASD, observations consistent with the reports of parents and other clinicians. We conclude that the GI dysfunction in ASD requires proper evaluation and treatment."},{"method":"In this study, 21 high-functioning children and adolescents with ASD and 22 age and gender group-matched typically developing (TD) controls completed a Reactivity and Regulation Situation Task. This task assesses emotional reactivity and spontaneous use of emotion regulation strategies (problem solving, cognitive reappraisal, avoidance, distraction, venting, suppression, and relaxation) in the context of age-appropriate ambiguous and potentially threatening negative scenarios. After the concept of cognitive reappraisal was explained, the scenarios were presented again to participants, and they were prompted to use this strategy.","background":"Emotion dysregulation is not a formal criterion for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, parents and clinicians have long noted the importance of emotional problems in individuals with ASD (e.g. tantrums and \"meltdowns\").","conclusion":"Results indicated that individuals with ASD exhibited the same level of reactivity to negative stimuli as TD participants. Furthermore, youth with ASD had a different emotion regulation profile than TD individuals, characterized by a less frequent use of cognitive reappraisal and more frequent use of suppression. When prompted to use cognitive reappraisal, participants with ASD were less able to implement reappraisal, but benefitted from this strategy when they were able to generate a reappraisal. Findings from this study suggest that cognitive reappraisal strategies may be useful to children and adolescents with ASD. Therefore, the development of treatment programs that focus on enhancing the use of adaptive forms of emotion regulation might decrease emotional problems and optimize long-term outcomes in youth with ASD."},{"method":"Mutation of a critical aspartate to alanine (D1046A) in the PTPRT catalytic domain inactivates phosphatase function but retains substrate binding. We have generated a knockin mouse line carrying the PTPRT D1046A mutation.","background":"Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase rho (RPTP&#x3c1;, gene symbol PTPRT) is a transmembrane protein expressed at high levels in the developing hippocampus, olfactory bulb, cortex, and cerebellum. It has an extracellular domain that interacts with other cell adhesion molecules, and it has two intracellular phosphatase domains, one of which is catalytically active. In a recent genome-wide association study, PTPRT was identified as a potential candidate gene for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) susceptibility.","conclusion":"The D1046A mutation in homozygous knockin mice did not significantly change locomotor activities or anxiety-related behaviors. In contrast, male homozygous mice had significantly higher social approach scores than wild-type animals. Our results suggest that PTPRT phosphatase function is important in modulating neural pathways involved in mouse social behaviors relevant to the symptoms in human ASD patients."},{"method":"Ten children with ASD and their mothers participated. The children's social behaviors were observed prior to and following a 3-min period in which an adult social partner imitated everything they did. In one condition the partner was the child's mother, and in the other condition the partner was an unfamiliar experimenter.","background":"Previous research suggests that being imitated by an adult increases the social behaviors of children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In the current study, we examined whether familiarity with the imitating social partner modulates this effect.","conclusion":"The results revealed significant increases in distal social behaviors (gazes toward the adult, vocalizing) following imitation by both partners. There was a significantly greater increase in proximal social behaviors (including approach, being physically close, and touching) and a greater decrease in playing alone when the imitator was the child's mother as opposed to the experimenter. The findings suggest that the experience of being imitated creates an atmosphere of mutuality and rapport between children with ASD and their social partners, which increases their sociability even in interactions with already familiar adults."},{"method":"We analyzed published abstracts presented at IMFAR meetings, between 2008 and 2013, to determine patterns of collaboration. We described collaboration networks on the individual, institutional, and international levels, and visually depicted these results on spatial network maps.","background":"In the era of globalization and with the emergence of autism spectrum disorder as a global concern, the landscape of autism research has expanded to encompass much of the world. Here, we seek to provide an overview of the world of autism research, by documenting collaboration underlying the International Meeting for Autism Research (IMFAR), the pre-eminent annual scientific meeting devoted to the presentation of the latest autism research.","conclusion":"Consistent with findings from other scientific disciplines, we found that collaboration is correlated with research productivity. Collaborative hotspots of autism research throughout the years were clustered on the East and West coasts of the U.S., Canada, and northern Europe. In years when conferences were held outside of North America, the proportion of abstracts from Europe and Asia increased. While IMFAR has traditionally been dominated by a large North American presence, greater global representation may be attained by shifting meeting locations to other regions of the world."},{"method":"Here, we describe the first case of a familial mutation of MET, consisting of an interstitial genomic deletion removing exons 12 through 15, causing a frameshift and premature stop codon, with evidence of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. On the other allele, patients carried the C allele of the MET promoter rs1858830 polymorphism, known to decrease MET expression and previously associated with autism susceptibility.","background":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) results from interactions of genetic and environmental factors. The MET proto-oncogene has been identified as a candidate gene for autism susceptibility, and is implicated in neurodevelopment and social brain circuitry.","conclusion":"The heterozygous mutation was associated with autism in one patient, and language and social impairment in a sibling. Our observations delineate the phenotypic spectrum associated with a clearly defined, very likely complete loss of function mutation of MET. Incomplete penetrance in this family was consistent with MET as a partial susceptibility gene for ASD. Implication of MET in normal and pathological brain development opens new perspectives for understanding the pathophysiology of autism and for eventual therapeutical clues."},{"method":"We conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study on the anti-saccade task, a probe of inhibitory control, in high-functioning adolescents and adults with ASD compared to a matched group of typically developing (TD) individuals.","background":"The development of inhibitory control-the ability to suppress inappropriate actions in order to make goal-directed responses-is often impaired in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In the present study, we examined whether the impairments in inhibitory control evident in ASD reflect-in part-differences in the development of the neural substrates of inhibitory control from adolescence into adulthood.","conclusion":"The ASD group did not show the age-related improvements in behavioral performance from adolescence to adulthood evident in the typical group, consistent with previous behavioral work. The fMRI results indicated that much of the circuitry recruited by the ASD group was similar to the TD group. However, the ASD group demonstrated some unique patterns, including: (a) a failure to recruit the frontal eye field during response preparation in adolescence but comparable recruitment in adulthood; (b) greater recruitment of putamen in adolescence and precuneus in adolescence and adulthood than the TD group; and (c) decreased recruitment in the inferior parietal lobule relative to TD groups. Taken together, these results suggest that brain circuitry underlying inhibitory control develops differently from adolescence to adulthood in ASD. Specifically, there may be relative underdevelopment of brain processes underlying inhibitory control in ASD, which may lead to engagement of subcortical compensatory processes."},{"method":"BDNF concentrations were measured in archived mid-pregnancy and neonatal blood specimens drawn during routine prenatal and newborn screening using a highly sensitive bead-based assay (Luminex, Biosource Human BDNF Antibody Bead Kit, Invitrogen-Biosource, Carlsbad, CA).","background":"To investigate levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in mid-pregnancy and neonatal blood specimens as early biologic markers for autism, we conducted a population-based case-control study nested within the cohort of infants born from July 2000 to September 2001 to women who participated in the prenatal screening program in Orange County, CA. Cases (n=84) were all children receiving services for autism at the Regional Center of Orange County. Two comparison groups from the same study population were included: children with mental retardation or developmental delay (n=49) receiving services at the same regional center, and children not receiving services for developmental disabilities, randomly sampled from the California birth certificate files (n=159), and frequency matched to autism cases on sex, birth year, and birth month.","conclusion":"The concentration of BDNF in maternal mid-pregnancy and neonatal specimens was similar across all three study groups. These data do not support previous findings of an association between BDNF and autism and suggest that the concentration of BDNF during critical periods of early neurodevelopment is not likely to be a useful biomarker for autism susceptibility."},{"method":"The present study used a 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner to examine the behavioral and neural correlates of real-time motor sequence learning in adolescents and adults with ASD (n = 15) compared with age- and intelligence quotient-matched individuals with typical development (n = 15) during an SRT task.","background":"Motor-linked implicit learning is the learning of a sequence of movements without conscious awareness. Although motor symptoms are frequently reported in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), recent behavioral studies have suggested that motor-linked implicit learning may be intact in ASD. The serial reaction time (SRT) task is one of the most common measures of motor-linked implicit learning.","conclusion":"Behavioral results suggested less robust motor sequence learning in individuals with ASD. Group differences in brain activation suggested that individuals with ASD, relative to individuals with typical development, showed decreased activation in the right superior parietal lobule (SPL) and right precuneus (Brodmann areas 5 and 7, and extending into the intraparietal sulcus) during learning. Activation in these areas (and in areas such as the right putamen and right supramarginal gyrus) was found to be significantly related to behavioral learning in this task. Additionally, individuals with ASD who had more severe repetitive behavior\/restricted interest symptoms demonstrated greater decreased activation in these regions during motor learning. In conjunction, these results suggest that the SPL may play an important role in motor learning and repetitive behavior in individuals with ASD."},{"method":"To address this, we translated four widely used SDT (Social Communication Disorder Checklist, Autism Spectrum Quotient, Social Communication Questionnaire, and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) into Bengali and Hindi, two main regional languages (~ 360 million speakers), and tested their usability in children with and without ASC.","background":"There is a critical need for screening and diagnostic tools (SDT) for autism spectrum conditions (ASC) in regional languages in South Asia.","conclusion":"We found a significant difference in scores between children with ASC (n = 45 in Bengali, n = 40 in Hindi) and typically developing children (n = 43 in Bengali, n = 42 in Hindi) on all SDTs. These results demonstrate that these SDTs are usable in South Asia, and constitute an important resource for epidemiology research and clinical diagnosis in the region."},{"method":"We used an independent groups design with three groups of children (8-10 years old) matched on age and nonverbal IQ: an ASD group, an SLI group, and a typically developing (TD) group. All of the children completed an individually administered, standardized motor assessment battery.","background":"Recent research suggests that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience some level of motor difficulty, and that this may be associated with social communication skills. However, other studies show that children with language impairments, but without the social communication problems, are at risk of motor difficulties as well. The aim of the present study was to determine if children with ASD have syndrome-specific motor deficits in comparison to children with specific language impairment (SLI).","conclusion":"We found that the TD group demonstrated significantly better motor skills than either the ASD or SLI groups. Detailed analyses of the motor subtests revealed that the ASD and SLI groups had very similar motor profiles across a range of fine and gross motor skills, with one exception. We conclude that children with ASD, and SLI, are at risk of clinically significant motor deficits. However, future behavioral and neurological studies of motor skills in children with ASD should include an SLI comparison group in order to identify possible autism-specific deficits."},{"method":"Here, we screened, in prefrontal cortex (PFC) of 15 subjects diagnosed with autism and 15 matched controls the expression of 44 transcripts that are either preferentially expressed in gamma-aminobutyric acidergic interneurons of the mature cortex or important for the development of inhibitory circuitry.","background":"Dysfunction of cerebral cortex in autism is thought to involve alterations in inhibitory neurotransmission.","conclusion":"Significant alterations in the autism cohort included decreased expression (-45%) of RPP25 (15q24.1), which is located within the autism susceptibility locus, 15q22-26. RPP25, which encodes the 25 kDa subunit of ribonuclease P involved in tRNA and pre-ribosomal RNA processing, was developmentally regulated in cerebral cortex with peak levels of expression during late fetal development (human) or around birth (mouse). In the PFC, RPP25 chromatin showed high levels of histone H3-lysine 4 trimethylation, an epigenetic mark associated with transcriptional regulation. Unexpectedly, and in contrast to peripheral tissues, levels of RPP25 protein remained undetectable in fetal and adult cerebral cortex. Taken together, these findings suggest a potential role for the RPP25 gene transcript in the neurobiology of developmental brain disorders."},{"method":"This study tested whether preserved analogical reasoning abilities in ASD can be extended to abstract analogical reasoning, using photographs of real-world items and situations. Abstractness of the analogies was determined via a quantitative measure of semantic distance derived from latent semantic analysis.","background":"Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) exhibit a deficit in spontaneously recognizing abstract similarities that are crucial for generalizing learning to new situations. This may contribute to deficits in the development of appropriate schemas for navigating novel situations, including social interactions. Analogical reasoning is the central cognitive mechanism that enables typically developing children to understand abstract similarities between different situations. Intriguingly, studies of high-functioning children with ASD point to a relative cognitive strength in basic, nonabstract forms of analogical reasoning. If this analogical reasoning ability extends to abstract analogical reasoning (i.e., between superficially dissimilar situations), it may provide a bridge between a cognitive capability and core ASD deficits in areas such as generalization and categorization.","conclusion":"Children with ASD performed as well as typically developing children at identifying abstract analogical similarities when explicitly instructed to apply analogical reasoning. Individual differences in abstract analogical reasoning ability predicted individual differences in a measure of social function in the ASD group. Preliminary analyses indicated that children with ASD, but not typically developing children, showed an effect of age on abstract analogical reasoning. These results provide new evidence that children with ASD are capable of identifying abstract similarities through analogical reasoning, pointing to abstract analogical reasoning as a potential lever for improving generalization skills and social function in ASD."},{"method":"Consecutive frames were presented containing Gabor elements that slightly changed orientation from one frame to the next.

The subjective experience was that of an object appearing out of a fog.","background":"The ability to identify animate and inanimate objects from impoverished images was investigated in adults with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (HFA) and in matched typically developed (TD) adults, using a newly developed task.","conclusion":"The HFA group required significantly more frames to identify the impoverished objects than the TD group. Crucially, this difference depended on the nature of the objects: the HFA group required significantly more frames to identify animate objects, but with respect to the identification of inanimate objects the groups did not differ. The groups also did not differ with respect to the number and type of incorrect guesses they made. The results suggest a specific impairment in individuals with HFA in identifying animate objects. A number of possible explanations are discussed."},{"method":"By employing an atlas-based analysis using large deformation diffeometric morphic mapping registration, a widespread but left-lateralized pattern of abnormalities was revealed. The mean diffusivity (MD) of water in the WM of HF-ASD children was significantly elevated throughout the left hemisphere, particularly in the outer-zone cortical WM. Across diagnostic groups, there was a significant effect of age on left-hemisphere MD, with a similar reduction in MD during childhood in both typically developing and HF-ASD children.","background":"Current theories of the neurobiological basis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) posit an altered pattern of connectivity in large-scale brain networks. Here we used diffusion tensor imaging to investigate the microstructural properties of the white matter (WM) that mediates interregional connectivity in 36 high-functioning children with ASD (HF-ASD) as compared with 37 controls.","conclusion":"The increased MD in children with HF-ASD suggests hypomyelination and may reflect increased short-range cortico-cortical connections subsequent to early WM overgrowth. These findings also highlight left-hemispheric connectivity as relevant to the pathophysiology of ASD and indicate that the spatial distribution of microstructural abnormalities in HF-ASD is widespread and left-lateralized. This altered left-hemispheric connectivity may contribute to deficits in communication and praxis observed in ASD."},{"method":"Using two large UK ASD family databases, we investigated recurrence rates for ASD and evidence for reproductive stoppage for both ASD and undiagnosed ASD\/broader autism phenotype in a subgroup of families. Reproductive stoppage was tested for using the Mann-Whitney U-test to disprove the null hypothesis that affected and nonaffected children were distributed randomly by birth order. Dahlberg's later-sib method was used to estimate recurrence risk and take stoppage into account.","background":"Following a diagnosis of a developmental disorder such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in early childhood, parents may decide to have fewer children than previously planned. The tendency for families to halt reproduction after receiving a diagnosis for one child is known as reproductive stoppage. Stoppage may lead to an underestimate of recurrence risk estimates of parents having more than one child with ASD.","conclusion":"Data were available from 299 families (660 children) including 327 with ASD. Ten percent of the complete families had more than one child with an ASD. Using Dahlberg's later-sib method, the recurrence risk for ASD was 24.7% overall and 50.0% in families with two or more older siblings with ASD. Children with ASD were born significantly later in families than those without ASD in all sibship combinations. This study shows strong evidence that ASD is associated with reproductive stoppage. These data have important implications for family planning and genetic counseling."},{"method":"Even in the relatively brief semi-structured observations, GEE analyses of the severity and prevalence of RRBs differentiated children with ASD from those with NS and TD across all ages.","background":"Restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) observed during the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule [ADOS: Lord et al., 2000] were examined in a longitudinal data set of 455 toddlers and preschoolers (age 8-56 months) with clinical diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD; autism, n=121 and pervasive developmental disorders-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), n=71), a nonspectrum disorder (NS; n=90), or typical development (TD; n=173).","conclusion":"RRB total scores on the ADOS were stable over time for children with ASD and NS; however, typically developing preschoolers showed lower RRB scores than typically developing toddlers. Nonverbal IQ (NVIQ) was more strongly related to the prevalence of RRBs in older children with PDD-NOS, NS, and TD than younger children under 2 years and those with autism. Item analyses revealed different relationships between individual items and NVIQ, age, diagnosis, and gender. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the etiology and treatment of RRBs as well as for the framework of ASD diagnostic criteria in future diagnostic systems."},{"method":"To test the contribution of language history to ASD problem solving, TQT performance was compared in children with high-functioning autism (HFA), children with Asperger syndrome (AS) and TD children.","background":"Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) adopt less efficient strategies than typically developing (TD) peers on the Twenty Questions Task (TQT), a measure of verbal problem-solving skills. Although problems with the TQT are typically associated with executive dysfunction, they have also been reported in children who are deaf, suggesting a role for atypical language development.","conclusion":"The HFA group used significantly less efficient strategies than both AS and TD children. No group differences were evident on tests of question understanding, planning or verbal fluency. Potential explanations for differences in verbal problem-solving skill are discussed with reference to the development of inner speech and use of visual strategies in ASD."},{"method":"We compared 35 children with autism, 27 of their siblings without autism and 25 age- and gender-matched community controls for genomic stability using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-cyt) assay, B vitamins and homocysteine, as well as autism-related behaviours.","background":"Autism spectrum disorders are a set of neurodevelopmental disorders that are highly hereditable. Increased genomic instability has been observed in other heritable paediatric neurobiological disorders; therefore, the aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that DNA damage is increased in children with autism and that B vitamin status may explain variations in genome integrity between autistic and normal children.","conclusion":"It was found that there were no differences in CBMN-cyt biomarkers between the three groups. Vitamin B2 was significantly raised in children with autism and their siblings compared with controls (P = 0.027 and P = 0.016 respectively) but there was no difference in other B vitamins or homocysteine. In conclusion, although replication using a larger cohort is needed, it appears unlikely that genomic instability is a feature of the aetiology of autism. We cannot rule out in utero effects or other types of DNA damage not measured by the CBMN-cyt assay."},{"method":"Twenty high-functioning male adults with ASD and 32 typically developing male adults, matched on age and verbal abilities undertook a battery of auditory tasks. These included affective and pragmatic prosody recognition tasks, two psychoacoustic tasks (pitch direction recognition and pitch discrimination), and a facial emotion recognition task, representing nonvocal emotion recognition.","background":"Prosody is an important tool of human communication, carrying both affective and pragmatic messages in speech. Prosody recognition relies on processing of acoustic cues, such as the fundamental frequency of the voice signal, and their interpretation according to acquired socioemotional scripts. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show deficiencies in affective prosody recognition. These deficiencies have been mostly associated with general difficulties in emotion recognition. The current study explored an additional association between affective prosody recognition in ASD and auditory perceptual abilities.","conclusion":"Compared with controls, the ASD group demonstrated poorer performance on both vocal and facial emotion recognition, but not on pragmatic prosody recognition or on any of the psychoacoustic tasks. Both groups showed strong associations between psychoacoustic abilities and prosody recognition, both affective and pragmatic, although these were more pronounced in the ASD group. Facial emotion recognition predicted vocal emotion recognition in the ASD group only. These findings suggest that auditory perceptual abilities, alongside general emotion recognition abilities, play a significant role in affective prosody recognition in ASD."},{"method":"To test this, we examined the association of genes previously implicated in dyslexia, LI, and\/or language-related traits with language skills in children with ASD. We used genetic and language data collected in the Autism Genome Research Exchange (AGRE) and Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) cohorts to perform a meta-analysis on performance on a receptive vocabulary task.","background":"Language and communication development is a complex process influenced by numerous environmental and genetic factors. Many neurodevelopment disorders include deficits in language and communication skills in their diagnostic criteria, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), language impairment (LI), and dyslexia. These disorders are polygenic and complex with a significant genetic component contributing to each. The similarity of language phenotypes and comorbidity of these disorders suggest that they may share genetic contributors.","conclusion":"There were associations with LI risk gene ATP2C2 and dyslexia risk gene MRPL19. Additionally, we found suggestive evidence of association with CMIP, GCFC2, KIAA0319L, the DYX2 locus (ACOT13, GPLD1, and FAM65B), and DRD2. Our results show that LI and dyslexia genes also contribute to language traits in children with ASD. These associations add to the growing literature of generalist genes that contribute to multiple related neurobehavioral traits. Future studies should examine whether other genetic contributors may be shared among these disorders and how risk variants interact with each other and the environment to modify clinical presentations."},{"method":"Using a passive-listening functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm with spoken words, sung words and piano tones, we found that 22 children with ASD, with varying levels of functioning, activated bilateral temporal brain networks during sung-word perception, similarly to an age and gender-matched control group. In contrast, spoken-word perception was right-lateralized in ASD and elicited reduced inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) activity which varied as a function of language ability. Diffusion tensor imaging analysis reflected reduced integrity of the left hemisphere fronto-temporal tract in the ASD group and further showed that the hypoactivation in IFG was predicted by integrity of this tract.","background":"Co-occurrence of preserved musical function with language and socio-communicative impairments is a common but understudied feature of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Given the significant overlap in neural organization of these processes, investigating brain mechanisms underlying speech and music may not only help dissociate the nature of these auditory processes in ASD but also provide a neurobiological basis for development of interventions.","conclusion":"Subsequent psychophysiological interactions revealed that functional fronto-temporal connectivity, disrupted during spoken-word perception, was preserved during sung-word listening in ASD, suggesting alternate mechanisms of speech and music processing in ASD. Our results thus demonstrate the ability of song to overcome the structural deficit for speech across the autism spectrum and provide a mechanistic basis for efficacy of song-based interventions in ASD."},{"method":"To assess empathic embarrassment accuracy, we compared the level of embarrassment experienced by protagonists to the embarrassment felt by participants while watching the protagonists.","background":"Empathic accuracy refers to the ability of perceivers to accurately share the emotions of protagonists. Using a novel task assessing embarrassment, the current study sought to compare levels of empathic embarrassment accuracy among individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with those of matched controls.","conclusion":"The results show that while the embarrassment ratings of participants and protagonists were highly matched among controls, individuals with ASD failed to exhibit this matching effect. Furthermore, individuals with ASD rated their embarrassment higher than controls when viewing themselves and protagonists on film, but not while performing the task itself. These findings suggest that individuals with ASD tend to have higher ratings of empathic embarrassment, perhaps due to difficulties in emotion regulation that may account for their impaired empathic accuracy and aberrant social behavior."},{"method":"To determine whether there was a relationship between BPA exposure and ASD, urine specimens were collected from 46 children with ASD and 52 controls. Free and total BPA concentrations were determined by mass spectrometry. The fraction glucuronidated was calculated from the difference. A metabolomics study was done to investigate metabolite distribution in the urine.","background":"The etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is believed to involve genetic and environmental components. This study focused on the plasticizer, Bisphenol-A (BPA). The major pathway for BPA metabolism and excretion is via glucuronidation.","conclusion":"(i) Most of the BPA excreted in the urine was as the glucuronide; (ii) about 20% of the ASD children had BPA levels beyond the 90th percentile (&gt;50 ng\/mL) of the frequency distribution for the total sample of 98 children; (iii) Mann-Whitney U tests and multiple regression analyses found significant differences (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) between the groups in total and % bound BPA; and (iv) the metabolomics analyses showed the number of absolute partial correlations &gt;|0.30| between metabolite concentrations and total BPA was &#x223c;3 times greater with the ASD group than the controls (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), and the number of absolute partial correlations&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;|0.30| for % bound BPA was &#x223c;15 times higher with ASD (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The results suggest there is an association between BPA and ASD."},{"method":"In the present study, we examined whether there were differences in how ASD adolescents encoded transitive and intransitive actions compared to typically developing (TD) adolescents, by having participants view videos of a hand reaching across a screen toward an object or to where an object would be while functional magnetic resonance images were collected. Analyses focused on areas within the action observation network (AON), which is activated during the observation of actions performed by others.","background":"Social impairments in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may be in part due to difficulty perceiving and recognizing the actions of others. Evidence from imitation studies, which involves both observation and execution of an action, suggests differences, in individuals with ASD, between the ability to imitate goal-directed actions involving objects (transitive actions) and the ability to imitate actions that do not involve objects (intransitive actions).","conclusion":"We hypothesized that the AON would differentiate transitive from intransitive actions only in the ASD group. However, results revealed that object presence modulated activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus and supramarginal gyrus of the TD group, a differentiation that was not seen in the ASD group. Furthermore, there were no significant group differences between the TD and ASD groups in any of the conditions. This suggests that there is not a global deficit of the AON in individuals with ASD while observing transitive and intransitive actions."},{"method":"This study investigated behavioral and physiological effects of social provocation in patients with ASD and healthy controls. We used a modified Taylor Aggression Paradigm in 24 high-functioning patients with ASD and 24 healthy controls. Participants were instructed to play against a fictitious human opponent. Money withdrawals toward the participant represented provocation and money deduction by the participant denoted aggressive behavior. Throughout the measurement, electrodermal activity (EDA) was recorded.","background":"Deficits in emotion processing and social interaction are prominent symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD has also been associated with aggressive tendencies towards self and others. The prevalence of aggressive behavior in this disorder, its etiology and its impact on social life are still unclear.","conclusion":"Healthy controls showed higher aggressive responses to high provocation compared to low provocation, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the used procedure in eliciting aggression. Patients' responses were not influenced by the level of social provocation, although in both groups aggression was higher after lost compared to won trials. Physiologically, controls showed fewer but higher EDA amplitudes when responding aggressively, whereas patients displayed the opposite pattern of more but lower EDA amplitudes. The modified Taylor Aggression Paradigm successfully elicited aggression and revealed different behavioral and neurophysiological responses in patients and healthy controls. Patients' aggressive behavior as well as their physiological responses were less modulated by level of provocation compared to controls. Therapeutic attempts for patients might concentrate on improving empathic abilities and the understanding of social situations, including provocation and aggressive behavior."},{"method":"We showed participants (individuals with and without high-functioning autism (HFA) aged 8-19) a split-screen video of two identical individuals speaking side by side. Only one of the speakers was in synchrony with the corresponding audio track and synchrony switched between the two speakers every few seconds. Participants were asked to watch the video without further instructions (implicit condition) or to specifically watch the in-synch speaker (explicit condition). We recorded which part of the screen and face their eyes targeted.","background":"Conversation requires integration of information from faces and voices to fully understand the speaker's message. To detect auditory-visual asynchrony of speech, listeners must integrate visual movements of the face, particularly the mouth, with auditory speech information. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder may be less successful at such multisensory integration, despite their demonstrated preference for looking at the mouth region of a speaker.","conclusion":"Both groups looked at the in-synch video significantly more with explicit instructions. However, participants with HFA looked at the in-synch video less than typically developing (TD) peers and did not increase their gaze time as much as TD participants in the explicit task. Importantly, the HFA group looked significantly less at the mouth than their TD peers, and significantly more at non-face regions of the image. There were no between-group differences for eye-directed gaze. Overall, individuals with HFA spend less time looking at the crucially important mouth region of the face during auditory-visual speech integration, which is maladaptive gaze behavior for this type of task."},{"method":"We enrolled 181 subjects divided into four diagnostic groups: ADHD group, ASD group, ASD+ADHD group (that met diagnostic criteria for both ASD and ADHD), and control group. Intelligent quotient (IQ), emotional and behavior problems, ADHD symptoms, ASD symptoms, and adaptive behaviors were investigated through the following test: Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence or Leiter International Performances Scale Revised, Child Behavior Checklist, Conners' Rating Scales-Revised, SNAP-IV Rating Scale, the Social Communication Questionnaire, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales.","background":"Recent studies support several overlapping traits between autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), assuming the existence of a combined phenotype. The aim of our study was to evaluate the common or distinctive clinical features between ASD and ADHD in order to identify possible different phenotypes that could have a clinical value.","conclusion":"The ASD+ADHD group differs from ADHD or ASD in some domains such as lower IQ mean level and a higher autistic symptoms severity. However, the ASD+ADHD group shares inattention and hyperactivity deficit and some emotional and behavior problems with the ADHD group, while it shares adaptive behavior impairment with ASD group. These findings provide a new understanding of clinical manifestation of ASD+ADHD phenotype, they may also inform a novel treatment target."},{"method":"We hypothesized that screening for abnormal levels of urinary CR and GAA in children with ASD may assist in identifying a subgroup of ASD individuals who can be managed with dietary interventions. Morning urine samples were collected from children with and without autism and analyzed for CR and GAA levels.","background":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that presents in the first three years of life. Currently, diagnosis of ASD is based on its behavioural manifestations, as laboratory diagnostic tests do not exist. Creatine deficiency syndrome (CDS) is one form of inborn error of metabolism where affected individuals have similar clinical features to individuals with ASD. Abnormal urinary creatine (CR) and guanidinoacetate (GAA) levels have been reported as biomarkers of CDS.","conclusion":"Results showed there was no statistically significant difference in urinary CR:creatinine and GAA:creatinine between the children with ASD and sibling or unrelated controls. In conclusion, routine screening for abnormal urinary CR and GAA could be considered in ASD diagnostic protocols; however, individuals positive for CDS are likely to be rare in an ASD cohort."},{"method":"In a case-control design, we assessed gating of the P50 and N100 amplitude in 31 ASD children and 39 healthy matched controls (8-12 years) and screened for differences between groups and within the ASD group.","background":"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia are separate disorders, but there is evidence of conversion or comorbid overlap. The objective of this paper was to explore whether deficits in sensory gating, as seen in some schizophrenia patients, can also be found in a group of ASD children compared to neurotypically developed children. An additional aim was to investigate the possibility of subdividing our ASD sample based on these gating deficits.","conclusion":"We did not find disturbances in auditory P50 and N100 filtering in the group of ASD children as a whole, nor did we find abnormal P50 and N100 amplitudes. However, the P50 amplitude to the conditioning stimulus was significantly reduced in the Asperger subgroup compared to healthy controls. In contrast to what is usually reported for patients with schizophrenia, we found no evidence for sensory gating deficits in our group of ASD children taken as a whole. However, reduced P50 amplitude to conditioning stimuli was found in the Asperger group, which is similar to what has been described in some studies in schizophrenia patients. There was a positive correlation between the P50 amplitude of the conditioning stimuli and anxiety score in the pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified group, which indicates a relation between anxiety and sensory registration in this group."},{"method":"This study was the first to investigate gray matter (GM) changes throughout the ASD lifespan, using voxel-based morphometry to determine whether significant differences exist in the GM volumes of a large sample of individuals with ASD compared to age- and IQ-matched typical controls. We examined GM volume across the lifespan in 531 individuals diagnosed with ASD and 571 neurotypical controls, aged 7-64. We compared groups and correlated GM with age and autism severity in the ASD group.","background":"Although it is widely accepted that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involves neuroanatomical abnormalities and atypical neurodevelopmental patterns, there is little consensus regarding the precise pattern of neuroanatomical differences or how these differences relate to autism symptomology. Furthermore, there is limited research related to neuroanatomical correlates of autism symptomology in individuals with ASD and the studies that do exist primarily include small samples.","conclusion":"Findings suggest bilateral decreased GM volume for individuals with ASD in regions extending from the thalamus to the cerebellum, anterior medial temporal lobes, and orbitofrontal regions. Higher autism severity was associated with decreased GM volumes in prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal and temporal regions, and temporal poles. Similar relationships were found between GM volume and age. ASD diagnosis and severity were not associated with increased GM volumes in any region."},{"method":"To evaluate motor procedure learning and performance strategies in both ASD and typically developing (TD) children, we built a virtual pursuit rotor (VPR) task, requiring tracking a moving target on a computer screen using a digitalized pen and tablet. Procedural learning was measured as increased time on target (TT) across blocks of trials on the same day and consolidation was assessed after a 24-hour rest. The program and the experimental setting (evaluated in a first experiment considering two groups of TD children) allowed also measures of continuous time on target (CTT), distance from target (DT) and distance from path (DP), as well as 2D reconstructions of children's trajectories.","background":"Numerous studies have underscored prevalence of motor impairments in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but only few of them have analyzed motor strategies exploited by ASD children when learning a new motor procedure.","conclusion":"Results showed that the VPR was harder for children with ASD than for TD controls matched for chronological age and intelligence quotient, but both groups displayed comparable motor procedure learning (i.e., similarly incremented their TT). However, closer analysis of CTT, DT, and DP as well as 2D trajectories, showed different motor performance strategies in ASD, highlighting difficulties in overall actions planning. Data underscore the need for deeper investigations of motor strategies exploited by children with ASD when learning a new motor procedure."},{"method":"The downstream genes of TBR1 have been identified using microarray and promoter analyses. In this study, we annotated individual genes downstream of TBR1 and investigated any associations with ASDs through extensive literature searches.","background":"T-Brain-1 (TBR1), a causative gene in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), encodes a brain-specific T-box transcription factor. It is therefore possible that TBR1 controls the expression of other autism risk factors.","conclusion":"Of 124 TBR1 target genes, 23 were reported to be associated with ASDs. In addition, one gene, Kiaa0319, is a known causative gene for dyslexia, a disorder frequently associated with autism. A change in expression level in 10 of these 24 genes has been previously confirmed. We further validated the alteration of RNA expression levels of Kiaa0319, Baiap2, and Gad1 in Tbr1 deficient mice. Among these 24 genes, four transcription factors Auts2, Nfia, Nr4a2, and Sox5 were found, suggesting that TBR1 controls a transcriptional cascade relevant to autism pathogenesis. A further five of the 24 genes (Cd44, Cdh8, Cntn6, Gpc6, and Ntng1) encode membrane proteins that regulate cell adhesion and axonal outgrowth. These genes likely contribute to the role of TBR1 in regulation of neuronal migration and axonal extension. Besides, decreases in Grin2b expression and increases in Gad1 expression imply that neuronal activity may be aberrant in Tbr1 deficient mice. These analyses provide direction for future experiments to reveal the pathogenic mechanism of autism."},{"method":"In this study, imitation recognition behaviors for children with ASD and typically developing children were observed during periods of contingent imitation imbedded in a naturalistic imitation task.","background":"Previous work has indicated that both typically developing children and children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) display a range of imitation recognition behaviors in response to a contingent adult imitator. However, it is unknown how the two groups perform comparatively on this construct.","conclusion":"Results from this study indicate that children with ASD are impaired in their ability to recognize being imitated relative to typically developing peers as demonstrated both by behaviors representing basic social attention and more mature imitation recognition. Display of imitation recognition behaviors was independent of length of contingent imitation period in typically developing children, but rate of engagement in imitation recognition behaviors was positively correlated with length of contingent imitation period in children with ASD. Exploratory findings also suggest a link between the ability to demonstrate recognition of being imitated and ASD symptom severity, language, and object imitation for young children with ASD."},{"method":"We developed three BAP measures (informant interview, self-report interview, and impression of interviewee observational scale) and describe the development strategy and findings from the interviews. International Molecular Genetic Study of Autism Consortium data were collected from families containing at least two individuals with autism. Comparison of the informant and self-report interviews was restricted to samples in which the interviews were undertaken by different researchers from that site (251 UK informants, 119 from the Netherlands). Researchers produced vignettes that were rated blind by others. Retest reliability was assessed in 45 participants. Agreement between live scoring and vignette ratings was very high. Retest stability for the interviews was high. Factor analysis indicated a first factor comprising social-communication items and rigidity (but not other repetitive domain items), and a second factor comprised mainly of reading and spelling impairments. Whole scale Cronbach's alphas were high for both interviews. The correlation between interviews for factor 1 was moderate (adult items 0.50; childhood items 0.43); Kappa values for between-interview agreement on individual items were mainly low. The correlations between individual items and total score were moderate.","background":"Clinical genetic studies confirm the broader autism phenotype (BAP) in some relatives of individuals with autism, but there are few standardized assessment measures.","conclusion":"The inclusion of several factor 2 items lowered the overall Cronbach's alpha for the total set. Both interview measures showed good reliability and substantial stability over time, but the findings were better for factor 1 than factor 2. We recommend factor 1 scores be used for characterising the BAP."},{"method":"We conducted series of in vivo tests on 15- to 19- week old male mice, heterozygous for the TCF4 functional deletion, mimicking the TCF4 haploinsufficiency in PTHS patients, and their wild type littermates. Data collection and initial analysis were performed blindly, that is, the genotyping key was received after the mean values were calculated for each individual animal, and then mean\/median of each group was subsequently calculated.","background":"Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, classified as an autism spectrum disorder that is caused by the haploinsufficiency of Transcription Factor 4 (TCF4). The most common non-neurological symptoms in PTHS patients are gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, mainly gastroesophageal reflux and severe constipation (in about 30 and 75% of PTHS patients, respectively). We hypothesized that the recently recognized mouse model of PTHS will exhibit problems with their gut function.","conclusion":"Body weight, fecal pellet output, and fluid content were similar between the groups, indicating normal gross growth of PTHS mice and their overall physiological GI motility and intestinal secretion\/absorption. There were no significant differences in gut length and gross appearance pointing out that PTHS mice have normal gut in gross anatomical terms. However, the assessment of gut transit indicates that, while whole-gut transit velocity was similar between the groups, the upper GI and distal colon transit velocities were significantly reduced in the PTHS mice. This is the first evidence of specific gut related problems in the PTHS mice. Our study also validates the TCF4 functional knockout mice as an animal model to study PTHS-associated GI disturbances."},{"method":"To explore these possibilities, 17 adolescents and adults with ASD and 17 neurotypical controls viewed 21 videos and pictures of peoples' emotional responses to gifts (chocolate, a handmade novelty or Monopoly money), then inferred what gift the person received and the emotion expressed by the person while eye movements were measured.","background":"Recent research has shown that adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have difficulty interpreting others' emotional responses, in order to work out what actually happened to them. It is unclear what underlies this difficulty; important cues may be missed from fast paced dynamic stimuli, or spontaneous emotional responses may be too complex for those with ASD to successfully recognise.","conclusion":"Participants with ASD were significantly more accurate at distinguishing who received a chocolate or homemade gift from static (compared to dynamic) stimuli, but significantly less accurate when inferring who received Monopoly money from static (compared to dynamic) stimuli. Both groups made similar emotion attributions to each gift in both conditions (positive for chocolate, feigned positive for homemade and confused for Monopoly money). Participants with ASD only made marginally significantly fewer fixations to the eyes of the face, and face of the person than typical controls in both conditions. Results suggest adolescents and adults with ASD can distinguish subtle emotion cues for certain emotions (genuine from feigned positive) when given sufficient processing time, however, dynamic cues are informative for recognising emotion blends (e.g., smiling in confusion). This indicates difficulties processing complex emotion responses in ASD."},{"method":"Similarly, in the current study, we found several anatomical differences in the patDp\/+ mice that were not seen in the matDp\/+ mice. Regional differences that are evident only in the paternal duplication are a smaller dentate gyrus and smaller medial striatum.","background":"Paternally and maternally inherited deletions and duplications of human chromosome 15q11-13 are relatively common in the human population. Furthermore, duplications in the 15q region are often associated with autism. Both maternal and paternal interstitial 15q11-13 duplication mouse models have been previously created, where several behavioral differences were found in the paternal duplication (patDp\/+) mouse but not in the maternal duplication (matDp\/+). These included decreased sociability, behavioral inflexibility, abnormal ultrasonic vocalizations, decreased spontaneous activity, and increased anxiety.","conclusion":"These differences may be responsible for the behavioral inflexibility. Furthermore, a smaller dorsal raphe nucleus could be responsible for the reported serotonin defects. This study highlights consistency that can be found between behavioral and anatomical phenotyping."},{"method":"We designed an experiment in which each musical stimulus served as its own control while we varied the emotional expressivity by manipulating timing and amplitude variation. We asked children and adolescents with ASD and matched controls as well as individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) to rate how emotional these excerpts sounded.","background":"Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are impaired in understanding the emotional undertones of speech, many of which are communicated through prosody. Musical performance also employs a form of prosody to communicate emotion, and the goal of this study was to examine the ability of adolescents with ASD to understand musical emotion.","conclusion":"Results show that children and adolescents with ASD are impaired relative to matched controls and individuals with WS at judging the difference in emotionality among the expressivity levels. Implications for theories of emotion in autism are discussed in light of these findings."},{"method":"In this study, we aimed to compare associations between surface-based regional brain measures and general intelligence (IQ) scores in ASD individuals with and without a history of language delay. We included 64 ASD adults of normal intelligence (37 without a history of language delay and 27 with a history of language delay and 80 neurotypicals). Regions with a significant association between verbal and nonverbal IQ and measures of cortical thickness (CT), surface area, and cortical volume were first identified in the combined sample of individuals with ASD and controls.","background":"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of conditions that show abnormalities in the neuroanatomy of multiple brain regions. The variability in the development of intelligence and language among individuals on the autism spectrum has long been acknowledged, but it remains unknown whether these differences impact on the neuropathology of ASD.","conclusion":"Thicker dorsal frontal and temporal cortices, and thinner lateral orbital frontal and parieto-occipital cortices were associated with greater and lower verbal IQ scores, respectively. Correlations between cortical volume and verbal IQ were observed in similar regions as revealed by the CT analysis. A significant difference between ASD individuals with and without a history of language delay in the association between CT and verbal IQ was evident in the parieto-occipital region. These results indicate that ASD subgroups defined on the basis of differential language trajectories in childhood can have different associations between verbal IQ and brain measures in adulthood despite achieving similar levels of cognitive performance."},{"method":"This study examined asthma and allergies in association with ASD and phenotypic subsets. Participants were 560 children with confirmed ASD and 391 typically developing children from the CHildhood Autism Risks from Genetics and the Environment study. Maternally reported child asthma and allergy was compared between cases and controls, and in association with cognitive and behavioral test scores.","background":"Immune aberrations are often noted in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but whether asthma and allergy are related to ASD is not well defined.","conclusion":"Prevalence of asthma and overall allergies did not differ between cases and controls, but overall allergy in children with ASD was associated with higher stereotypy scores as measured by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist. In addition, reported food allergies were significantly associated with ASD (adjusted odds ratio = 2.23, 95% confidence interval 1.28, 3.89). Our results suggest food allergies and sensitivities may be more common in children with ASD, and that these issues may correlate with other behaviors."},{"method":"Here we carried out an extended association analysis of three microsatellites and 12 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in and around the AVPR1A gene in 205 Finnish families followed by promoter analysis. FBAT version v2.0.3 was used for family-based genetic association analyses of AVPR1A microsatellites and SNPs.","background":"The arginine vasopressin receptor 1A gene (AVPR1A) is known to affect social communication and has been reported to associate with autism in several studies. Given that the microsatellite RS1 and a few SNPs in the promoter region of the AVPR1A have repeatedly associated with several traits, including autism it is rather surprising that the molecular explanation for these associations has remained unknown, although it has been reported that the allele length of the AVPR1A microsatellites might affect disease risk.","conclusion":"The nearby microsatellite RS1 was found to harbor the best association. Interestingly, there are two potentially relevant transcription factor (TF) binding sites at RS1: for MEF2C and PBX, predicted with the Match algorithm in the TRANSFAC database. Sequence variations changing the affinity of these TFs might partly explain the AVPR1A promoter region associations shown in autism."},{"method":"Using a sample of 2,509 probands with ASD from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC), this study provides the first replication of the ADOS domain CSS in an independent sample. Consistent with the original standardization study, when applied to existing SSC data, the ADOS domain CSS were less influenced by age and cognitive ability compared to raw domain totals. Domain CSS were also relatively independent of behavior problems.","background":"Raw totals from diagnostic and screening measures for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are frequently used as dimensional measures of autism symptom severity without appropriate correction for confounding factors, such as developmental level or non-ASD-specific behavior problems. Although these associated features are important to consider when diagnosing ASD and developing intervention plans, both researchers and clinicians sometimes need metrics of ASD severity that are not influenced by these factors. The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) domain calibrated severity scores (CSS) were created to provide separate estimates of social affect (SA-CSS) and restricted, repetitive behaviors (RRB-CSS) that are relatively independent of child characteristics (Hus et al., 2014).","conclusion":"Use of the ADOS domain CSS to assess relationships between ASD symptoms and genetic risk factors will increase confidence that associations reflect domain-specific relationships. Scores also offer less developmentally-influenced estimates of ASD severity for future phenotypic explorations in the SSC. This independent replication provides support for the application of the ADOS domain CSS in other samples, though further replication in population-based samples will be an important next step."},{"method":"Here, we report a meta-analysis of more than 1000 microarrays across twelve independent studies on expression changes in ASD compared to unaffected individuals, in both blood and brain tissues.","background":"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are clinically heterogeneous and biologically complex. In general it remains unclear, what biological factors lead to changes in the brains of autistic individuals. A considerable number of transcriptome analyses have been performed in attempts to address this question, but their findings lack a clear consensus. As a result, each of these individual studies has not led to any significant advance in understanding the autistic phenotype as a whole.","conclusion":"We identified a number of known and novel genes that are consistently differentially expressed across three studies of the brain (71 samples in total). A subset of the highly ranked genes is suggestive of effects on mitochondrial function. In blood, consistent changes were more difficult to identify, despite individual studies tending to exhibit larger effects than the brain studies. Our results are the strongest evidence to date of a common transcriptome signature in the brains of individuals with ASD."},{"method":"Participants were asked to study pictures of rooms and pictures of daily objects for which locations were highlighted in the rooms. Participants were later tested for their memory of the object locations either by being asked to place objects back into their original locations or into new locations. Proportions of times when participants choose the previously studied locations for the objects irrespective of the instruction were used to derive indices of explicit and implicit memory [process-dissociation procedure, Jacoby, 1991, 1998]. In addition, participants performed object and location recognition and source memory tasks where they were asked about which locations belonged to the objects and which objects to the locations.","background":"This study tested implicit and explicit spatial relational memory in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).","conclusion":"The data revealed difficulty for ASD individuals in actively retrieving object locations (explicit memory) but not in subconsciously remembering them (implicit memory). These difficulties cannot be explained by difficulties in memory for objects or locations per se (i.e., the difficulty pertains to object-location relations). Together these observations lend further support to the idea that ASD is characterised by relatively circumscribed difficulties in relational rather than item-specific memory processes and show that these difficulties extend to the domain of spatial information. They also lend further support to the idea that memory difficulties in ASD can be reduced when support is provided at test."},{"method":"Prototype learning and memory were examined in a group of high-functioning autistic boys and young men, using a classic paradigm in which participants learned to classify novel dot patterns into one of two categories. Participants were trained on distorted versions of category prototypes until they reached a criterion level of performance. During transfer testing, participants were shown the training items together with three novel stimulus sets manifesting variable levels of physical distortion (low, medium, or high distortion) relative to the unseen prototypes. Two experiments were conducted, differing only in the manner in which the physical distortions were defined.","background":"An ongoing debate in developmental cognitive neuroscience is whether individuals with autism are able to learn prototypical category representations from multiple exemplars.","conclusion":"In the first experiment, a subset of autistic individuals learned categories more slowly than controls, accompanied by an overall diminution in transfer-testing performance. The autism group did, however, manifest a typical pattern of performance across the testing conditions, relative to controls. In the second experiment, group means did not differ statistically in either the training or testing phases. Taken together, these data indicate that high-functioning autistic individuals do not manifest gross deficits in prototypical category learning. A theoretical discussion is given in terms of how perceptual grouping may interact with category learning."},{"method":"To investigate the role of glial cells in ASD, a combination of protein and gene expression analyses were used to determine levels of two glial markers, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), in the postmortem brain tissue from control and ASD donors.","background":"Based on evidence of abnormalities in axon thickness and neuronal disorganization, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is commonly considered to be a condition resulting from neuronal dysfunction. Yet, recent findings suggest that non-neuronal cell types also contribute to ASD pathology.","conclusion":"Levels of GFAP immunoreactivity (ir) were significantly elevated (P = 0.008) in anterior cingulate cortex (Brodmann area 24; BA24) white matter of ASD donors compared to control donors. In contrast, GFAP-ir levels were similar in BA24 gray matter from ASD and control donors. MOG-ir was also similar in both BA24 white and gray matter from ASD and control donors. In anterior prefrontal cortex (BA10), there were no significant differences in GFAP-ir or MOG-ir in either white or gray matter comparing ASD to control donors. Levels of expression of the genes GFAP and MOG also showed no differences between control and ASD donors in BA24 and BA10 white and gray matter. Collectively, these data imply that ASD is associated with an activation of white matter astrocytes in the anterior cingulate cortex as a result of a yet undefined cellular insult. Research is needed to investigate the molecular pathways that underlie this astrocyte reaction and such research may yield important clues regarding the etiology of ASD."},{"method":"Here, we compared perceptual and motor performance between 30 typically developing and AS individuals (21 with speech delay and 18 without speech delay) to examine the associations between limb movement control and atypical speech development.

We used analysis of covariance to investigate group differences in task performance and linear regression models to explore potential associations between intelligence, language skills, simple reaction time, and visually guided movement performance.","background":"Movement atypicalities in speed, coordination, posture, and gait have been observed across the autism spectrum (AS) and atypicalities in coordination are more commonly observed in AS individuals without delayed speech (DSM-IV Asperger) than in those with atypical or delayed speech onset. However, few studies have provided quantitative data to support these mostly clinical observations.","conclusion":"AS participants without speech delay performed slower than typical participants in the Purdue Pegboard subtests. AS participants without speech delay showed poorer bimanual coordination than those with speech delay. Visual processing speed was slightly faster in both AS groups than in the typical group. Altogether, these results suggest that AS individuals with and without speech delay differ in visually guided and visually triggered behavior and show that early language skills are associated with slower movement in simple and complex motor tasks."},{"method":"The current study recruited adolescents and young adults with ASD (aged 15-26 years) and age-matched typically developing (TD) controls (aged 14-25 years). The cortical thickness (CT) and microstructural integrity of the tracts connecting the regions forming the classical MNS were investigated. High-resolution T1-weighted imaging and diffusion spectrum imaging were performed to quantify the CT and tract integrity, respectively.","background":"Previous studies using neural activity recording and neuroimaging techniques have reported functional deficits in the mirror neuron system (MNS) for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, a few studies focusing on gray and white matter structures of the MNS have yielded inconsistent results.","conclusion":"The structural covariance of the CT of the MNS regions revealed a weaker coordination of the MNS network in ASD. A strong correlation was found between the integrity of the right frontoparietal tracts and the social communication subscores measured by the Chinese version of the Social Communication Questionnaire. The results showed that there were no significant mean differences in the CTs and tract integrity between the ASD and TD groups, but revealed a moderate or even reverse age effect on the frontal MNS structures in ASD. In conclusion, aberrant structural coordination may be an underlying factor affecting the function of the MNS in ASD patients. The association between the right frontoparietal tracts and social communication performance implies a neural correlate of communication processing in the autistic brain. This study provides evidence of abnormal MNS structures and their influence on social communication in individuals with ASD."},{"method":"Adults with a diagnosed ASD (n = 74; 36 males, 38 females) were compared to a control group (n = 228; 53 males, 174 females, 1 unspecified) in their self-reported perceptions of body awareness utilizing the Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ) and thirst awareness using the Thirst Awareness Scale (TAS).","background":"This study aimed to investigate the current gap in the literature with regard to how adults with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) interpret elements of the interoceptive sense, which includes thirst, hunger, temperature, satiety, and the prediction of onset of illness.","conclusion":"Those in the ASD group reported a clinically significant lower body and thirst awareness compared to the control group, and this was a large effect (BAQ; d = -1.26, P &lt; 0.001; TAS; d = -1.02, P &lt; 0.001). These findings are of clinical importance, as difficulty with sensing internal bodily states could theoretically impact on the physical and mental health, social interactions and self-awareness of adults with ASD."},{"method":"Participants included 101 mothers of adolescents and young adults diagnosed with ASD. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between bullying victimization and anxiety in children with ASD, as well as parenting stress as a potential moderator of that relationship.","background":"Bullying victimization is commonly associated with anxiety among individuals with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and both bullying victimization and anxiety are more prevalent among youth with ASD than in the general population. We explored individual and contextual factors that relate to anxiety in adolescents and young adults with ASD who also experience bullying victimization.","conclusion":"Findings indicate that parenting stress moderates the association between bullying victimization and anxiety. The severity of anxiety was most strongly associated with bullying victimization when mothers reported high levels of stress. Implications for interventions that assist parents with coping and address bullying victimization are discussed."},{"method":"The trial protocol is registered at www.trialregister.nl, trial number 2327 and published before the data collection was finished (www.trialsjournal.com). Children with autism aged 7-12 years (n = 97) were randomized over a waitlist control or a treatment condition. Outcome measures included ToM and emotion understanding, parent and teacher questionnaires on children's social skills, ToM-related social behavior, and autistic traits. Six-month follow-up parent reported data were collected for the treatment group.","background":"Limited perspective taking or \"Theory of Mind\" (ToM) abilities are a core deficit of autism, and many interventions are aimed to improve ToM abilities. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of a ToM treatment for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and, for the first time, the moderating roles of social interaction style (SIS) and disruptive behavior (DB), to determine which children are most likely to respond to this intervention.","conclusion":"The treatment had a positive effect on ToM understanding, parent-reported ToM behavior, and autistic traits, but not on parent or teacher-reported social behavior. Passive SIS was associated with diminished treatment effects on autistic traits, but DB was unrelated to outcomes. The ToM intervention improved conceptual social understanding and ToM-related behavior of children with ASD. However, broader application of learned skills to other domains of functioning was limited. Individual differences with regard to treatment response are discussed."},{"method":"We recorded the eye movements of typically developing (TD) adults ASD adults when they read statements that could either be interpreted as ironic or non-ironic depending on the context of the passage.","background":"Previous research has suggested that individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have difficulties understanding others communicative intent and with using contextual information to correctly interpret irony.","conclusion":"Participants with ASD performed as well as TD controls in their comprehension accuracy for speaker's statements in both ironic and non-ironic conditions. Eye movement data showed that for both participant groups, total reading times were longer for the critical region containing the speaker's statement and a subsequent sentence restating the context in the ironic condition compared to the non-ironic condition. The results suggest that more effortful processing is required in both ASD and TD participants for ironic compared with literal non-ironic statements, and that individuals with ASD were able to use contextual information to infer a non-literal interpretation of ironic text. Individuals with ASD, however, spent more time overall than TD controls rereading the passages, to a similar degree across both ironic and non-ironic conditions, suggesting that they either take longer to construct a coherent discourse representation of the text, or that they take longer to make the decision that their representation of the text is reasonable based on their knowledge of the world."},{"method":"This study examined self-perceptions of adolescents with ASD (n = 19) and typically developing (TD) mental-age-matched controls (n = 22) using actual performance on objective academic tasks as the basis for ratings.

After completing each task, they were asked how well they thought they did (immediate post-performance) and how well they would do in the future (hypothetical future post-performance).","background":"Research has demonstrated that, despite difficulties in multiple domains, children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show a lack of awareness of these difficulties. A misunderstanding of poor competencies may make it difficult for individuals to adjust their behaviour in accordance with feedback and may lead to greater impairments over time.","conclusion":"Adolescents with ASD had more positively biased self-perceptions of competence than TD controls. The ASD group tended to overestimate their performance on all ratings of self-perceptions (pre-task prediction, immediate, and hypothetical future post-performance). In contrast, while the TD group was quite accurate at estimating their performance immediately before and after performing the task, they showed some tendency to overestimate their future performance. Future investigation is needed to systematically examine possible mechanisms that may be contributing to these biased self-perceptions."},{"method":"Medical history data were queried in the multiplex family Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE). Fourteen medical conditions were analyzed. Replication in the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) was attempted using available medical condition data on gastrointestinal disturbances (GID), sleep problems, allergy and epilepsy.","background":"Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may present with multiple medical conditions in addition to ASD symptoms. This study investigated whether there are predictive patterns of medical conditions that co-occur with ASD, which could inform medical evaluation and treatment in ASD, as well as potentially identify etiologically meaningful subgroups.","conclusion":"In the AGRE cohort, no discrete clusters emerged among 14 medical conditions. GID and seizures were enriched in unaffected family members, and together with sleep problems, were represented in both AGRE and SSC. Further analysis of these medical conditions identified predictive co-occurring patterns in both samples. For a child with ASD, the presence of GID predicts sleep problems and vice versa, with an approximately 2-fold odds ratio in each direction. These risk patterns were replicated in the SSC sample, and in addition, there was increased risk for seizures and sleep problems to co-occur with GID. In these cohorts, seizure alone was not predictive of the other conditions co-occurring, but behavioral impairments were more severe as the number of co-occurring medical symptoms increased. These findings indicate that interdisciplinary clinical care for children with ASD will benefit from evaluation for specific patterns of medical conditions in the affected child and their family members."},{"method":"Here, we investigated how regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measure of similarity of a voxel's timeseries to its nearest neighbors, varies across age in individuals with ASD and typically developing (TD) individuals using a cross-sectional design. Resting-state fMRI data obtained from a publicly available database were analyzed to determine group differences in ReHo between three age cohorts: children, adolescents, and adults.","background":"There is a general consensus that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is accompanied by alterations in brain connectivity. Much of the neuroimaging work has focused on assessing long-range connectivity disruptions in ASD. However, evidence from both animal models and postmortem examination of the human brain suggests that local connections may also be disrupted in individuals with the disorder.","conclusion":"In typical development, ReHo across the entire brain was higher in children than in adolescents and adults. In contrast, children with ASD exhibited marginally lower ReHo than TD children, while adolescents and adults with ASD exhibited similar levels of local connectivity as age-matched neurotypical individuals. During all developmental stages, individuals with ASD exhibited lower local connectivity in sensory processing brain regions and higher local connectivity in complex information processing regions. Further, higher local connectivity in ASD corresponded to more severe ASD symptomatology. These results demonstrate that local connectivity is disrupted in ASD across development, with the most pronounced differences occurring in childhood. Developmental changes in ReHo do not mirror findings from fMRI studies of long-range connectivity in ASD, pointing to a need for more nuanced accounts of brain connectivity alterations in the disorder."},{"method":"Participants with ASD (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;60) and typically developing peers (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;16) aged 5-18 years underwent a comprehensive audiological screening (pure tone audiometry, uncomfortable loudness level, tympanometry, acoustic reflexes, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, and auditory brainstem response) and assessment of communication abilities (expressive\/receptive language, articulation, phonological awareness, and vocal affect recognition).","background":"Rates of hearing impairment in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are higher than those reported in the general population. Although ASD is not caused by hearing impairment, it may exacerbate symptomatology.","conclusion":"Incidence of abnormal findings on at least one measure of audiological functioning was higher for the ASD group (55%) than controls (14.9%) or the general population estimate (6%). The presence of sound sensitivity was also considerably higher for the ASD group (37%) compared with controls (0%) or general population estimates (8-15%). When participants with ASD were dichotomized into groups with and without evidence of clinical audiological abnormality, no significant differences were identified on measures of communication; however, results of correlational analyses indicated that variability in hearing thresholds at middle range frequencies (2000 Hz) was significantly related to performance on all measures of speech articulation and language after correction for multiple comparisons (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.48 to r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.53, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009; 0.0045). These findings suggest that dichotomized classification of clinical audiology may not be sufficient to understand the role of subclinical hearing loss in ASD symptomatology and that treatment studies for mild\/subclinical hearing loss in this population may be worthwhile."},{"method":"In the present study, we examined the brain activation and functional connectivity differences underlying explicit and implicit emotional processing in age- and IQ-matched adults with (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;17) and without (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15) ASD.","background":"Interpreting emotional expressions appropriately poses a challenge for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In particular, difficulties with emotional processing in ASD are more pronounced in contexts where emotional expressions are subtle, automatic, and reflexive-that is, implicit. In contrast, explicit emotional processing, which requires the cognitive evaluation of an emotional experience, appears to be relatively intact in individuals with ASD.","conclusion":"Results indicated: (1) significantly reduced levels of brain activation in participants with ASD in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) during implicit emotion processing; (2) significantly weaker functional connectivity in the ASD group in connections of the MPFC with the amygdala, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and fusiform gyrus; (3) No group difference in performance accuracy or reaction time; and (4) Significant positive relationship between empathizing ability and STG activity in ASD but not in typically developing participants. These findings suggest that the neural mechanisms underlying implicit, but not explicit, emotion processing may be altered at multiple levels in individuals with ASD."},{"method":"Participants included 126 school-age children: 30 had ASD only, 33 had ASD with ADHD, and 63 were typically developing. High resolution 3T MPRAGE images were acquired to examine the cortical morphology (gray matter volume, GMV, surface area, SA, and cortical thickness, CT) in three regions of interest (ROI): precentral gyrus (M1), postcentral gyrus (S1), and inferior parietal cortex (IPC).","background":"This study examined the morphology of frontal-parietal regions relevant to motor functions in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with or without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We also explored its associations with autism severity and motor skills, and the impact of comorbid ADHD on these associations.","conclusion":"Children with ASD showed abnormal increases in GMV and SA in all three ROIs: (a) increased GMV in S1 bilaterally and in right M1 was specific to children with ASD without ADHD; (b) all children with ASD (with or without ADHD) showed increases in the left IPC SA. Furthermore, on measures of motor function, impaired praxis was associated with increased GMV in right S1 in the ASD group with ADHD. Children with ASD with ADHD showed a positive relationship between bilateral S1 GMV and manual dexterity, whereas children with ASD without ADHD showed a negative relationship. Our findings suggest that (a) ASD is associated with abnormal morphology of cortical circuits crucial to motor control and learning; (b) anomalous overgrowth of these regions, particularly S1, may contribute to impaired motor skill development, and (c) functional and morphological differences are apparent between children with ASD with or without ADHD."},{"method":"To examine the neural basis of this limitation, adults with and without high functioning autism rapidly enumerated 1 to 8 randomly located squares during a neuroimaging study. Typically, adults are thought to use parallel visual processes to quantify up to three or four elements, and serial processes to enumerate more (5+) elements. We hypothesized that parietal lobe regions associated with counting would be recruited with smaller sets of elements in adults with autism, compared to TD adults.","background":"Previous work indicates that adults with autism display a decreased capacity when rapidly enumerating small sets of elements (i.e., subitizing), compared to typically developing (TD) individuals. This ability is crucial for fundamental visual functions such as object individuation and parallel processing. Thus, the deficit in autism suggests limits in these skills.","conclusion":"Consistent with this hypothesis, activation in parietal regions increased with smaller set sizes in adults with autism compared to TD adults. Increased activation for three elements was evident in several regions, including those thought to underlie subitizing. In addition, regions specific to the counting range in TD adults were often equally active for set sizes in the subitizing range in the adults with autism. Finally, significant deactivation was evident in TD adults, presumably reflecting relative suppression of regions specialized for competing processes, but was not apparent in adults with autism. These differences in brain function in adults with autism on a simple enumeration task suggest atypical brain organization and function that is likely to impact most visual tasks, especially those with multiple elements."},{"method":"The current study examined VPT in 30 children with autism and 30 verbal mental age matched typical children, in comparison to mental rotation (MR) abilities and body representation abilities. Using a similar paradigm to Hamilton, Brindley, and Frith [2009] all children completed three tasks: a VPT task in which children decided what a toy on a table would look like from a different points of view; a MR task in which the child decided what a toy would look like after it had been rotated; and a body posture matching task, in which children matched pictures of a body shown from different viewpoints.","background":"Previous research has suggested that people with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) may have difficulty with visual perspective taking (VPT) but it is not clear how this relates to different strategies that can be used in perspective taking tasks.","conclusion":"Results showed that children with ASC performed better than the typically developing children on the MR task, and at a similar level on the VPT task and body matching task. Importantly, in the typical children VPT performance was predicted by performance on the body matching task, whereas in the ASC children VPT performance was predicted by MR ability. These findings suggest that differences in VPT in ASC may be explained by the use of a spatial rotation strategy rather than the embodied egocentric transformation strategy used by typical children."},{"method":"This study used a translational neuroimaging approach to test the role of a visual imagery-based reading intervention in improving the brain circuitry underlying language processing in children with ASD. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in a longitudinal study design, was used to investigate intervention-related change in sentence comprehension, brain activation, and functional connectivity in three groups of participants (age 8-13 years): an experimental group of ASD children (ASD-EXP), a wait-list control group of ASD children (ASD-WLC), and a group of typically developing control children.","background":"Deficits in language comprehension have been widely reported in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), with behavioral and neuroimaging studies finding increased reliance on visuospatial processing to aid in language comprehension. However, no study to date, has taken advantage of this strength in visuospatial processing to improve language comprehension difficulties in ASD.","conclusion":"After intervention, the ASD-EXP group showed significant increase in activity in visual and language areas and right-hemisphere language area homologues, putamen, and thalamus, suggestive of compensatory routes to increase proficiency in reading comprehension. Additionally, ASD children who had the most improvement in reading comprehension after intervention showed greater functional connectivity between left-hemisphere language areas, the middle temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus while reading high imagery sentences. Thus, the findings of this study, which support the principles of dual coding theory [Paivio 2007], suggest the potential of a strength-based reading intervention in changing brain responses and facilitating better reading comprehension in ASD children."},{"method":"Overall, 269 parents participated; 94 parents of typically developing adolescents, 93 parents of adolescents diagnosed with Ds, and 82 parents of adolescents diagnosed with ASD.

Because of this, we decided to investigate sexuality in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Down's syndrome (Ds) and to compare them with typically developing adolescents, by surveying their parents. Specifically, it was hypothesized that young people with ASD would display lower levels over five domains: social behavior, privacy, sex education, sexual behavior, and parental concerns, than peers with Ds and typically developing young people. In addition, we sought to verify developmental trends in five domains with age for each group.","conclusion":"It was found that three groups were significantly different on all five domains, adolescents with ASD reportedly displaying lower levels than other groups. Moreover, there was a significant improvement in knowledge of privacy and parental concerns with age for adolescents with ASD and a decline in sex education for adolescents with Ds. The results obtained emphasize the need to train adolescents with developmental disability, and especially for adolescents with ASD through sex education programs."},{"method":"Here, we report findings from a psychophysical experiment that explored differences in tactile perception between individuals with autism and typically developing control participants, who, using their index finger, rated a series of surfaces on the extent of their roughness. Each surface was rated multiple times and we calculated both the average rating and the variability across trials.","background":"Although sensory problems, including tactile hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity (DSM-5) are commonly associated with autism, there is a dearth of systematic and rigorous research in this domain.","conclusion":"Relative to controls, the individuals with autism perceived the surfaces as rougher overall and exhibited greater variability in their ratings across trials. These findings characterize altered tactile perception in autism and suggest that sensory problems in autism may be the product of overly responsive and variable sensory processing."},{"method":"In the current study, children with ASD and matched controls judged which member of a pair of faces displayed the more intense emotion. Both faces showed anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness or surprise but to different degrees. Faces were presented on a monitor that was tinted either gray or with a color previously selected by the participant individually as improving the clarity of text.","background":"Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often show atypical processing of facial expressions, which may result from visual stress.","conclusion":"Judgments of emotional intensity improved significantly with the addition of the preferred colored tint in the ASD group but not in controls, a result consistent with a link between visual stress and impairments in processing facial expressions in individuals with ASD."},{"method":"This study investigated NT and ASD participants' ability to recognize emotional expressions produced by NT and ASD posers. Three posing conditions were included, to determine whether potential group differences are due to atypical cognitive representations of emotion, impaired understanding of the communicative value of expressions, or poor proprioceptive feedback.","background":"The difficulties encountered by individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) when interacting with neurotypical (NT, i.e. nonautistic) individuals are usually attributed to failure to recognize the emotions and mental states of their NT interaction partner. It is also possible, however, that at least some of the difficulty is due to a failure of NT individuals to read the mental and emotional states of ASD interaction partners. Previous research has frequently observed deficits of typical facial emotion recognition in individuals with ASD, suggesting atypical representations of emotional expressions. Relatively little research, however, has investigated the ability of individuals with ASD to produce recognizable emotional expressions, and thus, whether NT individuals can recognize autistic emotional expressions. The few studies which have investigated this have used only NT observers, making it impossible to determine whether atypical representations are shared among individuals with ASD, or idiosyncratic.","conclusion":"Results indicated that ASD expressions were recognized less well than NT expressions, and that this is likely due to a genuine deficit in the representation of typical emotional expressions in this population. Further, ASD expressions were equally poorly recognized by NT individuals and those with ASD, implicating idiosyncratic, rather than common, atypical representations of emotional expressions in ASD."},{"method":"The Childhood Embedded Figures Test (CEFT) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) were administered in 87 children with ASD at the age of 6-12 years old (T1), and the ADOS was readministered 7 years later when the participants were 12-19 years old (T2). Linear regression analyses were performed to investigate whether accuracy and reaction time in the complex versus simple CEFT condition and performance in the complex condition predicted T2 ADOS RRBI calibrated severity scores (CSS), while taking into consideration relevant covariates and ADOS RRBI CSS at T1.","background":"Previous research suggests that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show a detail-focused cognitive style. The aim of the current longitudinal study was to investigate whether this detail-focused cognitive style in childhood predicted a higher symptom severity of repetitive and restrictive behaviors and interests (RRBI) in adolescence.","conclusion":"The CEFT performance (accuracy in the complex condition divided by the time needed) significantly predicted higher ADOS RRBI CSS at T2 (&#x394;R(2) &#x2009;=&#x2009;15%).

Discriminative validity of CBCL profiles proposed for ASD screening was examined with area under the curve (AUC) scores, sensitivity, and specificity.","background":"The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) has been proposed for screening of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in clinical settings. Given the already widespread use of the CBCL, this could have great implications for clinical practice. This study examined the utility of CBCL profiles in differentiating children with ASD from children with other clinical disorders.","conclusion":"The CBCL profiles showed low discriminative accuracy for ASD (AUC 0.59-0.70). Meeting cutoffs proposed for ASD was associated with general emotional\/behavioral problems (EBP; mood problems\/aggressive behavior), both in children with and without ASD. Cutoff adjustment depending on EBP-level was associated with improved discriminative accuracy for school-age children. However, the rate of false positives remained high in children with clinical levels of EBP. The results indicate that use of the CBCL profiles for ASD-specific screening would likely result in a large number of misclassifications. Although taking EBP-level into account was associated with improved discriminative accuracy for ASD, acceptable specificity could only be achieved for school-age children with below clinical levels of EBP.

We aimed to investigate the efficiency of cognitive control in sequential information processing, cognitive control of nonsequential information processing across a range of cognitive loads and cognitive control capacity under time constraint.","background":"Cognitive control constrains mental operations to prioritize information that reaches conscious awareness and is essential to flexible, adaptive behavior under conditions of uncertainty. Cognitive control can be compromised by neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is characterized by the presence of social and communicative deficits, and restricted interests\/repetitive behaviors. Although prior investigations have attempted to elucidate the nature of cognitive control in ASD, whether there is an underlying information processing deficit associated with cognitive control remains unclear.","conclusion":"Results demonstrated that the ASD group performed less efficiently on sequential and nonsequential information processing, and had reduced cognitive control capacity under time constraint relative to the TD group. These findings suggest that inefficient cognitive control of information processing may be a fundamental deficit in ASD."},{"method":"In the current study, cerebral cortical grey matter volume, thickness, and surface area were assayed from MRI scans of 112, 3-year-old boys with ASD and 50 age-matched TD boys.

Previous analyses from this cohort have shown that the children with autism have a total brain volume at time 1 (&#x223c;3 years of age) that is 6% larger than typically developing (TD) children. This finding is driven primarily by 15% of the boys with ASD that have disproportionate megalencephaly (ASD-DM) or brain size that is 1.5 standard deviations above what would be expected for the child's height.","conclusion":"Current analyses indicate that cortical thickness was comparable across the ASD and TD groups. However, surface area was significantly greater in the ASD group compared to the TD group. This result was driven largely by the children with ASD-DM. Even in the ASD-DM group, not all cortical regions demonstrated increased surface area. These results provide strong evidence that the early cortical overgrowth associated with ASD is due primarily to increased surface area and not to increased cortical thickness."},{"method":"In this study, we analyzed home video diaries collected prospectively as part of a longitudinal study of infant siblings. Infant vowel and consonant-vowel vocalizations and maternal language-promoting and non-promoting verbal responses were scored for 30 infant siblings and 30 low risk control infants at 9 months of age. Analyses evaluated whether infant siblings or their mothers exhibited differences from low risk dyads in vocalization frequency or distribution, and whether mothers' responses were associated with other features of the high risk context. Analyses were conducted with respect to both initial risk group and preliminary outcome classification.","background":"Infant siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder display differences in early language and social communication skills beginning as early as the first year of life. While environmental influences on early language development are well documented in other infant populations, they have received relatively little attention inside of the infant sibling context.","conclusion":"Overall, we found no differences in infants' consonant-vowel vocalizations, the frequency of overall maternal utterances, or the distribution of mothers' response types. Both groups of infants produced more vowel than consonant-vowel vocalizations, and both groups of mothers responded to consonant-vowel vocalizations with more language-promoting than non-promoting responses. These results indicate that as a group, mothers of high risk infants provide equally high quality linguistic input to their infants in the first year of life and suggest that impoverished maternal linguistic input does not contribute to high risk infants' initial language difficulties.

Therefore, robots provide therapists and researchers a means to connect with autistic subjects in an easier way, but studies in this area are still insufficient.

Current assessment and treatment of anxiety, which rely on the observation of behavior and self-reports, are often ineffective as ASD is associated with deficits in communication and diminished introspective ability. In this light, autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity has been suggested as a marker of physiological arousal associated with anxiety. However, physiological arousal measured by ANS indices also occurs with other cognitive and emotional processes, and it is unclear whether anxiety-related arousal can be differentiated from that related to other cognitive processes.","conclusion":"Our results indicate that over 80% classification accuracy can be achieved, suggesting that ANS response can be used as a specific marker of anxiety-related arousal in a subgroup of children with ASD who demonstrate an increase in heart rate in response to anxiogenic stimuli."},{"method":"To examine how mutation\/deletion of SHANK3 might alter brain function leading to ASD, we have independently created mice with deletion of Shank3 exons 4-9, a region implicated in ASD patients.","background":"Shank3 is a multi-domain, synaptic scaffolding protein that organizes proteins in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses.

Behaviorally, both Shank3(e4-9) heterozygous (HET) and Shank3(e4-9) KO mice display increased repetitive grooming, deficits in novel and spatial object recognition learning and memory, and abnormal ultrasonic vocalizations. Shank3(e4-9) KO mice also display abnormal social interaction when paired with one another. Analysis of synaptosome fractions from striata of Shank3(e4-9) KO mice reveals decreased Homer1b\/c, GluA2, and GluA3 expression. Both Shank3(e4-9) HET and KO demonstrated a significant reduction in NMDA\/AMPA ratio at excitatory synapses onto striatal medium spiny neurons. Furthermore, Shank3(e4-9) KO mice displayed reduced hippocampal LTP despite normal baseline synaptic transmission.

BTBR mice also exhibit decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling and reduced hippocampal neurogenesis.","conclusion":"Transplantation of MSC resulted in a reduction of stereotypical behaviors, a decrease in cognitive rigidity and an improvement in social behavior. Tissue analysis revealed elevated BDNF protein levels in the hippocampus accompanied by increased hippocampal neurogenesis in the MSC-transplanted mice compared with sham treated mice. This might indicate a possible mechanism underpinning the behavioral improvement. Our study suggests a novel therapeutic approach which may be translatable to ASD patients in the future."},{"method":"Thirty-two children with ASD and 32 age- and nonverbal IQ-matched typically developing (TD) children were administered a multiple conjunction search task.","background":"In multiple conjunction search, the target is not known in advance but is defined only with respect to the distractors in a given search array, thus reducing the contributions of bottom-up and top-down attentional and perceptual processes during search. This study investigated whether the superior visual search skills typically demonstrated by individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) would be evident in multiple conjunction search.","conclusion":"Contrary to findings from the large majority of studies on visual search in ASD, response times of individuals with ASD were significantly slower than those of their TD peers. Evidence of slowed performance in ASD suggests that the mechanisms responsible for superior ASD performance in other visual search paradigms are not available in multiple conjunction search. Although the ASD group failed to exhibit superior performance, they showed efficient search and intertrial priming levels similar to the TD group. Efficient search indicates that ASD participants were able to group distractors into distinct subsets. In summary, while demonstrating grouping and priming effects comparable to those exhibited by their TD peers, children with ASD were slowed in their performance on a multiple conjunction search task, suggesting that their usual superior performance in visual search tasks is specifically dependent on top-down and\/or bottom-up attentional and perceptual processes."},{"method":"To identify common genetic variations conferring the risk of ASD, we performed a two-stage genome-wide association study using ASD family and healthy control samples obtained from East Asian populations. A total of 166 ASD families (n = 500) and 642 healthy controls from the Japanese population were used as the discovery cohort. Approximately 900,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP array 6.0 chips. In the replication stage, 205 Japanese ASD cases and 184 healthy controls, as well as 418 Chinese Han trios (n = 1,254), were genotyped by TaqMan platform. Case-control analysis, family based association test, and transmission\/disequilibrium test (TDT) were then conducted to test the association.","background":"Autism spectrum disorder is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with strong genetic basis.","conclusion":"In the discovery stage, significant associations were suggested for 14 loci, including 5 known ASD candidate genes: GPC6, JARID2, YTHDC2, CNTN4, and CSMD1. In addition, significant associations were identified for several novel genes with intriguing functions, such as JPH3, PTPRD, CUX1, and RIT2. After a meta-analysis combining the Japanese replication samples, the strongest signal was found at rs16976358 (P = 6.04 &#xd7; 10(-7)), which is located near the RIT2 gene.

In contrast, lower coherence values involved frontal electrodes in the right hemisphere. No significant differences between groups were found for interhemispheric EEG coherence. These results show that the analysis of EEG coherence during REM sleep can disclose patterns of cortical connectivity that can be reduced or increased in adults with autism compared to typically developed individuals, depending of the cortical areas studied.

Recent studies suggest that TMS measures provide rapid and noninvasive pathophysiological ASD biomarkers. Furthermore, repetitive TMS (rTMS) may represent a novel treatment strategy for reducing some of the core and associated ASD symptoms. However, the available literature on the TMS use in ASD is preliminary, composed of studies with methodological limitations. Thus, off-label clinical rTMS use for therapeutic interventions in ASD without an investigational device exemption and outside of an IRB approved research trial is premature pending further, adequately powered and controlled trials.","conclusion":"Here we review the literature in the use of TMS in ASD in the context of the unique challenges required for the study and exploration of treatment strategies in this population.

Consistent with other pragmatic language deficits, individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are said to produce fewer conversational gestures, as specified in many diagnostic measures. Surprisingly, while research shows fewer deictic gestures in young children with ASD, there is a little empirical evidence addressing other forms of gesture. The discrepancy between clinical and empirical observations may reflect impairments unrelated to frequency, such as gesture quality or integration with speech.","conclusion":"Overall, the ASD group's stories were rated as less clear and engaging. Although utterance and gesture rates were comparable, the ASD group's gestures were less closely synchronized with the co-occurring speech, relative to control participants. This gesture-speech synchrony specifically impacted communicative quality across participants. Furthermore, while story ratings were associated with gesture count in TD adolescents, no such relationship was observed in adolescents with ASD, suggesting that gestures do not amplify communication in this population. Quality ratings were, however, correlated with ASD symptom severity scores, such that participants with fewer ASD symptoms were rated as telling higher quality stories. Implications of these findings are discussed in terms of communication and neuropsychological functioning in ASD."},{"method":"In the present study, we examined whether the attention deficit\/hyperactivity disorder drugs methylphenidate and atomoxetine (which increase dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex, but not striatum, in mice) could alleviate the behavioral abnormalities and changes in dendritic spine morphology induced by prenatal VPA exposure.","background":"Rodents exposed prenatally to valproic acid (VPA) show autism-related behavioral abnormalities.

Acute treatment with methylphenidate or atomoxetine did not alleviate the social interaction deficits or recognition memory impairment in VPA-treated mice, while chronic treatment for 2 weeks did. Methylphenidate or atomoxetine for 2 weeks also improved the prenatal VPA-induced decrease in dendritic spine density in the prefrontal cortex. The effects of these drugs on behaviors and dendritic spine morphology were antagonized by concomitant treatment with the dopamine-D1 receptor antagonist SCH39166 or the dopamine-D2 receptor antagonist raclopride, but not by the &#x3b1;2 -adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan.

However, the expected crowding effect at one gap-size opening distance was evidenced for the control group only; a small effect was observed for the autism group at two gap-size opening. These results suggest that although far visual acuity is unremarkable in autism, altered local lateral connectivity within early perceptual areas underlying spatial information processing in autism is atypical. Altered local lateral connectivity in autism might originate from an imbalance in excitatory\/inhibitory neural signaling, resulting in changes regarding elementary feature extraction and subsequent downstream visual integration and visuo-spatial analysis.

Interestingly, they show increased social interaction with unfamiliar mice and do not show typical social habituation processes, reminiscent of the hypersociability observed in WBS patients. The mice do not appear to show increased anxiety, supporting a specific effect of Gtf2i on defined domains of the WBS phenotype.

For mothers of children with ASD, the BAP uniquely predicted number of depressive symptoms after controlling for child autism severity and parenting stress. In the full sample, the relationship between group status and depressed mood was no longer significant after controlling for parenting stress and maternal BAP. These findings suggest that the higher rate of depression found in mothers of children with ASD may be attributed both to the increased stress of raising a child with ASD, as well as a greater number of autistic features in the mothers that may place them at higher risk for developing depression."},{"method":"Here, we modify this conclusion, reporting that interneuron numbers are unchanged in the neocortex of Met(fx\/fx) \/ Dlx5\/6(cre) mice, in which Met is ablated from cells arising from the ventral telencephalon (VTel).

Low levels of Met protein are expressed in the VTel at E12.5 and E14.5, likely reflecting the arrival of Met containing corticofugal axons.

The diversity and complexity of the phenotype of these mouse models reflect the broad range of phenotypes observed in patients with ASD. Remarkably, results from therapeutic approaches (e.g., modulation of gene expression, administration of pharmacological and nonpharmacological substances, enriched environment) are encouraging since some behavioral alterations could be reversed even when treatment was performed on adult mice.

They may be less sensitive to people's goals and, more generally, focus on visual details instead of the entire scene. To examine these differences, people with and without ASD were asked to detect changes in dynamic scenes with multiple elements.","conclusion":"Our results indicate that, like controls, people with ASD noticed a change in the \"goal\" object at the end of a person's movement more often than the object at the start. However, the group with ASD did not undergo the developmental improvement that was evident typically when detecting changes in both the start and end objects. This atypical development led to deficits in adults with ASD that were not specific to scenes with people or to \"goals.\" Improvements in visual processing that underlie mature representation of scenes may not occur in ASD, suggesting that late developing brain processes are affected."},{"method":"These mice did not show deficits in activity level in the open field or anxiety-like behavior on the elevated plus maze, two potential confounds in the evaluation of mouse social behavior. In the three-chamber social test, mice lacking integrin &#x3b2;3 were shown to have normal sociability but did not show a preference for social novelty. Importantly, the absence of integrin &#x3b2;3 did not impair olfaction or the ability to recall familiar social odors. Additionally, mice lacking integrin &#x3b2;3 showed increased grooming behavior in novel environments.","background":"Elevated whole blood serotonin 5-HT, or hyperserotonemia, is a common biomarker in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The integrin &#x3b2;3 receptor subunit gene (ITGB3) is a quantitative trait locus for whole blood 5-HT levels. Recent work shows that integrin &#x3b2;3 interacts with the serotonin transporter (SERT) in both platelets and in the midbrain. Furthermore, multiple studies have now reported gene-gene interaction between the integrin &#x3b2;3 and SERT genes in association with ASD. Given the lack of previous data on the impact of integrin &#x3b2;3 on brain or behavioral phenotypes, we sought to compare mice with decreased or absent expression of the integrin &#x3b2;3 receptor subunit (Itgb3 +\/- and -\/-) with wildtype littermate controls in behavioral tasks relevant to ASD.","conclusion":"These preliminary studies reveal altered social and repetitive behavior in these mice, which suggests that the integrin &#x3b2;3 subunit may be involved in brain systems relevant to ASD. Further work is needed to fully characterize these behavioral changes and the underlying brain mechanisms."},{"method":"Speech samples were obtained from 30 toddlers with ASD, 11 age-matched toddlers and 23 language-matched toddlers during either parent-child or clinician-child play sessions. Samples were coded for a variety of speech-like and nonspeech vocalization productions.","background":"The purpose of this study is to examine the phonological and other vocal productions of children, 18-36 months, with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and to compare these productions to those of age-matched and language-matched controls.","conclusion":"Toddlers with ASD produced speech-like vocalizations similar to those of language-matched peers, but produced significantly more atypical nonspeech vocalizations when compared to both control groups. Toddlers with ASD show speech-like sound production that is linked to their language level, in a manner similar to that seen in typical development. The main area of difference in vocal development in this population is in the production of atypical vocalizations. Findings suggest that toddlers with ASDs do not tune into the language model of their environment. Failure to attend to the ambient language environment negatively impacts the ability to acquire spoken language."},{"method":"We genotyped a 14-year-old boy with autism, spherocytosis and other physical dysmorphia, his parents, and two non-autistic siblings with the Illumina Human 1M Beadchip as part of a study of the molecular genetics of autism and determined copy number variants using the PennCNV algorithm.","background":"Autism is a neuro-developmental disorder characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication as well as restricted interests or repetitive behaviors. Cytogenetic studies have implicated large chromosomal aberrations in the etiology of approximately 5-7% of autism patients, and the recent advent of array-based techniques allows the exploration of submicroscopic copy number variations (CNVs).","conclusion":"We identified and validated a de novo 1.5&#x2009;Mb microdeletion of 14q23.2-23.3 in our autistic patient. This region contains 15 genes, including spectrin beta (SPTB), encoding a cytoskeletal protein previously associated with spherocytosis, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 (MTHFD1), a folate metabolizing enzyme previously associated with bipoloar disorder and schizophrenia, pleckstrin homology domain-containing family G member 3 (PLEKHG3), a guanide nucleotide exchange enriched in the brain, and churchill domain containing protein 1 (CHURC1), homologs of which regulate neuronal development in model organisms. While a similar deletion has previously been reported in a family with spherocytosis, severe learning disabilities, and mild mental retardation, this is the first implication of chr14q23.2-23.3 in the etiology of autism and points to MTHFD1, PLEKHG3, and CHURC1 as potential candidate genes contributing to autism risk."},{"method":"Thionin-stained sections were used to qualitatively assess cytoarchitectonic patterning and quantitatively determine the density of neurons and immunohistochemistry was used to determine the densities of a subset of GABAergic interneurons utilizing parvalbumin-and calbindin-immunoreactivity.","background":"Autism is a developmental disorder with prenatal origins, currently estimated to affect 1 in 91 children in the United States. Social-emotional deficits are a hallmark of autism and early neuropathology studies have indicated involvement of the limbic system. Imaging studies demonstrate abnormal activation of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a component of the limbic system. Abnormal activation has also been noted in the fusiform gyrus (FFG), a region important for facial recognition and a key element in social interaction. A potential imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in the cortex may contribute to altered information processing in autism. Furthermore, reduced numbers of GABA receptors have previously been reported in the autistic brain.","conclusion":"In autism, the PCC displayed altered cytoarchitecture with irregularly distributed neurons, poorly demarcated layers IV and V, and increased presence of white matter neurons. In contrast, no neuropathology was observed in the FFG. There was no significant difference in the density of thionin, parvalbumin, or calbindin interneurons in either region and there was a trend towards a reduced density of calbindin neurons in the PCC. This study highlights the presence of abnormal findings in the PCC, which appear to be developmental in nature and could affect the local processing of social-emotional behaviors as well as functioning of interrelated areas."},{"method":"In this follow-up study, we sequenced the coding regions of the IL1RAPL1 gene in 14 male cases representing one case from each pedigree that showed at least nominal linkage evidence on per pedigree basis to the chromosome X region.","background":"Finding predisposition genes for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has proven challenging, and new methods are needed to aid the process. Using pedigree structure as a strategy to identify ASD predisposition genes, we previously performed a genome-wide linkage scan of 86 selected families from the Autism Resource Exchange (AGRE) that appeared to inherit ASD in a dominant manner. We identified a suggestive linkage peak on chromosome Xp22.11-p21.2 that encompasses the IL1RAPL1 gene, a strong candidate gene for ASD.","conclusion":"We observed no deleterious mutations or deletions in the IL1RAPL1 gene in these 14 ASD cases. A SNP was identified in exon 2 in five cases and a variant of unknown significance was identified in intron 6 in a single case.

Drawing on the findings of a major international gathering of researchers, ethicists, and activists, this paper presents the first major analysis of the ethical questions arising from this unease.","conclusion":"Having done so, we contend that these ethical questions are unlikely to be resolved as they depend on fundamentally conflicting assumptions about the nature and desirability of neurocognitive difference. We conclude by arguing for a new range of democratic mechanisms that could enable the scientific community, autistics, and other concerned parties to respond collectively to such entrenched ethical disputes."},{"method":"To address this question, we examined the extent to which adults with ASC were capable of developing expertise with non-face objects. To become experts, all participants completed a 2-week training program with novel objects, known as Greebles. Level of expertise was assessed throughout training by measuring the ability to identify Greebles on an individual level. The perceptual strategies acquired as a result of expertise were measured through an inversion effect task completed before and after training, in which performance with upright Greebles and faces was compared to performance with inverted Greebles and faces.","background":"Previous research indicates that individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) do not develop face expertise to the same extent as typical individuals. Yet it remains unclear whether this atypicality is specific to faces or related to more pervasive perceptual or cognitive deficits involved in the actual process of gaining expertise.","conclusion":"After expertise training, it was found that individuals in both the ASC and the typical group successfully achieved expertise and showed an enhanced Greeble inversion effect as a result of training. The development of an inversion effect with Greebles suggests that individuals with ASC may employ the same processing strategies as the typical group. Although exploratory, these findings have implications for understanding the nature of the face processing deficit in ASC as well as offering potential insights into face processing interventions for individuals with ASC."},{"method":"In this study, we investigated whether multisensory processing deficits in ASD persist when semantically complex but nonsocial stimuli are presented in succession. Fifteen adult individuals with Asperger syndrome and 15 control persons participated in a visual-audio priming task, which required the classification of sounds that were either primed by semantically congruent or incongruent preceding pictures of objects.","background":"Individuals suffering from autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often show a tendency for detail- or feature-based perception (also referred to as \"local processing bias\") instead of more holistic stimulus processing typical for unaffected people. This local processing bias has been demonstrated for the visual and auditory domains and there is evidence that multisensory processing may also be affected in ASD. Most multisensory processing paradigms used social-communicative stimuli, such as human speech or faces, probing the processing of simultaneously occuring sensory signals. Multisensory processing, however, is not limited to simultaneous stimulation.","conclusion":"As expected, performance on congruent trials was faster and more accurate compared with incongruent trials (crossmodal priming effect). The Asperger group, however, did not differ significantly from the control group. Our results do not support a general multisensory processing deficit, which is universal to the entire autism spectrum."},{"method":"We contrasted standardized face recognition scores on the Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT) for 34 individuals with AS with those for 42, IQ-matched non-ASD individuals, and age-standardized scores from a large Australian cohort. We also examined the influence of IQ, autistic traits, and negative affect on face recognition performance.","background":"Although face recognition deficits in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), including Asperger syndrome (AS), are widely acknowledged, the empirical evidence is mixed. This in part reflects the failure to use standardized and psychometrically sound tests.","conclusion":"Overall, participants with AS performed significantly worse on the CFMT than the non-ASD participants and when evaluated against standardized test norms. However, while 24% of participants with AS presented with severe face recognition impairment (&gt;2 SDs below the mean), many individuals performed at or above the typical level for their age: 53% scored within +\/- 1 SD of the mean and 9% demonstrated superior performance (&gt;1 SD above the mean). Regression analysis provided no evidence that IQ, autistic traits, or negative affect significantly influenced face recognition: diagnostic group membership was the only significant predictor of face recognition performance. In sum, face recognition performance in ASD is on a continuum, but with average levels significantly below non-ASD levels of performance."},{"method":"The NL3 KI mouse model has marked volume differences in many different structures in the brain: gray matter structures, such as the hippocampus, the striatum, and the thalamus, were all found to be smaller in the NL3 KI. Further, many white matter structures were found to be significantly smaller, such as the cerebral peduncle, corpus callosum, fornix\/fimbria, and internal capsule. Fractional anisotropy measurements in these structures were also measured, and no differences were found.","background":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used quite extensively for examining morphological changes in human and animal brains. One of the many advantages to examining mouse models of human autism is that we are able to examine single gene targets, like that of Neuroligin3 R451C knockin (NL3 KI), which has been directly implicated in human autism.","conclusion":"The volume changes in the white matter regions, therefore, are not due to a general breakdown in the microstructure of the tissue and seem to be caused by fewer axons or less mature axons. A larger radial diffusivity was also found in localized regions of the corpus callosum and cerebellum. The corpus callosal changes are particularly interesting as the thinning (or reduced volume) of the corpus callosum is a consistent finding in autism. This suggests that the NL3 KI model may be useful for examining white matter changes associated with autism."},{"method":"We investigated whether thyroxine (T4) levels at birth are associated with subsequent ASD, using two existing California study groups in multivariate analysis.

Minor developmental differences were detected between NL3 and WT, including slightly different rates of somatic growth, slower righting reflexes at postnatal days 2-6, faster homing reflexes in females, and less vocalizations on postnatal day 8 in males. Significant differences in NL3 adults included somewhat longer latencies to fall from the rotarod, less vertical activity in the open field, and less acoustic startle to high decibel tones.","background":"Neuroligin-3 is a member of the class of cell adhesion proteins that mediate synapse development and have been implicated in autism.

ASD performance was also specifically reduced when items could not be physically removed from the testing array, although this effect could be ameliorated by keeping a written record of participant questions during search.","background":"Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) adopt less efficient strategies than typically developing controls (TD) on verbal problem-solving tests such as the Twenty Questions Task. This study examined the hypotheses that this can be explained by differences in (i) planning processes or (ii) selective attention.","conclusion":"These findings indicate that ASD participants are sensitive to the within-task executive demands of Twenty Questions, but that their inefficiency in strategy relates to planning processes and question selection pretask.

Exploring patterns within families revealed that 80% of probands with a mother who had a mood disorder history also had a mood disorder themselves, compared to only 16% of probands whose mothers did not have a mood disorder history. The results must be considered preliminary given the small sample size. Replicating these findings in a larger sample would help clarify whether a true increased risk of mood disorder exists, which would have potential implications for prevention efforts and understanding possible genetic mechanisms."},{"method":"We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of potential rapid phenotyping procedures using the Social Communication Questionnaire and the Social Responsiveness Scale in a sample of 333 children who also received extensive phenotypic assessments.","background":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is considered among the most heritable of all neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, but identification of etiologically significant genetic markers and risk variants has been hampered by a lack of sufficiently large samples. Rapid phenotyping procedures, where self-report measures are used instead of extensive clinical assessment, have been proposed as methods for amassing large genetic databases due to their hypothesized time-efficiency and affordability.","conclusion":"While the rapid phenotyping measures were able to accurately identify a large number of children with ASD, they also frequently failed to differentiate children with ASD from children with other complex neurobehavioral profiles.

Fourteen adolescent boys with ASD (15-17 years old) and 14 age- and verbal IQ-matched TD boys participated.","background":"In typically developing (TD) individuals, behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) studies suggest that audiovisual (AV) integration enables faster and more efficient processing of speech.

The posterior effect (200-300 ms interval) was specifically sensitive to lip movements in TD boys, and no AV modulation was observed in this region for the ASD group. Moreover, the magnitude of the posterior AV effect to visual speech correlated inversely with ASD symptomatology. In addition, the ASD boys showed an unexpected effect (P2 time window) over the frontocentral region (pooled electrodes F3, Fz, F4, FC1, FC2, FC3, FC4), which was sensitive to scrambled face stimuli.

In line with this notion, a nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism within a highly conserved domain of HOXA1--A218G (rs10951154)--has been linked to both ASD risk, and cross-sectional differences in superior posterior lobar cerebellar anatomy in late adulthood. Despite evidence for early onset and developmentally dynamic cerebellar involvement in ASD, little is known of the relationship between A218G genotype and maturation of the cerebellum over early development.","conclusion":"Total cerebellar volume increased between ages of 5 and 23 years in both groups. However, this was accelerated in the Gcar relative to the AA group (Genotype-by-age interaction term, P = 0.03), and driven by genotype-dependent differences in the rate of bilateral superior posterior lobar volume change with age (P = 0.002). Resultantly, although superior posterior lobar volume did not differ significantly between genotype groups at age 5 (P = 0.9), by age 23 it was 12% greater in Gcar than AA (P = 0.002). Our results suggest that common genetic variation within this putative ASD risk gene has the capacity to modify the development of cerebellar systems implicated in ASD neurobiology."},{"method":"We computed the head movement stereotypy with multiscale entropy analysis. In addition, the head rotation range (RR) and the amount of rotation per minute (ARPM) were calculated to quantify the extent of head movement.","background":"The present study implemented an objective head pose tracking technique-OpenFace 2.0 to quantify the three dimensional head movement.

Further analyses revealed that the extent of head movement could be significantly explained by movement stereotypy, but not by the amount of visual fixation to the interlocutress.

It is proposed that head movement might potentially provide novel objective biomarkers of ASD. LAY SUMMARY: Our study used an objective tool to quantify head movement in children with autism.

This study found that the CARS may not provide cross-culturally valid ASD assessments. Thus, cross-cultural comparisons with the CARS should consider first which items operate differently across samples of interest, since its cross-cultural measurement non-invariance could be a source of cross-cultural variability in ASD presentations.

After initial dose-response experiments in zebrafish larvae, 10&#xa0;&#x3bc;M VPA exposure between 0.33 and 4.5&#x2009;days post fertilization (dpf) was identified as an effective concentration that led to an early and persistent ASD-like phenotype in zebrafish.

Acute administration of DLX (4.5-6 dpf) reduced the VPA-induced ASD-like phenotype in zebrafish larvae.","background":"Syndromic autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by impaired social communication and repetitive\/stereotyped behaviors. Currently available therapeutic agents against ASD have limited efficacy.

This was accompanied by reduced AChE activity and by normalized Akt-mTOR signaling.

Data from the Mullen Scales of Early Learning and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Second Edition, a parent-report tool, were analyzed in a sample of 64 autistic and 73 neurotypical children (28-69&#x2009;months).","background":"Intellectual assessment in preschool autistic children bears many challenges, particularly for those who have lower language and\/or cognitive abilities. These challenges often result in underestimation of their potential or exclusion from research studies. Understanding how different instruments and definitions used to identify autistic preschool children with global developmental delay (GDD) affect sample composition is critical to advance research on this understudied clinical population.","conclusion":"Our results highlight that cognitive assessment alone should not be used in clinical or research practices to infer a comorbid diagnosis of GDD, as it might lead to underestimating autistic children's potential. Instead, using both adaptive and cognitive levels as a stratification method to create subgroups of children with and without GDD might be a promising approach to adequately differentiate them, with less risk of underestimating them."},{"method":"To this end, we used event-related potentials to investigate whether individuals with ASD would show different neural responses to local (within trial) versus global (across trials) emotion regularities extracted from sequential facial expressions; and if so, whether this visual abnormality would generalize to the music (auditory) domain. Twenty individuals with ASD and 21 age- and IQ-matched individuals with typical development participated in this study.","background":"Whether autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with a global processing deficit remains controversial. Global integration requires extraction of regularity across various timescales, yet little is known about how individuals with ASD process regularity at local (short timescale) versus global (long timescale) levels.","conclusion":"At an early processing stage, ASD participants exhibited preserved neural responses to violations of local emotion regularity for both faces and music. At a later stage, however, there was an absence of neural responses in ASD to violations of global emotion regularity for both faces and music. These findings suggest that the autistic brain responses to emotion regularity are modulated by the timescale of sequential stimuli, and provide insight into the neural mechanisms underlying emotional processing in ASD."},{"method":"In this study, matched groups of autistic and non-autistic adults completed a novel emotion-based task which employed dynamic displays of happy, angry and sad point light facial (PLF) expressions. On each trial, participants moved a slider to manipulate the speed of a PLF stimulus until it moved at a speed that, in their 'mind's eye', was typical of happy, angry or sad expressions. Participants were shown three different types of PLFs-those showing the full-face, only the eye region, and only the mouth region, wherein the latter two were included to test whether differences in facial information sampling underpinned any dissimilarities in speed attributions.","background":"Recent developments suggest that autistic individuals require dynamic angry expressions to have a higher speed in order for them to be successfully identified. Therefore, it is plausible that autistic individuals do not have a 'deficit' in angry expression recognition, but rather their internal representation of these expressions is characterised by very high-speed movement.","conclusion":"Across both groups, participants attributed the highest speeds to angry, then happy, then sad, facial motion. Participants increased the speed of angry and happy expressions by 41% and 27% respectively and decreased the speed of sad expressions by 18%. This suggests that participants have 'caricatured' internal representations of emotion, wherein emotion-related kinematic cues are over-emphasised. There were no differences between autistic and non-autistic individuals in the speeds attributed to full-face and partial-face angry, happy and sad expressions respectively. Consequently, we find no evidence that autistic adults possess atypically fast internal representations of anger."},{"method":"To achieve this goal we presented participants with images of their own face, the face of a close-other, and famous and unknown faces in a Stroop-like paradigm. Participants (22 with ASD, 22 typically developing [TD]) were instructed to indicate the color of presented faces while EEG was recorded.","background":"Converging lines of evidence seem to indicate reduced self-referential processing in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, processing of one's own face has rarely been investigated in the context of ASD. Thus, the aim of the present study was to elucidate the role of attentional biases in the processing of self- and other faces in ASD.","conclusion":"Our event-related potential results clearly showed that self-face was associated with larger P3 amplitudes than all other faces in the TD group, thus indicating a strong attentional bias toward one's own face. In the ASD group, P3 to the self-face and the close-other's face did not differ, suggesting similar attentional biases in both cases. In line with these P3 findings, nonparametric cluster-based permutation tests showed an analogous pattern of results: significant clusters for the self-face compared with all other faces in the TD group, and no significant cluster in the ASD group. Overall, our findings revealed impaired attentional bias to one's own face and diminished self versus other differentiation in individuals with ASD. The similar neural underpinnings of the self-face and other faces supports previous findings indicating reduced self-prioritization among individuals with ASD."},{"method":"This study involved participants (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;1178) enrolled in RI-CART with available mother and father ages at birth. Primary data points included the age of mother and father at the participant's birth and results from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule - Second Edition (ADOS-2).","background":"Advanced parental age at offspring birth has been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The objective of the current study was to investigate associations between parental age at birth and autism severity.

Fathers of children with ASD were 1.6&#x2009;years older at the time of birth than fathers of children without ASD. The age of both parents at offspring birth displayed a positive, statistically significant association with overall ASD severity and the severity of restricted\/repetitive behaviors. This finding was driven by the association between parental age and the severity of compulsions or rituals.

Mixed linear models were used to test the association between the carrier status of VCS\/VUS or the genetic scores with intervention outcomes measured by the social responsiveness scale. Additionally, we combined behavioral and genetic features using a machine learning (ML) model to predict the individual response.","background":"Exome sequencing has been proposed as the first-tier genetic testing in autism spectrum disorder (ASD).","conclusion":"We showed a rate of 4.4% and 11.3% of VCS and VUS in the cohort, respectively. Individuals with VCS or VUS had improved significantly less after standard care than non-carriers at post-intervention (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;9.35; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.036), while no such association was observed for SSGT (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-2.50; p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.65). Higher rare variant genetic scores for synaptic transmission and regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II were separately associated with less beneficial (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;8.30, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.0044) or more beneficial (&#x3b2;&#xa0;=&#xa0;-6.79, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.014) effects after SSGT compared with standard care at follow-up, respectively.

Identified variants were genotyped in 664 families (2,712 individuals including 1,228 with ASD) and 312 unrelated controls. Replicating our initial findings, family-based association test (FBAT) analyses demonstrated that the MET promoter variant rs1858830 C allele was associated with ASD in 101 new families (P=0.033).","background":"A functional promoter variant of the gene encoding the MET receptor tyrosine kinase alters SP1 and SUB1 transcription factor binding, and is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Recent analyses of postmortem cerebral cortex from ASD patients revealed altered expression of MET protein and three transcripts encoding proteins that regulate MET signaling, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (PLAUR) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (SERPINE1).","conclusion":"Two other genes in the MET signaling pathway also may confer risk. A haplotype of the SERPINE1 gene exhibited significant association. In addition, the PLAUR promoter variant rs344781 T allele was associated with ASD by both FBAT (P=0.006) and case-control analyses (P=0.007). The PLAUR promoter rs344781 relative risk was 1.93 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12-3.31) for genotype TT and 2.42 (95% CI: 1.38-4.25) for genotype CT compared to genotype CC. Gene-gene interaction analyses suggested a significant interaction between MET and PLAUR. These data further support our hypothesis that genetic susceptibility impacting multiple components of the MET signaling pathway contributes to ASD risk."},{"method":"Based on autistic adults' descriptions of their lived experiences, a Conceptual Model of Autistic Burnout (CMAB) is proposed, which describes a series of hypothesized relationships between identified risk and protective factors that may contribute to, or buffer against, autistic burnout. The theoretical framework for the CMAB is based on the Social-Relational model of disability and neurodiversity paradigm, and the Job Demands-Resources model of burnout, and Conservation of Resources theory. The CMAB offers a holistic perspective for understanding individual, social, and environmental factors that can influence autistic burnout via various direct and indirect pathways.","background":"Early qualitative research indicates that autistic burnout is commonly experienced by autistic people and is associated with significant, negative consequences for their mental health, wellbeing, and quality of life, including suicidality. Findings to date suggest that factors associated with being autistic and the widespread lack of autism awareness and acceptance within society contribute to the onset and recurrence of autistic burnout.","conclusion":"Autistic burnout research is in its infancy and the CMAB provides a foundation for future investigations about this condition.

Parents reported their children's sleep disturbances and ASD core symptoms using the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) and Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). Children's gaze patterns during the FER task were recorded by an eye tracking method.","background":"Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at high risk for sleep disturbances, but the mechanism underlying the association between sleep disturbances and ASD core symptoms is largely unknown.","conclusion":"We found (1) ASD children had more severe sleep disturbances than TD children; (2) ASD children had atypical gaze patterns and poor FER task performance as determined by lower accuracy and longer reaction time; (3) sleep disturbances were significantly associated with ASD core symptoms of social interaction, communication, and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior; and (4) atypical gaze patterns partially mediated the association between sleep disturbances and ASD core symptoms. These findings suggest the need for more comprehensive clinical interventions and more effective sleep interventions to improve ASD core symptoms. LAY SUMMARY: Sleep disturbances are very common in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The current study found that sleep disturbances were significantly associated with ASD core symptoms, and gaze patterns during facial emotion recognition task could partially mediate this relationship."},{"method":"Employing a classic lexically-guided perceptual learning paradigm, the present study investigated perceptual learning effects in Australian English autistic and non-autistic adults.","background":"The automatic retuning of phoneme categories to better adapt to the speech of a novel talker has been extensively documented across various (neurotypical) populations, including both adults and children. However, no studies have examined auditory perceptual learning effects in populations atypical in perceptual, social, and language processing for communication, such as populations with autism.","conclusion":"The findings revealed that automatic attunement to existing phoneme categories was not activated in the autistic group in the same manner as for non-autistic control subjects. Specifically, autistic adults were able to both successfully discern lexical items and to categorize speech sounds; however, they did not show effects of perceptual retuning to talkers. These findings may have implications for the application of current sensory theories (e.g., Bayesian decision theory) to speech and language processing by autistic individuals. LAY SUMMARY: Lexically guided perceptual learning assists in the disambiguation of speech from a novel talker. The present study established that while Australian English autistic adult listeners were able to successfully discern lexical items and categorize speech sounds in their native language, perceptual flexibility in updating speaker-specific phonemic knowledge when exposed to a novel talker was not available.

However, whether and how sensory processing is affected has not yet been considered in detail.","conclusion":"SBQ and CSP-2 responses found that sensory processing differences were clearly evident in both 16p11.2 deletion and 16p11.2 duplication, though there was significant variation in both cohorts. SBQ data indicated the frequency and impact of sensory behavior were more severe when compared to neurotypical children, with levels being similar to autistic children. CSP-2 data indicated over 70% of children displayed clear differences in sensory registration (missing sensory input). Seventy-one percent with 16p11.2 duplications were also unusually sensitive to sensory information and 57% with 16p11.2 duplications were unusually avoidant of sensory stimuli. This first detailed assessment of sensory processing, alongside other clinical features, in relatively large cohorts of children with a 16p11.2 deletion and 16p11.2 duplication demonstrates that sensory processing differences have a profound impact on their lives."},{"method":"In the current study, prospective data were collected from 141 children with ASD and 103 typically developing (TD) controls using parent responses to an 11-item behavioral survey.

Profiles of cases in which caregivers reported consistent behavioral improvements during fever are described.","background":"Anecdotal reports and a small number of research studies suggest possible behavioral improvements in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) during a fever. However, previous studies rely largely on retrospective reports of this phenomenon. Establishing a robust association between fever and reduction of ASD-related symptoms would promote opportunities for the development of innovative therapeutic interventions for children with ASD.","conclusion":"Data indicated worsening social, emotional\/behavioral, and somatic symptoms during a fever regardless of diagnosis, with children with ASD demonstrating greater worsening of behaviors during a fever than TD children. Only three out of 141 children with ASD demonstrated consistent behavioral improvements during a fever; these children had a range of cognitive and adaptive skills. Children with ASD had stronger negative responses to fever than TD children. These findings contradict previous literature suggesting behavioral improvements for children with ASD. While improvements may occur for some children, it does not appear to be a common phenomenon. Additional research is needed to elucidate the nature of behavioral improvements in the subset of children with ASD who may respond positively to fever."},{"method":"The current study examined correlates of observed emotion dysregulation in 61 children with ASD between the ages of 6 and 10&#x2009;years, including ASD symptom levels as well as both baseline RSA and concurrent RSA reactivity.","background":"Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience significant difficulties with emotion regulation. Theory and empirical evidence suggest substantial biological contributions to regulatory challenges, which may be related to core ASD symptoms. Respiratory sinus arrythmia (RSA) is a measure of parasympathetic nervous system activity that serves as a putative biomarker for emotion regulation. Higher baseline RSA and more RSA reactivity (parasympathetic withdrawal; RSA-R) in response to challenge appear adaptive in non-clinical populations, but existing evidence for children with ASD remains inconclusive.","conclusion":"Consistent with previous research, ASD symptom level was significantly correlated with observed dysregulation whereas additional factors such as child IQ were not. Baseline RSA was unrelated to observed dysregulation, but higher RSA reactivity predicted concurrent dysregulation above and beyond the contribution of child ASD symptoms. Findings contribute to an emerging understanding of dysregulation in these children, raise questions about the utility of traditional baseline RSA measures for this population, and clarify the functional significance of RSA reactivity as a risk factor for emotion dysregulation in children with ASD."},{"method":"The 34 ASD cases and 102 controls who had recovered from perinatal conditions were matched for age, sex, gestational age, birth weight and maternal age.

Both groups were matched with regard to sex and age.","background":"The electroretinogram (ERG) allows the investigation of retinal signaling pathways and has increasingly been applied in individuals with mental disorders in search for potential biomarkers of neurodevelopmental disorders. Preceding ERG examinations in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) showed inconsistent results, which might be due to the small number of participants, heterogeneity of the ASD population, differences in age ranges, and stimulation methods. The aim of this study was to investigate functional retinal responses in adults with ASD by means of the light-adapted (photopic) ERG.","conclusion":"No significant functional retinal differences in amplitude or peak time of the a- or b-wave, PhNR, the photopic hill parameters or the ERG-amplitude ratios could be detected in individuals with ASD compared to non-autistic participants. The absence of electrophysiological functional retinal alterations in ASD, suggests that changes in visual perception, such as increased attention to detail or visual hypersensitivity in ASD, are not due to impairments at early levels of retinal signal processing."},{"method":"This study explored the association of documented CoCs among 8-year-old children with ASD and ID (ASD+ID, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;2416) and ASD without ID (ASD-ID, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;5372) identified by the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, surveillance years (SYs) 2012 and 2014.

These traits are associated with atypicality of functional brain networks. Modular organization in the brain plays a crucial role in network stability and adaptability for neurodevelopment. Previous neuroimaging research demonstrates discrepancies in studies of functional brain modular organization in ASD. These discrepancies result from the examination of mixed age groups. Furthermore, recent findings suggest that while much attention has been given to deriving atlases and measuring the connections between nodes, within node information may also be crucial in determining altered modular organization in ASD compared with typical development (TD). However, altered modular organization originating from systematic nodal changes are yet to be explored in younger children with ASD.","conclusion":"We demonstrate that alterations in topological roles and modular cohesiveness are the two key properties of brain regions anchored in default mode, sensorimotor, and salience networks, and primarily relate to social and sensory deficits in children with ASD.

Moreover, parental reflective functioning moderated the effect of child maladaptive behaviors on parental hopelessness, such that children's maladaptive behaviors were positively associated with parental hopelessness in parents with low (but not high) reflective functioning.

Children in profile 2 had distinctly increased ST and more difficulty in making friends when compared with children in either other profile. A greater proportion of children in profiles 2 and 3 were receiving behavioral treatment compared to profile 1; however, no differences were observed among profiles according to ASD severity, medication status, or additional health conditions.

These results suggest that ASD core symptoms assessed by the AIM were similar among male and female groups. In addition, the latent means for all five factors were not statistically significantly different across sex groups, revealing no systematic differences on any of the AIM subscales for males and females.

Discriminant validity was investigated by comparing all three methods of measuring camouflaging to a measure of social skills, to test whether they assess a construct distinct from social ability.","background":"Interest in social camouflaging has led to a multiplicity of measurement methods of uncertain validity. This two-part investigation first used a systematic review (\"Study 1\") to identify and appraise methods used to quantify camouflaging of autistic traits, using the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Status Measurement Instruments checklist. A total of 16 distinct measurement tools were identified; all are in the preliminary phases of psychometric evaluation.

Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between social (but not nonsocial) WM capacity and the severity of autistic symptoms among children with ASD. In contrast, there is a positive correlation between both types of WM capacity and intelligence among TD children but not among children with ASD. Our findings thus indicate that individuals with ASD miss the rapid development of WM capacity in early childhood and, particularly, their delayed social WM development might contribute to core symptoms that critically depend on social information processing."},{"method":"To expand upon this work, the present study aimed to examine trajectories of teacher- and parent-reported maladaptive behaviors (i.e., hyperactivity, irritability, social withdrawal) and to test whether individual-level predictors (e.g., autism features, verbal intelligence quotient) and school-related predictors (e.g., teacher type, student-adult ratio, personal aide, school type) impact these trajectories among 165 individuals with ASD or non-spectrum delays from ages 9 to 18.

Existing research largely utilizes a single index of social attention and rarely includes children with intellectual impairment or uses a cross-syndrome approach.","conclusion":"Initial eye contact related to social scene attention, implicating that naturalistic social attention is consistent with responses during experimental conditions. Reduced eye contact and lower social scene attention characterized nsASD and FXS. Children with nsASD displayed less facial attention than FXS and NT children, who did not differ. Lower DQ and elevated ASD severity associated with decreased eye contact in nsASD and FXS, and lower DQ was associated with lower social scene attention in FXS. Sex, social anxiety, and age were not associated with social attention. These findings suggest social attention profiles of children with nsASD are highly similar to, yet distinct from, children with FXS. Children with nsASD may present with a global social attention deficit whereas FXS profiles may reflect context-dependent social avoidance."},{"method":"This study aimed to assess the integration of audiovisual information across autistic children and adolescents. MSI was measured using a non-social, simultaneity judgment task. Variation in temporal sensitivity was evaluated via Gaussian curve fitting procedures, allowing us to compare the width of temporal binding windows (TBWs), where wider TBWs indicate less sensitivity to temporal alignment. We compared TBWs in age and IQ matched groups of autistic (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;32) and neurotypical (NT; n&#xa0;=&#x2009;73) children and adolescents. The sensory profile of all participants was also measured.","background":"Atypical sensory perception has been recognized in autistic individuals since its earliest descriptions and is now considered a key characteristic of autism. Although the integration of sensory information (multisensory integration; MSI) has been demonstrated to be altered in autism, less is known about how this perceptual process differs with age.","conclusion":"Across all ages assessed (i.e., 6 through 18&#x2009;years), TBWs were negatively correlated with age in the autistic group. A significant correlation was not found in the NT group. When compared as a function of child (6-12&#x2009;years) and adolescent (13-18&#x2009;years) age groups, a significant interaction of group (autism vs NT) by age group was found, whereby TBWs became narrower with age in the autistic, but not neurotypical group. We also found a significant main effect of age and no significant main effect of group. Results suggest that TBW differences between autistic and neurotypical groups diminishes with increasing age, indicating an atypical developmental profile of MSI in autism which ameliorates across development."},{"method":"To characterize the hypo\/hyper-sensory profile, the differential Short Sensory Profile (dSSP) was defined as a normalized and centralized hypo\/hypersensitivity ratio from the Short Sensory Profile (SSP). Including 1136 participants (533 autistic individuals, 210 first-degree relatives, and 267 controls) from two independent study samples (PARIS and LEAP),","background":"As an integral part of autism spectrum symptoms, sensory processing issues including both hypo and hyper sensory sensitivities. These sensory specificities may result from an excitation\/inhibition imbalance with a poorly understood of their level of convergence with genetic alterations in GABA-ergic and glutamatergic pathways. In our study, we aimed to characterize the hypo\/hyper-sensory profile among autistic individuals. We then explored its link with the burden of deleterious mutations in a subset of individuals with available whole-genome sequencing data.","conclusion":"we observed a statistically significant dSSP mean difference between autistic individuals and controls, driven mostly by a high dSSP variability, with an intermediated profile represented by relatives. Our genetic analysis tended to associate the dSSP and the hyposensitivity with mutations of the GABAergic pathway. The major limitation was the dSSP difficulty to discriminate subjects with a similar quantum of hypo- and hyper-sensory symptoms to those with no such symptoms, resulting both in a similar ratio score of 0. However, the dSSP could be a relevant clinical score, and combined with additional sensory descriptions, genetics and endophenotypic substrates, will improve the exploration of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of sensory processing differences in autism spectrum."},{"method":"The current study aimed to further characterize RI and UI by exploring their association with age, sex, IQ, and social motivation, as well as to examine differences in the adaptive benefits and negative impacts of these two subdomains. Parents of 1892 autistic children and adolescents (M<sub>age<\/sub> &#xa0;=&#xa0;10.82, SD<sub>age<\/sub> &#xa0;=&#xa0;4.14; 420 females) completed an online survey including the Dimensional Assessment of Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors and the Social Communication Questionnaire.","background":"A broad range of interests characterized by unusual content and\/or intensity, labeled as circumscribed interests (CI), are a core diagnostic feature of autism. Recent evidence suggests that a distinction can be drawn between interests that, although characterized by unusually high intensity and\/or inflexibility, are otherwise common in terms of their content (e.g., an interest in movies or animals), labeled as restricted interests (RI), and interests that are generally not salient outside of autism (e.g., an interest in traffic lights or categorization), labeled as unusual interests (UI).","conclusion":"Both RI and UI were found to be highly frequent. Sex-based differences were observed in the content, but not intensity, of CI such that females were more likely to show interests with a social component. Finally, RI and UI showed distinct patterns of association with age, sex, IQ, and social motivation, as well as metrics of adaptive benefits and negative impacts. Findings afford a more nuanced understanding of sex-based differences in CI and, crucially, provide preliminary evidence that RI and UI represent distinct constructs that should be studied independently in future research."},{"method":"In the present study, we investigated the navigation behavior of a population of ASD and typically developing (TD) adults related to their brain anatomy as assessed by structural and functional MRI at rest. We used the Starmaze task, which permits assessing and distinguishing two complex navigation behaviors, one based on allocentric learning and the other on egocentric learning of a route with multiple decision points.","background":"Cerebellar abnormalities have been reported in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Beyond its role in hallmark features of ASD, the cerebellum and its connectivity with forebrain structures also play a role in navigation. However, the current understanding of navigation abilities in ASD is equivocal, as is the impact of the disorder on the functional anatomy of the cerebellum.","conclusion":"Compared to TD controls, individuals with ASD showed similar exploration, learning, and strategy performance and preference. In addition, there was no difference in the structural or functional anatomy of the cerebellar circuits involved in navigation between the two groups. The findings of our work suggest that navigation abilities, spatio-temporal memory, and their underlying circuits are preserved in individuals with ASD."},{"method":"We included 258 children (205 males and 53 females) who were first diagnosed with autism at age 6-18 in 2017-2018. We retrieved demographic information, neurologic and developmental symptoms, diagnoses, and medications dispensing history from the children's electronic medical charts.","background":"Despite increasing awareness for diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and initiating treatments early in life, many children and adolescents continue to be diagnosed at a relatively older age. Focusing on children who first received an ASD diagnosis at age six or older, this study aimed to describe the symptoms that parents reported when ASD was diagnosed, follow the patients' clinical trajectory prior to receiving the diagnosis, and describe differences in symptoms and prior diagnoses between males and females cases.","conclusion":"The data indicated that prior diagnoses of language delays and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder were common among children with a late ASD diagnosis. Two thirds of the children were prescribed one or more medications to treat psychosocial and behavioral conditions before receiving a late ASD diagnosis. Difficulties in social relationships with peers were the leading reported symptoms by parents at the time of ASD diagnosis. Across these different domains, some differences were found between males and females, including a somewhat higher cognitive level in males, who were also more likely to present aggressive behavior."},{"method":"A sample of 545 autistic adults without intellectual disability aged 18+ were recruited through the Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research, Research Match.

Mechanisms underlying the high prevalence of CVD risk factors in autistic people may include known correlates of CVD risk factors in other groups, including high levels of perceived stress, poor sleep quality, and antipsychotic medication use.","conclusion":"Overall, 73.2% of autistic adults in our sample had an overweight\/obesity classification, 45.3% had high cholesterol, 39.4% had high blood pressure, and 10.3% had diabetes. Older age, male sex assigned at birth, and poorer sleep quality were associated with a higher number of CVD risk factors. Using antipsychotic medications was associated with an increased likelihood of having diabetes. Poorer sleep quality was associated with an increased likelihood of having an overweight\/obesity classification. Self-reported CVD risk factors are highly prevalent among autistic adults. Both improving sleep quality and closely monitoring CVD risk factors among autistic adults who use antipsychotic medications have the potential to reduce risk for CVD."},{"method":"103 infants (68% male) showing early signs of autism were referred to the study by community healthcare professionals and seen for assessments when aged around 12-months (Time 1), 18-months (Time 2), and 24-months (Time 3). Latent profile analysis revealed inhibited\/low positive, active\/negative reactive, and sociable\/well-regulated subgroups at each timepoint, and a unique reactive\/regulated subgroup at Time 3.","background":"Our previous cross-sectional investigation (Chetcuti et al., 2020) showed that infants with autism traits could be divided into distinct subgroups based on temperament. This longitudinal study builds on this existing work by exploring the continuity of temperament subgroup classifications and their associations with behavioral\/clinical phenotypic features from infancy to toddlerhood.","conclusion":"Cross-tabulations indicated a significant likelihood of children having a recurrent subgroup classification from one timepoint to the next, and no apparent patterns to the movement of children who did change from one subgroup to another over time. Temperament subgroups were associated with concurrent child social-emotional functioning and autism traits, but unrelated to child age, sex, or developmental level. These findings suggest that temperament subgroup classifications might represent a reliable and very early indicator of autism characteristics and social-emotional functioning among infants\/toddlers with autism traits."},{"method":"In the present study, we investigated resting-state thalamocortical functional connectivity in 8-25&#x2009;year-olds with ASD and their typically developing (TD) peers. We used pre-scan training, on-line motion correction, and rigorous data quality assurance protocols to minimize motion confounds.","background":"There is converging evidence that abnormal thalamocortical interactions contribute to attention deficits and sensory sensitivities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, previous functional MRI studies of thalamocortical connectivity in ASD have produced inconsistent findings in terms of both the direction (hyper vs. hypoconnectivity) and location of group differences. This may reflect, in part, the confounding effects of head motion during scans.","conclusion":"ASD participants showed increased thalamic connectivity with temporal cortex relative to TD. Both groups showed similar age-related decreases in thalamic connectivity with occipital cortex, consistent with a process of circuit refinement. Findings of thalamocortical hyperconnectivity in ASD are consistent with other evidence that decreased thalamic inhibition leads to increase and less filtered sensory information reaching the cortex where it disrupts attention and contributes to sensory sensitivity. This literature motivates studies of mechanisms, functional consequences, and treatment of thalamocortical circuit dysfunction in ASD."},{"method":"Caregiver sensitive responsiveness (from the Manchester Assessment of Caregiver-Infant interaction [MACI]) predicted subsequent infant word tokens (i.e., amount of language, coded following the Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts [SALT]). Further, earlier infant Mean Length of Utterance (MLU; reflecting language complexity, also derived from SALT coding) predicted later caregiver MLU, even when controlling for variability in infant ages and clear within-domain temporal stability\/continuity in key measures (i.e., caregiver sensitive responsiveness and infant word tokens; and infant and caregiver MLU).","background":"While theory supports bidirectional effects between caregiver sensitivity and language use, and infant language acquisition-both caregiver-to-infant and also infant-to-caregiver effects-empirical research has chiefly explored the former unidirectional path. In the context of infants showing early signs of autism, we investigated prospective bidirectional associations with 6-min free-play interaction samples collected for 103 caregivers and their infants (mean age 12-months; and followed up 6-months later). We anticipated that measures of caregiver sensitivity\/language input and infant language would show within-domain temporal stability\/continuity, but also that there would be predictive associations from earlier caregiver input to subsequent child language, and vice versa.","conclusion":"These data add empirical support to theorization on how caregiver input can be both supportive of, and potentially influenced by, infant capacities, when infants have social-communication differences and\/or communication\/language delays suggestive of possible emerging autism."},{"method":"Here, we generated and characterized a tanc2 knockout allele in zebrafish. Loss of tanc2 increases the larval brain size and body length by promoting proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. We observed that the glutamatergic neuron population is significantly increased in tanc2 mutants while the GABAergic and the glycinergic neurons are not affected, suggesting that an excitatory\/inhibitory (E\/I) imbalance.","background":"Tanc2 is a large multi-domain postsynaptic scaffold protein mainly expressed in the brain. In humans, tanc2 mutations have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other related neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the role of tanc2 in neurodevelopment and in controlling behaviors are not fully understood.","conclusion":"Indeed, the tanc2 knockout larvae exhibited increase sleep. In adult zebrafish, the mutants display anxiolytic-behavior, reduced aggression, and impaired social preference. The alterations in these behaviors are phenotypically similar to the ASD patients carrying tanc2 mutations. Therefore, the tanc2 knockout allele could serve as a valuable model to further study the role of tanc2 in the nervous system."},{"method":"Therefore, following the gold-standard recommendations for measurement development outlined by the PROMIS&#xae; framework, we created the Sensory Observation Autism Rating scale (SOAR). We identified sensory behaviors across all primary domains and modalities through an extensive autism-sensory literature review and from focus groups with autism stakeholders. The initial item bank was then refined by an expert panel and through video coding five-minutes of free play from Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule assessments of 105 age- and gender-matched autistic and developmentally delayed children (aged 13-36&#x2009;months; 38 female). An additional 25% of the sample were double coded to investigate interrater reliability.","background":"Autistic people experience the sensory world differently, impacting behavior. First-hand accounts and group-based research have found that sensory differences impact a range of things including family life, anxiety, participation, and daily living. Early sensory differences are widely reported to be associated with a cascade of developmental difference, suggesting that early autism diagnosis and sensory mapping could enable the provision of supports to facilitate flourishing. However, appropriate measurement tools are not available as all rely on proxy report or are observation measures which include limited modalities or domains and require the administration of stimuli.","conclusion":"Observational data and expert review supported the reduction of the item bank to 37 items. We propose that the refined SOAR has excellent face and ecological validity, along with interrater reliability (Intraclass correlation&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.87-0.99). Following further data collection and refinement, SOAR has promise to fully characterize sensory behaviors in autistic children and indicate useful supports."},{"method":"We used natural language sampling to investigate the relationship between fine motor and speech intelligibility, mean length of utterance and conversational turns in MV and verbal autistic children between the ages of 4 and 7 while controlling for age and adaptive behavior.","background":"Fine motor skill is associated with expressive language outcomes in infants who have an autistic sibling and in young autistic children. Fewer studies have focused on school-aged children even though around 80% have motor impairments and 30% remain minimally verbal (MV) into their school years. Moreover, expressive language is not a unitary construct, but it is made up of components such as speech production, structural language, and social-pragmatic language use.","conclusion":"Fine motor skill predicted speech production, measured by percent intelligible utterances. Fine motor skill and adaptive behavior predicted structural language, measured by mean length of utterance in morphemes. Adaptive behavior, but not fine motor skill, predicted social-pragmatic language use measured by number of conversational turns. Simple linear regressions by group corrected for multiple comparisons showed that fine motor skill predicted intelligibility for MV but not verbal children. Fine motor skill and adaptive behavior predicted mean length of utterance for both MV and verbal children. These findings suggest that future studies should explore whether MV children may benefit from interventions targeting fine motor along with speech and language into their school years."},{"method":"In this article, we address what is known about the relative contributions of various types of genetic variation to ASD, consider the obstacles facing gene discovery in this complex disorder, and evaluate the common methodologies employed to address these issues, including linkage, molecular and array-based cytogenetics, and association strategies.

However, recent findings are now providing the first insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these syndromes and have begun to shed light on the allelic architecture of ASD.","conclusion":"Finally, we describe key advances in genomic technologies that are transforming all areas of human genetics and consider both the opportunities and challenges for autism research posed by these rapid changes."},{"method":"We made use of a large number of unrelated cases with autism spectrum disorders (approximately 350) and controls (approximately 420) and screened for rare exonic variants in SLC6A4 by a high-throughput method followed by sequencing.","background":"In the current study we explored the hypothesis that rare variants in SLC6A4 contribute to autism susceptibility and to rigid-compulsive behaviors in autism.","conclusion":"We observed no difference in the frequency of such variants in the two groups, irrespective of how we defined the rare variants. Furthermore, we did not observe an association of rare coding variants in SLC6A4 with rigid-compulsive traits scores in the cases. These results do not support a significant role for rare coding variants in SLC6A4 in autism spectrum disorders, nor do they support a significant role for SLC6A4 in rigid-compulsive traits in these disorders."},{"method":"We collected functional brain images and eye-gaze fixations from 9 individuals with FXS and 14 individuals with idiopathic ASD, as well as 15 typically developing (TD) individuals, while they performed a facial-emotion discrimination task.","background":"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most commonly known genetic disorder associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Overlapping features in these populations include gaze aversion, communication deficits, and social withdrawal. Although the association between FXS and ASD has been well documented at the behavioral level, the underlying neural mechanisms associated with the social\/emotional deficits in these groups remain unclear.","conclusion":"The FXS group showed a similar yet less aberrant pattern of gaze fixations compared with the ASD group. The FXS group also showed fusiform gyrus (FG) hypoactivation compared with the TD control group. Activation in FG was strongly and positively associated with average eye fixation and negatively associated with ASD characteristics in the FXS group. The FXS group displayed significantly greater activation than both the TD control and ASD groups in the left hippocampus (HIPP), left superior temporal gyrus (STG), right insula (INS), and left postcentral gyrus (PCG). These group differences in brain activation are important as they suggest unique underlying face-processing neural circuitry in FXS versus idiopathic ASD, largely supporting the hypothesis that ASD characteristics in FXS and idiopathic ASD reflect partially divergent impairments at the neural level, at least in FXS individuals without a co-morbid diagnosis of ASD."},{"method":"Differential expression (either higher or lower) for 9 of the 470 microRNAs was observed in our autism samples compared with controls. Potential target genes for these microRNAs were identified using computer tools, which included several autism susceptibility genes.","background":"To assess the feasibility and relevance of using lymphoblastoid cell lines to study the role of noncoding RNAs in the etiology of autism, we evaluated global expression profiling of 470 mature human microRNAs from six subjects with autism compared with six matched controls.","conclusion":"Our preliminary results indicate microRNAs should be considered and evaluated in the etiology of autism. In addition, analysis of this class of noncoding RNAs in lymphoblastoid cells has the potential to reveal at least a subset of brain-related microRNAs implicated in autism. Subsequently, this model system should allow for detection of complex subtle changes in susceptibility genes\/pathways contributing to autism."},{"method":"This study exemplifies a newly developed method for quantifying sensory testing metrics. Our novel sensory discrimination tests may provide (a) an effective means for biobehavioral assessment of deficits specific to autism and (b) an efficient and sensitive measure of change following treatment. The sensory discriminative capacity of ten subjects with autism and ten controls was compared both before and after short duration adapting stimuli. Specifically, vibrotactile amplitude discriminative capacity was obtained both in the presence and absence of 1 sec adapting stimuli that were delivered 1 sec prior to the comparison stimuli.","background":"Adults with autism exhibit inhibitory deficits that are often manifested in behavioral modifications, such as repetitive behaviors, and\/or sensory hyper-responsiveness. If such behaviors are the result of a generalized deficiency in inhibitory neurotransmission, then it stands to reason that deficits involving localized cortical-cortical interactions--such as in sensory discrimination tasks--could be detected and quantified.","conclusion":"Although adaptation had a pronounced effect on the amplitude discriminative capacity of the control subjects, little or no impact was observed on the sensory discriminative capacity of the subjects with autism. This lack of impact of the adapting stimuli on the responses of the subjects with autism was interpreted to be consistent with the reduced GABAergic-mediated inhibition described in previous reports. One significant aspect of this study is that the methods could prove to be a useful and efficient way to detect specific neural deficits and monitor the efficacy of pharmacological or behavioral treatments in autism."},{"method":"We developed a passive viewing task to measure aspects of visual attention in children with autism spectrum disorders and typically developing controls. Task stimuli included picture arrays that were matched for social and nonsocial content. Nonsocial content was balanced to include items related to circumscribed interests (e.g., trains) as well as more commonplace items (e.g., furniture). Discrete aspects of gaze behavior were quantified using eye-tracking technology.","background":"Although circumscribed interests are a hallmark characteristic of autism spectrum disorders, providing a means for quantifying their functional impairment has proven difficult.","conclusion":"Results indicate that visual attention in the autism group was more circumscribed (as indicated by the exploration of fewer images), more perseverative (as indicated by longer fixation times per image explored), and more detail oriented (as indicated by a greater number of discrete fixations on explored images). This pattern of results was similar for both social and object arrays. Within the autism group, overall severity of repetitive behavior symptoms correlated positively with exploration of object pictures and negatively with perseveration on social pictures. Results suggest that children with autism have a domain-general pattern of atypical visual attention that may represent an exaggeration of a typical attentional process and is related to a tendency to perseverate on images of interest and explore them in a more detail-oriented manner. Discrete measures of visual attention may therefore provide a reasonable means of quantifying aspects of the repetitive behavior phenotype in autism."},{"method":"From the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network, a surveillance project among several US populations, we obtained MB estimates among children born in 1994 and classified by 8 years of age as having: an ASD (n=1,626 total children from 11 sites; 50 born as part of an MB); CP (n=302 total children from 3 sites; 25 born as part of an MB); or ID (n=1,195 total children from 3 sites; 45 born as part of an MB). All three MB estimates were notably higher than age-adjusted expected estimates of naturally conceived MBs derived from 1971 US natality data.","background":"Since the 1970s, the prevalence of multiple births (MBs) in the United States has increased significantly. This has been attributed, in large part, to iatrogenic MBs resulting from infertility treatments that include ovulation stimulation. A past study has indicated that children from MBs have an increased prevalence of cerebral palsy (CP). Other studies also have suggested an association between MBs and intellectual disabilities (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs); however, results have been inconsistent.","conclusion":"However, when MB estimates from the ADDM Network were compared with expected MB estimates derived from 1994 natality data for the states corresponding to the relevant ADDM Network sites, we observed no association with ASDs (observed\/expected=1.08 [0.78-1.38]), a moderate, but not statistically significant association with ID (observed\/expected=1.34 [0.95-1.73]), and a strong association with CP (observed\/expected=2.96 [1.80-4.12]).

The goal of this study was to further explore the extent to which specific clinical features of autism are seen in SLI.","conclusion":"In the SLI group, 41% met autism or autism spectrum cut-offs for social or communication domains either on the ADI or ADOS or both. No relationship was found between the language deficits exhibited by the children with SLI and their scores on the ADI and ADOS. These findings contribute to evidence that there is some overlap in social and communicative deficits between autism and SLI, supporting the view that autism and SLI share etiologic factors. This continuum of pathology between SLI and autism appears to range from structural language abnormalities as seen in individuals with SLI to individuals with SLI with both structural and social abnormalities to individuals with autism with pragmatic impairment and language abnormalities."},{"method":"In this eye tracking study, looking time and pupil dilation were investigated during the presentation of upright and inverted faces in preschool children with ASD and typically developing preschoolers.","background":"Previous research has found that in typically developing individuals, behavioral performance declines and electrophysiological brain responses are altered when the face is inverted. Such effects are generally attributed to disruption of configural information. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been found to show less pronounced inversion effects, a result in line with the view that featural processing of faces is enhanced in ASD. No study has determined if, or how, such local bias is reflected in the eye movements used in face observation.","conclusion":"On average, both children with ASD and typically developing children looked less at the face and the eye areas during inverted presentations than during upright presentations. Nevertheless, individuals with ASD had a stronger tendency than typically developing children to look at the same face features during upright and inverted presentations, which is suggestive of a local bias. Pupil dilation, reflecting increased processing load, was larger for inverted than upright faces in the ASD group only, and pupillary inversion effects were stronger in ASD than in typically developing children."},{"method":"Internal consistency (0.91-0.97), test-retest reliability (0.84-0.97), interrater reliability (0.76 and 0.95) and convergent validity with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule as well as the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and Social Communication Questionnaire (0.35-0.58) were satisfactory to good.","background":"The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) is a quantitative measure of autistic traits in 4- to 18-year-olds, which has been used in behavior-genetic, epidemiological and intervention studies. The US standardization demonstrated a single-factor structure and good to excellent psychometric properties. The cross-cultural validity of the German adaptation of the parent-report SRS in a sample of N=1,436 children and adolescents: 838 typically developing and 527 clinical participants (160 with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)) was examined.","conclusion":"The SRS total score discriminated between ASD and other mental disorders. SRS scores proved to be sufficiently independent of general psychopathology. Principal component analyses yielded single-factor solutions for the normative and clinical subsamples. In addition, construct validity was ensured by consistent correlations with the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, the Child Behavior Checklist and the Junior Temperament and Character Inventory. Normative SRS total scores for girls and boys as well as values for ASD were lower in the German sample, while scores for conduct disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity\/conduct disorder combined were higher. Generally, cross-cultural validity of the SRS seems to be sufficiently assured for a large European sample. However, some discrepancies regarding SRS normative and clinical raw score distributions, reliability and validity findings are critically discussed."},{"method":"Thus, we took the alternative approach of examining 14 prominent dopamine pathway candidate genes for detailed study by genotyping 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms.","background":"Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a triad of complications. Autistic individuals display significant disturbances in language and reciprocal social interactions, combined with repetitive and stereotypic behaviors. Prevalence studies suggest that autism is more common than originally believed, with recent estimates citing a rate of one in 150. Although multiple genetic linkage and association studies have yielded multiple suggestive genes or chromosomal regions, a specific risk locus has yet to be identified and widely confirmed. Because many etiologies have been suggested for this complex syndrome, we hypothesize that one of the difficulties in identifying autism genes is that multiple genetic variants may be required to significantly increase the risk of developing autism.","conclusion":"Although we did observe a nominally significant association for rs2239535 (P=0.008) on chromosome 20, single-locus analysis did not reveal any results as significant after correction for multiple comparisons. No significant interaction was identified when Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction was employed to test specifically for multilocus effects. Although genome-wide linkage scans in autism have provided support for linkage to various loci along the dopamine pathway, our study does not provide strong evidence of linkage or association to any specific gene or combination of genes within the pathway. These results demonstrate that common genetic variation within the tested genes located within this pathway at most play a minor to moderate role in overall autism pathogenesis."},{"method":"Joint attention may be best defined in terms of an information-processing system that begins to develop by 4-6 months of age. This system integrates the parallel processing of internal information about one's own visual attention with external information about the visual attention of other people. This type of joint encoding of information about self and other attention requires the activation of a distributed anterior and posterior cortical attention network. Genetic regulation, in conjunction with self-organizing behavioral activity, guides the development of functional connectivity in this network. With practice in infancy the joint processing of self-other attention becomes automatically engaged as an executive function.","background":"The impaired development of joint attention is a cardinal feature of autism. Therefore, understanding the nature of joint attention is central to research on this disorder.","conclusion":"It can be argued that this executive joint attention is fundamental to human learning as well as the development of symbolic thought, social cognition and social competence throughout the life span. One advantage of this parallel and distributed-processing model of joint attention is that it directly connects theory on social pathology to a range of phenomena in autism associated with neural connectivity, constructivist and connectionist models of cognitive development, early intervention, activity-dependent gene expression and atypical ocular motor control."},{"method":"To determine any underlying abnormalities in the critically important GABAergic system, the rate-limiting GABA synthesizing enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) type 65 was measured via in situ hybridization histochemistry in dentate somata. GAD65 mRNA labeling revealed two distinct subpopulations of neurons in adult control and autism postmortem brains: small-sized cells (about 10-12 microm in diameter, presumed interneurons) and larger-sized neurons (about 18-20 microm in diameter, likely feedback to inferior olivary neurons).","background":"The laterally positioned dentate nuclei lie in a key position in the cerebellum to receive input from Purkinje cells in the lateral cerebellar hemisphere participating in both motor and cognitive functions. Although neuropathology of the four cerebellar nuclei using Nissl staining has been qualitatively reported in children and adults with autism, surprisingly the dentate nuclei appeared less affected despite reported reductions in Purkinje cells in the posterolateral cerebellar hemisphere.","conclusion":"A mean 51% reduction in GAD65 mRNA levels was found in the larger labeled cells in the autistic group compared with the control group (P=0.009; independent t-test) but not in the smaller cell subpopulation. This suggests a disturbance in the intrinsic cerebellar circuitry in the autism group potentially interfering with the synchronous firing of inferior olivary neurons, and the timing of Purkinje cell firing and inputs to the dentate nuclei. Disturbances in critical neural substrates within these key circuits could disrupt afferents to motor and\/or cognitive cerebral association areas in the autistic brain likely contributing to the marked behavioral consequences characteristic of autism."},{"method":"Salivary cortisol values for diurnal rhythms and response to stress in children with and without autism were compared to parent-report measures of child stress, the Stress Survey Schedule (SSS), sensory functioning, Short Sensory Profile (SSP), and Parenting Stress Index.","background":"Previously we reported that children with autism show significant variability in cortisol. The current investigation was designed to extend these findings by exploring plausible relationships between cortisol and psychological measures of stress and sensory functioning.","conclusion":"In autism, a negative relationship between morning cortisol and the SSS revealed that higher observed symptoms of stress were related to lower cortisol. Lower cortisol is seen in conditions of chronic stress and in social situations characterized by unstable social relationships. Sensory sensitivity painted a more complicated picture, in that some aspects of SSP were associated with higher while others were associated with lower cortisol. We propose that increased sensory sensitivity may enhance the autistic child's susceptibility to the influence of zeitgeibers reflected in variable cortisol secretion. Evening cortisol was positively associated with SSS such that the higher the level of evening cortisol, the higher the child's parent-reported daily stress, especially to changes, such as in daily routine. Regarding the response to stress, the psychological and parent variables did not differentiate the groups; rather, discrete subgroups of cortisol responders and nonresponders were revealed in both the autism and neurotypical children. The results support a complex interplay between physiological and behavioral stress and sensory sensitivity in autism and plausible developmental factors influencing stress reactivity across the groups."},{"method":"This study examined adult outcome for 41 such individuals (38 men and 3 women) originally identified through an epidemiological survey of autism in Utah.

Outcome measures included standardized assessments of diagnostic status, cognitive ability, and adaptive behavior. Additional information collected concerned demographic variables, indicators of independence, social relationships, medical and psychiatric conditions, and social service use.","background":"Previous studies found substantial variability in adult outcome for people with autism whose cognitive functioning was within the near-average and average ranges.","conclusion":"Outcomes for this sample were better than outcomes described in previous work on individuals with similar cognitive functioning. For example, half of the participants were rated as \"Very Good\" or \"Good\" on a global outcome measure. As in previous studies, there was considerable variability in measured cognitive ability over time. Over half of the sample had large gains or losses of cognitive ability of greater than 1 standard deviation. Cognitive gain was associated with better outcome, as was better adaptive functioning. While all participants had baseline IQs in the nonimpaired range, there was limited evidence to support the use of other early childhood variables to predict adult outcome."},{"method":"Twenty-six able adults with ASD and 26 intelligence quotient-matched typically developing controls completed two computerized tests of face and object discrimination. In task 1, the first picture (faces or cars) in a pair was presented as quickly as 40 msec to test holistic processing. In task 2, the decision was whether pairs of faces or houses had been altered in terms of the features or the distance between the features (the second-order configural properties).","background":"The nature and extent of face-processing impairments in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain contentious. The aim of this research study is to assess the face- and object-processing performance of individuals with ASD compared with typically developing controls. Our hypothesis was that individuals with ASD would be significantly impaired on tests of face processing but show intact object processing. More specifically, we tested two competing hypotheses to explain face-processing deficits: holistic hypothesis; second-order configural hypothesis.","conclusion":"Individuals with ASD were impaired on all tests of face processing but showed intact object processing and the pattern of findings favored the holistic hypothesis. The heterogeneous pattern of performance in the clinical group showed that some individuals with ASD perform similarly to typically developing individuals in their face-processing skills, whereas others are more accurate in object processing compared with face processing."},{"method":"Data from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) collection were analyzed for all children who met strict criteria for autism per the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and who had been genotyped for the 677 C to T MTHFR polymorphism (n=147).

We hypothesized that children with autism who are homozygous for the MTHFR 677 T allele (TT) and, to a lesser extent those with the CT variant, would exhibit more behavioral problems and\/or more severe problematic behaviors than homozygous wild-type (CC) individuals because of difficulties in effectively converting 5,10-MTHF to 5-MTHF.","conclusion":"Exploratory results indicated four behaviors from the ADI-R that were more common and problematic (95% CI) among those with at least one copy of the T allele as compared to homozygous wild-type individuals: direct gaze, current complex body movements, a history of self-injurious behavior, and current overactivity (ORs=2.72, 2.33, 2.12, 2.47, respectively).

Recent studies have attempted to reduce the \"noise\" in genetic and other biological data by reducing the phenotypic heterogeneity of the sample population.","conclusion":"Our combined cluster analyses suggest optimal division of the autistic probands into four phenotypic clusters based on similarity of symptom severity across the 123 selected item scores. One cluster is characterized by severe language deficits, while another exhibits milder symptoms across the domains. A third group possesses a higher frequency of savant skills while the fourth group exhibited intermediate severity across all domains.

However, executive impairments have not always been easy to identify consistently and so novel \"ecologically valid\" tests have been designed which tap into real-life scenarios that are relevant to and representative of everyday behavior. One characteristic of many of these tasks is that they present the participant with an \"ill-structured\" or \"open-ended\" situation. Here, we investigated the possibility that tasks with greater degrees of open-endedness might prove more sensitive to detecting executive impairment in autism.","conclusion":"Group differences were found on half of the tasks, with the greatest degree of impairment detected on the more open-ended tasks. The ASD group also performed more poorly on a simple control condition of a task. Detailed consideration of task performance suggested that the ASD group tended to create fewer spontaneous strategies and exhibit more idiosyncratic behavior, which particularly disadvantaged them on the more open-ended tasks. These kinds of behaviors have been reported in studies of neurological patients with frontal lobe involvement, prima facie suggesting a link between the scientific fields. However, we suggest that this behavior might equally result from a poor understanding of the implicit demands made by the experimenter in open-ended test situations, due to the socio-communicative difficulties of these children."},{"method":"A new test of social and narrative cognition, the Moral Dilemmas Film Task, was developed to probe individuals' spontaneous understanding of naturalistic film scenes. Twenty-eight individuals with ASC and 28 neurotypical controls, matched for age, sex, and IQ, watched four short emotionally charged film clips each depicting a moral dilemma, and were asked to write about what they had seen.","background":"People with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) have difficulties with mentalizing, empathy, and narrative comprehension.","conclusion":"Individuals with ASC produced significantly shorter film-based narratives and showed a smaller bias for mental states over objects in their narratives than controls. A significant correlation was found between verbal IQ and the level of mentalizing in film narratives for the ASC group, but not the control group, while the reverse pattern was found with a measure of self-reported cognitive and affective empathy. These results suggest that to the extent that both groups succeed in viewing moral dilemmas in terms of mental content, they do so in different ways, with individuals with ASC using verbal scaffolding to increase their ability to draw meaning from social scenes. The well-established empathy deficit in ASC extends to spontaneous interpretation of moral dilemmas. This new film task has the potential to assay different aspects of how the social world is represented differently in ASC, including during moral comprehension."},{"method":"We conducted a population-based study to explore whether fathers, or mothers, of children with ASD are over-represented in fields requiring highly technical skills. Subjects included 284 children with ASD and 659 gender-matched controls, born in 1994 in the San Francisco Bay Area. Parental occupation and industry were abstracted verbatim from birth certificates. Engineering, computer programming, and science were examined as highly technical occupations. To limit bias by parental socio-economic status, we selected a referent group of occupations that seemed professionally similar but of a less technical nature. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by logistic regression, adjusting for parental age, education, and child race.","background":"A previous study reported that fathers of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) were more likely to work as engineers, requiring \"systemizing skills,\" and suggesting a distinct phenotype, but alternatively this may have been related to selection biases.","conclusion":"Mothers of cases were somewhat more likely to work in hi-tech occupations (6.7%) than mothers of controls (4.0%, P=0.07), but little difference was observed among fathers, nor for engineering separately. Compared to parents in other \"white collar\" occupations, the adjusted OR for highly technical occupations among mothers was 2.5 (95% CI: 1.2-5.3) and among fathers was 1.3 (95% CI: 0.79-2.1), with no evidence of a joint effect observed.

Multiple lines of evidence, including genetic and imaging studies, suggest that the ACC and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) system may be affected in autism. The benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA(A) receptor complex is an important target for pharmacotherapy and has important clinical implications.","conclusion":"Compared to controls, the autistic group had significant decreases in the mean density of GABA(A) receptors in the supragranular (46.8%) and infragranular (20.2%) layers of the ACC and in the density of benzodiazepine binding sites in the supragranular (28.9%) and infragranular (16.4%) lamina [corrected]. These findings suggest that in the autistic group this downregulation of both benzodiazepine sites and GABA(A) receptors in the ACC may be the result of increased GABA innervation and\/or release disturbing the delicate excitation\/inhibition balance of principal neurons as well as their output to key limbic cortical targets. Such disturbances likely underlie the core alterations in socio-emotional behaviors in autism."},{"method":"High-functioning children (age 8-13 years) and adults with autism (age 17-53 years) and matched controls were tested in a facial prototype formation task that has been used to test prototype formation abilities in typically developing infants and adults [Strauss, 1979]. Participants were familiarized to a series of faces depicting subtle variations in the spatial distance of facial features, and were then given a forced choice familiarity test between the mean prototype and the mode prototype.","background":"Prototype formation is a critical skill for category learning. Research suggests that individuals with autism may have a deficit in prototype formation of some objects; however, results are mixed. This study used a natural category, faces, to further examine prototype formation in high-functioning individuals with autism.","conclusion":"Overall, individuals in the autism group were significantly less likely to select the mean prototype face. Even though the children with autism showed this difference in prototype formation, this pattern was driven primarily by the adults, because the adults with autism were approximately four times less likely to select the mean prototype than were the control adults. These results provide further evidence that individuals with autism have difficulty abstracting subtle spatial information that is necessary not only for the formation of a mean prototype, but also for categorizing faces and objects."},{"method":"Mapping of the inversion breakpoints by FISH has localized the inversion to the region spanning approximately 99-108.75 Mb of chromosome 7. The proximal breakpoint has the potential to disrupt either the coding sequence or regulatory regions of a number of cytochrome P450 genes while the distal region falls in a relative gene desert. Copy number variant analysis of the breakpoint regions detected no duplication or deletion that could clearly be associated with disease status. Association analysis in our autism data set using single nucleotide polymorphisms located near the breakpoints showed no significant association with proximal breakpoint markers, but has identified markers near the distal breakpoint ( approximately 108-110 Mb) with significant associations to autism.","background":"Chromosomal breaks and rearrangements have been observed in conjunction with autism and autistic spectrum disorders. A chromosomal inversion has been previously reported in autistic siblings, spanning the region from approximately 7q22.1 to 7q31. This family is distinguished by having multiple individuals with autism and associated disabilities. The region containing the inversion has been strongly implicated in autism by multiple linkage studies, and has been particularly associated with language defects in autism as well as in other disorders with language components.","conclusion":"The chromosomal abnormality in this family strengthens the case for an autism susceptibility gene in the chromosome 7q22-31 region and targets a candidate region for further investigation."},{"method":"Cortical folding was assessed with the gyrification index, which was calculated on high resolution anatomic MR images.","background":"In order to disentangle genetic and environmental contributions to cortical anomalies in children with autism, we investigated cortical folding patterns in a cohort of 14 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs who displayed a range of phenotypic discordance for autism, and 14 typically developing community controls.","conclusion":"We found that the cortical folding patterns across most lobar regions of the cerebral cortex was highly discordant within MZ twin pairs. In addition, children with autism and their co-twins exhibited increased cortical folding in the right parietal lobe, relative to age- and gender-matched typical developing children. Increased folding in the right parietal lobe was associated with more symptoms of autism for co-twins. Finally, the robust association between cortical folding and IQ observed in typical children was not observed in either children with autism or their co-twins. These findings, which contribute to our understanding of the limits of genetic liability in autism, suggest that anomalies in the structural integrity of the cortex in this PDD may disrupt the association between cortical folding and intelligence that has been reported in typical individuals, and may account, in part, for the deficits in visual spatial attention and in social cognition that have been reported in children with autism."},{"method":"We have now studied the effect of C57BL\/6 and BALB\/c haploid sets of genes on this behaviour by comparing EPM and OF variables of C57BL\/6 and BALB\/c versus C57BL\/6 x BALB\/c F1 hybrids (B6CBF1) and chimeric C57BL\/6 x BALB\/c (CHIM) mice. CHIM mice were made by embryo aggregation and the chimerism degree of their brain was inferred from coat black\/white distribution. Discriminant analysis of EPM and OF factorial scores of C57BL\/6, BALB\/c and CHIM mice showed that CHIM mice with an exceeding (&gt; or =80%) C57BL\/6 or BALB\/c coat component had behaviours similar to those of the predominant strain, whereas CHIM mice with intermediate chimerism differed from both inbred strains. Additional MANOVA analysis showed that the anxiety behaviour of CHIM mice with intermediate chimerism was similar to that of B6CBF1 mice as for factors not describing the inbred strains, including a motor activity mostly limited to protected areas, with attempts to approach the anxiogenic areas while processing\/storing the external information.","background":"In a previous study on anxiety-related behaviours of the genetically and behaviourally distant inbred mouse strains C57BL\/6 and BALB\/c using the Elevated plus-maze (EPM) and Open-field (OF) apparatuses, we identified a number of variables, the factorial scores of which were grouped by principal component analysis (PCA) into factors specifically describing each inbred strain.","conclusion":"We conclude that the balanced presence of both C57BL\/6 and BALB\/c genetic backgrounds, either when carried by the same cell or by different cells, gives rise to a novel stress coping strategy described by factors different from those of the inbred strains."},{"method":"Rats with lesions of the dorsolateral striatum were found to be impaired in the acquisition of this task, as compared to rats with either dorsomedial striatal or sham lesions.

In contrast, animals with lesions of the dorsomedial striatum did not show an impairment in acquisition of the present task, but had slightly higher rates of responding during CS- presentations.","background":"In the present experiment, the effects of neurotoxic lesions (quinolinic acid) of the dorsolateral or dorsomedial striatum were investigated on a simple instrumental discrimination task (CS+\/CS-).","conclusion":"It is argued that the poor acquisition and low response rates observed in animals with dorsolateral striatal lesions reflect a failure in stimulus-response learning, while the performance of animals with dorsomedial striatal lesions may have been the result of an increase in overall activity rate."},{"method":"Olfactory behavior of wild-type (WT) and apoE-deficient (apoE KO) mice was assessed by using three standard olfactory tests: (1) the buried food pellet (BFP) test; (2) the odor choice (OC) test; and (3) the odor cued taste avoidance (OCTA) test.","background":"Apolipoprotein E (apoE), a lipid transporting protein, has been shown to play a vital role in nerve repair and remodeling. Since the olfactory system is in a continuous state of remodeling, the present study tested the hypothesis that apoE is required for normal functioning of the olfactory system.","conclusion":"ApoE KO mice performed poorly in all the three tests as compared to WT mice, although they learned the tasks at a rate comparable to WT mice. ApoE KO mice had a significantly longer latency to find the buried pellet than WT mice. In the OC experiment, apoE KO mice did not differentiate water from an odorant solution. Furthermore, in the OCTA test the apoE KO mice were significantly less successful than WT mice at avoiding water containing an odorant and a bad tastant. These data demonstrate that apoE deficiency in apoE KO mice leads to a deficit in olfactory function, suggesting an important role for apoE in the olfactory system."},{"method":"In experiment 1, animals treated with 7-NI (25, 50 and 100mg\/kg), morphine (40 mg\/kg) or morphine (40 mg\/kg) plus 7-NI (25, 50 or 100mg\/kg) were placed in an actimeter for 3h.

Dizocilpine (0.03-0.3 mg\/kg, i.p.), given acutely, disrupted performance by increasing the number of errors equally across both genotypes. At asymptotic performance of a differential reinforcement of low response rate operant task (DRL), acute dizocilpine (0.03-0.3 mg\/kg) impaired performance, but no differences between genotypes were observed. However, dizocilpine (0.1 mg\/kg), given repeatedly during acquisition of a signalled-DRL15\" task, retarded acquisition in tPA-\/- but not WT mice.

This supports a role for tPA in modification of the NMDA receptor, although absence of tPA does not have consequences for all forms of NMDA-dependent mediated learning."},{"method":"Dams received an unpredictable 90-min duration contention stress between gestational day E17 and E20. Locomotion and learning ability were examined in offsprings between day P24 and P29 using actimetry, spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze, delayed alternation in the T-maze, and passive avoidance.","background":"Stress during pregnancy results in neurochemical and behavioral alterations observed throughout adulthood and aging. We here examined the impact of prenatal stress (PS) on cognitive functions in juvenile-4-week-old-rats, focusing on putative sex differences.","conclusion":"Both male and female PS rats showed increased activity. In the Y-maze, diminished spontaneous alternation (males: -20%; females: -29%) were seen for PS rats compared to non-PS rats. The number of arm entries was unchanged among groups. In the T-maze, PS rats failed to perform delayed alternation, as shown by equal time spent and number of entries in both the novel and previously explored arms. In the passive avoidance test, PS resulted in significant impairments for female offspring only of both step-through latency and percentage of animals to criterion. PS thus induced severe learning impairments affecting both short-term and long-term memories that could be observed early in lifetime, in 4-week-old, juvenile rats. In addition, marked sex differences were evidenced, particularly in the passive avoidance response that may reflect differential developmental neuroadaptations in precise brain structures."},{"method":"In the present study, we investigated if the CMS procedure, in our laboratory, would cause decreased sucrose intake and, also, give sleep changes similar to what is found in depressed patients.","background":"Depression in humans is associated with sleep abnormalities of three types: altered rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, fragmented sleep, and reduced delta sleep. In an animal model of depression, chronic exposure to mild stressors (CMS, e.g. periods of soiled cage, reversed light\/dark cycle, grouped housing, food and\/or water deprivation) causes behavioral and hormonal changes which, in humans, often are associated with depression. In the CMS model, a reduced sucrose intake has been defined as one of the core symptoms of depression, anhedonia, although this finding is not consistent among various laboratories.","conclusion":"Exposure to CMS decreased sucrose intake in our rats. The largest effect was obtained after 2 weeks of the stress protocol. CMS rats spent more time in REM sleep and showed more fragmented sleep compared to their baseline recording, while there were no changes in the control rats. Increased sleep fragmentation in CMS rats was particularly evident by increased number of arousals, and increased REM sleep and slow-wave-sleep-1 (SWS-1) episodes. The duration of sleep stage episodes was decreased. The amount of slow-wave-sleep-2 (SWS-2) was not decreased, however SWS-2 in percent of total SWS was reduced. Correlation analysis showed that animals that had less consumption of sucrose spent more time in REM sleep and had increased number of REM sleep episodes.

Rats were then trained for 14 days with their previously non-preferred forelimb (and the forced-use limb) on a unilateral pellet retrieval task.","background":"Unilateral forelimb sensorimotor cortex lesions in adult rats produce a compensatory hyper-reliance on the forelimb ipsilateral to the lesion and temporally related glial and neural plasticity in the contralateral homotopic cortex. Recently, we found that these lesions enhance acquisition of a motor skills task with the ipsilateral, non-impaired, forelimb in comparison to shams. This effect might be related to a denervation-induced facilitation of neuroplastic changes in the motor cortex opposite the lesion and\/or to the lesion-induced hyper-reliance on the non-impaired forelimb.","conclusion":"Compared to shams, transections produced a greater acquisition rate and asymptotic performance level on the task. Forced-use improved reaching performance relative to controls, but this effect was less enduring than the improvements produced by transections alone. The addition of forced-use to transections did not further enhance performance. These findings suggest that denervation-induced changes are likely to be a major contributor to the enhanced learning observed after unilateral sensorimotor cortex lesions."},{"method":"In the present study, we show that complete disuse of the impaired forelimb during the first post-operative week renders surviving tissue vulnerable to later overuse of the same limb, in effect extending the window of vulnerability in which use-dependent exaggeration of brain injury can occur.","background":"Extreme over-reliance on the impaired forelimb following unilateral lesions of the forelimb representation area of the rat sensorimotor cortex (FL-SMC) leads to exaggeration of injury when overuse is begun during the first week, but not later periods, after injury.

Also, HG rats had shorter steps. The data also highlight a fast adaptation to normal gravity since all the locomotor parameters returned to normal values within 3 weeks. The locomotor modifications may be seen as the persistence of a hypergravity-induced posturo-locomotor adaptation in the centrifuge and\/or to more functional changes of sensorimotor systems.

Intra-cerebroventricular treatment with MTII (a MC3\/4-R agonist) significantly decreased food intake for up to 24 h after treatment, and SHU9119 reversed these suppressive effects between 4 and 24 h after treatment, a similar time course to that observed when SHU9119 was administered alone.","background":"Siberian hamsters accumulate fat reserves in long photoperiods, but show a long-term decrease in food intake and body weight when exposed to a short winter photoperiod.

In addition, we examined whether cerebral neuropeptide Y (NPY), an orexigenic neurotransmitter reported to mediate AMPH anorexia, was involved in the anorectic action of D1\/D2 co-administration. Our result revealed that injection of NPY antisense into brain could modify the anorectic action of repeated D1\/D2 agonists, indicating the involvement of NPY.

Our results reinforce the view that the brain plays a functional part in activating planarian motility."},{"method":"Here we studied social interaction in young adult (3 months) and aged (30 months old) rats using an established test system for anxiety-related behaviour. Using Fos expression as a marker of neuronal activation, we aimed to investigate whether age-related differences in anxiety would be reflected by changes in neuronal activity in brain regions known to be sensitive to fear- and anxiety-related stimuli.","background":"There is evidence that ageing both in humans and animals is accompanied by changes in emotional behaviour. Behavioural studies in rats point to an increase in emotional reactivity and\/or anxiety-related behaviour with age.","conclusion":"Aged rats spent significantly less time (75%) in active social interaction than young rats, without concomitant changes in general locomotor activity. Social interaction enhanced Fos expression both in young and aged rats in several anxiety-related brain areas. Lower Fos response in aged versus young rats was noted in the dorsomedial, dorsolateral and ventrolateral part of the periaqueductal grey, the medial and basolateral amygdala and parvocellular region of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, while no differences in Fos expression were observed in the other regions examined, including the hippocampus, septum or locus coeruleus. These results demonstrate age-related reduction in social interaction, indicative of enhanced anxiety-related behaviour in aged rats. However, since the supposedly increased anxiety level was not accompanied by augmented Fos expression in any of the key brain areas of the fear\/anxiety circuitry known to be activated by anxiogenic stimuli, it is suggested that reduced social interaction does not reflect enhanced anxiety in aged rats."},{"method":"In saline-treated rats both parameters of motor activity were unaffected by ELF-MF irradiation. The rats pre-exposed to ELF-MF and injected with the lowest dose of AMPH showed the same locomotor activity as control animals, while their stereotypic behaviour was significantly elevated. ELF-MF in combination with AMPH at higher doses significantly enhanced motor activity when compared with values obtained in both control and combined experiments with the lowest dose of the drug.","background":"The effects of short-term (15 min) pre-exposure of rats to extremely low-frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF, 50 Hz, 6 mT) on their motor (locomotor and stereotypic) activity induced by d-amphetamine sulphate (AMPH) at different doses (0.5, 1.5 and 4.5mg\/kg, i.p.) were studied in the open field test.","conclusion":"However, only combined locomotor effect at the middle dose of AMPH was significantly greater than those observed in corresponding experiments with AMPH alone. These results demonstrate that acute short-term exposure to ELF-MF is able to modify a motor activity in dependence on the extent of AMPH-induced neurotransmitter imbalance."},{"method":"In the present study, we investigated the effect of peripheral and central NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 in visceral hypersensitivity. In an animal model of colorectal distension (CRD), administration of both intrathecal MK-801 (1.5 nmol) and intraperitoneal MK-801 (0.15 mg\/kg) completely abolished the CRD-induced visceral hypersensitivity of noxious and innocuous stimuli.","background":"N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) is known to be involved in the transmission of nociceptive information.","conclusion":"Thus, the results from this experiment demonstrate the efficacy of MK-801 in blocking the visceral hypersensitivity mediated by central and peripheral mechanisms."},{"method":"In the present study, the effects of prenatal nicotine exposure (infused at 6mg\/kg\/day) and maternal withdraw during neonatal development, was examined in Sprague-Dawley rats on an array of behavioral tasks during different stages of ontogenesis. Offspring of both genders were monitored for exploratory, locomotor, and novelty-seeking activity, anxiety, and learning and memory in an active-avoidance task.","background":"Maternal tobacco use during pregnancy adversely affects prenatal and postnatal growth and increases the risk of developmental and behavioral deficits in children and adolescents.","conclusion":"Nicotine-exposed animals showed growth retardation, hyperactivity, and poor adaptation in a new environment, increased level of anxiety during the early adolescent period, and robust cognitive deficits in early adulthood. In addition, the deficits were generally more severe in the female nicotine-exposed offspring. Cross-fostering also revealed that while maternal behavior and nicotine withdraw did not affect postnatal somatic growth retardation or cognitive ability of the offspring; measures of exploration and adaptation in a new environment were impacted during the post-weanling and early adolescence period. Nicotine-exposed offspring, and the saline-treated offspring cross-fostered to nicotine-exposed mothers, showed higher measures of anxiety in the elevated plus-maze and decreased novelty-seeking behavior on the hole-board apparatus. These studies demonstrated that prenatal nicotine exposure produced significant long-term developmental and behavioral teratogenic effects. The study design provides a model system for studying the mechanism(s) responsible for the decline in central nervous system function following prenatal nicotine exposure, as well as that of other neurological and behavioral teratogens during pregnancy."},{"method":"In the present study, a novel method of producing a focal ischaemic lesion by intracortical microinjection of endothelin-1 (ET-1) was compared with excitotoxic (microinjection of quinolinic acid) and mechanical (aspiration) lesioning procedures. Lesions were unilateral and were targeted at the forelimb representation zone in sensorimotor cortex.","background":"Different methods of inducing experimental brain lesions can result in distinct neuropathological sequelae. This could be of consequence in attempts to establish animal models of recovery of function following stroke, as differences in the progression of experimental lesion pathology may have an impact on the magnitude and rate of recovery of function observable with any particular lesioning method.","conclusion":"It was found that all three types of lesion had an essentially identical effect with regard to reaching accuracy in a paw-reaching task. All lesioned animals displayed a similar, significant long-term deficit in reaching accuracy and limited degree of recovery relative to sham animals. Off-line analysis of the performance of animals during post-lesion week 9 indicated that animals in each lesion group also displayed a similar deficit. The current results suggest that the spontaneous behavioural consequences of a unilateral lesion of FL in the rat appear to be independent of the nature of lesion production. However, the increased face validity of an ET-1-induced lesion, coupled with the ease of control of lesion placement and extent offered by this technique make for a potentially important animal model for research into drug effects on recovery of function following stroke."},{"method":"We now report that cats with equivalent unilateral lesions sustained during the first postnatal week (P1-4), or at the end of the first postnatal month (P27-30), orient to stimuli presented in the contralesional field as proficiently as to stimuli introduced into the ipsilesional field.","background":"We know that cats with bilateral lesions of occipital visual cortical areas 17, 18 and 19 sustained during the first postnatal week exhibit a modest level of sparing of the ability to re-orient head and eyes to new stimuli relative to cats that incurred equivalent lesions in adulthood.","conclusion":"Moreover, levels of proficiency are indistinguishable from those exhibited by intact cats. Thus, the sparing is greater following unilateral lesions than following bilateral lesions, and the level of sparing approaches completeness. The difference between the bilateral and unilateral lesion results suggests types of pathway reorganizations that may emerge as a result of unilateral occipital lesions. We postulate that the greater sparing is based on modifications in both excitatory and inhibitory circuitry linked to the intact hemisphere, and we provide a framework for future investigations that should be relevant to the comprehension of the repercussions of early unilateral and bilateral lesions sustained by monkeys and humans, which also show more robust residual vision following early relative to later damage of occipital cortex."},{"method":"Therefore, we compared non-habituated motor behaviour of PPTg lesioned rats with sham lesioned rats under spontaneous, dizocilpine (MK-801) (0.1 and 0.16 mg\/kg) and dl-amphetamine (1 and 2 mg\/kg) conditions. In order to analyse exploratory behaviour only, session-times were limited to 5 min after placing the rats in an open field. The exploratory motor activity was compared to the motor activity obtained in rats habituated to the environment.","background":"The pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) as part of the mesencephalic locomotor region is discussed to be involved in motor activity. In this study, we examined whether the PPTg plays a role in exploratory behaviour.","conclusion":"PPTg lesions had no effect on spontaneous exploratory behaviour, but it intensified the enhanced motor activity induced by MK-801. However, PPTg lesions blocked the enhanced exploratory behaviour, i.e. horizontal activity, rearing and centre activity induced by amphetamine. These data indicate that the PPTg is involved in behaviour driven by the dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems, when the animals are in a particular motivational state, e.g. a state that increases motor activity for itself, like exploration. This is underlined by the finding that animals exploring their environment show a higher motor activity even after multiple sessions, than animals familiar to the environment."},{"method":"By means of the method of acute TRP depletion, plasma TRP levels can be reduced in a reversible way in both humans and rats. In the present study a TRP-free protein-carbohydrate mixture was used to investigate the behavioral effects of lowering TRP and 5-HT concentrations in adult male rats. These animals were tested in models of anxiety (open field, home cage emergence test), depression (forced swimming test) and cognition (object recognition test and Morris water escape test). The TRP-free protein-carbohydrate mixture substantially reduced the ratio TRP\/SigmaLNAA within 2 and 4 h by 75 and 60%, respectively.","background":"One manner to study the role of serotonin (5-HT) in behavioral functions is through nutritional manipulation of its precursor tryptophan (TRP).","conclusion":"It was found that 4 h after administration, the treatment did not affect anxiety-related behavior nor did it cause depressive-like behavior. Also, no treatment effect was found on spatial learning performance in a Morris water escape test. On the other hand, performance in an object recognition test was clearly impaired after TRP depletion. Taken together, these data suggest that acute lowered central 5-HT levels are not associated with changes in affective behavior (i.e. anxiety and depression), but do impair object memory in adult rats."},{"method":"In the present study, different groups of rats were trained on two schedules (FR 1 and FR 5) and weights were placed on the levers 2 days each week. In the FR 5 studies, two different weights were used (32 or 64 g), while three different weights were used in the FR 1 studies (32, 64, or 96 g). After baseline training, rats received intra-accumbens injections of either 6-OHDA to deplete DA, or ascorbate vehicle as the control.","background":"It has been suggested that depletions of accumbens dopamine (DA) make rats more sensitive to work-related response costs. One way of controlling work costs in operant tasks has been to use fixed-ratio (FR) schedules with different ratio requirements. In addition to using ratio requirements to control response costs, investigators also can employ different force requirements.","conclusion":"The effects of DA depletions were highly schedule-dependent. DA-depleted animals on the FR 5 schedule showed reductions in responding across the different weight conditions. In contrast, DA depletion did not significantly suppress FR 1 responding under any conditions. Addition of weights to the levers reduced responding on the FR 1 and FR 5 schedules, but did not enhance sensitivity to DA depletion. Thus, rats with accumbens DA depletions were sensitive to different ratio requirements, yet they were relatively insensitive to different force requirements within the range tested. These studies indicate that DA depletions make animals sensitive to temporal or rate components of work that greatly influence responding on ratio schedules."},{"method":"For this purpose, wild-type and IFN-gamma knockout C57BL\/6J mice were infected with adenovirus carrying the cDNA for murine IFN-gamma (i.p. 2 x 10(8) pfu of virus per mouse) and shortly thereafter tested in the behavioral battery used in the detection of AABS. Serum levels of IFN-gamma were found to peak 24 h after the infection, normalized within 5 days.","background":"Anxiety and depression of unknown etiology are frequent complications of the systemic autoimmune disease lupus erythematosus (SLE). To elucidate key pathogenic factors we study the \"autoimmunity-associated behavioral syndrome\" (AABS) in lupus-prone MRL-lpr mice. Based on the evidence that serum levels of the neuroactive cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) are increased both in human and murine forms of SLE, the present study examines whether sustained IFN-gamma production in non-autoimmune mice induces deficits comparable to AABS, particularly in tasks reflective of emotional reactivity and motivated behavior.","conclusion":"Although all infected animals showed reduced food\/water intake and body weight, the recovery rate was slower in groups injected with IFN-gamma virus. No deficits were observed in the models of anxiety, but blunted responsiveness in the sucrose preference test (a putative model of anhedonia) lasted well beyond the IFN-gamma clearance period. These results suggest that a relatively brief elevation in systemic IFN-gamma levels impairs ingestive behavior and leads to prolonged changes in motivated behavior. As such, they are consistent with the hypothesis that upregulation in synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines contributes to induction of AABS and more specifically, to limbic system dysfunction during lupus-like disease."},{"method":"Litters were subjected to ISO or were non-handled (NH). Activity levels were assessed in adult rats. Then, rats were implanted with jugular catheters and allowed to self-administer cocaine under a fixed-ratio 1 (FR1) schedule of reinforcement using an escalating dose presentation procedure. Cocaine intake, discrimination of active versus inactive levers, and ineffective active lever responses were tabulated. Effects of non-contingent cocaine infusions (primes) and increasing FR on responding were then assessed. Other rats were allowed to lever press for food under an FR1 schedule (10 s time-out).","background":"We showed previously that neonatal isolation (ISO) enhances acquisition of cocaine self-administration in adult male rats without altering acquisition of food responding. Female rats show poorer performance in learning tasks and are differentially affected by stress compared to male rats. Thus, we investigated whether ISO alters acquisition of operant responding for cocaine and food in female rats with comparison to male rats.","conclusion":"ISO enhanced acquisition of operant responding for food and cocaine in female rats. The latter was demonstrated by better lever discrimination, emission of fewer ineffective responses, and superior performance in response to primes. Yet, NH females ingested more cocaine than ISO females during the initial acquisition phase. In male rats, ISO enhanced acquisition of cocaine self-administration but not food responding. Activity levels were unaffected by ISO or gender. These data confirm and extend our previous findings demonstrating the enduring effects of ISO on adult self-administration behavior and emphasize the importance of measuring behavioral patterns versus intake in acquisition studies."},{"method":"To confirm the proposed hypothesis, picrotoxin, a GABA-A receptor antagonist, was bilaterally microinjected every 6 h for 36 h into the LC of freely moving normally behaving rats and the effects on electrophysiological signals signifying sleep-wakefulness and on brain synaptosome Na-K ATPase activity were estimated. The microinjection was done with the help of a remote control pump without handling or disturbing the rats.","background":"Isolated studies showed that norepinephrinergic REM-OFF neurons are active throughout except during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep when they are inhibited possibly by GABA. Similarly, independent studies have also reported that during REM sleep deprivation those REM-OFF neurons continue firing, that there is increased norepinephrine (NE) in the brain and that increased levels of NE increases the Na-K ATPase activity in the brain. However, it was not known if all those changes were directly related to REM sleep deprivation, what could be the mechanism for such changes and their patho-physiological significance. To confirm the same, based on the reports, mostly from our group, it was hypothesised that GABA antagonist in the locus coeruleus (LC) should at least significantly reduce REM sleep and simultaneously increase Na-K ATPase activity in the brain.","conclusion":"The findings that REM sleep was significantly reduced and there was associated increase in Na-K ATPase activity confirmed our hypothesis. The results also support our modified (GABA-mediated) model of neural connections in the LC for the regulation of REM sleep. Also, this is probably the first report to simulate REM sleep deprivation using receptor antagonist."},{"method":"The use of stimuli placed far to the right or left proved to engage preferentially the eye system directly fed by right or left eye system (RES, LES).","background":"Zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) larvae (8 days) were tested singly in a swimway made up of six compartments. The larva emerged into each compartment in turn, and its response to visual features (e.g. turning away) was affected by memory of previous layouts, as well as by home tank experience.","conclusion":"At least three behavioural mechanisms appeared to show similar laterality in larva and adult. Both turned right in startle-induced locomotion. In both, LES was preferentially involved in assessment of novelty. Thus, in larvae, use of LES caused more investigation of a familiar stimulus in a strange context. Finally, in larvae there was some evidence that (as is the case in adults) RES was responsible for the visual control of response. Here the evidence for the adult was the preferential use of the right eye to view the object of response, whereas for the larva, it was the enhanced ability to sustain a motor strategy when RES was in use."},{"method":"Sixteen young healthy volunteers were studied in a 40-h \"constant posture protocol\" under high sleep pressure (i.e. sleep deprivation) and low sleep pressure conditions (i.e. sleep satiation attained by multiple naps).","background":"Humans are able to learn complex sequences even without conscious awareness. We have studied the repercussions of circadian phase and sleep pressure on the ability to learn structured sequences using a serial reaction time task (SRT).","conclusion":"Here we show that learning of different sequence structures improved after multiple naps, in particular after naps that followed the circadian peak of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. This situation following sleep contrasted with the lack of learning without sleep. We have evidenced that the observed amelioration of learning new sequences came about by memorizing short sub-fragments (\"chunks\") of the sequence train. However, SRT performance did not deteriorate under high sleep pressure, despite the high level of sleepiness. Our data indicate that sequence learning is modulated by circadian phase, and the neurophysiological medium required for this type of learning is related to sleep."},{"method":"In the present study, rotenone (3 microg) was administered bilaterally stereotaxically into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) to produce parkinsonian symptoms. Behavioural and biochemical data showed a strong increase in catalepsy, a decrease in locomotor activity and a significant depletion of dopamine levels in the striatum as compared to sham-lesioned animals. If the locomotor deficits are caused by the depletion of dopaminergic neurons, then L-DOPA should counteract motor deficits because L-DOPA therapy reverses mostly all motor deficits in human Parkinsonian patients. To examine the effectiveness of L-DOPA in reversing the motor deficit in rats, two different doses of L-DOPA (5 and 10 mg\/kg) in combination with the peripheral amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor benserazide were daily administrated intraperitonially for a period of 31 days lesioned animals.","background":"Rotenone (an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I) has been proposed as a model of Parkinson's disease (PD) as it induces nigrostriatal degeneration associated with alpha-synuclein inclusions. So far, only peripherally administered rotenone has been used as a model of PD. There has not been any investigation on the neurobehavioral changes induced by bilateral lesions of dopaminergic neurons by rotenone in rats.","conclusion":"L-DOPA plus benserazide counteracted catalepsy dose-dependently and increased locomotor activity. The results indicate that rotenone infused into the MFB destroys dopaminergic neurons, induces pakinsonian symptoms that are reversed by the clinically effective anti-parkinsonian drug L-DOPA. Therefore, sterotaxically infused rotenone may be useful for screening drugs for the treatment of PD."},{"method":"Here, the behavioral effects of dopaminergic agents L-DOPA (15 mg\/kg) and D-amphetamine (4 mg\/kg) in two different pathophysiological conditions have been explored; One group involving only dopaminergic deficiency with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and the other group with both dopaminergic and noradrenergic deficiency with N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4). DSP-4 specifically depleted noradrenaline from locus coeruleus terminal fields. 6-OHDA lesion depleted dopamine and its metabolites DOPAC, HVA and 3-MT in the regions of basal ganglia and it was potentiated by additional locus coeruleus denervation.","background":"In Parkinson's disease, besides the dopaminergic neurodegeneration, locus coeruleus noradrenergic neurons degenerate as well. Noradrenergic neurons have potential anti-parkinsonian, neuromodulatory and neuroprotective properties. Presently, an animal model with dopaminergic lesion has been used as a standard model of Parkinson's disease. The behavioral effects of dopaminergic agents in a Parkinson's animal model with additional noradrenergic lesions has not been studied so far.","conclusion":"Dopaminergic lesion produced catalepsy and hypoactivity. Hypoactivity in openfield was potentiated by additional noradrenergic denervation of locus coeruleus neurons. L-DOPA produced effective anticataleptic activity in group with both dopaminergic and noradrenergic lesions and D-amphetamine was found to be more effective in group only with dopaminergic lesions, indicating increased dopaminergic neurodegeneration after noradrenergic lesions. L-DOPA produced hyperactivity in dual neurodegenerated group indicating its differential activity in an animal model with noradrenergic and dopaminergic lesions. These findings indicate the neuroprotective and symptomatic role of noradrenergic neurons. It implicates the importance of noradrenergic pathophysiology in Parkinson's disease and its treatment and need for a more relevant animal model."},{"method":"In this study, we examined the effects of hypothermia and hyperthermia on learning and memory deficits following neonatal HI insult. Seven-day-old Wistar rats were subjected to left carotid artery ligation followed by 2 h of hypoxia (8% O2\/92% N2) under three different temperature conditions: 27 degrees C (hypothermia), 33 degrees C (normothermia) and 37 degrees C (hyperthermia) in temperature-controlled chambers.","background":"We previously reported that rats exposed to neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) insult showed selective and long-lasting learning and memory impairments in the plus maze, 8-arm radial maze, choice reaction time (CRT) task, and water maze, and that they showed severe brain injury to areas such as parietal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and thalamus.","conclusion":"Hypothermia significantly reduced attentional deficits in the CRT task and spatial learning deficits in the water maze, and protected against severe brain injury in comparison with the control temperature. On the other hand, hyperthermia aggravated the behavioral deficits and brain injury. These outcomes clearly show that temperature regulation during HI insult plays an important role in the induction of behavioral and histological changes following neonatal HI insult in rats."},{"method":"Using food reward, two cognitive tasks were examined after lidocaine inactivation of the dorsal (dSUB) or ventral (vSUB) subiculum, the primary hippocampal output regions in rats.

Inactivation of the dSUB and vSUB with 10microg lidocaine impaired hippocampal-dependent win-shift performance. Amygdalar-dependant conditioned cue preference, used as a test for behavioral specificity of lidocaine, was not affected following inactivation of either site. Inactivation of the dSUB with 100 microg lidocaine significantly reduced drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior studied during the cocaine self-administration maintenance phase. Following extinction, inactivation of neither the dSUB nor vSUB influenced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior induced by drug-paired cues presented alone or with a cocaine priming injection.","background":"There is considerable interest in elucidating neurocognitive mechanisms of cocaine addiction. This report focuses on the hippocampal memory system.","conclusion":"The impairments in win-shift performance are consistent with the spatial processing functions of the dSUB and vSUB, and the reduction in drug-taking behavior is consistent with the non-spatial temporal processing functions of the dSUB. The lack of an effect of dSUB and vSUB inactivation on reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior may relate to the fact that the contextual associations with cocaine were well-practiced at the time of cue reinstatement testing, and therefore, drug-seeking behavior was likely regulated by nonhippocampal-dependent mechanisms."},{"method":"We confirmed that rats administered with LiCl showed a reduction in analgesia when administered morphine 24 h later.

The increase in REMS after the blockade of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the LDT by WAY 100635 further supports our proposal. The effects of systemic flesinoxan on sleep variables may depend mainly on the activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, whereas the effects corresponding to systemic WAY 100635 may be predominantly related to the blockade of presynaptic somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors."},{"method":"Intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 mg\/kg scopolamine had no effect, but 2 mg\/kg severely compromised visual acuity, but did not affect the swim strategy to solve the task.

For humans, a similar relationship has been assumed. However, results from independent studies were obtained from different tasks and indicated different side preferences.","conclusion":"We observed a left-sided preference for long-term spontaneous turning behavior and no significant side preference for veering and stepping behavior. The absence of consistent side preferences suggests that DA does not equally control lateralized whole-body movements.

Lett. 339 (2003) 115] that levodopa supplementation decreases right-sided veering tendencies, while stepping behavior was unaffected by substance intake. We suggest that veering tendencies, which appeared equally pronounced in either direction, are under dopaminergic control as long as attention is directed towards extrapersonal space. Side preferences in lateralized whole-body movement tasks are thus neither comparable between tasks nor within subjects. We conclude that experimental parameters such as visuo-spatial control and spatial task demands (veering is directed to extrapersonal space and stepping to peripersonal space) determine whether or not the DA system is involved."},{"method":"Rats were given unilateral injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the substantia nigra.

Among others, it has neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects. In the present study, we investigated the effects of PACAP in a rat model of Parkinson's disease.","conclusion":"Control animals without PACAP treatment displayed severe hypokinesia at 1 and 10 days postlesion when compared to animals receiving saline only. In only 1 day postlesion, by contrast, PACAP-treated rats showed no hypokinesia. Asymmetrical signs, such as turning, rearing and biased thigmotaxic scanning were observed in all lesioned animals 1 day postlesion. PACAP-treated animals, however, showed better recovery as they ceased to display asymmetrical signs 10 days later and showed markedly less apomorphine-induced rotations. Tyrosine-hydroxylase immunohistochemistry revealed that control animals had more than 95% loss of the dopaminergic cells in the ipsilateral substantia nigra, while PACAP-treated animals had only approximately 50% loss of dopaminergic cells. In summary, the present results show the neuroprotective effect of PACAP in 6-OHDA-induced lesion of substantia nigra, with less severe acute neurological symptoms and a more rapid amelioration of behavioral deficits."},{"method":"The experiments were made in the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), using a telemetric extracellular recording technique which allowed to register neuronal activity in freely moving animals during natural vocal communication.","background":"In order to find out whether the inferior colliculus, in addition to its auditory decoding function, also has an auditory gating function in the sense that it treats self-produced sounds differently from external ones, we have explored the inferior colliculus and bordering tegmentum for neurones reacting differently to self-produced vocalizations and vocalizations produced by conspecifics.","conclusion":"The results show that the neurones of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus do not react differently to self-produced and group mate vocalizations of the same type. In the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus, in addition to classical auditory neurones, neurones are found which react to the vocalizations of group mates, but not to self-produced vocalizations. In the paralemniscal area just below the inferior colliculus, there are neurones which are active during self-produced vocalization, but not during vocalization produced by other animals. The results suggest that the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus and bordering tegmentum are involved in vocalization-dependent auditory gating processes."},{"method":"The purpose of the present experiment was to implement such a procedure in several successive phases, including pre-food basal rates of interaction with sensors in a chamber, food-hopper training, and a simple disk-baiting procedure that produced differentially food-reinforced disk pressing (FR1) and provided quantitative measures of learning in outbred (CD-1) and inbred (C57BL\/6J, BALB\/cJ) mice. Response acquisition performances were measured in terms of the number of correct food-producing responses (disk press to hopper entry in less than 5s).","background":"Developments in the genetic manipulation of mice have intensified interest in the relation between genes, environment and learned behavior, which in turn has led to exploration of experimental procedures for assessing genetic influences on learning using methods such as response acquisition. The requirement for multiple experimental control groups in such genetic comparisons studies amplifies the need for reliable, instrument-directed, learning assessment paradigms.","conclusion":"The three mouse types showed differences in several performance measures prior to response acquisition training. Pre-food basal performances did not predict subsequent rate of acquisition of the target response. On average, CD-1 mice met a criterion of 50 food-producing responses slightly, but not significantly, faster than BALB\/cJ mice. The C57BL\/6J mice took significantly longer to meet the learning criterion and had slower response rates, due to longer after-reinforcement pausing. Procedural differences (massed versus partial\/distributed training) and reinforcement parameters (duration of access) may differentially affect different mouse types independently of genetic differences in response acquisition."},{"method":"When compared to their sham-operated counterparts, lesioned rats showed nocturnal hyperactivity, no reference memory deficit, but working memory was impaired in the water maze and during the initial stage of radial-maze testing. Their locomotor responsiveness to D-amphetamine was exaggerated. Histological verifications confirmed lesions in the ventral subiculum. Material stained for acetylcholinesterase activity indicated septohippocampal and commissural\/associational sprouting, accounting for partial damage to the perforant paths.","background":"Adult Long-Evans male rats were subjected to electrolytic lesions of the ventral subiculum, and tested for locomotor activity in the home cage, reference and working memory in the water maze, working memory in the radial maze, and D-amphetamine-induced locomotion (1mg\/kg, i.p.).","conclusion":"These results showed that ventral subiculum lesions (i) do not alter the capability of rats to learn repeatedly presented spatial information, and (ii) impair, but do not prevent, spatial working memory, suggesting that the ventral subiculum is preferentially involved in short-term memory for spatial locations. Given the electrolytic nature of the lesion, the lesion-induced potentiation of the locomotor response to amphetamine is probably easier explained by partial disruption of the perforant paths than by damage to neurons of the ventral subiculum."},{"method":"Here we will present data on orbitofrontal cortex function from a number of parallel studies from our laboratories that employed single unit recording techniques to probe neural encoding in rat orbitofrontal cortex and related parts of the amygdala and the hippocampal memory systems.","background":"The recognition that certain aspects of prefrontal function can be effectively modeled in rats has led to a slow expansion of interest in rat prefrontal cortex over the past decade. One of the most promising of these model systems is the orbitofrontal cortex of the rat. Rat orbitofrontal cortex is anatomically similar to the orbital prefrontal region in primates, and this similarity is borne out by behavioral and neurophysiological findings.","conclusion":"Together, these reports and associated behavioral studies suggest that the orbitofrontal region, in both rats and primates, is specialized to integrate concrete and abstract sensory constructs with information regarding the incentive value of associated outcomes to guide or modulate behavior. To the extent that monkey prefrontal function can model certain aspects of human prefrontal function, we argue that this model can now be extended to the rat orbitofrontal cortex. In addition, we argue that the function of orbitofrontal cortex needs to be considered in terms of its interactions with other brain systems."},{"method":"These issues were addressed by exposing rats to either one or four sessions of a cued classical conditioning task, and subsequently examining c-fos immunoreactivity in various areas of the PFC.","background":"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to be involved in associative learning; however, its specific role in acquisition of cued classical conditioning has not yet been determined. Furthermore, the role of regional differences within the PFC in the acquisition of cued conditioning is not well described.","conclusion":"Differences in patterns of c-fos immunopositive nuclei were found when comparing the PFC areas examined. No significant differences were found between rats presented with a temporally contingent conditioned stimulus (CS) light and food (paired groups) and those presented with the same stimuli temporally non-contingently (unpaired groups). In lateral and orbital PFC, both the paired and unpaired groups showed more c-fos immunopositive nuclei than control groups exposed only to the behavioral setup (context exposed groups), and all groups showed a drop in c-fos immunopositive nuclei from session 1 to session 4. In dorsal medial PFC, no differences were seen between the paired, unpaired and context exposed groups. These groups did, however, differ from naive animals, an effect that was not seen in the ventral medial PFC. The results of this study do not support a role for the PFC in the acquisition of a cued classical conditioning task. The differences seen between paired, unpaired and context exposed groups in orbital and lateral PFC could be due to contextual conditioning or reward-related effects."},{"method":"To investigate this, tetrode recordings were made in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) of rats performing a Go-NoGo task.","background":"A crucial aspect of organizing goal-directed behavior is the ability to form neural representations of relationships between environmental stimuli, actions and reinforcement. Very little is known yet about the neural encoding of response-reward relationships, a process which is deemed essential for purposeful behavior.","conclusion":"After task acquisition, a subset of neurons showed a sustained change in firing during the rewarded action sequence that was triggered by a specific visual cue. When these changes were monitored in the course of learning, they were seen to develop in parallel with the behavioral learning curve and were highly sensitive to a switch in reward contingencies. These sustained changes correlated with the reward-associated action sequence, not with sensory or reward-predicting properties of the cue or individual motor acts per se. This novel type of neural plasticity may contribute to the formation of response-reinforcer associations and of behavioral strategies for guiding goal-directed action."},{"method":"Here, the objectives were to investigate: (i). whether a resistance to extinction without any prefrontal acute synaptic plasticity could produce LTD-like changes, and (ii). by the use of paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) analyses, whether pre- or post-synaptic mechanisms were involved in this LTD phenomenon. Preliminary analyses indicated that levels of acute depression did not correlate with the degree of fear acquisition (effects of number of CS-US pairings). As a consequence, mice conditioned with 2CS+ or 2CS+\/2CS- (partial reinforcement of the CS known to induce resistance to extinction) exhibited CS-associated freezing without any acute synaptic depression in the mPFC. However, during further CS-alone presentations, the 2CS+\/2CS- group developed LTD-like changes that accompanied their resistance to extinguish freezing to the CS.","background":"Accumulative evidence indicates that acute (before extinction) and long-lasting (during extinction) depression can occur at excitatory synapses in mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during re-exposure to a tone (conditioned stimulus: CS), previously paired with footshock (unconditioned stimulus: US). As recently shown, the long-term depression (LTD)-like plasticity in the mPFC does not interfere with extinction of CS-evoked freezing but predicts spontaneous recovery of this fear response.","conclusion":"In contrast, the 2CS+ group normally extinguished their conditioned freezing with synaptic transmission remaining at baseline levels. PPF analyses revealed that facilitation was unchanged following prefrontal LTD. These data, combined with our previous findings, (i). support a critical involvement of prefrontal LTD-like changes in spontaneous recovery of fear responses, and (ii). suggest a post-synaptic site for these changes."},{"method":"In the present series of studies, we investigated the behavioural effects of bilateral excitotoxic lesions of different regions of the rat neocortex in the 5-choice serial reaction time task. Whereas lesions of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) impaired performance of the task as revealed by a reduction in discriminative accuracy, lesions made to distinct ventral regions of the frontal cortex showed selective deficits in inhibitory measures of control. Specifically, the infralimbic lesion produced increases in premature responding that was accompanied by fast response latencies. By comparison, the orbitofrontal lesion showed perseverative tendencies particularly when the inter-trial interval was made long and unpredictable, a challenge that would normally promote premature responding instead.","background":"It is becoming increasingly apparent that multiple functions of the frontal cortex such as inhibitory control and executive attention are likely sustained by its functionally distinct and interacting sub-regions but the precise localization of dissociable executive processes has proved difficult and controversial.","conclusion":"These different behavioural effects following dorsal and ventral lesions of the rodent frontal cortex signifies the integrity of the frontal cortex in multiple executive mechanisms that work independently and complementarily by which performance is optimized. Furthermore, these data provide new insights into the functional organization of the rodent frontal cortex with a particular emphasis on localization of function."},{"method":"The present study examined the effects of mPFCv lesions made after training. Such lesions resulted in reduced freezing to contextual stimuli and normal responding to the CS presented alone during a retention test. Rats were then subjected to extinction trials (CS without US) over multiple days. In contrast to pre-training lesions, post-training lesions had little effect on extinction rate. All rats were given additional training.","background":"Several years ago, we found that lesions of ventral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFCv) disrupted performance during the extinction component of a classical fear conditioning task without affecting acquisition performance. We called this emotional perseveration, hypothesizing that mPFCv may normally act to inhibit fear responses to a conditioned stimulus (CS) when the CS no longer signals danger. Subsequent studies have supported this hypothesis, showing that mPFCv is crucial for the memory of prior extinction training.","conclusion":"Lesioned rats expressed greater fear reactions than controls, indicating that prior extinction was less effective in them. Lesioned rats also showed resistance to extinction during reextinction trials, confirming our earlier finding that lesions made before training weaken the effectiveness of extinction trials. These results suggest three conclusions. First, an intact mPFCv during acquisition may protect the animal from prolonged responding during extinction trials following brain insult. Second, changes in mPFCv may predispose subjects toward enhanced fear reactions that are difficult to extinguish when reexposed to fearful stimuli, due to a diminished capacity to benefit from the fear-reducing impact of prior extinction experience. Third, contextual cues processed by mPFCv may influence extinction performance."},{"method":"We report inhibition functions on the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) task for normal rats, and following damage to the medial prefrontal cortex or to the nucleus accumbens core. Neither group of excitotoxic lesions produced significant deficits on task performance. Subsequent treatment with D-amphetamine (0.3 and 1.0mg\/kg) resulted in quicker go-trial reaction times (mRT) overall, but had no significant effect on SSRT.","background":"The 'stop-signal' task measures the ability to inhibit a response that has already been initiated, i.e. the ability to stop. Human subjects who have been classified as 'impulsive', for example, those with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are slower to react to the stop signal, and are often less sensitive to changes in the timing of signals to stop. Imaging studies have implicated fronto-striatal circuitry in the mediation of this form of response control.","conclusion":"Neither medial prefrontal cortex nor nucleus accumbens lesions had any differential effects on performance following D-amphetamine. These results are discussed with respect to the fronto-striatal circuitry involved in the mediation of behavioural inhibition."},{"method":"Rats with AC-PC lesions acquired the task as readily as controls. In contrast, the PL-IL lesioned rats did not learn the task.","background":"In order to test an attribute specificity model of prefrontal cortex function, rats with lesions in the prelimbic-infralimbic (PL-IL) or anterior cingulate and precentral (AC-PC) subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex and controls were trained on an object-place paired associate task.","conclusion":"Whenever higher order processing is required to solve a task, the data support an attribute-specificity model of prefrontal cortex function in that the PL-IL cortices support both object and place attribute information in a variety of tasks including object-place paired associate learning."},{"method":"In the present paper we will compare the structural and functional characteristics of the prefrontal cortex of nonhuman primates and rats.","background":"The lack of a single anatomical or functional definition of 'prefrontal cortex' has led to different and, in some respects, controversial views on the existence of a prefrontal cortex in non-primate mammals, in particular in rats. Until the classic paper by Rose and Woolsey [Res. Publ. Assoc. Nerv. Ment. Dis. 27 (1948) 210], the general idea was that a prefrontal cortex is unique to primate species. Rose and Woolsey's 'prefrontal cortex' definition was based upon a single anatomical criterion, i.e. the cortical projection area of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. Single criteria, however, do not appear to be sufficient for defining the prefrontal cortex. Therefore, other anatomical and functional characteristics are currently used to identify the prefrontal cortex in different species. Yet, recently the debate about the nature of the prefrontal cortex in non-primate species has been resumed.","conclusion":"We will argue that rats have a functionally divided prefrontal cortex that includes not only features of the medial and orbital areas in primates, but also some features of the primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex."},{"method":"With this in mind, we tested eight strains of mice (129S1\/SvImJ, 129S2\/SvPasIcoCrlBR, 129S6\/SvEvTac, B6129SF1\/J, C57BL\/6J, C57BL\/6N, LP\/J and SM\/J), including the sources of five ES cell lines commonly used for gene targeting, in the spatial (submerged platform) version of the Morris water maze, the most widely used paradigm to evaluate the cognitive abilities of genetically modified mice.","background":"The availability of pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells for gene targeting has resulted in laboratory mice becoming important animal models of human neurological disease. Inbred strains of mice differ in many behavioural phenotypes, such that the same gene mutation can appear to have different phenotypic effects when introduced onto different genetic backgrounds. Prior knowledge of the behavioural phenotypes of the inbred strains used for gene targeting would, therefore, allow the selection of the most appropriate genetic background for the hypothesis to be tested.","conclusion":"The three 129 substrain sources of ES cell lines demonstrated spatial learning in the water maze that was superior to that of C57BL\/6J, the inbred strain most commonly used for the maintenance and phenotypic testing of mutations. In addition, 129S6\/SvEvTac was unique amongst the eight strains tested in having a particular capacity for reversal learning, when the submerged platform was relocated to the opposite quadrant. We conclude that some substrains of 129 could provide suitable genetic backgrounds for testing gene mutations that might be expected to impair cognitive function, thus negating the need to backcross to C57BL\/6J, thereby avoiding the so-called \"flanking gene problem\"."},{"method":"Both ketanserin and SB 206553 inhibited lordosis behavior after infusion into the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN), but ketanserin was slightly more effective than the 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist.

It has also been shown that the depression of mSuM activity by chlordiazepoxide causes modest impairment of spatial learning. On the other hand, the lateral supramammillary nucleus (lSum) increases long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal population spikes. However, to our knowledge, no reports exist concerning the role of the supramammillary area (SuM) in passive avoidance (PA) learning.","conclusion":"When lidocaine was injected 5 min before training there was no effect on acquisition of PA but retrieval was significantly poorer than the control group injected with saline. Lidocaine injection 5 min after the acquisition trial impaired PA retention, but reversible inactivation of SuM at 90 and 360 min after training and 5 min before the retrieval test showed no significant effect on PA retention. It can be concluded that SuM contributes to PA consolidation at least 5 min after the acquisition trial and that this effect may be accomplished through SuM projections to the septal and\/or hippocampal areas participating in the PA memorization processes."},{"method":"In the present study, we sought to characterize body weight, body fat and food intake regulation in a mouse with a targeted disruption of the dopamine-3 receptor gene (Drd3). In the first set of experiments male and female wild-type and mutant (Drd3-\/-) mice were given access to two different diets varying in fat content. Body weight, food intake, carcass analysis and plasma levels of leptin and insulin were measured.","background":"Dopamine (DA) signaling has been implicated in the control of energy balance and ingestive behavior.","conclusion":"Male Drd3-\/- mice have increased body weight and body fat when given access to high fat (HF) diet but not standard rodent chow. The female Drd3-\/- mice did not demonstrate increased body weight when given access to either diet, but did have increased body fat on both diets. Plasma leptin and insulin levels reflected the increased adiposity demonstrated in each genotype and gender. These findings suggest the D3-R signaling is involved in the regulation of body weight and body fat when mice are given access to diets differing in palatability and fat content."},{"method":"Reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior was triggered by contingent presentation of a cocaine-conditioned cue or an amphetamine priming injection.","background":"Among cocaine addicts, there is a strong variation in response to relapse provoking factors like conditioned cues and renewed contact with the drug. Here we show that such large individual differences also exist in rats.","conclusion":"We found no positive correlation between cue- and drug-controlled reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Rather, a slight, but significant negative correlation was observed, which was particularly evident in two subgroups of rats that responded highest following either amphetamine priming or cue presentation. A large middle group responded equally for both relapse provoking factors. Further, cocaine-seeking behavior during the first extinction session correlated positively with cue-induced reinstatement. In conclusion, the present findings indicate that the therapeutic efficacy of relapse prevention strategies may depend on individual sensitivity to distinct relapse provoking stimuli."},{"method":"To assess these differences at the neuronal level, we evaluated core and shell single-unit activity in eight rats during one-trial, free-choice entry into a novel compartment. Changes in firing rate during approach of (orientation toward) and entry into (nose cross) novelty were assessed relative to a pre-novelty baseline when the animals were behaviorally active.","background":"Core and shell regions of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) have been implicated in different aspects of goal-directed behavior.","conclusion":"Increases and decreases in neuronal activity were recorded in both regions during both phases of the novelty response. The regional distribution of these responses, however, was significantly different during the approach phase with roughly equal proportions of neuronal excitations (8\/29) and inhibitions (6\/29) in core but a shift away from excitation (2\/40) toward inhibition (12\/40) in shell. No regional differences emerged during subsequent approach of the familiar compartment from the novel chamber or during entry to either the novel or familiar compartment. Taken together, our results during approach to free-choice novelty indicate a regional dissociation in NAcc firing rate may play a role in appetitive behavior."},{"method":"The present experiments assessed the effects of stimulating the vHip or dHip on PPI and NAc DA efflux. As predicted, 20 Hz stimulation (10 s, 300 microA) of the vHip, but not the dHip, reversibly disrupted PPI. In contrast, 2 Hz stimulation (100 s, 300 microA) of the vHip failed to affect PPI. Microdialysis experiments revealed that 20 Hz stimulation of the vHip increased NAc DA efflux only in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulating electrode, whereas 20 Hz stimulation of the dHip failed to affect NAc DA efflux.","background":"Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a normal reduction in the startle response produced when a brief, low intensity stimulus is presented prior to a startle-evoking stimulus. PPI is often disrupted in humans diagnosed with schizophrenia. As similar stimuli elicit PPI in rodents and humans, interventions in rodents that disrupt PPI may reveal aspects of neuronal dysfunction relevant to schizophrenia. Stimulation of the ventral hippocampus (vHip) with NMDA significantly increases dopamine (DA) efflux in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and disrupts PPI, whereas NMDA infusion into the dorsal hippocampus (dHip) fails to alter PPI. Our previous research shows that brief periods of 20 Hz electrical vHip stimulation also significantly increase NAc DA efflux.","conclusion":"These data demonstrate the regional specificity and frequency-dependent effects of hippocampal activity on PPI.

Injection in the 4th ventricle was also effective perhaps by acting on several of these regions simultaneously. A partial inhibition was obtained from the motor cortex.

The rats were trained to discriminate one of two doses of amphetamine (0.25 and 0.5mg\/kg) from saline. Saline and amphetamine were administered intraperitoneally immediately before each daily session according to a semi-random schedule for a total of 50 sessions.

At this stage, the Deltarelease latency was high at the beginning and then decreased. The rise in the Deltarelease latency within the learning acquisition period increased depending on the amount of experience with problems they had solved, whereas the Deltamovement time within that period was not significantly affected by the experience with problems. The present findings suggest that the number of problem-solving experiences could promote profound cognitive processing, which may be related to a conceptual representation that actualizes the flexibility of learning, namely, the learning set."},{"method":"Herein, we investigated the effects of valproate on the induction and the expression of behavioral sensitization to morphine.

Several lines of evidence have shown that the central GABAergic system is involved in behavioral sensitization induced by morphine. Valproate, a clinically widely used anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer, can mainly inhibit gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase and activate glutamic acid decarboxylase, which result in decrease in the degradation and increase in the synthesis of GABA, and then the elevation of extracellular GABA in the central nervous system.

This phenomenon, referred to as sensitization, is believed to be related to the motor response complications (dyskinesias, on-off states) that occur during chronic administration of levodopa in Parkinson's disease patients. In recent years a new method for the evaluation of abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) secondary to dopaminergic stimulation in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats was described. These AIMs resemble dyskinesias as seen in parkinsonian patients under levodopa therapy.","conclusion":"Our results show that in apomorphine-treated rats, rotational behavior and AIMs run a parallel course of enhancement, while in those receiving quinpirole there is a dissociation, suggesting that they could be mediated by different mechanisms. The finding of a significant priming effect on subsequent testing of 6-OHDA lesioned rats should be borne in mind as the use of these pharmacological tests in the screening of well lesioned animals could lead to an erroneous interpretation of further results on dyskinesias and rotational behavior."},{"method":"In the present study, we investigated the effects of mAb IN-1 treatment after adult sensorimotor cortex (SMC) aspiration lesion on behavioral recovery and neuroanatomical plasticity in the corticospinal tract. Adult rats underwent unilateral SMC aspiration lesion and treatment with either mAb IN-1 or a control Ab, or no treatment. Animals were then tested over a 6-week period in the skilled forelimb use task and the skilled ladder rung walking task.","background":"We have previously reported that monoclonal antibody (mAb) IN-1 treatment after ischemic infarct in adult rats results in significant recovery of skilled forelimb use. Such recovery was correlated with axonal outgrowth from the intact, opposite motor cortex into deafferented subcortical motor areas.","conclusion":"We found that animals treated with mAb IN-1 after SMC lesion fully recovered the use of forelimb reaching, but showed no improvement in digit grasping as tested in the skilled forelimb use task. The mAb IN-1 treatment group was also significantly improved as compared to control groups in the skilled ladder rung walking test. Furthermore, neuroanatomical tracing revealed a significant increase in the corticospinal projections into the deafferented motor areas of the spinal cord after mAb IN-1 treatment. These results indicate that treatment with mAb IN-1 after cortical aspiration lesion induces remodeling of motor pathways resulting in recovery in only certain behavioral tasks, suggesting that the cause of brain damage influences behavioral recovery after mAb IN-1 treatment."},{"method":"In the present study, we assessed the ability of old and young NCAM null mice to learn an odour discrimination task.

Although dramatically down regulated after birth in most regions of the nervous system, PSA-NCAM remains highly expressed into adulthood in areas that have ongoing regeneration and plasticity such as in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus. Consequently, lack of PSA-NCAM in NCAM null mice results in distinct morphological changes to these areas. The functional correlates of these changes are not well defined although there have been reports that learning is impaired in NCAM null mice.","conclusion":"In a subsequent preference test, conducted in the absence of sugar, all animals, regardless of strain or age, spent significantly more time digging in the CS+ odour than in the CS- odour.

The expression of c-fos mRNA was observed in the frontal cortex and thalamus of mice showing signs of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal, while the expression of c-fos mRNA was significantly diminished by co-administration of DHEAS with morphine. On the naloxone-precipitated withdrawal, mice showed a significant elevation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels in the thalamus, whereas chronic administration of DHEAS with morphine did not affect the increase in cAMP.

In males, but not females, SI produced an anxiogenic profile in the elevated plus maze. Male isolates showed a trend towards increased startle reflex amplitude relative to socially-reared controls. Moreover, SI in males produced alterations of the HPA axis functioning as reflected by higher basal levels of ACTH, and enhanced release of ACTH and corticosterone following stress. In contrast, startle response or HPA axis functioning were not altered in female isolates. Social isolates from both genders showed reduced contextual fear-conditioning. Finally, the mRNA expression of MR and GR was not modified by SI.","background":"The present study investigated the effects of post-weaning social isolation (SI) on behavioural and neuroendocrine reactivity to stress of male and female rats. Innate aspects of fear and anxiety were assessed in the open field and elevated plus maze tests. Spontaneous startle reflex and conditioned fear response were further investigated. The neuroendocrine response of isolates was examined by measuring basal and stress release of ACTH and corticosterone and by evaluating the mRNA expression of mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors using in situ hybridization.","conclusion":"The results of the present study suggest that chronic SI increases emotional reactivity to stress and produces a hyperfunction of the HPA axis in adult rats, particularly in males."},{"method":"Here we tested this hypothesis at the behavioral level by examining whether social and inanimate stimulation affect spatial memory formation and non-spatial discrimination reversal learning selectively. Spatial memory formation is known to depend on hippocampal-neocortical pathways, whereas reversal learning depends primarily on prefrontal cortico-striatal pathways. Male Lister hooded rats were housed singly or in groups of three in either small barren or large enriched cages, from weaning onwards. After 10 weeks of differential housing, spatial learning and memory were examined in the Morris water maze, followed by a series of tactile and odour discriminations, including discrimination reversal, in a two-choice discrimination task.","background":"Environmental enrichment induces structural and biochemical changes in the brains of mammals that correlate with improved learning and memory. Research in rats suggests that social compared to inanimate stimulation might affect behavior differently, by acting upon dissociable neural substrates.","conclusion":"Regardless of inanimate stimulation, social deprivation affected neither the acquisition of simple or complex discriminations, nor spatial memory formation, but was associated with impaired reversal learning in the two-choice discrimination task. By contrast, inanimate deprivation, regardless of social stimulation, affected neither acquisition nor reversal of two-choice discriminations, but selectively delayed the acquisition of spatial memory in the Morris water maze. This is the first demonstration of a double dissociation of early social and inanimate stimulation on two distinct behavioural functions that are mediated by dissociable underlying neural pathways. These findings strengthen the view that social and inanimate stimulation act, at least in part, upon dissociable neural substrates."},{"method":"Thus, we investigated if environmental enrichment can protect rats against the cognitive and neurological consequences of transient ischemia. We evaluated the impairment of learning and memory with three tasks: odour discrimination, object exploration and spatial learning.","background":"Environmental enrichment promotes structural and functional changes in the brain, including enhanced learning and memory performance in rodents. Transient global cerebral ischemia (15 min) causes specific damage to dorsal hippocampal area CA1 pyramidal cells of the rat concomitantly with cognitive deficits.","conclusion":"Contrary to expectation, we found that the enriched environment improved performances for both ischemic and sham rats in odour discrimination and object exploration tasks compared with standard condition housed rats. After exposure to an enriched environment, ischemic rats performed better in the water maze than those in the standard housing conditions. However, exposure to an enriched environment does not protect against actual loss of CA1 pyramidal cells. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were increased in environmental enrichment animals compared to those housed in standard conditions. We conclude that environmental enrichment has positive effects that are independent of the effects of ischemic brain lesions."},{"method":"Sleep parameters were compared in rats fed ad libitum, food restricted during 4 days, or reefed isocalorically after food restriction with three dietary regimens varying in terms of the amount (14% versus 30%) or quality (milk protein or alpha-lactalbumin) of protein.","background":"Sleep depends on the quantity and quality of the diet. Several studies have shown that food deprivation results in a reduction in sleep duration. It has also been demonstrated that in the newborn, the supply of certain essential amino acids improves sleep through their action on the synthesis of specific neurotransmitters.

Intrastriatal injection of the excitotoxin quinolinic acid (QA), an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist, appears to reproduce in rats some of the clinical features of human HD, included motor and behavioural deficits. Aim of this study was to assess whether the behavioural alterations described in the QA rat model of HD progressed over time.","conclusion":"Lesioned rats showed progressive alterations in performance in this task. Whereas sham and QA rats did not markedly differ 2 weeks post-lesion, lesioned rats were significantly more active than controls 2 and 6 months after surgery. Specifically, frequency and duration of rearing and wall rearing increased progressively over time, while grooming was enhanced at 2 months post-lesion only. Spatial and object novelty discrimination was not affected. These results show that a single injection of QA excitotoxin can induce behavioural changes that progress over time. The main implication of these findings is that, besides genetic mice models of HD, QA-lesioned rats may represent a suitable mean to test the ability of new drugs to slow down disease progression."},{"method":"Prepulse inhibition (PPI), i.e. reduction of ASR by prepulses, was maximal when the interval between prepulses and startle stimuli was in the range of 37.5-100 ms. Prepulse facilitation (PPF), i.e. increase of ASR by prepulses, was maximal when the prepulse preceded the startle stimulus by 12.5 ms. PPI increased with increasing prepulse SPL, PPF first increased then decreased when prepulse SPL was increased. Percent PPI was independent from startle stimulus SPL. All strains showed a long-term increase of PPI when tested for several days; one strain (129) also showed an increase of PPF over days.","background":"The influence of prepulses on the acoustic startle response (ASR) was measured in three inbred mouse strains, C57BL\/6J, 129\/SvHsd, and AKR\/OlaHsd, and one hybrid strain produced by crossing wild mice and NMRI mice.","conclusion":"The present results clearly show that PPI and PPF are independent processes, which add to yield the final response change. PPF and the observed long-term changes of PPI and PPF are stronger expressed in mice than have been observed in rats under similar conditions. Since there were significant differences between the strains of mice with respect to PPI and PPF, genetically different strains of mice are a promising tool to study these two processes."},{"method":"After learning the task from the first starting point, they were trained to perform the navigation task from a second starting point which is already familiar to them during the first training session.","background":"To determine whether monkeys can navigate a virtual environment, and whether they can represent a virtual environment in their brain, we trained two macaque monkeys to perform a navigation task in a virtual building and conducted behavioral analyses.","conclusion":"The second training was completed faster than the first one. Furthermore, we found that the time required for a free-way-finding test from a novel starting point was shortened after the second training. These results suggest that monkeys can navigate a virtual environment and can construct a flexible representation of a virtual environment in their brain."},{"method":"Different doses of testosterone enanthate (T) or testosterone-BSA (T-BSA) bilaterally were injected into the CA1 region of the hippocampus 15 min before shock delivery (1 mA during 5 s) in a two-compartment passive avoidance apparatus.

It was concluded that, in the first experiment, DCS had mainly improved attention and\/or encoding, and had slightly enhanced memory in the second. Any effects on memory were most likely due to prevention of forgetting. There was also evidence of anxiolytic effects of DCS that may have facilitated responses to both arms without affecting specific choices of the novel alternative."},{"method":"Rats with neonatal (postnatal day 7) or adult excitotoxic lesions or sham-lesions of the mPFC were tested 9 weeks after surgery. At postnatal day 49 one group of neonatal operated rats were systemically injected with the glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone (20 mg\/kg), in order to simulate stress-induced glucocorticoid receptor activation. Working memory and perseveration was tested in T-maze tasks (continuous delayed alternation and reversal learning).

Brain tissue damage was assessed using Nissl-staining and parvalbumine-immunocytochemistry.","background":"While prefrontal lesions in rodents serve as models for frontal lobe syndromes, neonatal lesions are considered as models for disconnection syndromes, such as schizophrenia. We investigated the effect of neonatal lesions of the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) together with pubertal dexamethasone-challenge on adult rat behaviour and on apomorphine-induced behavioural changes. Adult lesions were used as controls.","conclusion":"Pronounced thinning of the prelimbic-infralimbic subregion of the mPFC accompanied by altered cytoarchitecture and reduced number of parvalbumine-immunopositive neurones was found after neonatal lesions while adult lesions resulted in loss of neurones accompanied by gliosis. Neonatal lesions increased perseveration in the T-maze tasks and enhanced PPI, while adult lesions induced a working memory deficit. This differential behavioural outcome presumably reflects neurodevelopmentally induced alterations in neuronal circuits after neonatal lesions versus damage to mPFC alone after adult lesions. Dexamethasone-injection at day 49 did not alter behaviour in these tasks. Motor activity was not affected by neonatal or adult lesions but dexamethasone reduced apomorphine-induced hyperlocomotion."},{"method":"To test the hypothesis that histamine induces wakefulness via actions in the BF, we performed microdialysis perfusion of different concentrations of histamine (100, 500 and 1000 microM) in the BF of Sprague-Dawley rats.","background":"Histamine-containing neurons of the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) are implicated in facilitating wakefulness. They project to many brain areas, including the cholinergic basal forebrain (BF). The cholinergic magnocellular regions of the BF are important in the regulation of cortical arousal and wakefulness, and a role for histamine in this activity is suggested by in vitro data indicating histamine excites BF cholinergic and non-cholinergic neurons.","conclusion":"A MANOVA analysis showed that histamine produced a highly statistically significant and dose-dependent increase in wakefulness and decrease in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep compared with artificial cerebrospinal fluid perfusion. From a wakefulness baseline percentage time of about 12% with artificial cerebrospinal fluid, histamine perfusion increased this value to 26% (100 microM), 36% (500 microM), or 47% (1000 microM). There was no statistically significant change in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Histamine perfusion (500 microM) in a control site, the centromedian thalamic nucleus, did not produce any change in behavioral state. The results indicate a prominent role of histamine in wakefulness regulation via the BF and further support the hypothesis that the BF has an important role in EEG activation and wakefulness."},{"method":"Lister Hooded rats were trained on a spatial discrimination task (SD), which required a correct barpress matching the cue location, then they were trained on reversal of SD (SDR), which required a correct barpress opposite to the cue location. Rats with mPFc lesions showed a slower learning rate compared to the controls.","background":"Although lesion studies suggest that the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFc) is involved in the process necessary for reversal of a particular set of contingencies, the nature of lesion-induced deficits is unclear. The involvement of rat mPFc in reversal of a simple spatial discrimination was examined in the present study. Our hypothesis was that lesion-induced deficits may reflect a failure to inhibit a learned instrumental response.","conclusion":"However, behavior of the lesioned rats during early and later reversal differed. During the initial SDR, the lesioned rats showed a greater number of barpresses during the intertrial interval and a slightly higher percent correct responses than that of the controls. Our data suggest that damage to mPFc may produce a lack of response inhibition, leading to an increase in nondiscriminated bapresses, thereby yielding a 'facilitation' during early reversal. mPFc lesion did not affect either open field activity or prepulse inhibition (PPI), a frequently used measure of sensorimotor gating. Disruption of reversal learning following damage to mPFc is partly due to a failure to inhibit instrumental responses, rather than to disruption of other processes involved in sensorimotor gating or general activity."},{"method":"The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of chronic citalopram treatment on harmaline-induced tremors in rats. Female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 70+\/-2 g were given citalopram in doses of 0, 10, 20 and 40 mg\/kg by gavage for 2 weeks. On the 15th day, the rats were given harmaline (10 mg\/kg, i.p.) 30 min after the last dose of citalopram. The latency of onset, intensity and duration of tremor and EMG were recorded.

Use of these agents in depressed patients with essential tremor has not been studied.","conclusion":"Citalopram dose dependently exacerbated the duration, intensity and amplitude of EMG of harmaline-induced tremor.

In the Y-maze task requiring working memory or attention, alpha1d-AR knockout mice displayed an impaired spontaneous alternation performance. The alpha1d-AR knockout mice tended to display lower levels of acoustic startle responses than the wild-type group at lower pulse intensities, although the acoustic prepulse inhibition was not impaired in the alpha1d-AR knockout mice.

In a second set of experiments, the ability of repeated naltrexone (6 mg\/kg) administrations to modify the effects of ethanol was also assessed on mice locomotion.","background":"Several studies have pointed out that the mu opioid receptor (MOR) can play a key role in some of the behavioural effects of ethanol.","conclusion":"The results of the present study revealed that an acute naltrexone administration reduced dose-dependently ethanol-induced locomotion. Conversely, after repeated naltrexone injections, a transient boost of ethanol induced locomotor activity was observed. Thus, the results of the present study revealed that the effects of these naltrexone pretreatments on ethanol-induced locomotion are similar to the previously described changes on MOR activity. Moreover, the same (acute and chronic) naltrexone pretreatments produced similar changes on the locomotion of mice after a challenge with morphine (a MOR agonist), but not after tert-butanol (an alcohol which does not release beta-endorphins) administration.

The mnemonic effects of EPI are attributed almost exclusively to actions on amygdala noradrenergic (NE) systems. EPI also increases neuronal activity in the locus coeruleus (LC), the primary source of NE to other limbic structures that process memory such as the hippocampus (HIPP). The actions of EPI on the LC suggest that its mnemonic properties may also be mediated by influencing NE output in the HIPP.","conclusion":"EPI injection did not increase NE levels sampled from the HIPP of rats given lidocaine into the NTS. EPI injection did produce significant elevations in HIPP NE levels in animals given a control solution into the NTS prior to the EPI injection.

Autoshaping procedures induce higher post-session levels of corticosterone than in controls receiving CS and US randomly, and the enhanced post-session corticosterone levels have been attributed to the appetitive or arousal-inducing effects of autoshaping procedures. Enhanced corticosterone release can be induced by aversive stimulation or stressful situations, where it is often accompanied by higher levels of norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) in prefrontal cortex (PFC) but not in striatum (ST).","conclusion":"Post-session blood samples revealed higher corticosterone levels in the CS-US Paired group (n = 46) than in the CS-US Random control group (n = 21), and brain samples revealed higher levels of PFC NE and 5-HT in CS-US Paired group. Striatal 5-HT levels were unaltered by the autoshaping procedures. Autoshaping procedures provide for appetitive stimulation and induce an arousal-like state, as well as simultaneous stress-like changes in plasma corticosterone and monoamine levels in PFC.

The Pcmt1-\/- mice show, however, hyperactivity in the open-field test that becomes more pronounced with age, with a partial habituation with time in the chamber. Additionally, these mice demonstrate a strong thigmotaxic movement pattern. We present evidence that these phenotypes are not related to the alterations of the AdoMet\/AdoHcy ratio in the brain and thus may be a function of the accumulation of damaged proteins.

On the other hand, inactivation of cerebellar function severely impaired the acquisition of a conditioned cardiac response in the fear-related conditioning.

These findings suggest that cell cycle-related genes, induced after spinal cord injury, are involved in neuronal damage and subsequent cell death."},{"method":"We have studied cellular mechanisms underlying drug resistance in resected hippocampal tissue from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy by comparing two groups of patients, the first displaying a clinical response to the anticonvulsant carbamazepine and a second group with therapy-resistant seizures. Using patch-clamp recordings, we show that the mechanism of action of carbamazepine, use-dependent block of voltage-dependent Na(+) channels, is completely lost in carbamazepine-resistant patients.","background":"The development of resistance to pharmacological treatment is common to many human diseases. In chronic epilepsy, many patients develop resistance to anticonvulsant drug treatment during the course of their disease, with the underlying mechanisms remaining unclear.","conclusion":"Likewise, seizure activity elicited in human hippocampal slices is insensitive to carbamazepine. In marked contrast, carbamazepine-induced use-dependent block of Na(+) channels and blocked seizure activity in vitro in patients clinically responsive to this drug. Consistent with these results in human patients, we also show that use-dependent block of Na(+) channels by carbamazepine is absent in chronic experimental epilepsy. Taken together, these data suggest that a loss of Na(+) channel drug sensitivity may constitute a novel mechanism underlying the development of drug-resistant epilepsy."},{"method":"We examined this hypothesis in 11 patients with segmental and generalized dystonia undergoing microelectrode exploration of the internal globus pallidus (GPi) before pallidotomy or deep brain stimulation (DBS) implantation. The mean firing rates and firing patterns were compared with those in six patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In seven patients who underwent surgery under local anesthesia, the mean GPi firing rate was 77 Hz, similar to the 74 Hz observed in the PD patients. However, in three dystonic patients under propofol anesthesia, GPi mean firing rate was much reduced (31 Hz), and the firing pattern was distinguished by long pauses in activity, as reported by others. Low-dose propofol in one other dystonia patient also seemed to suppress GPi firing.","background":"Dystonia is a neurological syndrome involving sustained contractions of opposing muscles leading to abnormal movements and postures. Recent studies report abnormally low pallidal neuronal activity in patients with generalized dystonia, suggesting hyperkinetic disorders result from underactive basal ganglia output.","conclusion":"These results indicate that an abnormally low basal ganglia output is not the sine qua non of dystonia. The widely accepted pathophysiological models of dystonia that propose global decreases in basal ganglia output need to be viewed with caution in light of these findings."},{"method":"As previously reported, we confirmed in ALS mice that either minocycline or creatine treatment results in improvement in motor performance and extended survival.","background":"The known neuroprotective effects of minocycline and creatine in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) led us to examine whether the combination of these agents would result in increased neuroprotection.","conclusion":"We report that combination of minocycline and creatine resulted in additive neuroprotection, suggesting this to be a novel potential strategy for the treatment of ALS. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating additive neuroprotection of a combinatorial approach in a mouse model of ALS. Adding relevancy to our findings, minocycline and creatine, are relatively safe, cross the blood-brain barrier, and are currently available for human evaluation."},{"method":"She had a severe encephalopathy, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed large subependymal cysts and no basal ganglia lesions.","background":"We report a case of neonatal congenital lactic acidosis associated with pyruvate dehydrogenase E3-binding protein deficiency in a newborn girl.","conclusion":"She died 35 days after birth.

Creatine has been shown to be effective in several animal models of neurodegenerative diseases and currently is being evaluated in early stage trials in PD. Similarly, coenzyme Q(10) is also effective in animal models and has shown promising effects both in clinical trials of PD as well as in clinical trials in Huntington's disease and Friedreich's ataxia.","background":"There is considerable evidence suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage may play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). This possibility has been strengthened by recent studies in animal models, which have shown that a selective inhibitor of complex I of the electron transport gene can produce an animal model that closely mimics both the biochemical and histopathological findings of PD. Several agents are available that can modulate cellular energy metabolism and that may exert antioxidative effects. There is substantial evidence that mitochondria are a major source of free radicals within the cell. These appear to be produced at both the iron-sulfur clusters of complex I as well as the ubiquinone site.","conclusion":"Many other agents show good human tolerability. These agents therefore are promising candidates for further study as neuroprotective agents in PD."},{"method":"Oxidative stress can impair these processes directly, and products of oxidative damage, such as HNE, can damage the 26S proteasome. Furthermore, impairment of proteasomal function leads to free radical generation and oxidative stress.","background":"Oxidative stress contributes to the cascade leading to dopamine cell degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, oxidative stress is intimately linked to other components of the degenerative process, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, nitric oxide toxicity and inflammation. It is therefore difficult to determine whether oxidative stress leads to, or is a consequence of, these events. Oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA occurs in PD, and toxic products of oxidative damage, such as 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), can react with proteins to impair cell viability. There is convincing evidence for the involvement of nitric oxide that reacts with superoxide to produce peroxynitrite and ultimately hydroxyl radical production. Recently, altered ubiquitination and degradation of proteins have been implicated as key to dopaminergic cell death in PD.","conclusion":"Oxidative stress occurs in idiopathic PD and products of oxidative damage interfere with cellular function, but these form only part of a cascade, and it is not possible to separate them from other events involved in dopaminergic cell death."},{"method":"To determine whether early-life insults that lead to epilepsy result in similar structural changes, we subjected rat pups to lithium-pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus during postnatal development (day 20) and examined them as adults for the occurrence of spontaneous seizures and alterations in hippocampal morphology.","background":"Prolonged early-life seizures are considered potential risk factors for later epilepsy development, but mediators of this process remain largely unknown. Seizure-induced structural damage in hippocampus, including cell loss and mossy fiber sprouting, is thought to contribute to the hyperexcitability characterizing epilepsy, but a causative role has not been established.","conclusion":"Sixty-seven percent of rats developed spontaneous seizures after status epilepticus, yet only one third of these epileptic animals exhibited visible hippocampal cell loss or mossy fiber sprouting in dentate gyrus. Most epileptic rats had no apparent structural alterations in the hippocampus detectable using standard light microscopy methods (profile counts and Timm's staining). These results suggest that hippocampal cell loss and mossy fiber sprouting can occur after early-life status epilepticus but may not be necessary prerequisites for epileptogenesis in the developing brain."},{"method":"In an ADPEAF family, a novel mutation in the Lgi1 signal peptide is predicted to interfere with the protein cell sorting, resulting in altered processing.","background":"Autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder.

Because evidence suggests that multiple pathways may contribute to ALS pathogenesis, we tested in a mouse model of ALS (SOD1(G37R) mice) a combination approach consisting of three drugs for distinct targets in the complex pathway to neuronal death: minocycline, an antimicrobial agent that inhibits microglial activation, riluzole, a glutamate antagonist, and nimodipine, a voltage-gated calcium channel blocker.","conclusion":"It delayed the onset of disease, slowed the loss of muscle strength, and increased the average longevity of SOD1(G37R) mice by 6 weeks. The protective effect of the treatment was corroborated by the reduced immunodetection signals for markers of gliosis and neurodegeneration in the spinal cord of SOD1(G37R) mice.

However, we do not know whether specific insular fields are involved in disgust processing nor what the processing time course is.","conclusion":"We showed that specific potentials to disgust beginning 300 milliseconds after stimulus onset and lasting 200 milliseconds were evoked in the ventral anterior insula in four patients. The occurrence and latency of event-related potentials to disgust in the ventral anterior insula were affected by selective attention. The analysis of spatial and temporal characteristics of insular responses to disgust facial expression lead us to underline the crucial role of ventral anterior insula in the categorization of facial emotional expressions, particularly the disgust."},{"method":"Therefore, we evaluated anti-GM1 IgG antibody-induced leukocyte effector functions such as degranulation and phagocytosis using serum of 24 GBS patients.

An important pathogenic role for anti-GM1 ganglioside antibodies has been suggested.","conclusion":"Ten out of 15 (67%) of anti-GM1 IgG positive sera were capable of inducing leukocyte degranulation, and 8 out of 15 (53%) of anti-GM1 IgG positive sera were capable of inducing phagocytosis of GM1-coated beads. In all of these sera anti-GM1 antibody titers were &gt;or=1:800. No leukocyte degranulation or phagocytosis was observed in control sera. Leukocyte activation was completely abrogated in the presence of IgG receptor (FcgammaR) blocking antibodies, suggesting a crucial role for leukocyte FcgammaR in GBS pathogenesis. No correlation of antibody titers with the extent of leukocyte activation, or severity of disease was observed.

Similarly, mutations in two enzymes involved in the normal function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, parkin and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1, are also associated with hereditary PD. Furthermore, structural and function defects in 26\/20S proteasomes with accumulation and aggregation of potentially cytotoxic abnormal proteins have been identified in the substantia nigra pars compacta of patients with sporadic PD. Thus, a defect in protein handling appears to be a common factor in sporadic and the various familial forms of PD.

In support, antagonists at AMPA\/kainate glutamate receptors, NBQX and CNQX, blocked the interleukin-1beta toxicity to oligodendrocytes. Another microglia\/macrophage cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, also evoked apoptosis of oligodendrocytes in a mixed glia environment in an NBQX-blockable manner.","background":"Glutamate excitotoxicity is implicated in the progressive loss of oligodendrocytes in multiple sclerosis, but how glutamate metabolism is dysregulated in the disease remains unclear.

On the CRST, rest, postural and kinetic tremor scores were all higher in the male carriers. The elevated total UPDRS and ICARS scores mainly resulted from markedly higher scores for tremor and limb ataxia, respectively. The female carrier (n = 14) and control groups (n = 8) did not differ on any measure. The FMR1 premutation is associated with increased levels of CGG repeat-containing FMR1 mRNA, which may predispose to these symptoms by interfering with nuclear mechanisms.

In TDN, most cases manifested a motor-dominant and acutely progressive pattern, with impairment of both superficial and deep sensation. Small-fiber-predominant axonal loss in sural nerve specimens was characteristic of ALN, especially with a short history of neuropathy; long history was associated with regenerating small fibers. Large-fiber-predominant axonal loss predominated in TDN. Subperineurial edema was more prominent in TDN, whereas segmental de\/remyelination resulting from widening of consecutive nodes of Ranvier was more frequent in ALN. Myelin irregularity was greater in ALN. ALN-TD showed a variable mixture of these features in ALN and TDN. We concluded that pure-form of alcoholic neuropathy (ALN) was distinct from pure-form of thiamine-deficiency neuropathy (TDN), supporting the view that alcoholic neuropathy can be caused by direct toxic effect of ethanol or its metabolites.

Stimulation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) by elevated levels of ACh plays a role in the effects of AChE inhibitors on cognition and behavior. However, AChE inhibitors only demonstrate modest symptomatic improvements.

In addition, mAChRs showed decreased presynaptic, cell surface, and dendritic distributions and increased localization to intracellular puncta. Furthermore, mAChR agonist-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, a signaling pathway associated with synaptic plasticity and amyloidogenesis, is diminished in the hippocampus and cortex of AChE -\/- mice. Therefore, chronic diminished ACh metabolism produces profound effects on mAChR expression and function.

Its product, tetrahydrobiopterin, has higher affinity to tyrosine hydroxylase among hydroxylases. Thus, partial deficiency of tetrahydrobiopterin caused by heterozygous mutation of the GCH-I gene decreases dopamine activity rather selectively. This affects the DA receptors that mature early and demonstrates characteristic symptoms age-dependently along with the developmental decrement of the tyrosine hydroxylase activities at the terminals and the maturational processes of the projecting neurons of the basal ganglia.

Intellectual functions are mostly compromised. Prenatally disturbed brain development and postnatal growth failure were observed. Treatment with levodopa ameliorates but usually does not normalize symptoms. Compared with patients with dominantly inherited GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency, catecholaminergic neurotransmission is severely and constantly impaired in TH deficiency. In most patients, this results not in predominating dystonia, a largely nondegenerative condition, but in a progressive often lethal neurometabolic disorder, which can be improved but not cured by L-dopa.

Thus, even in the adult, the olfactory epithelium contains neurons at various developmental stages.","conclusion":"Compared with age-matched controls, there were far fewer mature ORNs, as defined by olfactory marker protein expression, and significantly greater numbers of immature neuron-specific tubulin-positive ORNs present. In RTT biopsies, olfactory marker protein-positive neurons displayed abnormal structure. These results suggest that dysfunction of MeCP2 results in decreased survival of mature ORNs with a compensatory increase in neurogenesis, or a failure of immature neurons to mature.

This result demonstrates that infarction of the left POp is associated with a chronic change in function of the contralateral homotopic cortex during speech."},{"method":"Using an aphasia score developed for each language modality, language was evaluated within 6 hours after onset, then sequentially during the first week. Maps of the penumbra and infarct obtained from P-CT images and definite infarct size evaluated using T2 and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) on day 3 were rated by a neuroradiologist, blinded to the clinical deficit.","background":"During the first few hours after onset, stroke symptoms may evolve rapidly. We studied the correlation between brain perfusion and aphasia changes during the hyperacute phase of stroke using a new technique of perfusion computed tomography (P-CT).","conclusion":"Within 6 hours, deficits in all language modalities were present in 13 out of 24 consecutive patients, corresponding to large anterior-posterior perfusion deficits of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. The aphasia score correlated with a corresponding perfusion deficit in specific areas of the MCA territory, and showed significantly less improvement when the penumbra evolved toward infarction than when at least part of the penumbra was rescued. Our findings suggest a particularly good correlation between the evolution of aphasic symptoms and penumbra dynamics. Further studies on the relevance of penumbra dynamics in function-specific brain areas to decision taking in hyperacute stroke management are required."},{"method":"We tested the second-generation azulenyl nitrone, stilbazunenlyl nitrone (STAZN), in focal ischemic stroke.

STAZN treatment reduced mean cortical infarct volume by 64-97%, and total infarct volume by 42-72%. In over one-half of STAZN-treated animals, cortical infarction was virtually abolished. Regression analysis predicted that STAZN would confer approximately 50% cortical neuroprotection even in the most severely affected cases. The potency of STAZN was orders-of-magnitude greater than other nitrones such as NXY-059.

However, transplantation of NPCs into the striatum by current methods has had limited success. It is possible to reverse the symptoms of PD in model rats but difficult to reverse them in humans because the number of dopaminergic neurons generated from NPCs is low.","conclusion":"Numerous bromodeoxyuridine-tyrosine hydroxylase double-labeled cells were seen close to the transplant site, showing that the transplanted cells efficiently generated new dopaminergic neurons within the host striatum. Moreover, all of the animals with NPCs with VHL showed a remarkable decrease in apomorphine-induced rotations. These findings show that NPCs with the VHL gene can efficiently generate dopaminergic neurons and that a sufficient number of dopaminergic neurons can develop from them to reverse the symptoms of PD in humans.

One homozygous missense mutation and one heterozygous mutation were found in two YOPD samples. In addition, several variants were found in the coding sequence of the gene, which are likely to represent polymorphisms. In one case, the polymorphism was population specific. The reported 14Kbp deletion was not found in any of our samples or controls. We confirm the presence of pathogenic DJ-1 mutations in YOPD and estimate their frequency at approximately 1%.

We hypothesized that, if activity in the intact hemisphere contributes to functional recovery, TMS should result in abnormal motor behavior in the paretic hand.","background":"It has been proposed that the intact (ipsilateral) motor cortex play a significant role mediating recovery of motor function in the paretic hand of chronic stroke patients, but this hypothesis has not been tested experimentally.","conclusion":"We found that stimulation of the intact hemisphere resulted in delayed simple reaction times (RTs) in the contralateral healthy but not in the ipsilateral paretic hand, whereas stimulation of the lesioned hemisphere led to a marked delay in RT in the contralateral paretic hand but not in the ipsilateral healthy hand. RT delays in the paretic hand correlated well with functional recovery. Finger tapping in the paretic hand was affected by TMS of the lesioned but not the intact hemisphere. These results are consistent with the idea that recovered motor function in the paretic hand of chronic stroke patients relies predominantly on reorganized activity within motor areas of the affected hemisphere."},{"method":"This longitudinal study contrasts change of memory and nonmemory functions in 147 surgically and 102 medically treated patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.

Data were analyzed on an individual and group level.","background":"It remains unclear whether uncontrolled epilepsy causes mental decline.","conclusion":"Sixty-three percent of the surgical and 12% of the medically treated patients were seizure-free at T3. Fifty percent of the medically treated and 60% of the surgical patients showed significant memory decline at T3 with little change in nonmemory functions (difference not significant). Surgery anticipated the decline seen in the medically treated group and exceeded it when surgery was performed on the left, or if seizures continued postoperatively. Seizure-free surgical patients showed recovery of nonmemory functions at T2 (p &lt; 0.001) and of memory functions at T3 (T3, p = 0.03). Multiple regression indicated retest interval, seizure control, and mental reserve capacity as predictors of performance changes. In addition, psychosocial outcome was better when seizures were controlled. In conclusion, chronic temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with progressive memory impairment. Surgery, particularly if unsuccessful, accelerates this decline. However, memory decline may be stopped and even reversed if seizures are fully controlled."},{"method":"Twenty-four MTLE cases with histopathologically definite hippocampal sclerosis were examined for clearly defined features of microdysgenesis and further signs of neocortical dysplasia.","background":"The interrelationship of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), hippocampal sclerosis, and febrile convulsions still remains an enigma.

The features of microdysgenesis studied here were not linked with each other and were not related to initial precipitating injuries, positive family history, or any other clinical parameter.

The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of epilepsy and antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment on cognitive functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in these patients.","conclusion":"Eighty-six percent of the patients had epilepsy and 50% of those using AEDs actually were seizure-free. Compared with healthy controls, glioma patients had significant reductions in information processing speed, psychomotor function, attentional functioning, verbal and working memory, executive functioning, and HRQOL. The increase in epilepsy burden that was associated with significant reductions in all cognitive domains except for attentional and memory functioning could primarily be attributed to the use of AEDs, whereas the decline in HRQOL could be ascribed to the lack of complete seizure control.

Among these sites, we identified a lateral cortical temporoparietal area we called the temporo-peri-Sylvian vestibular cortex (TPSVC), from which vestibular symptoms, and above all rotatory sensations, were particularly easily elicited (24\/41 cortical sites, 58.5%). This area extended above and below the Sylvian fissure, mainly inside Brodmann areas 40, 21, and 22. It included the parietal operculum (9\/24 TPSVC sites) which was particularly sensitive for eliciting pitch plane illusions, and the mid and posterior part of the first and second temporal gyri (15\/24 TPSVC sites) which preferentially caused yaw plane illusions.

Although a centromeric copy of the survival motor neuron gene (SMN2) is retained in all patients with SMA, it differs from SMN1 at a critical nucleotide such that the majority of SMN2 transcripts lack exon 7 and encode an unstable, truncated protein.","conclusion":"Valproic acid and related compounds warrant further investigation as potential treatment for SMA."},{"method":"This disorder showed extensive tau neuropathology, and both had a novel homozygous S352L tau gene mutation.","background":"We present the clinicopathological features of two siblings from a consanguineous marriage who presented with respiratory hypoventilation and died 10 days and 4 years later, respectively.","conclusion":"This is the first description of a pathologically proved young-onset tauopathy with apparent recessive inheritance."},{"method":"To investigate the role of tPA and microglia during brain hemorrhage, we induced experimentally ICH by intracerebral injection of collagenase. Seven days after the introduction of ICH, it persisted in tPA-deficient (tPA(-\/-)) mice but is drastically reduced in size in wild-type mice. Three weeks after ICH, there are still red blood cells in tPA(-\/-) but not in wild-type animals. Activated microglia persist around the injury site. When microglial activation is inhibited by tuftsin fragment 1-3 macrophage\/microglial inhibitory factor (MIF), the stroke injury volume is significantly reduced, and the neurobehavioral deficits exhibited by the mice are improved.","background":"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) causes morbidity and mortality and commonly follows the reperfusion after an ischemic event. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a fibrinolytic serine protease, is routinely given for the treatment of stroke. However, tPA also can promote neuronal death, suggesting that caution should be exercised when using it. Furthermore, tPA upon brain injury mediates microglial activation and modulates neuronal survival.","conclusion":"Our results suggest that endogenous tPA assists in the clearance of intracerebral hemorrhage, presumably by affecting microglial activation, and MIF could be a valuable neuroprotective agent for the treatment of ICH."},{"method":"We identified a novel EA2 kindred in which members had ataxic spells induced by fevers or high environmental temperature.

Ataxic spells lasting minutes to hours are provoked by stress, exercise, or alcohol. Some patients exhibit nystagmus between spells and some develop progressive ataxia later in life. At least 21 distinct CACNA1A mutations have been identified in EA2. The clinical and genetic complexities of EA2 have offered few insights into the underlying pathogenic mechanisms for this disorder.","conclusion":"Moreover, we found that, regardless of age or interictal clinical status, all affected subjects had objective evidence of abnormal saccades, ocular fixation, and postural stability. These findings suggest that early cerebellar dysfunction in EA2 results from the intrinsically abnormal properties of the CACNA1A channel rather than a degenerative process."},{"method":"To study this neuronal and non-neuronal cells were transfected with either wild type or mutant spastin proteins. We demonstrated evidence of a transient interaction of wild-type spastin with microtubules, with resulting disassembly of microtubules, supporting a role for wild-type spastin as a microtubule-severing protein. Mutant spastin demonstrated an abnormal interaction with microtubules, colocalizing with but no longer severing microtubules.","background":"The commonest cause of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is mutation in the spastin gene. Both the normal function of spastin in the central nervous system and the mechanism by which mutation in spastin causes axonal degeneration are unknown. One hypothesis is that mutant spastin disrupts microtubule dynamics, causing an impairment of organelle transport on the microtubule network, which leads to degeneration in the distal parts of long axons.","conclusion":"The abnormal interaction of mutant spastin with microtubules was demonstrated to be associated with an abnormal perinuclear clustering of mitochondria and peroxisomes, suggestive of an impairment of kinesin-mediated intracellular transport. Our findings indicate that an abnormal interaction of mutant spastin with microtubules, which disrupts organelle transport on the microtubule cytoskeleton, is likely to be the primary disease mechanism in HSP caused by missense mutations in the spastin gene."},{"method":"Chromosome mapping indicated a mutation on 1p36, and this recessive disorder has been designated spinocerebellar ataxia with saccadic intrusions.","background":"We describe a family of Slovenian descent with progressive ataxia, corticospinal signs, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, and disruption of visual fixation by saccadic intrusions.","conclusion":"Affected patients showed overshooting horizontal saccades, macrosaccadic oscillations, and increased velocity of larger saccades; other eye movements were normal.

Microglial cells also expressed cytokine receptors at similar levels. Cytokine expression was invariably a feature of microglial cells, except for IL-10, which was exclusively astrocytic. Oligodendrocytes did not display cytokines, except for low levels of IL-18. Although no pattern was specific for MS, most molecules were upregulated in MS and OND. Downstream JAK\/STAT molecules were correspondingly upregulated.

MS patients have increased numbers of CRH-immunoreactive neurons coexpressing vasopressin (CRH\/VP neurons), a sign of chronic activation of CRH neurons and increased CRH mRNA expression. Active MS lesions correlated with a low number of hyperactive CRH\/VP neurons. High human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, -DP, -DQ expression, a measure for macrophage and microglial activation, correlated with low CRH mRNA expression. The nearer the HLA expression was situated to the CRH neurons, the stronger the inhibiting effect, suggesting that activated microglial cells or macrophages suppress these neurons.","background":"In this postmortem study, we investigated the relationship between multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in the hypothalamus and the state of activity of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-producing neurons that control the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.","conclusion":"The more active MS lesions were present in the hypothalamus, the shorter was the disease duration until the moment of death, indicating an unfavorable course of the disease. Thus, MS patients have a chronically activated CRH system, but, in the subgroup of patients with active MS lesions in the hypothalamus, this activation is impaired and the disease course is worse."},{"method":"We reviewed the diagnostic value of these two studies in the evaluation of AMC over a 23-year period, analyzing 38 patients with AMC who had NCS\/EMG, muscle biopsy, or both. Final diagnoses were classified as neurogenic (8 patients), myopathic (10 patients), \"other\" (12 patients), or unknown (8 patients).","background":"Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC), a clinical syndrome characterized by multiple congenital joint contractures, frequently is caused by lesions in the peripheral nervous system. Two standard tests for the evaluation of the motor unit are nerve conduction studies\/electromyography (NCS\/EMG) and muscle biopsy.","conclusion":"Neither test alone had consistently high sensitivities, positive predictive values, or specificities. However, when NCS\/EMG and muscle biopsy were concordant for neurogenic or myopathic findings, they were more accurate than either test alone, especially for neurogenic diseases. Test results were most commonly discordant in patients with \"other\" or unknown diagnoses. These findings suggest that when the clinical evaluation indicates a specific syndromic, developmental, or exogenous cause, NCS\/EMG and muscle biopsy are not helpful and may not need to be performed. When the history, examination, and genetic evaluation are unrevealing, NCS\/EMG and muscle biopsy together provide valuable diagnostic information."},{"method":"In addition, transmission electron microscopy of the cutaneous vasculature revealed the mean smooth muscle cell layer of the terminal arterioles to be significantly higher compared with ischemic stroke patients classified by vascular risk factors.","background":"We highlight the first case to our knowledge of vascular parkinsonism with angiographic moyamoya and functional imaging correlates.","conclusion":"Smooth muscle cell thickness was also greater in those with small vessel and large vessel strokes compared with cardioembolic strokes.

Biochemically, it is characterized by an accumulation and enhanced urinary excretion of two key organic acids, glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid. If untreated, acute striatal degeneration is often precipitated by febrile illnesses during a vulnerable period of brain development in infancy or early childhood, resulting in a dystonic dyskinetic movement disorder.","conclusion":"3-Hydroxyglutaric and glutaric acids share structural similarities with the main excitatory amino acid glutamate and are considered to play an important role in the pathophysiology of this disease. 3-Hydroxyglutaric acid induces excitotoxic cell damage specifically via activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Furthermore, glutaric and 3-hydroxyglutaric acids indirectly modulate glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, resulting in an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. It also has been suggested that secondary amplification loops potentiate the neurotoxic properties of these organic acids. Probable mechanisms for this effect include cytokine-stimulated nitric oxide production, a decrease in energy metabolism, and reduction of cellular creatine phosphate levels. Finally, maturation-dependent changes in the expression of neuronal glutamate receptors may affect the vulnerability to 3-hydroxyglutaric and glutaric acid toxicity."},{"method":"We report the first four cases of infantile mitochondrial encephalopathies caused by mutations in the ND3 subunit gene.

Respiratory chain complex I deficiency is the most common energy generation disorder and a frequent cause of infantile mitochondrial encephalopathies such as Leigh's disease and lethal infantile mitochondrial disease. Most such cases have been assumed to be caused by nuclear gene defects, but recently an increasing number have been shown to be caused by mutations in the mitochondrially encoded complex I subunit genes ND4, ND5, and ND6.","conclusion":"Both mutations cause disproportionately greater reductions in enzyme activity than in the amount of fully assembled complex I, suggesting the ND3 subunit plays an unknown but important role in electron transport, proton pumping, or ubiquinone binding. Three cases appear to have a de novo mutation, with no mutation detected in maternal relatives.

They also exhibited impaired intermediate and long-term memory but spared short-term memory in the inhibitory avoidance task. Three hours after inhibitory avoidance training, phosphorylation of cAMP response-element binding (CREB) protein in the hippocampus was significantly lower in nine-FS-group rats than in controls. Furthermore, rolipram administration, which activated the cAMP-CREB signaling pathway by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type IV, reversed the long-term memory deficits in nine-FS-group rats by enhancing hippocampal CREB phosphorylation.

Such a biochemical divergence may be related to the neuropathological features of these diseases."},{"method":"When the group was divided into symptomatic and asymptomatic subgroups, based on either clinical history or residual urea synthetic capacity, the asymptomatic subgroup outperformed the symptomatic subgroup on all tested domains of neuropsychological functioning. Furthermore, the amount of residual urea synthetic capacity was predictive of several end point cognitive measures.

Although as a group, these women had average IQ scores, they displayed a specific neuropsychological phenotype with significant strengths in verbal intelligence, verbal learning, verbal memory, and reading, and significant weaknesses in fine motor dexterity\/speed and nonsignificant weaknesses in nonverbal intelligence, visual memory, attention\/executive skills, and math. This suggests selective vulnerability of white matter and better preservation of gray matter.","conclusion":"In sum, we identified a specific metabolic and neurocognitive phenotype in women heterozygous for ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.

Activation of cytokine receptors and oxidative stress can induce the production of ceramide from membrane sphingomyelin, and recent findings suggest that ceramide is an important mediator of a form of programmed cell death called apoptosis.","conclusion":"These results suggest that HIV-1 infection may promote a lipid imbalance in neural cells, resulting in an overproduction of ceramide and consequent cellular dysfunction and death."},{"method":"In addition, a pharmacological study using the hormones progesterone, 17 beta-estradiol, mifepristone (intracellular progesterone receptor antagonist), tamoxifen (intracellular estrogen receptor antagonist), and allopregnanolone (progesterone metabolite) was performed to determine their effects on AY-induced seizures.","background":"A time course study that examined the effects of the female estrous cycle on the chronic slow spike-and-wave discharges (SSWDs), gamma-aminobutyric B receptor (GABA(B)R) binding, and GABA(B)R protein expression was conducted in Long Evans hooded rats treated during development with a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor AY9944 (AY).","conclusion":"The data indicate that there is a significant increase in both the duration of SSWD and GABA(B)R binding in the AY model, during the proestrus stage of the estrous cycle, the stage during which the levels of progesterone are at their highest. No changes in GABA(B)R1a or R2 protein levels were observed. In addition, the administration of both progesterone and allopregnanolone exacerbated seizures in the AY model, whereas 17 beta-estradiol attenuated the SSWD duration. Neither mifepristone nor tamoxifen blocked the effects of progesterone and 17 beta-estradiol, respectively, on SSWD duration in the AY model, suggesting that these two sex hormones are working in a manner independent of their intracellular receptors. These data suggest an important role for steroid hormones in the regulation and maintenance of AY-induced atypical absence seizures."},{"method":"We report here the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis in a patient with SMS, breast cancer, and antibodies that recognize both brain and muscle amphiphysin isoforms. Immunotherapy induced a remission of both rhabdomyolysis and SMS symptoms.","background":"Stiff-Man syndrome (SMS) is a rare disease of the central nervous system characterized by chronic muscle rigidity and autoimmunity directed against synaptic antigens. In a subset of patients, generally positive for antiamphiphysin autoantibodies, SMS has an autoimmune paraneoplastic origin. Amphiphysin isoforms are expressed at high levels in brain and skeletal muscle and often are overexpressed in breast cancer.","conclusion":"Autoimmune rhabdomyolysis may represent a paraneoplastic complication of cancer patients with amphiphysin autoimmunity."},{"method":"We focused on Tat, a viral protein released from HIV-1-infected cells and investigated its effect on spatial learning in adult mice. An intracerebroventricular injection of Tat leads to attenuation of spatial learning accompanied by suppression of long-term potentiation (LTP), the cellular basis of spatial learning, in hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 pyramidal neurons. Tat facilitates extrasynaptic but not synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity.","background":"Although memory deficits have been clearly documented in patients with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection, the physiological basis of this dysfunction is poorly understood.","conclusion":"Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that the Tat pathway underlies the development of memory dysfunction in patients with HIV-1 infection and suggest a causal relationship between Tat, the facilitation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptor activity, inhibition of LTP, and attenuation of spatial learning."},{"method":"Brain tissue available from affected individuals in both kindreds provided the opportunity to compare their clinical, pathological, and biochemical phenotypes. Of note, studies of brain mRNA and soluble protein levels demonstrate a doubling of alpha-synuclein expression, consistent with molecular genetic data.","background":"Genomic triplication of the alpha-synuclein gene recently has been associated with familial Parkinson's disease in the Spellman-Muenter kindred. Here, we present an independent family, of Swedish-American descent, with hereditary early-onset parkinsonism with dementia due to alpha-synuclein triplication.","conclusion":"Pathologically, cornu ammonis 2\/3 hippocampal neuronal loss appears to be a defining feature of this form of inherited parkinsonism. The profound implications of alpha-synuclein overexpression for idiopathic synucleinopathies are discussed."},{"method":"Here, we studied interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) between M1(intact hemisphere) and M1(lesioned hemisphere) in the process of generation of a voluntary movement by the paretic hand in patients with chronic subcortical stroke and in healthy volunteers. IHI was evaluated in both hands preceding the onset of unilateral voluntary index finger movements (paretic hand in patients, right hand in controls) in a simple reaction time paradigm.","background":"In patients with chronic stroke, the primary motor cortex of the intact hemisphere (M1(intact hemisphere)) may influence functional recovery, possibly through transcallosal effects exerted over M1 in the lesioned hemisphere (M1(lesioned hemisphere)).","conclusion":"IHI at rest and shortly after the Go signal were comparable in patients and controls. Closer to movement onset, IHI targeting the moving index finger turned into facilitation in controls but remained deep in patients, a finding that correlated with poor motor performance. These results document an abnormally high interhemispheric inhibitory drive from M1(intact hemisphere) to M1(lesioned hemisphere) in the process of generation of a voluntary movement by the paretic hand. It is conceivable that this abnormality could adversely influence motor recovery in some patients with subcortical stroke, an interpretation consistent with models of interhemispheric competition in motor and sensory systems."},{"method":"We used ionizing radiation to decrease neural regeneration, and 2 weeks later cerebral global ischemia was induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. One month after the occlusion, the animals were behaviorally tested.","background":"Increased neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia suggests that functional recovery after stroke may be attributed, in part, to neural regeneration. In this study, we investigated the role of neurogenesis in the behavioral performance of gerbils after cerebral global ischemia.","conclusion":"Irradiation alone reduced neurogenesis but did not change vascular or dendritic morphology at the time of behavioral testing. Neither did irradiation, ischemia, or combined treatment impair rotor-rod performance or alter open-field activity. Gerbils subjected to both irradiation and ischemia demonstrated impaired performance in the water-maze task, compared with those that received only ischemia, radiation, or no treatment. These impairments after cerebral global ischemia under conditions of reduced neurogenesis support a role for the production of new cells in mediating functional recovery."},{"method":"Using functional magnetic resonance imaging to elucidate the neural correlates of such perceptual extinction, we found that limb position modulated neural responses to tactile stimuli at early cortical stages (SI) in the intact hemisphere.","background":"We studied a patient with right parietal damage for whom tactile stimuli on the right\/ipsilesional hand (projecting to the intact left hemisphere) were extinguished from awareness during double simultaneous stimulation, when his right hand was positioned in the left\/contralesional space. This demonstrates the role of an egocentric spatial reference frame in attention that can determine awareness of stimuli despite intact sensory pathways.","conclusion":"Activity in bilateral middle frontal gyri also was modulated by limb position and may contribute to integrate sensory inputs into a supramodal, egocentric representation of space."},{"method":"Forty-five patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent surgical resection in the Comprehensive Epilepsy Program at the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre completed a semistructured interview and questionnaire relating to sexual outcome after surgery. Volumetric analyses of both amygdalae were conducted on the patients' preoperative T(1)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans and those of 46 neurologically normal controls.","background":"The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between the amygdala and human sex drive. We compared amygdalar volume in groups of patients with or without sexual changes after temporal lobe resection and in age-matched neurologically normal subjects.","conclusion":"Patients who reported a postoperative sexual increase had a significantly larger amygdalar volume contralateral to the site of their resective surgery than patients with a sexual decrease or no change than control subjects. There was a significant positive relationship between contralateral amygdalar volume and the maximum degree of sexual change. We have demonstrated a relationship between contralateral amygdalar volume and sexual outcome in patients undergoing temporal lobe resection. This finding provides evidence for an important role of the amygdala in regulating human sexual behavior. A larger contralateral amygdala may contribute to the expression of increased or improved sexuality after temporal lobe resection."},{"method":"A cohort of 662 pairs of Swedish twins 52 to 98 years of age who were without symptoms of dementia was followed up for an average of 5 years. Incident dementia cases were detected through follow-up at 2 to 3-year intervals using either cognitive testing or telephone screening followed by dementia workups. A physician, psychologist, and nurse gave consensus diagnoses.","background":"Although genetic effects are known to be important for early onset Alzheimer's disease, little is known about the importance of genetic effects for late-onset disease. Furthermore, previous studies are based on prevalent cases. Our purpose was to characterize the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors for incident Alzheimer's disease late in life, and to test for differences in the importance of genetic effects at different ages.","conclusion":"During the follow-up period, 5.8% of the sample was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Average age of onset was 83.9 years (standard deviation, 6.3). Of the 26 monozygotic pairs in which at least one twin developed Alzheimer's disease, 5 were concordant (probandwise concordance, 32.2%). The concordance rate for dizygotic pairs was 8.7% (2 of 44 pairs). Structural model fitting indicated that 48% of the variation in liability to Alzheimer's disease could be attributed to genetic variation. Estimates did not differ significantly between twins younger than age 80 years and those older than age 80 years at baseline. Although these genetic estimates for incident disease are lower than those for prevalent disease, the importance of genetic factors for liability to Alzheimer's disease is considerable even late in life."},{"method":"Expression and phosphorylation of DAP kinase was significantly increased in epilepsy brain compared with control. DAP kinase and DAP kinase-interacting protein 1 (DIP-1) localized to mitochondria in control brain, whereas levels of both were increased in the cytoplasm and microsomal (endoplasmic reticulum) fraction in epilepsy samples. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed increased DAP kinase binding to calmodulin, DIP-1, and the Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) in epilepsy samples. Finally, immunohistochemistry determined DAP kinase was coexpressed with DIP-1 in neurons.","background":"Experimental and human data suggest programmed (active) cell death may contribute to the progressive hippocampal atrophy seen in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. Death-associated protein (DAP) kinase is a novel calcium\/calmodulin-activated kinase that functions in apoptosis mediated by death receptors. Because seizure-induced neuronal death involves both death receptor activation and calcium, we examined DAP kinase expression, localization, and interactions in hippocampal resections from patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (n = 10) and autopsy controls (n = 6).","conclusion":"This study provides the first description of DAP kinase and DIP-1 in human brain and suggests DAP kinase is a novel molecular regulator of neuronal death in epilepsy."},{"method":"To investigate EAAT2b biology in pathological conditions, we examined the cellular and regional distribution of EAAT2b in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Using epitope-specific, affinity purified antibodies, we found that EAAT2b tissue levels were increased by more than twofold in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis motor cortex, whereas EAAT2 levels were decreased by up to 95%.","background":"Functional studies suggest that up to 95% of all glutamate transport is handled by the glutamate transporter EAAT2. Amino and C-terminal antibodies demonstrate that under normal conditions EAAT2 is specific to astrocytes. A truncated splice variant of EAAT2, known as EAAT2b, also has been identified in astrocytes and some neurons. In vitro studies suggest EAAT2b transports glutamate similar to EAAT2, although the contribution of EAAT2b to normal clearance of extracellular glutamate is unknown.","conclusion":"EAAT2b distribution in normal human cortex was largely confined to the neuropil-like EAAT2, with occasional faint neuronal expression. In contrast, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis motor cortex had an obvious qualitative increase in neuropil EAAT2b staining and a drastic increase in neuronal soma and dendritic EAAT2b immunostaining. Despite these increases in EAAT2b immunostaining, functional transporter studies demonstrated a large loss of EAAT2 function. These studies clearly document altered regulation and splicing of the dominant glutamate transporter EAAT2 under conditions of neurological stress."},{"method":"Using oligonucleotide microarrays, we identified a statistically significant transcriptional signature of 1,109 genes in PBMCs from 26 MS patients, irrespective of disease activation state or immunomodulatory treatment. This signature contains genes that implicate underlying processes involved in MS pathogenesis including T-cell activation and expansion, inflammation, and apoptosis. Another transcriptional signature of 721 genes involved in cellular recruitment, epitope spreading, and escape from regulatory immune surveillance identified MS patients in acute relapse compared with remission.","background":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system disease with an unpredictable course and outcome. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are involved in the disease pathogenesis and induce active demyelination.","conclusion":"Our results offer new opportunity for understanding the mechanisms involved in MS and indicate that gene expression patterns in PBMCs contain information about a remote-target disease process that may be useful for diagnosis and future tailoring of therapeutic strategies for MS."},{"method":"Compared with controls, AD patients typically showed marked retention of PIB in areas of association cortex known to contain large amounts of amyloid deposits in AD. In the AD patient group, PIB retention was increased most prominently in frontal cortex (1.94-fold, p = 0.0001). Large increases also were observed in parietal (1.71-fold, p = 0.0002), temporal (1.52-fold, p = 0.002), and occipital (1.54-fold, p = 0.002) cortex and the striatum (1.76-fold, p = 0.0001). PIB retention was equivalent in AD patients and controls in areas known to be relatively unaffected by amyloid deposition (such as subcortical white matter, pons, and cerebellum). Studies in three young (21 years) and six older healthy controls (69.5 +\/- 11 years) showed low PIB retention in cortical areas and no significant group differences between young and older controls. In cortical areas, PIB retention correlated inversely with cerebral glucose metabolism determined with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose.","background":"This report describes the first human study of a novel amyloid-imaging positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, termed Pittsburgh Compound-B (PIB), in 16 patients with diagnosed mild AD and 9 controls.","conclusion":"This relationship was most robust in the parietal cortex (r = -0.72; p = 0.0001). The results suggest that PET imaging with the novel tracer, PIB, can provide quantitative information on amyloid deposits in living subjects."},{"method":"Pathological changes not previously associated with the formation of new symptomatic lesions were observed in seven cases, namely, extensive oligodendrocyte apoptosis and microglial activation in myelinated tissue containing few or no lymphocytes or myelin phagocytes.","background":"The study describes the clinical and pathological findings in 12 patients with relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis, who died during or shortly after the onset of a relapse.","conclusion":"No current laboratory model of multiple sclerosis, in particular, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, is known with these features, which raises the possibility of some novel process underlying new lesion formation in multiple sclerosis."},{"method":"In this light, we performed a collaborative pooled analysis of individual-level data from all 11 published studies of the UCHL1 S18Y gene variant and PD. There were 1,970 cases and 2,224 unrelated controls.","background":"The reported inverse association between the S18Y variant of the ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) gene and Parkinson's disease (PD) has strong biological plausibility. If confirmed, genetic association of this variant with PD may support molecular targeting of the UCHL1 gene and its product as a therapeutic strategy for PD.","conclusion":"We found a statistically significant inverse association of S18Y with PD. Carriers of the variant allele (Y\/Y plus Y\/S vs S\/S) had an odds ratio (OR) of 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-0.95) and homozygotes for the variant allele (Y\/Y vs S\/S plus Y\/S) had an OR of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.57-0.88). There was a linear trend in the log OR consistent with a gene dose effect (p = 0.01). The inverse association was most apparent for young cases compared with young controls. There was no evidence for publication bias and the associations remained significant after excluding the first published, hypothesis-generating study. These findings confirm that UCHL1 is a susceptibility gene for PD and a potential target for disease-modifying therapies."},{"method":"To study the pathophysiology, we developed a simple experimental model reproducing the course. In rats, a thin sheet of expanding polymer was implanted microsurgically underneath the C5-C6 laminae. In the control group, the polymer sheet was removed immediately. Changes in motor functions were monitored for 25 weeks after the operation, with voluntary exercise activity measured by odometer attached to revolving cages, and forced running capability measured by duration of exercise on a rotating treadmill. Motor neurons were counted stereologically in continuous sections.","background":"Cervical myelopathy is a common cause of neurological disability among the elderly; however, the exact mechanism for the insidious and progressive deterioration remains to be elucidated.","conclusion":"In the compression group, the forced running capability deteriorated after a latent period of 17 weeks and progressively thereafter. In the control group, it stayed unchanged throughout 25 weeks. Course of the voluntary exercise was comparable between the groups. Motor neuron density in the compression group decreased significantly in 9 weeks (-20.3%) and 25 weeks (-35.5%), but not in 1 or 3 weeks. This practical model properly reproduces characteristic features of the clinical cervical myelopathy, with progressive motor disturbance after a latency and insidious neuronal loss preceding the symptoms."},{"method":"Immunostaining for tryptophan hydroxylase was performed on serial 50 microm sections of the medulla of brains obtained at autopsy from six control subjects, eight subjects with clinical diagnosis of MSA, and four with Parkinson's disease.","background":"We sought to determine whether medullary serotonergic neurons were affected in multiple system atrophy (MSA).","conclusion":"There was a severe depletion of serotonergic neurons in the nucleus raphe magnus, raphe obscurus, raphe pallidus, and ventrolateral medulla in MSA. Depletion of serotonergic neurons may contribute to impaired control of sympathetic outflow and other abnormalities in MSA."},{"method":"SCN2A was analyzed in 2 families with probable BFNIS, 9 with possible BFNIS, 10 with benign familial infantile seizures, and in 93 additional families with various early childhood epilepsies.","background":"We recently reported mutations in the sodium channel gene SCN2A in two families with benign familial neonatal-infantile seizures (BFNISs). Here, we aimed to refine the molecular-clinical correlation of SCN2A mutations in early childhood epilepsies.","conclusion":"Mutations effecting changes in conserved amino acids were found in two of two probable BFNIS families, in four of nine possible BFNIS families, and in none of the others. Our eight families had six different SCN2A mutations; one mutation (R1319Q) occurred in three families. BFNIS is an autosomal dominant disorder presenting between day 2 and 7 months (mean, 11.2 +\/- 9.2 weeks) with afebrile secondarily generalized partial seizures; neonatal seizures were not seen in all families. The frequency of seizures varied; some individuals had only a few attacks without treatment and others had clusters of many per day. Febrile seizures were rare. All cases remitted by 12 months. Ictal recordings in four subjects showed onset in the posterior quadrants. SCN2A mutations appear specific for BFNIS; the disorder can now be strongly suspected clinically and the families can be given an excellent prognosis."},{"method":"To test the proposal that corticostriatal connections are organized as multiple circuits in humans, we used diffusion tensor imaging axonal tracking, a new magnetic resonance technique that allows demonstration of fiber tracts in a noninvasive manner.","background":"A landmark of corticostriatal connectivity in nonhuman primates is that cortical connections are organized into a set of discrete circuits. Each circuit is assumed to perform distinct behavioral functions. In animals, most connectivity studies are performed using invasive tracing methods, which are nonapplicable in humans.","conclusion":"Diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber tracking showed that the posterior (sensorimotor), anterior (associative), and ventral (limbic) compartments of the human striatum have specific connections with the cortex, and particularly the frontal lobes. These results provide the first direct demonstration of distinct corticostriatal connections in humans."},{"method":"In the control subjects, cortical activation progressed in 30 to 80-millisecond steps from the occipital cortex to the superior temporal sulcus, to the inferior parietal lobe, and to the inferior frontal lobe, and finally, 75 to 90 milliseconds later, to the primary motor cortex of both hemispheres.","background":"Subjects with Asperger's syndrome (AS) are impaired in social interaction and imitation, but the underlying brain mechanisms are poorly understood. Because the mirror-neuron system (MNS) that matches observed and executed actions has been suggested to play an important role in imitation and in reading of other people's intentions, we assessed MNS functions in 8 adult AS subjects and in 10 healthy control subjects during imitation of still pictures of lip forms.","conclusion":"Similar activation sites were found in AS subjects but with slightly larger scatter. Activation of the inferior frontal lobe was delayed by 45 to 60 milliseconds and activations in the inferior frontal lobe and in the primary motor cortex were weaker than in control subjects. The observed abnormal premotor and motor processing could account for a part of imitation and social impairments in subjects with AS."},{"method":"We utilized a white matter parcellation technique that divides cerebral white matter into an outer zone containing the radiate compartment and an inner zone containing sagittal and bridging system compartments.","background":"Increased brain volume in autism appears to be driven mainly by an unexplained white matter enlargement, and we have reported a similar phenomenon in developmental language disorder (DLD). Localization of this enlargement would strongly guide research into its cause, tissue basis, and functional implications.","conclusion":"In both high-functioning autism and DLD, enlargement localized to the radiate white matter (all lobes in autism, all but parietal in DLD), whereas inner zone white matter compartments showed no volume differences from controls. Furthermore, in both autism and DLD, later or longer-myelinating regions showed greater volume increases over controls. Neither group showed cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, or internal capsule volume differences from control. Radiate white matter myelinates later than deep white matter; this pattern of enlargement thus is consistent with striking postnatal head circumference percentile increases reported in autism. These findings suggest an ongoing postnatal process in both autism and DLD that is probably intrinsic to white matter, that primarily affects intrahemispheric and corticocortical connections, and that places these two disorders on the same spectrum."},{"method":"To determine the role of glutamate excitotoxicity in fatal alphavirus-induced paralytic encephalomyelitis, we treated mice infected with neuroadapted Sindbis virus (NSV) with antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) subtypes of glutamate receptors.","background":"Neuronal damage during acute viral encephalomyelitis can result directly from virus infection or indirectly from the host immune response to infection. In neurodegenerative diseases and stroke, neuronal death also can result from excess release of excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters, such as glutamate.","conclusion":"Both apoptotic and necrotic neurons in the hippocampus were decreased in animals treated with MK-801, an NMDA receptor antagonist, or GYKI-52466, an AMPA receptor antagonist. However, only AMPA receptor blockade prevented damage to spinal cord motor neurons and protected mice from paralysis and death due to NSV infection. Protection was not caused by altered virus replication because treatment did not affect virus distribution and actually delayed virus clearance. These results provide evidence that NSV infection activates neurotoxic pathways that result in aberrant glutamate receptor stimulation and neuronal damage. Furthermore, AMPA receptor-mediated motor neuron death is an important contributor to paralysis and mortality in acute alphavirus-induced encephalomyelitis."},{"method":"Here, we examine the ability of a sodium channel-blocking agent, flecainide, to reduce axonal degeneration in an experimental model of MS, chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (CR-EAE). Rats with CR-EAE were treated with flecainide or vehicle from either 3 days before or 7 days after inoculation (dpi) until termination of the experiment at 28 to 30 dpi. Morphometric examination of neurofilament-labeled axons in the spinal cord of CR-EAE animals showed that both flecainide treatment regimens resulted in significantly higher numbers of axons surviving the disease (83 and 98% of normal) compared with controls (62% of normal).","background":"Axonal degeneration is a major cause of permanent neurological deficit in multiple sclerosis (MS), but no current therapies for the disease are known to be effective at axonal protection.","conclusion":"These findings indicate that flecainide and similar agents may provide a novel therapy aimed at axonal protection in MS and other neuroinflammatory disorders."},{"method":"Therefore, we examined in rats the effects of ligating and cutting one tibial nerve on sensory function and on density of innervation in hind paws contralaterally as well as ipsilaterally to the injury, at times between 1 day and 5 months after surgery. Punches removed from tibial- or sural-innervated planter paw skin were immunolabeled to quantitate epidermal nerve endings. Naive and sham-operated rats provided controls.","background":"There are no known anatomical connections between neurons that innervate homologous right and left body parts. Nevertheless, some patients develop bilateral abnormalities after unilateral injury, a phenomenon often unrecognized and not yet characterized.","conclusion":"Axotomized rats had near-total loss of PGP9.5(+) innervation within ipsilateral tibial-innervated skin at all time-points. Adjacent ipsilateral sural-innervated skin had persistent hyperalgesia without denervation, and robust axonal sprouting at 5 months after surgery. Contralesional hind paws lost 54% of innervation in tibial-innervated epidermis starting 1 week after surgery and persisting throughout. Contralesional sural-innervated skin had neither neurite loss nor sprouting. These results imply that unilateral nerve injury can cause profound, long lasting, nerve-branch-specific loss of distal innervation contralaterally as well as ipsilaterally. They discredit the practice of using tissues contralateral to an injury to provide normative controls and suggest the possibility of rapid, transmedian postinjury signals between homologous mirror-image neurons."},{"method":"We studied the expression of CCR7, a chemokine receptor required for migration of T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) to lymphoid organs, in the CNS of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) to gain insight into pathways for CNS immune cell trafficking.","background":"It is unclear how immune cells traffic between the lymphoid compartment and the central nervous system (CNS), which lacks lymphatic vessels and is shielded by the blood-brain barrier.","conclusion":"Inflamed MS lesions contained numerous CCR7+ myeloid cells expressing major histocompatibility complex class II, CD68 and CD86, consistent with maturing DCs. CCR7+ DCs also were identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These observations suggested that the afferent limb of CNS immunity is comprised, in part, of DCs, which are generated within the CNS and migrate to deep cervical lymph nodes through the CSF after antigen capture. Ninety percent of CSF T cells expressed CCR7 and CSF from patients with MS was relatively depleted of CCR7-negative effector-memory T cells. In contrast, all T cells in parenchymal MS lesions lacked CCR7, indicating local retention and differentiation of central-memory T cells upon restimulation by antigen within the CNS. These data suggested that the efferent limb of CNS immunity is executed by central-memory T cells, which enter CSF directly from the circulation."},{"method":"We studied 1,077 participants within the population-based Rotterdam Scan Study, who were 60 to 90 years of age and free of dementia.

Plasma suPAR levels were higher in HIV-1-infected patients than in controls and increased with HIV-1 disease stage regardless of the presence of CNS disease. In patients with ADC or CNS-OIs, CSF suPAR levels correlated with CSF HIV-1 RNA, but not with plasma suPAR concentrations. Highly active antiretroviral therapy was associated with a significant and parallel decrease of both CSF suPAR and HIV-1 RNA.","background":"The urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor (uPAR) play an important role in extracellular matrix degradation and cell migration in the central nervous system (CNS). To investigate the role of the uPA\/uPAR system in the pathophysiology of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome dementia complex (ADC), we measured soluble uPAR (suPAR) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected patients and controls.","conclusion":"In brain tissue from patients with HIV-1 encephalitis, uPAR was highly expressed by microglial and multinucleated giant cells staining positively for HIV-1. The overexpression of uPAR in the CNS of patients with ADC suggests that the uPA\/uPAR system may contribute to the tissue injury and neuronal damage in this disease."},{"method":"We found that the brain damage produced by direct injection of NMDA into the somatosensory cortex is attenuated by the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 or in COX-2-null mice, but that the associated production of free radicals is not. Furthermore, COX-2 inhibition reduces the lesions even if the deleterious effects of free radicals are eliminated by the scavenger superoxide dismutase.","background":"The prostaglandin synthesizing enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has emerged as a critical pathogenic factor in brain diseases associated with activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, including stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the COX-2 reaction products responsible for these deleterious effects have not been identified. In particular, the relative contribution to the neurotoxicity of COX-2-derived prostanoids and reactive oxygen species has not been defined.","conclusion":"The protection exerted by NS-398 is counteracted by a stable analog of prostaglandin E2. The findings directly implicate COX-2-derived prostanoids, rather then radicals, in the COX-2-dependent component of the damage mediated by NMDA receptors and strengthen the rationale for using COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of neurological diseases associated with glutamate neurotoxicity."},{"method":"To investigate its cellular origin, we treated rats daily with vigabatrin for 45 days. Two days after arresting this treatment, rats exhibited an irreversible decrease in the photopic electroretinogram, the flicker response, and the oscillatory potentials.","background":"Epileptic patients experienced an irreversible loss of their peripheral visual field upon treatment with vigabatrin (gamma-vinyl GABA), an inhibitor of the GABA degrading enzyme, GABA transaminase. Subsequently, central visual function was reported to also be irreversibly altered. This visual loss is associated with a decrease in the electroretinogram measurement localizing the deficit to the retina.","conclusion":"These functional alterations were associated with a peripheral disorganization of the outer retina. However, photoreceptor damage was not limited to these disorganized areas, but cone inner and outer segments were severely injured in more central areas and their numbers were irreversibly decreased by 17 to 20%. Ultrastructural examination of the retina confirmed the presence of major photoreceptor damages, which were further supported by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and caspase-3 activation both indicative of photoreceptor apoptosis. This study suggests that the visual field loss in vigabatrin-treated epileptic patients may result from a sequence of events starting from cone cell injury to a more severe disorganization of the photoreceptor layer."},{"method":"Striatal mean binding potential was decreased by 62 to 77% in the DLB\/PD group and 45 to 67% in the DLB\/AD compared to AD and control. Binding was lower in the DLB\/PD group than the DLB\/AD, but the differences reached only marginal significance in the caudate nucleus. No differences were found between AD and control groups though a few AD patients had binding values below the range of the controls. Subsequent neuropathological examination in one AD patient revealed both AD and DLB changes despite the absence of clinical parkinsonism.","background":"We used positron emission tomography (PET) with (+)-[(11)C]dihydrotetrabenazine ([+]-[(11)C]DTBZ) to examine striatal monoaminergic presynaptic terminal density in 20 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 25 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 19 normal elderly controls. Six DLB patients developed parkinsonism at least 1 year before dementia (DLB\/PD) and 14 developed dementia before parkinsonism or at about the same time (DLB\/AD).","conclusion":"Both DLB groups had an anterior to posterior binding deficit gradient relative to controls, largest in posterior putamen, smaller in anterior putamen, smallest in caudate nucleus. The DLB\/AD group showed significant binding asymmetry only in posterior putamen. We conclude that PET with (+)-[(11)C]DTBZ differentiates DLB from AD, and decreased binding in AD may indicate subclinical DLB pathology in addition to AD pathology."},{"method":"We have examined the effects of methylphenidate (MPD), an inhibitor of DAT, administered alone or with levodopa, on parkinsonism measured with tapping and walking speeds, dyskinesia, subjective effects, and vital signs. MPD in oral doses of up to 0.4 mg\/kg was well tolerated. Administered alone, MPD produced no objective improvement of parkinsonism. MPD, 0.4 mg\/kg orally, coadministered with 2-hour levodopa infusions at 0.5 or 1.0mg\/kg\/hr increased the percentage of patients responding to the 0.5mg\/kg\/hr dose and prolonged the response to levodopa infusions as measured by tapping and walking speeds.","background":"The dopamine transporter (DAT) may be the single most important determinant of extracellular dopamine concentrations. The importance of DAT in Parkinson's disease (PD) in which DAT may be reduced by 50 to 70% is unclear.","conclusion":"Dyskinesia was prolonged in proportion to the increase in antiparkinson actions but severity was not increased. MPD decreased the hypotensive response to levodopa. In conclusion, MPD appeared to have no effect given alone but potentiated the effects of levodopa, particularly doses at threshold for clinical effects. These observations indicate that the residual DAT is functional in PD and is a potential target for symptomatic therapy of PD."},{"method":"Numerous angiomesenchymal tumorlets, which resembled hemangioblastoma, but which also consistently showed distinct histological features, were distributed in the nerve roots, spinal cord, and cerebellum. Genetic analysis consistently showed deletion of the wild-type VHL allele in these tumorlets.","background":"The histogenetic origin and the basis of the distribution of central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene syndrome, VHL disease, are unknown. To better understand hemangioblastoma histogenesis, we analyzed postmortem CNS tissues from four patients with well-established diagnosis of VHL disease including development of characteristic tumors and positive family history.","conclusion":"Most angiomesenchymal tumorlets were in the dorsal nerve roots; the anterior roots and cerebellum were less frequently affected. Tumorlet distribution was highly consistent in the four cases. In analogy to the wide morphological spectrum of lesions known to exist in VHL kidneys, nerve roots appear to harbor more wide-spread and morphologically heterogeneous changes than previously appreciated. The abundance of tumorlets, associated with highly consistent morphology and topography, suggests a developmental origin of hemangioblastoma. Therefore, in VHL disease, inactivation of the VHL wild-type allele appears necessary, but not sufficient, for the formation of tumor that produces symptoms and neurological disability."},{"method":"Here, we used a highly efficient multilocus genotyping assay to study single nucleotide polymorphisms representing variation in 34 genes from inflammatory pathways in a well-characterized MS familial data set.","background":"A large body of research supports a multifactorial cause in multiple sclerosis (MS), with an underlying genetic susceptibility likely acting in concert with undefined environmental exposures.","conclusion":"Evidence of transmission distortion was present for several polymorphisms. Results for the NOS2A locus (exon 10 C\/T, D346D) on chromosome 17q11 remained significant after correction for multiple testing and were reproduced in a second independent African American MS data set. In addition, linkage to a NOS2A promoter region polymorphism, (CCTTT)(n), was present in a third data set of multicase MS families. Our results provide strong evidence for linkage and association to a new candidate disease gene on chromosome 17q11 in MS and suggest that variation within NOS2A or a nearby locus contributes to disease susceptibility."},{"method":"Therefore, these experiments were designed to study scrapie pathogenesis in vivo in the absence of neuronal PrP expression. Hamster scrapie (strain 263K) was used to infect transgenic mice expressing hamster PrP in the brain only in astrocytes. These mice previously were shown to develop clinical scrapie, but it was unclear whether the brain pathology was caused by damage to astrocytes, neurons, or other cell types. In this electron microscopic study, neurons demonstrated TSE-specific pathology despite lacking PrP expression.","background":"In the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), accumulation of the abnormal disease-specific prion protein is associated with neurodegeneration. Previous data suggested that abnormal prion protein (PrP) could induce neuronal pathology only when neurons expressed the normal form of PrP, but conflicting evidence also has been reported. Understanding whether neuronal PrP expression is required for TSE neuropathological damage in vivo is essential for determining the mechanism of TSE pathogenesis.","conclusion":"Abnormal PrP was identified around astrocytes, primarily in the extracellular spaces of the neuropil, but astrocytes showed only reactive changes and no damage. Therefore, in this model the pathogenesis of the disease appeared to involve neuronal damage associated with extracellular astrocytic accumulation of abnormal PrP acting upon nearby PrP-negative neurons or triggering the release of non-PrP neurotoxic factors from astrocytes."},{"method":"A negative linear relationship between task-related brain activation, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging, and outcome is seen in several identical primary and nonprimary motor regions that is independent of time after stroke.","background":"After stroke, the pattern of brain activation during performance of a motor task is related to outcome. Here, we compare this relationship in the early (10-14 days) and late (at least 3 months) phases after first-ever stroke.","conclusion":"In other words, patients with poorer outcome scores recruit more widely within motor-related regions in both the early or late poststroke phase. However, in contralesional middle intraparietal sulcus, contralesional cerebellum, and ipsilesional rostral premotor cortex, this relationship is seen only in the early poststroke phase. Thus, patients with poorer outcome scores recruit these areas in only the early and not the late poststroke phase. These results suggest that there are differences in the cerebral implementation of action in patients with poor outcome that are dependent on the time since stroke. Thus, in those patients with the most to gain from rehabilitation, different therapeutic approaches may be required at different stages after stroke."},{"method":"This question was addressed with thioflavin-S histofluorescence to identify neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and two tau antibodies (AT8, Alz-50) to identify pre-tangle cytopathology in the nucleus basalis, the source of cortical cholinergic innervation. Methods for the concurrent visualization of tauopathy and choline acetyltransferase were used to determine if the cytopathology was selectively located within cholinergic neurons. Five elderly index cases who had died at the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early AD were identified by longitudinal neuropsychological and behavioral assessments. They were compared to 7 age-matched cognitively normal subjects.","background":"The cholinergic denervation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) provides the rationale for treatments with anticholinesterases. The presence of this cholinergic lesion is solidly established in advanced AD. Whether it also exists in early disease remains unsettled.","conclusion":"NFT and AT8 (or Alz-50) immunostaining in cholinergic nucleus basalis neurons existed even in the cognitively normal subjects. The percentage of tauopathy-containing nucleus basalis neurons was greater in the cognitively impaired and showed a significant correlation with memory scores obtained 1-18 months prior to death. These results show that cytopathology in cortical cholinergic pathways is a very early event in the course of the continuum that leads from advanced age to MCI and AD."},{"method":"Here, we report that mice overexpressing APP (K670N:M671L) together with PS1 (M146L) have abnormal LTP as early as 3 months of age.","background":"Increasing evidence points to synaptic plasticity impairment as one of the first events in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, studies on synaptic dysfunction in different transgenic AD models that overexpress familial AD mutant forms of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and\/or presenilin (PS) have provided conflicting results. Both long-term potentiation (LTP) and basal synaptic transmission (BST) have been found to be both unchanged and altered in different models and under differing experimental conditions. Because of their more robust amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition, double transgenic mice currently are used by several laboratories as an AD model.","conclusion":"Interestingly, reduced LTP paralleled plaque appearance and increased Abeta levels and abnormal short-term memory (working memory). BST and long-term memory (reference memory) are impaired only later (approximately 6 months) as amyloid burden increases. Abeta pathology across different ages did not correlate with synaptic and cognitive deficits, suggesting that Abeta levels are not a marker of memory decline. In contrast, progression of LTP impairment correlated with the deterioration of working memory, suggesting that percentage of potentiation might be an indicator of the cognitive decline and disease progression in the APP\/PS1 mice."},{"method":"Eight (38%) had silent infarction in the parietooccipital cortex, deep white matter, or basal ganglia, including two of three with previous seizures. Of 17 undergoing TCD, none had maximum middle cerebral artery (MCA) velocities greater than 126cm\/sec, but 9 were abnormal, with low velocities and difficulty in tracking the MCA and\/or asymmetry. Three patients had abnormal MRA, one of whom also had silent infarction. One patient had pathological VEP recordings, whereas all SEP recordings were normal. WISC-III was performed in all 11 children, 4 with silent infarction: all but 1 had IQ scores greater than 85 (mean, 97.7; standard deviation, 14.2).","background":"Twenty-one children and young adults with sickle\/beta-thalassemia without overt stroke were examined with magnetic resonance imaging and angiography (MRA), transcranial Doppler (TCD), visual (VEP) and median nerve somatosensory (SEP)-evoked potential recordings, and neuropsychological testing (Wechsler Intelligence Scale [WISC-III]).","conclusion":"We conclude that Greek children and young adults with Sbeta-thalassemia and no history of clinical stroke have TCD abnormalities and silent infarction similar to those reported in children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia, but cognitive function is not necessarily compromised.

In contrast, resections in the language nondominant hemisphere increased the same cellular elements. T-cell responses to mitogens and microbial antigens were not differentially affected. Left\/right arm histamine skin response ratios were altered in patients with left cerebral epileptic focus, and flare skin responses were reduced by left cerebral resections in contrast with an increase after right cerebral resections.","background":"Cerebral lateralization may be important in neural control of immune function. Animal studies have demonstrated differential effects of left and right brain lesions on immune function, but human studies are inconclusive.","conclusion":"The findings demonstrate a differential role of the left and right cerebral hemispheres on immune functions in humans."},{"method":"We devised a simple functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm aimed at exploring this hypothesis in healthy humans.","background":"Electrophysiological data in primates suggest that the superior parietal lobule integrates the position of the limbs to construct complex representations of postures.

The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of functional brain changes in this same population using functional magnetic resonance imaging.","conclusion":"In the setting of normal cognitive performance, presymptomatic HD subjects had significantly and specifically less activation in the left anterior cingulate cortex (BA 24, 32) compared with matched controls."},{"method":"A blinded comparison was performed between the extent of parenchymal hemorrhage and initial clinical variables as well as outcomes measured at 6 to 12 months after injury.","background":"An inception cohort of 40 children and adolescents with traumatic brain injury and suspected diffuse axonal injury were studied using a new high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging susceptibility-weighted technique that is very sensitive for hemorrhage.","conclusion":"Children with lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores (&lt; or =8, n = 30) or prolonged coma (&gt;4 days, n = 20) had a greater average number (p = 0.007) and volume (p = 0.008) of hemorrhagic lesions. Children with normal outcomes or mild disability (n = 30) at 6 to 12 months had, on average, fewer hemorrhagic lesions (p = 0.003) and lower volume (p = 0.003) of lesions than those who were moderately or severely disabled or in a vegetative state. Significant differences also were observed when comparing regional injury to clinical variables. Because susceptibility-weighted imaging is much more sensitive than conventional T2*-weighted gradient-echo sequences in detecting hemorrhagic diffuse axonal injury, more accurate and objective assessment of injury can be obtained early after insult, and may provide better prognostic information regarding duration of coma as well as long-term outcome."},{"method":"We examined the relationship between neuronal activity during the latent period after trauma and subsequent expression of hyperexcitability by varying the timing of TTX treatment. Partially isolated islands of rat sensorimotor cortex were treated with Elvax polymer containing TTX to suppress cortical activity and slices obtained for in vitro experiments 10 to 15 days later. TTX treatment was either started immediately after injury and discontinued after a variable number of days or delayed for a variable time after the lesion was placed.","background":"Penetrating cortical trauma frequently results in delayed development of epilepsy. In the rat undercut model of neocortical posttraumatic hyperexcitability, suppression of neuronal activity by exposing the injured cortex to tetrodotoxin (TTX) in vivo for approximately 2 weeks prevents the expression of abnormal hypersynchronous discharges in neocortical slices.","conclusion":"Immediate treatment lasting only 2 to 3 days and treatment delayed up to 3 days prevented hyperexcitability. Thus, there is a critical period for development of hyperexcitability in this model that depends on cortical activity. We propose that the hyperexcitability caused by partial cortical isolation may represent an early stage of posttraumatic epileptogenesis. A hypothetical cascade of events leading to subsequent pathophysiological activity is likely initiated at the time of injury but remains plastic during this critical period."},{"method":"Forty healthy humans took 100mg of the dopamine precursor levodopa or placebo daily for 5 days in a randomized double-blind and parallel-group design. Ninety minutes later on each day, subjects were trained on an artificial vocabulary using a high-frequency repetitive approach.","background":"Dopamine is a potent modulator of learning and has been implicated in the encoding of stimulus salience. Repetition, however, as required for the acquisition and reacquisition of sensorimotor or cognitive skills (e.g., in aphasia therapy), decreases salience. We here tested whether increasing brain levels of dopamine during repetitive training improves learning success.","conclusion":"Levodopa significantly enhanced the speed, overall success, and long-term retention of novel word learning in a dose-dependent manner. These findings indicate new ways to potentiate learning in a variety of domains if conventional training alone fails."},{"method":"To evaluate the role of HTLV-II in neurological disease, we have critically reviewed all reported cases of HTLV-II-associated disorders.","background":"Human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) and type II (HTLV-II) are closely related retroviruses with similar biological properties and common modes of transmission. HTLV-I infection is endemic in well-defined geographic regions, and it is estimated that some 20 million individuals are infected worldwide. Although most infected individuals are asymptomatic carriers, some 2 to 5% will develop a chronic encephalomyelopathy, HTLV-I-associated myelopathy\/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM\/TSP). In contrast with HTLV-I, the role of HTLV-II in the development of neurological disorders is much less clear. HTLV-II is endemic in many native Amerindian groups and epidemic in injecting drug users (IDUs) worldwide.","conclusion":"This has confirmed that although rare infection is associated with a disorder clinically similar or identical to HAM\/TSP. However, most reports that have attributed infection to a range of other neurological disorders are difficult to evaluate in that in many cases either the association appears to be fortuitous or the presentations were confounded by a background of concomitant human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection and\/or active IDU. In view of the many HTLV-II-infected individuals in urban areas of North America and Europe, neurologists should be aware of the potential clinical consequences of this infection."},{"method":"Here, we describe the results of a large-scale biochemical study of PrP(Sc) from autopsy-proved cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (n = 59) and compare these with cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (n = 170) in the United Kingdom over the period 1991 to 2002.","background":"Human prion diseases can occur as an idiopathic disorder (sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) or can be acquired, as is the case for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. These disorders are characterized by the accumulation of a protease-resistant form of the host-encoded prion protein termed PrP(Sc) in the brains of affected individuals. PrP(Sc) has been proposed to be the principal, if not sole, component of the infectious agent, with its accumulation in the central nervous system the primary event leading to neurodegeneration. A major question remains as to whether self-propagating structural differences in PrP(Sc) might account for the clinicopathological diversity evident in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and whether different prion protein types underlie the existence of different strains of causative agent.","conclusion":"The results show PrP(Sc) in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease to be remarkably stereotyped. In contrast, considerable heterogeneity in PrP(Sc) exists both between and within cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."},{"method":"We also show that transgenic mice with increased expression of human HADH II\/ABAD are significantly more resistant to MPTP than their wild-type littermates.

Interestingly, these uptake changes continued for at least 8 days and the magnitude of the lasting effects in the limbic-related areas was negatively correlated across subjects with those in the motor\/premotor cortices.

T1 maps were acquired repeatedly before and up to 1.5 hours after the intravenous injection of either Gd-DTPA or Gd-DTPA-sLe(x) A. Analysis of images included a pixel-by-pixel subtraction of T1 maps from the precontrast T1 maps and quantification of T1 within the ischemic area.","background":"Focal ischemia followed by reperfusion initiates a harmful P- and E-selectin-mediated recruitment of leukocytes in brain microvasculature.","conclusion":"After injection of Gd-DTPA-sLe(x) A, T1 decreased compared with precontrast levels, and an interhemispheric difference between the pre-post contrast T1 developed within the stroke lesion at a mean time of 52 minutes after injection (p &lt; 0.05). Animals injected with Gd-DTPA did not exhibit changes in T1 signal intensity between regions of the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, indicating that the reductions in T1 observed with Gd-DTPA-sLe(x) A were unrelated to blood-brain barrier breakdown. Fluorescent-labeled sLe(x) A administered intravenously was observed to bind to the endothelium of injured but not control brain. The study suggests that the contrast agent Gd-DTPA-sLe(x) A can be used to visualize early endothelial activation after transient focal ischemia in vivo with MRI."},{"method":"Subjects performed a visual encoding task during fMRI scanning and were tested for recognition of stimuli afterward. MTL regions of interest were identified from each individual's structural MRI, and activation was quantified within each region.","background":"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to study memory-associated activation of medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions in 32 nondemented elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).","conclusion":"Greater extent of activation within the hippocampal formation and parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) was correlated with better memory performance. There was, however, a paradoxical relationship between extent of activation and clinical status at both baseline and follow-up evaluations. Subjects with greater clinical impairment, based on the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes, recruited a larger extent of the right PHG during encoding, even after accounting for atrophy. Moreover, those who subsequently declined over the 2.5 years of clinical follow-up (44% of the subjects) activated a significantly greater extent of the right PHG during encoding, despite equivalent memory performance. We hypothesize that increased activation in MTL regions reflects a compensatory response to accumulating AD pathology and may serve as a marker for impending clinical decline."},{"method":"We have identified a novel H1736L missense mutation in the CACNA1A gene associated with the EA2 phenotype. This mutation is localized near the pore-forming region of the P\/Q-type Ca2+ channel. Functional analysis of P\/Q-type channels containing the mutation show that the H1736L alteration affects several channel properties, including reduced current density, increased rate of inactivation, and a shift in the voltage dependence of activation to more positive values.","background":"Episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by paroxysmal attacks of ataxia, vertigo, and nausea, typically lasting minutes to days in duration. These symptoms can be prevented or significantly attenuated by the oral administration of acetazolamide; however, the mechanism by which acetazolamide ameliorates EA2 symptoms is unknown. EA2 typically results from nonsense mutations in the CACNA1A gene that encodes the alpha1A (Cav2.1) subunit of the P\/Q-type calcium (Ca2+) channel.","conclusion":"Although these findings are consistent with an overall loss of P\/Q-type channel function, the mutation also caused some biophysical changes consistent with a gain of function. We also tested the direct effect of acetazolamide on both wild-type and H1736L mutated P\/Q-type channels and did not observe any direct action on channel properties of this pharmacological agent used to treat EA2 patients."},{"method":"To test this hypothesis, we had 13 chronic stroke patients perform motor tasks with the paretic hand and arm during cutaneous anesthesia of the healthy hand and healthy foot in separate sessions.","background":"In healthy volunteers, reduction of somatosensory input from one hand leads to rapid performance improvements in the other hand. Thus, it is possible that reduction of somatosensory input from the healthy hand can influence motor function in the paretic hand of chronic stroke patients with unilateral hand weakness.","conclusion":"Performance of a finger tapping task, but not a wrist flexion task, improved significantly with anesthesia of the hand, but not the foot. This effect progressed with the duration of anesthesia and correlated with baseline motor function. We conclude that cutaneous anesthesia of the healthy hand elicits transient site-specific improvements in motor performance of the moderately paretic hand in patients with chronic stroke, consistent with interhemispheric competition models of sensorimotor processing."},{"method":"Brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) showed hydrocephalus, bilateral frontal polymicrogyria, abnormal cerebellum, and characteristic flattened dystrophic pons.

Using lesion models of CNS injury, we found that intraperitoneal treatment of adult rats with folic acid significantly improves the regrowth of sensory spinal axons into a grafted segment of peripheral nerve in vivo.","background":"Folic acid supplementation has proved to be extremely effective in reducing the occurrence of neural tube defects (NTDs) and other congenital abnormalities in humans, suggesting that folic acid can modulate key mechanisms for growth and differentiation in the central nervous system (CNS). To prevent NTDs, however, supplemental folate must be provided early in gestation. This suggests that the ability of folic acid to activate growth and differentiation mechanisms may be confined to the early embryonic period.","conclusion":"Regrowth of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons into a similar graft also was enhanced, although to a smaller extent than spinal axons. Furthermore, folic acid supplementation enhances neurological recovery from a spinal cord contusion injury, showing its potential clinical impact. The results show that the effects of folic acid supplementation on CNS growth processes are not restricted to the embryonic period, but can also be effective for enhancing growth, repair, and recovery in the injured adult CNS."},{"method":"Using a unique animal model of severe complex I deficiency induced by ribozymes targeted against a critical complex I subunit gene (NDUFA1), we attempted rescue of the optic nerve degeneration associated with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.

They include Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, Leigh syndrome, and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes. There is no effective treatment for these or any other mitochondrial disorder.","conclusion":"Relative to mock infection, SOD2 reduced apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells and degeneration of optic nerve fibers, the hallmarks of this disease. Rescue of this animal model supports a critical role for oxidative injury in disorders with complex I deficiency and shows that a respiratory deficit may be effectively treated in mammals, thus offering hope to patients."},{"method":"Nineteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 17q21 region were genotyped in two case-control samples. The SNPs that were associated with higher risk for the disease in the homozygous state delimit a region of more that 1 Mb.

The objective of this study was to determine the size of the H1E haplotype associated with PSP and CBD in different populations and to identify specific subhaplotypes in the background of H1E haplotype.","conclusion":"A specific subhaplotype (H1E'A) was present in 16% of PSP patients but was not observed in the controls. Furthermore, the H2E'A haplotype, was rarely present in the disease group suggesting that it plays a protective role. The identification of these specific subhaplotypes that modify risk for PSP\/CBD supports the hypothesis that a pathogenic allele exists in a subgroup of PSP patients."},{"method":"Stimulation at 40 and 130 Hz improved chorea.

When neurons were exposed to cisplatin (5-100 microM), cyclophosphamide (5-100 microM), methotrexate (5-100 microM), vinblastin (0.1-1 microM), or thiotepa (5-100 microM), a concentration-dependent neurotoxic effect was observed. Neurotoxicity was potentiated by nontoxic glutamate concentrations. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist MK 801 (10 microM), the AMPA receptor antagonists GYKI 52466 (10 microM) and NBQX (10 microM), and the pancaspase inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (1 nM) ameliorated neurotoxicity of cytotoxic drugs. To investigate neurotoxicity in vivo, we administered to 7-day-old rats the following: cisplatin (5-15 mg\/kg i.p.), cyclophosphamide (200-600 mg\/kg i.p.), thiotepa (15-45 mg\/kg), or ifosfamide (100-500 mg\/kg) and their brains were analyzed at 4 to 24 hours.","background":"Neurotoxicity of anticancer agents complicates treatment of children with cancer.","conclusion":"Cytotoxic drugs produced widespread lesions within cortex, thalamus, hippocampal dentate gyrus, and caudate nucleus in a dose-dependent fashion. Early histological analysis demonstrated dendritic swelling and relative preservation of axonal terminals, which are morphological features indicating excitotoxicity. After longer survival periods, degenerating neurons displayed morphological features consistent with active cell death. These results demonstrate that anticancer drugs are potent neurotoxins in vitro and in vivo; they activate excitotoxic mechanisms but also trigger active neuronal death."},{"method":"Here, we systemically injected six doses of naturally occurring (epoxomicin) or synthetic (Z-lle-Glu(OtBu)-Ala-Leu-al [PSI]) proteasome inhibitors into adult rats over a period of 2 weeks. After a latency of 1 to 2 weeks, animals developed progressive parkinsonism with bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and an abnormal posture, which improved with apomorphine treatment. Positron emission tomography demonstrated reduced carbon-11-labeled 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane (CFT) binding to dopaminergic nerve terminals in the striatum, indicative of degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway. Postmortem analyses showed striatal dopamine depletion and dopaminergic cell death with apoptosis and inflammation in the substantia nigra pars compacta. In addition, neurodegeneration occurred in the locus coeruleus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and the nucleus basalis of Meynert. At neurodegenerative sites, intracytoplasmic, eosinophilic, alpha-synuclein\/ubiquitin-containing, inclusions resembling Lewy bodies were present in some of the remaining neurons.","background":"Environmental toxins have been implicated in the etiology of Parkinson's disease. Recent findings of defects in the ubiquitin-proteasome system in hereditary and sporadic forms of the illness suggest that environmental proteasome inhibitors are candidate PD-inducing toxins.","conclusion":"This animal model induced by proteasome inhibitors closely recapitulates key features of PD and may be valuable in studying etiopathogenic mechanisms and putative neuroprotective therapies for the illness."},{"method":"Enzyme screening and sequencing of the coding regions of other NCL genes was negative.","background":"We describe the ninth variant of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) or Batten disease, due to defects in a putative new gene, CLN9. We therefore refer to the new variant as CLN9-deficient. Two Serbian sisters and two German brothers are described. Their clinical history is characteristic for juvenile NCL. They show similar gene expression patterns. The existence of this variant is supported by the presence of curvilinear inclusions, fingerprint profiles, and granular osmiophilic deposits in neurons, lymphocytes, and conjunctival cells.","conclusion":"CLN9-deficient cells have a distinctive phenotype. They have rounded cell bodies, have prominent nucleoli, attach poorly to the culture dish, and are sensitive to apoptosis but have increased growth rates. Gene expression of proteins involved in cell adhesion and apoptosis is altered in these cells. Sphingolipid metabolism is also perturbed. They have decreased levels of ceramide, sphingomyelin, lactosylceramide, ceramide trihexoside, and globoside and increased activity of serine palmitoyl transferase."},{"method":"Therefore, blood oxygenation level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) was performed in 36 subjects (18 HIV and 18 seronegative [SN] controls) during a set of visual attention tasks with increasing levels of attentional load.","background":"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients commonly have attention and concentration problems. However, it remains unclear how HIV infection affects the attention network.","conclusion":"Compared with SN controls, HIV subjects showed similar task performance (accuracies and reaction times) but decreased activation in the normal visual attention network (dorsal parietal, bilateral prefrontal, and cerebellar regions) and increased activation in adjacent or contralateral brain regions. Cognitive performance (assessed with NPZ-8), CD4, and viral load all correlated with activated BOLD signals in brain regions that activated more in HIV subjects. Furthermore, HIV subjects activated more than SN controls in brain regions that showed load-dependent increase in activation (right prefrontal and right parietal regions) but less in regions that showed a saturation effect with increasing load. These findings suggest that HIV-associated brain injury leads to reduced efficiency in the normal attention network, thus requiring reorganization and increased usage of neural reserves to maintain performance during attention-requiring tasks. Exceeding the brain reserve capacity may lead to attention deficits and cognitive impairment in HIV patients."},{"method":"Two American isolates of species B. burgdorferi sensu stricto were compared with three European isolates, two of species B. garinii, and one of species B. afzelii.","background":"Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the causative organism of Lyme borreliosis, is a heterogeneous group of spirochetes, consisting of at least three pathogenic species. To test the hypothesis that the genetic heterogeneity is the reason for the clinical differences, we investigated whether the experimental disease induced by European isolates is different from that induced by American isolates.","conclusion":"The patterns of infection, immunity, and inflammation induced by the different species was distinctive. Inflammatory cells and levels of antibody in B. garinii- and B. afzelii-infected animals were lower than in B. burgdorferi s.s.-infected animals, whereas levels of spirochetal infection in the skin and nervous system were higher in the former group of animals. These data demonstrate that B. burgdorferi s.s. strains are more infective and inflammatory, whereas B. garinii and B. afzelii strains can survive the adaptive immune response to a greater degree and persist at greater numbers in the skin and nervous system. The results explain to a large extent the disparities between LNB in humans in the United States and Europe."},{"method":"This study evaluated whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drug penetration and CSF virological suppression influence the extent of neuropsychological (NP) improvement during ART. Overall performance on a battery of NP tests administered at baseline and follow-up (median 15 weeks) was computed by using the global deficit score (GDS) methods in 31 cognitively impaired, HIV-infected individuals who began new ART regimens.

Subjects attaining CSF virological suppression demonstrated greater GDS improvement than those who did not (median GDS change, 0.62 vs 0.23; p = 0.01). A similar trend for plasma did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.053). NP improvement was greater in ART-naive versus treatment-experienced subjects. In a multivariate model (overall p = 0.0008), significant, independent predictors of GDS reduction were CSF HIV RNA suppression, baseline antiretroviral history, and their interaction. Including CSF-penetrating drugs in the ART regimen and monitoring CSF viral load may be indicated for individuals with HIV-associated cognitive impairment."},{"method":"Using antichorein antisera, we found expression of chorein in all human cells analyzed.

It is caused by mutations in VPS13A, which encodes a large protein called chorein.","conclusion":"This suggests that loss of chorein expression is a diagnostic feature of ChAc."},{"method":"To evaluate S6K as a candidate meningioma progression gene, we generated IOMM-Lee human meningioma cell lines overexpressing S6K.","background":"One common genetic change in anaplastic meningiomas is amplification of chromosome 17q23 containing the S6 kinase (S6K) gene. We show, for the first time to our knowledge, increased S6K mRNA expression in anaplastic meningiomas compared with benign tumors.","conclusion":"Whereas no effect of S6K overexpression on meningioma cell growth, motility, or adhesion was observed in vitro, S6K overexpression resulted in increased tumor size in vivo. Collectively, these results suggest that S6K is functionally important for meningioma progression and may represent a target for future meningioma therapy."},{"method":"This study reexamines the relationships between clinical and pathological subtypes of FTD in a large series from two centers (n = 61). Clinical subtypes defined were behavioral variant FTD (n = 26), language variants (semantic dementia, n = 9; and progressive nonfluent aphasia, n = 8), and motor variants (corticobasal degeneration, n = 9; and motor neuron disease, n = 9), although most cases presented with a combination of behavioral and language problems. Unexpectedly, some behavioral cases (n = 5) had marked amnesia at presentation. The pathological subtypes were those with tau-immunopositive inclusions (with Pick bodies, n = 20; or without, n = 11), those with ubiquitin immunopositive inclusions (n = 16), and those lacking distinctive histology (n = 14).","background":"The term frontotemporal dementia (FTD) encompasses a range of clinical syndromes that are believed not to map reliably onto the spectrum of recognized pathologies.","conclusion":"Behavioral symptoms and semantic dementia were associated with a range of pathologies. In contrast, other clinical phenotypes had relatively uniform underlying pathologies: motor neuron disease predicted ubiquitinated inclusions, parkinsonism and apraxia predicted corticobasal pathology, and nonfluent aphasia predicted Pick bodies. Therefore, the pathological substrate can be predicted in a significant proportion of FTD patients, which has important implications for studies targeting mechanistic treatments."},{"method":"In this study, we found inhibition of UPS function in both early (0-1, with no or little neuronal loss) and late (3-4, with more severe neuronal loss) stage HD patients' cerebellum, cortex, substantia nigra and caudate-putamen brain regions. Late HD stage increases in ubiquitin levels were unique to caudate-putamen. HD patients' skin fibroblasts also had UPS inhibition similar to brain despite increases in proteasome beta-subunit expression. Gene delivery and expression of proteasome activator PA28 increased UPS function in normal but not HD fibroblasts.","background":"Mutated intracellular huntingtin is widely expressed in tissues of Huntington's disease (HD) patients. Intraneuronal nuclear protein aggregates of mutant huntingtin are present in HD brains, suggesting a dysfunction of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Because many cells and tissues can cope with the abnormal gene effects while others dysfunction and die, we determined gene-induced effects and considered the hypothesis that the gene causes multiple intracellular problems, but severe pathology is seen only in selected brain regions.","conclusion":"These generalized UPS problems are associated with severe neuronal pathology only when coupled with decreases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, mitochondrial complex II\/III activity, and increases of ubiquitin levels particularly as seen in the caudate-putamen of HD patients."},{"method":"We performed a genomewide linkage analysis in a large French family with four members affected with narcolepsy-cataplexy and 10 others with isolated recurrent naps or lapses into sleep.

Tuberin mRNA levels were reduced in GCs from TSC patients with TSC2 gene mutations but were unchanged in BCs. Phospho-S6K, -S6, -STAT3, and -4EBP1 expression in GCs reflects loss of hamartin-tuberin-mediated mTOR pathway inhibition. Phospho-S6 expression alone in BCs does not support mTOR cascade activation in FCD.

A 73-year-old woman reported a total dream loss after acute, bilateral occipital artery infarction (including the right inferior lingual gyrus), which lasted for over 3 months. In the absence of sleep-wake complaints and (other) neuropsychological deficits, polysomnography demonstrated an essentially normal sleep architecture with preservation of REM sleep. Dreaming was denied also after repeated awakenings from REM sleep.","background":"The term Charcot-Wilbrand syndrome (CWS) denotes dream loss following focal brain damage.","conclusion":"This observation suggests that CWS (1) can represent a distinct and isolated neuropsychological manifestation of deep occipital lobe damage, and (2) may occur in the absence of detectable REM sleep abnormalities."},{"method":"Here, we describe a novel homozygous mutation (1573_1574 insTTAG) identified in an AREP patient, which causes a frameshift and truncation at the C-terminus of the PINK1 protein, outside the kinase catalytic domain.","background":"Two homozygous mutations in the PINK1 gene, encoding a mitochondrial putative protein kinase, recently have been identified in families with PARK6-linked, autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism (AREP).","conclusion":"The clinical phenotype includes early-onset (28 years) parkinsonism, foot dystonia at onset, good levodopa response, slow progression, early levodopa-induced dyskinesias, and sleep benefit, thereby resembling closely parkin-related disease.

Cholinergic hypofunction contributes to dementia-related cognitive decline and remains a target of therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer's disease. In light of this, partial trisomy 16 (Ts65Dn) mice have been developed to provide an animal model of Down's syndrome that exhibits progressive loss of BFCNs and cognitive ability. Another feature common to both Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease is neuroinflammation, which may exacerbate neurodegeneration, including cholinergic loss. Minocycline is a semisynthetic tetracycline with antiinflammatory properties that has demonstrated neuroprotective properties in certain disease models. Consistent with a role for inflammatory processes in BFCN degeneration, we have shown previously that minocycline protects BFCNs and improves memory in mice with acute, immunotoxic BFCN lesions.","conclusion":"Minocycline is an established antiinflammatory and neuroprotective drug and may provide a novel approach to treat specific AD-like pathologies."},{"method":"We performed mutation analysis in eight inbred families whose haplotypes link to the PARK6 region.","background":"PINK1 was recently found to be associated with PARK6 as the causative gene.","conclusion":"We identified six pathogenic mutations (R246X, H271Q, E417G, L347P, and Q239X\/R492X) in six unrelated families.

Ligation of the carotid artery 24 hours before hypoxia provided complete neuroprotection and produced improved performance on the Morris water maze compared with ligation performed 1 hour before hypoxia. Carotid artery ligation 6 hours before hypoxia produced intermediate benefit. The 24-hour carotid-artery ligation preconditioning was associated with a robust and sustained activation of a transcription factor, the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), on its phosphorylation site on Ser133. Intracerebroventricular infusions of antisense CREB oligodeoxynucleotides significantly reduced the 24-hour carotid-artery ligation-induced neuroprotection effects by decreasing CREB expressions. Pharmacological activation of the cAMP-CREB signaling with rolipram 24 hours before hypoxia protected rat pups at behavioral and pathological levels by sustained increased CREB phosphorylation.","background":"Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury is a major cause of permanent neurological dysfunction in children.

The resulting figures for sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 64%, 91%, 95%, and 49%, respectively. In the falsely positive cases, Alzheimer's disease (n=4) and vascular dementia (n=1) were the underlying diseases.

We assessed the neuropathology of diseased spinal cords and found that erythropoietin-treated EAE animals had reduced axonal damage, inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelination, and diminished blood-brain barrier leakage when compared with saline-treated EAE controls. Moreover, the pronounced upregulation of spinal cord major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression found in saline-treated EAE was significantly reduced in erythropoietin-treated animals, a finding we replicated in vitro, using microglial cultures.

The synthesis of these 13 proteins requires many nuclear-encoded proteins that participate in mitochondrial DNA replication, transcript production, and a distinctive mitochondrial translation apparatus.","conclusion":"The defect was associated with marked reduction of the 12S rRNA transcript level likely attributed to a nonsense mutation in the MRPS16 gene. A new group of mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders is proposed, resulting from mutations in nuclear encoded components of the mitochondrial translation apparatus."},{"method":"We show that in response to axonal injury, periaxonal Schwann cells release erythropoietin (EPO), which via EPO receptor binding on neurons, prevents axonal degeneration. We demonstrate that the relevant axonal injury signal that stimulates EPO production from surrounding glial cells is nitric oxide. In addition, we show that this endogenous pathway can be therapeutically exploited by administering exogenous EPO.","background":"Clinically relevant peripheral neuropathies (such as diabetic and human immunodeficiency virus sensory neuropathies) are characterized by distal axonal degeneration, rather than neuronal death. Here, we describe a novel, endogenous pathway that prevents axonal degeneration.","conclusion":"In an animal model of distal axonopathy, systemic EPO administration prevents axonal degeneration, and this is associated with a reduction in limb weakness and neuropathic pain behavior.

We hypothesized that when these patients used the hand contralateral to the hypoperfused hemisphere they would show unique activation in motor-related areas of the normally perfused hemisphere, that is, ipsilateral activation.","conclusion":"In addition, although task difficulty had an effect on ipsilateral activation, the increased ipsilateral activation seen in patients was not dependent on task difficulty. Our findings demonstrate that hemodynamic compromise alone is sufficient to cause atypical ipsilateral activation.

This study applies this approach to genetic diseases without obvious blood phenotypes.","conclusion":"Each disease was associated with a unique gene expression pattern in blood that can be accurately distinguished by a classifier. Genes on chromosome 21 were overexpressed in Down's syndrome, and genes controlling cell cycle and proliferation were associated with tuberous sclerosis complex type 2 or neurofibromatosis type 1. A subset of genes involved in cardiac development or remodeling were overexpressed in patients with Down's syndrome and congenital heart defects. These findings suggest that blood gene expression profiling on a broader basis might be useful for genetic disease screening\/diagnosis and might help elucidate mechanisms and pathways that lead to genotype-phenotype differences."},{"method":"We used positron emission tomography to investigate semantic processing within inferior temporal cortex in control subjects and after infarction involving the superior temporal cortex. In the control group, semantic decision making on clear speech activated both anterior fusiform gyri.","background":"During speech comprehension the auditory association cortex in the superior temporal cortex is involved in perceptual analysis of the speech signal, whereas the basal language area in the inferior temporal cortex mediates access to word meaning. Disruption of the interaction between the superior and inferior temporal cortices is one factor that may determine recovery from aphasic stroke.","conclusion":"Chronic aphasic patients were impaired at the task and demonstrated reduced activation within the left anterior fusiform gyrus. A similar pattern of impaired performance and reduced left anterior fusiform gyrus activation was observed when control subjects heard perceptually degraded speech. Performance in both groups predicted activity in the right anterior fusiform gyrus and the temporal poles, where accuracy linearly correlated with activity. These results demonstrate that the function of the basal language area is sensitive to changes in the quality of perceptual input. In addition, different profiles of response observed in each hemisphere suggest distinct contributions of both left and right inferior temporal cortices to the semantic processing of speech."},{"method":"C-peptide replacement from onset of diabetes had no effect on hyperglycemia, but it significantly prevented progressive thermal hyperalgesia and prevented C-fiber atrophy, degeneration, and loss. These findings were associated with preventive effects on impaired availability of nerve growth factor and neurotrophin 3 in the sciatic nerve and significant prevention of perturbed expression of insulin, insulin growth factor-1, nerve growth factor, and neurotrophin 3 receptors in dorsal root ganglion cells. These beneficial effects translated into prevention of the decreased content of dorsal root ganglia nociceptive peptides such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide.","background":"We examined the effects of C-peptide replacement on unmyelinated fiber function in the hind paw, sural nerve C-fiber morphometry, sciatic nerve neurotrophins, and the expression of neurotrophic receptors and content of neuropeptides in dorsal root ganglia in type 1 diabetic BB\/Wor-rats.","conclusion":"From these findings we conclude that replacement of insulinomimetic C-peptide prevents abnormalities of neurotrophins, their receptors, and nociceptive neuropeptides in type 1 BB\/Wor-rats, resulting in the prevention of C-fiber pathology and nociceptive sensory nerve dysfunction. The data indicate that perturbed insulin\/C-peptide action plays an important pathogenetic role in nociceptive sensory neuropathy and that C-peptide replacement may be of benefit in treating painful diabetic neuropathy in insulin-deficient diabetic conditions."},{"method":"Whereas D(1) receptor expression itself is not related to dyskinesia, D(1) sensitivity per D(1) receptor measured by D(1) agonist-induced [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding is linearly related to dyskinesia.","background":"Involuntary movements, or dyskinesia, represent a debilitating complication of levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease.

Our data suggest that levodopa-induced dyskinesia results from increased dopamine D(1) receptor-mediated transmission at the level of the direct pathway."},{"method":"We have studied sensorimotor reorganization in 34 patients with congenital hemiparesis (age range, 5-27 years), using transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging during simple hand movements. Underlying pathologies were brain malformations (first and second trimester lesions; n = 10), periventricular brain lesions (early third trimester lesions; n = 12), and middle cerebral artery infarctions (late third trimester lesions; n = 12). Of this cohort, eight patients with malformations and all patients with periventricular lesions have been published previously.","background":"It is well established that the reorganizational potential of the developing human brain is superior to that of the adult brain, but whether age-dependent differences exist already in the prenatal and perinatal period is not known.","conclusion":"In all three groups of pathologies, transcranial magnetic stimulation identified patients in whom the paretic hand was controlled via ipsilateral corticospinal projections from the contralesional hemisphere (n = 16). In these patients, the motor dysfunction of the paretic hand correlated significantly with the timing period of the underlying brain lesion.

Using a highly malignant human glioma model expressing Renilla luciferase (Rluc), intracranially implanted NPC-FL-sTRAIL expressing both firefly luciferase (Fluc) and S-TRAIL was shown to migrate into the tumors and have profound antitumor effects.","background":"Despite many refinements in current therapeutic strategies, the overall prognosis for a patient with glioblastoma is dismal. Neural precursor cells (NPCs) are capable of tracking glioma tumors and thus could be used to deliver therapeutic molecules.","conclusion":"These studies demonstrate the potential of NPCs as therapeutically effective delivery vehicles for the treatment of gliomas and also provide important tools to evaluate the migration of NPCs and changes in glioma burden in vivo."},{"method":"We investigated the associations between Parkinson's disease and smoking, alcohol, coffee, area of living, and education in a co-twin control study. Because twins are matched for genetic and familial environmental factors, this design controls for confounding by these factors. We also examined control subjects unrelated to cases. Exposure information was taken from questionnaires answered in the 1960s and 1970s. Parkinson's disease cases were identified through the Swedish Inpatient Discharge Register (IDR) and the Cause of Death Register. In the unrelated control subject comparison, 476 Parkinson's disease cases and 2,380 control subjects were included.

We therefore examined prospectively whether individuals who regularly use supplements of the antioxidant vitamins E and C have a lower risk of ALS than nonusers.","conclusion":"During the follow-up, we documented 525 deaths from ALS. Regular use of vitamin E supplements was associated with a lower risk of dying of ALS. The age- and smoking-adjusted relative risk was 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-1.41) among occasional users, 0.59 (95% CI, 0.36-0.96) in regular users for less than 10 years, and 0.38 (95% CI, 0.16-0.92) in regular users for 10 years or more as compared with nonusers of vitamin E (p for trend = 0.004). In contrast, no significant associations were found for use of vitamin C or multivitamins.

Concomitant cerebrovascular lesions increase dementia severity in patients meeting neuropathological criteria for Alzheimer's disease and contribute to cognitive impairment in persons with mild entorhinal Alzheimer lesions. This study investigates whether individuals with sparse neocortical neuritic plaques experience increased odds of crossing the threshold to clinical dementia when they have coexistent cerebrovascular lesions.","conclusion":"Among 333 autopsied men, 120 had dementia, 115 had marginal results, and 98 had normal cognition. In men with neurofibrillary tangles, dementia frequency increased with increasing neuritic plaque density, and increased further in the presence of cerebrovascular lesions. The association was strongest in men with sparse neuritic plaques (1-3\/mm(2)) where dementia frequency more than doubled with coexistent cerebrovascular lesions (45 vs 20%). Among all dementia cases, 24% were linked to cerebrovascular lesions. Findings suggest cerebrovascular lesions are associated with a marked excess of dementia in cases with low neuritic plaque frequency.

However, the heterogeneous clinical presentations of conduction aphasia suggest a greater complexity of perisylvian anatomical connections than allowed for in the classical anatomical model.","conclusion":"Beyond the classical arcuate pathway connecting Broca's and Wernicke's areas directly, we show a previously undescribed, indirect pathway passing through inferior parietal cortex. The indirect pathway runs parallel and lateral to the classical arcuate fasciculus and is composed of an anterior segment connecting Broca's territory with the inferior parietal lobe and a posterior segment connecting the inferior parietal lobe to Wernicke's territory. This model of two parallel pathways helps explain the diverse clinical presentations of conduction aphasia.

The distribution or load of alpha-synuclein pathology did not permit a dependable postmortem diagnosis of extrapyramidal symptoms or cognitive impairment.

Astrocyte proliferation was maximal between 3 weeks and 2 months of age, suggesting that the most rapid period of growth occurs early.

Optic neuritis behaved differently from the other CISs for lower conversion to clinically definite multiple sclerosis and smaller proportion of patients fulfilling MRI dissemination in space, time, or both. Nevertheless, when only patients with abnormal cranial MRI results at baseline were selected, no differences for clinical or MRI conversion were found. Optic neuritis has a smaller risk for conversion to multiple sclerosis.

Apathetic syndrome was associated with a prevalent dorsolateral and frontal medial hypometabolism, whereas the disinhibited syndrome demonstrated a selective hypometabolism in interconnected limbic structures (the cingulate cortex, hippocampus\/amygdala, and accumbens nucleus). The in vivo measurements of [(11)C]MDL indicated a significant reduction of 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptors in orbitofrontal, frontal medial, and cingulate cortices.

The epileptogenic cortex had only marginally increased glutamate levels. We propose that interictal energetic deficiency in the epileptogenic hippocampus could contribute to impaired glutamate reuptake and glutamate-glutamine cycling, resulting in persistently increased extracellular glutamate, glial and neuronal toxicity, increased lactate production together with poor lactate and glucose utilization, and ultimately worsening energy metabolism.

The -2578A\/A genotype was associated with an increased risk for disease, independently of apolipoprotein E genotype. The risk was significantly increased with respect to various VEGF genotype combinations. In contrast, no difference in serum VEGF levels was detected comparing 96 patients and 49 control subjects. These findings suggest that polymorphisms within the promoter region of the VEGF gene confer greater risk for AD, probably by reducing its neuroprotective effect, and confirm the biological role of VEGF in neurodegenerative processes."},{"method":"We genetically characterized four Basque families and found evidence for linkage of autosomal dominant PD to the PARK8 locus, with a maximum 2-point logarithm of odds score of 3.21 (theta = 0.00) for marker D12S345.","background":"During the last few years several loci have been linked to Mendelian forms of Parkinson's disease (PD).

Moreover, the phenotype present in 20% was compatible with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. In 10%, the clinical diagnosis of pure or complicated hereditary spastic paraparesis was made. Electrophysiological studies showed an axonal neuropathy but also chronodispersion of compound motor action potentials and conduction blocks.

We analyzed variants in 60 genes implicated in DLB, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and atypical parkinsonian or dementia disorders, in order to determine their frequency in DLB. We focused on variants that have previously been reported as pathogenic, and also describe variants reported as pathogenic which remain of unknown clinical significance, as well as variants associated with strong risk.","background":"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a clinically heterogeneous disorder with a substantial burden on healthcare.

Additionally, we identified a pathogenic GRN p.Arg493* mutation, potentially adding to the diversity of phenotypes associated with this mutation. The rarity of previously reported pathogenic mutations in this cohort suggests that the genetic overlap of other neurodegenerative diseases with DLB is not substantial.

When compared to astrocytes in control samples, astrocyte signatures in HD also showed downregulated expression of a number of genes, including several associated with protoplasmic astrocyte function and lipid synthesis. Thus, HD astrocytes appeared in variable transcriptional phenotypes, and could be divided into several different \"states\", defined by patterns of gene expression. Ultimately, this study begins to fill the knowledge gap of single cell gene expression in HD and provide a more detailed understanding of the variation in changes in gene expression during astrocyte \"reactions\" to the disease."},{"method":"Here, we report the generation and characterization of mouse lines bearing homologous knock-in of fALS-associated mutation A315T and sALS-associated mutation N390D, respectively.","background":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, adult-onset degenerative disorder of motor neurons. The diseased spinal cord motor neurons of more than 95% of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients are characterized by the mis-metabolism of the RNA\/DNA-binding protein TDP-43 (ALS-TDP), in particular, the presence of cytosolic aggregates of the protein. Most available mouse models for the basic or translational studies of ALS-TDP are based on transgenic overexpression of the TDP-43 protein.","conclusion":"Remarkably, the heterozygous TDP-43 (N390D\/+) mice but not those heterozygous for the TDP-43 (A315T\/+) mice develop a full spectrum of ALS-TDP-like pathologies at the molecular, cellular and behavioral levels. Comparative analysis of the mutant mice and spinal cord motor neurons (MN) derived from their embryonic stem (ES) cells demonstrates that different ALS-associated TDP-43 mutations possess critical ALS-causing capabilities and pathogenic pathways, likely modified by their genetic background and the environmental factors. Mechanistically, we identify aberrant RNA splicing of spinal cord Bcl-2 pre-mRNA and consequent increase of a negative regulator of autophagy, Bcl-2, which correlate with and are caused by a progressive increase of TDP-43, one of the early events associated with ALS-TDP pathogenesis, in the spinal cord of TDP-43 (N390D\/+) mice and spinal cord MN derived from their ES cells.

In line with previous studies, the CP of both controls and progressive MS patients contains relatively high numbers of macrophages and dendritic cells. Moreover, we found virtually no B cells or plasma cells in the CP. MHCII+ antigen-presenting cells were often found in close proximity to T cells, suggesting constitutive CNS immune monitoring functions of the CP. Together, our data highlights the role of the CP in immune homeostasis and indicates the occurrence of mild inflammatory processes in the CP of progressive MS patients.

In astrocyte-neuron co-cultures, astrocytes from prion-infected animals impaired neuronal growth, dendritic spine development and synapse maturation. Toward examining the role of factors secreted by reactive astrocytes, astrocyte-conditioned media was found to have detrimental effects on neuronal viability and synaptogenic functions via impairing synapse integrity, and by reducing spine size and density. Reactive microglia isolated from prion-infected animals were found to induce phenotypic changes in primary astrocytes reminiscent to those observed in prion-infected mice. In particular, astrocytes cultured with reactive microglia-conditioned media displayed hypertrophic morphology and a downregulation of genes involved in neurogenic and synaptogenic functions.

Nucleolar size reduction is greatest in similarly sized alpha motor neurons from C9-ALS cases and results are not skewed by the number of surviving neurons from each ALS spinal cord. Surprisingly, nucleolar shrinkage occurs before main pathological hallmarks-TDP-43 mislocalization or antisense RNA foci-appear and this suggest that nucleolar stress can precede pathology in C9-ALS, findings previously identified in C9-FTLD using sense RNA foci and dipeptide repeat proteins as pathological markers.

Reports of abnormal tau processing following blast injury have raised concerns that some cases may have a neurodegenerative basis. Rats exposed to repetitive low-level blast exhibit chronic neurobehavioral traits and accumulate tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (Thr181).","conclusion":"Elevated p-tau Thr181 in anterior neocortical regions and right hippocampus correlated with anxiety as well as fear learning and novel object localization. There were no correlations with levels in amygdala or posterior neocortical regions. Particularly striking were asymmetrical effects on the right and left hippocampus. No systematic variation in head orientation toward the blast wave seems to explain the laterality. Levels did not correlate with behavioral measures of hyperarousal. Results were specific to Thr181 in that no correlations were observed for three other phospho-acceptor sites (threonine 231, serine 396, and serine 404). No consistent correlations were linked with total tau. These correlations are significant in suggesting that p-tau accumulation in anterior neocortical regions and the hippocampus may lead to disinhibited amygdala function without p-tau elevation in the amygdala itself.

The PML nuclear body generation is induced and fusion occurs over time depending on APP signalling and STED imaging revealed active gene expression within the complex. We further show that the nuclear aggregates of APP-CT50 fragments together with PML and FE65 are present in the aged human brain but not in cerebral organoids differentiated from iPS cells.","background":"The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a type I transmembrane protein with unknown physiological function but potential impact in neurodegeneration.","conclusion":"Notably, human Alzheimer's disease brains reveal a highly significant reduction of these nuclear aggregates in areas with high plaque load compared to plaque-free areas of the same individual.

DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that regulates gene transcription and is known to be involved in AD.","conclusion":"Our analysis uncovered 14 novel CpGs, mapped to genes such as TMEM39A and TNXB that are associated with the AD Braak stage in a sex-specific manner. TMEM39A is known to be involved in inflammation, dysregulated type I interferon responses, and other immune processes. TNXB encodes tenascin proteins, which are extracellular matrix glycoproteins demonstrated to modulate synaptic plasticity in the brain. Moreover, for many previously implicated genes in AD neuropathology, such as MBP and AZU1, our analysis provided the new insights that they were predominately driven by effects in only one sex. These sex-specific DNA methylation differences were enriched in divergent biological processes such as integrin activation in females and complement activation in males.

Increasing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation mediated by microglia and astrocytes contributes to disease progression and severity in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. During AD progression, resident microglia undergo proinflammatory activation, resulting in an increased capacity to convert resting astrocytes to reactive astrocytes. Therefore, microglia are a major therapeutic target for AD and blocking microglia-astrocyte activation could limit neurodegeneration in AD.","conclusion":"Our study indicates that the GLP-1 pathway plays a critical role in microglia-reactive astrocyte associated neuroinflammation in AD and the effects of NLY01 are primarily mediated through a direct action on A&#x3b2;-induced GLP-1R<sup>+<\/sup> microglia, contributing to the inhibition of astrocyte reactivity.

AD pathology is typically associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy due to perivascular accumulation of A&#x3b2;. Heparan sulfate (HS) is an important component of the VBM, thought to fulfill multiple roles in AD pathology.

In response to LPS and during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), VISTA KO and WT microglia shared similar transcriptional profiles and VISTA deletion did not affect EAE disease progression or microglia responses.

Sarm1 wild-type (WT) mice developed significant CC atrophy that was reduced in Sarm1 KO mice. Ultrastructural classification of pathology of individual axons, using electron microscopy, demonstrated that Sarm1 KO preserved more intact axons and reduced damaged or demyelinated axons. Longitudinal MRI studies in live mice identified significantly reduced CC volume after TBI in Sarm1 WT mice that was attenuated in Sarm1 KO mice.

By integrating gene expression analysis, immunofluorescence, genetic and adeno-associated virus expressing TAU mouse models, we found a TAU-dependent increase in CB<sub>2<\/sub> receptor expression in hippocampal neurons, that occurs as an early event in the pathology and was maintained until late stages. These changes were accompanied by alterations in the endocannabinoid metabolism.","background":"Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the alteration\/aggregation of TAU protein, for which there is still no effective treatment.

We also observed EU-labelling accumulating into cytoplasmic inclusions, indicating that EU, like other modified uridines, may introduce non-physiological properties in labelled RNAs. Additionally, we found that EU induces Purkinje cell degeneration nine days after EU injection, suggesting that EU incorporation not only results in abnormal RNA transcripts, but also eventually becomes neurotoxic in highly transcriptionally-active neurons. However, short post-injection intervals of EU labelling in both a Purkinje cell-specific DNA repair-deficient mouse model and a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia 1 revealed reduced transcription in Purkinje cells compared to controls.

However, a comprehensive overview of how the neurovascular unit is affected in a wide range of rare disorders is lacking. Our aim was to provide further insights into the neuropathology of the neurovascular unit in leukodystrophies to unravel its potential pathogenic role in these diseases. Leukodystrophies are monogenic disorders of the white matter due to defects in any of its structural components. Single leukodystrophies are exceedingly rare, and availability of human tissue is unique.","conclusion":"We observed tight junction rearrangements, indicative of endothelial dysfunction, in five out of eight assessed leukodystrophies of different origin and an altered aquaporin-4 distribution in all. Aquaporin-4 redistribution indicates a general astrocytic dysfunction in leukodystrophies, even in those not directly related to astrocytic pathology or without prominent reactive astrogliosis.

Protein synthesis is impaired in neurodegenerative diseases including tauopathies, in which pathology is caused by aberrant changes to the microtubule-associated protein tau. We recently showed that both global de novo protein synthesis and the synthesis of select ribosomal proteins (RPs) are decreased in mouse models of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) which express mutant forms of tau. However, a comprehensive analysis of the effect of FTD-mutant tau on ribosomes is lacking.","conclusion":"We identified 10 RPs which were decreased in abundance in primary neurons taken from the K3 mouse model of FTD. We further demonstrate that expression of human tau (hTau) decreases both protein synthesis and biogenesis of the 60S ribosomal subunit, with these effects being exacerbated in the presence of FTD-associated tau mutations. Lastly, we demonstrate that expression of the amino-terminal projection domain of hTau is sufficient to reduce protein synthesis and ribosomal biogenesis.

Thus, identification of key regulators of medulloblastoma stemness is critical for improving radiotherapy for medulloblastoma.","conclusion":"We found that RBM5-AS1, a novel inducer of medulloblastoma stemness, was significantly upregulated in radioresistant medulloblastoma cells compared to parental cells. Knockdown of RBM5-AS1 diminished the viability and clonogenic survival of both radioresistant and parental medulloblastoma cells after radiation. Silencing of RBM5-AS1 significantly enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis and DNA damage. In vivo studies confirmed that depletion of RBM5-AS1 inhibited tumor growth and increased radiosensitivity in a medulloblastoma xenograft model. In contrast, overexpression of RBM5-AS1 reduced radiation-induced apoptosis and DNA damage in medulloblastoma cells. Mechanistically, RBM5-AS1 interacted with and stabilized sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) protein. Silencing of SIRT6 reduced the stemness and reinforced radiation-induced DNA damage in medulloblastoma cells. Overexpression of SIRT6 rescued medulloblastoma cells from RBM5-AS1 depletion-induced radiosensitization and DNA damage. Overall, we identify RBM5-AS1 as an inducer of stemness and radioresistance in medulloblastoma.

Furthermore, progression of tauopathy in transgenic mice is accompanied by increasing mislocalization of SRRM2 from the neuronal nucleus to the soma. In AD brain tissue, SRRM2 mislocalization associates with increased severity of pathological tau deposition.

Notably, IL-17F knockout mice had enhanced anti-inflammatory macrophages in the NGC repairing microenvironment. In vitro data revealed that IL-17F knockout peritoneal and bone marrow derived macrophages had increased anti-inflammatory markers after treatment with the extracts from chitosan conduits, while higher pro-inflammatory markers were detected in the Raw264.7 macrophage cell line, wild-type peritoneal and bone marrow derived macrophages after the same treatment. The biased anti-inflammatory phenotype of macrophages by IL-17F knockout probably contributed to the improved chitosan conduit guided sciatic nerve regeneration. Additionally, IL-17F could enhance pro-inflammatory factors production in Raw264.7 cells and wild-type peritoneal macrophages. Altogether, IL-17F may partially mediate chitosan conduit induced pro-inflammatory polarization of macrophages during nerve repair.

Here, using super resolution structured illumination microscopy, we find that neither CHMP4B nor CHMP2B are increased in ALS neuronal nuclei. In contrast, VPS4 expression is significantly increased in ALS neuronal nuclei prior to the emergence of nuclear pore injury in a CHMP7 dependent manner.

Although the study is limited to one case, the results support that restoring brain progranulin levels may be sufficient to escape neurodegeneration and FTD.

Unlike prior work in angiogenic brain tumors, we find that expression of secreted Wnt antagonists do not alter the tumor-associated vascular phenotype in DMG tumor models. Together, these findings highlight vascular heterogeneity between pHGG and DMG and differences in their response to alterations in developmental BBB signals that may participate in driving these pathological differences."},{"method":"Our study represents the first examples of comprehensive genomic sequencing in DLGNT and shows that it is not only feasible but crucial to our understanding of this rare disease.","background":"Diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumours (DLGNT) represent rare enigmatic CNS tumours of childhood. Most patients with this disease share common radiological and histopathological features but the clinical course of this disease is variable. A radiological hallmark of this disease is widespread leptomeningeal enhancement that may involve the entire neuroaxis with predilection for the posterior fossa and spine. The classic pathologic features include low- to moderate-density cellular lesions with OLIG2 expression and evidence of 'oligodendroglioma-like' appearance. The MAPK\/ERK signaling pathway has recently been reported as a potential driver of tumourigenesis in up to 80% of DLGNT with KIAA1549:BRAF fusions being the most common event seen. Until now, limited analysis of the biological drivers of tumourigenesis has been undertaken via targeted profiling, chromosomal analysis and immunohistochemistry.","conclusion":"Moreover, we demonstrate that DLGNT may be more genomically complex than single-event MAPK\/ERK signaling pathway tumours."},{"method":"Recently, this has been studied using amyloid precursor protein (APP) overexpression mouse models of AD.

Moreover, also the presence of peripheral inflammation has been extensively documented. However, it is still ambiguous whether this observed inflammation is cause or consequence of AD pathogenesis.","conclusion":"This revealed that low-grade peripheral inflammation affects (1) microglia characteristics, (2) blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier integrity, (3) peripheral immune cell infiltration and (4) A&#x3b2; deposition in the brain. Next, we identified mechanisms that might cause this effect on AD pathology, more precisely A&#x3b2; efflux, persistent microglial activation and insufficient A&#x3b2; clearance, neuronal dysfunction and promotion of A&#x3b2; aggregation. Our results further strengthen the believe that even low-grade peripheral inflammation has detrimental effects on AD progression and may further reinforce the idea to modulate peripheral inflammation as a therapeutic strategy for AD."},{"method":"Here we describe a recurrent RYR1 mutation previously classified as VUS, and we provide clinical, histological, and genetic data supporting its pathogenicity.

Abnormal RyR1 activity compromises normal muscle function and results in various human disorders including malignant hyperthermia, central core disease, and centronuclear myopathy. However, RYR1 is one of the largest genes of the human genome and accumulates numerous missense variants of uncertain significance (VUS), precluding an efficient molecular diagnosis for many patients and families.","conclusion":"The affected individuals essentially manifested neonatal or infancy-onset hypotonia, delayed motor milestones, and a benign disease course differing from classical RYR1-related muscle disorders. Muscle biopsies showed unspecific histological and ultrastructural findings, while RYR1-typical cores and internal nuclei were seen only in single patients. In conclusion, our data evidence the causality of the RYR1 c.12083C&gt;T (p.Ser4028Leu) mutation in the development of an atypical congenital myopathy with gradually improving motor function over the first decades of life, and may direct molecular diagnosis for patients with comparable clinical presentation and unspecific histopathological features on the muscle biopsy."},{"method":"Using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) and biochemical and vibrational spectroscopy techniques, we studied whether Parkinson's disease (PD) patient genomes could modulate alpha-synuclein (aSYN) protein aggregates formation.","background":"Recent studies suggest that brain cell type specific intracellular environments may play important roles in the generation of structurally different protein aggregates that define neurodegenerative diseases.","conclusion":"We found increased &#x3b2;-sheets and aggregated aSYN in PD patient hiPSC-derived midbrain cells, compared to controls.

Microglia are implicated in the restriction of amyloid deposits and play a major role in internalization and degradation of A&#x3b2;. Recent studies showed that rare variants of the Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) are associated with an increased risk for AD. Post-translational modifications of A&#x3b2; could modulate the interaction with TREM2, and the uptake by microglia.","conclusion":"Human brains with rare TREM2 AD risk variants also showed altered deposition of modified A&#x3b2; species in the different brain lesions as compared to cases with the common variant of TREM2.

We developed automated approaches using whole slide images of tau immunostained sections from 49 human autopsy brains (16 AD,13 CBD, 20 PSP) to identify cortex\/white matter regions and individual tau aggregates, and compared tau-aggregate morphology across these diseases.","background":"Although pathology of tauopathies is characterized by abnormal tau protein aggregation in both gray and white matter regions of the brain, neuropathological investigations have generally focused on abnormalities in the cerebral cortex because the canonical aggregates that form the diagnostic criteria for these disorders predominate there. This corticocentric focus tends to deemphasize the relevance of the more complex white matter pathologies, which remain less well characterized and understood.","conclusion":"Tau burden in the gray and white matter for individual subjects strongly correlated in a highly disease-specific fashion. We discovered previously unrecognized tau morphologies for AD, CBD and PSP that may be of importance in disease classification. Intriguingly, our models classified diseases equally well based on either white or gray matter tau staining. Our results suggest that tau pathology in white matter is informative, disease-specific, and linked to gray matter pathology.

In addition, in the pontine base, accumulation of CD68-positive macrophages laden with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive material was observed. Many vacuolar lesions were found in the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres and, to a lesser extent, in the brainstem and spinal cord white matter. Immunohistological examination and ultrastructural observations with an electron microscope suggest that these vacuolar lesions are remnants of degenerated oligodendrocytes. Electron microscopy also revealed myelin sheath destruction. Unexpectedly, aggregation of the four-repeat tau was observed in a spatial pattern reminiscent of progressive supranuclear palsy. The tau lesions included glial fibrillary tangles resembling tuft-shaped astrocytes and neurofibrillary tangles and pretangles.","background":"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 34 (SCA34) is an autosomal dominant inherited ataxia due to mutations in ELOVL4, which encodes one of the very long-chain fatty acid elongases.

However, there have been no previous studies describing the neuropathology of either SCA34 or 38.","conclusion":"This is the first report to illustrate that a heterozygous missense mutation in ELOVL4 leads to neuronal loss accompanied by macrophages laden with PAS-positive material in the pontine base and oligodendroglial degeneration leading to widespread vacuoles in the white matter in SCA34."},{"method":"Here we used Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by a Designer Drug (DREADD) technology to inhibit or activate sensory neurons' firing within the melanoma tumor.","background":"Sensory neurons have recently emerged as components of the tumor microenvironment. Nevertheless, whether sensory neuronal activity is important for tumor progression remains unknown.","conclusion":"Melanoma growth and angiogenesis were accelerated following inhibition of sensory neurons' activity and were reduced following overstimulation of these neurons. Sensory neuron-specific overactivation also induced a boost in the immune surveillance by increasing tumor-infiltrating anti-tumor lymphocytes, while reducing immune-suppressor cells. In humans, a retrospective in silico analysis of melanoma biopsies revealed that increased expression of sensory neurons-related genes within melanoma was associated with improved survival. These findings suggest that sensory innervations regulate melanoma progression, indicating that manipulation of sensory neurons' activity may provide a valuable tool to improve melanoma patients' outcomes."},{"method":"Ex vivo MRI scans were combined using a customized groupwise diffeomorphic registration approach to construct a 3D probabilistic atlas that captures the anatomical variability of the MTL. Using serial histology imaging in eleven specimens, we labelled the MTL subregions in the atlas based on cytoarchitecture.

Our analyses enabled further identification of specific genes and expression patterns, including both known and unknown genes, that could distinguish the three different classes of PitNETs. We conclude that the current classification of PitNETs based on the expression of SF1, PIT1 and TPIT reflects three distinct subtypes of PitNETs with different underlying biology and partly independent from the expression of corresponding hormones.

Systematic search for endosome regulators able to prevent BIN1iso1-induced neurodegeneration indicated that a defect at the early endosome level is responsible for the neurodegeneration. In human induced neurons (hiNs) and cerebral organoids, BIN1 knock-out resulted in the narrowing of early endosomes. This phenotype was rescued by BIN1iso1 but not BIN1iso9 expression.","background":"The Bridging Integrator 1 (BIN1) gene is a major susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Deciphering its pathophysiological role is challenging due to its numerous isoforms.","conclusion":"Finally, BIN1iso1 overexpression also led to an increase in the size of early endosomes and neurodegeneration in hiNs.

National area deprivation statistics were derived for each participant's neighbourhood, for use as a predictor in binary and ordinal logistic models assessing the respective presence and severity of staging of key neuropathological changes, adjusting for theorised confounders.","background":"Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with greater risk of dementia. This has been theorised to reflect inequalities in cognitive reserve, healthcare access, lifestyle, and other health factors which may contribute to the clinical manifestation of dementia.","conclusion":"Individuals from among the 20% most deprived neighbourhoods in the United Kingdom had significantly higher neurofibrillary tangle and neuritic plaque staging, and increased risk of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. These findings were not explained by a greater risk of diabetes or hypertension, APOE genotype, alcohol misuse or tobacco smoking, sex, or age differences. A sensitivity analysis conditioning on baseline cognitive impairment did not meaningfully change the observed association.

In cultured neurons, whereas 50% uniaxial strain was needed to rapidly induce axonal varicosities in a nanowrinkled stretch assay, physiologically-relevant transverse compression effectively induced axonal varicosities in a fluid puffing assay and can generate large but nonuniform deformation simulated by finite element analysis.","background":"Uniaxial stretch is believed to drive diffuse axonal injury (DAI) in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).

Both MSC types ameliorated disease, if delivered during the initial onset of symptomatic disease.","background":"One of the therapeutic approaches for the treatment of the autoimmune demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis (MS) is bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell (hBM-MSCs) transplantation. However, given their capacity to enhance myelination in vitro, we hypothesised that human olfactory mucosa-derived MSCs (hOM-MSCs) may possess additional properties suitable for CNS repair.","conclusion":"Yet, only hOM-MSCs improved disease outcome if administered during established disease when animals had severe neurological deficits. Histological analysis of spinal cord lesions revealed hOM-MSC transplantation reduced blood-brain barrier disruption and inflammatory cell recruitment and enhanced axonal survival. At early time points post-hOM-MSC treatment, animals had reduced levels of circulating IL-16, which was reflected in both the ability of immune cells to secrete IL-16 and the level of IL-16 in spinal cord inflammatory lesions. Further in vitro investigation revealed an inhibitory role for IL-16 on oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. Moreover, the availability of bioactive IL-16 after demyelination was reduced in the presence of hOM-MSCs. Combined, our data suggests that human hOM-MSCs may have therapeutic benefit in the treatment of MS via an IL-16-mediated pathway, especially if administered during active demyelination and inflammation."},{"method":"Using postmortem human AD brain tissue, we show that A&#x3b2; pathology is associated with the necroptosis effector pMLKL.

Additionally, inhibition of necroptosis by pharmacological or genetic means, reduce neurodegeneration and memory impairment triggered by A&#x3b2;o in mice. Since microglial activation is emerging as a central driver for AD pathogenesis, we then tested the contribution of microglia to the mechanism of A&#x3b2;o-mediated necroptosis activation in neurons.

In this study, we investigate the role of TMEM106B in the cerebellum, dysfunction of which has been associated with FTLD and other brain disorders.","conclusion":"Aged TMEM106B-deficient mice show significant loss of Purkinje neurons specifically in the anterior lobe of the cerebellum. Increased microglia and astrocyte activation, as well as an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, p62 and TDP-43 were also detected in the cerebellum of aged TMEM106B deficient mice. In the young mice, myelination defects and a significant loss of synapses between Purkinje and deep cerebellar nuclei neurons were observed. Interestingly, TMEM106B deficiency causes distinct lysosomal phenotypes in different types of neurons and glia in the cerebellum and frontal cortex. In humans, TMEM106B rs1990622 risk allele (T\/T) is associated with increased Purkinje neuron loss.

Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Ezh2 deletion upregulates an inflammatory response with upregulation of immunoproteasome genes such as Psmb8, Psmb9, and Psmb10. Ezh2 gain-of-function resulted in enrichment of the oxidative phosphorylation\/mitochondrial metabolic pathway namely the isocitrate dehydrogenase Idh1\/2\/3 genes. Pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 augmented neural progenitor cell proliferation, supporting the tumor suppressive role of EZH2.

For 10 missense mutations identified in the Belgian cohort we analyzed the pathogenetic effect on protein localization in vitro using immunocytochemistry.","background":"The adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily A member 7 gene (ABCA7) is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in large genome-wide association studies. Targeted sequencing of ABCA7 suggests a role for rare premature termination codon (PTC) mutations in AD, with haploinsufficiency through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay as a plausible pathogenic mechanism. Since other classes of rare variants in ABCA7 are poorly understood, we investigated the contribution and pathogenicity of rare missense, indel and splice variants in ABCA7 in Belgian AD patient and control cohorts.","conclusion":"Our results demonstrate that rare ABCA7 missense mutations can contribute to AD by inducing protein mislocalization, resulting in a lack of functional protein at the plasma membrane. In one pedigree, a mislocalization-inducing missense mutation in ABCA7 (p.G1820S) co-segregated with AD in an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Brain autopsy of six patient missense mutation carriers showed typical AD neuropathological characteristics including cerebral amyloid angiopathy type 1. Also, among the rare ABCA7 missense mutations, we observed mutations that affect amino acid residues that are conserved in ABCA1 and ABCA4, of which some correspond to established ABCA1 or ABCA4 disease-causing mutations involved in Tangier or Stargardt disease."},{"method":"In the well-established Drosophila Tauopathy model, we use genetic interactions to show that Mical alters Tau interactions with microtubules and the Actin cytoskeleton and greatly affects Tau aggregation propensity and Tau-associated toxicity and dysfunction. Exploration of the mechanism was pursued using a Mical inhibitor, a mutation in Mical that selectively disrupts its monooxygenase domain, Tau transgenes mutated at cysteine residues targeted by Mical and mass spectrometry analysis to quantify cysteine oxidation.","background":"Tau accumulation is clearly linked to pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease and other Tauopathies. However, processes leading to Tau fibrillization and reasons for its pathogenicity remain largely elusive. Mical emerged as a novel interacting protein of human Tau expressed in Drosophila brains. Mical is characterized by the presence of a flavoprotein monooxygenase domain that generates redox potential with which it can oxidize target proteins.","conclusion":"The collective evidence strongly indicates that Mical's redox activity mediates the effects on Tau via oxidation of Cys322. Importantly, we also validate results from the fly model in human Tauopathy samples by showing that MICAL1 is up-regulated in patient brains and co-localizes with Tau in Pick bodies. Our work provides mechanistic insights into the role of the Tau cysteine residues as redox-switches regulating the process of Tau self-assembly into inclusions in vivo, its function as a cytoskeletal protein and its effect on neuronal toxicity and dysfunction."},{"method":"Here, we optimized the established anti-IFNAR1 treated, Rag1<sup>-\/-<\/sup> (AIR) mouse model of ZIKV infection to examine the consequence of vertical transmission on neonate survival and postnatal brain development. We found that modulating the infectious dose and the frequency of anti-IFNAR1 treatment of pregnant mice (termed AIR<sup>low<\/sup> mice) prolonged neonatal survival allowing for pathogenesis studies of brain tissues at critical postnatal time points.","background":"The mechanisms by which vertically transmitted Zika virus (ZIKV) causes postnatal brain development abnormalities and congenital disease remain poorly understood.","conclusion":"Postnatal AIR<sup>low<\/sup> mice all had chronic ZIKV infection in the brain that was associated with decreased cortical thickness and cerebellar volume, increased gliosis, and higher levels of cell death in many brain areas including cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum when compared to controls. Interestingly, despite active infection and brain abnormalities, the neurodevelopmental program remained active in AIR<sup>low<\/sup> mice as indicated by elevated mRNA expression of critical neurodevelopmental genes in the brain and enlargement of neural-progenitor rich regions of the cerebellum at a developmental time point analogous to birth in humans. Nevertheless, around the developmental time point when the brain is fully populated by neurons, AIR<sup>low<\/sup> mice developed neurologic disease associated with persistent ZIKV infection in the brain, gliosis, and increased cell death. Together, these data show that vertically transmitted ZIKV infection in the brain of postnatal AIR<sup>low<\/sup> mice strongly influences brain development resulting in structural abnormalities and cell death in multiple regions of the brain."},{"method":"Here we show that Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 5 (Igfbp5), an inhibitory binding protein for insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf-1) accumulates in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and in amyloid plaques in brains of Alzheimer patients. We investigated the pathogenic relevance of this finding with transgenic mice overexpressing Igfbp5 in pyramidal neurons of the brain.","background":"Risk factors such as dysregulation of Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling have been linked to Alzheimer's disease.","conclusion":"Neuronal overexpression of Igfbp5 prevents the training-induced increase of hippocampal and cortical Bdnf expression and reduces the effects of exercise on memory retention, but not on learning acquisition. Hence, elevated IGFBP5 expression could be responsible for some of the early cognitive deficits that occur during the course of Alzheimer's disease."},{"method":"Here, we investigated interface astrogliosis in blast and impact neurotrauma, specifically in the context of RHI and early stage CTE. We compared postmortem brain tissue from former military veterans with a history of blast exposure with and without a neuropathological diagnosis of CTE, former American football players with a history of RHI with and without a neuropathological diagnosis of CTE, and control donors without a history of blast, RHI exposure or CTE diagnosis. Using quantitative immunofluorescence, we found that astrogliosis was higher at the grey-white matter interface in the dorsolateral frontal cortex, with mixed effects at the subpial surface and underlying cortex, in both blast and RHI donors with and without CTE, compared to controls.","background":"Exposure to military blast and repetitive head impacts (RHI) in contact sports is associated with increased risk of long-term neurobehavioral sequelae and cognitive deficits, and the neurodegenerative disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). At present, the exact pathogenic mechanisms of RHI and CTE are unknown, and no targeted therapies are available. Astrocytes have recently emerged as key mediators of the multicellular response to head trauma.","conclusion":"These results indicate that certain astrocytic alterations are associated with both impact and blast neurotrauma, and that different astroglial responses take place in distinct brain regions."},{"method":"Here, we report that muscle from MND patients has an increased proportion of slow fibers and muscle fibers with smaller diameter. Muscle cells cultured from MND biopsies failed to form large clusters of acetylcholine receptors in response to either non-MND human motor axons or n-agrin. Furthermore, levels of expression of MuSK, and MuSK-complex components: LRP4, Caveolin-3, and Dok7 differed between muscle cells cultured from MND patients compared to those from non-MND controls.","background":"A central event in the pathogenesis of motor neuron disease (MND) is the loss of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), yet the mechanisms that lead to this event in MND remain to be fully elucidated. Maintenance of the NMJ relies upon neural agrin (n-agrin) which, when released from the nerve terminal, activates the postsynaptic Muscle Specific Kinase (MuSK) signaling complex to stabilize clusters of acetylcholine receptors.","conclusion":"To our knowledge, this is the first time a fault in the n-agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling pathway has been identified in muscle from MND patients. Our results highlight the n-agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target to prolong muscle function in MND."},{"method":"The human brains used in this study were obtained at the time of foetal autopsies for medical termination of pregnancy, in utero or post-natal early death.","background":"Prenatal alcohol exposure is a major cause of neurobehavioral disabilities. MRI studies in humans have shown that alcohol is associated with white matter microstructural anomalies but these studies focused on myelin abnormalities only after birth. Only one of these studies evaluated oligodendrocyte lineage, but only for a short period during human foetal life. As data are lacking in humans and alcohol is known to impair oligodendrocyte differentiation in rodents, the present study aimed to compare by immunohistochemistry the oligodendrocyte precursor cells expressing PDGFR-&#x3b1; and immature premyelinating\/mature oligodendrocytes expressing Olig2 in the ganglionic eminences and the frontal cortex of 14 human foetuses exposed to alcohol from 15 to 37&#xa0;weeks' gestation with age-matched controls.","conclusion":"Before birth, PDGFR-&#x3b1; expression was strongly increased in the ganglionic eminences and the cortex of all foetuses exposed to alcohol except at the earliest stage. No massive generation of Olig2 immunoreactive cells was identified in the ganglionic eminences until the end of pregnancy and the density of Olig2-positive cells within the cortex was consistently lower in foetuses exposed to alcohol than in controls. These antenatal data from humans provides further evidence of major oligodendrocyte lineage impairment at specific and key stages of brain development upon prenatal alcohol exposure including defective or delayed generation and maturation of oligodendrocyte precursors."},{"method":"Using a model of autoimmune demyelination that exhibits CNS-infiltrating immune cells in both spinal cord white matter and optic nerve, we sought to evaluate neurodegenerative changes due to lesions affecting the spino- and retino-thalamic pathways.","background":"Thalamic volume is associated with clinical disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) and is vulnerable to secondary neurodegeneration due to its extensive connectivity throughout the central nervous system (CNS).","conclusion":"We found comparable axonal loss in spinal cord white matter and optic nerve during the acute phase of disease consistent with synaptic loss, but not neuronal cell body loss in the thalamic nuclei that receive input from these discrete pathways. Loss of spinal cord neurons or retinal ganglion cells retrograde to their respective axons was not observed until the chronic phase of disease, where optical coherence tomography (OCT) documented reduced inner retinal thickness. In patients with relapsing-remitting MS without a history of optic neuritis, OCT measures of inner retinal volume correlated with retino-thalamic (lateral geniculate nucleus) and spino-thalamic (ventral posterior nucleus) volume as well as neuroperformance measures. These data suggest retinal imaging may serve as an important noninvasive predictor of neurodegeneration in MS."},{"method":"We report a newborn patient who was diagnosed with a DIA and died postresection. Pathologic examination revealed that the main part of the tumor had benign features, but the internal region showed areas with a more aggressive appearance, with higher-proliferative cells, anaplastic GFAP positive cells with cellular polymorphism, necrosis foci, vascular hyperplasia with endothelial proliferation and microtrombosis. Genetic study, performed in both regions of the tumor, showed a BRAF V600E mutation and a homozygous deletion in PTEN, without changes in other relevant genes like EGFR, CDKN2A, TP53, NFKBIA, CDK4, MDM2 and PDGFRA.","background":"Desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma (DIA) is rare, cystic and solid tumor of infants usually found in superficial cerebral hemispheres. Although DIA is usually benign, uncommon cases bearing malignant histological and aggressive clinical features have been described in the literature.","conclusion":"Although PTEN homozygous deletions are described in gliomas, the present case constitutes the first report of a PTEN mutation in a DIA, and this genetic feature may be related to the malignant behavior of a usually benign tumor. These genetic findings may point at the need of further and deeper genetic characterization of DIAs, in order to better understand the biology of this tumor and to obtain new prognostic approaches, a better clinical management and targeted therapies, especially in malignant cases of DIA."},{"method":"Using novel as well as previously established highly specific tau antibodies, we demonstrate that contrary to this overwhelmingly accepted fact, as asserted in numerous articles and reviews, in adult human brain, tau is more abundant in cortical gray matter that is enriched in neuronal soma and dendrites compared to white matter that is predominantly rich in neuronal axons.","background":"Tau is a predominantly neuronal, soluble and natively unfolded protein that can bind and stabilize microtubules in the central nervous system. Tau has been extensively studied over several decades, especially in the context of neurodegenerative diseases where it can aberrantly aggregate to form a spectrum of pathological inclusions. The presence of tau inclusions in the form of neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads and dystrophic neurites within senile plaques are essential and defining features of Alzheimer's disease. The current dogma favors the notion that tau is predominantly an axonal protein, and that in Alzheimer's disease there is a redistribution of tau towards the neuronal soma that is associated with the formation of pathological inclusions such as neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads.","conclusion":"Additionally, in Alzheimer's disease tau pathology is significantly more abundant in the brain cortical gray matter of affected brain regions compared to the adjacent white matter regions. These findings have important implications for the biological function of tau as well as the mechanisms involved in the progressive spread of tau associated with the insidious nature of Alzheimer's disease."},{"method":"In this study, we used a cross-model comparison of two mouse models of SBMA to evaluate neuromuscular junction pathology, glycolytic-to-oxidative fiber-type switching, and cytoskeletal alterations in pre- and postsynaptic termini of tibialis anterior (TA), gastrocnemius, and soleus hindlimb muscles.","background":"Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked, neuromuscular neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. The disease is characterized by a selective decrease in fast-muscle power (e.g., tongue pressure, grip strength) accompanied by a selective loss of fast-twitch muscle fibers. However, the relationship between neuromuscular junction (NMJ) pathology and fast-twitch motor unit vulnerability has yet to be explored.","conclusion":"We observed significantly increased NMJ and myofiber pathology in fast-twitch, glycolytic motor units of the TA and gastrocnemius compared to slow-twitch, oxidative motor units of the soleus, as seen by decreased pre- and post-synaptic membrane area, decreased pre- and post-synaptic membrane colocalization, increased acetylcholine receptor compactness, a decrease in endplate area and complexity, and deficits in neurofilament heavy chain. Our data also show evidence for metabolic dysregulation and myofiber atrophy that correlate with severity of NMJ pathology. We propose a model in which the dynamic communicative relationship between the motor neuron and muscle, along with the developmental subtype of the muscle, promotes motor unit subtype specific vulnerability, metabolic alterations, and NMJ pathology."},{"method":"To evaluate cerebellar TDP-43 expression and function in FTLD-TDP, we analyzed TDP-43 protein levels and the splicing of a TDP-43 target, STMN2, in the cerebellum of 95 FTLD-TDP cases and 25 non-neurological disease controls.","background":"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP) is a neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting the frontal and\/or temporal cortices. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that the cerebellum contributes to biochemical, cognitive, and behavioral changes in FTLD-TDP.","conclusion":"Soluble TDP-43 was decreased in the cerebellum of FTLD-TDP cases but a concomitant increase in insoluble TDP-43 was not seen. Truncated STMN2 transcripts, an indicator of TDP-43 dysfunction, were elevated in the cerebellum of FTLD-TDP cases and inversely associated with TDP-43 levels. Additionally, lower cerebellar TDP-43 associated with a younger age at disease onset. We provide evidence of TDP-43 loss of function in the cerebellum in FTLD-TDP, supporting further investigation into this understudied brain region."},{"method":"We performed a neuropathological analysis of mouse PAS granules and human CA and correlated these findings with AD progression. Increased PAS granule density was observed in symptomatic tau transgenic mice and APOE knock-in mice. Using a cohort of postmortem AD brain samples, we examined CA in cognitively normal and dementia patients across Braak stages with varying APOE status.","background":"Corpora amylacea (CA) and their murine analogs, periodic acid Schiff (PAS) granules, are age-related, carbohydrate-rich structures that serve as waste repositories for aggregated proteins, damaged cellular organelles, and other cellular debris. The structure, morphology, and suspected functions of CA in the brain imply disease relevance. Despite this, the link between CA and age-related neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), remains poorly defined.","conclusion":"We identified a Braak-stage dependent bimodal distribution of CA in the dentate gyrus, with CA accumulating and peaking by Braak stages II-III, then steadily declining with increasing tau burden. Refined analysis revealed an association of CA levels with both cognition and APOE status. Finally, tau was detected in whole CA present in human patient cerebrospinal fluid, highlighting CA-tau as a plausible prodromal AD biomarker. Our study connects hallmarks of the aging brain with the emergence of AD pathology and suggests that CA may act as a compensatory factor that becomes depleted with advancing tau burden."},{"method":"Here we show that AS form independently from intra-axonal Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> changes, which are required primarily for the persistence of AS in time. We further show that the majority of axonal proteins undergoing de\/phosphorylation immediately following injury belong to the cytoskeleton. This correlates with an increase in the distance of the actin\/spectrin periodic rings and with microtubule tracks remodeling within AS. Observed cytoskeletal rearrangements support axonal transport without major interruptions.","background":"Axonal swellings (AS) are one of the neuropathological hallmark of axonal injury in several disorders from trauma to neurodegeneration. Current evidence proposes a role of perturbed Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> homeostasis in AS formation, involving impaired axonal transport and focal distension of the axons. Mechanisms of AS formation, in particular moments following injury, however, remain unknown.","conclusion":"Our results demonstrate that the earliest axonal response to injury consists in physiological adaptations of axonal structure to preserve function rather than in immediate pathological events signaling axonal destruction."},{"method":"Here, using PMX205, a potent, specific C5aR1 antagonist, in the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease we show a striking reduction in dystrophic neurites in parallel with the reduced amyloid load, rescue of the excessive pre-synaptic loss associated with AD cognitive impairment and the polarization of microglial gene expression towards a DAM-like phenotype that are consistent with the neuroprotective effects seen.","background":"Multiple studies have recognized the involvement of the complement cascade during Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. However, the specific role of C5a-C5aR1 signaling in the progression of this neurodegenerative disease is still not clear. Furthermore, its potential as a therapeutic target to treat AD still remains to be elucidated. Canonically, generation of the anaphylatoxin C5a as the result of complement activation and interaction with its receptor C5aR1 triggers a potent inflammatory response. Previously, genetic ablation of C5aR1 in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease exerted a protective effect by preventing cognitive deficits.","conclusion":"These data support the beneficial effect of a pharmacological inhibition of C5aR1 as a promising therapeutic approach to treat Alzheimer's disease. Supportive of the safety of this treatment is the recent FDA-approval of another other C5a receptor 1 antagonist, Avacopan, as a treatment for autoimmune inflammatory diseases."},{"method":"We report that despite displaying similar basal transport speeds, stimulation of wild-type MNs with BDNF enhances in vivo trafficking of signalling endosomes specifically in FMNs. This BDNF-mediated enhancement of transport was also observed in primary ventral horn neuronal cultures.","background":"Axonal transport ensures long-range delivery of essential cargoes between proximal and distal compartments, and is needed for neuronal development, function, and survival. Deficits in axonal transport have been detected at pre-symptomatic stages in the SOD1<sup>G93A<\/sup> and TDP-43<sup>M337V<\/sup> mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), suggesting that impairments in this critical process are fundamental for disease pathogenesis. Strikingly, in ALS, fast motor neurons (FMNs) degenerate first whereas slow motor neurons (SMNs) are more resistant, and this is a currently unexplained phenomenon. The main aim of this investigation was to determine the effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on in vivo axonal transport in different &#x3b1;-motor neuron (MN) subtypes in wild-type (WT) and SOD1<sup>G93A<\/sup> mice.","conclusion":"However, FMNs display selective impairment of axonal transport in vivo in symptomatic SOD1<sup>G93A<\/sup> mice, and are refractory to BDNF stimulation, a phenotype that was also observed in primary embryonic SOD1<sup>G93A<\/sup> neurons. Furthermore, symptomatic SOD1<sup>G93A<\/sup> mice display upregulation of the classical non-pro-survival truncated TrkB and p75<sup>NTR<\/sup> receptors in muscles, sciatic nerves, and Schwann cells.

On the technical aspects, we observed that LCM-isolated cells show higher within-cell read depth variation compared to cells isolated with FACS. To reduce within-cell read depth variation, we proposed a principal component analysis-based denoising approach that significantly improves signal-to-noise ratios.

The neuropathological evaluation revealed a demyelinating lesion with marked tissue vacuolization and granular myelin disintegration accompanied by mild T cell infiltration and a notable absence of myelin uptake by macrophages. Oligodendrocytes were strikingly enlarged, displaying oncocytic characteristics and showed cytoplasmic accumulation of mitochondria, which had mildly abnormal morphology on electron microscopy.","background":"We report the case of a 22-year-old woman presenting with an acute onset of dizziness, gait dysbalance and blurred vision.","conclusion":"The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was excluded.

This has increased the applicability of targeted-next generation sequencing in the diagnostic work-up of neuropathology specimens and in addition, raises the question of whether targeted sequencing can, in practice, reliably replace older, more traditional diagnostic methods such as immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in-situ hybridization.","conclusion":"Along with detecting the same molecular data obtained from older methods, targeted-next generation sequencing with an RNA sequencing component provides additional information regarding the presence of RNA based alterations that have diagnostic significance and possible therapeutic implications. From this work, we advocate for expanded use of targeted-next generation sequencing over more traditional methods for the detection of important molecular alterations as a part of the standard diagnostic work up for CNS neoplasms."},{"method":"To address that question, we conducted a systematic review and performed original analyses on tau positron emission tomography (PET) data. We searched EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science databases until October 2022. We also implemented several methods for AD subtyping on tau PET to identify hippocampal sparing AD cases.","background":"Neuropathology and neuroimaging studies have identified several subtypes of Alzheimer's disease (AD): hippocampal sparing AD, typical AD, and limbic predominant AD. An unresolved question is whether hippocampal sparing AD cases can present with neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in association cortices while completely sparing the hippocampus.","conclusion":"Our findings show that seven out of the eight reviewed neuropathologic studies included cases at Braak stages IV or higher and therefore, could not identify hippocampal sparing cases with NFT completely sparing the hippocampus. In contrast, tau PET did identify AD participants with tracer retention in the association cortex while completely sparing the hippocampus. We conclude that tau PET can identify hippocampal sparing AD cases with NFT completely sparing the hippocampus. Based on the accumulating data, we suggest two possible pathways of tau spread: (1) a canonical pathway with early involvement of transentorhinal cortex and subsequent involvement of limbic regions and association cortices, and (2) a less common pathway that affects association cortices with limbic involvement observed at end stages of the disease or not at all."},{"method":"Here we found that spastin binds with greater affinity to CHMP2B<sup>Intron5<\/sup> than to CHMP2B<sup>WT<\/sup> and colocalizes with CHMP2B<sup>Intron5<\/sup> in p62-positive aggregates.

However, the handful of published papers on degus of differing genetic backgrounds yield inconsistent findings about sporadic AD-like pathological features, with notably differing results between lab in-bred degus versus outbred degus. This motivates more extensive characterization of spontaneously occurring AD-like pathology and behavior in degus.","conclusion":"Compared to the aged degus that show normal burrowing behavior, the age-matched degus with burrowing behavior deficits correlatively exhibit detectable human AD-like A&#x3b2; deposits and tau neuropathology, along with neuroinflammatory markers that include enhanced microglial activation and higher numbers of reactive astrocytes in the brain. This subset of cognitively impaired aged degus also exhibits cerebral amyloid angiopathy and tauopathy. We find robust neurodegenerative features in behaviorally deficient aged degus, including hippocampal neuronal loss, altered parvalbumin and perineuronal net staining in the cortex, and increased c-Fos neuronal activation in the cortex that is consistent with the neural circuit hyperactivity reported in human AD patients. By focusing on the subset of aged degus that show AD-like behavioral deficits and correlative neuropathology, our findings establish outbred degus as a natural model of sporadic AD and demonstrate the potential importance of wild-type outbred genetic backgrounds for AD pathogenesis."},{"method":"Herein, we established a model of the wfs1b globally deficient zebrafish line. wfs1b deficiency severely impeded the Mauthner-cell (M-cell) axon regeneration, which was partly dependent on the ER stress response.

After SAH, there was significant impairment in the IPAD system: marked expansion of perivascular spaces, and ISF clearance rate was significantly decreased, associated with the apoptosis of endothelial cells, activation of astrocytes, over-expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 and loss of collagen type IV. In conclusion, experimental SAH leads to a failure of IPAD, clinically significant for long term complications such as CAA, following SAH."},{"method":"To identify critical determinants of NMJ remodeling in response to injury, we performed temporal transcriptional profiling of NMJs from 2&#xa0;month-old mice during MAT degeneration\/regeneration, and cross-referenced the differentially expressed genes with those elicited by H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub> in SCs.","background":"Regeneration of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) leverages on extensive exchange of factors released from motor axon terminals (MATs), muscle fibers and perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs), among which hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub>) is a major pro-regenerative signal.","conclusion":"We identified an enrichment in extracellular matrix (ECM) transcripts, including Connective Tissue Growth Factor (Ctgf), which is usually expressed during development. We discovered that Ctgf levels are increased in a Yes-associated protein (YAP)-dependent fashion in response to rapid, local H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub> signaling generated by stressed mitochondria in the injured sciatic nerve, a finding highlighting the importance of signals triggered by mechanical force to motor nerve repair.

Other than mental retardation, the neurological examination was unremarkable, with exception of 2 affected subjects who had mild generalized rigidity and ataxia.","conclusion":"The syndrome we describe, designated X-linked mental retardation and epilepsy, is clinically and genetically distinct from X-linked West syndrome and other X-linked mental retardation-epilepsy syndromes."},{"method":"In order to investigate N-acetylaspartate specificity for white matter axons, transected rat optic nerves were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and immunohistochemistry.","background":"Axonal pathology is a major cause of neurological disability in multiple sclerosis. Axonal transection begins at disease onset but remains clinically silent because of compensatory brain mechanisms. Noninvasive surrogate markers for axonal injury are therefore essential to monitor cumulative disease burden in vivo. The neuronal compound N-acetylaspartate, as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, is currently the best and most specific noninvasive marker of axonal pathology in multiple sclerosis. The possibility has been raised, however, that N-acetylaspartate is expressed also by oligodendroglial lineage cells.","conclusion":"In transected adult nerves, N-acetylaspartate and N-acetyl aspartylglutamate decreased in concordance with axonal degeneration and were undetectable 24 days posttransection. Nonproliferating oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, oligodendrocytes, and myelin were abundant in these axon-free nerves. At 24 days posttransection, N-acetylaspartate was increased (42%; p = 0.02) in nontransected contralateral nerves. After transection at postnatal day 4, total N-acetylaspartate decreased by 80% (P14; p = 0.002) and 94% (P20; p = 0.003). In these developing axon-free nerves, 25 to 33% of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells were proliferating. These data validate magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements of N-acetylaspartate as an axon-specific monitor of central nervous system white matter in vivo. In addition, the results indicate that neuronal adaptation can increase N-acetylaspartate levels, and that 5 to 20% of the N-acetylaspartate in developing white matter is synthesized by proliferating oligodendrocyte progenitor cells."},{"method":"Healthy human volunteers underwent a training period of voluntary thumb movements under the effects of placebo or d-amphetamine in different sessions in a randomized double-blind, counterbalanced design. Previous work in a drug-naive condition showed that such training causes changes in the direction of thumb movements evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation and in transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked electromyographic responses.

Interleukin-10, a dominant endogenous inhibitor of interleukin-12, is largely protective in these experimental surrogates for multiple sclerosis. Such data have suggested that an interleukin-12\/interleukin-10 immunoregulatory circuit is a key determinant of disease expression in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. For multiple sclerosis itself, compatible cytokine data have been reported. The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of interferon-beta in multiple sclerosis remain unclear, hampering the search for more effective therapies. Of note, interferon-beta has reciprocal effects on these cytokines in vitro, suppressing interleukin-12 and augmenting interleukin-10 production.","conclusion":"Before therapy, multiple sclerosis patients exhibited increased stimulatable interleukin-12 production compared with controls. Interferon-beta therapy leads to inhibition of interleukin-12 and augmentation of interleukin-10 production, significantly elevating the ratio of secreted interleukin-10 to interleukin-12.

There was no benefit if treatment was given 2 hours after the initiation of SE. Phenobarbital was most effective in suppressing electrographic seizure activity, but MK-801 had a slightly wider window for the prevention of chronic epilepsy. Early treatment, rather than electrographic suppression of SE, correlated with prevention of chronic epilepsy. This study shows that the drugs administered, which have different mechanisms of action, have clear differences in altering the outcomes. The findings suggest that studies of SE treatment should examine the effect of therapy on SE itself, as well as the long-term benefits of each treatment.

Surprisingly, only a fraction of neuronal intranuclear inclusions were immunopositive for antibodies directed against subunits of the 20S proteolytic core, whereas most inclusions were stained by antibodies directed against subunits of the 11S and 19S regulatory particles. These results suggest that the proteosomal proteolytic machinery that actively degrades neuronal intranuclear inclusions is assembled in only a fraction of pontine neurons in end stage spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.

In contrast, function in the entorhinal cortex declines pathologically. Single-subject analysis revealed that hippocampal dysfunction, found in 60% of elders was selectively correlated with memory decline.

Arterial contact was detected at the root exit zone of the symptomatic right trochlear nerve in all 6 patients (100%). No arterial contact was identified at the root exit zone of the asymptomatic left trochlear nerve in any of the 5 left nerves visualized. In conclusion, superior oblique myokymia can result from neurovascular contact at the root exit zone of trochlear nerve, and therefore should be considered among the neurovascular compression syndromes."},{"method":"Based on the observations of 3 new cases, we confirm the phenotype in affected boys, describe additional MRI findings, report the neuropathological data, and show that carrier females may exhibit neurological and magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities.","background":"X-linked lissencephaly with absent corpus callosum and ambiguous genitalia is a newly recognized syndrome responsible for a severe neurological disorder of neonatal onset in boys.","conclusion":"In affected boys, consistent clinical features of X-linked lissencephaly with absent corpus callosum and ambiguous genitalia are intractable epilepsy of neonatal onset, severe hypotonia, poor responsiveness, genital abnormalities, and early death. On magnetic resonance imaging, a gyration defect consisting of anterior pachygyria and posterior agyria with a moderately thickened brain cortex, dysplastic basal ganglia and complete agenesis of the corpus callosum are consistently found. Neuropathological examination of the brain shows a trilayered cortex containing exclusively pyramidal neurons, a neuronal migration defect, a disorganization of the basal ganglia, and gliotic and spongy white matter. Finally, females related to affected boys may have mental retardation and epilepsy, and they often display agenesis of the corpus callosum. These findings expand the phenotype of X-linked lissencephaly with absent corpus callosum and ambiguous genitalia, may help in the detection of carrier females in affected families, and give arguments for a semidominant X-linked mode of inheritance."},{"method":"Data were analyzed using DTI-based, color-coded images and a 3-D tract reconstruction technique for the study of altered white matter anatomy. Each tumor was near two major white matter tracts, namely, the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the corona radiata. Those tracts were identified using the color-coded maps, and spatial relationships with the tumors were characterized.","background":"We applied multislice, whole-brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to two patients with anaplastic astrocytoma.","conclusion":"In one patient the tumor displaced adjacent white matter tracts, whereas in the other it infiltrated the superior longitudinal fasciclus without displacement of white matter. DTI provides new information regarding the detailed relationship between tumor growth and nearby white matter tracts, which may be useful for preoperative planning."},{"method":"We show that the CLN2 gene is neuroprotective: it enhances growth of NT2 cells and maintains survival of human postmitotic hNT neurons. Conversely, blocking CLN3 or CLN2 expression in hNT neurons with adenoviral antisense-CLN3 or antisense-CLN2-AAV2 constructs causes apoptosis. The drug flupirtine is a triaminopyridine derivative that acts as a nonopioid analgesic. Flupirtine upregulates Bcl-2, increases glutathione levels, activates an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, and delays loss of intermitochondrial membrane calcium retention capacity.","background":"Multiple gene defects cause Batten disease. Accelerated apoptosis accounts for neurodegeneration in the late infantile and juvenile forms that are due to defects in the CLN3 and CLN2 genes. Extensive neuronal death is seen in CLN2- and CLN3-deficient human brain as well as in CLN6-deficient sheep brain and retina. When neurons in late infantile and juvenile brain survive, they manage to do so by upregulating the neuroprotective molecule Bcl-2. The CLN3 gene has antiapoptotic properties at the molecular level.","conclusion":"We show that flupirtine aborts etoposide-induced apoptosis in CLN1-, CLN2-, CLN3-, and CLN6-deficient as well as normal lymphoblasts. Flupirtine also prevents the death of CLN3- and CLN2-deficient postmitotic hNT neurons at the mitochondrial level. We show that a mechanism of neuroprotection exerted by flupirtine involves complete functional antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate or N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced neuronal apoptosis. Flupirtine may be useful as a drug capable of halting the progression of neurodegenerative diseases caused by dysregulated apoptosis."},{"method":"In the present study, we combined IN-1 treatment with an ischemic lesion (permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion) to determine the effect of Nogo-A neutralization on cortical plasticity and functional recovery.","background":"Stroke is a prevalent and devastating disorder, and no treatment is currently available to restore lost neuronal function after stroke occurs. One unique therapy that may improve functional recovery after stroke is blockade of the neurite inhibitory protein Nogo-A with the monoclonal antibody IN-1, through enhancement of neuroanatomical plasticity from uninjured areas of the central nervous system.","conclusion":"We report here that, following ischemic stroke and treatment with IN-1, adult rats demonstrated functional recovery on a forelimb-reaching task and new cortico-efferent projections from the opposite, unlesioned hemisphere. These results support the efficacy of Nogo-A blockade as a treatment for ischemic stroke and implicate plasticity from the unlesioned hemisphere as a mechanism for recovery."},{"method":"To characterize genetic events associated with B8 mouse astrocytoma formation, we employed comparative gene expression profiling of wild-type cultured mouse astrocytes, non-neoplastic B8 astrocytes, B8 astrocytoma cultures, and two other astrocytoma cultures from independently derived RAS transgenic mouse lines.","background":"Based on previous studies demonstrating increased RAS activity in human astrocytomas, we developed a transgenic mouse model (B8) that targets an activated RAS molecule to astrocytes. Within 3 to 4 months after birth, these mice develop high-grade astrocytomas that are histologically identical to human astrocytomas.","conclusion":"We identified several classes of gene expression changes, including those associated with the non-neoplastic state in the B8 transgenic mouse, those associated with astrocytoma formation, and those specifically associated with only one of the three independently derived transgenic mouse astrocytomas. Differential expression of several unique genes was confirmed at the protein level in both the RAS transgenic mouse astrocytomas and two human glioblastoma multiforme cell lines. Furthermore, reexpression of one of these downregulated astrocytoma-associated proteins, GAP43, resulted in C6 glioma cell growth suppression. The use of this transgenic mouse model to identify novel genetic changes that might underlie the pathogenesis of human high-grade astrocytomas provides a unique opportunity to discover future targets for brain tumor therapy."},{"method":"Of note, dramatic reduction of ipsilateral SM1 deactivation (loss of antagonistic pattern) was observed during movement of intact hands by patients with unilateral brachial plexus injury.","background":"This functional magnetic resonance imaging study verified an antagonistic pattern in which a concomitant deactivation of ipsilateral primary sensorimotor (SM1) was coupled to the contralateral SM1 activation in healthy controls during unimanual hand grasping.","conclusion":"We propose that the disappearance of the antagonistic pattern of SM1 activities in the patients with brachial plexus injury reflects a reduction of interhemispheric inhibition, which may mirror an adaptive mechanism to functional status."},{"method":"The sural nerve biopsy exhibited minifascicle formations accompanied by a marked decrease in myelinated fibers.","background":"This case report is of a patient with 46XY pure gonadal dysgenesis, who presented with chronic progressive motor and sensory polyneuropathy.","conclusion":"This is the first report of polyneuropathy with minifascicle formations in 46XY pure gonadal dysgenesis. Because a similar polyneuropathy was recently reported in a case with 46XY partial gonadal dysgenesis, it is possible that these cases represent a new type of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy associated with gonadal dysgenesis."},{"method":"We used repetitive learning and free recall of abstract geometric patterns during functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess episodic memory in older subjects (ages 56-64 years) who sought first-time medical attention with subjective memory complaints and were diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease (NINCDS-ADRDA criteria; ages 51-67 years) or major depressive disorder (DSM-IV; ages 50-65 years).","background":"Patients with probable Alzheimer's disease and depressive patients frequently present with subjective memory complaints. Objective distinction of underlying neuronal substrate malfunction and early cross-sectional differential diagnosis have been elusive thus far.","conclusion":"Contrasting healthy seniors or depressive patients with Alzheimer's disease patients revealed superiority of hippocampal activation. Contrasting Alzheimer's disease patients with seniors showed bilateral prefrontal activity as a correlate of futile compensation of episodic memory failure. Contrasting patients who had major depressive disorder with seniors or patients who had Alzheimer's disease showed bilateral activation of the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate. Subjective memory complaints may be classified objectively and very early with functional magnetic resonance imaging of episodic memory in groups of patients with Alzheimer's disease and depressive syndrome. This may facilitate drug trials with evaluation of specific treatments, but further studies will be needed to establish the differential diagnosis for the individual patient."},{"method":"To examine these changes, four episodes of CSD at 5-minute intervals were induced in the mouse brain by application of 300mM KCl, and gene expression was examined 2 hours later using cDNA array and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Controls consisted of groups that received anesthesia only, attachment of recording electrodes only, and application of 0.9% NaCl.","background":"Cortical spreading depression (CSD) may be the underlying mechanism of migraine aura. The role of CSD in initiating a migraine headache remains to be determined, but it might involve specific changes in gene expression in the brain.","conclusion":"Of the over 1,180 genes examined in our experiments, those consistently regulated by CSD included vasoactive peptides; the vasodilator atrial natriuretic peptide was induced by CSD, while the vasoconstrictor neuropeptide Y was downregulated. Other genes specifically regulated by CSD were involved in oxidative stress responses (major prion protein, glutathione-S-transferase-5, and apolipoprotein E). L-type calcium channel mRNA was upregulated. In summary, CSD regulates genes that are intrinsic to its propagation, that identify accompanying vascular responses as a potential source of pain, and that protect against its potential pathological consequences. We believe these observations have strong relevance to the mechanisms of migraine and its outcomes."},{"method":"We show that intravenous GTN increases NO production within macrophages. L-N(6)-(1-iminoethyl)lysine, a selective iNOS inhibitor, attenuates the NO signal, emphasizing the importance of enzymatic activity to delayed NO production. iNOS expression is preceded by significant nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity, as reflected by a reduction in the inhibitory protein-kappa-Balpha (IkappaBalpha) and activation of NF-kappaB after GTN infusion. IkappaBalpha degradation, NF-kappaB activation, and iNOS expression were attenuated by parthenolide (3mg\/kg), the active constituent of feverfew, an anti-inflammatory drug used for migraine treatment.","background":"Nitric oxide (NO) generated from inducible NO synthase (iNOS) participates in immune and inflammatory responses in many tissues. The NO donor glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) provokes delayed migraine attacks when infused into migraineurs and also causes iNOS expression and delayed inflammation within rodent dura mater. Sodium nitroprusside, an NO donor as well, also increases iNOS expression. Because inflammation and iNOS are potential therapeutic targets, we examined transcriptional regulation of iNOS following GTN infusion and the consequences of its inhibition within dura mater.","conclusion":"These findings suggest that GTN promotes NF-kappaB activity and inflammation with a time course consistent with migraine attacks in susceptible individuals. We conclude, based on results with this animal model, that blockade of NF-kappaB activity provides a novel transcriptional target for the development of anti-migraine drugs."},{"method":"We used the Braak method of staging Alzheimer's disease pathology in 130 women ages 76-102 years who were participants in the Nun Study, a longitudinal study of aging and Alzheimer's disease. All participants had complete autopsy data and were free from neuropathologic conditions other than Alzheimer's disease lesions that could affect cognitive function.","background":"The development of interventions designed to delay the onset of dementia highlights the need to determine the neuropathologic characteristics of individuals whose cognitive function ranges from intact to demented, including those with mild cognitive impairments.","conclusion":"Findings showed a strong relationship between Braak stage and cognitive state. The presence of memory impairment was associated with more severe Alzheimer's disease pathology and higher incidence of conversion to dementia in the groups classified as having mild or global cognitive impairments. In addition to Braak stage, atrophy of the neocortex was significantly related to the presence of dementia. Our data indicate that Alzheimer's neurofibrillary pathology is one of the neuropathologic substrates of mild cognitive impairments. Additional studies are needed to help explain the variability in neuropathologic findings seen in individuals whose cognitive performance falls between intact function and dementia."},{"method":"We carried out a general population study, conducting a random telephone survey with a structured questionnaire, which included a validated screening instrument (a Chinese version of the Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale). It was followed by clinical-polysomnographic-HLA confirmation of the subjects determined to be positive for narcolepsy based on the questionnaire. Of 9,851 subjects interviewed, 28 subjects (0.28%, 58% female) were screened positive. Ninety percent had a second detailed interview, 64% had HLA typing, and over half of them had a sleep assessment.","background":"Narcolepsy is a lifelong, crippling sleep disorder. Although the discovery of the hypocretin system has been a breakthough in genetics, the epidemiological aspects of narcolepsy remain elusive. Ethnic predisposition was suggested to partially account for the 2,500-fold difference in the reported prevalence rates of narcolepsy between Japanese (0.59%) and Israeli Jews (0.00023%).","conclusion":"Only three subjects were found to have genuine narcolepsy. The most common nonnarcolepsy diagnoses were sleep apnea syndrome and sleep-wake schedule disorder. The prevalence rate of narcolepsy in Southern (Hong Kong) Chinese was found to be 0.034% (95% confidence interval = 0.010-0.117%). All available narcoleptic subjects were HLA DRB1-1501 positive and 50% were DQB1-0602 positive. The prevalence rate of narcolepsy among Chinese is comparable to the rates for other populations in studies with stringent epidemiological designs, suggesting that major cross-ethnic differences in the prevalence rates of narcolepsy previously reported likely resulted from methodological limitations."},{"method":"In this patient, we found frontal and temporal neuronal loss, glial-predominant tau deposits, progressive supranuclear palsy-like straight tubules, accumulation of 4-repeat-predominant Sarkosyl-insoluble tau, and a novel exon 1 (Arg5His) tau gene mutation. This mutation decreased microtubule-promoting capacity and increased fibrillation of tau in vitro.","background":"We report a case of frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 of 5 years' duration in an 81-year-old man whose brother had died at age 86 years with dementia.","conclusion":"Thus, we consider that the Arg5His mutation is an authentic tau gene abnormality responsible for the patient's tau pathology and late-onset dementia."},{"method":"A significant increase in cerebrospinal fluid activity was seen in the patients with meningitis and acute febrile illness in comparison with the control subjects. The activity was also significantly higher in the patients with meningitis than in the patients with inflammatory neurological diseases. In addition, the biochemical profile of cerebrospinal fluid platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase was different from other known acetylhydrolases.","background":"Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase was analyzed in cerebrospinal fluid samples taken from children with a variety of neurological conditions (85 patients; mean age, 3.8 years) to determine it is involved in the defense mechanism against the toxic effect of inflammatory mediators in the central nervous system.","conclusion":"These findings suggest that cerebrospinal fluid platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase activity may be a sensitive marker of the host response to central nervous system infections."},{"method":"On sagittal in situ magnetic resonance imaging, 1 case had a normal spinal cord, 2 had only focal lesions, 3 had a combination of focal and diffuse abnormalities, and 1 had only diffuse abnormalities.","background":"In this study, we compared direct postmortem in situ (whole-corpse) sagittal spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (1.5T) of 7 multiple sclerosis cases with targeted high-resolution in vitro axial magnetic resonance imaging (4.7T) and histopathology.","conclusion":"All spinal cords showed abnormalities on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology, confirming the existence of diffuse cord changes as genuine multiple sclerosis-related abnormalities while highlighting the limited resolution of in vivo magnetic resonance imaging."},{"method":"We studied the efficacy of learning to read braille as a method of sensory training for patients with focal hand dystonia. Sensory spatial discrimination was evaluated in 10 patients who had focal hand dystonia and 10 age- and gender-matched controls with a spatial acuity test (JVP domes were used in this test). Clinical dystonia evaluation included the Fahn dystonia scale and time needed to write a standard paragraph. Each individual was trained in braille reading at the grade 1 level for 8 weeks, between 30 and 60 minutes daily, and was monitored closely to ensure that reading was done regularly.","background":"Some patients with focal hand dystonia have impaired sensory perception. Abnormal sensory processing may lead to problems with fine motor control. For patients with focal hand dystonia who demonstrate sensory dysfunction, sensory training may reverse sensory impairment and dystonic symptoms.","conclusion":"Both controls and patients demonstrated improvement on the spatial acuity test. Patients showed a significant mean difference from baseline to 8 weeks on the Fahn dystonia scale. Sixty percent of the patients shortened the time they needed to write a standard paragraph. Improved sensory perception correlated positively with improvement on the Fahn dystonia scale. We conclude that training in braille reading improves deficits in spatial discrimination and decreases disability in patients with focal hand dystonia."},{"method":"In the autopsied putamen of an asymptomatic GCH1 mutation carrier, we found that brain biopterin loss (-82%) paralleled that reported in dopa-responsive dystonia patients (-84%).

We tested 14 healthy women during the early follicular (low estradiol, low progesterone), late follicular (high estradiol, low progesterone), and luteal (high estradiol, high progesterone) phases, with interstimulus intervals from 2 to 10msec (10 trials at each interval and 40 unconditioned trials). We calculated the ratio of the conditioned MEP at each interval to the mean unconditioned MEP: the higher the ratio, the less inhibition and the more facilitation caused by the first stimulus.","background":"Ovarian steroids appear to alter neuronal function in women, but direct physiological evidence is lacking. In animals, estradiol enhances excitatory neurotransmission. Progesterone-derived neurosteroids increase GABAergic inhibition. The effect of weak transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex on the motor evoked potential (MEP) from transcranial magnetic stimulation given milliseconds later is changed by GABAergic and glutamatergic agents. Using this technique previously, we showed more inhibition in the luteal phase relative to the midfollicular menstrual phase, which is consistent with a progesterone effect.","conclusion":"The combined ratios increased significantly from the early follicular phase to the late follicular phase and then decreased again in the luteal phase. These findings demonstrate an excitatory neuronal effect associated with estradiol and confirm our earlier finding of inhibition associated with progesterone."},{"method":"By measuring the slope of the regression of the individual activity-word rate responses in the temporal cortex in normal subjects, we identified a functional asymmetry in the posterior superior temporal sulcus. The response was greater (steeper) on the left. Using the same study design, we identified a steeper activity-word rate response in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus of patients who had recovered single-word auditory comprehension after infarction of the left posterior temporal cortex. This response was significantly different from that observed in both normal subjects and a group of patients with left hemisphere infarcts that spared the posterior temporal cortex.","background":"We investigated the relationship between cerebral activity (measured with positron emission tomography) and word rate in normal subjects and aphasic patients listening to monosyllabic words at rates up to those encountered in normal speech.","conclusion":"The results demonstrated a change in physiological responsiveness in the contralateral homotopic cortex after posterior temporal infarction."},{"method":"The sequencing of IGHMBP2, the human homologue of the mouse neuromuscular degeneration gene (nmd) that accounts for spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress, failed to detect any mutation in our chronic distal spinal muscular atrophy patients,","background":"Distal spinal muscular atrophy is a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders caused by progressive anterior horn cell degeneration and characterized by progressive motor weakness and muscular atrophy, predominantly in the distal parts of the limbs. Here we report on chronic autosomal recessive distal spinal muscular atrophy in a large, inbred family with onset at various ages. Because this condition had some of the same clinical features as spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress, we tested the disease gene for linkage to chromosome 11q and mapped the disease locus to chromosome 11q13 in the genetic interval that included the spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress gene (D11S1889-D11S1321, Z(max) = 4.59 at theta = 0 at locus D11S4136).","conclusion":"suggesting that spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress and chronic distal spinal muscular atrophy are caused by distinct genes located in the same chromosomal region.

Using phosphorylation-dependent anti-tau antibodies, we show that major tau phosphoepitopes are present in sarcosyl-insoluble gray and white matter regions of Pick's disease brains. Also, for the first time to our knowledge, we demonstrated that isoforms with four microtubule-binding repeat tau isoforms are present in Pick bodies from selected brains.

Patients with hypoperfused at-risk tissue were identified by acute perfusion-diffusion lesion mismatch. As a substudy, acute and subacute magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed in the 33 most recent patients to assess the relationship between acute blood glucose and lactate production in the ischemic region.","background":"Controversy exists whether acute hyperglycemia is causally associated with worse stroke outcome or simply reflects a more severe stroke. In reversible ischemia models, hyperglycemia is associated with lactic acidosis and conversion of penumbral tissue to infarction. However, the relationship between hyperglycemia, lactic acidosis, and stroke outcome has not been explored in humans.","conclusion":"In 40 of 63 patients with acute perfusion-diffusion mismatch, acute hyperglycemia was correlated with reduced salvage of mismatch tissue from infarction, greater final infarct size, and worse functional outcome. These correlations were independent of baseline stroke severity, lesion size, and diabetic status. Furthermore, higher acute blood glucose in patients with perfusion-diffusion mismatch was associated with greater acute-subacute lactate production, which, in turn, was independently associated with reduced salvage of mismatch tissue. In contrast, acute blood glucose levels in nonmismatch patients did not independently correlate with outcome measures, nor was there any acute-subacute increase in lactate in this group. Acute hyperglycemia increases brain lactate production and facilitates conversion of hypoperfused at-risk tissue into infarction, which may adversely affect stroke outcome. These findings support the need for randomized controlled trials of aggressive glycemic control in acute stroke."},{"method":"We now report that minocycline administered either immediately before or immediately after a hypoxic-ischemic insult substantially blocks tissue damage in a rodent model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.

This grip force upregulation normalized with chronic deep-brain stimulation in both conditions (desensitization). Peak-dose dyskinesias also improved, and off-dystonia was completely abolished. Mean dosage of dopaminergic drugs was reduced, but force overflow and dyskinesias were equally improved in 2 patients without a reduction. Despite the same single levodopa test dose, force excess and levodopa-induced dyskinesias were drastically reduced after 3 months of deep-brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus. This indicates that direct effects of deep-brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus on levodopa-induced dyskinesias are likely to occur.

Supporting these conclusions, elevated rat cerebral F(2)-IsoPs and F(4)-NeuroPs after systemic exposure to kainic acid were not associated with a significant change in their plasma or urine levels. These results show that plasma and urine F(2)-IsoPs and F(4)-NeuroPs do not accurately reflect central nervous system levels of these biomarkers and are not reproducibly elevated in body fluids outside of central nervous system in Alzheimer's disease patients.

Pyruvate dehydrogenase is especially vulnerable to inhibition by oxygen free radicals, and the upstream metabolites, pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and 2-phosphoglycerate were elevated in cortical cells after toxic exposure to copper. One approach to protecting pyruvate dehydrogenase from oxidative attack might be to enhance binding to cofactors.

One hour after drug or placebo administration, patients underwent 60-degree head-up tilt lasting 40 minutes (unless hypotension or bradycardia developed first). In the supine position, midodrine produced no significant change in blood pressure or heart rate.","background":"Neurally mediated syncope is the most frequent cause of syncope in patients without structural heart disease. Its most common trigger is a reduction in venous return to the heart due to excessive venous pooling in the legs.","conclusion":"The responses to head-up tilt were significantly different on the midodrine and the placebo day: on the placebo day, 67% (8\/12) of the subjects suffered neurally mediated syncope, whereas only 17% (2\/12) of the subjects developed neurally mediated syncope on the midodrine day (p &lt; 0.02).

In ALS patients and Cu\/Zn-SOD mutant mice, increased oxidative stress occurs in association with the lipid alterations, and exposure of cultured motor neurons to oxidative stress increases the accumulation of sphingomyelin, ceramides, and cholesterol esters.

Genetic, metabolic, and imaging studies ruled out known causes of dystonia. Cognition was subnormal but stable until the last few years. Death occurred at ages 21 and 22 years.","conclusion":"However, the most striking findings were 1) eosinophilic, rod-like cytoplasmic inclusions in neocortical and thalamic neurons that were actin depolymerizing factor\/cofilin-immunoreactive but only rarely actin-positive; and 2) abundant eosinophilic spherical structures in the striatum that were strongly actin- and actin depolymerizing factor\/cofilin-positive. Electron microscopy suggested that these structures represent degenerating neurons and processes; the accumulating filaments had the same dimensions as actin microfilaments. To our knowledge, aggregation of actin has not been reported previously as the predominant feature in any neurodegenerative disease. Thus, our findings may shed light on a novel neuropathological change associated with dystonia that may represent a new degenerative mechanism involving actin, a ubiquitous constituent of the cytoskeletal system."},{"method":"We demonstrate that the purine-rich 19bp element regulates PLP-specific splice site selection in transient transfections of chimeric constructs into cultured oligodendrocytes. Runs of 4 and 5 Gs centered in the 19bp element are critical for efficient PLP-specific splicing. The intronic element is sequence specific in oligodendrocytes and is not a repressor of PLP-specific splicing in nonglial cells.","background":"We report that a deletion of 19 base pairs (bp) in intron 3 of the proteolipid protein (PLP\/DM20) gene causes a neurological disease characterized by mild developmental delay, followed by progressive decline of acquired motor and cognitive milestones. The clinical features are associated with mild delay in myelination demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging studies and with ongoing demyelination and axonal loss demonstrated by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.","conclusion":"These data support the conclusion that deletion of the 19bp purine-rich region in PLP intron 3 causes a reduction in PLP message and protein, which affects myelin stability and axonal integrity."},{"method":"We measured EBV DNA by quantitative PCR and EBV mRNA by RT-PCR in the CSF in patients with EBV-associated neurological disorders.","background":"Acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of the central nervous system (CNS) is associated with meningoencephalitis and other neurological syndromes and with CNS lymphomas (CNSLs). Diagnosis is based on serological studies and more recently on detection of EBV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).","conclusion":"EBV was identified as the cause of CNS infection in 28 patients: 14 with CNSL, 10 with encephalitis, and 4 with postinfectious neurological complications. CSF analysis showed that patients with CNSL had high EBV load (mean +\/- standard error of 4.8 +\/- 0.2 log(10) DNA copies\/ml) and low leukocyte counts (22 +\/- 7 cells\/microl); encephalitis was characterized by high EBV load (4.2 +\/- 0.3 log(10) DNA copies\/ml) and high leukocyte counts (143 +\/- 62 cells\/microl); and patients with postinfectious complications showed low EBV load (3.0 +\/- 0.2 log(10) DNA copies\/ml) with high leukocyte counts (88 +\/- 57 cells\/microl). Lytic cycle EBV mRNA, a marker of viral replication, was identified in 10 CSF samples from patients with CNSL and encephalitis. These studies demonstrate the utility of quantitative CSF PCR and establish the presence of lytic cycle EBV mRNA in CSF of patients with EBV-associated neurological disease."},{"method":"We (1) evaluated long-term DBS in medial temporal lobe structures in patients with normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and (2) investigated the use of chronic DBS electrodes for the localization of the ictal onset zone before DBS. In three patients with complex partial seizures (CPSs), DBS electrodes were implanted in the amygdalohippocampal region to identify and subsequently stimulate the ictal onset zone. CPSs were compared before and after chronic DBS. Side effects were carefully monitored.","background":"Short-term deep brain stimulation (DBS) recently has been shown to be efficacious in refractory temporal lobe epilepsy.","conclusion":"DBS electrodes yielded high-quality electroencephalogram recordings showing unilateral seizure onset in medial temporal lobe structures. For all patients, unilateral amygdalohippocampal stimulation was performed. After a mean follow-up of 5 months (range, 3-6 months), all patients had a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency. In two patients, antiepileptic drugs could be tapered. None of the patients reported side effects. This open study demonstrates the feasibility of consecutive electroencephalographic recordings and DBS in medial temporal lobe structures using DBS electrodes. These results prompt further studies in a larger patient population to establish the efficacy and safety of chronic DBS as an alternative treatment for refractory temporal lobe epilepsy."},{"method":"We now report clinical and genetic findings in nine additional European families with myoclonus-dystonia syndrome.","background":"Mutations in the gene for epsilon-sarcoglycan (SGCE) have been found to cause myoclonus-dystonia syndrome.","conclusion":"The clinical presentation in 24 affecteds was homogeneous with myoclonus predominantly of neck and upper limbs in 23 of them and dystonia, presenting as cervical dystonia and\/or writer's cramp, in 13 cases. Six novel and one previously known heterozygous SGCE mutations were identified. SGCE deficiency seems to be the common pathogenetic mechanism in myoclonus-dystonia syndrome."},{"method":"Here, we have used magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy in vivo and histopathology postmortem to estimate thalamic neuronal loss in patients with multiple sclerosis.","background":"Multiple sclerosis is still regarded primarily as a disease of the white matter. However, recent evidence suggests that there may be significant involvement of gray matter.","conclusion":"Our results show that neuronal loss in multiple sclerosis can be substantial (30-35% reduction). We conclude that a neurodegenerative pathology may make a major contribution to the genesis of symptoms in multiple sclerosis."},{"method":"Electron microscopic immunohistochemistry showed that the granules corresponded to lysosomes of primitive type.","background":"In CAG repeat diseases, affected neurons possess many cytoplasmic granules immunopositive for expanded polyglutamine stretches.","conclusion":"The results suggest that, in addition to the ubiquitin\/proteasome pathway, mutant proteins with expanded polyglutamine stretches are involved in the lysosomal pathway for protein degradation and that this processing mechanism may serve as a target for a new therapeutic approach to CAG repeat diseases."},{"method":"To test this hypothesis, we compared neuronal response to joint displacement in the supplementary and presupplementary motor areas of two monkeys, before and after the progressive establishment of an 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonian syndrome.","background":"Parkinsonian patients present an impairment of proprioceptor-guided movement that could imply abnormal processing in the frontal mesial cortex.","conclusion":"After MPTP administration, neurons were activated by the passive movement of numerous joints in various directions and no longer simply by one or two joints in one direction. This impairment of the focused selection of proprioceptive inputs, imputable to dopamine depletion, could impede motor planning and thus contribute to akinesia."},{"method":"Sixty-eight patients over the age of 14 years with newly diagnosed seizures and 90 matched controls underwent serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans 3.5 years apart. Using quantitative analysis of serial scans, we determined changes in hippocampal volume, hippocampal T2 relaxometry and total and regional brain volumes.","background":"Intractable epilepsy may be associated with widespread structural cerebral damage. We determined whether structural damage occurs to the hippocampus, cerebellum and neocortex in the first few years following a diagnosis of seizures.","conclusion":"Thirty-four (50%) patients had recurrent unprovoked seizures between baseline and follow-up scans. One patient with pre-existing hippocampal sclerosis (HS) did not develop progressive hippocampal damage. Group analyses found no difference in change in cerebral measures between patients and controls or between patients with and without recurrent seizures. Significant quantitative changes in individuals were largely attributable to pre-existing cerebral lesions or alcohol abuse. Subtle changes detected in individuals over 3.5 years but were not related to a history of overt seizures. Our results show patients with newly diagnosed seizures are not generally at increased risk of seizure-induced structural cerebral damage as detected with MRI. Cerebral damage may occur before the onset of seizures or develop insidiously over a more prolonged period."},{"method":"A point mutation (R5L) was identified in a single progressive supranuclear palsy subject that was not in the other progressive supranuclear palsy subjects or in 96 controls. Functionally, this mutation alters the ability of tau to promote microtubule assembly. Analysis of soluble tau from different brain regions indicates that the mutation does not affect the ratio of tau isoforms synthesized. Aggregated insoluble tau from subcortical regions was predominantly four-repeat tau with no or one amino terminal insert (0N4R and 1N4R). Insoluble tau from cortical regions also contained 1N3R tau.","background":"MAPT, the gene encoding tau, was screened for mutations in 96 progressive supranuclear palsy subjects.","conclusion":"Thus, the R5L mutation causes a progressive supranuclear palsy phenotype, presumably by a gain-of-function mechanism."},{"method":"Anatomical correlations are discussed.","background":"A patient developed a primary position upbeat nystagmus and a left saccadic lateropulsion. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a probable cavernoma at right caudal paramedian medullary level.","conclusion":"Saccadic lateropulsion is attributed to olivocerebellar pathway impairment but usually is described in more rostral medullar lesions. Our case would still support this hypothesis because the lesion could have involved the olivocerebellar pathway at its very caudal level. Upbeat nystagmus could be attributed to impairment of the nucleus intercalatus and\/or cell groups of the paramedian tract."},{"method":"Osteolytic sarcoma cells were implanted into the medullary space of the right femur, followed by a subcutaneous inoculation of a replication-defective herpes simplex virus vector expressing human proenkephalin (vector SHPE) or a lacZ-expressing control vector (vector SHZ).","background":"We examined whether a herpes simplex virus vector that expresses human proenkephalin could be used to attenuate nociception in a model of bone cancer pain in mice.","conclusion":"SHPE-inoculated mice demonstrated a significant, naltrexone-reversible decrease in pain-related behavior assessed during open-field motor activity. These results suggest that gene transfer with an enkephalin-expressing vector may be used to treat pain resulting from cancer in bone."},{"method":"We performed a genomewide search and found significant evidence for linkage to chromosome 7p21.3-p15.1.","background":"We investigated a French family with a new type of autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia that was excluded from all previously identified genes and loci. The patients exhibited a slowly progressive gait and limb ataxia variably associated with akinesia, rigidity, tremor, and hyporeflexia. A mild cognitive impairment also was observed in some cases.","conclusion":"Analysis of key recombinants and haplotype reconstruction traced this novel spinocerebellar ataxia locus to a 24cM interval flanked by D7S2464 and D7S516."},{"method":"We screened for MASS1 mutations in individuals from 48 families with familial febrile seizures and found 25 DNA alterations.","background":"A naturally occurring mutation of the mass1 (monogenic audiogenic seizure-susceptible) gene recently has been reported in the Frings mouse strain, which is prone to audiogenic seizures. The human orthologous gene, MASS1, was mapped to chromosome 5q14, for which we previously have reported significant evidence of linkage to febrile seizures (FEB4).","conclusion":"None of nine missense polymorphic alleles was significantly associated with febrile seizures; however, a nonsense mutation (S2652X) causing a deletion of the C-terminal 126 amino acid residues was identified in one family with febrile and afebrile seizures. Our results suggest that a loss-of-function mutation in MASS1 might be responsible for the seizure phenotypes, though it is not likely that MASS1 contributed to the cause of febrile seizures in most of our families."},{"method":"Subjects included 16 boys with autism (aged 7-11 years), with nonverbal IQ greater than 80, and 15 age- and handedness-matched controls. Magnetic resonance brain images were segmented into gray and white matter; cerebral cortex was parcellated into 48 gyral-based divisions per hemisphere. Asymmetry was assessed a priori in language-related inferior lateral frontal and posterior superior temporal regions and assessed post hoc in all regions to determine specificity of asymmetry abnormalities.","background":"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting cognitive, language, and social functioning. Although language and social communication abnormalities are characteristic, prior structural imaging studies have not examined language-related cortex in autistic and control subjects.","conclusion":"Boys with autism had significant asymmetry reversal in frontal language-related cortex: 27% larger on the right in autism and 17% larger on the left in controls. Only one additional region had significant asymmetry differences on post hoc analysis: posterior temporal fusiform gyrus (more left-sided in autism), whereas adjacent fusiform gyrus and temporooccipital inferior temporal gyrus both approached significance (more right-sided in autism). These inferior temporal regions are involved in visual face processing. In boys with autism, language and social\/face processing-related regions displayed abnormal asymmetry. These structural abnormalities may relate to language and social disturbances observed in autism."},{"method":"We report that two novel synthetic inhibitors of the tumor suppressor protein p53, pifithrin-alpha (PFT-alpha) and Z-1-117, are highly effective in protecting midbrain dopaminergic neurons and improving behavioral outcome in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Mice given intraperitoneal injections of PFT-alpha or Z-1-117 exhibited improved motor function, reduced damage to nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and reduced depletion of dopamine and its metabolites after exposure to the toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). MPTP caused an increase in the level of the proapoptotic protein Bax, which was prevented by giving mice PFT-alpha and Z-1-117. PFT-alpha and Z-1-117 also suppressed Bax production and apoptosis in cultured dopaminergic cells exposed to MPP(+).","background":"Drugs currently used for patients with Parkinson's disease provide temporary relief of symptoms but do not halt or slow the underlying neurodegenerative disease process. Increasing evidence suggests that neurons die in Parkinson's disease by a process called apoptosis, which may be triggered by mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress.","conclusion":"Our findings demonstrate a pivotal role for p53 in experimental parkinsonism and identify a novel class of synthetic p53 inhibitors with clinical potential."},{"method":"Functional MRI was used to study 11 patients with chronic hemiplegia after unilateral stroke that spared regions of motor cortex. Activation in stroke-affected hemisphere was evaluated using 3 probes independent of affected corticospinal tract: passive finger movement, a hand-related visuomotor stimulus, and tapping by the nonstroke index finger. The site and magnitude of cortical activation were similar when comparing the stroke hemisphere to findings in 19 control subjects.","background":"Many central nervous system conditions that cause weakness, including many strokes, injure corticospinal tract but leave motor cortex intact. Little is known about the functional properties of surviving cortical regions in this setting, in part because many studies have used probes reliant on the corticospinal tract. We hypothesized that many features of motor cortex function would be preserved when assessed independent of the stroke-affected corticospinal tract.","conclusion":"Patients activated each of 8 cortical regions with similar frequency as compared to controls, generally with a smaller activation volume. In some cases, clinical measures correlated with the size or the site of stroke hemisphere activation. The results suggest that, despite stroke producing contralateral hemiplegia, surviving regions of motor cortex actively participate in the same proprioceptive, visuomotor, and bilateral movement control processes seen in control subjects."},{"method":"Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy transgenic mice showed an increased number of affected glias with increasing age and with larger expansions of CAG repeats.","background":"White matter degeneration is one of the pathological conditions of dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. Autopsy brains exhibited a reduced number of glial cells in the lesions and an involvement of oligodendrocytes in nuclear inclusion formation, which previously has been recognized only as a pathological hallmark in neurons.","conclusion":"These findings suggest that glial cells in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy also are involved in the polyglutamine pathogenesis."},{"method":"To overcome this defect, we made a synthetic ND4 subunit compatible with the \"universal\" genetic code and imported it into mitochondria by adding a mitochondrial targeting sequence. For detection we added a FLAG tag. This gene was inserted in an adeno-associated viral vector.","background":"A G to A transition at nucleotide 11778 in the ND4 subunit gene of complex I was the first point mutation in the mitochondrial genome linked to a human disease. It causes Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy, a disorder with oxidative phosphorylation deficiency.","conclusion":"The ND4FLAG protein was imported into the mitochondria of cybrids harboring the G11778A mutation, where it increased their survival rate threefold, under restrictive conditions that forced the cells to rely predominantly on oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP. Since assays of complex I activity were normal in G11778A cybrids we focused on changes in ATP synthesis using complex I substrates. The G11778A cybrids showed a 60% reduction in the rate of ATP synthesis. Relative to mock-transfected G11778A cybrids, complemented G11778A cybrids showed a threefold increase in ATP synthesis, to a level indistinguishable from that in cybrids containing normal mitochondrial DNA. Restoration of respiration by allotopic expression opens the door for gene therapy of Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy."},{"method":"Mice underwent 30 or 90 minutes of intraluminal middle cerebral artery thread occlusion. TAT-Bcl-X(L), TAT-beta-galactosidase, or TAT-GFP (0.6 nmol each) were applied intravenously over 10 minutes either 1 hour before or immediately after ischemia. Additional animals received no TAT protein infusions.","background":"The delivery of proteins across the blood-brain barrier is severely limited by the proteins' size and biochemical properties. Eleven-amino acid human immunodeficiency virus TAT protein is able to cross cell membranes even when coupled with larger peptides. We evaluated whether TAT-Bcl-X(L) fusion protein is protective in focal ischemia.","conclusion":"We show that the brain tissue is progressively transduced with TAT proteins within 3 to 4 hours after intravenous delivery. We provide evidence that TAT-Bcl-X(L) treatment reduces infarct volume and neurological deficits after long ischemic insults lasting 90 minutes, when applied both before and after ischemia. After short insults, lasting only 30 minutes, TAT-Bcl-X(L) further diminishes the number of caspase-3-reactive and DNA fragmented cells and increases the number of viable neurons in the striatum. Our results indicate that TAT fusion proteins are elegant and powerful tools that might be of clinical interest for stroke treatment, because factors may be intravenously applied. Thus, fusion proteins may open fascinating perspectives for future research."},{"method":"We investigated the in situ properties of muscle mitochondria in patients with early-stage SALS and sedentary (SED) controls using the skinned fiber technique to determine whether respiration of muscle tissue is altered in early-stage SALS in comparison with SED. Musculus vastus lateralis biopsies were obtained from 7 SED group members and 14 patients with early-stage SALS (mean disease duration, 9 months). Muscle fibers were permeabilized with saponine and then skinned and placed in an oxygraphic chamber to measure basal (V(0)) and maximal (V(max)) adenosine diphosphate-stimulated respiration rates and to assess mitochondrial regulation by adenosine diphosphate.","background":"Evidence implicating mitochondrial dysfunction in the central nervous system of patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SALS) has recently been accumulating. In contrast, data on mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle in SALS are scarce and controversial.","conclusion":"Muscle oxidative capacity, evaluated with V(max), was identical in patients in the SALS and SED groups (V(0): SALS, 1.1 +\/- 0.1; SED, 0.8 +\/- 0.1, micromol 0(2). min(-1). gm(-1)dw and V(max): SALS, 3.1 +\/- 0.3; SED, 2.5 +\/- 0.3, micromol 0(2). min(-1). gm(-1)dw). This study shows an absence of large mitochondrial damage in skeletal muscle of patients with early-stage SALS, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction in the earlier stages of SALS is almost certainly not systemic."},{"method":"Twenty hippocampal specimens were obtained during temporal lobectomy and frozen quickly. Perchloric acid extracts of the small metabolites were analyzed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.","background":"Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by hippocampal atrophy, hypometabolism, and decreased N-acetylaspartate, often attributed to neuron loss and gliosis.","conclusion":"There were no significant associations between hippocampal neuron loss and the cellular content of N-acetylaspartate, glutamate, GABA, glutamine, or aspartate. The mean metabolite content of hippocampi with less than 30% of neurons remaining was the same as those with greater than 65% of neurons surviving. Mean N-acetylaspartate levels were below those reported by in vivo studies of control subjects. The highest and the lowest glutamate concentrations were seen in specimens with the worst neuron loss. A highly significant association between hippocampal N-acetylaspartate and glutamate content was seen with weak associations between N-acetylaspartate and aspartate and glutamate and aspartate. The hippocampal content of N-acetylaspartate, glutamate, GABA, glutamine, and aspartate is altered minimally by severe neuron loss in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. The epileptic human hippocampus has increased intracellular glutamate content that may contribute to the epileptogenic nature of hippocampal sclerosis."},{"method":"To elucidate the role of these 14-3-3 proteins in patients with multiple system atrophy, we performed immunohistochemical studies on 14-3-3 in brain tissue specimens from 7 control subjects and from 15 patients with multiple system atrophy.","background":"Glial cytoplasmic inclusions are the pathological hallmark of multiple system atrophy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of glial cytoplasmic inclusions remain unclear. Alpha-synuclein, a major component of glial cytoplasmic inclusions, has the ability to interact with 14-3-3 proteins, which mediate several types of signal transduction pathways.","conclusion":"In both control and multiple system atrophy cases, 14-3-3 immunoreactivity was observed mainly in the neuronal somata and proximal processes, as well as the nerve fibers. Even in the severely affected regions of patients with multiple system atrophy, 14-3-3 immunoreactivity generally was spared in the surviving neurons, some of which were strongly immunolabeled. In addition, numerous glial cytoplasmic inclusions were intensely immunostained, and neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions and dystrophic neurites were also immunoreactive for 14-3-3. Our results suggest that an aberrant accumulation of 14-3-3 proteins may occur in brains affected by multiple system atrophy, and that 14-3-3 proteins may be associated with the pathogenesis of multiple system atrophy."},{"method":"In this study, we examined sodium channel mRNA and protein expression in dorsal root ganglion neurons in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and tactile allodynia, using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry for sodium channels Na(v)1.1, Na(v)1.3, Na(v)1.6, Na(v)1.7, Na(v)1.8, and Na(v)1.9.","background":"Although pain is experienced by many patients with diabetic neuropathy, the pathophysiology of painful diabetic neuropathy is not understood. Substantial evidence indicates that dysregulated sodium channel gene transcription contributes to hyperexcitability of dorsal root ganglion neurons, which may produce neuropathic pain after axonal transection.","conclusion":"Our results show that, in rats with experimental diabetes, there is a significant upregulation of mRNA for the Na(v)1.3, Na(v)1.6, and Na(v)1.9 sodium channels and a downregulation of Na(v)1.8 mRNA 1 and 8 weeks after onset of allodynia. Channel protein levels display parallel changes. Our results demonstrate dysregulated expression of the genes for sodium channels Na(v)1.3, Na(v)1.6, Na(v)1.8, and Na(v)1.9 in dorsal root ganglion neurons in experimental diabetes and suggest that misexpression of sodium channels contributes to neuropathic pain associated with diabetic neuropathy."},{"method":"To elucidate the pathogenesis of transient neonatal hyperglycinemia, we studied three patients by screening mutations in the genes that encode three components of the glycine cleavage system.","background":"Transient neonatal hyperglycinemia is clinically or biochemically indistinguishable from nonketotic hyperglycinemia at onset. In the case of transient neonatal hyperglycinemia, the elevated plasma and cerebrospinal fluid glycine levels are normalized within 2 to 8 weeks.","conclusion":"Heterozygous mutations were identified in all of the three patients, suggesting that transient neonatal hyperglycinemia develops in some heterozygous carriers for nonketotic hyperglycinemia."},{"method":"We present the first case of a novel SOD-1 mutation in a patient with genetically proven sporadic ALS.","background":"Mutations in the Cu\/Zn superoxide dismutase gene (SOD-1) are reported in 20% of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases, but no definite report of a mutation in a \"truly\" sporadic case of ALS has been proved.","conclusion":"This mutation (H80A) is believed to alter zinc ligand binding, and its functional significance correlates well with the aggressive clinical course and postmortem findings observed in this patient."},{"method":"Using a three-dimensional turntable, we analyzed the influence of gravity on these two mechanisms. Patients with cerebellar downbeat nystagmus (n = 6) and healthy subjects (n = 12) were placed in various whole-body positions along the roll, pitch, and oblique vertical planes of the head. Ocular drift was monitored with scleral search coils.","background":"Downbeat nystagmus is a frequent ocular motor sign in patients with lesions of the vestibulocerebellum. The upward drift in downbeat nystagmus is a combination of a gaze-evoked drift, due to an impaired vertical neural integrator, and a velocity bias.","conclusion":"Although there was no gravity dependence of the vertical gaze-evoked drift, the vertical velocity bias consisted of two components: a gravity-dependent component that sinusoidally modulated as a function of body position along the pitch plane, and a gravity-independent component that was directed upward. The combination of the two components led to an overall drift that was minimal in supine and maximal in prone position. In healthy subjects, only the gravity-dependent component was present, but in a scaled-down manner. Our results suggest that the intact vestibulocerebellum minimizes an overacting otolith-ocular reflex elicited by pitch tilt and cancels an inherent upward ocular drift that is independent of gravity-modulated otolith signals."},{"method":"Muscle biochemistry showed succinate:cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex II-III) deficiency. Both clinical and biochemical abnormalities improved remarkably with coenzyme Q10 supplementation. Clinically, when taking 300mg coenzyme Q10 per day, she resumed walking, gained weight, underwent puberty, and grew 20cm between 24 and 29 years of age. Coenzyme Q10 was markedly decreased in cerebrospinal fluid, muscle, lymphoblasts, and fibroblasts, suggesting the diagnosis of primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency.","background":"A 31-year-old woman had encephalopathy, growth retardation, infantilism, ataxia, deafness, lactic acidosis, and increased signals of caudate and putamen on brain magnetic resonance imaging.","conclusion":"An older sister has similar clinical course and biochemical abnormalities. These findings suggest that coenzyme Q10 deficiency can present as adult Leigh's syndrome."},{"method":"A novel method using two-dimensional J-resolved magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that GABA levels in the human sensorimotor cortex are quickly reduced within minutes of deafferentation.","background":"Recovery of function after acute injury to the central nervous system may be controlled by the availability of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the cerebral cortex. Acute lesions as well as manipulation of sensory inputs can lead to rapid reorganization of the cerebral cortex, occurring within minutes to hours. Reduction of cortical inhibitory tone through a decrease in the availability of GABA has been suggested as a possible mechanism; however, the degree and temporal course of the changes in brain GABA are not known.","conclusion":"This finding strongly supports the view that the release of latent corticocortical projections from tonic inhibition through decreased GABA availability is a mechanism of rapid cortical plasticity. Reduction of brain GABA can play a pivotal role in regulating the extent of rapid cortical reorganization after lesions or changes in sensory input."},{"method":"In the mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis VII, we found that specific regions of the brain are vulnerable to neurodegeneration, characterized by the presence of ubiquitin inclusions, neurofilament inclusions, and reactive astrogliosis.","background":"The mucopolysaccharidoses are caused by inherited deficiencies of lysosomal enzymes involved in the degradative pathway of glycosaminoglycans. Lysosomal storage leads to cellular and organ dysfunction, including mental retardation.

Among the eight patients with early diffusion imaging reversal, late secondary injury by day 7 occurred in 5 (63%), and sustained normalization of all reversed tissue occurred in 3 (38%). Pretreatment apparent diffusion coefficient values were lowest in regions experiencing no reversal (mean apparent diffusion coefficient, 608 microm(2)\/sec), intermediate in regions with reversal and secondary decline (617 microm(2)\/sec), and highest in regions with sustained reversal (663 microm(2)\/sec).

Our results suggest that higher intake of dairy products may increase the risk of PD in men; however, this finding needs further evaluation, and the underlying active components need to be identified."},{"method":"The diagnosis was based on the neuropathological finding of a diffuse accumulation of Rosenthal fibers within the brain and the spinal cord.","background":"We present a juvenile case of Alexander's disease with atypical focal magnetic resonance imaging-detected lesions and elevated levels of lactate in cerebrospinal fluid.","conclusion":"The diagnosis was confirmed by detection of a mutation in exon 1 at nucleotide position 249 of glial fibrillary acidic protein cDNA, a finding previously reported in cases of infantile Alexander's disease."},{"method":"we present magnetic resonance images visualizing focal laminar cortical lesions around a fissure or sulcus in two patients, who initially did not undergo surgery, with delayed ischemic neurological deficits.","background":"In the autopsy studies of patients with delayed ischemic neurological deficits after subarachnoid hemorrhage, a predominance of cortical lesions has been observed.

VBM demonstrated reduced gray matter in left superior temporal and inferior parietal regions in the PPA group. However, these patients showed a normal pattern of activation within the classical language regions. In addition, PPA patients showed activations, not seen in normals, in fusiform gyrus, precentral gyrus, and intra-parietal sulcus. These activations were found to correlate negatively with measures of naming and task performance. The additional activations in PPA may therefore represent a compensatory spread of language-related neural activity or a failure to suppress activity in areas normally inhibited during language tasks."},{"method":"Focal stroke was induced in adult rats by 90-minute right middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Cell proliferation and neurogenesis were assessed with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling and immunostaining for cell type-specific markers.","background":"The persistence of neurogenesis in the forebrain subventricular zone (SVZ) of adult mammals suggests that the mature brain maintains the potential for neuronal replacement after injury. We examined whether focal ischemic injury in adult rat would increase SVZ neurogenesis and direct migration and neuronal differentiation of endogenous precursors in damaged regions.","conclusion":"Brains examined 10-21 days after stroke showed markedly increased SVZ neurogenesis and chains of neuroblasts extending from the SVZ to the peri-infarct striatum. Many BrdU-labeled cells persisted in the striatum and cortex adjacent to infarcts, but at 35 days after tMCAO only BrdU-labeled cells in the neostriatum expressed neuronal markers. Newly generated cells in the injured neostriatum expressed markers of medium spiny neurons, which characterize most neostriatal neurons lost after tMCAO. These findings indicate that focal ischemic injury increases SVZ neurogenesis and directs neuroblast migration to sites of damage. Moreover, neuroblasts in the injured neostriatum appear to differentiate into a region-appropriate phenotype, which suggests that the mature brain is capable of replacing some neurons lost after ischemic injury."},{"method":"Functional magnetic resonance imaging showed that motion and color-change stimuli presented to the hemianopic field produced activation in several extrastriate areas of the lesioned hemisphere that were defined using retinotopic mapping. Magnetoencephalographic recordings indicated that evoked activity occurred earlier in the higher-tier visual areas V4\/V8 and V5 than in the lower-tier areas V2\/V3 adjacent to the lesion. In addition, the functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis showed an increased functional connectivity between areas V4\/V8 and V5 of the lesioned hemisphere in comparison with the same areas in the intact hemisphere during the presentation of color changes.","background":"This study investigated the neural substrates of preserved visual functioning in a patient with homonymous hemianopsia and Riddoch syndrome after a posterior cerebral artery stroke affecting the primary visual cortex (area V1). The limited visual abilities of this patient included above-chance verbal reports of movement and color change as well as discrimination of movement direction in the hemianopic field.","conclusion":"These results suggest that visual perception after the V1 lesion in Riddoch syndrome is mediated by subcortical pathways that bypass V1 and project first to higher-tier visual areas V5 and V4\/V8 and subsequently to lower-tier areas V2\/V3."},{"method":"Transfer of PTEN to human glioma cells resulted in the transduction of a functional PTEN protein as evidenced by the upregulation of p27 and modification of the phosphorylation status of Akt. Under normoxic conditions, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Northern blot analyses showed downregulation of VEGF in PTEN-treated cells. Moreover, conditioned media from PTEN-treated glioma cells significantly diminished the ability of endothelial cells to grow and migrate. Western blot assays demonstrated that, in a normoxic environment, PTEN downregulates HIF-1 alpha. Finally, promoter activity assays showed that the VEGF promoter region containing the HIF-1alpha binding site is necessary and sufficient for PTEN-mediated downregulation of VEGF. Experiments with PI3-K inhibitors and kinase assays suggested that PI3-K is mediating the effect of PTEN on VEGF, and not the p42\/p48 or p38 MAP kinases.","background":"Inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN and overexpression of VEGF are two of the most common events observed in high-grade malignant gliomas. The purpose of this study was to determine whether PTEN controls VEGF expression in gliomas under normoxic conditions.","conclusion":"These results indicate that restoration of PTEN function in gliomas may induce therapeutic effect by downregulating VEGF. Furthermore, this close functional relationship between PTEN and VEGF suggests that a better understanding of the transduction signal regulated by PTEN might enhance the knowledge of the cause and physiology of vascular and inflammatory diseases."},{"method":"We report that environmental enrichment reverses long-term deficits in spatial learning produced by developmental Pb2+ exposure in rats. Enhanced learning performance of Pb2+-exposed animals reared in an enriched environment was associated with recovery of deficits in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 1 (NR1) mRNA and induction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA in the hippocampus. The effect of environmental enrichment on NR1 and BDNF gene expression was specific to Pb2+-exposed animals and was present in the absence of changes in the NR2B subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, GluR1, alpha CamKII, or PSD-95 gene expression measured in the same animals.","background":"Long-term deficits in cognitive function are the principal effects of lead (Pb2+) exposure in children and can be modeled in experimental animals. Current therapeutic approaches in the treatment of childhood Pb2+ intoxication are not effective in reversing learning deficits once they have occurred.","conclusion":"Our findings demonstrate that the learning impairments and NR1 subunit mRNA deficits resulting from developmental Pb2+ exposure are reversible if the animals are provided with an enriched environment even after the exposure has occurred.

This painful neuropathy not only affects the quality of life of human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients but also severely limits viral suppression strategies.","conclusion":"We show that among the dideoxynucleosides, ddC appears to be the most neurotoxic, followed by ddI and then d4T. This reflects their potency in causing neuropathy. AZT, which does not cause a peripheral neuropathy in patients, does not cause significant neurotoxicity in our model. Furthermore, in this model, we show that the immunophilin ligand FK506 but not cyclosporin A prevents the development of neurotoxicity by ddC, as judged by amelioration of ddC-induced \"neuritic pruning,\" neuronal mitochondrial depolarization, and neuronal necrotic death. This finding suggests a calcineurin-independent mechanism of neuroprotection. As calcineurin inhibition underlies the immunosuppressive properties of these clinically used immunophilin ligands, this holds promise for the neuroprotective efficacy of nonimmunosuppressive analogs of FK506 in the prevention or treatment of antiretroviral toxic neuropathy."},{"method":"Our objective was to determine whether SHC combined with mild total-body hypothermia while anesthetized for a period of 24 hours reduces cerebral damage in our piglet survival model of global hypoxia-ischemia. Eighteen anesthetized piglets received a 45-minute global hypoxic-ischemic insult. The pigs were randomized either to remain normothermic or to receive SHC.","background":"Hypothermia is potentially therapeutic in the management of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. However, not all studies have shown a neuroprotective effect. It is suggested that the stress of unsedated hypothermia may interfere with neuroprotection. We propose that selective head cooling (SHC) combined with mild total-body hypothermia during anesthesia enhances local neuroprotection while minimizing the occurrence of systemic side effects and stress associated with unsedated whole-body cooling.","conclusion":"We found that the severity of the hypoxic-ischemic insult was similar in the SHC versus the normothermic group, and that the mean neurology scores at 30 and 48 hours and neuropathology scores were significantly better in the SHC group versus the normothermic group. We conclude that selective head cooling combined with mild systemic hypothermia and anesthesia is neuroprotective when started immediately after the insult in our piglet model of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy."},{"method":"We report an infant boy with lethal congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy and WS4 who had a heterozygous SOX10 mutation (Q250X).

In contrast with the SOX10 loss-of-function mutations causing only WS4, mutations associated with both peripheral and central dysmyelination may affect pathology through a dominant-negative mechanism."},{"method":"We have looked for correlations between genetic losses and clinical evolution in 34 oligoastrocytomas. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) with different microsatellite markers was studied on chromosomes 1p, 10q, 17p, and 19q. LOH on 1p was found in 44% of the tumors, on 10q in 24%, on 17p in 18%, and on 19q in 38%. LOH on 1p and 19q was combined in 29% of the patients.","background":"Oligoastrocytomas are mixed gliomas harboring different genetic alterations and with heterogeneous clinical evolution.","conclusion":"LOH on 1p was associated with significantly longer overall survival (p = 0.0092) and LOH on 10q with shorter overall survival (p = 0.0206). The observation that LOH on 10q predicts a short survival in oligoastrocytomas is novel and provides further evidence that genetic analysis may help to predict the clinical evolution of different gliomas, giving a more rationale basis to therapeutic options."},{"method":"Many clinical trials previously performed with a variety of neuroprotective and thrombolytic drugs provide many lessons that will help to guide future acute stroke therapy trials and enhance the likelihood of success in future trials.","background":"The development of additional acute stroke therapies to complement and supplement intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator within the first 3 hours after stroke onset remains an important and pressing need. Much has been learned about the presumed target of acute stroke therapy, the ischemic penumbra, and clinically available imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography hold great promise for at least partially identifying this region of potentially salvageable ischemic tissue. Understanding the biology of ischemia-related cell injury has also evolved rapidly. New treatment approaches to improve outcome after focal brain ischemia will likely be derived by looking at naturally occurring adaptive mechanisms such as those related to ischemic preconditioning and hibernation.","conclusion":"Combining knowledge from these three areas provides optimism that additional acute stroke therapies can be developed to maximize beneficial functional outcome in the greatest proportion of acute stroke patients possible."},{"method":"Male rats were injected with two doses of streptozocin (40 mg\/kg IP) on 2 consecutive days to induce diabetic hyperglycemia. Controls either received vehicle or were not injected. After 2 weeks, blood glucose concentration was measured, and the rats were subjected to flurothyl seizure test. Another group of rats received glucose solution (20%, 5 ml IP) 30 minutes before testing to induce nondiabetic hyperglycemia. Thresholds for flurothyl-induced clonic and tonic-clonic seizures were determined. Finally, in vitro epileptiform activity was induced in the entorhinal cortex-hippocampal slices from naive rats by perfusing with magnesium-free medium with various glucose concentrations. In additional slices, paired-pulse paradigm was determined in the perforant path.","background":"In adult diabetic patients, periods of hyperglycemia may be associated with exacerbation of focal seizures. Our objective was to determine in the adult rats the correlation between seizure susceptibility and extracellular glucose concentration in two models of seizures.","conclusion":"Susceptibility to clonic and tonic-clonic flurothyl-induced seizures positively correlated with blood glucose concentrations as the increased glucose concentration was associated with proconvulsant effects. Similarly, in the in vitro experiments, epileptiform activity was promoted by increased and suppressed by decreased glucose concentrations. Data indicate that, in the adult rats, high glucose concentrations are associated with proconvulsant effects."},{"method":"Cortical motor output to upper limbs was tested via motor-evoked potentials from forearm and hand muscles elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation of motor cortex in 16 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease without motor deficits.","background":"Motor deficits affect patients with Alzheimer's disease only at later stages. Recent studies demonstrate that the primary motor cortex is affected by neuronal degeneration accompanied by the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. It is conceivable that neuronal loss is compensated by reorganization of the neural circuitries occurring along the natural course of the disease, thereby maintaining motor performances in daily living.","conclusion":"Motor cortex excitability was increased, and the center of gravity of motor cortical output, as represented by excitable scalp sites, showed a frontal and medial shift, without correlated changes in the site of maximal excitability (hot-spot). This may indicate functional reorganization, possibly after the neuronal loss in motor areas. Hyperexcitability might be caused by a dysregulation of the intracortical GABAergic inhibitory circuitries and selective alteration of glutamatergic neurotransmission. Such findings suggest that motor cortex hyperexcitability and reorganization allows prolonged preservation of motor function during the clinical course of Alzheimer's disease."},{"method":"We have used (18)F-dopa positron emission tomography to study four patients who are homozygous and three asymptomatic relatives who are heterozygous for PARK6.","background":"PARK6, a locus for early-onset recessive parkinsonism, has been causally implicated in nine unrelated families from four different countries.

The group of asymptomatic PARK6 carriers showed a significant mean 20 to 30% reduction in caudate and putamen (18)F-dopa uptake in comparison with controls, individual values falling toward the bottom of the normal range. Our results indicate that PARK6 pathology results in a more uniform loss of striatal dopamine terminal function than Parkinson's disease. The subclinical loss of striatal dopamine storage capacity found in the PARK6 carriers implies that the unidentified gene on the short arm of chromosome 1 exhibits either haploinsufficency or a dominant negative effect."},{"method":"In this study, we quantified the activity of this network in carriers of other dystonia mutations to determine whether this functional abnormality is linked to genotype.","background":"The DYT1 dystonia mutation is associated with an abnormal metabolic brain network characterized by hypermetabolism of the basal ganglia, supplementary motor area, and the cerebellum.","conclusion":"The findings suggest that the DYT1 metabolic topography is not genotype specific and may be present in carriers of other dystonia mutations."},{"method":"We have determined mitochondrial ATP, phosphocreatine, and intracellular inorganic phosphate levels by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the heart of 11 Friedreich's ataxia patients and 11 healthy controls.","background":"Friedreich's ataxia is a neurodegenerative disease frequently associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.","conclusion":"For the first time, to our knowledge, we showed a significant correlation between the extent of myocardial energy deficiency and the degree of myocardial hypertrophy.

We assessed volumes and atrophy rates of brain structures in patients with familial AD during the period that they developed symptoms.","conclusion":"There were no significant differences in baseline measures of whole brain, temporal lobe, or ventricular volume between patients and controls; averaged volumes of medial temporal lobe structures (both hippocampi and ECs) were 16.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3-28.0%) lower in patients. Atrophy rates for brain, temporal lobe, hippocampus, and EC were significantly increased in patients compared with controls (p &lt; 0.05). Averaged atrophy rates from both hippocampi and ECs were 5.1% (95% CI, 3.0-7.1%) greater in patients than controls. Linear extrapolation backward suggested medial temporal lobe atrophy commenced 3.5 years (95% CI, 0.7-7.5 years) before onset, when all patients were asymptomatic. We conclude that increased medial temporal lobe atrophy rates are an early and distinguishing feature of AD and that pathological atrophy probably is occurring several years before the onset of symptoms."},{"method":"Using a ribozyme designed to degrade the mRNA encoding a critical nuclear-encoded subunit gene of complex I (NDUFA1), we tested whether oxidative phosphorylation deficiency can recapitulate the optic neuropathy of mitochondrial disease.","background":"Optic nerve degeneration is a feature common to diseases with mutations in genes that encode complex I of the respiratory chain.

This indicates a compensatory neuronal plasticity that we now show to involve the nigropallidal dopamine pathway to the GPi but not to the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe). Enhanced function of the dopamine projection to the GPi serves, we propose, to maintain a more normal pattern of pallidal output to ventral thalamus and motor cortex in early PD, whereas loss of this adaptive pathway in advanced disease may be a pivotal step in the progression of the disease."},{"method":"We examined the relationship between homocysteine and cognitive decline in 1,241 subjects aged 61 to 73 years, followed up over 4 years.

Mutations of PLP1\/DM20 cause Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease (PMD), a leukodystrophy, and in some instances, a peripheral neuropathy.","conclusion":"As shown previously, all patients with PLP1 null mutations had peripheral neuropathy. We also identified 4 new PLP1 point mutations that cause both PMD and peripheral neuropathy, three of which truncate PLP1 expression within the PLP1-specific domain, but do not alter DM20. The fourth, a splicing mutation, alters both PLP1 and DM20, and is probably a null mutation. Six PLP1 point mutations predicted to produce proteins with an intact PLP1-specific domain do not cause peripheral neuropathy. Sixty-one individuals with PLP1 duplications also had normal peripheral nerve function. These data demonstrate that expression of PLP1 but not DMSO is necessary to prevent neuropathy, and suggest that the 35 amino acid PLP1-specific domain plays an important role in normal peripheral nerve function."},{"method":"Here we investigate the growing body of evidence demonstrating the ability of &#x3b1;syn to spread transcellularly and induce pathological aggregation affecting neurons by permissive templating and provide a critical analysis of some irregularities in the hypothesis that the progression of PD pathology may be mediated by such a prion-like process.","background":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder typified by the presence of intraneuronal inclusions containing aggregated alpha synuclein (&#x3b1;syn).

During that time researchers have acquired an enormous amount of data and have been successful, more than 300 times, in curing the disease in animal model systems by treatments aimed at clearing amyloid deposits. However, to date similar strategies have not been successful in human AD patients. Hence, before rushing into further clinical trials with compounds that aim at lowering amyloid-beta (A&#x3b2;) levels in increasingly younger people, it would be of highest priority to re-assess the initial assumption that accumulation of A&#x3b2; in the brain is the primary pathological event driving AD.","conclusion":"In AD, this protective program may be overridden by genetic and other risk factors, or its maintenance may become dysregulated during aging.

Unlike the evidence supporting a role for NOTCH receptors in MB development, the pathological functions of NOTCH ligands remain largely unexplored.","conclusion":"The research revealed a significant over-expression of ligand JAG1 in the vast majority of MBs, and proved that JAG1 mediates pro-proliferative signals via activation of NOTCH2 receptor and induction of HES1 expression, thus representing an attractive therapeutic target. Furthermore, we could identify a clinically relevant association between ligand JAG2 and the oncogene MYC, specific for MYC-driven Group 3 MB cases. We describe for the first time a mechanistic link between the oncogene MYC and NOTCH pathway in MB, by identifying JAG2 as MYC target, and by showing that MB cells acquire induced expression of JAG2 through MYC-induced transcriptional activation.

Severe hemorrhages, edema and neutrophilic inflammation in the absence of circumscribed perivascular demyelination affected the temporal neocortex and white matter, hippocampus, cerebellar cortex and white matter, optic chiasm, mammillary bodies, brainstem, cranial nerve roots and leptomeninges. Perivascular end-feet and parenchymal processes of astrocytes exhibited impressive swelling in haemorrhagic but non-demyelinated white matter regions. Astrocytes were dystrophic and displayed degenerating processes. Astrocytic swellings and remnants were immunoreactive for aquaporin-4, aquaporin-1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein.","background":"Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHL) is a fulminant demyelinating disease of unknown etiology. Most cases are fatal within one week from onset. AHL pathology varies with the acuteness of disease. Hemorrhages, vessel fibrinoid necrosis, perivascular fibrin exudation, edema and neutrophilic inflammation are early features, while perivascular demyelination, microglial foci and myelin-laden macrophages appear later. Reactive astrocytosis is not present in early hemorrhagic non-demyelinated lesions, but is seen in older lesions.","conclusion":"These morphological changes of astrocytes consistent with injury were also observed in haemorrhagic and normal appearing cortex. Our findings reinforce that perivascular demyelination is not present early in AHL. This is the first study that highlights the early and widespread astrocytic injury in the absence of demyelination in AHL, suggesting that, similarly to neuromyelitis optica and central pontine myelinolysis, demyelination in AHL is secondary to astrocyte injury."},{"method":"To define the epitope recognized by C4F6, we tested its binding to a panel of recombinant ALS-SOD1 proteins expressed in cultured cells, producing data to suggest that the C4F6 epitope minimally contains amino acids 90-93, which are normally folded into a tight hairpin loop. Multiple van der Waals interactions between the 90-93 loop and a loop formed by amino acids 37-42, particularly a leucine at position 38, form a stable structure termed the &#x3b2;-plug. Based on published modeling predictions, we suggest that the binding of C4F6 to multiple ALS mutants of SOD1 occurs when the local structure within the &#x3b2;-plug, including the loop at 90-93, is destabilized.

Attempts to determine whether non-mutant SOD1 adopts a C4F6-reactive conformation in spinal tissues of sporadic ALS (sALS) patients has produced inconsistent results.","conclusion":"Using conditions that showed the best discrimination between normal and misfolded mutant SOD1 in cell and mouse models, we could find no obvious difference in C4F6 reactivity to spinal motor neurons between sALS and controls tissues."},{"method":"The present study examined the similarities of tau APFs with other tau amyloid species and showed for the first time the presence of tau APFs in brain tissue from patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), as well as in the P301L mouse model, which overexpresses mutated tau.","background":"Pathological aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau and subsequent accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) or other tau-containing inclusions are defining histopathological features of many neurodegenerative diseases, which are collectively known as tauopathies. Due to conflicting results regarding a correlation between the presence of NFTs and disease progression, the mechanism linking pathological tau aggregation with cell death is poorly understood. An emerging view is that NFTs are not the toxic entity in tauopathies; rather, tau intermediates between monomers and NFTs are pathogenic. Several proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as &#x3b2;-amyloid (A&#x3b2;) and &#x3b1;-synuclein, have the tendency to form pore-like amyloid structures (annular protofibrils, APFs) that mimic the membrane-disrupting properties of pore-forming protein toxins.","conclusion":"Furthermore, we found that APFs are preceded by tau oligomers and do not go on to form NFTs, evading fibrillar fate.

However, there is little evidence that NFTs directly impact physiological properties of host neurons.","conclusion":"We demonstrate in vivo that visual cortex neurons with tangles are as likely to express comparable amounts of Arc in response to structured visual stimulation as their neighbors without tangles. Probability of experience-dependent Arc response was not affected by tau tangles in both visual cortex and hippocampal pyramidal neurons as determined postmortem. Moreover, whole brain analysis showed that network-wide activity-driven Arc expression was not affected by tau pathology in any of the brain regions, including brain areas with the highest tangle load.

These mice (db\/AD) retain many features of the parental lines (e.g. extreme obesity, diabetes, and parenchymal deposition of &#x3b2;-amyloid (A&#x3b2;)). The combination of the two diseases led to additional pathologies-perhaps most striking of which was the presence of severe cerebrovascular pathology, including aneurysms and small strokes. Cortical A&#x3b2; deposition was not significantly increased in the diabetic mice, though overall expression of presenilin was elevated. Surprisingly, A&#x3b2; was not deposited in the vasculature or removed to the plasma, and there was no stimulation of activity or expression of major A&#x3b2;-clearing enzymes (neprilysin, insulin degrading enzyme, or endothelin-converting enzyme).

There is emerging evidence that deregulation of Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular (Eph) receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) signaling contributes to the aberrant synaptic functions associated with neurodegeneration. The Eph receptor A4 is highly expressed in human adult hippocampal brain tissue and was previously linked to cognitive impairment in a transgenic mouse model for AD. Whether EphA4 levels are altered in AD brain remains elusive.","conclusion":"The total EphA4 protein levels were not changed in AD patients compared to control cases. However, immunohistochemical localization of EphA4 revealed an altered distribution in AD compared to control hippocampus. EphA4 immunoreactivity was observed in plaque-like structures in AD cases. Double-labelling with phosphorylated tau and amyloid beta indicates that EphA4 co-localizes with neuritic plaques in AD. This altered distribution pattern was observed at early stages (Braak stage II) and correlates with the hallmarks of AD pathology suggesting a reduced availability of EphA4 that is likely to contribute to synaptic dysfunction that occurs early in AD."},{"method":"We analyzed two genes that were sites of frequent transposon insertion and highly expressed in human medulloblastomas: Arnt (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator) and Gdi2 (GDP dissociation inhibitor 2).

We overexpressed Arnt and Gdi2 in a human medulloblastoma cell line (DAOY) and an immortalized, nontransformed cell line derived from mouse granule neuron precursors (SHH-NPD) and quantified migration, invasiveness, and anchorage-independent growth, cell traits that are associated with metastatic competence in carcinomas.","background":"Leptomeningeal dissemination (LMD), the metastatic spread of tumor cells via the cerebrospinal fluid to the brain and spinal cord, is an ominous prognostic sign for patients with the pediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma. The need to reduce the risk of LMD has driven the development of aggressive treatment regimens, which cause disabling neurotoxic side effects in long-term survivors. Transposon-mediated mutagenesis studies in mice have revealed numerous candidate metastasis genes. Understanding how these genes drive LMD will require functional assessment using in vivo and cell culture models of medulloblastoma.","conclusion":"In SHH-NPD cells. Arnt and Gdi2 stimulated all three traits. In DAOY cells, Arnt had the same effects, but Gdi2 stimulated invasiveness only. These results support a mechanism whereby Arnt and Gdi2 cause cells to detach from the primary tumor mass by increasing cell motility and invasiveness.

Secondary injury was not uncommon, with vernicomyelia in Chiari malformations, infarct like histology, or old hemorrhage in 8 cases of syringomyelia. Vernicomyelia did not occur in the absence of syrinx formation. The syringes extended from the sites of dysraphism, in ascending or descending patterns.

The major neuropathological lesions in AD are accumulation of amyloid &#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;) as amyloid plaques and congophilic amyloid angiopathy, as well as aggregated tau in the form of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). In addition, inflammation and microglia\/macrophage function play an important role in AD pathogenesis.

In vivo, Pax3 enhances PDGF-B-driven gliomagenesis by shortening tumor latency and increasing tumor penetrance and grade, in a region-specific manner, while loss of Pax3 function extends survival of PDGF-B-driven;p53-deficient BSG-bearing mice by 33%. Importantly, Pax3 is regionally expressed in human glioma as well, with high PAX3 mRNA characterizing 40% of human BSG, revealing a subset of tumors that significantly associates with PDGFRA alterations, amplifications of cell cycle regulatory genes, and is exclusive of ACVR1 mutations.

Notably, AD-pretangles showed a strong tendency to form fibrillary tangles even at an early stage, whereas pretangles or Pick-like inclusions in tissue from patients with CBD did not even at an advanced stage. In conclusion, AD-pretangles and CBD-pretangles showed essential differences at the EM level."},{"method":"Here, by combining a selectively timed regulatory T cells depletion with 2-photon microscopy, we report that regulatory T cells exercise their dynamic control over effector T cells in the CNS.","background":"Regulatory T cells are crucial in controlling various functions of effector T cells during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. While regulatory T cells are reported to exert their immunomodulatory effects in the peripheral immune organs, their role within the central nervous system (CNS) during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is unclear.","conclusion":"Acute depletion of regulatory T cells exacerbated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis severity which was accompanied by increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production and proliferation of effector T cells. Intravital microscopy revealed that, in the absence of regulatory T cells, the velocity of effector T cells was decreased with simultaneous increase in the proportion of stationary phase cells in the CNS. Based on these data, we conclude that regulatory T cells mediate recovery from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by controlling cytokine production, proliferation and motility of effector T cells in the CNS."},{"method":"Here we took a novel approach to identify factors that may inhibit or support endogenous remyelination in MS. We dissected remyelinated, demyelinated active, and demyelinated inactive white matter MS lesions, and compared transcript levels of myelination and inflammation-related genes using quantitative PCR on customized TaqMan Low Density Arrays.","background":"Chronic demyelination is a pathological hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS). Only a minority of MS lesions remyelinates completely. Enhancing remyelination is, therefore, a major aim of future MS therapies.","conclusion":"In remyelinated lesions, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 1 was the most abundant of all analyzed myelination-regulating factors, showed a trend towards higher expression as compared to demyelinated lesions and was significantly higher than in control white matter. Two MS tissue blocks comprised lesions with adjacent de- and remyelinated areas and FGF1 expression was higher in the remyelinated rim compared to the demyelinated lesion core. In functional experiments, FGF1 accelerated developmental myelination in dissociated mixed cultures and promoted remyelination in slice cultures, whereas it decelerated differentiation of purified primary oligodendrocytes, suggesting that promotion of remyelination by FGF1 is based on an indirect mechanism. The analysis of human astrocyte responses to FGF1 by genome wide expression profiling showed that FGF1 induced the expression of the chemokine CXCL8 and leukemia inhibitory factor, two factors implicated in recruitment of oligodendrocytes and promotion of remyelination. Together, this study presents a transcript profiling of remyelinated MS lesions and identified FGF1 as a promoter of remyelination. Modulation of FGF family members might improve myelin repair in MS."},{"method":"Aiming to generate an innovative human-based model to facilitate the identification of predictive biomarkers associated with the disease, we developed a unique ALS tissue-engineered skin model (ALS-TES) derived from patient's own cells.","background":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset disease characterized by the selective degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord progressively leading to paralysis and death. Current diagnosis of ALS is based on clinical assessment of related symptoms. The clinical manifestations observed in ALS appear relatively late in the disease course after degeneration of a significant number of motor neurons. As a result, the identification and development of disease-modifying therapies is difficult. Therefore, novel strategies for early diagnosis of neurodegeneration, to monitor disease progression and to assess response to existing and future treatments are urgently needed. Factually, many neurological disorders, including ALS, are accompanied by skin changes that often precede the onset of neurological symptoms.","conclusion":"The ALS-TES presents a number of striking features including altered epidermal differentiation, abnormal dermo-epidermal junction, delamination, keratinocyte infiltration, collagen disorganization and cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions. Remarkably, these abnormal skin defects, uniquely seen in the ALS-derived skins, were detected in pre-symtomatic C9orf72-linked ALS patients carrying the GGGGCC DNA repeat expansion. Consequently, our ALS skin model could represent a renewable source of human tissue, quickly and easily accessible to better understand the physiophatological mechanisms underlying this disease, to facilitate the identification of disease-specific biomarkers, and to develop innovative tools for early diagnosis and disease monitoring."},{"method":"To elucidate the neuronal function of LAMP-2 we analyzed knockout mice for neuropathological changes, MA and steady-state levels of CMA substrates.","background":"The Lysosomal Associated Membrane Protein type-2 (LAMP-2) is an abundant lysosomal membrane protein with an important role in immunity, macroautophagy (MA) and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Mutations within the Lamp2 gene cause Danon disease, an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder characterized by (cardio)myopathy and intellectual dysfunction. The pathological hallmark of this disease is an accumulation of glycogen and autophagic vacuoles in cardiac and skeletal muscle that, along with the myopathy, is also present in LAMP-2-deficient mice. Intellectual dysfunction observed in the human disease suggests a pivotal role of LAMP-2 within brain. LAMP-2A, one specific LAMP-2 isoform, was proposed to be important for the lysosomal degradation of selective proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's and Parkinson's disease.","conclusion":"The absence of LAMP-2 in murine brain led to inflammation and abnormal behavior, including motor deficits and impaired learning. The latter abnormality points to hippocampal dysfunction caused by altered lysosomal activity, distinct accumulation of p62-positive aggregates, autophagic vacuoles and lipid storage within hippocampal neurons and their presynaptic terminals. The absence of LAMP-2 did not apparently affect MA or steady-state levels of selected CMA substrates in brain or neuroblastoma cells under physiological and prolonged starvation conditions. Our data contribute to the understanding of intellectual dysfunction observed in Danon disease patients and highlight the role of LAMP-2 within the central nervous system, particularly the hippocampus."},{"method":"A systematic review of literature was performed by searching PubMed and Web of Science using predefined keywords. Of considered research papers the methods section was reviewed to select publications that enabled us to answer our learning objective. After quality assessment, antibody characteristics and related outcomes were extracted.","background":"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is one of the leading causes of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. A high-ranking candidate to become a diagnostic marker for a major pathological subtype of FTLD is the transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43). The main objective is to elucidate which antibodies are specific for pathological TDP-43, with special interest in its modified isoforms. Indeed, TDP-43 has been shown to be hyperphosphorylated and truncated in disease. A secondary objective is to review existing immunoassays that quantify TDP-43 in biofluids.","conclusion":"We identified a series of well-characterized antibodies based on a scoring system that assessed the ability of each antibody to detect TDP-43 pathology. A selection of 29 unique antibodies was made comprising 10 high-ranking antibodies which were reported multiple times to detect TDP-43 pathology in both immunostaining and immunoblotting experiments and 19 additional antibodies which detected TDP-43 pathology but were only scored once. This systematic review provides an overview of antibodies that are reported to detect pathological TDP-43. These antibodies can be used in future studies of TDP-43 proteinopathies. Additionally, selected antibodies hold the potential to be used in the development of novel immunoassays for the quantification of TDP-43 in biofluids, as a possible biomarker for FTLD-TDP."},{"method":"We therefore undertook the present survey to investigate whether changes in the IEB function and\/or morphology occur in PD. Colonic biopsies were performed in 31 PD patients and 11 age-matched healthy controls. The para- and transcellular permeability were evaluated by measuring sulfonic acid and horseradish peroxidase flux respectively, in colonic biopsies mounted in Ussing chambers. The expression and localization of the two tight junctions proteins ZO-1 and occludin were analyzed by Western blot and immunofluorescence, respectively.","background":"Functional and morphological alterations of the intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) have been consistently reported in digestive disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. There is mounting evidence that Parkinson's disease (PD) is not only a brain disease but also a digestive disorder. Gastrointestinal involvement is a frequent and early event in the course of PD, and it may be critically involved in the early development of the disease.","conclusion":"The para- and transcellular permeability were not different between PD patients and controls. The expression of occludin, but not ZO-1, was significantly lower in colonic samples from PD patients as compared to controls and the cellular distribution of both proteins was altered in colonic mucosal specimens from PD patients. Our findings provide evidence that the IEB is morphologically altered in PD and further reinforce the potential role of the gastrointestinal tract in the initiation and\/or the progression of the disease."},{"method":"Analysis of a comprehensive panel of 113 tumors showed robust NHERF1 labeling of microlumens in 100% of ependymomas, subependymomas, and pediatric anaplastic ependymomas, and in 67% of adult anaplastic ependymomas.

NHERF1-deficient mice have intestinal brush border structural defects and we report here that they also have disorganized ependymal cilia with development of non-obstructive hydrocephalus. Examination of mouse and human brain tissues revealed highest NHERF1 expression at the apical plasma membrane of ependymal cells. In ependymal tumors, NHERF1 expression was retained in polarized membrane structures, such as microlumens, rosettes and canals, where it co-localized with some of its ligands, such as moesin and PTEN.","conclusion":"NHERF1 labeling of microlumens was either absent or rarely seen in other types of brain tumors analyzed, denoting NHERF1 as a reliable diagnostic marker of ependymal tumors. Anaplastic foci and a subset of adult anaplastic ependymomas showed complete absence of NHERF1-labeled polarity structures, consistent with a loss of differentiation in these aggressive tumors. These data highlight a role for NHERF1 in ependymal morphogenesis with direct application to the diagnosis of ependymal tumors."},{"method":"Hippocampal dysfunction was further investigated in an animal model for sepsis using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injections to induce endotoxemia in rats, followed by electrophysiological recordings in brain slices.","background":"Septic encephalopathy is associated with rapid deterioration of cortical functions. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) we detected functional abnormalities in the hippocampal formation of patients with septic delirium.","conclusion":"Endotoxemia induced a deficit in long term potentiation which was completely reversed by apamin, a blocker of small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels, and partly restored by treatment with physostigmine (eserine), an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, or TBPB, a selective M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist. These results suggest a novel role for SK channels in the etiology of endotoxemia and explain why boosting cholinergic function restores deficits in synaptic plasticity.

Strong P&#x3b1;Syn expression was observed in neuronal granules in KO mice before onset of motor symptoms. The granules were mitochondrial outer membrane protein (TOM20)-positive. Ultramicroscopy revealed that P&#x3b1;Syn-positive granules were localized to mitochondria with degenerated inner membranes. After symptom onset, TOM20-positive granules were frequently found in ubiquitinated spheroids, where P&#x3b1;Syn expression was low. Axons were atrophic, but the neuronal loss was not evident in KO mice. In PLAN neurons, small P&#x3b1;Syn-positive inclusions with a TOM20-positive edge were frequently observed and clustered into LBs. The surfaces of most LBs were TOM20-positive in PLAN and TOM20-negative in PD brains. The high proportion of LB-bearing neurons and the preserved neuronal number in PLAN suggested long-term survival of LB-bearing neurons. Elevated expression of &#x3b1;Syn\/P&#x3b1;Syn in mitochondria appears to be the early response to PLA2G6-deficiency in neurons.

We also reviewed the clinical records of 72 FTLD cases, and clarified additional clinical features that are predictive of the BIBD pathology.","background":"Choreoathetoid involuntary movements are rarely reported in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), suggesting their exclusion as a supportive feature in clinical diagnostic criteria for FTLD.","conclusion":"Symptom onset in the three patients with chorea was at 44.0&#xa0;years of age (&#xb1;12.0&#xa0;years), and occurred in the absence of a family history of dementia. The cases were consistent with a clinical form of FTD known as bvFTD, as well as reduced neurological muscle tone in addition to chorea. The three patients showed no or mild parkinsonism, which by contrast, increased substantially in the other FTLD cases until a later stage of disease. The three patients exhibited severe caudate atrophy, which has previously been reported as a histological feature distinguishing FTLD-FUS from FTLD-tau or FTLD-TAR DNA-binding protein 43. Thus, our findings suggest that the clinical feature of choreoathetosis in bvFTD might be associated with FTLD-FUS, and in particular, with the BIBD subtype."},{"method":"We observed C9orf72 was generally lowly expressed with the exception of a subset of myeloid cells, particularly CD14+ monocytes that showed up to seven fold higher expression as compared to central nervous system (CNS) and other tissues. The expression profile at the C9orf72 locus showed a complex architecture with differential expression of the transcription start sites (TSSs) for the annotated C9orf72 transcripts between myeloid and CNS tissues suggesting cell and\/or tissue specific functions. We further detected novel TSSs in both the sense and antisense strand at the C9orf72 locus and confirmed their existence in brain tissues and CD14+ monocytes.","background":"A non-coding hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in C9orf72 is a common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) acting through a loss of function mechanism due to haploinsufficiency of C9orf72 or a gain of function mediated by aggregates of bidirectionally transcribed HRE-RNAs translated into di-peptide repeat (DPR) proteins. To fully understand regulation of C9orf72 expression we surveyed the C9orf72 locus using Cap Analysis of Gene Expression sequence data (CAGEseq).","conclusion":"Interestingly, our experiments showed a consistent decrease of C9orf72 coding transcripts not only in brain tissue and monocytes from C9orf72-HRE patients, but also in brains from MAPT and GRN mutation carriers together with an increase in antisense transcripts suggesting these could play a role in regulation of C9orf72. We found that the non-HRE related expression changes cannot be explained by promoter methylation but by the presence of the C9orf72-HRE risk haplotype and unknown functional interactions between C9orf72, MAPT and GRN."},{"method":"Using hippocampal slice cultures, we found that ~70 % of spines with protrusions in CA1 pyramidal neurons contained synaptopodin. Analysis of synaptopodin-deficient neurons revealed that synaptopodin is required for the stability but not the formation of SHPs. The effects of synaptopodin could be linked to its role in Ca(2+) homeostasis, since spines with protrusions often contained ryanodine receptors and synaptopodin. Furthermore, disrupting Ca(2+) signaling shortened protrusion lifetime. By transgenically reintroducing synaptopodin on a synaptopodin-deficient background, SHP stability could be rescued.","background":"Neurological diseases associated with neuronal death are also accompanied by axonal denervation of connected brain regions. In these areas, denervation leads to a decrease in afferent drive, which may in turn trigger active central nervous system (CNS) circuitry rearrangement. This rewiring process is important therapeutically, since it can partially recover functions and can be further enhanced using modern rehabilitation strategies. Nevertheless, the cellular mechanisms of brain rewiring are not fully understood. We recently reported a mechanism by which neurons remodel their local connectivity under conditions of network-perturbance: hippocampal pyramidal cells can extend spine head protrusions (SHPs), which reach out toward neighboring terminals and form new synapses. Since this form of activity-dependent rewiring is observed only on some spines, we investigated the required conditions. We speculated, that the actin-associated protein synaptopodin, which is involved in several synaptic plasticity mechanisms, could play a role in the formation and\/or stabilization of SHPs.","conclusion":"Overall, we show that synaptopodin increases the stability of SHPs, and could potentially modulate the rewiring of microcircuitries by making synaptic reorganization more efficient."},{"method":"Here, we have performed a prospective nationwide genetic association study using the Human Exome BeadChip and identified gene variants in encoding dynactin 4 (DCTN4), retinoic acid early transcript 1E (RAET1E), and V-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 3 (AKT3) to be associated with unfavourable outcome in patients with pneumococcal meningitis. No clinical replication cohort is available, so we validated the role of one of these targets, AKT3, in a pneumococcal meningitis mouse model.","background":"Pneumococcal meningitis is the most common and severe form of bacterial meningitis. Fatality rates are substantial, and long-term sequelae develop in about half of survivors.","conclusion":"Akt3 deficient mice had worse survival and increased histopathology scores for parenchymal damage (infiltration) and vascular infiltration (large meningeal artery inflammation) but similar bacterial loads, cytokine responses, compared to wild-type mice. We found no differences in cerebrospinal fluid cytokine levels between patients with risk or non-risk alleles.

From a functional point of view, the TDP-43 mislocalization, that occurs in a human experimental neuronal model system, is associated with specific alterations in TDP-43 controlled genes. Most interestingly, treatment with N-Acetyl-cysteine (NAC) or beta-cyclodextrin (CD) can partially restore TDP-43 nuclear localization.","background":"Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the occurrence of visceral and neurological symptoms.

For the first time in a genetic condition, we have also shown a disease-related increase in the frequency of Purkinje cell fusion and heterokaryon formation in Friedreich's ataxia cases; with evidence that underlying levels of cerebellar inflammation influence heterokaryon formation.

Microarray analysis, however, demonstrated changes in neuropeptide gene expression and other markers, indicating altered GABAergic neuronal function. Calcium binding protein and GAD65\/67 immunohistochemistry showed preserved interneurone populations indicating possible interneurone dysfunction.

This incurable disease is clinically heterogeneous and its aetiology remains unknown. Increased excitability of corticospinal MNs has been observed prior to symptoms in human and rodent studies. Increased excitability has been correlated with structural changes in neuronal dendritic arbors and spines for decades.","conclusion":"Progressive decreases in dendritic length and spine density commencing at pre-symptomatic ages (P8-15 or P28-35) were observed in layer V pyramidal neurons within the motor cortex and medial pre-frontal cortex of SOD1 mice compared to WT mice. Spine loss without concurrent dendritic pathology was present in the pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex from disease-onset (P65-75). Our results from the SOD1 model suggest that dendritic and dendritic spine changes foreshadow and underpin the neuromotor phenotypes present in ALS and may contribute to the varied cognitive, executive function and extra-motor symptoms commonly seen in ALS patients. Determining if these phenomena are compensatory or maladaptive may help explain differential susceptibility of neurons to degeneration in ALS."},{"method":"To model vascular cognitive impairment, we induced prolonged mild cerebral hypoperfusion in mice by bilateral common carotid artery stenosis. This chronic hypoperfusion resulted in reactive gliosis of astrocytes and microglia within white matter tracts, demyelination and axonal degeneration, consecutive spatial memory deficits, and loss of white matter integrity, as measured by ultra&#xa0;high-field magnetic resonance&#xa0;diffusion tensor imaging. White matter astrogliosis was accompanied by activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kB in reactive astrocytes. Using mice expressing a dominant negative inhibitor of NF-kB under the control of the astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) promoter (GFAP-IkB&#x3b1;-dn), we found that transgenic inhibition of astroglial NF-kB signaling ameliorated gliosis and axonal loss, maintained white matter structural integrity, and preserved memory function.","background":"Vascular cognitive impairment is the second most common form of dementia. The pathogenic pathways leading to vascular cognitive impairment remain unclear but clinical and experimental data have shown that chronic reactive astrogliosis occurs within white matter lesions, indicating that a sustained pro-inflammatory environment affecting the white matter may contribute towards disease progression.","conclusion":"Collectively, our results imply that pro-inflammatory changes in white matter astrocytes may represent an important detrimental component in the pathogenesis of vascular cognitive impairment, and that targeting these pathways may lead to novel therapeutic strategies."},{"method":"Recently, several research groups have reported transgenic vertebrate models of FUSopathy, with varying results.","background":"Disruptions to genes linked to RNA processing and homeostasis are implicated in the pathogenesis of two pathologically related but clinically heterogeneous neurodegenerative diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations in the Fused-in-Sarcoma (FUS) gene encoding a 526 amino-acid RNA-binding protein are found in a small subset of ALS cases, but FUS mutations do not appear to be a direct cause of FTD. Structural and functional similarities between FUS and another ALS-related RNA-binding protein, TDP-43, highlight the potential importance of aberrant RNA processing in ALS\/FTD, and this pathway is now a major focus of interest.","conclusion":"Here, we discuss the evidence for FUS pathogenicity in ALS\/FTD, review the experimental approaches used and phenotypic features of FUS rodent models reported to date, and outline their contribution to our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms. Further refinement of vertebrate models will likely aid our understanding of the role of FUS in both diseases."},{"method":"Using a sequence kernel association (SKAT) analysis in two independent AD cohorts, we found significant enrichment of rare TREM2 variants not previously characterized at the protein level. Heterologous expression of the identified variants showed that novel variants S31F and R47C displayed significantly reduced cell surface expression.","background":"Rare variation in TREM2 has been associated with greater risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). TREM2 encodes a cell surface receptor expressed on microglia and related cells, and the R47H variant associated with AD appears to affect the ability of TREM2 to bind extracellular ligands. In addition, other rare TREM2 mutations causing early-onset neurodegeneration are thought to impair cell surface expression.","conclusion":"In addition, we identified rare variant R136Q in a patient with language-predominant AD that also showed impaired surface expression. The results suggest rare TREM2 variants enriched in AD may be associated with altered TREM2 function and that AD risk may be conferred, in part, from altered TREM2 surface expression."},{"method":"In the present study, we provide results from neuropathological analyses of four supercentenarian autopsy cases using conventional and immunohistochemical analysis for neurodegenerative disorders.

TDP-43 deposits were present in the hippocampus in two cases. Neither Lewy body pathology nor hippocampal sclerosis was observed. Aging-related tau astrogliopathy was consistently observed, particularly in the basal forebrain. Small vessel diseases were also present, but they were relatively mild for cerebral amyloid-beta angiopathy and arteriolosclerosis. Although our study involved a small number of cases, the results provide a better understanding about human longevity. Neuropathological alterations associated with aging were mild to moderate in the supercentenarian brain, suggesting that these individuals might have some neuroprotective factors against aging.

Notably, seven PTP genes (DUSP26, MTMR4, PTEN, PTPRM, PTPRN2, PTPRT and PTPRZ1) were differentially expressed between grade II-III gliomas and (grade IV) glioblastomas. For DUSP26, PTEN, PTPRM and PTPRT, lower expression levels correlated with poor prognosis, and overexpression of DUSP26 or PTPRT in E98 glioblastoma cells reduced tumorigenicity. Our study represents the first in-depth analysis of PTP family expression in diffuse glioma subtypes and warrants further investigations into PTP-dependent signaling events as new entry points for improved therapy."},{"method":"Here we report that microglia in the dentate gyrus (DG) of cx3cr1 (-\/-) mice displayed elevated microglial sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression levels and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) p65 activation, despite unaltered morphology when compared to cx3cr1 (+\/-) or cx3cr1 (+\/+) controls. This phenotype was restricted to the DG and accompanied by reduced adult neurogenesis in cx3cr1 (-\/-) mice. Remarkably, adult neurogenesis was not affected by the lack of the CX3CR1-ligand, fractalkine (CX3CL1). Mechanistically, pharmacological activation of SIRT1 improved adult neurogenesis in the DG together with an enhanced performance of cx3cr1 (-\/-) mice in a hippocampus-dependent learning and memory task. The reverse condition was induced when SIRT1 was inhibited in cx3cr1 (-\/-) mice, causing reduced adult neurogenesis and lowered hippocampal cognitive abilities.","background":"Homo and heterozygote cx3cr1 mutant mice, which harbor a green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in their cx3cr1 loci, represent a widely used animal model to study microglia and peripheral myeloid cells.","conclusion":"In conclusion, our data indicate that deletion of CX3CR1 from microglia under resting conditions modifies brain areas with elevated cellular turnover independent of CX3CL1."},{"method":"In 11 patients, six had phosphorylated TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (pTDP-43)-immunoreactive (ir) neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCI), two had fused in sarcoma (FUS)-ir NCI, and three had copper\/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1)-ir NCI.

In patients with pTDP-43-ir NCI, patients with NCI in the hippocampal dentate granule neurons (DG) showed a neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex, and patients without NCI in DG showed a preserved cerebral cortex. By contrast, in patients with FUS-ir NCI, patients with NCI in DG showed a preserved cerebral cortex and patients without NCI in DG showed marked cerebral degeneration. The cerebral cortex of patients with SOD1-ir NCI was preserved. Together, these findings suggest that lesions of the cerebrum are probably not necessary for progression to Stage V. In conclusion, patients with ALS that had progressed to result in communication Stage V showed rapidly-progressed symptoms, and their common lesions could cause the manifestations of communication Stage V."},{"method":"In this study we aimed to assess whether the structural behavior of human A&#x3b2;42 peptide inside the brain is influenced by the concomitant presence of N-terminal fragments produced by the proteolytic activity of glial cells.","background":"Substantial data indicate that amyloid-&#x3b2; (A&#x3b2;), the major component of senile plaques, plays a central role in Alzheimer's Disease and indeed the assembly of naturally occurring amyloid peptides into cytotoxic aggregates is linked to the disease pathogenesis.

Cells use also tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), filamentous-actin-containing membranous structures that bridge and connect cells. First described in immune cells, TNTs facilitate HIV-1 transfer and are found in various cell types, including neurons.","conclusion":"This is important because Tau appears beside filamentous actin and myosin 10 as a specific marker of these fine protrusions of membranes and cytosol that are difficult to visualize. Furthermore, we observed that exogenous Tau species increase the number of TNTs established between primary neurons, thereby facilitating the intercellular transfer of Tau fibrils. In conclusion, Tau may contribute to the formation and function of the highly dynamic TNTs that may be involved in the prion-like propagation of Tau assemblies."},{"method":"Using a nanoString-based 80-gene custom codeset specific for developmental pathways, we identified a differential stem cell gene expression profile within human pituitary adenomas.

The tumor-initiating capacity of CD15<sup>high<\/sup> adenoma cells was assayed in comparison to CD15<sup>low<\/sup> adenomas using in vivo limiting dilutions, which maintained the rare frequency of TICs.

In the visual cortex, in vivo HSP induced by visual deprivation shows a similar over-response following an A&#x3b2; local injection.","background":"The over-production of &#x3b2;-amyloid (A&#x3b2;) has been strongly correlated to neuronal dysfunction and altered synaptic plasticity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accordingly, it has been proposed that disrupted synaptic transmission and neuronal network instability underlie memory failure that is evident in the early phases of AD. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) serves to restrain neuronal activity within a physiological range.

Both GluA2-lacking and GluA2-containing AMPARs contribute to the A&#x3b2;-mediated over-scaling of HSP. We also find that A&#x3b2; induces the dissociation of HDAC1 from the miR124 transcription factor EVI1, leading to an up-regulation of miR124 expression and increased amount of CP-AMPARs.

Immunoblotting analyses revealed that ENSA was down-regulated in the brains of synucleinopathy patients versus non-diseased individuals. Collectively, these results suggest that ENSA can alleviate neurotoxic effects of membrane-bound aSyn via an apparent chaperone-like activity at the membrane surface, and a decrease in ENSA expression may contribute to aSyn neuropathology in synucleinopathy disorders.

However, we found no evidence of an association between rare inherited variants of mtDNA or mtDNA heteroplasmy and disease.

AxDs, especially those reaching larger sizes, had long lifetimes and appeared as highly plastic structures with large variations in size and shape and axonal sprouting over time. In the case of the APP-PS1 mouse only, the formation of new long axonal segments in dystrophic axons (re-growth phenomenon) was observed. Moreover, new AxDs could appear at the same point of the axon where a previous AxD had been located before disappearance (re-formation phenomenon). In addition, we observed that most AxDs were formed and developed during the imaging period, and numerous AxDs had already disappeared by the end of this time. This work is the first in vivo study analyzing quantitatively the high plasticity of the axonal pathology around A&#x3b2; plaques.

Revised CNS tumor diagnostic criteria also attempt to reduce interobserver variability of histological interpretation and provide more accurate stratification related to clinical outcome. As an example, diffuse gliomas (WHO grades II-IV) are now molecularly stratified based upon isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDH) mutational status, with gliomas of WHO grades II and III being substratified according to 1p\/19q codeletion status. For now, grading of diffuse gliomas is still dependent upon histological parameters.","conclusion":"Here we show that molecular multidimensional scaling of TCGA data provides 2D clustering that represents the 2016 WHO classification of diffuse gliomas. Additionally, we used this platform to successfully identify and define novel copy-number alteration-based molecular subtypes, which are independent of WHO grading, as well as predictive of clinical outcome. The prognostic utility of these molecular subtypes was further validated using an independent data set of the German Glioma Network prospective glioblastoma patient cohort."},{"method":"In mouse, using in vivo repression and overexpression of PLGF, we investigated the contribution of placenta on fetal brain angiogenesis. In human, we performed a comparative molecular and morphological analysis of brain\/placenta angiogenesis in alcohol-exposed fetuses.","background":"Most children with in utero alcohol exposure do not exhibit all features of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), and a challenge for clinicians is to make an early diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) to avoid lost opportunities for care. In brain, correct neurodevelopment requires proper angiogenesis. Since alcohol alters brain angiogenesis and the placenta is a major source of angiogenic factors, we hypothesized that it is involved in alcohol-induced brain vascular defects.","conclusion":"Results showed that prenatal alcohol exposure impairs placental angiogenesis, reduces PLGF levels and consequently alters fetal brain vasculature. Placental repression of PLGF altered brain VEGF-R1 expression and mimicked alcohol-induced vascular defects in the cortex. Over-expression of placental PGF rescued alcohol effects on fetal brain vessels. In human, alcohol exposure disrupted both placental and brain angiogenesis. PLGF expression was strongly decreased and angiogenesis defects observed in the fetal brain markedly correlated with placental vascular impairments. Placental PGF disruption impairs brain angiogenesis and likely predicts brain disabilities after in utero alcohol exposure.

Here, we show that lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs) are dysregulated in multiple sclerosis (MS) and are functionally relevant in this disease.","conclusion":"Serum LPAs were reduced in MS and EAE whereas spinal cord LPAs in TCR<sup>1640<\/sup> mice increased during the 'symptom-free' intervals, i.e. on resolution of inflammation during recovery hence possibly pointing to positive effects of brain LPAs during remyelination as suggested in previous studies. Peripheral LPAs mildly re-raised during relapses but further dropped in refractory relapses. The peripheral loss led to a redistribution of immune cells from the spleen to the spinal cord, suggesting defects of lymphocyte homing. In support, LPAR2 positive T-cells were reduced in EAE and the disease was intensified in Lpar2 deficient mice.

In vivo, PBT434 did not deplete tissue iron stores in normal rodents, yet prevented loss of substantia nigra pars compacta neurons (SNpc), lowered nigral &#x3b1;-synuclein accumulation, and rescued motor performance in mice exposed to the Parkinsonian toxins 6-OHDA and MPTP, and in a transgenic animal model (hA53T &#x3b1;-synuclein) of PD.","background":"Elevated iron in the SNpc may play a key role in Parkinson's disease (PD) neurodegeneration since drug candidates with high iron affinity rescue PD animal models, and one candidate, deferirpone, has shown efficacy recently in a phase two clinical trial. However, strong iron chelators may perturb essential iron metabolism, and it is not yet known whether the damage associated with iron is mediated by a tightly bound (eg ferritin) or lower-affinity, labile, iron pool.","conclusion":"These improvements were associated with reduced markers of oxidative damage, and increased levels of ferroportin (an iron exporter) and DJ-1.

For instance, AD has a progression of tau pathology consistently beginning in the entorhinal cortex, the locus coeruleus, and other nearby noradrenergic brainstem nuclei, before spreading to the rest of the limbic system as well as the cingulate and retrosplenial cortices. Proposed explanations for the consistent spatial patterns of tau pathology progression, as well as for why certain regions are selectively vulnerable to exhibiting pathology over the course of disease generally focus on transsynaptic spread proceeding via the brain's anatomic connectivity network in a cell-independent manner or on cell-intrinsic properties that might render some cell populations or regions uniquely vulnerable.","conclusion":"We find that across both exogenously seeded and non-seeded tauopathic mouse models, the connectivity network provides a better explanation than regional gene expression profiles, even when such profiles are limited to specific sets of tau risk-related genes only. Our results suggest that, regardless of the location of pathology initiation, tau pathology progression is well characterized by a model positing entirely cell-type and molecular environment independent transsynaptic spread via the mouse brain's connectivity network. These results further suggest that regional vulnerability to tau pathology is mainly governed by connectivity with regions already exhibiting pathology, rather than by cell-intrinsic factors."},{"method":"Here, we report evidence that CD59 is responsible for protection of peripheral, AQP4-expressing tissues in seropositive NMO.

We further showed that the expression of TDP-43 in transgenic Drosophila neurons induced ER stress and that co-expression of clusterin resulted in a dramatic clearance of mislocalized TDP-43 from motor neuron axons, partially rescued locomotor activity and significantly extended lifespan. We also showed that in Drosophila photoreceptor cells, clusterin co-expression gave ER stress-dependent protection against proteotoxicity arising from both Huntingtin-Q128 and mutant (R406W) human tau.

Munc18-1-knockdown impaired cortical neuron positioning during mouse corticogenesis. Time-lapse imaging revealed that the mispositioning was attributable to defects in radial migration in the intermediate zone and cortical plate. Notably, Syntaxin1A was critical for radial migration downstream of Munc18-1. As for the underlying mechanism, Munc18-1-knockdown in cortical neurons hampered post-Golgi vesicle trafficking and subsequent vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Notably, Syntaxin1A-silencing did not affect the post-Golgi vesicle trafficking.","background":"While Munc18-1 interacts with Syntaxin1 and controls the formation of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNARE) complex to regulate presynaptic vesicle fusion in developed neurons, this molecule is likely to be involved in brain development since its gene abnormalities cause early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-burst (Ohtahara syndrome), neonatal epileptic encephalopathy and other neurodevelopmental disorders.","conclusion":"Taken together, Munc18-1 was suggested to regulate radial migration by modulating not only vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane to distribute various proteins on the cell surface for interaction with radial fibers, but also preceding vesicle transport from Golgi to the plasma membrane. Although knockdown experiments suggested that Syntaxin1A does not participate in the vesicle trafficking, it was supposed to regulate subsequent vesicle fusion under the control of Munc18-1.

However, light microscopy studies showed that cortical thickness of the TEC was severely reduced in AD samples, but there were no changes in the volume occupied by neuronal and glial cell bodies, blood vessels, and neuropil.

To investigate a potential influence of GBA1 deficiency caused by mutations in GBA1 on the disease progression of PD, GBA1 mice carrying D409H knock-in mutation were crossbred with the human A53T (hA53T) &#x3b1;-synuclein transgenic mice.","conclusion":"Moreover, D409H GBA1 expression exacerbates the formation of insoluble aggregates of &#x3b1;-synuclein, glial activation, neuronal degeneration, and motor abnormalities in the hA53T &#x3b1;-synuclein transgenic mice. Interestingly, the expression of D409H GBA1 results in the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of hA53T transgenic mice. Taken together, these results indicate that GBA1 deficiency due to D409H mutation affects the disease onset and course in hA53T &#x3b1;-synuclein transgenic mice.

Many of these candidates (e.g. ELTD1, SDHB, SEPW1, SLC17A7, SZRD1, THAP3, ZBTB17) are likely to push, whereas others (e.g. CAP1, HBXIP, KLK6, PARK7, PTAFR) might counteract oligodendroglioma development. For example, ELTD1, a functionally validated glioblastoma oncogene located on 1p, was overexpressed. Further, the known glioblastoma tumor suppressor SLC17A7 located on 19q was underexpressed. Moreover, known epigenetic alterations triggered by mutated SDHB in paragangliomas suggest that underexpressed SDHB in oligodendrogliomas may support and possibly enhance the epigenetic reprogramming induced by the IDH-mutation. We further analyzed rarely observed deletions and duplications of chromosomal arms within oligodendroglioma subcohorts identifying putative oncogenes and tumor suppressors that possibly influence the development of oligodendroglioma subgroups. Our in-depth computational study contributes to a better understanding of the pathology of the 1p\/19q co-deletion and other chromosomal arm mutations.

Interestingly, housing in an enriched environment reduced the A&#x3b2; plaque load and vivified neurogenesis.","background":"Several studies suggest that women have a higher risk to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) than men. In particular, the number of pregnancies was shown to be a risk factor for AD and women with several pregnancies on average had an earlier onset of the disease, thus making childbearing a risk factor. However, the impact of being pregnant on A&#x3b2; plaque pathology and adult neurogenesis still remains elusive.","conclusion":"Our results suggest that pregnancy alters A&#x3b2; plaque deposition in 5xFAD transgenic mice and diminishes the generation of newborn neurons.

In contrast, T-lymphocytes are more abundant in adult GBM tissue samples. RNA sequencing of macrophages isolated from primary tumor samples revealed that DIPG- and adult GBM-associated macrophages both express gene programs related to ECM remodeling and angiogenesis, but DIPG-associated macrophages express substantially fewer inflammatory factors than their adult GBM counterparts. Examining the secretome of glioma cells, we found that patient-derived DIPG cell cultures secrete markedly fewer cytokines and chemokines than patient-derived adult GBM cultures. Concordantly, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data indicates low to absent expression of chemokines and cytokines in DIPG.","background":"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a universally fatal malignancy of the childhood central nervous system, with a median overall survival of 9-11&#xa0;months. We have previously shown that primary DIPG tissue contains numerous tumor-associated macrophages, and substantial work has demonstrated a significant pathological role for adult glioma-associated macrophages. However, work over the past decade has highlighted many molecular and genomic differences between pediatric and adult high-grade gliomas. Thus, we directly compared inflammatory characteristics of DIPG and adult glioblastoma (GBM).","conclusion":"Together, these observations suggest that the inflammatory milieu of the DIPG tumor microenvironment is fundamentally different than adult GBM. The low intrinsic inflammatory signature of DIPG cells may contribute to the lack of lymphocytes and non-inflammatory phenotype of DIPG-associated microglia\/macrophages.

In cultures of dopaminergic N2A cells, overexpression of wild-type human AS or the A53T mutant increased eEF2K activity. eEF2K inhibition prevented the cytotoxicity associated with AS overexpression in N2A cells by improving mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress. Furthermore, genetic deletion of the eEF2K ortholog efk-1 in C. elegans attenuated human A53T AS induced defects in behavioural assays reliant on dopaminergic neuron function.","background":"Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and the leading neurodegenerative cause of motor disability.

Reduced expression of the C9ORF72 gene product has been proposed as a potential contributor to disease pathogenesis. Additionally, repetitive RNAs and dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), such as poly-GR, can be produced by this hexanucleotide expansion that disrupt a number of cellular processes, potentially contributing to neural degeneration.","conclusion":"We found that transcripts encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs) regulated by the HSF1 transcription factor were significantly induced in C9ORF72-ALS\/FTLD patients relative to both sporadic ALS\/FTLD cases and controls. Treatment of human neurons with chemically synthesized DPRs was sufficient to activate a similar transcriptional response. Expression of GGGGCC repeats and also poly-GR in the brains of Drosophila lead to the upregulation of HSF1 and the same highly-conserved HSPs. Additionally, HSF1 was a modifier of poly-GR toxicity in Drosophila. Our results suggest that the expression of DPRs are associated with upregulation of HSF1 and activation of a heat shock response in C9ORF72-ALS\/FTLD."},{"method":"We asked whether differences may be present on genomic and epigenomic levels and performed a comprehensive transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis of fibroblasts, iPSCs and differentiated neuronal cells of sporadic PD-patients and controls.","background":"Differentiated neurons established via iPSCs from patients that suffer from familial Parkinson's disease (PD) have allowed insights into the mechanisms of neurodegeneration.

Moreover, miRNAs and piRNAs\/piRNA-like molecules are largely differentially regulated in cells and post-mortem tissue samples between control- and PD-patients. The most striking differences can be found in piRNAs\/piRNA-like molecules, with SINE- and LINE-derived piRNAs highly downregulated in a disease specific manner.

CBTAU-22.1 was shown to specifically bind a disease-associated phosphorylated epitope in the C-terminus of tau (Ser<sup>422<\/sup>) and to be able to inhibit the spreading of pathological tau aggregates from P301S spinal cord lysates in vitro, albeit with limited potency.","conclusion":"This affinity improved antibody showed greatly enhanced potency in a cell-based immunodepletion assay using paired helical filaments (PHFs) derived from human Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain tissue. Moreover, the affinity improved antibody limits the in vitro aggregation propensity of full length tau species specifically phosphorylated at position 422 produced by employing a native chemical ligation approach. Together, these results indicate that in addition to being able to inhibit the spreading of pathological tau aggregates, the matured antibody can potentially also interfere with the nucleation of tau which is believed to be the first step of the pathogenic process.

An expanded GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of both FTLD and motor neuron disease (MND). Dipeptide repeat polymers (DPR) are generated through repeat-associated non-ATG translation, and they aggregate in neuronal inclusions with a distribution distinct from that of TDP-43 pathology. Recent studies from animal and cell culture models suggest that DPR might be toxic, but that toxicity may differ for specific DPR. Arginine containing DPR (poly-GR and poly-PR) have the greatest toxicity and are less frequent than other DPR (poly-GP, poly-GA). A unique feature of arginine-containing DPR is their potential for post-translational modification by methyl-transferases, which produces methylarginine DPR.","conclusion":"We find that density and distribution of poly-GR inclusions are different from poly-GA and poly-GP inclusions. We also demonstrate colocalization of poly-GR with asymmetrical dimethylarginine (aDMA) immunoreactivity in regions with neurodegeneration. Differences in aDMA were also noted by clinical phenotype. FTLD-MND had the highest burden of poly-GR pathology compared to FTLD and MND, while FTLD-MND had higher burden of aDMA than FTLD. The results suggest that poly-GR pathology is associated with toxicity and neurodegeneration.

Mechanistically, cisplatin induced deacetylation of the microtubule protein &#x3b1;-tubulin and hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. These cisplatin-induced changes were reversed by HDAC6 inhibition. Our data suggest that inhibition of HDAC6 restores microtubule stability and reverses tau phosphorylation, leading to normalization of synaptosomal mitochondrial function and synaptic integrity and thereby to reversal of CICI. Remarkably, our results indicate that short-term daily treatment with the HDAC6 inhibitor was sufficient to achieve prolonged reversal of established behavioral, structural and functional deficits induced by cisplatin.

Conversely, blocking SET SUMOylation via mutating Lys 68 to Arg rescues tau pathology and cognitive impairments in C57\/BL6 mice infected with adeno-associated virus encoding SET.

Distinguishing these two populations is often challenging, owing to a paucity of universally accepted and reliable markers.","conclusion":"As top microglia DEGs, we identified P2ry12, Tmem119, Slc2a5 and Fcrls, whereas Emilin2, Gda, Hp and Sell emerged as the best DEGs for identifying peripheral monocytes\/macrophages. Lastly, we evaluated their utility in discriminating monocyte\/macrophage populations in the setting of brain pathology (glioma), and found that these DEG sets distinguished glioma-associated microglia from macrophages in both RCAS and GL261 mouse models of glioblastoma. Taken together, this unbiased bioinformatic approach facilitated the discovery of a robust set of microglia and peripheral monocyte\/macrophage expression markers to discriminate these monocyte populations in both health and disease."},{"method":"Here, we show that na&#xef;ve LEWzizi rats - Lewis rats with a zitter rat background - show a spontaneous phenotype partly mimicking the changes seen in human aging and particularly in the normal-appearing white and grey matter of patients with progressive MS.

With a median follow-up of 20.9&#x2009;months, median progression-free survival (PFS) and estimated overall survival (OS) were 11.9 and 24.0&#x2009;months, respectively. Thirteen patients (8.3%) harbored PIK3CA mutation, which was associated with younger age (mean 49.4 vs. 58.1&#x2009;years, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02). PIK3CA mutation correlated with shorter PFS (median 6.9 vs. 12.4&#x2009;months, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01) and OS (median 21.2 vs. 24.2&#x2009;months, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.049) in multivariate analysis. A significant association between PIK3CA mutation and more disseminated disease at diagnosis, as defined by gliomatosis, multicentric lesions, or distant leptomeningeal lesions, was observed (46.2% vs. 11.1%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004). In conclusion, despite the association with younger age, PIK3CA activating mutations are associated with earlier recurrence and shorter survival in adult glioblastoma. The aggressive course of these tumors may be related to their propensity for disseminated presentation."},{"method":"Employing a monoclonal anti-HTT antibody directed against the HTT mid-region and using brain tissue of three different mouse strains, we detected prominent immunoreactivity in a number of brain areas, particularly in cholinergic cranial nerve nuclei, while ubiquitous neuronal staining appeared faint. The region-specific distribution of endogenous HTT was found to be comparable in wild type rat and hamster brain. In human amyloid precursor protein transgenic Tg2576 mice with amyloid plaque pathology, similar neuronal HTT expression patterns and a distinct association of HTT with Abeta plaques were revealed by immunohistochemical double labelling. Additionally, the localization of HTT in reactive astrocytes was demonstrated for the first time in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease animal model.","background":"Pathogenic variants of the huntingtin (HTT) protein and their aggregation have been investigated in great detail in brains of Huntington's disease patients and HTT-transgenic animals. However, little is known about the physiological brain region- and cell type-specific HTT expression pattern in wild type mice and a potential recruitment of endogenous HTT to other pathogenic protein aggregates such as amyloid plaques in cross seeding events.","conclusion":"Both, plaque association of HTT and occurrence in astrocytes appeared to be age-dependent. Astrocytic HTT gene and protein expression was confirmed in primary cultures by RT-qPCR and by immunocytochemistry. We provide the first detailed analysis of physiological HTT expression in rodent brain and, under pathological conditions, demonstrate HTT aggregation in proximity to Abeta plaques and Abeta-induced astrocytic expression of endogenous HTT in Tg2576 mice."},{"method":"To answer this question, we imaged and quantified mitochondrial ATP and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub>) in resting or stimulated peripheral nerve myelinated axons in vivo, using genetically-encoded fluorescent probes, two-photon time-lapse and CARS imaging.","background":"Mitochondria are critical for the function and maintenance of myelinated axons notably through Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. A direct by-product of this ATP production is reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are highly deleterious for neurons. While ATP shortage and ROS levels increase are involved in several neurodegenerative diseases, it is still unclear whether the real-time dynamics of both ATP and ROS production in axonal mitochondria are altered by axonal or demyelinating neuropathies.","conclusion":"We found that ATP and H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub> productions are intrinsically higher in nodes of Ranvier even in resting conditions. Axonal firing increased both ATP and H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub> productions but with different dynamics: ROS production peaked shortly and transiently after the stimulation while ATP production increased gradually for a longer period of time. In neuropathic MFN2<sup>R94Q<\/sup> mice, mimicking Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2A disease, defective mitochondria failed to upregulate ATP production following axonal activity. However, elevated H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub> production was largely sustained. Finally, inducing demyelination with lysophosphatidylcholine resulted in a reduced level of ATP while H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub> level soared.

We analyzed these groups for total copy number variation (CNV), total mutation burden, chromothripsis, specific mutations, and amplifications\/deletions of specific genes\/chromosomal regions.","background":"Since the discovery that IDH1\/2 mutations confer a significantly better prognosis in astrocytomas, much work has been done to identify other molecular signatures to help further stratify lower-grade astrocytomas and glioblastomas, with the goal of accurately predicting clinical outcome and identifying potentially targetable mutations.","conclusion":"Herein, we demonstrate that across all of these tumor groups, total CNV level is a relatively consistent prognostic factor. We also identified a trend towards increased levels of chromothripsis in tumors with lower progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) intervals. While no significant differences were identified in overall mutation load, we did identify a significantly higher number of cases with mutations in genes with functions related to maintaining genomic stability in groups with higher mean CNV and worse PFS and OS intervals, particularly in the IDH-mutant groups. Our data further support the case for total CNV level as a potential prognostic factor in astrocytomas, and suggest mutations in genes responsible for overall genomic instability as a possible underlying mechanism for some astrocytomas with poor clinical outcome."},{"method":"We discovered that transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type FUS (\"Tg FUS+\/+\"), which recapitulate many aspects of human ALS, showed reduced global histone acetylation and alterations in metabolic gene expression, resulting in a dysregulated metabolic homeostasis.

In many models of neurodegeneration, global histone acetylation is decreased in the affected neuronal tissues. Histone acetylation is controlled by the antagonistic actions of two protein families -the histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and the histone deacetylases (HDACs). Drugs inhibiting HDAC activity are already used in the clinic as anti-cancer agents. The aim of this study was to explore the therapeutic potential of HDAC inhibition in the context of ALS.","conclusion":"At the molecular level, ACY-738 restored global histone acetylation and metabolic gene expression, thereby re-establishing metabolite levels in the spinal cord.

Involuntary movements, cognitive impairment and psychiatric disturbance are the major clinical manifestations, and gradual atrophy and selective neuronal loss in the striatum and cerebral cortex are the pathologic hallmarks. HD is caused by expanded CAG trinucleotide repeats at the N-terminus of IT15 that encodes the huntingtin (HTT) protein, though the molecular mechanisms through which the mutant HTT (mHTT) exerts toxic effects remain obscure. Members of the caspase family, including caspase-2 (Casp2), play an important role in HD pathogenesis. Genetic ablation of Casp2 ameliorates cognitive and motor deficits of HD mice, though the molecular targets of Casp2 are still unclear. It is well established that the microtubule-associated protein tau potentiates cognitive dysfunction in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including HD. Our recent study indicates that Casp2-catalyzed tau cleavage at aspartate 314 (tau 2N4R isoform numbering system) mediates synaptotoxicity, cognitive deficits and neurodegeneration in cellular and mouse models of frontotemporal dementia; further, levels of &#x394;tau314, the soluble, N-terminal cleavage product, are elevated in individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, compared with cognitively normal individuals.","conclusion":"Our findings advance our understanding of the contribution of Casp2-mediated &#x394;tau314 production to HD pathogenesis."},{"method":"Monoclonal antibody DC8E8, binding four highly homologous and independent epitopes in microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) of diseased tau, inhibits tau-tau interaction, discriminates between healthy and pathologically truncated tau and reduces tau pathology in animal model in vivo. Here, we show that DC8E8 antibody acts via extracellular mechanism and does not influence viability and physiological functions of neurons. Importantly, in vitro functional assays showed that DC8E8 recognises pathogenic tau proteins of different size and origin, and potently blocks their entry into neurons. Next, we examined the mechanisms by which mouse antibody DC8E8 and its humanized version AX004 effectively block the neuronal internalization of extracellular AD tau species.","background":"Pathologically altered tau protein is a common denominator of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Therefore, promising immunotherapeutic approaches target and eliminate extracellular pathogenic tau species, which are thought to be responsible for seeding and propagation of tau pathology. Tau isoforms in misfolded states can propagate disease pathology in a template-dependent manner, proposed to be mediated by the release and internalization of extracellular tau.","conclusion":"We determined a novel mode of action of a therapeutic candidate antibody, which potently inhibits neuronal internalization of AD tau species by masking of epitopes present in MTBD important for interaction with neuron surface Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans (HSPGs).

In vitro, BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup>\/TERT promoter double-mutant glioma cells showed exceptional sensitivity towards BRAF-targeting agents. Remarkably, BRAF-inhibition attenuated TERT expression and TERT promoter activity exclusively in double-mutant models, while TERT expression was undetectable in BRAF<sup>V600E<\/sup>-only cells. Various ETS-factors were broadly expressed, however, only ETS1 expression and phosphorylation were consistently downregulated following BRAF-inhibition. Knock-down experiments and ChIP corroborated the notion of a functional role for ETS1 and, accordingly, all double-mutant tumor cells were highly sensitive towards the ETS-factor inhibitor YK-4-279.

Both cell types can adopt diverse functional states that play critical roles in lesion formation and resolution.","conclusion":"In the acutely demyelinating lesion, we found multiple distinct myeloid and astrocyte phenotypes that populated separate lesion zones. In the post-demyelinating lesion, phenotypes were less distinct and more uniformly distributed. In both lesions cell-to-cell interactions were not random, but occurred between specific glial subpopulations and lymphocytes. Finally, we demonstrated that myeloid, but not astrocyte phenotypes were activated along a lesion rim-to-center gradient, and that marker expression in glial cells at the lesion rim was driven more by cell-extrinsic factors than in cells at the center. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that highly multiplexed tissue imaging, combined with the appropriate computational tools, is a powerful approach to study heterogeneity, spatial distribution and cellular interactions in the context of MS lesions. Identifying glial phenotypes and their interactions at different lesion stages may provide novel therapeutic targets for inhibiting acute demyelination and low-grade, chronic inflammation."},{"method":"Here we describe rater-blinded assessment of immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining with newly generated antibodies to different CGG RAN translation products in FXTAS and control brains as well as co-staining with ubiquitin, p62\/SQSTM1, and ubiquilin 2.","background":"CGG repeat expansions in FMR1 cause the neurodegenerative disorder Fragile X-associated Tremor\/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS).

Knowledge of the effects of ischemic axonal injury on cortical neurons is limited yet critical to identifying molecular pathways that link neurodegeneration and ischemia.","conclusion":"With this approach, we identified a role for microtubule reorganization within stroke-injured neurons acting through the regulation of tau. We find that subcortical stroke-injured Layer 5 cortical neurons up-regulate the microtubule affinity-regulating kinase, Mark4, in response to axonal injury. Stroke-induced up-regulation of Mark4 is associated with selective remodeling of the apical dendrite after stroke and the phosphorylation of tau in vivo. In a cell-based tau biosensor assay, Mark4 promotes the aggregation of human tau in vitro. Increased expression of Mark4 after ischemic axonal injury in deep layer cortical neurons provides new evidence for synergism between axonal and neurodegenerative pathologies by priming of tau phosphorylation and aggregation."},{"method":"Utilizing a panel of previously characterized &#x3b1;syn antibodies, numerous unique pathologies differentiating LBD and AD\/ALB were revealed; particularly the presence of dense neuropil &#x3b1;syn aggregates, astrocytic &#x3b1;syn, and &#x3b1;syn-containing dystrophic neurites within senile plaques.

In addition, LCO HS-169, whose emission falls in the red region of the spectrum, successfully labeled amyloid beta deposits, allowing multiplexing with other reporters whose emission falls in the green region of the spectrum.","background":"The detection of amyloid beta deposits and neurofibrillary tangles, both hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is key to understanding the mechanisms underlying these pathologies.","conclusion":"In conclusion, this method can provide a new approach for longitudinal in vivo imaging using multiphoton microscopy of AD pathologies as well as other neurodegenerative diseases associated with protein aggregation in mouse models."},{"method":"To address these questions three cohorts of human autopsy cases (in total n&#x2009;=&#x2009;271) were neuropathologically and biochemically examined for the topographical distribution of A&#x3b2; pathology (plaques and CAA), its quantity and its composition.

They stained the Lewy pathology of Parkinson's disease and the glial cytoplasmic inclusions of multiple system atrophy. Spectral analysis of HS-68-stained inclusions showed a red shift in multiple system atrophy, but the difference with Parkinson's disease was not significant. However, when inclusions were double-labelled for HS-68 and an antibody specific for &#x3b1;-synuclein phosphorylated at S129, they could be distinguished based on colour shifts with blue designated for Parkinson's disease and red for multiple system atrophy. The inclusions of Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy could also be distinguished using fluorescence lifetime imaging.","background":"Synucleinopathies [Parkinson's disease with or without dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy] are neurodegenerative diseases that are defined by the presence of filamentous &#x3b1;-synuclein inclusions.","conclusion":"These findings are consistent with the presence of distinct conformers of assembled &#x3b1;-synuclein in Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy."},{"method":"Immunohistochemistry for DPR and pTDP-43 pathology was performed in post-mortem hypothalamus and pineal gland tissue of patients with ALS and\/or FTLD-TDP with and without the C9orf72 repeat expansion and healthy controls.

It remains unknown, however, whether cells involved in the circadian sleep\/wake cycle are affected by ALS- and FTLD-related neuropathological changes including phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) aggregates and dipeptide repeat protein (DPR) inclusions resulting from the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion.","conclusion":"We observed numerous DPR inclusions (poly(GA), poly(GP), poly(GR) and poly(PR)) in the pinealocytes and few poly(GA) inclusions in the SCN-related neurons in C9orf72-related ALS and\/or FTLD-TDP cases. These circadian sleep\/wake-associated cells, however, were devoid of pTDP-43 pathology both in C9orf72- and nonC9orf72-related ALS and\/or FTLD-TDP cases.

We examined brain tissue from 33 subjects (7-10 per group). We pooled tissue from all subjects in each group for unbiased proteomic analyses followed by validation with individual case samples.","background":"Degeneration of synapses in Alzheimer's disease (AD) strongly correlates with cognitive decline, and synaptic pathology contributes to disease pathophysiology. We recently observed that the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD, apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (APOE4), is associated with exacerbated synapse loss and synaptic accumulation of oligomeric amyloid beta in human AD brain.","conclusion":"Our analysis identified over 5500 proteins in human synaptoneurosomes and highlighted disease, brain region, and APOE-associated changes in multiple molecular pathways including a decreased abundance in AD of proteins important for synaptic and mitochondrial function and an increased abundance of proteins involved in neuroimmune interactions and intracellular signaling."},{"method":"Here we demonstrate that in Alzheimer's disease frontal cortex, KLC1 levels are reduced and the relative levels of KLC1 serine-460 phosphorylation are increased; these changes occur relatively early in the disease process. We also show that a KLC1 serine-460 phosphomimetic mutant inhibits axonal transport of APP in both mammalian neurons in culture and in Drosophila neurons in vivo.","background":"Damage to axonal transport is an early pathogenic event in Alzheimer's disease. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a key axonal transport cargo since disruption to APP transport promotes amyloidogenic processing of APP. Moreover, altered APP processing itself disrupts axonal transport. The mechanisms that regulate axonal transport of APP are therefore directly relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. APP is transported anterogradely through axons on kinesin-1 motors and one route for this transport involves calsyntenin-1, a type-1 membrane spanning protein that acts as a direct ligand for kinesin-1 light chains (KLCs). Thus, loss of calsyntenin-1 disrupts APP axonal transport and promotes amyloidogenic processing of APP. Phosphorylation of KLC1 on serine-460 has been shown to reduce anterograde axonal transport of calsyntenin-1 by inhibiting the KLC1-calsyntenin-1 interaction.","conclusion":"Finally, we demonstrate that expression of the KLC1 serine-460 phosphomimetic mutant promotes amyloidogenic processing of APP. Together, these results suggest that increased KLC1 serine-460 phosphorylation contributes to Alzheimer's disease."},{"method":"Here, we used the adult fly brain to investigate whether the C9 DPRs can spread in vivo upon expression in a subset of neurons.","background":"Hexanucleotide repeat expansions of variable size in C9orf72 are the most prevalent genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Sense and antisense transcripts of the expansions are translated by repeat-associated non-AUG translation into five dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). Of these, the polyGR, polyPR and, to a lesser extent, polyGA DPRs are neurotoxic, with polyGA the most abundantly detected DPR in patient tissue. Trans-cellular transmission of protein aggregates has recently emerged as a major driver of toxicity in various neurodegenerative diseases. In vitro evidence suggests that the C9 DPRs can spread. However, whether this phenomenon occurs under more complex in vivo conditions remains unexplored.","conclusion":"We found that only polyGA can progressively spread throughout the brain, which accumulates in the shape of aggregate-like puncta inside recipient cells. Interestingly, GA transmission occurred as early as 3&#x2009;days after expression induction. By comparing the spread of 36, 100 and 200 polyGA repeats, we found that polyGA spread is enhanced upon expression of longer GA DPRs. Transmission of polyGA is greater in older flies, indicating that age-associated factors exacerbate the spread. These data highlight a unique propensity of polyGA to spread throughout the brain, which could contribute to the greater abundance of polyGA in patient tissue. In addition, we present a model of early GA transmission that is suitable for genetic screens to identify mechanisms of spread and its consequences in vivo."},{"method":"To verify this hypothesis, and to identify new predictors and therapeutic targets for persistent postoperative pain, we first established a model of postsurgical pain with perioperative sleep deprivation (SD) by administering hind paw plantar incision to sleep deprivation rats. Then we conducted behavioral tests, including tests with von Frey filaments and a laser heat test, to verify sensory pain, measured the expression of L-type calcium channels using western blotting and immunofluorescence of dorsal root ganglia (an important neural target for peripheral nociception), and examined the activity of L-type calcium channels and neuron excitability using electrophysiological measurements. We validated the findings by performing intraperitoneal injections of calcium channel blockers and microinjections of dorsal root ganglion cells with adeno-associated virus.","background":"Perioperative sleep disturbance is a risk factor for persistent pain after surgery. Clinical studies have shown that patients with insufficient sleep before and after surgery experience more intense and long-lasting postoperative pain. We hypothesize that sleep deprivation alters L-type calcium channels in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), thus delaying the recovery from post-surgical pain.","conclusion":"We found that short-term sleep deprivation before and after surgery increased expression and activity of L-type calcium channels in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia, and delayed recovery from postsurgical pain. Blocking these channels reduced impact of sleep deprivation. We conclude that the increased expression and activity of L-type calcium channels is associated with the sleep deprivation-mediated prolongation of postoperative pain. L-type calcium channels are thus a potential target for management of postoperative pain."},{"method":"To investigate how CNS endogenous signals can be harnessed to promote anti-inflammatory programs, we have used a particulate Toll-like receptor 9 and nucleotide-oligomerization domain 2 bispecific innate ligand (MIS416), to address whether its phagocytosis within the CNS recruits protective myeloid cells. We find that MIS416 injected intrathecally into the cerebrospinal fluid via the cisterna magna induced a local chemokine response that recruited blood-derived monocytes and neutrophils to the CNS. These cells phagocytosed MIS416.","background":"There is great interest in understanding how the central nervous system (CNS) communicates with the immune system for recruitment of protective responses. Infiltrating phagocytic monocytes and granulocytes are implicated in neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).","conclusion":"The increase in EAE severity normally seen from time of onset did not occur in mice receiving MIS416. This suppression of disease symptoms was dependent on expression of the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR). Transfer of intrathecal MIS416-induced neutrophils suppressed EAE in recipient mice, while monocytes did not transfer protection. MIS416-induced neutrophils showed increased IL-10 expression that was IFNAR1-driven. In contrast to intrathecal administration, intravenous administration of MIS416 led to monocyte but not neutrophil infiltration to the CNS.

Pathways and gene ontologies (GOs) over-represented in the resulting gene sets were calculated. Potential causal relationships between genes and between GOs were explored employing the Granger test of gene expression time series over the range of ages.","background":"Despite ongoing research efforts, mechanisms of brain aging are still enigmatic and need to be elucidated for a better understanding of age-associated cognitive decline. The aim of this study is to investigate aging in the prefrontal cortex region of human brain in a meta-analysis of transcriptome datasets.","conclusion":"The most outstanding results were the age-related decline of synaptic transmission and activated expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in both sexes. We found an antagonistic relationship between calcium\/calmodulin dependent protein kinase IV (CAMK4) and GFAP which may include regulatory mechanisms involving cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK, alias ERK). Common to both sexes was a decline in synaptic transmission, neurogenesis and an increased base-level of inflammatory and immune-related processes.

Muscle-specific knockout of Bicd2 results in a similar reduction in L4 ventral axons comparable to global Bicd2<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice. Rab6, a small GTPase required for the sorting of exocytic vesicles from the Trans Golgi Network to the plasma membrane is a major binding partner of BICD2.

Silencing of OSMR reversed the ANXA2-induced phenotype, and STAT3 knockdown reduced OSMR protein expression. Exposure of GBM cells to hypoxic conditions activated the ANXA2-STAT3-OSMR signaling axis. Mice bearing ANXA2-overexpressing GBM exhibited shorter survival times compared with control tumor-bearing mice, whereas OSMR knockdown increased the survival time and diminished ANXA2-mediated tumor invasion, angiogenesis, and growth.","background":"Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by extensive tumor cell invasion, angiogenesis, and proliferation.

Our results indicate that the ANXA2-STAT3-OSMR axis regulates malignant phenotypic changes and mesenchymal transition in GBM, suggesting that this axis is a promising therapeutic target to treat GBM aggressiveness."},{"method":"In experimental brain insults in rats, we show that abnormal mitoses that are not followed by cytokinesis are typical for reactive astrocytes. The pathology originates due to the inability of the cells to form normal mitotic spindles with subsequent metaphase chromosome congression, which, in turn may be due to shape constraints aggravated by cellular enlargement and to the accumulation of large amounts of cytosolic proteins.","background":"Although abnormal mitosis with disarranged metaphase chromosomes or many micronuclei in astrocytes (named \"Alzheimer I type astrocytes\" and later \"Creutzfeldt-Peters cells\") have been known for nearly 100&#x2009;years, the origin and mechanisms of this pathology remain elusive.","conclusion":"Many astrocytes escape from arrested mitosis by producing micronuclei.

Binding of these antibodies to AQP4 on astrocytes initiates damage to these cells, which culminates in the formation of large tissue destructive lesions in the central nervous system (CNS). Consequently, untreated patients may become permanently blind or paralyzed. Studies on the induction and breakage of tolerance to AQP4 could be of great benefit for NMOSD patients. So far, however, all attempts to create suitable animal models by active sensitization have failed.","conclusion":"Here we show that these mimotopes can induce the production of AQP4-reactive antibodies in Lewis rats. Hence, our results provide a conceptual framework for the formation of such antibodies in NMOSD patients, and aid to improve immunization strategies for the creation of animal models suitable for tolerance studies in this devastating disease."},{"method":"Our retrospective survey of 147 cadaveric pediatric human hippocampi identified identical morphological spectra of granule cell dispersion in both normal and seizure-affected brains. Moreover, sections across the entire antero-posterior axis of a control cadaveric hippocampus revealed repetitive occurrence of different morphologies of the granule cell layer - compact, focally disaggregated and bilaminar.","background":"Chronic epilepsy has been associated with hippocampal abnormalities like neuronal loss, gliosis and granule cell dispersion. The granule cell layer of a normal human hippocampal dentate gyrus is traditionally regarded as a compact neuron-dense layer. Histopathological studies of surgically resected or autopsied hippocampal samples primarily from temporal lobe epilepsy patients, as well as animal models of epilepsy, describe variable patterns of granule cell dispersion including focal cell clusters, broader thick segments, and bilamination or \"tram-tracking\". Although most studies have implicated granule cell dispersion as a specific feature of chronic epilepsy, very few \"non-seizure\" controls were included in these published investigations.","conclusion":"The results indicate that granule cell dispersion is within the spectrum of normal variation and not unique to patients with epilepsy.

In sum, this case report sheds light on the comparative biology of intracranial and metastatic meningioma.

It is well established that, in many cases, phenotypic heterogeneity of sCJD is under control of two determinants: the genotype at the methionine (M)\/valine (V) polymorphic codon 129 of the human prion protein gene and the type, 1 or 2, of the pathogenic and disease-related form of the prion protein, PrP<sup>D<\/sup>. However, this scenario fails to explain the existence of distinct heterozygous sCJDMV2 subtypes, where heterogeneity occurs without any variation of the 129 allotype and PrP<sup>D<\/sup> type. One of these subtypes, denoted sCJDMV2C, associated with PrP<sup>D<\/sup> type 2, is characterized by widespread spongiform degeneration of the cerebral cortex (C). The second variant, denoted sCJDMV2K, features prominent deposition of PrP<sup>D<\/sup> amyloid forming kuru type (K) plaques.","conclusion":"Consistent with this hypothesis, our data demonstrated a strong correlation of the MV2C and MV2K phenotypes with the relative populations of protease-resistant forms of the pathogenic prion proteins, resPrP<sup>D<\/sup>-129&#x2009;M and resPrP<sup>D<\/sup>-129&#x2009;V, where resPrP<sup>D<\/sup>-129&#x2009;M dominated in the sCJDMV2C variant and resPrP<sup>D<\/sup>-129&#x2009;V in the sCJDMV2K variant.

Pediatric NTRK-fused gliomas (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;13) typically involved NTRK2, ranged from low- to high-histologic grade, and demonstrated histologic overlap with desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma, pilocytic astrocytoma, ganglioglioma, and glioblastoma, among other entities, but they rarely matched with high confidence to known methylation class families or with each other; alterations involving ATRX, PTEN, and CDKN2A\/2B were present in a subset of cases. Adult NTRK-fused gliomas (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;22) typically involved NTRK1 and had predominantly high-grade histology; genetic alterations involving IDH1, ATRX, TP53, PTEN, TERT promoter, RB1, CDKN2A\/2B, NF1, and polysomy 7 were common. Unsupervised principal component analysis of methylation profiles demonstrated no obvious grouping by histologic grade, NTRK gene involved, or age group.

Although they are not represented in 2016 updated WHO classification of CNS tumors, their diagnostic recognition is important because of clinical consequences.","conclusion":"Altogether, 14 out of 187 (7.4%) high grade pediatric brain tumors were diagnosed with either of four new CNS categories. Histopathological examination of the tumors confirmed, that they demonstrate a spectrum of morphology mimicking other CNS high grade tumors. However, they also exhibit some suggestive histopathological and immunohistochemical features that allow for a presumptive diagnosis prior to molecular assessment. Clinical characteristics of patients corroborated with the previous findings for CNS EFT-CIC, CNS NB-FOXR2 and CNS HGNET-MN1 patients, with a favorable survival rate for the latter two groups. Among six CNS HGNET-BCOR patients, three patients are long term survivors, suggesting possible heterogeneity within this molecular category of tumors.

This defect is accompanied by subcellular transcriptome alterations in the axonal and somatodendritic compartment. The axonal localization of transcripts encoding components of the cytoskeleton, the translational machinery and transcripts involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism were particularly affected by loss of Tdp-43. Accordingly, we observed reduced protein synthesis and disturbed mitochondrial functions in axons of Tdp-43-depleted motoneurons.","background":"Protein inclusions containing the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 are a pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurodegenerative disorders. The loss of TDP-43 function that is associated with these inclusions affects post-transcriptional processing of RNAs in multiple ways including pre-mRNA splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport, modulation of mRNA stability and translation. In contrast, less is known about the role of TDP-43 in axonal RNA metabolism in motoneurons.","conclusion":"Treatment with nicotinamide rescued the axon growth defect associated with loss of Tdp-43.

Both previously reported and novel recurrent copy number variations and somatic pathogenic mutations in chromatin remodeling, DNA damage response and PI3K\/MAPK growth pathways were variably detected, either in multiple or isolated foci.

Upregulation of SMAD4, PAI-1, CD44, and c-SRC in multiple foci most likely contributed to invasiveness. This integrated comprehensive analysis revealed a complex spatiotemporal evolution in diffuse intrisic pontine glioma, recommending pontine and cerebellar biopsies for accurate populational genetic characterization, and delineated common signaling pathways and potential therapeutic targets.

A small percentage of meningiomas harbor somatic variants in the Hedgehog pathway, a conserved gene expression program that is essential for development and adult stem cell homeostasis. Hedgehog signals are transduced through primary cilia, and misactivation of the Hedgehog pathway is known to underlie cancer. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of Hedgehog signaling in meningioma are unknown.","conclusion":"Our results reveal that meningiomas of all grades can express primary cilia, but that cilia are less prevalent among anaplastic tumors. Moreover, we find that expression of Smoothened alleles that are oncogenic in other contexts fail to activate the Hedgehog transcriptional program or promote proliferation in primary meningioma cells. These data reveal that meningiomas can express the subcellular structure necessary for canonical Hedgehog signaling, but suggest that they do not transduce ciliary Hedgehog signals."},{"method":"We here report on a customized next generation sequencing (NGS)-based DNA panel assay that combines diagnostic and predictive testing and -as a comprehensive approach- allows for simultaneous single nucleotide variant (SNP) \/ small insertion\/deletion (InDel), copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) detection. We analyzed formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) DNA from a total of 104 patients with CNS tumors.

This repeat is thought to elicit toxicity through RNA mediated protein sequestration and repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation of dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs).","conclusion":"Greater toxicity correlated with a short and unstructured carboxyl terminus (C-terminus) in the glycine-arginine (GR) RAN protein reading frame. This change in C-terminal sequence triggered nuclear accumulation of all three RAN DPRs. A similar differential toxicity and dependence on the GR C-terminus was observed when repeats were expressed in rodent neurons. The presence of the native C-termini across all three reading frames was partly protective.

As expected from HEX enzymatic function requirements, overexpression in vivo of HEXA and B combined, but not either of the subunits expressed alone, increased HEX activity as evidenced by histochemical assays. Biochemically, such HEX gene expression resulted in increased conversion of GM2 to its breakdown product GM3. In a neurodegenerative model of overexpression of aSYN in rats, increasing HEX activity by AAV6 gene transfer in the substantia nigra reduced aSYN embedding in lipid compartments and rescued dopaminergic neurons from degeneration.","background":"Sandhoff disease (SD) is a lysosomal storage disease, caused by loss of &#x3b2;-hexosaminidase (HEX) activity resulting in the accumulation of ganglioside GM2.

Disruption of p53 results in a wide range of disorders including cancer, metabolic diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by protein aggregates that contribute to disease pathology. Although p53 is known to aggregate, its propensity to aggregate in AD has never been assessed. Moreover, AD neuropathology includes lethal cell cycle re-entry, excessive DNA damage, and abnormal cell death which are all controlled by p53.","conclusion":"Lastly, we demonstrate that in the presence of DNA damage, phosphorylated p53 is mislocalized outside the nucleus and p53-mediated DNA damage responders are significantly decreased in AD brain. Control brain shows a healthy DNA damage response, indicating a loss of nuclear p53 function in AD may be due to p53 aggregation and\/or interactions with tau oligomers.

It is uncertain if tau is directly responsible for these vascular changes by interacting directly with microvessels, and\/or if it contributes indirectly via neurodegeneration and concurrent neuronal loss and inflammation.","conclusion":"These data suggest that reduction of tau is insufficient to alter established microvascular complications including morphological alterations, enhanced expression of inflammatory genes involved in leukocyte adherence, and blood brain barrier compromise. These data imply that 1) soluble bioactive tau surprisingly accumulates at the blood brain barrier in human brain and in mouse models, and 2) the morphological and molecular phenotype of microvascular disturbance does not resolve with reduction of whole brain soluble tau.

Secondly, we investigated whether microstructural information from in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could reflect histological findings from human brain tissue samples. Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded human post-mortem brain tissue from nine fetuses and neonates with DS (15-39 gestational weeks (GW)) and nine euploid age-matched brains (18-39 GW). Radial glia markers CRYAB, HOPX, SOX2, GFAP and Vimentin were assessed in the Ventricular Zone, Subventricular Zone and Intermediate Zone. In vivo diffusion MRI was used to assess microstructure in these regions in one DS (21 GW) and one control (22 GW) fetal brain.","background":"Down syndrome (DS) occurs with triplication of human chromosome 21 and is associated with deviations in cortical development evidenced by simplified gyral appearance and reduced cortical surface area. Radial glia are neuronal and glial progenitors that also create a scaffolding structure essential for migrating neurons to reach cortical targets and therefore play a critical role in cortical development.","conclusion":"We found a significant reduction in radial glial progenitor SOX2 and subtle deviations in radial glia expression (GFAP and Vimentin) prior to 24 GW in DS. In vivo, fetal MRI demonstrates underlying radial projections consistent with immunohistopathology. Radial glial alterations may contribute to the subsequent simplified gyral patterns and decreased cortical volumes observed in the DS brain.

Significantly different inflammatory responses were seen in nGD brains when compared with SVNI brains: the inflammatory response in the nGD brains consisted of reactive astrocytes and microglia with no infiltrating macrophages, but the inflammatory response in the brains of SVNI-infected mice was characterized by infiltration of macrophages and altered activation of microglia and astrocytes.

This new model allows rigorous study of the initial location of Lewy pathology formation and propagation in the living brain, and strongly suggests that aggregation begins in axonal structures with retrograde propagation to the cell body. This model also shows expeditious development of alpha-synuclein pathology following induction with small, in vitro-generated alpha-synuclein pre-formed fibrils (PFFs), as well as accelerated cell death of inclusion-bearing cells.","background":"It is necessary to develop an understanding of the specific mechanisms involved in alpha-synuclein aggregation and propagation to develop disease modifying therapies for age-related synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies.","conclusion":"Using this model, we found that aggregated alpha-synuclein somatic inclusions developed first in neurons, but later showed a second wave of inclusion formation in astrocytes. Interestingly, astrocytes appear to survive much longer after inclusion formation than their neuronal counterparts. This model also allowed careful study of peripheral-to-central spread of Lewy pathology after PFF injection into the hind limb musculature. Our results clearly show evidence of progressive, retrograde trans-synaptic spread of Lewy pathology through known neuroanatomically connected pathways in the motor system.

Quantitative real-time PCR and immunocytochemical analysis revealed that microglia is the major CNS cell type that constitutively expresses TLR5. Using Tlr5<sup>-\/-<\/sup> mice and inhibitory TLR5 antibody we found that activation of TLR5 in microglial cells by its agonist flagellin, a principal protein component of bacterial flagella, triggers their release of distinct inflammatory molecules, regulates chemotaxis, and increases their phagocytic activity. Furthermore, while TLR5 activation does not affect tumor growth in an ex vivo GL261 glioma mouse model, it triggers microglial accumulation and neuronal apoptosis in the cerebral cortex in vivo. TLR5-mediated microglial function involves the PI3K\/Akt\/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway, as specific inhibitors of this signaling pathway abolish microglial activation.","background":"Microglia are the primary immune-competent cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and sense both pathogen- and host-derived factors through several receptor systems including the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family.

An Alzheimer's disease polygenic score was associated with neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles but not Lewy-related pathology, and was most strongly associated with an Alzheimer's pathological diagnosis. Our results indicate that an assessment of genetic risk may be useful to clinically distinguish between Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.

Paradoxically, although UBQLN1 overexpression reduced pathologic signatures of disease in P497S Tg mice, female mice had larger percentage of body weight loss than males, and this correlated with a corresponding lack of behavioral improvements in the females.

We further investigate therapeutic mechanisms of nilvadipine using its racemic properties.

Neuroinflammation may present a possible answer due to its central role both in acute brain injury and in chronic degenerative-like disorders.","conclusion":"All r-mTBI mice exhibited increased neuroinflammation and impaired cognitive performance and motor functions. Treatment with racemic nilvadipine mitigated the TBI-induced inflammatory response and significantly improved spatial memory, whereas (-)-enantiomer decreased microgliosis and improved spatial memory but failed to reduce the astroglial response to as much as the racemate.

R533* mutation impairs CTTNBP2 interaction with cortactin due to lack of the C-terminal proline-rich domain. Through an N-C terminal interaction, M120I mutation at the N-terminal region of CTTNBP2 also negatively influences cortactin interaction. D570Y mutation increases the association of CTTNBP2 with microtubule, resulting in a dendritic localization of CTTNBP2, consequently reducing the distribution of CTTNBP2 in dendritic spines and impairing the synaptic function of CTTNBP2.","background":"Abnormal synaptic formation and signaling is one of the key molecular features of autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

Interestingly, we observed that ectopic expression of human MATR3 strongly mitigates G4C2-mediated neurodegeneration in vivo. MATR3-mediated suppression of C9 toxicity was dependent on the RNA-binding domain of MATR3. Importantly, we found that expression of MATR3 reduced the levels of RAN-translation products in mammalian cells in an RNA-dependent manner.","background":"The most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a GGGGCC (G4C2) hexanucleotide repeat expansions in first intron of the C9orf72 gene. The accumulation of repetitive RNA sequences can mediate toxicity potentially through the formation of intranuclear RNA foci that sequester key RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), and non-ATG mediated translation into toxic dipeptide protein repeats.

Administration of only five daily doses of bexarotene after completion of cisplatin treatment was sufficient to normalize myelin density and fiber coherency and to restore myelin compaction in cingulate and sensorimotor cortex. Functionally, bexarotene normalized performance of cisplatin-treated mice in tests for cognitive and sensorimotor function.

We found high levels of soluble OMGP in human spinal fluid, presumably due to shedding of the GPI-linked OMGP.

In addition, in vivo interstitial levels of anterior pituitary AVP, GRP and NMB (but not CRH) were elevated following chronic stressor exposure.","background":"Repeated exposure to stressors was reported to increase the expression of arginine-vasopressin (AVP), especially in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons co-expressing AVP, within the hypothalamus. This may increase the potential for subsequent stressor-elicited enhancement of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) functioning as these peptides synergistically stimulate pituitary ACTH secretion. Likewise, members of the bombesin (BB) family of peptides (including its mammalian analogues gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and neuromedin B (NMB)) stimulate the release of ACTH and may play a role in the mediation and\/or modulation of the CRH stress response.","conclusion":"Basal pituitary corticosterone levels, in contrast, were unaffected by chronic stressor exposure. Following consumption of a highly palatable snack, interstitial levels of CRH, GRP, NMB and corticosterone (but not AVP) were elevated at the pituitary; however, a cross-sensitization was not apparent among rats previously exposed to the stressor and then provided with the snack. As the CRH, AVP and BB-like peptide systems have been associated with altered anxiety and depressive symptoms, the sustained peptidergic alterations observed in the chronically stressed rats may have implications for the development of these stressor-related disorders."},{"method":"In this study we used a novel analysis of sleep to examine the effects of alcohol on sleep patterns in rats. This analysis separates waking into multiple components and defines a period labeled vigilance cycling (VC) in which the rat rapidly cycles through various vigilance states. These VC episodes are separated by long duration wake (LDW) periods. We find that 6 weeks of alcohol (6% in a liquid diet) caused fragmentation of extended VC episodes that normally occur in the light period.","background":"Studies have shown that disturbed sleep produced by chronic alcohol abuse in humans can predict relapse drinking after periods of abstinence. How alcohol produces disturbed sleep remains unknown.","conclusion":"However, total daily amounts of slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid-eye movement sleep (REMS) remained constant. The daily amount of wake, SWS, and REMS remained constant because the alcohol treated rats increased the amount of VC in the dark period, and the sleep nature of VC in the dark period became more intense. In addition, we observed more wake and less REMS early in the light period in alcohol treated rats. All effects completely reversed by day 16 of alcohol withdrawal. Comparison of the effects of chronic alcohol to acute alcohol exposure demonstrated the effects of chronic alcohol are due to adaptation and not the acute presence of alcohol. The effects of chronic alcohol treatment in rats mimic the effects reported in humans (REMS suppression, difficulty falling asleep, and difficulty remaining asleep)."},{"method":"Using lesion, electrophysiological and immunocytochemical techniques, separate neural pathways underlying recognition of individual odors and guidance of sex-typical responses to opposite-sex odors have been identified in both male and female hamsters.","background":"Recognizing the individual and sexual identities of conspecifics is critical for adaptive social behavior and, in most mammals this information is communicated primarily by chemosensory cues. Due to its heavy reliance on odor cues, we have used the Syrian hamster as our model species for investigating the neural regulation of social recognition.","conclusion":"Specifically, we have found that recognition of individual odor identity requires olfactory bulb connections to entorhinal cortex (ENT) rather than other chemoreceptive brain regions. This kind of social memory does not appear to require the hippocampus and may, instead, depend on ENT connections with piriform cortex. In contrast, sexual recognition, through either differential investigation or scent marking toward opposite-sex odors, depends on both olfactory and vomeronasal system input to the corticomedial amygdala. Preference for investigating opposite-sex odors requires primarily olfactory input to the medial amygdala (ME) whereas appropriately targeted scent marking responses require vomeronasal input to ME as well as to other structures. Within the ME, the anterior section (MEa) appears important for evaluating or classifying social odors whereas the posterodorsal region (MEpd) may be more involved in generating approach to social odors. Evidence is presented that analysis of social odors may initially be done in MEa and then communicated to MEpd, perhaps through micro-circuits that separately process male and female odors."},{"method":"Recent data provide evidence that different cognitive strategies (cue-outcome associations) and neural systems (amygdala) are used when subjects are trained under conditions that allow Pavlovian-induced reward expectancies to guide instrumental behavioral choices. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that impairments typically observed in a number of brain-damaged models are alleviated or eliminated by embedding unique reward expectancies into learning\/memory tasks.","background":"The capacity to seek and obtain rewards is essential for survival. Pavlovian conditioning is one mechanism by which organisms develop predictions about rewards and such anticipatory or expectancy states enable successful behavioral adaptations to environmental demands. Reward expectancies have both affective\/motivational and discriminative properties that allow for the modulation of instrumental goal-directed behavior.","conclusion":"These results suggest that Pavlovian-induced reward expectancies can change both behavioral and brain processes."},{"method":"C57BL\/6J and CD1 male mice were used in the experiments. During the acquisition phase, learning was measured using parameters latency, path length, errors in the BM and correct decisions in MTM. Mice were trained for 4 days and probe trials were performed on days 5 and 12.","background":"Evaluation of spatial learning and memory is mainly carried out using the Morris water maze as a single paradigm. We intended to test whether mice in the Barnes maze and Multiple T-maze would lead to comparable results and to test two individual mouse strains with different anxiety levels.","conclusion":"Latencies reduction over the training period indicated that both strains learned all tasks. During retention phase at days 5 and 12 C57BL\/6J performed the Barnes maze and Multiple T-maze task better than CD1 mice while CD1 performed better than C57BL\/6J in the Morris water maze. In the BM at day 12, C57BL\/6J kept the level of visits to target observed at day 5 whereas CD1 performed worse. Strain- and task-dependent differences were observed using the three mazes. Therefore, fair evaluation of spatial memory demands application of (at least) two different test systems, a water- and a land maze. Different anxiety-related behaviour as well as stress-responses in the strains used may help to interpret the findings reported and again may propose the use of at least two mouse strains when robust evaluation of spatial memory is considered."},{"method":"Cross-fostering was performed from postnatal day 7 for 3 weeks. Mice were divided into three groups: (1) biological group: pups born from ICR dams fostered by their original mothers; (2) in-foster group: pups born from ICR dams but adopted by other ICR dams and (3) cross-foster group: ICR pups adopted by C57 dams. ICR mice were subjected to behavioral experiments at the age of 8 weeks.","background":"Early-life stress during the postnatal period could precipitate long-lasting alterations in the functional properties underlying emotional expression in humans, but how the psychological stress of cross-fostering affects emotional behavior during adulthood in mice remains primarily unknown. The purpose of the present study was to examine the long-term effects of cross-fostering on the emotional behavior and cognitive functions of ICR offspring in adulthood.","conclusion":"Emotional behaviors in the cross-fostered mice were significantly altered in the open-field, elevated plus maze and forced swimming tests, as well as social interaction tests. However, the cross-fostered mice showed normal memory function in the Y-maze and novel object recognition tests. The contents of serotonin metabolisms were decreased in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus indicated the deficit of serotoninergic neuronal function by cross-fostering. These findings suggested that the early-life stress of cross-fostering induced long-lasting emotional abnormalities, which might be possibly related to alterations of serotonin metabolisms."},{"method":"The tasks included simple thumb tapping (sTT), handwriting (HW) and finger-to-thumb opposition sequence (FOS) learning.","background":"We investigated gender differences in motor performance in 9-, 12-, and 17-year-olds.","conclusion":"In sTT there was a significant advantage for the 17-year-old males. In HW, 12-year-old females were faster, initially, than the males, but this gap was closed by a single training session; in the 17-year-olds although no significant difference was found initially, the males became faster than the age-matched females post-training. In the FOS, there were no initial gender differences (speed or accuracy). However, males benefited more from training, with the 17-year-old males attaining a significant post-training speed advantage. Moreover, males, of all three age-groups, evolved significantly larger delayed (\"off-line\") performance gains in the FOS task compared to females; gains which were retained 6-weeks post-training. There may be a male advantage in motor learning rather than in motor performance per-se; this advantage is enhanced during adolescence."},{"method":"The aims of this fMRI study were (1) to examine the effects of food deprivation and calorie content on reward processing in the amygdala and the OFC, and (2) to examine whether an explicit evaluation of foods is necessary for OFC, but not amygdalar activity. Addressing the first aim, healthy females were presented with high and low calorie food pictures while being either hungry or satiated. For the second aim, attention focus was manipulated by directing participants' attention either to the food or to a neutral aspect.","background":"Research indicates that dysfunctional food reward processing may contribute to pathological eating behaviour. It is widely recognized that both the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are essential parts of the brain's reward circuitry.","conclusion":"This study shows that hunger interacts with the energy content of foods, modulating activity in the posterior cingulate cortex, medial OFC, insula, caudate putamen and fusiform gyrus. Results show that satiated healthy females show an increased reward processing in response to low calorie foods. Confirming our hypothesis, food deprivation increased activity following the presentation of high calorie foods, which may explain why treatments of obesity energy restricting diets often are unsuccessful. Interestingly, activity in both the amygdala and mOFC was only evident when participants explicitly evaluated foods. However, attention independent activity was found in the mPFC following the high calorie foods cues when participants where hungry. Current findings indicate that research on how attention modulates food reward processing might prove especially insightful in the study of the neural substrates of healthy and pathological eating behaviour."},{"method":"The present study was designed to evaluate the role of the RE in acquisition, consolidation and retrieval of spatial reference memory (RM) and working memory (WM). We assessed the effect of reversible inactivation of RE with tetracaine (0.5 microl, 2%) on different stages of memory. Rats were trained on RM and WM versions of the Morris water maze (MWM) task. RE was inactivated before or immediately after training or before the probe trial of retrieval tests.","background":"The involvement of thalamic midline nuclei (MLN) in early stage of Alzheimer's disease and in diencephalic amnesia has drawn attention to the connectivity between the nucleus reuniens (RE) and structures of medial temporal lobe. RE is major source of thalamic afferents to the hippocampus and has been shown to exert powerful excitatory action on CA1 of hippocampus, which is supposed to be involved in learning and memory processes. However, the role of the RE on spatial memory is a controversial issue.","conclusion":"The data showed that reversible inactivation of the RE significantly impaired both RM and WM versions of MWM. Therefore, it seems that nucleus reuniens of thalamus plays a role in spatial RM and WM version of the MWM task in rats."},{"method":"Here we test this prediction by training pigeons on a simple color-discrimination task with two pairs of colors. In each pair, correct discrimination is rewarded; in pair one with a large-reward, in pair two with a small-reward.","background":"Modern theoretical accounts on reward-based learning are commonly based on reinforcement learning algorithms. Most noted in this context is the temporal-difference (TD) algorithm in which the difference between predicted and obtained reward, the prediction-error, serves as a learning signal. Consequently, larger rewards cause bigger prediction-errors and lead to faster learning than smaller rewards. Therefore, if animals employ a neural implementation of TD learning, reward-magnitude should affect learning in animals accordingly.","conclusion":"Pigeons acquired the 'large-reward' discrimination faster than the 'small-reward' discrimination. Animal behavior and an implementation of the TD-algorithm yielded comparable results with respect to the difference between learning curves in the large-reward and in the small-reward conditions. We conclude that the influence of reward-magnitude on the acquisition of a simple discrimination paradigm is accurately reflected by a TD implementation of reinforcement learning."},{"method":"About 70% of rats exposed to 7 weeks of chronic mild stress showed a gradual reduction in consumption of a sucrose solution, indicating an anhedonic-like state. The remaining rats did not reduce their sucrose intake, but appeared resilient to the stress-induced effects on sucrose intake. Cognitive profiling of the CMS rats revealed that chronic stress had a negative effect on performance in the spontaneous alternation test, possibly reflecting a deficit in working memory.","background":"The chronic mild stress (CMS) protocol is widely used to evoke depressive-like behaviours in laboratory rats. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of chronic stress on cognitive performance.","conclusion":"This effect was independent of whether the stressed rats were anhedonic-like or stress-resilient as measured by their sucrose intake. CMS did not influence performance in passive avoidance and auditory cued fear conditioning, however, in rats displaying an anhedonic-like profile, CMS increased freezing behaviour in contextual fear conditioning."},{"method":"We here tested the effect of systemic and local blockade of DA D1- and D2-receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) by using an operant paradigm, where rats have to adjust their behavior to changing reward value. Rats were trained in a Skinner box, where different numbers of lever-presses for pellet-rewards were assigned to and switched between two levers. After rats commit to the efficient lever the lever-occupancy reversed and rats had to switch to the now efficient one. Rats were either intraperitoneally injected with the DA D1-receptor antagonist SCH23390 (40 microg\/kg), the DA D2-receptor antagonist sulpiride (10mg\/kg), or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Two other groups received bilateral local mPFC- or OFC-infusions of SCH23390, sulpiride (both 3 microg\/0.5 microl), or PBS (0.5 microl) through previously implanted cannulae.","background":"Prefrontocortical dopamine (DA) plays an essential role in the representation of reward value and is implicated in behavioral flexibility.","conclusion":"After initial detection of reverse of lever-occupancy, systemic and local blockade of D1-receptors increased the number of switches back to the previously efficient lever, thus reducing the total number of reverses completed. D2-receptor blockade deteriorated this measure after local mPFC-infusion. Notably, initial detection of reverse of lever-occupancy was not affected. Blockade of DA receptors within the prefrontal cortex do not deteriorate the detection of changes in reward value, whereas maintenance of behavioral adaptation is disturbed. Interestingly, blockade of DA receptors in the mPFC and OFC had similar effects, i.e., these regions apparently act in a cooperative manner."},{"method":"Control subjects showed higher face related activations in the right compared to the left FFA. Caricatures of faces of famous people and photographs of non-famous faces yielded higher percent signal changes in the OFA and FFA compared to photographs of famous faces.","background":"The aim of the present study was to further explore the neuronal mechanisms of face processing in healthy subjects which may help to understand the difficulties experienced by prosopagnosia subjects. A further goal was to compare face specific activation patterns in the right and left occipital face area (OFA) and fusiform face area (FFA) for famous faces, non-famous faces and caricatures of famous faces in four individuals suffering from developmental prosopagnosia (DP) and seven healthy controls, using functional magnetic resonance imaging and psychophysiological interaction analysis (PPI).","conclusion":"These data support the idea that the OFA and FFA discriminate between familiar and new face representations. The activation patterns of DP subjects were heterogeneous, with none of the patients showing bilateral face related activations in both OFA and FFA. There was no evidence of a left hemispheric activation when the right homologue failed to be activated, supporting the view of a right hemispheric dominance in face perception. PPI analysis indicated a link between activation of the right FFA and the other three tested regions, the left FFA and the right and left OFA. In summary, all four face related brain regions appear to be necessary for successful face processing, and disruption of one component may lead to face recognition deficits."},{"method":"In addition, serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite (5-HIAA), serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) and tryptophan hydroxylase enzyme (TPH) were measured at the end of the study and correlated to the task performances.

The purpose of the current study was to compare the effects of transient high levels of endogenous estrogen and chronic exogenous estrogen treatment on the anxiety-like behaviors using the elevated T-maze (ETM) test.","conclusion":"In the ETM test, the Ovx+E(2) group had reduced inhibitory avoidance responses compared to others, suggesting that exogenous E(2) replacement is anxiolytic, while escape latency was prolonged in the Sham-Pro group suggesting endogenous E(2) is panicolytic. Further, the serotonin turnover rate (5-HIAA\/5-HT ratio) in the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens was highest in the Ovx+E(2) group. While the TPH protein in the midbrain of Ovx rats was significantly higher than others, the SERT levels were not significantly different among groups in all measured brain areas. In conclusion, Ovx rats with chronic estrogen administration and Sham-Pro rats with naturally high levels of estrogen, demonstrated anxiolytic behavior by exhibiting different forms of anxiety that related to the changes in the function of serotonergic system."},{"method":"The neurogenic status, measured by doublecortin (DCX) expression, showed an important decline in the number of positive cells in the subgranular zone (SGZ). However, neuronal migration was not affected. We found a marked enhancement of intracellular lipofuscin deposits, characteristic of increased oxidative stress and aging in both, the hilus and the SGZ and granular cell layer (GCL). Diabetic mice showed a significant impairment in learning and memory tests, exhibiting a higher latency to show an escape response and a poorer learning efficiency of an active avoiding response compared with control mice. Both, exploratory and non-exploratory activities in a conflictive environment in the asymmetric elevated plus maze were not affected by the diabetic condition.","background":"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is accompanied by a \"diabetic encephalopathy\" including hypersensitivity to stress, increased risk of stroke, dementia and cognitive impairment.

The aim of this study was to explore in streptozotocin-treated mice and other parameters associated to mild neurodegeneration in the dentate gyrus and the potential correlation with behavioural changes.","conclusion":"In conclusion, experimental diabetes showed clear signs of changes in the dentate gyrus, changes similar to those present in the aging process. Correlatively, these alterations were in line with a reduced performance in learning and memory tests. The mechanism that could potentially link neural and behavioural disturbances is not yet fully comprehended."},{"method":"Bacterial collagenase (or sterile saline for SHAM surgery) was injected into the striatum to create an ICH. Two days later, functional deficits were assessed using a neurological deficit scale (NDS), which is most sensitive to ICH injury. Sensory and\/or motor deficits may confound cognitive testing; thus, we waited until these had resolved before testing learning and memory. Testing was conducted 1-7 months after ICH and included spontaneous alternation, elevated plus maze, open-field, Morris water maze, T-maze (win-shift and win-stay paradigms), and the radial arm maze (eight and four arms baited protocols).","background":"Preclinical studies must rigorously assess whether putative therapies improve motor and cognitive function following brain injury. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) causes significant sensory-motor and cognitive deficits in humans. However, no study has evaluated cognition in rodent ICH models. Thus, we used a battery of tests to comprehensively examine whether a striatal ICH causes cognitive impairments in rats.","conclusion":"Significant motor deficits at 2 days completely resolved by 1 month, at which time cognitive testing began. In contrast to persistent cognitive deficits that occur after ICH in humans, we did not detect significant learning or memory deficits after ICH in rats. Our results suggest that these tests will not likely be useful for assessing outcome in experimental ICH studies. In conclusion, animal models that better mimic clinical ICH (both motor and cognitive deficits) must be developed. This may include increasing ICH severity or injuring other functional subdivisions within the striatum that may lead to more profound cognitive deficits."},{"method":"We performed a behavioural phenotyping on SV2A (+\/-) mice in a battery of tests: gross behavioural observation, spontaneous locomotor activity, sensori-motor coordination, acute pain sensitivity, exploration in an elevated plus-maze and an assessment of learning abilities in an inhibitory avoidance procedure. SV2A (+\/-) mice were compared to age-matched, 2-month-old wild type controls.","background":"Synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) is involved in neurotransmitter release and has been identified as the binding site for levetiracetam (Keppra), a novel antiepileptic drug.

In contrast, heterozygous SV2A (+\/-) mice have a normal lifespan.","conclusion":"Overall, gross behaviour, spontaneous locomotor activity, sensori-motor coordination and acute pain sensitivity were comparable between wild type and SV2A (+\/-) mice. When tested in a plus-maze, SV2A (+\/-) mice displayed significant increased avoidance of open elevated arms whereas locomotor activity was not altered. Finally, both SV2A (+\/-) and wild type mice showed comparable memory performance at the end of a multi-trial passive avoidance procedure. Interestingly, SV2A (+\/-) mice exhibited increased avoidance of the lit area during the first sessions without foot shock. These results suggest an anxiety-like phenotype for SV2A (+\/-) mice indicated by increased open-arm avoidance in the elevated plus-maze test as well as a shorter latency to escape from a lit area in the inhibitory avoidance procedure."},{"method":"Thus, prepuberal rats were given, for two weeks daily, an i.p. injection of D-Asp or DEE or vehicle.

Responses during presentation of the two S+ stimuli and non-responding during presentation of the two S- stimuli were followed by reward. We recorded from two pigeons at different learning stages.","background":"Forebrain association areas interweave perceived stimuli with acquired representations of own actions and their outcome. Often, relevant stimuli come in a bewildering variety of shapes and sizes and we slowly have to learn to group them into meaningful categories. Therefore, the aim of the present study was twofold: First, to reveal how single units in the pigeon's nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), a functional analogue of the mammalian prefrontal cortex (PFC), encode stimuli that differ in visual features but not in behavioral relevance. The second aim was to understand how these categorical representations are established during learning.","conclusion":"In the beginning of the learning process, neurons were active during and shortly before reward, but only in go trials. These data suggest that during the early phase of learning avian 'prefrontal' neurons code for rewards associated with the same behavioral demand, while ignoring feature differences of stimuli within one category. When learning progressed, (1) category selectivity became stronger, (2) responses selective for nogo stimuli appeared, and (3) reward-related responses disappeared in favor of category-selective responses during the stimulus phase. This backward shift in time resembles response patterns assumed by the temporal difference (TD) model of reinforcement learning, but goes beyond it, since it reflects the neuronal correlate of functional categories."},{"method":"Subjects were 10 non-deprived adult male Lister hooded rats, tested with 0.5-3.0 mg\/kg sibutramine hydrochloride during 1-h DVD-recorded test sessions with palatable mash.","background":"The serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor sibutramine has been licensed as an anti-obesity treatment for more than a decade. However, while inhibitory effects on food intake and weight gain are well documented, surprisingly little published detail exists regarding its influence on feeding and related behaviours.

Ethological analysis revealed very few behavioural effects, except for a dose-dependent reduction in time spent feeding and an increase in the frequency of resting. Behavioural specificity was further supported by time-bin analysis which confirmed both the structural integrity and dose-dependent acceleration of the BSS. Single dosing with sibutramine (3.0 mg\/kg) also suppressed daily weight gain over the 24-72 h period post-dosing. Current data support the conclusion that the acute anorectic and weight loss efficacy of sibutramine in adult male rats is not secondary to behavioural disruption but, instead, is due largely to an acceleration in behavioural satiety."},{"method":"Evaluation of rodent learning and memory was assessed by a step-through test on day 6 after a double training and an initial acquisition trial on day 5.

PrB extract administration also resulted in reduced lipid peroxidation products (38 and 79%) and higher brain ascorbic acid levels (21 and 64%) in both PrB30 and PrB60-treated groups, respectively, and higher glutathione levels (28%) in the PrB60-treated group. Furthermore, salt- and detergent soluble AChE activity significantly decreased in both PrB-treated groups. Thus, the significant cognitive enhancement observed in adult mice after short-term i.p. supplementation with the blueberry extract concentrated in polyphenols, is closely related to higher brain antioxidant properties and inhibition of AChE activity. These findings stress the critical impact of wild blueberry bioactive components on brain function."},{"method":"For example, both striatal and hippocampal neural representations reflect spatial location, directional heading, reward, and egocentric movement features of a test situation in an experience-dependent way, and independent of task demands.","background":"The striatum has long been considered to be selectively important for nondeclarative, procedural types of memory. This stands in contrast with spatial context processing that is typically attributed to hippocampus. Neurophysiological evidence from studies of the neural mechanisms of adaptive navigation reveals that distinct neural systems such as the striatum and hippocampus continuously process task relevant information regardless of the current cognitive strategy.","conclusion":"Thus, continual parallel processing across memory systems may be the norm rather than the exception. It is suggested that neuromodulators, such as dopamine, may serve to differentially regulate learning-induced neural plasticity mechanisms within these memory systems such that the most successful form of neural processing exerts the strongest control over response selection functions. In this way, dopamine may serve to optimize behavioral choices in the face of changing environmental demands during navigation."},{"method":"In this work, two experimental models were used, one Type B HE (portacaval shunt) and the other Type C HE (cirrhosis by intoxication with thioacetamide), to evaluate its effect on two tasks of associative learning: two-way active avoidance and step-through passive avoidance.","background":"People with hepatic insufficiency can develop hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a complex neuropsychological syndrome covering a wide range of neurological and cognitive and motor alterations.

For this reason, experimental models of HE are used to study this condition.","conclusion":"The results show an impediment both in acquisition and retention of active avoidance in both models of HE. However, in passive avoidance, only the rats with portacaval shunt presented a memory deficit for the aversive event. In our opinion, these results can be explained by alterations in the neurotransmission system presented by animals with hepatic insufficiency, which are mainly caused by a rise in cerebral histamine and a dysfunction of the glutamatergic system."},{"method":"Treatment of Sprague-Dawley rats and C57Bl\/6 mice with 2-cyclohexene-1-one (CHX) dose-dependently reduced striatal and frontal cortical GSH levels similar to those in schizophrenia.","background":"Oxidative stress and reduced brain glutathione (GSH) levels have been reported in psychiatric illnesses including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

However, the SAH group did show a minor cognitive impairment in the Morris water task. In addition, SAH produced a slight, but significant elevation in body temperature (vs. sham operated rats) despite an acute decrease in general home cage activity. The majority of the animals did not have any observable infarcts and the SAH did not significantly affect cortical thickness. In summary, the endovascular perforation model of SAH results in no lasting motor deficits and only minor cognitive impairment in survivors, which alone would be difficult to evaluate in neuroprotection or rehabilitation studies."},{"method":"The aim of our study was to examine whether the SP microinjected into the GP or central nucleus of AMY (ACE) can modify negative reinforcement.

Prior treatment with WIN51,708 could block the SP effects on passive avoidance paradigm. Our results are the first to demonstrate that SP plays important roles, though in different ways, in learning and memory processes related to the GP and AMY."},{"method":"In a sample of 89 student subjects, a 'cognitive' and an 'emotional' Stroop paradigm were applied to measure processing of cognitive and affective conflicts.","background":"Evidence suggests that a promoter polymorphism of the tryptophan-hydroxylase 2 gene (TPH2 -703 G\/T) is associated with executive control functions. The current study aimed to clarify whether this relation is restricted to a purely cognitive domain or whether such an effect can also be observed in the processing of emotional material.","conclusion":"Our results suggest an impact of the TPH2 -703 G\/T polymorphism on executive control in both, the cognitive as well as the emotional task. In detail, homozygous carriers of the T allele showed decelerated responses in low-conflict conditions, pointing to a rather abnormal functioning of higher-order control mechanisms. Thus, the present investigation is consistent with previous behavioural studies and adds further evidence for the impact of serotonin at the interface of cognition and emotion."},{"method":"In the present study, we examined the effect of CRF on attentional function using a five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) in rats. Accuracy in the 5-CSRTT was used as the index of attentional function. Human\/rat CRF was intracerebroventricularly injected (0, 0.01, 0.1, or 1 microg\/5 microl saline) 20 min before the beginning of the test trial in male Lister hooded rats that generally show high performance in the 5-CSRTT.","background":"Previous studies have shown that psychological stress affects attentional function, and corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is closely related to stress responses.","conclusion":"As a result, 0.1 microg of CRF, but not other doses of CRF, increased accuracy in the 5-CSRTT. However, 0.1 microg of CRF did not affect impulsivity, motivation\/appetite, perseverative tendency, or motor function. Even when Wistar rats, which generally show poor performance in the 5-CSRTT were used, 0.1 microg of CRF increased accuracy in the 5-CSRTT. However, the effect of CRF was not significantly attenuated by intracerebroventricular injection of the CRF(1) receptor antagonist antalarmin (5 microg). These results showed that CRF selectively enhances attentional function regardless of baseline attentional performance and rat strain, but this effect may be due to the pathways other than CRF(1) receptors. The present results suggest that CRF is involved in stress-related changes of attention and indicate that moderate stress, but not severe stress, may enhance attentional performance. Furthermore, these findings also indicate that the CRF-related substance could be a target for the development of an agent to improve attentional function."},{"method":"To determine the role of the basal ganglia in this phenomenon, we used in situ hybridization to measure the expression of c-fos mRNA, a marker for neural activation, in the brains of tolerant and nontolerant rats. Rats given chronic amphetamine injections prior to food access learned to suppress stereotyped movements, whereas yoked controls given the drug after feeding did not.","background":"Tolerance to the hypophagic effect of psychostimulants is contingent on having access to food while intoxicated. Rats given chronic injections of such drugs with access to food learn to suppress stereotyped movements, which interfere with feeding. In contrast, controls given the drug after food access do not learn to suppress stereotypy and, therefore, do not become tolerant.","conclusion":"Following an acute injection of amphetamine, both of these groups had higher levels of c-fos mRNA than saline-treated controls throughout the striatum, in the nucleus accumbens core, the ventral pallidum and layers V-VI of the motor cortex. In contrast, tolerant rats, which had learned to suppress stereotypy, had higher levels of c-fos mRNA than both amphetamine- and saline-treated controls in the entopeduncular nucleus, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, pedunculopontine nucleus, nucleus accumbens shell, olfactory tubercle, somatosensory cortex, and layers II-IV of motor cortex. These data suggest that the learned suppression of amphetamine-induced stereotypy involves the activation of dorsal striatal pathways previously implicated in response selection as well as the ventral striatum, long implicated in appetitive motivation and reinforcement."},{"method":"In the present research, male C57BL\/6J mice were systemically administered the inflammatory bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) alone or in combination and the behavior as well as striatal dopamine levels were compared to saline-treated mice.","background":"In most environmental models of Parkinson's disease (PD), a single neurodegenerative agent is introduced to cause nigrostriatal dopamine depletion. However, cell loss in human PD often might derive, at least in part, from multiple toxins or vulnerabilities, any one of which alone does not inevitably lead to chronic dopamine depletion.","conclusion":"Mice in the combination (LPS+MPTP) group, but not in the single-factor groups, showed both dopamine depletion and parkinsonian symptoms, i.e., reduced stride length, at 4 months post-injection. MPTP alone acutely reduced striatal dopamine levels but this effect was transient as striatal dopamine recovered to normal levels after time (4 months). The LPS-only group showed no dopamine depletion or reduced stride length. These data are consistent with the view that nigrostriatal dopamine neurons might succumb after time to multiple toxic agents that independently may have only a transient, adverse effect."},{"method":"Thus, prepuberal NHE and NRB rats were daily handled in the 5th and 6th week of postnatal life. Then rats were exposed to two spatial novelties i.e. a L&#xe0;t and a Olton maze for 10 min. Amino acids were detected by HPLC in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), striatum (STR), hippocampus (HPC) and hypothalamus (HYP).","background":"The Naples high-excitability (NHE) rats are thought to model the mesocortical variant of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The aim of this study was to investigate forebrain level of L-glutamate, L-aspartate and D-aspartate, in NHE vs. Naples random bred (NRB) control rats.","conclusion":"Results indicate that all amino acids were higher in NHE than in NRB rats. This, in turn, may explain the behavioural hyperactivity and attention deficit of this animal model of ADHD."},{"method":"In the present study, the effects of reversible inactivation of VTA on acquisition and expression of morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) were investigated in rats. One hundred and eighty-one adult male albino Wistar rats were used in these experiments. Reversible inactivation of VTA was done through the unilateral and bilateral intra-VTA microinjection of 2% lidocaine during the acquisition and expression of morphine (5 mg\/kg; s.c.)-induced CPP. Animal displacement, conditioning score and locomotor activity were recorded by Ethovision software.","background":"The mesolimbic dopaminergic system that projects from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens is critical for initiation of opioid reinforcement and reward-related effects of drugs of abuse.","conclusion":"The results showed that bilateral but not unilateral intra-VTA administration of lidocaine significantly decreases the acquisition (P&lt;0.01) and expression (P&lt;0.05) of morphine-induced CPP compared to their respective saline-microinjected groups. Moreover, intra-VTA administration of lidocaine had no effect on locomotor activity in these experiments. Our results further support the idea that VTA may play an important role in the acquisition of morphine-induced CPP. In addition, there is no functional lateralization in the VTA for acquisition and\/or expression of morphine-induced CPP in the rat."},{"method":"Here, we studied the CS control of wrist muscles during expectation of an imposed wrist extension. Subjects were instructed either to compensate (COMP) the perturbation (applied at variable delays) or not to intervene (NINT). In a quarter of all trials at random, in the time window when perturbation might occur, TMS was applied over contralateral M1. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were measured in the FCR (flexor carpi radialis) and ECR (extensor carpi radialis) muscles, as well as the silent period (SP) in the FCR.","background":"Voluntary movement is often perturbed by the external forces in the environment. Because corticospinal (CS) control of wrist muscles during preparation of voluntary movement has been extensively studied without variation in the external forces, very little is known about the way CS control adapts when subjects expect motor perturbations.","conclusion":"Following the perturbation, we found a larger long-latency stretch reflex in COMP than in NINT. During the expectation of the perturbation, MEP amplitudes did not differ across conditions in FCR. However, those evoked in ECR were greater in COMP than in NINT condition. Moreover in the FCR, the silent period lasted longer in NINT. Thus, we showed a selective effect of the prepared reaction on the anticipatory tuning of CS excitability and cortical inhibition in the agonist\/antagonist muscles. This tuning clearly differed from the tuning during voluntary movement preparation without variation in the external forces. This shows that the tuning of the CS system during motor preparation depends on the dynamical context of movement production."},{"method":"Rats were trained to lever press under a 5-component fixed-ratio (5, 15, 30, 60, and 100) schedule of food reinforcement. Rats were tested for 15 days prior to dopamine lesions and again for 15 days post-lesion. To characterize functional loss relative to lesion size, rats were grouped according to the extent and the degree of lateralization of their dopamine loss.","background":"Mathematical principles of reinforcement (MPR; Killeen, 1994) is a quantitative model of operant behavior that contains three parameters representing motor capacity (delta), motivation (a), and short term memory (lambda). The present study applied MPR to characterize the effects of bilateral infusions of 6-OHDA into the substantia nigra pars compacta in the rat, a model of Parkinson's disease.","conclusion":"Response rates decreased as a function of dopamine depletion, primarily at intermediate ratios. MPR accounted for 98% of variance in pre- and post-lesion response rates. Consistent with reported disruptions in motor behavior induced by dopaminergic lesions, estimates of delta increased when dopamine was severely depleted. There was no support for different estimates of a based on pre- and post-lesion performance of any lesion group, suggesting that dopamine loss has negligible effects on incentive motivation. The present study demonstrates the usefulness of combining operant techniques with a theoretical model to better understand the effects of a neurochemical manipulation."},{"method":"Using torque motor-driven manipulanda, 11 blindfolded, right-handed adults experienced triangular velocity profiles at 2 different peak speeds (30 degrees \/s or 60 degrees \/s) with the preferred and non-preferred elbow. Subjects then matched the dynamics of these target movements with either the same (ipsilateral remembered) or opposite (contralateral remembered) elbow.","background":"Although proprioception consists of static (i.e. position) and dynamic (i.e. movement) components, most studies regarding the matching of proprioceptive targets have focused only on position. Further, these position-matching studies have recently indicated that proprioceptive ability is influenced by several factors including task difficulty and arm preference. The purpose of the present study, therefore, was to quantify the matching of dynamic proprioceptive target arm movements under different matching conditions.","conclusion":"Matching errors were generally larger for the more difficult, contralateral remembered versus ipsilateral remembered task, and for greater target speed conditions. One arm difference was found indicating a non-preferred arm advantage for the matching of average target acceleration in the ipsilateral remembered condition. Overall, these results demonstrate that dynamic proprioceptive feedback-matching performance is influenced by several factors including peak speed, task difficulty and limb preference."},{"method":"In the present study, we report the effects of high sustained hypergravity after 7 days' simulated weightlessness on learning and memory abilities and neuronal apoptosis in rats.","background":"It has been demonstrated that altered gravity may lead to impairments in cognitive functions. However, the effect of a combination of hypergravity and weightlessness on cognitive functions is not well understood.","conclusion":"In the Y-maze tests, hypergravity (HG) or simulated weightlessness (SW) significantly decreases accuracy, and increases reaction time of rats compared to that of controls. On the contrary, in the passive avoidance test, HG or SW treatment significantly shortens latency and prolongs total time compared to those of controls. In addition, TUNEL staining shows a few apoptotic cells in cortex and hippocampus in the HG, SW and HG+SW groups, and the number of TUNEL positive cells was found to be the most in the HG+SW group. Furthermore, rats with combined HG and SW treatment reveal a synergistic effect in both the Y-maze and the passive avoidance tests, as well as increased neuronal cell death. These findings suggest that simulated weightlessness may exacerbate hypergravity-induced impairment of learning and memory, likely caused by neuronal cell death in rats."},{"method":"The present experiments measured depressive-like, anxiety-like and motor behavior in Sig-1R knockout mice and their wildtype littermates.","background":"Activation of sigma-1 receptors (Sig-1R) reportedly has antidepressant-like action. Limited data suggest that Sig-1Rs also modulate anxiety-related behaviors.","conclusion":"Sig-1R knockout mutants showed increased immobility in the forced swimming test, a depressive-like phenotype, but normal anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze and light\/dark box tests and normal locomotor activity. The results further suggest that Sig-1Rs inversely modulate depressive-like behavior."},{"method":"Motor skills (including total distance walked\/traveled and total horizontal and vertical activities) were evaluated in a box-field system at 1 and 7 days post-lesion. In order to investigate whether these alterations were associated with the oxidative\/nitrergic stress evoked by the nitrogen reactive species peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) in the striatum, some rats were pretreated with the ONOO(-) decomposition catalyst iron porphyrinate (Fe(TPPS), 10 mg\/kg, i.p.) 120 min prior to toxins infusion. With the aim to further characterize some possible mechanisms by which motor tasks were affected and\/or preserved, biochemical analysis of peroxidative damage to lipids and mitochondrial dysfunction were both assessed in synaptic membranes isolated from the striata of QUIN-, 3-NP- and\/or Fe(TPPS)-treated animals.","background":"In this study, we reproduced two toxic models resembling some motor\/kinetic deficits of Huntington's disease induced by bilateral intrastriatal injections of either quinolinic acid (QUIN, 120 nmol\/microl per side) or 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP, 250 nmol\/microl per side) to rats.","conclusion":"Our results show that targeting oxidative\/nitrergic stress by Fe(TPPS) in these toxic models results in amelioration of motor deficits linked to inhibition of peroxidative damage and recovery of mitochondrial function in synaptic membranes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the protection exerted by Fe(TPPS) on the biochemical markers analyzed reflects the possible preservation of the functional status of the nerve tissue by limiting the deleterious actions of ONOO(-), further accounting for partial recovery of integrative motor functions."},{"method":"This was the objective of the present study and to that end, the effects of nicotine administration prior to and following motor cortex stroke were examined in a skilled reaching task. The task provides a thorough assessment of learned nonuse and constraint-induced recovery of behavior as determined by both end-point and movement element analysis. Nicotine (0.3 mg\/kg p.o.) was administered twice daily during reach training and following motor cortex stroke. Rats were divided into four groups based on their pre-\/post-stroke treatment: nicotine\/nicotine, nicotine\/vehicle, vehicle\/nicotine, vehicle\/vehicle.","background":"Nicotine, a cholinergic agonist, rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier, promotes neuronal plasticity and has been suggested to enhance behavior in a variety of neurological conditions. Nicotine has also been suggested to benefit functional recovery in rodent models of stroke. At present there has been no systematic investigation of the potential benefits of nicotine therapy in both the acute and chronic post-stroke period.","conclusion":"After stroke, nicotine did not counteract learned nonuse, facilitate constraint-induced therapy, or improve long-term recovery as measured by end-point analysis and movement element analysis. The results are discussed in relation to the problem of identifying pharmacotherapeutic agents that augment rehabilitation following stroke."},{"method":"Thirty healthy volunteers were included in the study. The lateralization index (LI) was measured with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography for each subject during four language tasks: a cued word generation task (WF), a sentence construction task (SENT), a reading task (READ), and a semantic decision task (SEMANT).","background":"Language dominance has repeatedly been demonstrated by means of functional transcranial Doppler (fTCD) ultrasonography. However, one strongly lateralizing paradigm might be an overestimation of overall language lateralization. We hypothesized that significant differences between hemodynamic patterns could be shown by using multiple language functions (such as productive and receptive tasks). Particularly, we expected more left-hemispheric activity in frontal and productive tasks and we expected less clear left-hemispheric activity in temporal regions and receptive tasks.","conclusion":"Left-hemispheric dominance was found in 90%, 80%, 73.3% and 66.7% of the subjects for respectively WF, SENT, READ and SEMANT. A repeated measures analysis of variance revealed significant differences in LIs between the different language tasks (p&lt;.01). Our results showed that productive and syntactic tasks (WF and SENT) lateralize stronger than receptive tasks (READ and SEMANT). The use of a variety of language tasks in the determination of language lateralization therefore appears to be essential in providing a more comprehensive view of language functioning."},{"method":"We examined slow (e.g., theta) and fast (e.g., gamma) brain rhythms related to rule violation. A time-frequency decomposition analysis on a wide range of frequencies band (0-95 Hz) indicated that the theta activity relates to evaluation processes, regardless of motor\/action processes.","background":"Theta rhythm has been connected to ERP components such as the error-related negativity (ERN) and the feedback-related negativity (FRN). The nature of this theta activity is still unclear, that is, whether it is related to error detection, conflict between responses or reinforcement learning processes.","conclusion":"Similarities between the theta activities found in rule-violation tasks and in tasks eliciting ERN\/FRN suggest that this theta activity reflects the operation of general evaluation mechanisms. Moreover, significant effects were found also in fast brain rhythms. These effects might be related to the synchronization between different types of cognitive processes involving the fulfillment of a task (e.g., working memory, visual perception, mathematical calculation, etc.)."},{"method":"Therefore, this study examined the thresholds of DPAG-evoked panic-like behaviors in rats showing RC behaviors. Rats bearing electrodes in the DPAG and right AMY were subjected to either the full- (Kin-F) or sham- (Kin-S) kindling of AMY. RC behaviors were evaluated throughout both kindling procedures. Thresholds of DPAG-evoked defensive behaviors were recorded before and after the kindling. Moreover, performances of Kin-F and Kin-S rats in the elevated plus-maze were compared to those of intact controls.","background":"Panic attacks present a high comorbidity with agoraphobia, separation anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder. Nevertheless, while panic attacks have been frequently equated to fear, the relationship of panic disorder with specific phobias remains uncertain. The combination of experimental models of panic and phobias could but afford valuable information about both the comorbidity and causation of these disorders. As it regards, while the defensive behaviors produced by stimulation of dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (DPAG) resemble a panic attack, resistance to capture (RC) behaviors that ensue the kindling of the amygdala (AMY) are reminiscent of a phobic reaction.","conclusion":"Data showed that Kin-F and Kin-S rats perform similarly in the elevated plus-maze, thereby making AMY-kindled rats unlikely as a model of generalized anxiety disorder. On the other hand, whereas the RC is characterized by a marked facilitation of natural freezing and flight behaviors, DPAG-evoked freezing (immobility and exophthalmus) and flight (galloping) behaviors were unexpectedly attenuated. Data suggest that RC is mediated by circuits distinct from those of DPAG-evoked defensive behaviors. Consequently, panic and phobic attacks may be mediated by different mechanisms as well."},{"method":"The present study examined the influence of candesartan on memory impairment induced by intracerebral streptozotocin (IC STZ 0.5 mg\/kg) in mice.

Further, treatment with 0.1 mg\/kg candesartan for 14 days significantly improved spatial memory in mice in water maze test also. In another group, after memory impairment in mice following IC STZ administration, memory improving effect of a 7 days treatment with 0.1 mg\/kg candesartan lasted only for 3 subsequent days in water maze task. IC STZ increased oxidative stress but pretreatment with 0.1 mg\/kg candesartan decreased oxidative stress as indicated by a decrease in MDA and increase in GSH. Further, candesartan decreased free radicals as evidenced by flow cytometry. IC STZ affected cholinergic system also by increasing acetylcholine esterase activity that was restored by pretreatment with 0.1 mg\/kg candesartan. Locomotor activity and serum glucose level remained unaffected by candesartan treatment. These results suggest that AT1 receptors play a facilitatory role in STZ induced memory deficit and corroborate number of human studies that AT1 receptor blockers can be used therapeutically against cognitive decline in hypertensive patients."},{"method":"In this work, four-month-old Wistar (regular 4-day cyclic) virgin female rats were utilized in the proestrus-to-estrus phase of the reproductive cycle for experimental exposure. In an isolated room, female rats were exposed for 90 min to male-soiled bedding (MSB). Elevated plus-maze assay, open field test, and light\/dark box task were performed to analyze behavioral alterations on females after exposure. For biochemical assays, female rats were killed and the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and frontal cortex were isolated for further analysis. Antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase), non-enzymatic antioxidant defense measurements (TRAP and TAR), and the oxidative damage parameters (TBARS, Carbonyl and SH content) were analyzed.","background":"Chemical cues are widely used for intraspecific social communication in a vast majority of living organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals. As an example, mammals release olfactory cues with urine that promote neuroendocrine modulations with changes in behavior and physiology in the receiver.","conclusion":"In behavioral analyses we observe that female rats show decreased anxiety and locomotory\/exploratory activities after MSB exposure. In biochemical assays we observed an increase in both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses in different central nervous system (CNS) structures analyzed 30 and 90 min after MSB exposure. Furthermore, hippocampus and frontal cortex showed diminished free radical oxidative damage at 180 and 240 min after exposure. These results provide the first evidence that oxidative profile of female CNS structures are altered by chemical cues present in the MSB, thus suggesting that pheromonal communication is able to modulate radical oxygen species production and\/or clearance in the female brain."},{"method":"The current study assessed whether treatment with AAS throughout adolescence influenced the immunohistochemical localization of 5-HT(2A) in areas of the hamster brain implicated in the control of aggression.

Serotonin (5-HT) modulates aggressive behavior and has been shown to be altered after chronic treatment with AAS. Furthermore, 5-HT type 2 receptors have been implicated in the control of aggression. For example, treatment with 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists suppress the generation of the offensive aggressive phenotype. However, it is unclear whether these receptors are sensitive to adolescent AAS exposure.","conclusion":"When compared with non-aggressive oil-treated controls, aggressive AAS-treated hamsters showed significant increases in 5-HT(2A)-ir fibers in the lateral portion of the anterior hypothalamus (LAH). Further analysis revealed that AAS treatment also produced a significant increase in the number of cells expressing 5-HT(2A)-ir in the LAH.

In both human and animal studies, PPI is commonly demonstrated by an attenuation of the acoustic startle reflex when the startle-inducing pulse stimulus is shortly preceded by a weak non-startling prepulse stimulus. This weakening of the startle reaction is attributed to, and therefore also provides an indirect measure of, the inhibition triggered by the perception of the prepulse stimulus. The relative ease in measuring the overt pulse-elicited startle reaction, in comparison with the relatively weak prepulse-elicited reaction (PPER) has led to a near complete neglect of the latter in recent literature.","conclusion":"The theoretical implications and potential interpretative values of PPER are discussed.

The phosphorylation of the cyclic AMP-responsive-element-binding protein (CREB) was decreased following the ERK pathway inhibition either in dHP or mPFC. These findings demonstrate that the ERK pathway in either the dHP or mPFC participates in the pathophysiology of the depressive-like behavior, and may have pivotal role in human depression."},{"method":"An auditory choice test was conducted followed by exposure to tutored or untutored song or silence to examine induction of the immediate early gene, ZENK.","background":"Female zebra finches display a preference for songs of males raised with tutors compared to those from males without tutors.

However, the functional restoration of more specific gait-related patterns such as skilled walking, balance, and individual limb movements have been insufficiently studied. The purpose of this study was to investigate the behavioural effects of intrastriatal DA grafts on different aspects of normal and skilled walking in rats following unilateral 6-OHDA lesions of the medial forebrain bundle.","conclusion":"Interestingly, the analysis of walking patterns displayed a heterogeneous graft-induced response in skilled and non-skilled limb use. Grafted animals made fewer errors with their contralateral limbs in skilled walking than the sham-transplanted rats, and they improved their ipsi- and contralateral limb rotation. However, the parameter distance between feet showed a delayed recovery, and the stride length was not affected by the DA grafts at all. These findings indicate that ectopic intrastriatal transplantation of E14 ventral mesencephalon-derived cells promotes recovery of gait balance and stability, but does not ameliorate the shuffling gait pattern associated with 6-OHDA lesions. A full restoration of locomotor gait pattern might require a more complete and organotypic reconstruction of the mesotelencephalic DAergic pathway."},{"method":"Assessment of this social investigation paradigm indicated that (a) rats showed a robust preference for social investigation over nonsocial exploratory activity, (b) female rats showed a greater preference for social investigation than male rats, (c) no signs of habituation in these responses were observed when rats were tested once daily for 4 consecutive days, (d) the preference for social investigation was stable and robust in both the dark and light periods of the daily light cycle for 5 consecutive days, and (e) testing under bright light conditions suppressed social investigation. In addition, acute administration of opiate drugs, low dose morphine (1.0 mg\/kg) and naltrexone (1.0 mg\/kg) produced a more robust attenuation of social investigation than nonsocial exploratory activity. Amphetamine increased both forms of investigation and haloperidol had the opposite effect, but the overall preference for social investigation over exploratory activity remained largely intact after both amphetamine and haloperidol injection.","background":"The present series of studies provide validation of a new paradigm that uniquely combines the assessment of the propensity to engage in social investigation with measures of (nonsocial) exploratory activity in rats.","conclusion":"Together, these findings validate the use of this behavioral task to assess changes in social-motivation and general exploratory activity.

However, the long-term memory component of the reference memory task was not affected by PCP. Chronic FGL treatment had no effect on the reversal learning impairment but ameliorated the working memory deficits almost to the levels of the control groups.

The longer-duration DA reward response and corresponding elevated DA release in striatal target sites may selectively strengthen currently-active corticostriatal synapses, i.e., those associated with the successful reward-procuring behavior.","conclusion":"DA-mediated strengthening of corticostriatal synapses in regions of the dorsolateral striatum receiving afferents from primary sensorimotor cortex is likely to bind corticostriatal inputs representing the previously-emitted movement to striatal outputs contributing to the selection of the next movement segment in a behavioral sequence. Within the striatum, more generally, inputs from distinct regions of the frontal cortex that code independently for movement direction and reward expectation send convergent projections to striatal output cells. DA-mediated strengthening of active corticostriatal synapses promotes the future output of the striatal cell under similar input conditions. This is postulated to promote persistence of neuronal activity in the very cortical cells that drive corticostriatal input, leading to the establishment of sustained reverberatory loops that permit cortical movement-related cells to maintain activity until the appropriate time of movement initiation."},{"method":"The cause-effect relationship between extract-induced PPI disruption and augmented monoaminergic transmission was studied using different serotoninergic, adrenergic and dopaminergic antagonists. The effects of hypericin and hyperforin, as the main active constituents of the extract, on PPI response were also tested. PPI disruption was prevented after blocking the serotoninergic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A, alpha-adrenergic and dopaminergic D1 receptors.","background":"Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle response is a valuable paradigm for sensorimotor gating processes. Previous research showed that acute administration of St. John's wort extract (500 mg\/kg, p.o.) to rats caused significant disruption of PPI while elevating monoamines levels in some brain areas.","conclusion":"Results also demonstrated a significant PPI deficit after acute treatment of rats with hyperforin, and not hypericin. In some conditions manifesting disrupted PPI response, apoptosis coexists. Electrophoresis of DNA isolated from brains of hyperforin-treated animals revealed absence of any abnormal DNA fragmentation patterns. It is concluded that serotoninergic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A, alpha-adrenergic and dopaminergic D1 receptors are involved in the disruptive effect of St. John's wort extract on PPI response in rats. We can also conclude that hyperforin, and not hypericin, is one of the active ingredients responsible for St. John's wort-induced PPI disruption with no relation to apoptotic processes."},{"method":"Several animal models are being used to investigate this hypothesis.","background":"There is increasing evidence of immune involvement in both schizophrenia and autism. Of particular interest are striking abnormalities in the expression of immune-related molecules such as cytokines in the brain and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). It is proposed that this represents a permanent state of brain immune dysregulation, which begins during early development. One possibility is that maternal infection, a known risk factor for schizophrenia and autism, sets this immune activation in motion.","conclusion":"There is also recent evidence that, among schizophrenic subjects, those associated with maternal infection display a distinctive pathology, which suggests that diverse causes for this disorder may explain some of its heterogeneity. The human and animal results related to immune involvement suggest novel therapeutic avenues based on immune interventions."},{"method":"In the present studies we sought to elucidate the mechanisms by which the effects of P are manifested. Because the onset of parental behavior in females is associated with the withdrawal of P at the end of pregnancy we tested the hypothesis that withdrawal of P would similarly enhance parental behavior in males. Virgin male mice were implanted with P or vehicle for 21 days, replicating the duration of pregnancy in females. Tests were run for parental and infanticidal behavior 5 days after removal of the capsules.","background":"Many species that engage in parental behavior exhibit infanticide under certain circumstances. The neural signals regulating the transition from infant care giver to infant killer and back remain unclear. Previously we demonstrated that progesterone (P) and its receptor (PR) have inhibitory effects on parental behavior and increase infant-directed aggression in male mice.","conclusion":"P increased the proportion of nonparental males that attacked pups. However, neither the number of males exhibiting parental care nor the quality of care was affected by P treatment. Serum P and testosterone (T) levels were not different from controls at the time of behavioral testing indicating continued elevations in peripheral hormones are not required for the expression of infanticide. In conclusion, withdrawal of P does not trigger the onset of parental behavior in males. Rather, prior exposure to P induces persistent infanticidal behavior in adult male mice."},{"method":"By associating this involatile information in individual male scents, gained on initial scent contact, with the individual male's airborne volatile signature detected simultaneously through the main olfactory system, females subsequently recognise and are attracted by the individual male's airborne volatile signature alone.","background":"Scents play key roles in mediating sexual behaviour in many vertebrates, both in the recognition of opposite sex conspecifics and in assessing the suitability of different individuals as potential mates. The recognition and assessment that underlies female attraction to male scents involves an important interaction between the main and accessory (vomeronasal) olfactory systems. Female mice gain information through the vomeronasal system on nasal contact with a scent source that is essential to stimulate attraction to an individual male's scent. Three highly polymorphic multigene families contribute involatile proteins and peptides to mouse scents that are detected through specific vomeronasal receptors during contact with scent. Major urinary proteins (MUPs) provide an individual genetic identity signature that underlies individual recognition and assessment of male competitive ability, kin recognition to avoid inbreeding, and genetic heterozygosity assessment. Familiar mates are recognised in the context of pregnancy block using MHC peptides, while exocrine-gland secreting peptides (ESPs) are likely to play additional roles in sexual assessment.","conclusion":"This allows much more rapid recognition of scents from familiar animals without requiring physical contact or processing through the vomeronasal system. Nonetheless, key information that induces attraction to a male's scent is held in involatile components detected through the vomeronasal system, allowing assessment of the genetic identity and attractiveness of each individual male."},{"method":"We found that neither post-training reversible inactivation with the GABA receptor agonists muscimol and baclofen nor inhibition of protein synthesis with anisomycin (ANI) in either the core or shell regions of the NAc had an effect on approach to a reward port in response to a reward-predictive cue (conditioned stimulus, CS+). In contrast, pre-test reversible inactivation of both the core and shell decreased conditioned responding during the CS+. Unlike inactivation of the core, however, reversible inactivation of the shell also produced an increase in responding during the CS- and the inter-trial interval.","background":"The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is important for the ability of motivationally significant stimuli to guide behavior. To further delineate its role in appetitive Pavlovian conditioning, we tested the hypothesis that the NAc contributes to memory consolidation and expression for a goal-tracking version of Pavlovian conditioned approach (PCA) in rats.","conclusion":"This suggests that the NAc is not involved in the consolidation of goal-tracking PCA, but that once the memory is formed, the core is required for expression of the CS-unconditioned stimulus (US) association and the shell is required to inhibit conditioned approach behavior at times when the CS+ is not presented."},{"method":"We show here, using response to a model predator on day 7 pf, that absence of light on day 1 pf alone causes high responsiveness to shift from left to right eye and to intensify. Absence on day 2 pf or day 3 pf produces lesser shifts, whereas absence for all 3 days reduces responsiveness without any shift.","background":"Releasers of innate responses are more effective in many vertebrates when seen by the left eye. In zebrafish Brachydanio rerio, this asymmetry is linked with neuroanatomical asymmetry of the habenular complex (enlarged left lateral and right medial habenular nuclei): if habenular asymmetry is reversed, reader response to releasers shifts to the right eye. Light exposure (schedule: 14\/10h,L\/D) during the first few days of development post fertilisation (pf) controls the patterning of this asymmetry.","conclusion":"Action on day 1 pf is likely to be due to modulation of gene expression. A known disturbance of gene (nrp1a) expression causes rerouting of the outflow of the left lateral habenula to the way station of the right medial habenula, providing a possible explanation of shifts. Variation in exposure of eggs to light is likely to produce inter-individual variation in the field."},{"method":"Administration of lithium chloride (300 mg\/L in drinking water for 21 days) had no effect on the immobility of mice in the FST, whereas 600 mg\/L lithium caused a significant (P&lt;0.001) decrease in the immobility time compared with control animals. Administration of the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10mg\/kg, daily for a week, i.p.) had no significant effect on the immobility time of either control or lithium (300 mg\/L)-treated mice, whereas acute administration of non-effective dose of L-NAME (30 mg\/kg, i.p.) caused a robust decrease (P&lt;0.01) in the immobility time of lithium (300 mg\/L)-treated animals in the FST. Moreover, chronic administration of low dose of the NO precursor L-arginine (200 mg\/kg, daily for a week, i.p.) prevented (P&lt;0.001) the antidepressant-like effects of lithium treatment (600 mg\/L) in the FST. Acute treatment with L-arginine (200 mg\/kg, i.p.) increased (P&lt;0.05) the immobility time of lithium (600 mg\/L)-treated mice in the FST.","background":"In the present study we evaluated the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) system in the antidepressant-like effects of chronic lithium administration in the mouse forced swimming test (FST).","conclusion":"Chronic lithium treatment (600 mg\/L but not 300 mg\/L) caused a significant (P&lt;0.05) decrease in the serum NO(X) levels in mice compared with controls. Our data suggested that the NO system could be involved in the antidepressant-like effect of chronic lithium treatment in the FST."},{"method":"We have developed a network model of the striatal direct pathway using an ionic current level model of the medium spiny neuron that incorporates currents sensitive to changes in the tonic level of dopamine. The model neurons in the network learn action selection based on a novel set of mathematical rules that incorporate the phasic change in the dopamine signal. This network model is capable of learning to perform a sequence learning task that in humans is thought to be dependent on the basal ganglia.","background":"The striatal dopamine signal has multiple facets; tonic level, phasic rise and fall, and variation of the phasic rise\/fall depending on the expectation of reward\/punishment.","conclusion":"When both tonic and phasic levels of dopamine are decreased, as would be expected in unmedicated Parkinson's disease (PD), the model reproduces the deficits seen in a human PD group off medication. When the tonic level is increased to normal, but with reduced phasic increases and decreases in response to reward and punishment, respectively, as would be expected in PD medicated with L-Dopa, the model again reproduces the human data. These findings support the view that the cognitive dysfunctions seen in Parkinson's disease are not solely either due to the decreased tonic level of dopamine or to the decreased responsiveness of the phasic dopamine signal to reward and punishment, but to a combination of the two factors that varies dependent on disease stage and medication status."},{"method":"Male C57BL\/6 mice were divided into four groups as follows: (1) control mice (C mice) fed in a normal cage without immobilization; (2) restraint-stressed (RS mice) fed in a small cage; (3) vitamin E mice (VE mice), mice were fed in a small cage with a diet supplemented with vitamin E; (4) GliSODin mice (GS mice) fed in a small cage with a diet supplemented with GliSODin. RS, VE and GS mice were exposed to 12 h of immobilization daily. Five weeks later, spatial learning was measured using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test. After water maze testing, we performed immunohistochemical analysis using 4-hydroxy-2-noneral (4-HNE) and an anti-Ki67 antibody. 4-HNE is a marker of lipid peroxidation.","background":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of antioxidant ingestion on stress-induced impairment of cognitive memory.","conclusion":"RS mice showed impaired spatial learning performance and an increased number of 4-HNE-positive cells in the granule cell layer (GCL) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus when compared to C mice. Moreover, RS mice showed a decreased number of Ki67-positive cells in the subgranular zone (SGZ). GS mice showed better spatial learning memory than RS mice. The number of 4-HNE-positive cells in the GCL of GS mice was significantly less than that of RS mice. The number of Ki67-positive cells in the SGZ of GS mice was significantly greater than that of RS mice. These finding suggests that GliSODin prevents stress-induced impairment of cognitive function and maintains neurogenesis in the hippocampus through antioxidant activity."},{"method":"Here, for the first time, we tested anxiety in a diurnal rodent, Octodon degus, according to its age (23 versus 40 months of age) and the time of the day. We employed three anxiety tests: object recognition, open field and light-dark tests, which were applied in the morning, at mid-day and in the late afternoon, respectively.","background":"Animal models of anxiety have usually employed nocturnal species (e.g. rats and mice), and the tests used have been almost exclusively performed during the diurnal phase (lights on).","conclusion":"Adult animals spent more time exploring a new object than aged animals. Nevertheless, there were no differences in the frequency of object exploration or in the latency to the first object approach between the groups. In the open field test, adult animals spent more time exploring (ambulation and rearing) than aged ones. Although both groups exhibited similar frequencies in transition from the dark to the light box in the light-dark test, adult animals spent significantly more time in the light, and expressed less anxiety when making the decision to cross over from the dark into the light area. In conclusion, there were no differences in anxiety between adult and aged animals in the morning session, although adult animals were more attentive when exploring a new object. However, in the mid-day and afternoon testing sessions, aged animals were more anxious than adults."},{"method":"The present study was carried out to evaluate the acute effects of PCP and NO synthase inhibition on social interaction in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The NO synthase inhibitor, L-NAME (10mg\/kg) and PCP (2mg\/kg) was injected subcutaneously to rats, which were then tested in pairs for social interactive behaviour. Twenty-four hours after the initial test a drug-free social interaction test was carried out to assess the rats' memory of the previous social interaction.","background":"Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder generally considered to encompass positive symptoms, negative symptoms and cognitive deficits. Increasing attention has been paid to the social cognitive deficits of the disorder as these dysfunctions are particularly handicapping, predictive of functional outcome and show poor treatment response. Phencyclidine (PCP) is a psychotomimetic drug used to model the different aspects of schizophrenia in experimental animal models. PCP-induced cognitive deficits and hyperlocomotion may be blocked by pretreatment with nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitors in rodents.","conclusion":"The results showed that PCP reduced the time of social interaction on Day 1 compared to controls, and that pretreatment with the NO synthase inhibitor, L-NAME, attenuated this reduction towards control levels. Neither locomotor activity, nor frequency of social interactions were affected by the PCP treatment, suggesting that the PCP-induced effects observed were not due to drug-induced stereotypies. In combination with increasing clinical evidence for the involvement of NO in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, the present results indicate that NO synthase inhibition may be a potentially new treatment strategy for alleviating social dysfunction in schizophrenia."},{"method":"To examine the influence of sexual experience on subsequent stress-induced defensive behavior and cell proliferation in the hippocampus we exposed adult male rats to TMT odor with or without prior exposure to sexually receptive female rats. A subset of rats was injected with the DNA-synthesis marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; 200 mg\/kg) during TMT exposure and perfused 24 h later to provide an index of cell proliferation within the dentate gyrus.","background":"Acute exposure to the predator odor trimethylthiazoline (TMT) induces defensive behavior in the male rat, and this response is associated with a decrease in cell proliferation within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Sexual experience appears to be protective, as it exerts anxiolytic-like effects and sustains gonadal function in the face of stress.","conclusion":"In response to TMT, sexual experience reduced the duration of stretched attend postures, but had no significant effect on defensive burying. Furthermore, TMT induced a significant increase in cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus, but only in males with sexual experience.

The effect of folic acid (10 nmol\/site, i.c.v.) was prevented by the pretreatment of mice with naloxone (1 mg\/kg, i.p., a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist), naltrindole (3 mg\/kg, i.p., a selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist), naloxonazine (10 mg\/kg, i.p., a selective mu(1)-opioid receptor antagonist, 24 h before), but not with naloxone methiodide (1 mg\/kg, s.c., a peripherally acting opioid receptor antagonist). In addition, a sub-effective dose of folic acid (1 nmol\/site, i.c.v.) produced a synergistic antidepressant-like effect in the FST with a sub-effective dose of morphine (1 mg\/kg, s.c.). A further approach was designed to investigate the possible relationship between the opioid system and NMDA receptors in the mechanism of action of folic acid in the FST. Pretreatment of the animals with naloxone (1 mg\/kg, i.p.) prevented the synergistic antidepressant-like effect of folic acid (1 nmol\/site, i.c.v.) and MK-801 (0.001 mg\/kg, i.p., a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist).","background":"The opioid system has been implicated in major depression and in the mechanism of action of antidepressants.","conclusion":"Together the results firstly indicate that the anti-immobility effect of folic acid in the FST is mediated by an interaction with the opioid system (mu(1) and delta), likely dependent on the inhibition of NMDA receptors elicited by folic acid."},{"method":"We report that systemic administration of the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 6h prior to behavioral assessment does not influence spatial acquisition or retention in male C57BL\/6J mice.","background":"Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is constitutively expressed in neurons of the hippocampus and neocortex. Therefore, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) targeting inflammation-induced COX-2 in the periphery and the central nervous system may also affect cognitive function mediated by basal COX-2 activity.","conclusion":"However, we observed impaired spatial retention in female mice treated with NS-398, suggesting a sex-dependent role of COX-2 in spatial memory of mice."},{"method":"Mice maintained at 90 +\/- 5% of ad libitum bodyweight, were tested in operant chambers provided with nose-poking holes. Nose poking in one hole resulted in the immediate delivery of one food pellet (small-soon, SS), whereas nose poking in the other hole delivered five food pellets after a delay (large-late, LL), which was increased progressively each day (0-150 s).

In home-cage circadian activity as well as in a novelty-seeking test, females were more active than males. It can be concluded from these results that female mice are more impulsive than male mice under mild food restriction. This is in contrast with findings in earlier studies with more severe food restriction. Therefore, an alternative explanation is that females are more explorative, and that different features might be tested in delay-discounting paradigms, depending on restriction levels."},{"method":"Therefore, the present study systematically investigated burrowing behaviour in five rodent species, using five different burrowing substrates. It also enquired whether rats are unique among rodents in showing little burrowing of food pellets, yet burrow gravel and other earth-like substrates vigorously.","background":"In the burrowing test, mice or rats spontaneously empty a tube filled with food pellets, gravel or other substances. The test is extremely simple to perform, the apparatus is inexpensive and readily constructed. It exploits a natural rodent behaviour, provides quantitative data under controlled laboratory conditions, and has proved extremely sensitive to prion disease in mice (Mus musculus), cytokines in rats (Rattus norvegicus), lipopolysaccharide in mice and rats, strain differences and brain lesions in mice. However, it has not been used in other, less common, laboratory species, and might, e.g. be useful in detecting scrapie infection in hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), a commonly used species in prion disease research.","conclusion":"The results showed that all the species (rats, mice, hamsters and gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus)), except one (Egyptian spiny mice, Acomys cahirinus, which does not dig burrows in the wild) burrowed earth-like substrates well. However, laboratory mice were the only species that burrowed food pellets vigorously, without prior exposure to other substrates. These results show that burrowing, with an appropriate substrate, can be used as a simple behavioural test in many rodent species.

BN and WKY rats showed different levels of PPI only at the intermediate intervals. Baseline PPI in the F1 rats resembled the WKY phenotype. The CRF-induced change in PPI in the F1 generation has some qualities of the effects in each of the progenitor strains.

Anxiety levels were normal on days 15 and 30 following ischemia. Similarly, time-dependent changes in locomotor activity were observed with ischemic rats showing increased activity level on days 1, 5, and 30 post-reperfusion. Surprisingly, locomotor activity was suppressed at day 15. Habituation deficits in the open-field were apparent only on day 1 despite the lack of CA1 neuronal degeneration at this time interval.

As \"too little and too much spoils everything\", our findings do not contradict the hypothesis of an involvement of IL-6 in memory processes.

In the Tower, the marmosets were not able to jump the largest distances one week after MPTP and showed a persistent reduction in activity during the 3-week period after the MPTP intoxication. Because not all aspects of motor behavior are similarly affected by MPTP, a complete behavioral sketch of parkinsonian marmosets should preferably include a range of motor behavior functions to create an overview of the full range of motor impairments.

We investigated the effect of ageing and duration of illness, and explored possible sex-specific effects of duration of illness, in working memory-related brain activity in schizophrenia.","conclusion":"Patients performed significantly worse than controls. Duration of illness correlated with reduced dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity in males and reduced cerebellum activity in females, regardless of performance and age.

We detected no significant effect of ageing on neural activation of the working memory network in patients though such an effect was present in healthy controls. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that a longer duration of schizophrenic illness has sex-specific associations within the working memory neural network, with expected association between illness duration and impaired PFC activation apparent in male, but not in female patients.

The purpose of this study was to determine to what extent the specific molecular changes that occur in the rat cerebral cortex after 96 h of PSD can effectively be reversed during 24h of recovery.","conclusion":"A total of 78 unique transcripts were differently expressed after PSD relative to control levels. These include genes related to metabolic processes, the circadian sleep-wake cycle, response to stimuli, regulation of cell proliferation and signaling pathways. After 24h of sleep rebound, approximately 62% of the sleep deprivation transcripts were again detected as differently expressed in the SR relative to the PSD group, although in the opposite direction. On the other hand, the expression of the remaining transcripts showed intermediate values between control and sleep-deprived animals. In summary, our results provide a unique set of transcripts that might be specific related to regulation of paradoxical sleep phase and sleep homeostasis processes, as well as to the biological basis of sleep disorders."},{"method":"Different behavioral situations were used to trigger sequences of movement covering the whole range of velocities in the mice, and the variations of kinematic parameters were analyzed in relation with velocity.","background":"The kinematics of locomotion was analyzed in two strains of great importance for the creation of mutated mice (C56BL\/6 and 129\/Sv).","conclusion":"Both stride frequency and stride length contributed to the moving speed, but stride frequency was found to be the main contributor to the speed increase. A trot-gallop transition was detected at speed about 70 cm\/s, in relation with a sharp shift in limb coordination. The results of this study were consistent with pieces of information previously published concerning the gait analyses of other strains, and provided an integrative view of the basic motor pattern of mice. On the other hand some qualitative differences were found in the movement characteristics of the two strains. The stride frequency showed a higher contribution to speed in 129\/Sv than in C57BL\/6. In addition, 129\/Sv showed a phase shift in the forelimb and hindlimb, and a different position of the foot during the stance time that revealed a different gait and body position during walking. Overall, 129\/Sv moved at a slower speed than C57BL\/6 in any behavioral situation. This difference was related to a basal lower level of motor activity. The possibility that an alteration in the dopamine circuit was responsible for the different movement pattern in 129\/Sv is discussed."},{"method":"Here we review evidence for the validity of gestational (day 17) MAM administration as a developmental disruption rodent model of schizophrenia.","background":"Animal models are critical for the study of psychiatric disorders since they allow the use of invasive methods that cannot be used for ethical reasons in humans. Currently there are three general models of schizophrenia; (i) those produced with acute pharmacological intervention (i.e. MK-801, ketamine, PCP and amphetamine), (ii) genetic models (i.e. mutant DISC-1, D(2)-R over expression) and (iii) developmental disruption models (i.e. MAM, neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion, isolation rearing, maternal infection).","conclusion":"Offspring from MAM-treated dams are reported to display deficits consistent with those observed in schizophrenia patients, including anatomical changes, behavioral deficits and altered neuronal information processing. Thus gestational MAM administration has been demonstrated to induce a pathodevelopmental process leading to neuroanatomical and behavioral phenotypes consistent with that observed in schizophrenia in humans."},{"method":"We investigated whether perceptual performance was traded for smooth pursuit performance. While tracking a red target cross, observers had to discriminate the orientation of a flashed peripheral grating. We manipulated the priority given to the two tasks.","background":"Smooth pursuit eye movements have been linked to perception by a common attentional mechanism.","conclusion":"Pursuit gain changed according to observers' effort to pursue the target, but perceptual discrimination of the peripheral flash was not affected by these changes, suggesting that smooth pursuit does not use the same resources as perception. Complete resource sharing may be confined to situations involving multiple moving objects. Next, we added a second perceptual task on the foveal pursuit target. Foveal discrimination performance was traded for peripheral discrimination performance and pursuit gain followed the perceptual priorities. Thus, smooth pursuit gain is affected by which target has been selected for enhanced perceptual processing, but that does not imply shared perceptual resources."},{"method":"In a genotype-blind investigation, 40 different behavioural patterns of wildtype and transgenic animals were recorded at early ages, before plaques can be found in the brains of the transgenic mice; and later in life, when these mice are known to exhibit AD-like plaques. Basal stress hormone levels (corticosterone) and cerebral amyloid-beta depositions were determined, and compared with individually and group-housed mice from non-enriched standard cages.","background":"The behaviour of transgenic animals modelling human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) is typically characterised in artificial apparatuses rather than labour-intensively observing their spontaneous behaviour in the home environment. Here we report on an in-depth behavioural characterisation of the day-to-day life of a murine model for AD living in a large (6.6 m(2)) semi-naturalistic indoor enclosure.","conclusion":"Semi-naturalistically housed transgenics could not be differentiated from wildtypes by their behavioural profiles nor by basal levels of corticosterone. Surprisingly, the brains of these transgenics revealed an even more pronounced plaque load than controls from standard-housing conditions. Behavioural traits are known to involve gene-environment interactions. Here we show for the first time that despite high beta-amyloid plaque load the day-to-day life of AD mice is not compromised when the genetic predisposition interacts with a generous physically and socially enriched environment."},{"method":"In a series of experiments the effect of a low, sub-pyrogenic dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on hippocampus-dependent learning and memory was tested.","background":"Immune system activation has been found to affect the function of the hippocampus. Sub-pyrogenic systemic inflammation impairs performance of species-typical behaviours that are also disrupted by hippocampal lesions in rodents.","conclusion":"LPS failed to impair hippocampus-dependent spatial reference memory and working memory. However, LPS affected learning a simple side-discrimination task in which an arm of a T-maze was rewarded (correct arm), and the other arm was never rewarded (incorrect arm). Whereas LPS actually enhanced performance when reward was available on every trial in the correct arm, LPS impaired learning when the correct arm was rewarded on 50% of trials. Hippocampal lesions did not impair either the continuous or partial reinforcement versions of the task. These results demonstrate that a low, sub-pyrogenic dose of LPS can impair cognitive function, but can, depending on the demands of the task, also facilitate learning. However, the double dissociation between the effects of LPS and hippocampal lesions demonstrate that sub-pyrogenic inflammation does not affect learning by disrupting hippocampal function."},{"method":"To extend these findings, we tested visuo-spatial learning and memory of male and female APPswe\/PS1dE9 mice at 16 months of age on the Barnes maze.","background":"The APPswe\/PS1dE9 mouse is a double transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease, which harbors mutant mouse\/human amyloid precursor protein (Swedish K594N\/M595L) and presenilin-1 genes (PS1-dE9). These mice develop beta-amyloid plaques and exhibit visuo-spatial learning and memory impairment in the Morris water maze (MWM) at 8-12 and 16-18 months of age.","conclusion":"APPswe\/PS1dE9 mice showed impaired acquisition learning using measures of latency, distance traveled, errors and hole deviation scores, and were less likely to use the spatial search strategy to locate the escape hole than wild-type mice. APPswe\/PS1dE9 mice also showed a deficit in memory in probe tests on the Barnes maze relative to wild-type mice. Learning and memory deficits, however, were not found during reversal training and reversal probe tests. Sex differences were observed, as male APPswe\/PS1dE9 mice had smaller reversal effects than male wild-type mice, but females of each genotype did not differ. Overall, these results replicate previous findings using the MWM, and indicate that APPswe\/PS1dE9 mice have impaired visuo-spatial learning and memory at 16 months of age."},{"method":"The parieto-occipital cortex has been investigated by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at 25% (Time 1), 50% (Time 2) and 75% (Time 3) of the reaction time from a go signal to hand movement.","background":"A large amount of evidence supports a role for the parietal and frontal cortex in the planning of reaching movements. Nevertheless, neither the timing of involvement of these areas nor if and how their activity can be influenced by external stimuli has been clarified.","conclusion":"No local effect was found with Time 1, since pulses were administered before subjects opened their eyes. Reduction of reaction time was observed at Time 2 when stimuli were applied over the anterior occipital lobe, parieto-occipital cortex and posterior parietal cortex. The effect on the posterior parietal cortex reverted when Time 3 was used. The present data confirm the existence, in humans, of a dorso-medial set of areas involved in on-line planning of reaching movements. Moreover, they provide novel evidence on the time course of this involvement. Finally, present data show that it is possible to interact with the flow of activity along this stream by appropriately delivering TMS pulses."},{"method":"Rats were trained to self-administer 1.0 mg\/kg cocaine under a fixed-interval based second-order schedule. Next, cocaine unit doses (0.1-3.0 mg\/kg) were each non-systematically available for a 5-day block of sessions. Tests (1h) were conducted on day 3 (vehicle) and day 5 (100 microg lidocaine) of each block. Lidocaine inactivation of the lateral dorsal striatum had no effect on dose-related responding or cocaine intake.","background":"Little is known regarding which neural systems regulate dose-related changes in responses maintained by self-administered cocaine. This empirical question is important because elucidating neural systems engaged in this process could provide clues for effectively treating cocaine addiction. It has been suggested that different cocaine doses represent reinforcers of differing magnitudes, implicating the dorsal striatum or orbitofrontal cortex as important.","conclusion":"In contrast, when doses along the ascending limb were available for self-administration, lidocaine inactivation of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex caused reductions in responding and cocaine intake, resulting in overall flattening of dose-response curves. This included reductions during the entire 1-h test sessions and during the interval immediately following the first cocaine infusion of test sessions. Lidocaine inactivation of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex did not alter responding during the first cocaine-free interval of test sessions, but increased the latency to the first infusion. Collectively, the findings suggest that when the amount of experience with different cocaine unit doses is limited to a few sessions, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex regulates the dose-related effects of self-administered cocaine, likely by processing information pertaining to the reinforcing value of each unit dose."},{"method":"In the present work we have carried out a detailed behavioral analysis of the APP(751SL) transgenic mouse model testing 6 age-points (from 2 to 19-20 months) and estimating in parallel the cerebral Abeta deposition. The immunohistochemistry study indicated a fast progression of Abeta(17-24) staining in several brain structures that reached for most of them, a maximal level at 7-8 months of age. Behavioral experiments showed that APP(751SL) mice displayed alterations in some general functions (muscular strength, motor activity) whereas other functions are preserved (anxiety, exploration). Acquisition and extinction of an appetitive operant conditioning were used to assess early learning deficits. Hippocampal but not dorso-lateral striatal lesion was shown to delay extinction.","background":"Current transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer disease constitute a relevant tool to examine the relationships between neuropathological lesions, neurodegeneration and clinical syndromes. Nevertheless, addressing the relation between Abeta deposition and cognition deterioration requires careful adjustment for age to decipher underlying mechanisms of impairments and identify potential therapeutic targets.","conclusion":"Although some learning deficits were detected at 5-6 months in the acquisition of the operant conditioning task, more robust impairments in extinction were observed in 7-8-month-old mice. Indeed, spatial memory deficit was associated to a selective hippocampal CA1 impairment of learning-induced Zif268 activation. Because this mouse model displayed gradual memory deficits it gives the opportunity to investigate the temporal progression of molecular and cellular mechanisms that induce cognitive decline."},{"method":"To clarify this issue, we compared the following behaviors in rats subjected to withdrawal from sub-chronic administration (2 x 7 days) of either PCP (5 mg\/kg, i.p.) or MK-801 (0.5 mg\/kg, i.p.): (1) working memory in a variable-delayed alternation task in a T-maze, (2) social interaction, and (3) motor activity in response to a (a) novel environment, (b) mild stressor, and (c) d-amphetamine challenge.","background":"The hypothesis of hypo-functionality of NMDA receptors in schizophrenia originates from the observation that administration of the NMDA antagonist phencyclidine (PCP) induces psychotic states that closely resemble schizophrenic symptoms and that persist after drug discontinuation. A large number of animal studies have used PCP and the NMDA antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801) almost interchangeably to model schizophrenia. However, PCP interacts with pharmacological targets other than NMDA receptors that are not affected by MK-801. In addition, although acute administration of either compound produces similar effects in animals, there is little information whether withdrawal from chronic MK-801 causes behavioral deficits that mimic schizophrenia symptoms as in the case of PCP.","conclusion":"Withdrawal from sub-chronic PCP caused a delay-dependent impairment of working memory, reduced social interaction and enhanced d-amphetamine-induced motor activity. These results were not replicated in animals sub-chronically treated with MK-801, which displayed only a slight decrease in social interaction. These data suggest that pharmacological antagonism at NMDA receptors is not sufficient to explain the full spectrum of PCP psychotomimetic properties."},{"method":"Ten male and 10 female healthy right-handed young adults were shown positive and negative affective social human faces and video vignettes to elicit gender differences in social\/emotional perception. Conservative ROI (region of interest) analysis indicated greater male than female activation to positive affective photos in the anterior cingulate, medial frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus, all in the right hemisphere.","background":"Few neuroimaging studies have reported gender differences in response to human emotions, and those that have examined such differences have utilized face photographs. This study presented not only human face photographs of positive and negative emotions, but also video vignettes of positive and negative social human interactions in an attempt to provide a more ecologically appropriate stimuli paradigm.","conclusion":"No significant ROI gender differences were observed to negative affective photos. Male greater than female activation was seen in ROIs of the left posterior cingulate and the right inferior temporal gyrus to positive social videos. Male greater than female activation occurred in only the left middle temporal ROI for negative social videos. Consistent with previous findings, males were more lateralized than females. Although more activation was observed overall to video compared to photo conditions, males and females appear to process social video stimuli more similarly to one another than they do for photos. This study is a step forward in understanding the social brain with more ecologically valid stimuli that more closely approximates the demands of real-time social and affective processing."},{"method":"In the open field, light-dark exploration, and zero maze tests, NC900 mice displayed anxiety-like responses. These animals were less responsive to the anxiolytic actions of diazepam in the zero maze than NC100 animals; diazepam also reduced the reactivity and attack behaviors of NC900 mice.","background":"Using selective bi-directional breeding procedures, two different lines of mice were developed. The NC900 line is highly reactive and attacks their social partners without provocation, whereas aggression in NC100 animals is uncommon in social environments. The enhanced reactivity of NC900 mice suggests that emotionality may have been selected with aggression. As certain forms of anxiety promote exaggerated defensive responses, we tested NC900 mice for the presence of an anxiety-like phenotype.","conclusion":"The NC900 mice had reduced diazepam-sensitive GABA(A) receptor binding in brain regions associated with aggression and anxiety. Importantly, there was a selective reduction in levels of the GABA(A) receptor alpha(2) subunit protein in NC900 frontal cortex and amygdala; no changes in alpha(1) or gamma(2) subunit proteins were observed. These findings suggest that reductions in the alpha(2) subunit protein in selected brain regions may underlie the anxiety and aggressive phenotype of NC900 mice. Since anxiety and aggression are comorbid in certain psychiatric conditions, such as borderline personality and posttraumatic stress disorder, investigations with NC900 mice may provide new insights into basic mechanisms that underlie these and related psychiatric conditions."},{"method":"The present experiment was designed to evaluate the effects of disrupting CA1 subcortical outputs for the temporal processing of visual objects and for a visual object novelty detection paradigm.","background":"It has been shown that CA1 subserves temporal ordering processes in the hippocampus. It has also recently been shown that transecting the subcortical outputs of dorsal CA1 via the dorsal fornix results in retrieval deficits similar to those seen after lesions to CA1.","conclusion":"The results of the present study suggest that CA1 subcortical efferents are not critically involved in temporal processing of visual objects, but are critically involved in visual object novelty detection. The data also suggest that temporal processing and novelty detection may potentially be subserved by independent mechanisms in CA1."},{"method":"In the current study, we examined both c-Fos induction and behavioral responses in the elevated plus maze and open field tests after a single intracerebroventricular dose of TCAP-1 followed by an intracerebroventricular injection of CRF in male Wistar rats.","background":"The teneurin C-terminal associated peptides (TCAPs) are a novel family of four endogenous peptides that have previously shown bioactive properties both in vitro and in vivo. Previously we have shown that repeated intracerebral injections of synthetic TCAP-1 modulate anxiety-like behaviors in three tests of anxiety, although the neural substrates responsible for these effects were previously unknown.","conclusion":"The results indicate that TCAP-1 injection attenuated the CRF-induced increase in c-Fos expression in the limbic system and many of the areas associated with the behavioral responses to stress, including the hippocampus, central and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, and dorsal raphe nucleus. Other areas, such as the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial nucleus of the amygdala, and locus coeruleus, displayed CRF-induced c-Fos levels that were unaffected by TCAP-1. Furthermore, TCAP-1 administration increased stretched-attend postures, a type of risk-assessment behavior, on the elevated plus maze. These results indicate that TCAP-1 may play a potential role in the regulation of stress by blocking CRF-mediated activity in specific stress-sensitive areas of the brain."},{"method":"Here we investigate the relationship between individual variation of asymmetry in the habenula of a South American cichlid fish, Geophagus brasiliensis, and behaviour in a commonly used test for visual laterality in fish, the detour task.","background":"Cerebral lateralization, the partitioning of cognitive tasks to one cerebral hemisphere, is a widespread phenomenon among vertebrates. Despite this diversity, every species studied to date shows substantial individual variation in the strength of lateralization. The neural basis of this trait is unclear, although asymmetries in cerebral structures have been investigated for over a century. The habenular nuclei, for example, have been shown to present striking neuroanatomical and\/or neurochemical asymmetries in species ranging from jawless fish to mammals. In teleost fish, these nuclei are relatively symmetrical in most species. Those teleosts that do have asymmetrical habenular nuclei, show varying patterns of asymmetry in different species.","conclusion":"We show that the strength of asymmetry in the habenula is correlated with strength of behavioural lateralization in the detour task. Both the strength and direction of habenular asymmetry are correlated with individual differences in growth rate. We suggest that this relationship results from processes linking growth rate and sexual differentiation to frequency-dependent variation in life-history strategies. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a relationship at the individual level between neural asymmetry and lateralized behaviour in a fish."},{"method":"The subjects were divided in two groups; the first group was exposed to 70 sessions under a DRL 10s schedule. SHR rats showed an apparent temporary deficit in the inhibition of responses process; however, no differences among strains were observed in terms of the timing process. The second group of rats was exposed to 30 sessions in DRL 10s schedule, before receiving three doses (2 mg\/kg, 4 mg\/kg and 8 mg\/kg) of methylphenidate.","background":"In this experiment, we used a differential reinforcement of low rates (DRL) schedule to evaluate the performance of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and Wistar (WIS) rats, with the goal of dissociating the processes of timing and inhibition of responses through the use of two quantitative models: the peak deviation analysis and the temporal regulation model.","conclusion":"The results obtained through both models were consistent and indicated that at higher drug doses, the performance of all three strains of rats deteriorated. The impulsivity exhibited by SHR during acquisition supports the idea of these rats as an adequate animal model of ADHD. In contrast, evidence against this relies on the normal temporal processing found and in the worsening effect that methylphenidate produced in the process of inhibition of responses. These mixed results suggest the necessity of exploring timing behavior of other animal models in order to find a reliable animal model of ADHD."},{"method":"We investigated the hypnotic effects of the commonly prescribed non-benzodiazepine sleep agent Zolpidem (Ambien) on sleep architecture and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in the neonatal ferret.

They were then administered in a counter-balanced design vehicle, or Zolpidem (2 mg\/kg or 20 mg\/kg) via intraperitoneal injection (1x\/day over three days at 1 p.m.).","background":"Hypnotic drugs designed to treat insomnia in adults are now increasingly used in children, but the effects of these compounds on neonatal sleep are poorly understood.","conclusion":"Zolpidem did not increase non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) or total sleep time. Instead Zolpidem reduced REM sleep and total sleep amounts and increased NREM sleep bout duration. Zolpidem also increased higher-frequency EEG energies during REM and NREM sleep and transiently produced a behavioral state that appeared intermediate between wake and sleep. Our findings demonstrate that hypnotics that improve sleep quality in adults may produce profoundly different behavioral changes in neonates."},{"method":"In this study, we assessed different factors associated with this susceptibility, including strain, sex, and open-field behavior. Testing of three rat strains (Holtzman, Long-Evans, and Sprague-Dawley) revealed that Holtzman rats were the most susceptible to helplessness. Holtzman rats not only had the longest escape latencies following inescapable shock, but also showed spontaneous escape deficits in the absence of prior shock when tested with a fixed-ratio 2 (FR2) running response. Moreover, when tested with fixed-ratio 1 (FR1) running - an easy response normally unaffected by helplessness training in rats - inescapable shock significantly increased the escape latencies of Holtzman rats. Within the Holtzman strain, we confirmed recent findings that females showed superior escape performance and therefore appeared more resistant to helplessness than males. However, regression and covariance analyses suggest that this sex difference may be explained by more baseline ambulatory activity among females.","background":"Learned helplessness represents a failure to escape after exposure to inescapable stress and may model human psychiatric disorders related to stress. Previous work has demonstrated individual differences in susceptibility to learned helplessness.","conclusion":"In addition, some indices of novelty reactivity (greater exploration of novel vs. familiar open-field) predicted subsequent helpless behavior. In conclusion, Holtzman rats, and especially male Holtzman rats, have a strong predisposition to become immobile when stressed which interferes with their ability to learn active escape responses. The Holtzman strain therefore appears to be a commercially available model for studying susceptibility to helplessness in males, and novelty-seeking may be a marker of this susceptibility."},{"method":"In the present study, spatial exploration was assessed in rats using a plus maze spontaneous alternation task. ACh efflux was assessed simultaneously in the hippocampus and two sub-regions of the RSC (areas 29ab and 30) before, during and after maze exploration.","background":"Both the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and the hippocampus are important for spatial learning across species. Although hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) release has been associated with learning on a number of spatial tasks, relatively little is understood about the functional role of ACh release in the RSC.","conclusion":"Results demonstrated that there was a significant rise in ACh efflux in RSC area 29ab and the hippocampus during maze traversal. The rise in ACh efflux across these two regions was correlated. There were no significant behaviorally driven changes in ACh efflux in RSC area 30. While both the hippocampal sectors and area 29ab displayed increases in ACh efflux during maze exploration, the percent ACh rise in area 29ab was higher than that observed in the hippocampus and persisted into the post-baseline period. Joint efflux analyses demonstrated a key functional role for ACh release in area 29ab during spatial processing."},{"method":"In the present study, we set out to determine the effects of social modeling and observational learning on fear conditioning in the mouse. Observers were pre-exposed to a novel context in the presence of fearful (F group) or non-fearful (NF group) demonstrators.","background":"Social interactions with conspecifics markedly alter the neuroendocrine, behavioral and emotional responses to stressful events. Some of these effects involve observational learning and result in lasting changes of fear-motivated behavior. While most evidence reveals increased fearfulness after observation of fearful demonstrators (models) in a number of species, a few reports from human and non-human primates indicate that observational learning can also attenuate some forms of fear.","conclusion":"Mice of the F group acquired control levels of conditioned fear. On the other hand, mice of the NF group exhibited profound and persistent reduction of fear. The decrease of fear in NF observers was most likely due to context-specific impairments of fear conditioning, as revealed by selective effects on long- but not short-term contextual fear memory, and normal fear conditioning in response to a novel context or cue. The effect was lasting, but constrained by the shock intensity. Attenuation of fear conditioning resulting from interactions with non-fearful conspecifics was largely, but not entirely, mediated by vicarious learning. These findings identify an important social buffering process serving to prevent a lasting induction of fear in response to isolated, moderately intense stressful events."},{"method":"Experimental conditions differed in the size of the arena (small, medium, or large) and whether the food-baited corner was near or far from a visual feature.

However, in this condition, there was a significant trend suggesting an increasing and decreasing use of, respectively, featural and geometric information with increasing arena size. Continued training with the feature removed caused all rats to primarily visit Corners C and R, reflecting the exclusive use of geometric information. However, again, there was a significant trend suggesting a decreasing use of this type of information with increasing arena size.

No neuronal cell loss was observed in the hippocampus at 6 weeks post-SE. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analyses revealed that down-regulation of NMDA receptor subunit 2B (NR2B) and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) expression in adult hippocampus was found at 4 weeks post-SE and a further decrease at 6 weeks post-SE compared with rats without SRS after NS or KA-VPA treatment.","background":"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizure (SRS), is associated with behavioural problems, but the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been clearly identified.","conclusion":"Furthermore, the decreased expression of NR2B and PSD-95 was correlated with the representatively behavioural deficit. These findings suggest that long-term SRS might decrease NR2B\/PSD-95 expression in adult hippocampus and consequently cause behavioural deficits, including spatial learning memory deficit, anxiety and increased locomotor activity. Maintaining the expression of NR2B\/PSD-95 might partially contribute to the normal behaviour in rats with long-term SRS."},{"method":"In this study, we evaluated medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) involvement in both anxiety-like behaviour and increased anxiety-like responses induced by uncontrollable restraint.

In addition, decreased anxiety-like behaviour in both passive avoidance and escape behaviours were observed in restrained rats with mPFC lesions.

Deterioration of memory begins in advance of old age in animals, including humans. Thus, it is extremely important to prevent memory decline for increasing healthy aging. Ginsenoside, the effective ingredient of ginseng, has been reported to have a neuron beneficial effect, but the preventive role on memory impairment and the underlying mechanisms have not been well determined.","conclusion":"The efficacious effect of ginsenoside was manifested in the amelioration of memory impairment in aged mice by Morris water maze and step-down tests. Compared with aged control group, the plasticity-related proteins including phospho-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor1 (NMDAR1), phospho-calcium-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMK II), phospho-PKA catalytic beta subunit (PKA Cbeta), phospho-cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in hippocampus significantly increased in ginsenoside treated group. These findings suggest that ginsenoside is effective on the prevention of age-related memory impairment, and the up-regulation of plasticity-related proteins in hippocampus may be one of the mechanisms."},{"method":"In the current paper we show that an animated (moving) image of this predator elicits significant behavioral responses and that these responses can be quantified using video-tracking.","background":"Zebrafish is gaining popularity in basic behavioral brain research, behavior genetics, and in translational studies because it offers a cheap and efficient alternative to rodents. Abnormally exaggerated fear and anxiety are some of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric diseases in the human society whose mechanisms are not well understood. These diseases still represent major unmet medical needs. Ethologically relevant fear paradigms involving the presentation of predators, or of stimuli characteristic of predators, have been proposed as appropriate for the modeling and the analysis of fear responses. Previously, we have shown that zebrafish respond specifically to visual stimuli of their sympatric predator, the Indian leaf fish.","conclusion":"As stimulus presentation and behavioral response quantification are both computerized and automated, we suggest the paradigm is appropriate for high throughput screening and, once pharmacologically and behaviorally validated, may have utility in the detection of anxiolytic or anxiogenic properties of compounds or in the identification of fear altering mutations."},{"method":"Male Sprague-Dawley rats were screened for their response to inescapable novelty and classified as HR or LR rats.

Therefore, the current study examined the role of the ACe in the expression of both amphetamine-induced sensitization and conditioned hyperactivity in HR and LR rats.","conclusion":"HR rats displayed conditioned hyperactivity, while LR rats did not, suggesting that HR and LR rats differ in the expression of conditioned hyperactivity. While ACe inactivation attenuated the expression of conditioned hyperactivity, it did not differentially affect HR and LR rats. Following additional training and a 10-day rest period, all rats were then tested for amphetamine-induced sensitization (1.0 mg\/kg) following an infusion of muscimol or PBS. Inactivation of the ACe attenuated the expression of sensitization only in HR rats.

For example, blockade of muscarinic and beta-adrenergic receptors has been shown to impair short-term memory of both socially relevant as well as of neutral odors. However, previous studies have not explicitly compared the role of cholinergic and adrenergic modulation in long-term memory for socially relevant odor vs. incidental odor stimuli.","conclusion":"The results demonstrated that scopolamine disrupts memory acquisition and\/or consolidation of mint odor, and did not have any effect during retrieval of mint odor memory. Conversely, scopolamine disrupts memory consolidation and retrieval of estrous odor, depending on the dose applied. Propranolol injections have no effect on acquisition or consolidation for mint or estrous odor, but disrupt memory retrieval of familiar odor regarding their social\/sexual or neutral content. These results demonstrate that muscarinic receptors are required differentially during long-term odor memory formation and for familiar odor recognition depending on the socially relevant content of the stimulus. Furthermore, the beta-adrenergic system could play an important role in memory recognition for familiar odors, regardless of the sexual\/social or neutral content of the stimuli."},{"method":"Immediately after the experimental transient hypotension period ended, human processed lipoaspirate-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC, 1 x 10(6)) were administered via the femoral vein. Rats were tested in relation to their cognitive spatial abilities using the Morris water maze before and 3 days after transient oligemia and with\/without hMSC transplantation. Immunohistological investigations were performed with respect to apoptosis and BrdU staining.","background":"The aim of the present study was to examine whether a single infusion of human adult mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) has protective effects on rat cognitive functions after systemic hemorrhagic shock. Systemic hemorrhagic rat shock model of pronounced (30 min) systemic hypotension [30-40 mmHg mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) reduction] was used to induce cerebral oligemia.","conclusion":"A clear functional improvement was observed in the rats' spatial cognitive abilities after hypotension and subsequent hMSC transplantation. In the hypotension group, hMSC infusion reduced the mortality from 50% to 25%. Six days after hMSC administration and hypotension, we did not detect any BrdU-labeled cells in rat brain, lung, and liver; however, BrdU-positive cells were found in spleen. No signs of cerebral apoptosis were observed. We conclude from this study that hMSCs derived from peripheral blood could be an important cell source to improve functional outcome after transient cerebral oligemia. Identifying the underlying mechanism for this, however, should be the subject of further investigations."},{"method":"A single-trial step-down passive avoidance task was used for the assessment of memory retention in adult male NMRI mice. Pre-training intra-CA1 administration of a GABAA receptor agonist, muscimol (0.025, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 microg\/mouse) dose dependently induced impairment of memory retention. Pre-test injection of muscimol (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 microg\/mouse, intra-CA1) induced state-dependent retrieval of the memory acquired under pre-training muscimol (0.1 microg\/mouse, intra-CA1) influence. Pre-test injection of morphine (0.5 and 1 mg\/kg, s.c.) 30 min before the administration of muscimol (0.1 microg\/mouse, intra-CA1) dose dependently inhibited muscimol state-dependent memory. Pre-test intra-CA1 injection of naloxone (0.1 and 0.2 microg\/mouse, intra-CA1) improved pre-training muscimol (0.1 microg\/mouse)-induced retrieval impairment. Moreover, pre-test administration of naloxone (0.1 and 0.2 microg\/mouse, intra-CA1) with an ineffective dose of muscimol (0.025 microg\/mouse) significantly restored the retrieval and induced muscimol state-dependent memory.","background":"In the present study, the effects of subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of morphine, a mu-opioid receptor agonist and intra-dorsal hippocampal (intra-CA1) injections of naloxone, a mu-opioid receptor antagonist on muscimol state-dependent memory were examined in mice.","conclusion":"These findings implicate the involvement of a dorsal hippocampal mu-opioid receptor mechanism in muscimol state-dependent memory."},{"method":"Thus the aim of the present study was to investigate the possible role of the 5-HT(7) receptor in spatial memory using 5-HT(7) receptor-deficient mice (5-HT(7)(-\/-)). A hippocampus-associated spatial memory deficit in 5-HT(7)(-\/-) mice was demonstrated using a novel location\/novel object test. A similar reduction in novel location exploration was observed in C57BL\/6J mice treated with the selective 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist SB-269970. These findings prompted an extended analysis using the Barnes maze demonstrating that 5-HT(7)(-\/-) mice were less efficient in accommodating to changes in spatial arrangement than 5-HT(7)(+\/+) mice. 5-HT(7)(-\/-) mice had specific impairments in memory compilation required for resolving spatial tasks, which resulted in impaired allocentric spatial memory whereas egocentric spatial memory remained intact after the mice were forced to switch back from striatum-dependent egocentric to hippocampus-dependent allocentric memory. To further investigate the physiological bases underlining these behaviors we compared hippocampal neurogenesis in 5-HT(7)(+\/+) and 5-HT(7)(-\/-) mice employing BrdU immunohistochemistry.","background":"The hippocampus has been implicated in aspects of spatial memory. Its ability to generate new neurons has been suggested to play a role in memory formation. Hippocampal serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission has also been proposed as a contributor to memory processing. Studies have shown that the 5-HT(7) receptor is present in the hippocampus in relatively high abundance.","conclusion":"The rate of cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus was identical in the two genotypes. From the current data we conclude that the 5-HT(7)(-\/-) mice performed by remembering a simple sequence of actions that resulted in successfully locating a hidden target in a static environment."},{"method":"The present study tested the hypothesis that increases in KYNA concentration would impair contextual fear conditioning but spare cue-specific fear conditioning. Rats in each experiment received injections of vehicle solution or l-kynurenine (L-KYN, 100mg\/kg), the precursor for KYNA. Administration of L-KYN has been shown to produce clinically relevant increases in KYNA concentration. In Experiment 1, L-KYN-treated rats exhibited impaired contextual fear memory compared to control rats, while fear conditioning to a discrete auditory cue was unaffected. In Experiment 2, rats were trained to discriminate between two different training environments, one in which foot shock was delivered and one that was not paired with foot shock. Although both groups of rats eventually learned the discrimination, learning was slower in L-KYN-treated rats. The results of Experiment 3 demonstrated that the deficits in context discrimination could not be explained by the preferential use of an elemental learning strategy by L-KYN-treated rats.","background":"The glia-derived molecule kynurenic acid (KYNA) is an antagonist of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and the glycine(B) binding site on NMDA receptors. KYNA levels are elevated in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of persons with schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, both of which are characterized by deficits in contextual learning and memory.","conclusion":"Together, these findings indicate that elevated concentration of endogenous KYNA interferes with contextual learning and memory and support the notion that increased concentration of KYNA may contribute to cognitive dysfunction. In addition, these data provide new insight into how novel 'gliotransmitters' may modulate neuronal function and behavior."},{"method":"Rats with ventral and dorsal hippocampal lesions were tested on an unreinforced test of spatial memory that takes advantage of their natural propensity to explore novelty. Rats were presented with two copies of an identical object in a large circular open field arena. Subsequently, the rats were placed back into the open field with one of the objects displaced to an adjacent quadrant of the arena.","background":"We investigated whether the ventral and dorsal hippocampus were differentially involved in incidental spatial learning.","conclusion":"Sham-operated rats and rats with ventral hippocampal lesions spent more time in the quadrant that contained the displaced object than in the quadrant that contained the non-displaced object, and more time investigating the displaced object than the non-displaced object. Rats with dorsal hippocampal lesions were impaired on both measures. Both sham and ventral hippocampal lesioned rats subsequently learned to retrieve a food pellet in the ends of each arm of a radial maze. Rats with lesions to the dorsal hippocampus showed no significant improvement in the number of errors made across training sessions and made significantly more errors, overall, than rats with ventral hippocampal or sham lesions. The findings suggest that an intact dorsal but not ventral hippocampus is necessary for spatial learning in rats."},{"method":"Herein, we present a new method for functional mapping of the rat motor cortex using non-invasive transdural electrical stimulation. This method allows a non-invasive mapping of the surface of the neocortex providing a differentiation of representative motor areas.","background":"Motor cortex stimulation oriented by functional cortical mapping is used mainly for treating otherwise intractable neurological disorders, however, its mechanism of action remains elusive.","conclusion":"This study may facilitate further investigation about the mechanisms mediating the effects of electrical stimulation, possibly benefiting patients who do not respond to this neuromodulation therapy."},{"method":"Two experiments assessed the impact of procedural factors likely to alter the evaluability of an opportunity cost (\"price\"): the work time required for a rat to earn a train of rewarding electrical brain stimulation.","background":"Behavioral economists have proposed that human preferences are constructed during their elicitation and are thus influenced by the elicitation procedure. For example, different preferences are expressed when options are encountered one at a time or concurrently. This phenomenon has been attributed to differences in the \"evaluability\" of a particular attribute when comparison to an option with a different value of this attribute is or is not available. Research on the preferences of laboratory animals has often been carried out by means of operant-conditioning methods. Formal treatments of operant behavior relate preferences to variables such as the strength and cost of reward but do not address the evaluability of these variables.","conclusion":"The results support the notion that comparison between recently encountered prices is necessary to render the price variable highly evaluable. When price is held constant over many trials and test sessions, the evaluability of this variable appears to decline. Implications are discussed for the design of procedures for estimating subjective reward strengths and costs in operant-conditioning experiments aimed at characterizing, identifying and understanding neural circuitry underlying evaluation and choice."},{"method":"In the current study, we recorded USVs emitted by rats exposed to intermittent cold water swim (ICWS) stress and subsequently evaluated their performance in an instrumental swim escape test (SET). In the SET, rats exposed to ICWS fall into two categories, resilient or vulnerable, based on good or poor learning, respectively.","background":"Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) have been observed in a number of rodent species. They occur under a variety of conditions, including aversive and stressful experiences.","conclusion":"Four of 16 rats exposed to ICWS emitted far more USVs during the stress procedure than the remaining 12. Interestingly, in the SET these USV-emitting rats appeared resilient with escape performance comparable to controls while on average the non-emitting rats failed to learn. This result demonstrates that USVs can serve as a predictor of stress resilience. USV screening during stress may serve as a novel and non-invasive strategy to predict subsequent stress reactivity and afford insight into the neural systems involved in resilience."},{"method":"We used a force-plate actometer and specialized computer algorithms to partition the data into topographically specific behavioral categories that were sensitive to HD-like abnormalities. Seven R6\/2 male mice and 7 wild-type (WT) controls were placed in a 42 cm x 42 cm force-plate actometer for 20-min recording sessions at 6-7, 8-9, 10-11 and 12-13 weeks of age.","background":"The R6\/2 mouse is a popular model of Huntington's disease (HD) because of its rapid progression and measurable behavioral phenotype. Yet current behavioral phenotyping methods are usually univariate (e.g., latency to fall from a rotarod) and labor intensive.","conclusion":"Distance traveled, number of wall rears, and number of straight runs (traveling 175 mm or more in 1.5s) were reduced in R6\/2 relative to WT mice at all ages tested. Low mobility bouts (each defined as remaining continuously in a virtual circle of 15 mm radius for 5s) were increased in R6\/2 mice at 6-7 weeks and beyond. Independent of body weight, force off-load during wall rears was reduced in R6\/2 mice except at 6-7 weeks. Power spectra of force variation during straight runs indicated an age-related progressive loss of rhythmicity in R6\/2 compared to WT, suggesting gait dysrhythmia and dysmetria. Collectively, these data, which extend results obtained with other widely different behavioral phenotyping methods, document a multifaceted syndrome of motor abnormalities in R6\/2 mice. We suggest, moreover, that the force-plate actometer offers a high-throughput tool for screening drugs that may affect symptom expression in R6\/2 or other HD model mice."},{"method":"On each of eight test days, animals were socially isolated for 3 h and then injected intraperitoneally with 0 (saline), 0.25 or 0.5 g\/kg ethanol. Twenty-five minutes later they were placed alone in a familiar test chamber for a 5-min period, followed by a 10-min encounter with a similarly injected peer. USVs were recorded during this 10-min period, while social interactions were videotaped for later scoring. BECs were measured immediately post-test on day 8.","background":"Human adolescents drink partly to facilitate their social interactions, a social facilitatory effect of ethanol also seen in adolescent rats tested under familiar test circumstances. To explore the role of hedonic affect in ethanol-induced social facilitation, this study assessed 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in pair-housed adolescent (P29-37) and adult (P71-79) Sprague-Dawley male rats during social interactions.","conclusion":"Although the 0.25 g\/kg dose of ethanol facilitated play fighting in adolescents but not adults, ethanol had little to no effect on 50 kHz USV production under these test circumstances. USV production was higher in adults than adolescents, despite adolescents consistently engaging in more social behavior. To the extent that 50 kHz USVs index the hedonic value of social interactions, these findings support the conclusion that elevations in social behavior normally evident in adolescents may not be related to increases in hedonic sensitivity for social stimuli."},{"method":"Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to HBH equivalent to 6100 m for 7 days in a simulation chamber. The cognitive performance was assessed using Morris Water Maze (MWM) task. Cholinergic markers like acetylcholine (ACh) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were evaluated in hippocampus and cortex of rats. Neuronal damage was also studied through morphological changes.","background":"Hypobaric hypoxia (HBH) can produce neuropsychological disorders such as insomnia, dizziness, memory deficiencies, headache and nausea. It is well known that exposure to HBH cause alterations of neurotransmitters and cognitive impairment in terms of learning and memory. But the mechanisms are poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate the cholinergic system alterations associated with simulated HBH induced cognitive impairment.","conclusion":"Exposure to HBH led to impairment in relearning ability and memory retrieval and it was accompanied by decrease in ACh level and increase in AChE and led to morphological damage. Administration of AChE inhibitor (AChEI), physostigmine (PHY) and galantamine (GAL) to rats during HBH exposure resulted in amelioration of the deleterious effects induced by HBH. The AChEIs were able to improve the cholinergic activity by restoring the level of ACh by blocking the AChE activity. In addition, the AChEIs also prevented neurodegeneration by reducing the AChE level in cortical and hippocampal neurons."},{"method":"In this study, we examined the effect of long-term SI rearing after weaning on emotional behaviors and cognitive function in mice. Furthermore, the effects of methylphenidate (MPH), clozapine (CLZ) and fluoxetine (FLX) on SI-induced behavioral changes were examined to measure the predictive validity of SI-reared mice as an animal model for these neuropsychiatric disorders.","background":"Social isolation (SI) rearing in rodents causes a variety of behavioral changes, including hyperlocomotion, anxiety, impulsivity, aggression, and learning and memory deficits. These behavioral abnormalities in rodents may be related to the symptoms in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism, schizophrenia and depression.","conclusion":"MPH improved SI-induced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated-plus maze test, but had no effect on aggressive behavior. In contrast, CLZ ameliorated aggressive behavior, but not anxiety-like behavior in SI-reared mice. Repeated FLX treatment prevented SI-induced aggressive behavior and social interaction deficits. These findings suggest that SI-induced behavioral abnormality is a psychobehavioral complex relevant to various clinical symptoms observed in neuropsychiatric disorders and that SI-reared mice are a useful animal model to study the pathophysiology\/pathogenesis of these diseases."},{"method":"In this study, diffuse optical imaging is used for the first time to investigate the joint attention experience in normal adults. Imaging studies were performed in the frontal regions of the brain (BA9 and BA10) in order to study the differences in the brain activation in response to video clips corresponding to joint attention based skills. The frontal regions of the brain were non-invasively imaged using a novel optical cap coupled to a frequency-domain optical imaging system.","background":"In the early development of social cognition and language, infants tend to participate in face-to-face interactions engaging in joint attention exchanges. Joint attention is vital to social competence at all ages, lacking which is a primary feature to distinguish autistic from non-autistic population.","conclusion":"The statistical analysis from 11 normal adult subjects, with three repetitions from each subject, indicated that the averaged changes in the cerebral blood oxygenation levels were different under the joint and non-joint attention based stimulus.

Carriers of the T-allele showed significantly higher ANGER scores than participants without a T-allele (F((1,837))=9.52, p=0.002). In a second step we validated self-report data of ANGER by investigating their relation to structural brain differences in anger-related brain regions using voxel-based morphometry.","background":"Recent findings have highlighted the importance of DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein, 32 kDa), a key regulatory molecule in the dopaminergic signalling pathway for dopamine related phenotypes like antisocial-behavior, drug addiction and schizophrenia.

Each individual mouse was introduced into a dark 120 cm x 120 cm arena and its behavior was followed for 10 min.","background":"Previous studies revealed that vestibular cues are crucial for exploration in the absence of visual cues. The working hypothesis of this study was, accordingly, that mice with vestibular dysfunction would become disoriented or unable to globally explore an unfamiliar environment. In 2- and 3-month-old mutant headbanger (Hdb) mice, stereocilia of hair cells are abnormally elongated, yet maintain partial staircase arrangement, suggesting some spared vestibular function at these ages.","conclusion":"Hdb mice were hyperactive and appeared to engage in local exploration, traveling in a restricted zone for a while and then shifting to travel in another zone. In contrast, Wt mice traveled across zones incessantly with fewer visits to recently entered zones. Thus, Hdb seemed to display local compared with the global exploration of Wt mice, indicating that they were less oriented in the global environment. In addition, Hdb exhibited numerous stretch-attends, which is suggested as a sign of elevated anxiety. Altogether, the three comorbidities of hyperactivity, anxiety, and disorientation can be presented as a syndrome associated with vestibular deficiency in this animal model, and serve in studying vestibular deficiency in humans."},{"method":"In the present study, the potential antipsychotic properties of NT69L were evaluated in a rat pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) paradigm. PPI is a measure of sensorimotor gating where a weak auditory stimulus, or pre-pulse, inhibits the startle response to a strong stimulus, or pulse. Schizophrenic patients exhibit deficits in their PPI response. This condition can be mimicked in rats with psychotomimetic drugs and the resulting PPI deficit is reversed by antipsychotic drugs.","background":"An imbalance between different neurotransmitter systems is involved in the pathophysiological processes underlying schizophrenia. Since the neurotensin (NT) system modulates the activity of several of these neurotransmitters, drugs acting upon the NT system may act as novel antipsychotic drugs. This hypothesis is supported by studies with NT in animal models. For example, intracranial injection of NT improves sensorimotor gating in rats [Feifel D, Minor KL, Dulawa S, Swerdlow NR. The effects of intra-accumbens neurotensin on sensorimotor gating. Brain Research 1997;760:80-4]. NT-mimetics, such as NT69L, have been developed which are more resistant to enzymatic degradation than the native NT peptide.","conclusion":"NT69L (0.1-10mg\/kg i.p.) reversed disruptions of the PPI response induced by the NMDA antagonist dizocilpine (0.1mg\/kg s.c.) for at least 1-h post-injection, but did not reverse disruptions induced by the dopaminergic agonists apomorphine and d-amphetamine (0.5 and 5mg\/kg s.c., respectively). These results confirm that NT69L possesses antipsychotic-like activity and therefore could be beneficial in the treatment of schizophrenia."},{"method":"Male juvenile Sprague-Dawley rats (n=10) were treated for 14 days with either PCP (5mg\/kg i.p.) or saline controls (1 ml\/kg i.p.). PPI responses and USVs were recorded on days 16 and 19.","background":"Deficits in pre-pulse inhibition (PPI-indicative of psychosis in humans) can be replicated in rats using the NMDA receptor antagonist phencyclidine (PCP). Ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs) produced by rats in response to acoustic startle are indicative of heightened anxiety; here we tested the predictive validity of USVs as an indicator of PPI.","conclusion":"PCP-treated rats showed decreased PPI performance on day 16 compared to controls; an observation that was unexpectedly reversed on day 19. Call parameters indicated that both treatment groups experienced similar levels of anxiety in response to the PPI paradigm on day 16. On day 19, the controls showed increased call duration and latency to onset (LtO) of calling, but decreased in the total number of calls produced compared to day 16. The calling period was significantly reduced compared to PCP-treated animals on say 19, whilst the LtO and duration were significantly increased. These changes were considered indicative of heightened levels of anxiety, most likely due to inadvertent fear conditioning (supported by reduced PPI performance) acquired during PPI testing. In contrast, the stability of USV characteristics emitted by PCP treated animals likely signified the detrimental effects of chronic PCP treatment on working memory. These results suggest that USVs are a valuable additional measure during PPI testing, helping to explain the unexpected results from our control group."},{"method":"Adolescent female rats were subjected to repeated ethanol or saline treatments, and spatial learning was tested in the Morris water maze. For comparison, adult female rats were subjected to similar ethanol treatment and behavioral assessments as for adolescent rats.","background":"Ethanol has been reported to disrupt spatial learning and memory in adolescent male rats. The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of ethanol on the acquisition of spatial memory in adolescent female rats.","conclusion":"Ethanol-treated adolescent rats took longer and swam greater distances to find the hidden platform than saline controls. In the probe trial, ethanol-treated adolescent rats showed a trend towards reduced time spent in the target quadrant, and made significantly fewer target location crossings than saline-treated controls. Adult saline-treated control rats did not learn the spatial memory task as well as the adolescent saline-treated rats. Although ethanol in adult rats increased both latency and swim distance to find the platform, in the probe trial there was no difference between ethanol-treated adult rats and age-matched saline controls. Ethanol did not alter swim speed or performance in the cued visual task at either age. Together, these data suggest that ethanol specifically impairs the acquisition of spatial memory in adolescent female rats. Since adult females did not learn the task, ethanol-induced alterations in water maze performance may not reflect true learning and memory dysfunction."},{"method":"In this study we evaluated the effects of the partial dopamine D(2) agonist terguride on the development of LID in hemiparkinsonian mice (unilaterally lesioned with 6-hydroxydopamine). First, consistent with the partial agonist property, terguride had 1000-fold higher potency than dopamine, yet producing one-third level of maximal activation of dopamine, as assayed by [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding. Furthermore, in the absence and presence of dopamine in vitro, terguride increased and decreased striatal [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding, respectively. Next, we found that co-administration of terguride (at 0.1 and 0.5mg\/kg, i.p.) with L-dopa (1.8 mg\/kg) daily for 14 days, significantly attenuated the development and expression of L-dopa-induced rotational sensitization. Furthermore, the cross-challenge paradigm revealed that chronic L-dopa treatment (but not terguride) sensitized locomotor response to the dopamine D(1) agonist SKF 81297 while chronic treatment with terguride (but not L-dopa) produced sensitized locomotor responses to the adenosine A(2A) antagonist 8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine (CSC). Importantly, the co-administration of terguride with L-dopa did not show locomotor sensitization to either SFK 81297 or CSC upon challenge.","background":"While dopamine replacement remains the standard pharmacotherapy for Parkinson's disease, chronic L-dopa treatment is associated with development of debilitating motor fluctuations such as L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID).","conclusion":"Together, these results suggest that co-administration of partial dopamine D(2) agonists with L-dopa may prophylactically attenuate L-dopa-induced abnormal behavioral responses such as LID."},{"method":"The present study investigates behavioral effects and the induction of c-fos mRNA in adult male predator naive mice caused by acute exposure to 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT), a component of the fox feces odor.

Systemic administration of MTEP (0.1 and 1mg\/kg i.p.) also dose-dependently attenuated cocaine cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. Systemic administration of neither MPEP nor MTEP influenced the reinstatement of sucrose seeking, which indicates that the effects of these compounds on cocaine seeking were reinforcer specific. Additionally, administration of MPEP (1microg\/0.5microl) into the nucleus accumbens shell, a brain region that plays a critical role in cocaine seeking, attenuated cocaine priming-induced reinstatement of drug seeking.

In contrast, while imipramine treatment reduced anxiety-like behaviors in the novelty-suppressed feeding test in both genotypes, it decreased aggressiveness in the resident\/intruder test and immobility in the tail suspension test in wild-type but not in heterozygous mice. Furthermore, imipramine induced a twofold increase of bdnf expression in the dentate gyrus in both genotypes, while bdnf(+\/-) mice displayed roughly half-reduced level for the same treatment.

During adulthood, rats under FR and those fed ad libitum were either subjected to PSD for 96h or maintained in home-cage groups.","background":"The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of food restriction (FR) and paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD), either alone or in combination, on sexual behaviours (mount, intromission and ejaculation) in adult male rats.","conclusion":"The results indicated that both FR and ad libitum sleep-deprived groups showed a significant decrease in performance and motivation to initiate sexual behaviour, reflected by the increase in mount and intromission latencies and decreased copulatory rate. FR associated with PSD reversed the adverse effects of sleep deprivation on the number of ejaculations and inter-copulatory interval. Testosterone concentrations decreased after sleep deprivation, regardless of food availability; while progesterone was significantly higher in the FR-PSD group only. In light of the limited understanding of the link between secretion patterns and neural-hormonal control of food availability related to sexual behaviour, our data indicate that sleep loss affects sexual responses, and FR was able to restore some of the sexual parameters investigated."},{"method":"This experiment examined the effect of lesions of the AcbC on inter-temporal choice using an adjusting-delay schedule. Rats received excitotoxin-induced lesions of the AcbC or sham lesions. They were trained to press levers A and B for food-pellet reinforcers in an adjusting-delay schedule in which the delay to the larger reinforcer, d(B), varied in accordance with the rats' choices between the two levers. In two experimental conditions, the reinforcers associated with levers A and B were 1 vs. 4 and 2 vs. 4 pellets.","background":"Previous experiments using progressive-delay schedules showed that destruction of the nucleus accumbens core (AcbC) altered rats' choice between food reinforcers differing in size and delay. Application of a quantitative model of inter-temporal choice suggested that lesions of the AcbC increase the delay-dependent degradation of reinforcer value (delay discounting) without altering instantaneous reinforcer value.","conclusion":"The AcbC-lesioned group showed shorter indifference delays to reinforcer B (d(B(50))) than the sham-lesioned group under both conditions. In confirmation of a prediction derived from the model of inter-temporal choice, the ratio of the indifference delays from the two conditions did not differ between the groups. Analysis of the cyclical changes in d(B) by Fourier transform showed that the period of oscillation and power within the dominant frequency band did not differ between the groups, suggesting that the lesion did not disrupt the rats' ability to detect short-term changes in delay of reinforcement. The results are consistent with previous findings that indicate a role for the AcbC in delay discounting."},{"method":"Here we explore the expression of odor-shock conditioning in the rat pup. Acquisition at post-natal day 6 (P6) leads to an approach response and at post-natal day 12 (P12) to an avoidance response when the retention test is 24h later. In both cases, anisomycin injected immediately post-acquisition induced a retrograde amnesia. Controls show that, in either case, short-term memory measured 4h after acquisition is not impaired and that anisomycin given after a 4h delay has no effect. Thus, at the two ages, memory involves a consolidation process.","background":"Ontogenetic modification of an early memory is relatively poorly understood. And an important question is whether the memory output is more determined by the age at acquisition or at retention?","conclusion":"The main result is the spontaneous reversal of the conditioned response from approach acquired at P6 to avoidance when tested at P13. This phenomenon is robust as it is observed in three conditions. Moreover, amnesia induced at P6 is maintained at P13. Results are discussed in terms of maturation and\/or competition of the memory traces."},{"method":"Male Syrian hamsters were administered AAS throughout adolescence and their brains were processed for double-label immunofluorescence of GAD67 and D2 receptors.","background":"Adolescent exposure to anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) produces alterations to various neurochemical systems resulting in an elevated aggressive response. Both the GABAergic and dopaminergic neural systems are implicated in aggression control and are altered in the presence of AAS. The present studies provide a detailed report of the interaction between D2 receptors and GABAergic neurons in the lateral subdivision of the anterior hypothalamus (LAH), a brain region at the center of aggression control.","conclusion":"Results indicate an increase in the number of D2-ir and GAD67-ir cells in the LAH of AAS-treated animals. Although there were several cells in the LAH colocalized with both GAD67 and D2 receptors, there were no significant increases in the number of double-labeled GAD67\/D2-ir neurons. Together, the data suggest the possibility of multiple GABAergic systems in the LAH allowing for differential inhibition of various neural systems. Given these changes in the number of GABAergic cells, it is likely that adolescent AAS exposure also alters the expression of GABAA receptors in brain areas innervated by the LAH. Thus, hamster brains were processed for immunohistochemistry and quantified for changes in GABAA-ir. Interestingly, adolescent exposure to AAS produced a significant decrease in the number of GABAA-ir elements in the LAH of aggressive hamsters. Taken together, results from the current studies provide a putative mechanism whereby dopamine stimulates aggression through removal of GABA inhibition in the LAH of AAS-treated animals."},{"method":"In the present study, we examined the associations of these polymorphisms with personality traits in 654 healthy Japanese. Personality traits were assessed by the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), and the DAT polymorphisms were identified by PCR-based methods.","background":"Dopamine transporter (DAT) plays a major role in terminating dopamine neurotransmission, which may be involved in the characterization of personality traits. Recently, polymorphisms of the promoter region (-67 A\/T) and intron 8 (40-bp variable number of tandem repeats, VNTRs) in the DAT gene were reported to affect DAT expression.","conclusion":"Regarding the -67 A\/T promoter polymorphism, the females without the A allele predictive of high DAT activity had lower scores of self-directedness (p=0.005) and cooperativeness (p=0.038) than those with the A allele. In males, none of the TCI scores was different between the two genotype groups. The intron 8 VNTR polymorphism did not affect any TCI score either in males or in females. The present study thus suggests that the -67 A\/T promoter polymorphism, but not intron 8 VNTR polymorphism, in the DAT gene affects personality traits of Japanese healthy females."},{"method":"Treadmill tests for 137 Sprague-Dawley rats were taped and scored. The structure of the scale was tested with principle components and factor analysis, in which six of the eight items accounted for 59% of the variance, while all eight accounted for 78%.","background":"One of the most widely used animal models for assessing recovery of locomotor functioning is the spinal rat. Although true differences in locomotor abilities of these animals are exhibited during treadmill testing, current measurement techniques often fail to detect them. The HiJK (Hillyer-Joynes Kinematics) scale was developed in an effort to distinguish more effectively between groups of spinal rats. Scale items were compiled after extensive review of the literature concerning development and analysis of rat locomotion and a thorough examination of the current tools.","conclusion":"Validity tests demonstrate that HiJK is measuring locomotor performance accurately and powerfully. First, the HiJK scale correlates highly (&gt;.8) with the widely used BBB scale and second, as shown with ANOVA, can distinguish between different groups of spinal rats. Reliability of the scale was also analyzed. Cronbach's alpha was shown to be .91, indicating considerable internal consistency. Additionally, inter-rater and intra-rater reliabilities were substantial, with correlations for most items reaching above .80. We believe that the HiJK scale will help researchers verify existing experimental differences, advance the field of spinal cord research, and, hopefully, lead to discovery of methods to enhance recovery of function."},{"method":"Recent advances in psychiatric genetics and a plethora of experimental data from animal studies allow us to suggest a new approach to gene-environment interactions in schizophrenia.","background":"The pathogenesis of schizophrenia and related mental illnesses likely involves multiple interactions between susceptibility genes of small effects and environmental factors. Gene-environment interactions occur across different stages of neurodevelopment to produce heterogeneous clinical and pathological manifestations of the disease. The main obstacle for mechanistic studies of gene-environment interplay has been the paucity of appropriate experimental systems for elucidating the molecular pathways that mediate gene-environment interactions relevant to schizophrenia.","conclusion":"We propose that animal models based on identified genetic mutations and measurable environment factors will help advance studies of the molecular mechanisms of gene-environment interplay."},{"method":"We examined in how far an impaired CRH system may influence the circadian rhythm of extracellular orexin levels in mice. The basal levels of orexin were collected unilaterally from the lateral hypothalamus over 24 h in conditional CNS-specific CRH receptor type 1 (CRH-R1) knockout animals and control littermates.","background":"Wake-promoting effects of orexins and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) are well documented. Neuronal interactions between these two systems and anatomical data point to a reciprocal influence of these neuropeptides.","conclusion":"No significant differences were obtained between both groups suggesting that under basal conditions the circadian variation of hypothalamic orexin is not mediated by CRH, at least not via CRH-R1."},{"method":"Thus, the present study was designed (1) to assess the combined effects of illumination (40-lx red or white light), closed wall type (walls made of translucent or opaque material) and extramaze space size (small or spacious experimental room) on rat behaviour, and (2) to investigate the effects of such parameters on the relevance of the maze for detecting the effects of diazepam orally administrated at the anxiolytic dose of 3 mg\/kg.","background":"Numerous methodological-related variables have been demonstrated to influence the baseline anxiety level of rodents exposed to the elevated plus-maze (EPM), raising questions about the sensitivity of this test for the detection of the effects of anxiolytic drugs.","conclusion":"Results indicate that illumination and closed wall type are two main independent parameters that are able to modify the open arm avoidance. Moreover, the closed wall type interacts with the extramaze space size since the reduction of the open arm exploration induced by opaque closed walls is two-fold stronger in the spacious experimental room than in the small one. Finally, the diazepam anxiolytic activity is significantly detected in our laboratory in specific EPM conditions (maze with opaque walls, use of a red light, maze located in a spacious experimental room). In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that an inappropriate baseline anxiety level due to the methodological use of the EPM can dramatically reduce the sensitivity of the maze for the detection of benzodiazepine-related compounds. This study also provides new insights into the perception of the EPM open space in rats."},{"method":"We now report that learning and long-term retention of this task were impaired in young malnourished animals, but not in young control, senile control, and senile malnourished Sprague-Dawley rats; young and senile rats were 90 and 660 days of age, respectively.","background":"There is a wealth of information indicating that the hippocampal formation is important for learning and memory consolidation. The hippocampus is very sensitive to ageing and developmentally stressful factors such as prenatal malnutrition, which produces anatomical alterations of hippocampal pyramidal cells as well as impaired spatial learning. On the other hand, there are no reports about differential effects of postnatal malnutrition, installed at birth and maintained all through life in young and aged rats, on learning and memory of active avoidance, a task with an important procedural component.","conclusion":"Extinction tests showed, however, that long-term memory of the malnourished groups and senile control animals is impaired as compared with the young control animals. These data strongly suggest that the learning and long-term retention impairments seen in the young animals were due to postnatal malnutrition; in the senile groups, this cognitive alteration did not occur, probably because ageing itself is an important factor that enables the brain to engage in compensatory mechanisms that reduce the effects of malnutrition. Nonetheless, ageing and malnutrition, conditions known to produce anatomic and functional hippocampal alterations, impede the maintenance of long-term memory, as seen during the extinction test."},{"method":"In the present study we investigated whether prolonged maternal separation really is stressful for rat dams by studying parameters known to be affected by long-term stress such as spontaneous motor activity, anxiety-like behaviour, adrenal gland weight and plasma corticosterone levels. Dams were separated from their litter for either 4 h (MS240) or 15 min (MS15) on eight random days during postnatal day 1-14, or left undisturbed (animal facility reared, AFR).","background":"Repeated, prolonged maternal separation has been suggested to model the development of a depression-like syndrome in rats. The long separations from the pups have been proposed to be stressful for the dams, which in turn could mediate the changes seen in adult offspring.","conclusion":"After weaning MS240 dams showed decreased peripheral activity and habituated slower in horizontal activity. On the contrary, MS15 dams showed more peripheral activity and less rearing activity compared to both AFR and MS240 dams when habituated to the testing apparatus, suggesting that MS15 dams are more anxious. The adrenal glands from MS15 dams weighed significantly less and plasma corticosterone levels were significantly higher compared to AFR and MS240 dams. These results suggest that repeated brief maternal separations from pups could be stressful for rat mothers, whereas prolonged separations are not. Since these results are in contrast to the current notion that the short separation procedure may be considered as a safe milieu, whereas the prolonged separations have been suggested to be stressful for both dams and pups, further studies in this field are warranted."},{"method":"Young adult male rats were trained in one trial inhibitory avoidance task (0.5 mA, 3 s footshock). On retention test given 48 h after training, the latency to re-enter dark compartment of the apparatus was recorded. In Experiment 1, verapamil pretreatment (5, 10, or 20 mg\/kg) enhanced the impairing effects of acute stress (which was applied for 10 min in a Plexiglass tube 30 min before the retention test) on memory retrieval. The applied stress increased circulating corticosterone levels as assessed immediately after the retention test, indicating that stress-induced impairment of memory retrieval is mediated, in part, by increased plasma levels of glucocorticoids. Verapamil did not change this response. In Experiment 2, pretreatment of an intermediate dose of verapamil also enhanced corticosterone-induced impairment of memory retrieval. In Experiments 3 and 4, acute stress or corticosterone did not change motor activity with or without prior treatment of verapamil, suggesting that stress or glucocorticoid-induced impairment of memory retrieval is not due to any gross disturbances in motor performance of animals.","background":"This study was designed to investigate an interaction between acute restraint stress and corticosterone with verapamil, a blocker of L-type voltage-dependent calcium (VDC) channels on retrieval of long-term memory.","conclusion":"These findings indicate that blockade of L-type VDC channels enhances stress or glucocorticoid-induced impairment of memory retrieval, and provide evidence for the existence of an interaction between glucocorticoids and L-type VDC channels on memory retrieval."},{"method":"On day 1 half of the rats were tested under low light and half under bright light. Two to seven days after trial one the same rats were repeatedly tested under the same light condition for five consecutive days.","background":"The defensive withdrawal test (DWT) is used to model anxiety-like behaviour in rats. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an aversive stimulus, bright light, affects the behaviour in this test. Additionally, the effect of habituation to the apparatus was studied. Both male and female Wistar rats were used to study whether sex differences exist in the DWT, as reported for other tests of anxiety.","conclusion":"The male rats showed a higher degree of anxiety-like behaviour when tested under bright light than under low light. In contrast, the behaviour of the female rats was not affected by changes in illumination. Male rats also exhibited elevated anxiety-like behaviour compared to female rats under bright light, whereas under low light conditions no sex difference was seen. Males in low light habituated much faster than males tested under bright light, whereas in females there was little difference in habituation between low and bright light. In summary, we found that bright light is aversive for male but not female Wistar rats in the DWT. Whether this is due to sex differences in light sensitivity or if females respond with a different behavioural strategy in response to bright light, which could not be detected in the DWT, remains to be elucidated."},{"method":"In this study, we investigated changes in rat brain activity during the FST using [F-18]Fluorodeoxyglucose micro PET.","background":"The forced swimming test (FST) is a widely used tool in the assessment of behavioral despair and prediction of response to antidepressants. However, the neural mechanisms underlying behavioral changes between pretest and test sessions of the FST remain unclear.","conclusion":"In both pretest and test sessions, the activity of the cerebellum and striatum increased, whereas significant deactivation was observed in the hippocampus, inferior colliculus, orbital cortex, and insula. The periaqueductal gray (PAG) region activated markedly in the pretest session, but did not activate in the test session. There was a significant increase in immobility and a decrease in climbing during the behavioral analysis test session. These results suggest that the PAG region may play an important role in the modulation of FST coping strategies subsequent to failure of the escape response during the pretest session."},{"method":"In this paper, we have investigated the effect of voluntary physical activity on memory and BDNF expression in mice with pilocarpine-induced epilepsy.

Two days after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, the affected mice (PR) and their running controls (SR) were housed with access to a running wheel for 28 days. After that, the spatial memory and the expression of the precursor and mature forms of hippocampal BDNF were assessed.","background":"Voluntary physical activity improves memory and learning ability in rodents, whereas status epilepticus has been associated with memory impairment. Physical activity and seizures have been associated with enhanced hippocampal expression of BDNF, indicating that this protein may have a dual role in epilepsy. The influence of voluntary physical activity on memory and BDNF expression has been poorly studied in experimental models of epilepsy.","conclusion":"PR mice performed better than PS mice in the water maze test. In addition, PR mice had a higher amount of mature BDNF (14kDa) relative to the total BDNF (14kDa+28kDa+32kDa forms) content when compared with PS mice. These results show that voluntary physical activity improved the spatial memory and increased the hippocampal content of mature BDNF of mice with pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus."},{"method":"On postnatal days 2-14, rat pups were separated from their dams for either 180 min\/day (handling and maternal separation--HMS180, modelling early life stress) or 15 min\/day (control handling and maternal separation--HMS15).

Following recovery, one group of rats from each litter underwent rapid amygdala kindling (RAK) epileptogenesis, while another underwent sham kindling. One week following this, rats were subjected to behavioural tests assessing anxiety and cognition.","background":"The incidence of psychiatric disturbances is elevated in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients.

RAK induced a potent anxiolytic effect as evidenced by increased % time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze, compared with sham kindled rats (p&lt;0.0001). This anxiolytic effect was also observed in the open field task, as evidenced by increased time spent in the inner area (p=0.010). Neither RAK nor maternal separation had any effect on cognitive function in the Morris water maze. We conclude that maternal separation stress accelerates limbic epileptogenesis in adult rats, and that RAK induces potent anxiolytic effects that are not influenced by such early life stressful events."},{"method":"The effect of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.1 mg\/kg intraperitoneally) on these behaviours was also examined.

Significant decreases in water and food intake were seen in female NPY-\/- as well as male and female PYY+NPY-\/- mice during the photophase. The effect of LPS to attenuate ingestive behaviour during the light and\/or dark phase was most pronounced in PYY-\/- and NPY-\/- mice. These findings attest to a circadian cycle- and gender-related role of NPY and PYY in the control of behaviours that balance energy intake and energy expenditure. Both peptides stimulate feeding and drinking to balance the energy demand that they generate by enforcing the circadian pattern of locomotion and exploration.

The clockwise orientation of the larvae correlates with a clockwise orientation of molecular structures during early development. Larvae with reversed embryonic asymmetries display a counter-clockwise orientation in the two-fish assay, suggesting that embryonic asymmetry and chiral behavior are regulated by the same developmental mechanisms. The developed imaging techniques may be used in large-scale screens to identify genes, pharmaceuticals, and environmental toxicants that influence complex behaviors."},{"method":"In this study, we examined the effects of a neonatal ibotenic acid lesion of the medial PFC on trace conditioning in adult rats, a form of classical conditioning. Since the PFC is also part of the neuroendocrine stress regulation, we additionally investigated the effects of chronic pubertal corticosterone treatment on trace conditioning to test the hypothesis that early lesions render the brain vulnerable to stress-like conditions in later life.","background":"In contrast to adult lesions, which usually result in immediate functional deficits, neonatal lesions of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) in rats can be compensated to some extent by functional tissue during ontogeny with sparing of function in many aspects.","conclusion":"Although there was considerable regeneration of much of the lesioned tissue in the medial PFC, a disruption of cortical layering and cortical thinning was observed in the adult brain. The chronic corticosterone treatment led to a decrease of corticosterone blood serum levels and reduced adrenal weights. Neither the neonatal lesion nor the corticosterone treatment alone affected trace conditioning; however, in rats that had received both treatments trace conditioning was impaired, suggesting synergistic effects between the lesion and the glucocorticoid treatment.

Upon reaching a criterion of greater than 80% correct responses, all subjects were tested in a mixed-trial attention paradigm combining four different stimulus durations within a single session (0.5, 1, 2, or 10 s). During attention testing, the percentage of correct responses decreased as a function of stimulus duration, indicating a performance decrement which parallels increasing attentional demand within the task.

In contrast, female offspring of dams that were not exposed to predator cues displayed a significant preference for the novel object (p=0.05) and a significantly higher preference score (PS) than female offspring of dams that were exposed to predator cues (F=4.23, p=0.05) indicating an impairment in object recognition memory in the latter. Conversely, there was no evidence of object recognition memory in male offspring, except for males of dams exposed to predator cues without shelter (p=0.03). These effects can be explained by an interaction between variations in maternal care and the stressfulness of the rearing conditions since a regression analysis revealed an inverse relationship between the level of licking-grooming and the PS, but only in female offspring reared by dams exposed to the predator cues (beta=-0.96, p=0.001). The present findings thus provide some evidence that early rearing conditions may affect cognitive abilities of mice.

This was accompanied by a decrease in the c-Fos expression in all cerebellar nuclei; with a corresponding increase in c-Fos expression in the PFC. DBS of the VL thalamic nucleus caused no significant change in behaviour or c-Fos expression in either region. The present study demonstrates that impulsive behaviour involves the cerebellar nuclei, possibly through a decreased selective attention caused by a disruption of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways through the MD thalamic nucleus."},{"method":"Ampullosporin A (amp) disrupted the retrieval of a well-trained conditioned reaction and normalized the behavioural effects of subchronic ketamine treatment in the social interaction test in a dose which showed only inconsiderable side effects. The experiments demonstrated that the substance did not antagonize the apomorphine (apo) induced hyperactivity. On the other hand, the locomotor stimulation induced by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 was nearly completely suppressed by ampullosporin A, supposing interactions with the glutamatergic system. Binding studies demonstrated no interaction with dopaminergic D(1) and D(2) receptors. However, amp can alter the activity of glutamate receptors.","background":"The potential neuroleptic-like effect of ampullosporin A, a new peptaibol, isolated from the fungus Sepedonium ampullosporum HKI-0053, was characterized using specific behavioural models and methods.","conclusion":"The results resemble characteristics of an atypical neuroleptic drug.

In contrast, atypical antipsychotics and new generation D(2)\/5-HT(1A) antipsychotics have low cataleptogenic potential. However, there has been no systematic comparative study on the effects of these different classes of antipsychotics in non-human primates, a species displaying a more sophisticated repertoire of behavioural\/motor activity than rats.","conclusion":"Haloperidol, risperidone, olanzapine, nemonapride and remoxipride induced, to different extents, an increase in unusual positions (a response akin to dystonia), some crouching and static postures. In contrast, clozapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone and aripiprazole produced much lower or no unusual positions; clozapine also produced marked increases in static postures and crouching. Among novel D(2)\/5-HT(1A) antipsychotics, SLV313 and F15063 augmented the number of unusual positions, albeit at doses 16-63 times higher than those of haloperidol for approximately the same score. SSR181507 and bifeprunox produced moderate static postures, little crouching and negligible unusual positions. These data provide the first comparative analysis in cynomolgus monkeys of EPS liability of conventional, atypical and novel D(2)\/5-HT(1A) antipsychotics. They indicate that the latter are less prone than haloperidol to produce CAB, and provide a basis for comparison with rodent catalepsy studies."},{"method":"In the present study, we investigated the comparative effect of both the isoforms of vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol and tocotrienol against chronic alcohol-induced cognitive dysfunction in rats. Male Wistar rats were given ethanol (10g\/kg; oral gavage) for 10 weeks, and treated with alpha-tocopherol and tocotrienol for the same duration. The learning and memory behavior was assessed using Morris water maze and elevated plus maze test. The rats were sacrificed at the end of 10th week and cytoplasmic fractions of cerebral cortex and hippocampus were prepared for the quantification of acetylcholinesterase activity, oxidative-nitrosative stress parameters, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta).","background":"Chronic alcohol intake is known to induce the selective neuronal damage associated with increase oxidative-nitrosative stress and activation of inflammatory cascade finally resulting in neuronal apoptosis and thus dementia.","conclusion":"From the 6th week onwards, ethanol-treated rats showed significant increase in transfer latency in both the behavioral paradigms which was coupled with enhanced acetylcholinesterase activity, increased oxidative-nitrosative stress, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels in different brain regions of ethanol-treated rats. Co-administration of alpha-tocopherol as well as tocotrienol significantly and dose-dependently prevented these behavioral, biochemical and molecular changes in the brains of ethanol-treated rats. However, the effects were more pronounced with tocotrienol. The current study thus demonstrates the possible involvement of oxidative-nitrosative stress mediated activation of inflammatory cascade in chronic alcohol-induced cognitive dysfunction and also suggests the effectiveness of vitamin E isoforms, of which tocotrienol being more potent, in preventing the cognitive deficits associated with chronic alcohol consumption."},{"method":"To address this issue, a CFC paradigm was used to test whether the serotonergic projections from the MRN to DH can influence CFC. Serotoninergic drugs were infused either into the MRN or DH prior to testing sessions in which freezing and startle responses were measured in the same context where 6h previously rats received footshocks.","background":"Independent studies have shown that the median raphe nucleus (MRN) and dorsal hippocampus (DH) are involved in the expression of contextual conditioned fear (CFC). However, studies that examine the integrated involvement of serotonergic mechanisms of the MRN-DH are lacking.","conclusion":"A reduction of serotonin (5-HT) transmission in the MRN by local infusions of the 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) decreased freezing in response to the context but did not reduce fear-potentiated startle. This pattern of results is consistent with the hypothesis that MRN serotonergic mechanisms selectively modulate the freezing response to the aversive context. As for the DH, a decrease in postsynaptic 5-HT receptor activity at projection areas has been proposed to be the main consequence of 5-HT(1A) receptor activation in the MRN. Intra-DH injections of 8-OH-DPAT inhibited both the freezing and fear-potentiated startle response to the context. To reconcile these findings, an inhibitory mechanism may exist between the incoming 5-HT pathway from the MRN to DH and the neurons of the DH output to other structures. The DH-amygdala or medial prefrontal cortex projections could well be this output circuit modulating the expression of CFC as revealed by measurements of Fos immunoreactivity in these areas."},{"method":"The present studies characterize the pharmacology and antinociceptive effects of a structurally novel P2X7 antagonist.

However, the mechanisms underlying these analgesic effects are unknown.","conclusion":"A-839977 also produced robust antihyperalgesia in the CFA model of inflammatory pain in wild-type mice (ED50=40 micromol\/kg, i.p.), but the antihyperalgesic effects of A-839977 were completely absent in IL-1alphabeta knockout mice. These data demonstrate that selective blockade of P2X7 receptors in vivo produces significant antinociception in animal models of inflammatory pain and suggest that the antihyperalgesic effects of P2X7 receptor blockade in an inflammatory pain model in mice are mediated by blocking the release of IL-1beta."},{"method":"We studied the effects of mild periconceptional undernutrition in sheep on side preference and cognitive flexibility in the offspring.

Based on a unique distribution of postmortem abnormalities in layer II of the anterior cingulate cortex and sectors CA3\/2 of the hippocampus, we postulated that afferent fibers from the basolateral amygdala to these sites may contribute to diminished GABAergic modulation in these disorders.","conclusion":"Overall, these studies support the view that postmortem studies contribute information for the development of empiric models of SZ, ones that can be used as translational tools for elucidating the functional changes that may be present in GABA cell subtypes their molecular regulatory mechanisms in this disorder."},{"method":"Antidepressant-like effects were evaluated based on the immobility time in the forced-swim test. GLP-2 (1.5-6 microg\/mouse, i.c.v.) significantly reduced the immobility time in a dose-dependent manner without affecting locomotor activity in the wheel running test and memory function in the step-down passive avoidance test. These effects were inhibited by pretreatment with metergoline (an antagonist of non-specific 5-HT receptors), parachlorophenylalanine (an inhibitor of 5-HT synthase), NAN-190 (an antagonist of 5-HT1A receptors), yohimbine hydrochloride (an antagonist of alpha2 adrenoceptors), atenolol (an antagonist of beta1 receptors), and raclopride (an antagonist of D2 receptors), but not prazosin (an antagonist of alpha1 adrenoceptors), ICI118551 (an antagonist of beta2 adrenoceptors), and SCH23394 (an antagonist of D1 receptors).","background":"In this study, we investigated whether glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) had antidepressant-like effects in mice, and whether these activities were associated with monoamine systems in mice.","conclusion":"These results suggest that GLP-2 exerts antidepressant-like effects in the forced-swim test in mice, which are associated with 5-HT1A, alpha2, beta1 and D2 receptors."},{"method":"In the present study, we evaluated Nrcam-null mice for sociability, social novelty preference, and reversal learning as a model for the social deficits, repetitive behavior, and cognitive rigidity characteristic of autism. Prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle responses was also measured, to reflect sensorimotor-gating deficits in autism spectrum disorders. Assays for anxiety-like behavior in an elevated plus maze and open field, motor coordination, and olfactory ability in a buried food test were conducted to provide control measures for the interpretation of results.","background":"NRCAM (Neuronal Cell Adhesion Molecule) has an important role in axonal guidance and the organization of neural circuitry during brain development. Association analyses in human populations have identified NRCAM as a candidate gene for autism susceptibility.","conclusion":"Overall, the loss of Nrcam led to behavioral alterations in sociability, acquisition of a spatial task, and reversal learning, dependent on sex. In comparison to male wild type mice, male Nrcam-null mutants had significantly decreased sociability in a three-chambered choice task. Low sociability in the male null mutants was not associated with changes in anxiety-like behavior, activity, or motor coordination. Male, but not female, Nrcam-null mice had small decreases in prepulse inhibition. Nrcam deficiency in female mice led to impaired acquisition of spatial learning in the Morris water maze task. Reversal learning deficits were observed in both male and female Nrcam-null mice. These results provide evidence that NRCAM mediates domains of function relevant to symptoms observed in autism."},{"method":"The intake of 0.1% saccharin and water, general motor activity, and myoclonic twitching activity were assessed following administration of three doses of ethanol (0, 0.25, and 0.5 g\/kg) while fluids were free available to the animals.","background":"The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that sensitivity of ingestive behavior of infant rat to the pharmacological effects of ethanol changes between postnatal (P) days 9 and 12.","conclusion":"The 0.5 g\/kg dose of ethanol attenuated saccharin intake in P9 pups and enhanced saccharin intake in P12 rats. On P12 some sex-related differences emerged at 0.5 g\/kg of ethanol, with saccharin intake being higher in females than in their male counterparts. Taste reactivity probe revealed that 0.5 g\/kg of ethanol increased taste responsiveness to saccharin on P12 but only to infusions presented at a high rate. The results of the present study indicate that ontogenetic changes in sensitivity to the effects of ethanol on ingestive behavior occur during the second postnatal week, with P9 animals being more sensitive to the inhibitory (sedative) effects on saccharin intake and P12 rats being more sensitive to the stimulatory effects of ethanol. We suggest that acute ethanol enhanced saccharin intake via sensitization of oral response to appetitive taste stimulation."},{"method":"In a rat hemiparkinsonian model induced by unilateral transection of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB), the effects of EA stimulation were investigated. EA stimulation at a high frequency (100 Hz) significantly reduced apomorphine-induced rotational behavior. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemical staining revealed that EA at 100 Hz protected axotomized dopaminergic neurons from degeneration in the substantia nigra (SN). Moreover, high frequency EA reversed the axotomy-induced decrease in substance P content and increase in glutamate decarboxylase-67 (GAD 67) mRNA level in the midbrain; however, it did not affect the axotomy-induced increase in enkephalin content in the globus pallidus.","background":"Electro-acupuncture (EA) is believed to be effective for alleviating motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease.","conclusion":"These results suggest that the effects of high frequency EA on motor symptoms of Parkinsonian rats may involve restoration of the homeostasis of dopaminergic transmission in the basal ganglia circuit."},{"method":"Both copulatory behavior and sexual incentive motivation were tested in male rats treated with 50mg\/kg of either EGb 761 or a vehicle (distilled water) by gavage for 14 days. Administration of EGb 761 increased the number of intromissions, but had no effect on the number of mounts, mount latency, intromission latency, ejaculation latency, or post-ejaculatory interval. In the partner preference test, the total duration of visits to estrous female rats in both of the groups was significantly different from the total duration of visits to sexually active males. EGb 761 treatment increased the number of ejaculations compared both to vehicle-treated controls on day 14 and the same group on day 0. In comparison with the controls, the EGb 761-treated group showed a significant increase in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing cells in the dorsal, but not the ventral, subregion of the MPOA, and significantly high dopamine levels in the MPOA.","background":"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether sexual incentive motivation and copulatory performance are regulated by different subregions of the medial preoptic area (MPOA). Sexual incentive motivation was measured by means of a partner preference test.","conclusion":"These results indicate that EGb 761 does not affect sexual incentive motivation, but facilitates copulatory performance in male rats, suggesting that the mechanisms responsible for sexual incentive motivation and copulatory performance may be associated with differential functions of MPOA subregions."},{"method":"The present study uses a reversible local neural inactivation method to examine the role of the mPOA in the regulation of maternal behavior throughout the postpartum period, particularly extending into the late postpartum, a little examined period. This approach avoids the compensatory plasticity in CNS that occurs after permanent lesions, and allows the repeated testing of same individuals. Early (PPD7-8) and late (PPD13-14) postpartum maternal behavior was evaluated in female rats following infusions of bupivacaine or vehicle into the mPOA or into control areas.","background":"Maternal behavior in rats undergoes considerable plasticity in parallel to the developmental stage of the pups, resulting in distinct patterns of maternal behavior and care at different postpartum time points. The medial preoptic area (mPOA) of the hypothalamus is one critical neural substrate underlying the onset and early expression of maternal behavior in rats but little is known about its specific functional role in the evolving expression of maternal behavior across the postpartum period.","conclusion":"As expected, mPOA inactivation severely but transiently disrupted early postpartum maternal behavior whereas infusion of vehicle or inactivation of adjacent control sites did not. Later in the postpartum period, however, transient mPOA inactivation facilitated the expression of maternal behaviors, highly contrasting the behavioral expression levels characteristic of late postpartum. Results strongly demonstrate that the mPOA is differentially engaged throughout postpartum in orchestrating appropriate maternal responses with the developmental stage of the pups."},{"method":"The rewarding or aversive effects of SP in the ACE were tested in conditioned place preference paradigm. 10 ng SP microinjections had positive reinforcing properties, while 100 ng SP had no effect. Prior treatment with NK-1 receptor antagonist could block the rewarding effects of SP, while the antagonist on its own did not influence place preference.","background":"Substance P (SP) can have positive reinforcing or aversive properties, depending on the dose used and the site of action in the brain. Experimental findings suggest that the amygdala is involved in reward-related processes. The presence of SP-immunoreactive fibers and cell bodies has been shown in the central nucleus (ACE) and neurokinin (NK)-1 and NK-3 receptors also could be found there.","conclusion":"Our results show that SP and NK-1 receptors play important roles in amygdaloid rewarding-reinforcing mechanisms."},{"method":"Six cats had implants placed in the optic chiasm (OC), lateral geniculate body (LGB), mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF), primary visual cortex (VC) of the left hemisphere, and left vagus nerve. Immediately after surgery, all cats presented anisocoria and relaxation of the left nictitant membrane. Also showed vegetative-type responses such as myosis, licking, and swallowing during VNS. Animals were then subjected to repeated luminous stimuli at intervals of 1 and 3s to cause habituation. The effect of VNS on the frequency and latency of the habituation episodes and the electrographic changes in the registered brain structures were analysed.","background":"The vagus nerve participates in the control and regulation of important autonomous functions, emotional tasks, and neural activity. Electrical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an approved procedure for the treatment of refractory epilepsy in humans. VNS has also been shown to improve mood complaints and cognitive function in both human patients and animals. Thus, the purpose of this study was to analyse and describe the effects of VNS on the development and establishment of sensory habituation and electrographic activity of the visual pathway in freely moving cats.","conclusion":"Latency analysis showed that VNS delayed the first habituation episode. VNS had transitory effects on the neural activity of the primary visual pathway structures, which caused a small but measurable delay in the establishment of habituation. In conclusion, VNS interferes with the development and establishment of visual habituation, an elementary form of non-associative learning, in freely moving cats."},{"method":"Here we compare the effects of chronic predictable restraint stress and chronic unpredictable variable stress on motor recovery after focal lesion in the rat motor cortex. Adult male rats were pre-trained and tested in skilled reaching and skilled walking tasks. Animals were assigned to daily treatments of either restraint stress or variable stress starting 1 week prior to lesion up to 2 weeks post-lesion. One group served as lesion only control.","background":"Previous studies have associated stress with poor outcome in individuals affected by stroke. It was suggested that the effects of stress depend on the stressor's type and strength.","conclusion":"The results revealed a distinct pattern of recovery and compensation of skilled movement. Animals exposed to predictable restraint stress had significantly lower reaching success at both pre- and post-lesion time points, and higher error rates in skilled walking when compared to lesion controls. Overall, restraint stress induced more pronounced motor impairments prior to and after injury than variable stress. Variable stress increased the number of attempts required to grasp food pellets and changed movement pattern performance. By contrast, variable stress improved limb placement accuracy when compared to lesion controls. The behavioural changes were not accompanied by differences in infarct size. These findings are in agreement with other studies reporting that both chronic predicable restraint stress and unpredictable variable stress influence the course of recovery following stroke, however, restraint stress might affect stroke recovery through a different route than variable stress."},{"method":"Naive male OF1 mice were individually housed for 12 days before being inoculated with tumor cells or vehicle. Six days later, tumor-bearing mice were inoculated with antalarmin (a corticotropin-releasing factor receptor antagonist), nadolol (a beta-adrenergic antagonist) or vehicle. All these mice were subjected to social stress by pairing them for 24h with counterparts selected for their high and homogeneous levels of aggressiveness. The pairs were only in physical contact for three 5-min periods, being in sensory contact for the rest of this period. One hour after social stress, serum corticosterone and IFN-gamma levels were analyzed in each experimental group. Fifteen days later, lungs were removed to determine the number of metastatic foci with their areas, and blood samples were taken to assess serum titers of corticosterone and IFN-gamma.","background":"It has been found that acute social stress in male OF1 mice produced a general immunosuppression and increased B16F10 tumor development. This study examined the effects of blocking either the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis or the sympathetic adrenomedullary (SAM) system on the impact of such stress on tumor development.","conclusion":"Both antalarmin and nadolol-treated mice developed significantly fewer metastatic foci with smaller areas than vehicle-treated subjects although only the group treated with antalarmin had reduced corticosterone levels. This study confirms that social stress has complex effects on immune system and tumor development that are not simply linked to corticosterone titers."},{"method":"In the present study, the association of this polymorphism with personality traits was examined in 633 healthy Japanese subjects. Personality traits were assessed by the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), and the CYP19 genotype was detected by a PCR-RFLP method.","background":"There have been several studies showing the relationship between sex hormones and personality traits. Cytochrome P450 19 (CYP 19, aromatase) is the rate-limiting enzyme for the conversion of androgens into estrogens, and it has been reported that the C\/T single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of CYP19 gene (rs10046) affects dispositions of estradiol and testosterone. Therefore, it is hypothesized that this polymorphism affects personality traits.","conclusion":"In males, the group with the T allele predictive of elevated levels of estradiol and decreased levels of testosterone had lower scores of harm avoidance than that without the T allele (p=0.015). In females, none of the seven TCI dimensions was different between the two genotype groups. The present study thus suggests that the C\/T polymorphism in the 3'UTR of CYP19 gene affects personality trait of harm avoidance in healthy males."},{"method":"We tested the specific role of GLP-1 receptors in synaptic plasticity and cognitive processes in a GLP-1 receptor knockout (Glp1r(-\/-)) mouse model. In an open field assessment, no general difference in exploratory and anxiety was found except for a small decrease in running speed was found (p&lt;0.05). In an object recognition task, Glp1r(-\/-) mice explored objects in a similar way to WT controls but did not learn to differentiate between novel and familiar objects (p&lt;0.05) while in an object relocation task, no impairment was observed. In a water maze task, Glp1r(-\/-) mice were impaired in the acquisition phase (p&lt;0.001), and also in the probe recall task (p&lt;0.05). LTP in area CA1 of the hippocampus was severely impaired in Glp1r(-\/-) mice (p&lt;0.0001). Paired-pulse facilitation was also impaired at 25ms interstimulus interval (p&lt;0.05) but not at longer intervals.","background":"Type 2 diabetes has been identified as a risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD). Insulin signalling is often impaired in AD, contributing to the neurodegeneration seen in AD. Previous studies have shown that the incretin glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) helps to normalise insulin signalling in type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 also plays important roles in neuronal activity and brain functions.","conclusion":"The results demonstrate that the murine GLP-1R plays an important role in the control of synaptic plasticity and in some forms of memory formation. The results shed light on the molecular processes that underlie the neuroprotective properties of GLP-1 analogues in animal models of Alzheimer's disease."},{"method":"In the present study, 32 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) and control groups, with 16 rats in each group. The CUS rats were exposed to 21-day chronic unpredictable stressors, and the controls were stress-free. After stress, 16 rats (8 in each group) were tested for spatial memory using Morris Water Maze, and 16 rats (8 from each group) were decapitated for detection of the three most extensively studied subgroups of MAPKs, ERK1\/2, JNK and P38, and CREB in the hippocampus.","background":"Much research has indicated that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signal transduction pathway is involved in the pathophysiological mechanism of depression. But as to the question of which MAPKs are more relevant to stress effects, there is no definite answer.","conclusion":"The results showed that there was no statistical difference in the body weight between the two groups. The CUS rats showed impaired spatial memory in MWM. Western blot of hippocampus showed that CUS significantly decreased pCREB and pJNK levels, but there was no statistical difference between two groups in CREB, ERK1\/2, pERK1\/2, P38, pP38 and JNK levels. Immunohistochemistry showed that the reduced pCREB occurred in the dentate gyrus, not in the hippocampus proper. In conclusion, this study highlights that the JNK-CREB pathway, not the P38-CREB or ERK1\/2-CREB pathway, in the hippocampus played an important role in the 21-day-CUS, and that the impaired spatial memory acquisition in the CUS rats can be restored to the level comparable to the pre-stressed state."},{"method":"In the current study we investigate the effect of hypoxanthine 3-N-oxide by exposing zebrafish to three different concentrations of this synthetic substance.","background":"Zebrafish, one of the preferred study species of geneticists, is gaining increasing popularity in behavioral neuroscience. This small and prolific species may be an excellent tool with which the biological mechanisms of vertebrate brain function and behavior are investigated. Zebrafish has been proposed as a model organism in the analysis of fear responses and human anxiety disorders. Species-specific cues signaling the presence of predators have been successfully utilized in such research. Zebrafish has been shown to respond to its natural alarm substance with species-typical fear reactions. However, the extraction of this alarm substance and ascertaining its consistent dosing has been problematic. A synthetic substance with a known chemical identity and molecular weight would allow precise dosing and experimental control. Previously, the chemical component, hypoxanthine 3-N-oxide, common to several fish alarm substances has been identified and has been shown to elicit alarm reactions in fish species belonging to the Osteriophysan superorder.","conclusion":"Our results show that the substance efficaciously induces species-typical fear reactions increasing the number of erratic movement episodes and jumps in zebrafish. We discuss the translational relevance of our findings and conclude that hypoxanthine 3-N-oxide will have utility to elicit fear responses in the laboratory in a precisely controlled manner in zebrafish."},{"method":"In order to assess the effect of MDMA on the acquisition of an active avoidance response, forty-five rats were divided in two groups exposed or not exposed to MCS. Rats also received chronic intracerebroventricular MDMA (0.2microg\/microl; 1microl), fluoxetine (2.0microg\/microl; 1microl) or saline solution (0.9%; 1microl).","background":"In despite the similarity of mechanisms of action between both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and MDMA (main compound of \"Ecstasy\") there are relatively few reports on the effects of the later on animal models of depression. There are many animal models designed to create or to assess depression. Mild chronic stress (MCS) is a procedure designed to create depression. MCS includes the chronic exposure of the animal to several stressors. After that, rats show behavioural changes associated to depression. In the other hand, the active avoidance task (AAT) is an experimental situation in which an animal has to accomplish a particular behaviour in order to avoid the application of a stressor. Animals exhibiting depression fail to acquire avoidance responses as rapidly as normal animals do.","conclusion":"Our results showed that the effect of MDMA depends upon the level of stress. MDMA treated animals showed better acquisition (F([2,37])=7.046; P=0.003) and retention (F([2,37])=3.900; P=0.029) of the avoidance response than fluoxetine or saline treated animals when exposed to MCS. This finding suggests that MDMA (and no fluoxetine) was able to change the aversive valence of the stressors maybe enhancing coping strategies. This effect could serve as a protective factor against helplessness and maybe post-traumatic stress."},{"method":"The present experiment sought to determine whether LL produces changes in affective responses and whether behavioural changes are mediated by alterations in glucocorticoid concentrations. Relative to conspecifics maintained in a light\/dark cycle (LD, 16:8 light\/dark), male Swiss-Webster mice exposed to LL for three weeks increased depressive-like behavioural responses as evaluated by the forced swim test and sucrose anhedonia. Furthermore, providing a light escape tube reversed the effects of LL in the forced swim test. LL mice displayed reduced anxiety as evaluated by the open field and elevated-plus maze.","background":"Individuals are increasingly exposed to light at night. Exposure to constant light (LL) disrupts circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, body temperature, hormones, and the sleep-wake cycle in animals. Other behavioural responses to LL have been reported, but are inconsistent.","conclusion":"Glucocorticoid concentrations were reduced in the LL group suggesting that the affective behavioural responses to LL are not the result of elevated corticosterone. Additionally, mice housed in LD with a clear tube displayed increased paired testes mass as compared to LL mice. Taken together, these data provide evidence that exposure to unnatural lighting can induce significant changes in affect, increasing depressive-like and decreasing anxiety-like responses."},{"method":"The present study tested the entrainment effects of fentanyl, an opioid agonist with a noted abuse liability, and haloperidol, an anti-psychotic dopamine antagonist without apparent abuse liability.

On the 31-h schedule, fentanyl produced an \"ensuing\" activity episode approximately 24h post-administration, but failed to produce an anticipatory episode 29-31h post-administration. In contrast, haloperidol injections failed to produce both pre-drug episodes on the 24-h schedule and circadian ensuing episodes on the 31-h schedule, and post-haloperidol suppression of activity appeared to mask the free-running activity rhythm.

It also produced thermal allodynia in response to cold (paw acetone test: 200% increase of allodynia score during week 3-5) and heat (42 degrees C tail immersion test: 15% decrease of withdrawal threshold, from week 2 onward). This stress also resulted in mechanical allodynia in the von Frey filaments model (60% decrease in threshold during week 2-5). However, such a stress regimen had no influence in the Randall-Selitto test of mechanical hyperalgesia, and in the tail immersion models of cold (4 degrees C) or hot (48 degrees C) thermal hyperalgesia, as well as cold (15 degrees C) allodynia.

We assessed the effects on neural development after animals had reached adulthood at postnatal day 90 by measuring the density of dopamine fibres in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (core and shell), olfactory tubercle, and amygdala (basolateral and central), and by labelling mitoses in the dentate gyrus by BrdU.","background":"Periadolescence is a critical period during which environmental stimuli modulate developmental neural plasticity. This includes the density of mesolimbic dopamine (DA) projections and the mitotic dynamic in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, both involved in central structures for emotional and cognitive functioning. Behavioural tests suggest that even short periods of stimulation can have lasting developmental effects on cognitive and emotional measures.","conclusion":"In experimental animals as compared to deprived controls, dopamine fibre densities were increased in the PFC and basolateral amygdala, decreased in the central amygdala, but not altered in the ventral striatum. Hippocampal cell proliferation was decreased. These results show that even a low level of experimental sensory stimulation during periadolescence triggers neural developmental processes, with lasting effects into adulthood."},{"method":"In the TnA, the highest MET dose elicited a short-lived hyperphagy, without affecting drinking or non-ingestive behaviours during the first hour after injection. In contrast, all MET doses promptly increased drinking when injected in the AI, without affecting feeding; this effect was still evident 3 and 24 h after the treatment. When injected in the TnA, the highest GR dose promptly increased both food and water intake; these effects persisted 24 h after the treatments. GR injections in the AI evoked long-lasting increases in drinking, but not in feeding. Injections of these drugs into other arcopallial nuclei evoked no significant ingestive effects.","background":"This study examined the acute changes in feeding and drinking behaviours of free-feeding and free-drinking pigeons, in response to local injections of metergoline (MET, 5-HT(1\/2) receptor antagonist; 7 and 20 nmol), GR46611 (GR, 5-HT(1B\/1D) agonist; 2 and 6 nmol) or vehicle, into two components of the arcopallium: the nucleus taeniae of the amygdala (TnA) and the arcopallium intermedium (AI).","conclusion":"These data indicate the presence of a tonic inhibitory influence of serotonergic inputs, partially mediated by 5-HT(1B\/1D) receptors, on feeding- and drinking-related TnA circuits and on mechanisms controlling drinking in the AI. Compared to data from the rodent medial amygdala, our results suggest that a tonic inhibitory 5-HTergic control of feeding (but not drinking) behaviour, mediated by 5-HT(1\/2) receptors and exerted in the medial amygdaloid area, may represent a broadly conserved functional attribute in the amniote brain, but probably involves many important taxa-specific neural mechanisms."},{"method":"a home cage analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms was performed using radio telemetry.","background":"One hallmark of neurological dysfunction is a reduction in paradoxical sleep (PS) time. To determine if adult rats treated neonatally with low dose domoic acid have altered sleep patterns,","conclusion":"Domoate treated rats spent significantly less time in PS than controls during daytime hours even though they spent the same total amount of time sleeping, and showed no difference in stage shifts into the PS stage."},{"method":"In the present study TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) was used to examine the contribution of activity-dependent coupling to dual-task interference during concurrent performance of a bimanual coordination task and a discrete probe reaction time (RT) task involving the foot.","background":"Performing two tasks simultaneously often degrades performance of one or both tasks. While this dual-task interference is classically interpreted in terms of shared attentional resources, where two motor tasks are performed simultaneously interactions within primary motor cortex (i.e., activity-dependent coupling) may also be a contributing factor.","conclusion":"Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that activity-dependent coupling within the leg corticomotor pathway was greater during dual-task performance than single-task performance, and this was associated with interference on the probe RT task (i.e., increased RT). Experiment 3 revealed that dual-task interference occurred regardless of whether the dual-task involved two motor tasks or a motor and cognitive task, however activity-dependent coupling was present only when a dual motor task was performed. This suggests that activity-dependent coupling is less detrimental to performance than attentional processes operating upstream of the corticomotor system. Finally, while prioritising the RT task reduced, but did not eliminate, dual-task interference the contribution of activity-dependent coupling to dual-task interference was not affected by task prioritisation. This suggests that although activity-dependent coupling may contribute to dual motor-task interference, attentional processes appear to be more important. It also suggests that activity-dependent coupling may not be subject to modulation by attentional processes."},{"method":"Here we investigated, whether diurnal changes in combination with immobilization stress have any impact on the dendritic morphology of layer III pyramidal neurons in the ILC. Prefrontal cortices were collected from control rats at two different time points of the diurnal cycle (12h apart), and from rats exposed to 1-week of daily restraint stress either during their active or resting period. Dendritic architecture and spine density of Golgi-Cox stained neurons were digitally reconstructed and analyzed.","background":"The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) participates in several higher order cognitive functions and is involved in the regulation of the stress response. The infralimbic cortex (ILC), the most ventral part of the mPFC, receives a strong afferent input from the master circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus. This fact raises the possibility that, similarly to stress, the diurnal rhythm may affect structural plasticity of neurons in the ILC.","conclusion":"We found that in control rats during the active period, the basilar dendrites were always longer and more complex, and had more spines than during the resting period. Similar although less pronounced diurnal differences exist in the apical dendrites. Stress affected dendritic architecture in a way that the diurnal differences either disappeared or became reduced in their magnitude. Our findings indicate that the diurnal rhythm has a unique impact on the structural plasticity of pyramidal cells in the ILC and that stress interferes with this form of neuroplasticity."},{"method":"the present study examined the effects of left vs. right unilateral DAergic depletion targeting the basolateral amygdala in male and female rats. We examined behaviour in the elevated plus maze over two consecutive days, and plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels in response to a separate 30min restraint stress.","background":"A growing body of literature suggests that sex differences exist in both rodents and humans in terms of the central processing of stress and emotion, and an important factor in this regard may involve differential hemispheric specialization. The amygdala has been shown to be functionally asymmetrical in both rats and humans and its involvement in stress and emotion processing is well documented. Given that amygdala function is importantly modulated by dopamine (DA),","conclusion":"Overall, females showed significantly more exploration of open arms of the plus maze than males, while not differing in general activity reflected in closed arm entries. Significant SexxHemisphere interactions were observed for all measures related to open arm exploration, as right amygdala DA depletion produced an anxiolytic effect in males, increasing open arm exploration, but reduced this behaviour in females. Moreover, open arm exploration was greatly reduced on the second maze exposure in males, but unchanged in females. A SexxHemisphere interaction was also found for plasma ACTH levels. It is suggested that the role of amygdala DA on stress-related behaviour and physiology reflects inherent differences in amygdala function dependent on both sex and hemisphere."},{"method":"Here we present a comprehensive phenotypical analysis of mice carrying a targeted mutation in the NPS receptor (NPSR) gene.","background":"Central administration of neuropeptide S (NPS) in rodents induces arousal and prolonged wakefulness as well as anxiolytic-like effects. NPS has also been implicated in modulation of cognitive functions and energy homeostasis.","conclusion":"NPSR knockout mice were found to exhibit reduced exploratory activity when challenged with a novel environment, which might indicate attenuated arousal. We also observed attenuated late peak wheel running activity in NPSR knockout mice, representing reduced activity during the subjective evening. These mice also displayed increased anxiety-like behaviors when compared to their wildtype littermates, although analysis of anxiety behaviors was limited by genetic background influences. Unexpectedly, NPSR knockout mice showed enhanced motor performance skills. No phenotypical differences were detected in the forced-swim test, startle habituation and pre-pulse inhibition paradigms. Together, these data indicate that the endogenous NPS system might be involved in setting or maintaining behavioral arousal thresholds and that the NPS system might have other yet undiscovered physiological functions."},{"method":"NVHL animals tested as adults were impaired in shifting to a new rule; an increase in perseverative errors suggested that this impairment stemmed from an inability to suppress the previously learned strategy.","background":"Set-shifting in a T-maze task was assessed in rats with a neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion (NVHL), a proposed animal model of schizophrenia.","conclusion":"The NVHL animals' performance is reminiscent of humans with prefrontal damage and patients with schizophrenia."},{"method":"Impact accelerated TBI was induced in anaesthetised rats by a modified weight drop method. TBI and sham-operated rats received either a chronic (14 days) regimen of escitalopram (5-20 mg\/kg) or vehicle, following which they were subjected to a behavioural test battery.","background":"Depression and anxiety tend to be the most prevalent conditions among the multitude of neurobehavioural disorders which cause distress in the survivors of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The objective of the present investigation was to examine depression-like and anxiety-like behaviour of rats following diffuse TBI.","conclusion":"The results evince the depression-like behaviour of TBI rats in modified open field exploration, hyperemotionality, socio-sexual interaction and elevated plus-maze exploration paradigms. In addition, an anxiety-like behaviour was evident in social interaction and marble-burying tests. Chronic escitalopram (10 and 20 mg\/kg) treatment significantly attenuated the TBI associated behavioural deficits. In conclusion, the aforesaid behavioural anomalies observed in TBI rats are analogous to comorbid anxiety and depression in humans. These findings substantiate the TBI rats as a candidate model of comorbid anxiety and depression."},{"method":"As expected, LH-stimulated animals readily learned cCPP tasks and developed self-stimulation behaviours following the rate-frequency procedure.","background":"The objective of this experiment was to examine the rewarding effect of electrical stimulation of the external lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBe) and of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) in concurrent Conditioned Place Preference (cCPP) and Brain Self-Stimulation Rewarding tasks.","conclusion":"As previously demonstrated, stimulation of the parabrachial complex generated rewarding or aversive behaviours in cCPP procedures. However, stimulation of this subnucleus induced consistent cCPP behaviours but not brain self-stimulation in rewarding LPBe animals. These results are analysed in the context of the different natural and artificial rewarding effects found in the LPBe nucleus."},{"method":"This study presents a qualitative analysis of the developmental progression of skilled movement in the rat by using a skilled walking task. A new rung bridge task was used to expose rat pups to a novel environment in order to reveal their potential capabilities. Ten rat pups were filmed daily from postnatal day 7 through postnatal day 30 as they explored the rung bridge task. Discrete changes in skilled and non-skilled walking in fore- and hind-limbs were evaluated by scoring seven categories and 24 subcategories of motor behaviour, including limb flexion and extension, coordination, posture, sensorimotor responses, distal control, and tail use in rat pups. Frame-by-frame analysis of ambulatory movement revealed six distinct stages of locomotor development.","background":"The rat is an altricial species and consequently undergoes considerable postnatal development. Careful analysis of the emergence and disappearance of motor behaviours is essential to gain insight into the temporal pattern of maturation of motor system structures.","conclusion":"The most significant transformation to mature gait patterns was found between postnatal days 15 and 19, and maturation of all motor behaviour was completed by postnatal day 27. The findings are discussed in relation to the maturation of underlying structures and their relevance to studies of brain damage."},{"method":"Therefore, the current study examined the relationship between cognitive performance and attentional modulation of PPI, using novel methods for the measurement of PPI. PPI was measured in 44 patients with schizophrenia and 32 healthy controls, across a range of startling stimulus intensities, under two attention set conditions. A range of neuropsychological tasks was also administered. Curves of best fit were fitted to the startle magnitudes, across the stimulus intensities, and a number of parameters were extracted from these curves, each of which reflects a different characteristic of the startle response.","background":"Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is suggested to reflect a basic inhibitory mechanism which regulates sensory input to the brain, preventing sensory overload and cognitive fragmentation. However, studies directly investigating the relationship between PPI and cognition have produced inconsistent findings; this is likely to be due to the use of uninstructed PPI tasks, and limitations with the methods for measurement of PPI and startle.","conclusion":"Correlations and quartile splits of the sample (highest versus lowest PPI) revealed that more PPI of response measures and less PPI of stimulus measures under the IGNORE condition was associated with superior performance in the colour-word subtest of the Stroop task. Further, more PPI of stimulus measures and less PPI of response measures under the ATTEND condition was associated with better performance on a memory task. These relationships appear to be mediated by common attentional processes active within both PPI and cognitive tasks, rather than by common underlying neurophysiological inhibitory processes."},{"method":"Rats were randomly assigned to normal and brain-ischemic groups. Those in the brain-ischemic group underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1 h. Fifty percent of the rats in each group underwent treadmill training for 14 days. The rest remained relatively inactive for 14 days and served as the control groups. Motor function was assessed by performing three motor tests (foot-fault-placing, parallel-bar-crossing, and ladder-climbing tests).","background":"Glutamate transmission is essential for learning and memory. Several studies have shown that exercise can up-regulate the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in normal brain, thus enhancing glutamate release through the synaptic-associated protein synapsin I in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of treadmill training on the release of these factors in the striatum and on the motor function in both normal and brain-ischemic rats.","conclusion":"Our data showed that after treadmill training, motor function improved significantly in both normal and brain-ischemic rats when compared with the corresponding controls. The levels of glutamate, BDNF, and p-synapsin I were also up-regulated by treadmill training. These results suggested that the overall responses to treadmill training were similar in both normal and brain-ischemic rats. The beneficial effects of treadmill training might be partly due to the involvement of glutamate in neuronal activity in both brain-ischemic and normal rats."},{"method":"In the present study, we utilized virtual environments (VE) to investigate age-related differences in participants' ability to determine linear distances, angular rotations, and angular displacement exclusively from visual input.","background":"Previous research has demonstrated age-related decline in spatial navigation skills. However, spatial navigation is a complex ability that requires the integration of many component processes that may show differential susceptibility to aging. In particular, successful navigation depends on the accurate computation of distance and direction from self-generated movements through the environment, known as path integration.","conclusion":"Results indicated that for shorter lengths, distances can be gauged from visual input alone with relative equivalence between older and younger participants. As distances increased, however, older individuals were less accurate. There were no age differences in estimating angular rotations. Requiring simultaneous integration of distance and rotation (in a triangle completion homing task) resulted in robust age-differences independent of the absolute amount of displacement. For older adults, accuracy in the triangle completion task was highly related to their rotation accuracy while returning to the point of origin, and less so to their distance accuracy. This study demonstrated age-related deficits in the ability to perform visual return-to-origin tasks and suggests one way in which elderly navigation performance may be compromised."},{"method":"The inhibitors effects were compared to those produced by haloperidol and clozapine. Male Swiss mice received a first i.p. injection (one hour before testing), of either saline, or N(G) nitro l-arginine (10, 40 or 90 mg\/kg), or 7-Nitroindazole (3, 10, 30 or 60 mg\/kg), or oxadiazolo-quinoxalin (5 or 10 mg\/kg), or haloperidol (1 mg\/kg), or clozapine (5 mg\/kg). Thirty min later mice received the second injection of either saline or methylphenidate (20 or 30 mg\/kg) or amphetamine (5 or 10 mg\/kg). One group of mice received intracerebroventricular 7-Nitroindazole (50 or 100 nM) followed by systemic administration of saline or methylphenidate (30 mg\/kg).","background":"Drugs that facilitate dopaminergic neurotransmission induce cognitive and attentional deficits which include inability to filter sensory input measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI). Methylphenidate, an amphetamine analog is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Given that nitric oxide (NO) modulates dopamine effect our aim is to analyze the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) inhibitors effect on PPI disruption induced by methylphenidate.","conclusion":"The results revealed a methylphenidate dose-dependent disruption of PPI comparable to amphetamine. The effect was prevented by either nitric oxide synthase or guanilate cyclase inhibitors or clozapine or haloperidol. In conclusion, methylphenidate induced a dose-dependent PPI disruption in Swiss mice modulated by dopamine and NO\/sGC. The results corroborate the hypothesis of dopamine and NO interacting to modulate sensorimotor gating through central nervous system. It may be useful to understand methylphenidate and other psychostimulants effects."},{"method":"Rats were kept on a small or large platform for 72 h. Their fronto-parietal electroencephalogram, electromyogram and motility were recorded during the 24 h rebound at the beginning of the passive phase. A similar period of a home cage group was also recorded.","background":"The single platform-on-water (flower pot) method is extensively used for depriving rapid eye movement sleep (REMS). Detailed comparison of sleep-wake architecture, recorded during the rebound period after spending three days on either a small or large platform, could separate the effects of REMS deficit from other stress factors caused by the procedure. A further aim of the study was to find the most characteristic REMS parameter of the rebound originating from REMS deficit.","conclusion":"The most typical differences between the two rebound groups were the increased cumulative time and longer average duration of REMS episodes without significant change in the number of these episodes of the small platform animals during the passive phase. Results obtained by cosinor analysis were in accordance with the findings above. Since we did not find any difference in the average duration of REMS episodes comparing the large platform rebound group and the home cage group, we concluded that the increased mean duration of REMS episodes is a selective marker for the rebound caused by small platform sleep deprivation, while other changes in sleep architecture may be the consequence of stress and also some sleep deficit."},{"method":"Here we examined the role of the early rearing environment in programming fear conditioning and extinction in adult male rats. Pups were subjected to maternal separation (MS; 360 min), brief handling (H; 15 min), or animal facility rearing (AFR) on post-natal days 2-14. As adults, animals were tested in a 3-day fear learning and memory paradigm which assessed the acquisition, expression and extinction of fear conditioning to an auditory cue; the recall of extinction was also assessed. In addition, contextual fear was assessed prior to cued extinction and its recall.","background":"The early rearing environment programs corticolimbic function and neuroendocrine stress reactivity in adulthood. Although early environmental programming of innate fear has been previously examined, its impact on fear learning and memory later in life remains poorly understood.","conclusion":"We found that the acquisition of fear conditioning to the cue was modestly impaired by MS. However, no early rearing group differences were observed in cue-induced fear expression. In contrast, both the rate of extinction and extinction recall were attenuated by H. Finally, although contextual fear was reduced after extinction to the cue, no differences in context-induced fear were observed between the early rearing groups. These results add to a growing body of evidence supporting an important role for early environmental programming of fear conditioning and extinction. They also indicate that different early rearing conditions can program varying effects on distinct fear learning and memory processes in adulthood."},{"method":"We administered chlorpyrifos (CPF), a model organophosphate pesticide to pregnant mice and identified visuospatial deficits in adult offspring using performance in the Morris maze. We then evaluated two strategies to reverse the effects, nicotine administration and transplantation of neural stem cells. Daily administration of nicotine prior to behavioral testing did not alter maze performance by itself, but completely reversed the deficits evoked by prenatal CPF exposure. Similarly, control animals grafted with neural stem cells in adolescence did not show any alterations in behavioral performance as adults, but the grafts completely reversed the effects of prenatal CPF treatment.","background":"Identifying the mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of developmental neurotoxicants enables the design of therapies that can potentially reverse neurobehavioral deficits in adulthood.","conclusion":"This study thus provides a model for the development and application of both pharmacologic and cell-based therapies to offset the effects of neurobehavioral teratogens."},{"method":"In the current study, mouse experiments were conducted using a new, totally automated device, the olfactory H-maze.","background":"The delayed reaction paradigm, consisting to discover two different rules consecutively (delayed alternation and non-alternation task) followed by a delayed reversal task, is a specific marker for the functioning of primate prefrontal cortex. Although several works in rodents report the use of operant delayed alternation tasks, in none of the studies mice with lesion of the prefrontal cortex were used in this paradigm.","conclusion":"Here, we show that unilateral lesion of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in mice induced similar deficits to those observed after frontal lesions in monkeys and humans. These pronounced learning deficits seem to come from difficulty elaborating a new rule and the inability to inhibit the previous rule, characterized by perseveration after prefrontal cortex lesion. The present results demonstrate that this very simple experimental paradigm using the olfactory H-maze presents the advantage to be fast (one training session) and well suited to assess the frontal functions in mice. It should be useful for testing pharmacological or stem cell approaches in order to reduce organic damages or gain insight into the cognitive functions of the frontal cortex using transgenic or gene-targeting mice."},{"method":"Older adult participants learned five different motor tasks. Two older adult control groups performed the same number of trials, but learned only one task.","background":"Many studies have demonstrated that aging is associated with declines in skill acquisition. In the current study, we tested whether older adults could acquire general, transferable knowledge about skill learning processes.","conclusion":"The experimental group exhibited faster learning than that seen in the control groups.

Thirteen female Long-Evans rats received selective lesions of the medial septum\/vertical band with 192 IgG saporin, and 11 received sham surgeries. Rats were trained to forage for hazelnuts in an environment with access to both environmental and self-movement cues (cued condition). Manipulations include altering availability of environmental cues associated with the refuge (uncued probe), removing all visual environmental cues (dark probe), and placing environmental and self-movement cues into conflict (reversal probe).","background":"Investigations using selective lesion techniques suggest that the septohippocampal cholinergic system may not be critical for spatial orientation. These studies employ spatial tasks that provide the animal with access to both environmental and self-movement cues; therefore, intact performance may reflect spared spatial orientation or compensatory mechanisms associated with one class of spatial cues.","conclusion":"Medial septum lesions disrupted homeward segment topography only under conditions in which self-movement cues were critical for organizing food hoarding behavior (dark and reversal). These results are consistent with medial septum lesions producing a selective impairment in self-movement cue processing and suggest that these rats were able to compensate for deficits in self-movement cue processing when provided access to environmental cues."},{"method":"Middle cerebral artery occlusion of 60 min followed by reperfusion for 7 days was employed in present study to produce ischaemia and reperfusion induced cerebral injury in mice.

Adhesive-removal somatosensory test was employed to evaluate somatosensory deficit.","background":"The present study has been designed to investigate the effect of amniotic fluid derived stem cells on focal cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion injury induced behavioural deficits in mice.","conclusion":"Partial occlusion of middle cerebral artery markedly impaired memory, motor coordination, sensorimotor ability and somatosensory functions as inferred from the results of elevated plus-maze test, adhesive-removal test and neurological severity score test. Intracerebroventricular administration of amniotic fluid derived stem cells\/embryonic neuronal stem cells significantly reversed the focal cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion induced behavioural deficit measured in terms of loss of short-term memory, motor coordination, sensorimotor ability and somatosensory functions. Therefore, it may be concluded that stem cells derived from amniotic fluid exert beneficial effect on the ischaemic brain to an extent comparable to the neuroprotective effect of embryonic neuronal stem cells."},{"method":"In order to better characterize the previously reported effect of CN on social behavior and to evaluate the extent to which the effects of the CN tend to be pervasive across different behavioral competences, we carried out both a detailed analysis of home-cage social behavior, taking into account the time of the day and absence\/presence of an established social hierarchy, and of learning and memory abilities in the water maze.","background":"We exposed mouse pups to an early social enrichment, the communal nest (CN), to study the effects of the early social experiences on adult brain function and behavior. CN, which consists of a single nest where three mothers keep their pups together and share care-giving behavior from birth to weaning (postnatal day 25), mimics the natural ecological niche of the mouse species.","conclusion":"Home-cage observations revealed that, when the hierarchy is established, CN mice display higher levels of social investigation behavior, namely allogrooming and allosniffing, compared to mice reared in standard laboratory conditions (SN). However, when exposed to cage cleaning, a stimulus challenging social hierarchy, CN mice display higher levels of offensive behavior. In the water maze test, CN mice showed a performance similar to that of SN mice. Overall, the present findings confirm that CN mice have elaborate social competencies displaying high levels of aggressive behavior when needed to set up or defend their own territory.

These behavioural changes reflect parkinsonism in this model. Additional thalamic lesions virtually abolished apomorphine-induced rotational asymmetry and improved sensorimotor response latency to tactile stimulation on the contralateral side. These data support the contribution of dysfunctional motor thalamic circuitry in rotational asymmetry and abnormal sensorimotor function in parkinsonian rats."},{"method":"In the present study, we injected either orexin or leptin, intracerebroventricularly, and their effect on olfactory performance was evaluated in two groups of rats, using a behavioral paradigm based on conditioned olfactory aversion.

They were then presented with different concentrations (lower than 10(-5)) of ISO-odorized water to compare their ability to avoid the ISO-drink.","background":"Numerous peripheral and hypothalamic peptides control food intake. Among these signals are orexin, an orexigenic molecule released into the olfactory bulb by centrifugal hypothalamic fibres and leptin, an anorexigenic molecule that is released peripherally and can pass through the blood-brain barrier.","conclusion":"Orexin decreased ISO-drink consumption, showing increased avoidance of the ISO concentrations tested which ranged from 10(-9) to 10(-7). Conversely, the administration of leptin resulted in a dose dependant increase in the odorized-drink consumption for ISO 10(-10). Orexin therefore increases and leptin decreases olfactory sensitivity. Orexin and leptin modulate the olfactory performance in a similar way as do physiological induced fasting and satiation and appear to be important factors in the interdependency of olfaction and food intake."},{"method":"In a first experiment in which training parameters were chosen to induce strong conditioning (five foot-shocks), we used a correlational approach and investigated whether post-training corticosterone levels were related to subsequent expression of contextual and\/or tone fear.

However, a positive relationship between circulating corticosterone levels and cued conditioning has also been reported. This study further investigates the relationship between corticosterone and fear conditioning by modulating the predictive value of contextual and discrete tone cues in separate groups of rats.","conclusion":"In the first experiment, the highest post-training corticosterone levels were obtained in rats trained with paired tones and shocks. Post-training corticosterone levels tended to be positively correlated with freezing scores during the tone-fear test and were negatively correlated with freezing scores during training although not during the context-fear test. In the second experiment, a post-training injection of corticosterone (3mg\/kg) had no effect on subsequent freezing to contextual cues and to a tone that did not predict shock, whereas it was efficient in increasing fear conditioned to a predictive tone. Globally, these results suggest that the predictive value of the conditioned stimulus may be the main determinant of the facilitatory action of acutely enhanced corticosterone in fear conditioning."},{"method":"On pnd 13 lesioned and control pups showed comparable USV baseline values; a brief reunion with the mother induced a significant increase in USVs in all rats (maternal potentiation).

The LI model was optimized for this strain particularly sensitive to stress (using both the CER and the conditioned freezing procedures) and characterized with typical (haloperidol) and atypical (clozapine and olanzapine) antipsychotic drugs administered either during the conditioning or the pre-exposure phases.","conclusion":"At all doses tested, diazepam decreased latent inhibition when administered during the pre-exposure phase (similarly to atypical antipsychotic drugs). Repeated restraint stress enhanced LI by blocking the CS-induced freezing in pre-exposed mice.

Therefore, in the present study we investigated the effects of bilateral injections of moxonidine into the LPBN on food deprivation-induced food intake and on meal-associated water and 0.3M NaCl intake.","conclusion":"The results suggest that signals generated during a meal, like dehydration, for example, not hunger, induce hypertonic NaCl intake when moxonidine is acting in the LPBN.

Changes in mu power were recorded while subjects viewed point-light biological motion videos, matched scrambled versions of these animations, and visual white-noise (baseline).","background":"Changes in power in the mu frequency band (8-13Hz) of the electroencephalogram (EEG) is thought to indirectly reflect the activity of mirror neurons in premotor cortex. Activation of these neurons by self-performed, observed or imagined motor actions is assumed to produce asynchronous firing and a reduction in mu rhythm oscillation (referred to as mu suppression) in sensorimotor cortex. A recent fMRI study by Saygin et al. [Saygin AP, Wilson SM, Hagler Jr DJ, Bates E, Sereno MI. Point-light biological motion perception activates human premotor cortex. J Neurosci 2004;24:6181-8] revealed that the premotor brain regions containing mirror-neurons are also activated in response to point-light human motion. The perceived movement of these light cues are integrated into one percept of a complete human action (e.g. jumping jacks), rather than seen as individual moving lights.","conclusion":"The results revealed that point-light biological animations produced mu suppression relative to baseline, while scrambled versions of these animations did not. This supports the hypothesis that the mirror neuron system is involved in inferring human actions by recovering object information from sparse input."},{"method":"We, therefore, investigated the effects of n-3 PUFA-depletion in rats (F2 generation) on the learning of an olfactory discrimination task, progressively acquired within a four-arm maze, and on the mRNA expression of some candidate genes, i.e., c-fos, Gir and glucose transporter (Glut1), which could reflect the level of cerebral activity.","background":"The long-chain polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are abundantly present in the central nervous system and play an important role in cognitive functions such as learning and memory.","conclusion":"We observed that DHA contents were dramatically decreased in the olfactory bulb, the piriform cortex and the neocortex of n-3-depleted rats. Furthermore, the n-3 deficiency resulted in a mild olfactory learning impairment as these rats required more days to master the olfactory task compared to control rats. Real-time RT-PCR experiments revealed that the training induced the expression of c-fos mRNA in all the three regions of the brain whereas Gir and Glut1 mRNA were induced only in olfactory bulb and neocortex. However, such an increase was less marked in the n-3-deficient rats. Taken together, these results allow us to assume that the behavioural impairment in n-3-deficient rats is linked to the depletion of n-3 fatty acids in brain regions processing olfactory cues. Data are discussed in view of the possible role of some of these genes in learning-induced neuronal olfactory plasticity."},{"method":"Female hooded-Lister rats (195+\/-12 g) received either vehicle (0.9% saline twice daily) or PCP (2 mg\/kg, twice daily) for 7 days followed by 7-days drug free.

Clozapine (1.0 and 5.0 mg\/kg) and risperidone (0.2 mg\/kg) but not haloperidol significantly attenuated the PCP-induced impairment such that animals again spent significantly more time exploring the novel compared with familiar object (p&lt;0.05). These results support our earlier work showing that acute PCP induces a robust object recognition deficit in female rats.

By the second week of tickling rats of both sexes developed a level of 50-kHz USVs that remained individually characteristic. During tickling the rats also emitted low levels of 22-kHz USVs. No correlation was found between the two types of USVs. In tests used in anxiety and depression research, tickling on its own had an anxiolytic effect in many experimental settings.","background":"Manipulation of juvenile rats in a way that mimics the rough-and-tumble play and resembles tickling elicits 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) that have been proposed as a measure of positive affect.","conclusion":"Significantly lower levels of [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding to the dopamine-activated receptor-G protein complex in striatum and serotonin transporter levels in the frontal cortex were found in female control rats as compared to males. These differences were eliminated by tickling. Rats which expressed high level of chirping (HC-rats) were similar to low-chirping (LC) rats in anxiety measures but had lower activity in an exploration test and lower sucrose preference. LC-rats adopted more active coping strategies in the forced swimming test. These findings suggest that there are individually characteristic 50-kHz USV response levels to tickling in rats, and that HC- and LC-rats are similar with regard to anxiety levels but have different coping strategies to novelty. The anxiolytic-like changes in behaviour that were brought about by tickling could be mediated by changes in dopamine- and serotonergic systems."},{"method":"Here, it is shown that rats did not learn a cross-modal object discrimination (requiring association of each object's visual appearance with its odour) when trained on the complete task from the beginning. However, they could eventually make the discrimination when trained on the component parts step by step, showing that they were able to do the necessary cross-modal integration in the right circumstances.","background":"Neurobiologists are becoming increasingly interested in how complex cognitive representations are formed by the integration of sensory stimuli. To this end, discrimination tasks are frequently used to assess perceptual and cognitive processes in animals, because they are easy to administer and score, and the ability of an animal to make a particular discrimination establishes beyond doubt that the necessary perceptual\/cognitive processes are present. It does not, however, follow that absence of discrimination means the animal cannot make a particular perceptual judgement; it may simply mean that the animal did not manage to discover the relevant discriminative stimulus when trying to learn the task.","conclusion":"This finding adds to growing evidence that discrimination tasks tend to encourage feature-based discrimination, perhaps by engaging automatic, habit-based brain systems. Thus, they may not be the best way to assess the formation of multi-dimensional stimulus representations of the kind needed in more complex cognitive processes such as declarative memory. Instead, more natural tasks such as spontaneous exploration may be preferable."},{"method":"Restraint stress (RS) suppressed both percent open arm entries and time spent in the open arms in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test. These RS-induced changes in EPM activity were attenuated by the NO mimetics, l-arginine, isosorbide dinitrate and molsidomine, in a differential manner. RS-exposed rats showed (a) increased lipid peroxidation (MDA) and (b) lowered reduced glutathione (GSH) and NO metabolites (NOx), in brain homogenates of these animals. Pretreatment with the NO mimetics also differentially influenced RS-induced changes in brain oxidative stress markers.","background":"The present study evaluated the effects of NO mimetics on stress-induced neurobehavioral changes and the possible involvement of ROS-RNS interactions in rats.","conclusion":"The results suggest that NO may protect against stress-induced anxiogenic behavior and oxidative injury in the brain and highlight the significance of ROS-RNS interactions."},{"method":"To improve our knowledge of the pharmacology of pethidine, the aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the nociception of r\/m HK and pethidine by comparing it with that of r\/m HK-1 and morphine.","background":"We have recently reported that rat\/mouse hemokinin-1 (r\/m HK-1), a mammalian tachykinin, produced dose- and time-related antinociceptive effects at the supraspinal level via activating NK(1) receptors. Moreover, r\/m HK-1 remarkably enhanced both the antinociceptive extent and duration of morphine administered at the peripheral and supraspinal level through a convergence of pharmacological effects of opioid-responsive neurons. Pethidine hydrochloride is an important narcotic analgesic, which acts as an opiate agonist and has pharmacological effects similar to morphine.","conclusion":"Our data showed that r\/m HK-1 remarkably enhanced the antinociceptive extent of pethidine administered at the peripheral level, but not at the supraspinal level. These antinociceptive effects were blocked by prior treatment with the classical opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, indicating that the potentiated analgesic effect is mediated by opioid-responsive neurons. Differences in the antinociceptive activity of pethidine and morphine in combination with r\/m HK-1, arise because there are differences in the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of pethidine and morphine, particularly their lipophilicity.

These animals displayed apomorphine-induced contralateral rotational behavior, when examined on the 16th day.","conclusion":"The recovery was visible for about 17 days, thereafter the behavioral bias reappeared. The present results indicate that dopamine released from the polymer matrices alleviates behavioral bias in experimental parkinsonism, implying use of such technologies as an alternative method for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

In terms of translating research in animal models to treatments involving exercise in Alzheimer's disease patients, it is critical to evaluate exercise intervention at time points that address not only prevention, but also treatment of cognitive decline.","conclusion":"Significant impairments were observed in the sedentary TG mice compared to WT in reference\/long-term and working\/short-term memory, as well as in probe trials. Exercised TG mice demonstrated improvements in memory, which made them indistinguishable from WT mice on all tasks. In addition, animals provided with an immobile wheel exhibited improvement in some, but not all cognitive measures.

Bilateral BACL microinjection (128 pmol), but not MUSC, also increased the head-dipping frequency over the open arms of the EPM, another representative behaviour of anxiety, but negatively correlated with it. In addition to anxiolysis, the present study also showed that the microinjection of MUSC and BACL agonists into rostral sites of the medial Acb shell (AP, +1.2 to +1.6) increased food intake significantly whereas drinking behaviour kept unchanged. Both doses of MUSC and BACL also decreased feeding latency. BACL but not MUSC dose-dependently increased food length.","background":"This study investigated the effect of GABAA (muscimol, MUSC) and GABAB (baclofen, BACL) agonist receptors microinjected into medial accumbens shell on feeding and the level of fear in free-feeding rats submitted to the elevated plus-maze (EPM), an animal model of anxiety.","conclusion":"The data indicated a putative role of GABA receptors (especially GABAB) in the medial Acb shell for anxiety modulation in rats."},{"method":"The present study tested the differential implication of dopaminergic systems in depressive-like behavior in rats and its response to l-Dopa and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram.

Rats treated with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammation failed to demonstrate a significant increase in paw stamping behavior.

The BALB\/cByJ mice appeared more anxious than C57BL\/6ByJ mice, exhibiting greater reluctance to step-down from a platform and a greater startle response. Although the F(1) behavior generally resembled that of the C57BL\/6ByJ parent strain, in the step-down test the influence of maternal factors were initially evident among the F(1) mice (particularly males) with a BALB\/cByJ dam. However, over trials the C57BL\/6ByJ-like behavior came to predominate. BALB\/cByJ mice also exhibited greater plasma corticosterone elevations, 5-HT utilization in the central amygdala (CeA), and greater NE turnover in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). Interestingly, among the F(1)'s corticosterone and 5-HIAA in the CeA resembled that of the BALB\/cByJ parent strain, whereas MHPG accumulation in the PVN was more like that of C57BL\/6ByJ mice. It seems that, to some extent, maternal factors influenced anxiety responses in the hybrids, but did not influence the corticosterone or the monoamine variations. The inheritance profiles suggest that anxiety was unrelated to either the corticosterone or monoamine changes."},{"method":"Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of long-term continuous enrichment in young (3 months), middle-aged (15 months), and aged (21 months) male C57BL\/6 mice.

Analysis of gene expression revealed a 10-fold increase of nociceptin precursor and 4-fold increase of the NOP receptor mRNAs contents in the hippocampus of CBy mice kept in crowded conditions compared to those housed individually. In B6 mice, mRNA level of the peptide precursor remained unchanged, while that of the receptor was increased by 2-fold under crowding compared to individual housing. No significant changes were detected in 129S2 mice. These findings show that social housing may be important environmental stress factor in mice depending on the strain.

Their biological function is to deter predators and warn relatives of danger. Despite this important function of alarm calls, the development of alarm call recognition is poorly understood.","conclusion":"Our data show that rats learned quickly to associate the 22 kHz calls with aversive stimuli. Interestingly, the animals were more reluctant to extinguish this memory, and this information retained longer in memory than in the case of other types of calls and ultrasonic stimuli. We, therefore, conclude that rats are predisposed to acquire adaptive defensive behaviour in response to alarm calls.

Although there are exceptions, on balance these data suggest that PPI is sensitive to sex-specific neurosteroids; in contrast, most studies with mice have not replicated this effect.","conclusion":"Both PPI and ASR levels were significantly reduced in pre-menopausal females compared to young males, but did not differ between post-menopausal females and old males. The observed PPI decrement in young female mice compared to young males agrees with one previous report in young C57BL\/6J mice as well as the majority of studies with human subjects and some strains of rats. The absence of a sex difference in PPI for old mice is consistent with the hypothesis that PPI is affected by reproductive hormones present at high levels only in pre-menopausal females. We note that this effect size for PPI is small, perhaps consistent with reports that the PPI decrement in females is restricted to certain times within the menstrual cycle in women and the estrous cycle in rats. The negative findings previously reported in the mouse can be attributed to the small effect size and to procedural differences, including stimulus conditions, and the different strains and ages of mice."},{"method":"These wayfinding problems after TBI were investigated using a virtual simulation of a Morris Water Maze (MWM), a standard test of hippocampal function in laboratory animals. The virtual environment consisted of a large virtual arena in a very large virtual room whose walls provided views of a naturalistic landscape.

The proximal objects allowed participants to use egocentric (body-centered) navigational strategies that rely on relatively simple stimulus-response associations. The absence of proximal cues forced the participants to rely on distal features of the environment (room walls, landscape elements) and tested their ability to use allocentric (world-based) navigational strategies requiring cognitive mapping.","background":"Navigation in real environments is often impaired by traumatic brain injury (TBI). These deficits in wayfinding appear to be due to disruption of cognitive processes underlying navigation and may in turn be due to damage to the hippocampus and frontal lobes.","conclusion":"Results indicated that the navigation of TBI survivors was not impaired when the proximal cues were present but was impaired when proximal cues were absent.

Male and female rats were given 1 daily injection of 0 or 2mg\/kg methamphetamine or not handled from PD21-35 and then tested as adults (PD95) in the Morris water maze.","background":"Exposure to methamphetamine early in life can have lasting effects on cognitive processes. The maturation of neurotransmitter systems targeted by methamphetamine differs by gender during childhood and preadolescence, which could lead to differential long-term effects of early drug exposure.","conclusion":"In general, male rats performed better than female rats in the water maze task regardless of treatment group. Female rats exposed to methamphetamine from PD21-35 had shorter latencies and took more direct paths to the hidden platform compared to control females during the 4 days of acquisition training and when the hidden platform was moved each day on matching to place trials. Male rats exposed to methamphetamine swam a shorter distance to the hidden platform on the first day of acquisition training, similar to the methamphetamine exposed females. However, the methamphetamine exposed males performed more poorly compared to control males in the matching to place trials. Overall, the current study found that methamphetamine exposure during preadolescence has long-term effects on spatial memory in a gender specific manner. These findings may contribute to our general understanding of the long-term effects of psychostimulant exposure at early developmental stages."},{"method":"Twelve subjects with normal gustatory function and eight patients suffering from hypo- to ageusia underwent one fMRI run each in a 1.5 T scanner where they received liquid gustatory stimuli. fMRI analyses were performed by means of SPM2.","background":"Aim was to investigate differences in the central-nervous processing of gustatory stimuli between normogeusic subjects and patients with taste disorders.","conclusion":"Across all participants clusters of activated voxels were mainly found in orbitofrontal and insular regions of interest. Even those patients who did not perceive any stimuli showed some activation of gustatory centers. Group comparisons revealed higher activation of the insular and orbitofrontal cortices in patients compared to the group of healthy subjects. While further studies are needed, this finding may be interpreted in terms of enhanced neuronal recruitment due to functional impairment in patients with gustatory loss. It may ultimately prove useful in terms of the prognostic evaluation of individual patients."},{"method":"In the present study, we generated a line of mice with targeted disruption of the PGRN gene, and investigated male sexual behaviour, aggression and anxiety.","background":"Sexual differentiation of the brain in rodents is achieved by estrogens, which are converted from androgens in the brain, during the perinatal period. We have identified the progranulin (PGRN) gene as one of the sex steroid-inducible genes that may be involved in masculinization of the rat brain.","conclusion":"PGRN-deficient mice exhibited a decrease in ejaculation incidence, while the latency and frequency of both mount and intromission were unchanged. For the aggressive behaviour test, the resident-intruder paradigm was used, and PGRN-deficient mice exhibited enhanced aggressiveness. In wild-type mice, males exhibited lower levels of anxiety than females by the open field test, while male PGRN-deficient mice exhibited an elevated level of anxiety and sex difference in anxiety was not observed. In addition, mRNA expression of the serotonergic receptor 5-HT1A, which could be related to the inhibition of aggression and anxiety, was significantly reduced in the hippocampus of PGRN-deficient mice after aggressive encounters. On the other hand, deficiency of the PGRN gene did not affect serum testosterone concentrations. These results suggest that PGRN gene plays a role in establishing sexual dimorphic behaviours at least partially by modulating the brain serotonergic system."},{"method":"Using an autoshaping procedure in which lever (conditioned stimulus) presentation was immediately followed by the response-independent delivery of a food pellet (unconditioned stimulus), rats were first characterized as STs or GTs and subsequently studied for the acute psychomotor response to cocaine and the propensity for cocaine-induced psychomotor sensitization.","background":"When a discrete cue (a \"sign\") is presented repeatedly in anticipation of a food reward the cue can become imbued with incentive salience, leading some animals to approach and engage it, a phenomenon known as \"sign-tracking\" (the animals are sign-trackers; STs). In contrast, other animals do not approach the cue, but upon cue presentation go to the location where food will be delivered (the goal). These animals are known as goal-trackers (GTs). It has been hypothesized that individuals who attribute excessive incentive salience to reward-related cues may be especially vulnerable to develop compulsive behavioral disorders, including addiction. We were interested, therefore, in whether individual differences in the propensity to sign-track are associated with differences in responsivity to cocaine.","conclusion":"We found that GTs were more sensitive than STs to the acute locomotor activating effects of cocaine, but STs showed a greater propensity for psychomotor sensitization upon repeated treatment. These data suggest that individual differences in the tendency to attribute incentive salience to a discrete reward-related cue, and to approach and engage it, are associated with susceptibility to a form of cocaine-induced plasticity that may contribute to the development of addiction."},{"method":"The aim of this work was to perform a 3D kinematic analysis of both hind- and forelimb during overground and ladder walking, to study qualitative and quantitative locomotor characteristics in different modes of locomotion.

The afferent feedback from peripheral receptors allows the animal to correct for disturbances that occur during walking, while supraspinal structures are important for locomotion in demanding situations such as ladder walking. Such walking, by regards to the control needed for accuracy of movements, is now widely used for description of consequences of nervous system dysfunction on motor performance. It is important to have a good knowledge of the changes in kinematic parameters according to walking conditions, since it might reflect different neural mechanisms.","conclusion":"Results indicate that kinematic and electromyographic characteristics of locomotion are dependent on the type of support. Changes were more obvious for hindlimb than for forelimb. Velocity, stride length and tibialis anterior burst duration were lower on ladder than on runway. In addition, during ladder walking, a protraction was noticed, rats bring their feet more rostral at the end of the swing phase.

The rats received multiple exposures to the sample object during the learning phase--5 min per day on 5 consecutive days.","background":"Damage to the perirhinal cortex (PRh) in rats impairs anterograde object-recognition memory after retention intervals of up to several hours, but there is little direct evidence to link PRh function to object-recognition abilities after substantially longer intervals that span several days or weeks.","conclusion":"Control rats displayed a significant novel-object preference after both retention intervals, indicating recognition of the sample object, whereas the rats with PRh lesions displayed a significant preference after the 24-h interval, but not after the 3-week interval. When the learning phase of the trial was shortened to a single 5-min session, the PRh group was impaired in the 24-h condition. The findings indicate that the disruptive effects of PRh damage on anterograde object recognition persist over very long postlearning intervals. The results indicate further that object recognition impairments following PRh damage are not ubiquitous, and that learning conditions play a significant role in determining the subsequent recognition performance in rats with PRh damage."},{"method":"A 2-experiment study was conducted with the goal of analyzing whether these differences in SNC can also be extended to a different experimental paradigm. Food-deprived RHA and RLA female rats were exposed to a straight alley, recording the latency (DV) between leaving the start box and reaching the food available in the goal box at the end of the alley.

This has been interpreted as possible lateralization of the perception mechanisms for magnetic cues in favour of the right eye. Recent discovery of magnetic compass orientation in domestic chicks, a species in which lateralization has been well studied, has made available a model system in which to explore these lateralized processes more fully.","conclusion":"In a magnetic field with North shifted by 90 degrees , chicks using their right eye oriented according to magnetic cues, whereas chicks using the left eye did not, but continued to prefer the original direction. Analysis of the times taken to respond indicated longer latencies in the chicks using their left eye, suggesting a possible conflict between cues. The different behaviour of the chicks using their left eye might not be a matter of a right eye-left hemisphere specialization for detecting magnetic directions, but of hemispheric specialization for attending to specific types of cues."},{"method":"Here, electrical stimulation (1s, 60 Hz) of the rat dorsal hippocampus inhibited defense in the elevated plus maze (increased open arm exploration) and shock-probe burying test (reduced burying duration), while ventral hippocampal stimulation had no effects.","background":"Recent evidence indicates that the hippocampus contributes to the control of defensive behaviors in rodents.","conclusion":"Thus, the dorsal hippocampus may play an important role in modulating a range of defensive strategies."},{"method":"This paper examines side-by-side human psychiatric and otovestibular phenotypes with animal experimentation data, and outlines future directions of translational research in this field.

Paralleling human clinical and non-clinical data, mounting genetic, pharmacological and behavioral evidence confirms that animal anxiety interplays and co-exists with vestibular\/balance deficits.

Overall, the overlap between anxiety and balance disorders emerges as an important phenomenon in both animal and clinical studies, and may contribute markedly to the complexity of behavioral and physiological phenotypes. Animal experimental models that focus on the interplay between anxiety and vestibular disorders are needed to improve our understanding of this important biomedical problem."},{"method":"In the present study, we investigated whether d-serine or a glycine transporter inhibitor N-[3-(4'-fluorophenyl)-3-(4'-phenylphenoxy)propyl]sarcosine (NFPS), both of which enhance NMDA receptor function, could improve MK-801-induced cognitive deficits in rats, and compared their effects with those of the atypical antipsychotic clozapine and of the typical antipsychotic haloperidol. To assess cognitive function, we used a novel object recognition test in rats that measured spontaneous exploratory activity of a novel object when paired with a familiar object. We then evaluated the effects of the compounds on cognitive deficits induced by treatment with MK-801, the NMDA receptor antagonist. Pretreatment with clozapine (1, 5 mg\/kg, i.p.) but not haloperidol (0.03, 0.1 mg\/kg, i.p.) significantly improved MK-801-induced cognitive deficits. Pretreatment with D-serine at 800 mg\/kg (i.p.) or NFPS (0.3, 1 mg\/kg, i.p.) significantly improved MK-801-induced cognitive deficits under this test paradigm.","background":"Compounds enhancing N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor function have been reported to improve cognitive deficits. Since cognitive deficits are considered to be the core symptom of schizophrenia, enhancing NMDA receptor function represents a promising approach to treating schizophrenia.","conclusion":"These findings suggest that impaired preference for novel objects induced by MK-801 in the novel object recognition test could be a useful animal model for evaluating the efficacy of compounds targeting the cognitive deficits observed in schizophrenic patients. The results also suggest that enhancing NMDA receptor function is an effective way for treating the cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia."},{"method":"The present study assessed behavioural and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) dopamine responses utilizing in vivo microdialysis during acquisition and expression of a conditioned fear response. In two independent experiments, rats were presented with either two or nine tone-shock pairings during formation of a conditioned fear response. In the second experiment, rats were pre-treated with repeated injections of either amphetamine or saline over a 6-day period and tested during withdrawal.","background":"Neurochemical studies have shown that mesocortical dopamine projections are particularly responsive in aversive situations such as fear conditioning.","conclusion":"Amphetamine pre-treatment as well as the conditioning procedure itself potentiated an increase in dopamine levels during formation, but not expression of a conditioned fear response. Locomotor activity induced by an amphetamine challenge (1mg\/kg) was also enhanced in pre-treated amphetamine compared to saline pre-treated animals (experiment two). However, mPFC dopamine response to amphetamine challenge did not differ between treatment groups. We conclude that while the exact role of mPFC dopamine in behavioural sensitization is yet to be determined, mPFC dopamine release may underlie the increased fear response during acquisition but not expression of fear response."},{"method":"Single neurons were recorded in two macaque monkeys performing visually guided saccades while holding their hand at given locations on a touchscreen. To determine the relative contributions of hand vision and its proprioception, monkeys executed the task with or without vision of the hand.","background":"Recent neurophysiological studies have begun to uncover the neuronal correlates of eye hand coordination. This study was designed to test whether the frontal eye field (FEF) saccadic activity is modulated by hand position.","conclusion":"We found that saccadic activity of more than half of the neuronal sample (54%; n=130) was dependent on hand position relative to the saccade end point. Both visual and proprioceptive signals contributed to this modulation.

In addition, we also examined the sex difference of the NTS effect. Measurements of body weights, an open-field locomotor test, an elevated plus maze test, a hot-plate test, and a contextual fear-conditioning test were performed on postnatal day 60.","background":"It is well known that early life events induce long-lasting psychophysiological and psychobiological influences in later life. In rodent studies, environmental enrichment after weaning prevents the adulthood behavioral and emotional disturbances in response to early adversities.","conclusion":"As compared with rats subjected to NI, rats subjected to NTS showed significantly higher activity and exploration in the open-field locomotor test, lower anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze test, and significantly prolonged latencies in the hot-plate test, and this effect was equal among males and females. In the contextual fear-conditioning test, whereas NTS significantly reduced the enhanced freezing time due to NI in females, no significant difference in the freezing time between NI and NTS was found in males. These findings indicate that adequate tactile stimulation in early life plays an important role in the prevention of disturbances in the behavioral and emotional responses to environmental stimuli in adulthood induced by early adverse experiences."},{"method":"In this study, we proposed to use neural stem cell transplantation as a novel therapy to treat TS and discussed its efficacy. Wistar rats were microinfused with TS sera into the striatum followed by the transplantation of NSCs or vehicle at the infusion site. The sera of the TS patients were identified to have enriched antineural antibodies. Prior to grafting, rat embryonic NSCs were co-cultured with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (Brdu) for 24 h. Stereotypic behaviors were counted at 1, 7, 14 and 21 days after transplantation of NSCs. Morphological analyses revealed that NSCs survived and differentiated into neurons and astrocytes in the striatum 3 weeks after grafting.","background":"Tourette syndrome (TS) is a heterogenous neuropsychiatric disorder. In most cases, tics are self-limited or can be treated by behavioral or pharmacological therapy. However, for some individuals, tics can cause lifelong impairment and life-threatening symptoms, which are intractable to traditional treatment. Neural stem cell (NSC) is a potential tool to treat certain neurological diseases.","conclusion":"To sum it up, rat embryonic neural stem cell grafts survived and differentiated in the striatum of TS rat may help relieve stereotypic behaviors of the host. Our results suggest that transplantation of NSCs intrastriatum may have therapeutic potential for TS."},{"method":"In this report, the effectiveness of an extinction training protocol to reduce primed reinstatement responses was compared with the effectiveness of an equivalent period of enforced abstinence.","background":"Although the process of extinction has been well documented for various forms of behavioral responses, the effects of extinction on the reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior are relatively understudied.","conclusion":"We found that extinction training performed in the drug taking environment significantly reduced reinstatement behavior subsequently primed by either contextual cues, conditioned cues, or cocaine infusion. The ability of extinction to reduce cocaine primed reinstatement was blocked by the systemic administration of the competitive NMDAR antagonist ((+\/-)CPP, 5mg\/kg i.p.) administered prior to each extinction training session. Interestingly, this pharmacological intervention had no impact on the effectiveness of extinction to reduce drug-seeking behavior primed by either contextual cues or conditioned cues. These results suggest that an extinction training experience involves multiple mechanisms that can be dissociated into nonNMDAR and NMDAR dependent components with respect to the type of reinstatement (i.e. context-, conditioned stimuli (CS)-, or drug-induced) being assessed."},{"method":"In the study presented, we compared the effects of the neuroleptics, haloperidol, and risperidone and the PDE10A inhibitor papaverine as well as the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram on retrieval of conditioned avoidance responding in the pole-jumping task and on locomotor activity. After acute administration, the substances used reduced locomotor activity dose-dependently.","background":"It was suggested that phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors may be potential neuroleptic drugs with a low risk of extrapyramidal symptoms.","conclusion":"Both PDE inhibitors interfered with conditioned avoidance responding, suggesting neuroleptic-like effects. Risperidone showed a favourable profile of action. In all the doses tested, no signs of unspecific impairments in the performance of the instrumental task occurred. The profile of rolipram was similar. In the doses tested, only minor impairments in the performance of the instrumental task were found. Rolipram showed a similar effect to risperidone, suggesting therapeutic usefulness as an atypical neuroleptic.

These tests included the acquisition of a passive avoidance response as a measure of long-term memory of an aversive experience, and spontaneous alternation in a Y-maze, regarded as a measure of spatial short-term memory. The absence of APP expression in APP KO mice was confirmed at the protein level using hippocampal tissue in Western blotting.","background":"Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its role in cognition has been relatively little studied. APP knockout (KO) animals have been described previously and show deficits in grip strength, reduced locomotor activity and impaired learning and memory in a conditioned avoidance test and the Morris water-maze.","conclusion":"APP KO mice displayed deficits in forelimb grip strength and locomotor activity in agreement with previous studies. In the Y-maze test used for spontaneous alternation behaviour, APP KO animals did not exhibit reduced alternation rates. On the other hand, in the passive avoidance test, APP KO mice showed an age-related deficit in retention of memory for an aversive experience. The results suggest that APP and\/or its proteolytic derivatives may play a role in long-term memory in adult brain and\/or may be required during the development and maintenance of neuronal networks involved in this type of memory."},{"method":"The first study explored the hypothesis that MTX reduces neuronal cell proliferation. A dose-dependent long-lasting decrease in hippocampal cell proliferation was shown with Ki-67 immunocytochemistry, following a single intravenous injection of MTX (37.5-300 mg\/kg). Animals treated with MTX also showed a dose-dependent transient decrease in body weight gain. In the second study, the effect of MTX (250 mg\/kg) on two spatial learning tasks was examined. Animals treated with MTX learned the Morris water maze task adequately; however, these animals showed a longer latency time to cross the platform location in the probe trial, reflecting an impairment of spatial memory function. In the novel object recognition task, animals treated with MTX failed to distinguish a novel object from a familiar one, indicating a decrease in the comparator function of the hippocampus.","background":"Methotrexate (MTX) is a cytostatic agent widely used in combination with other agents as adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and is associated with cognitive impairment as a long-term side effect in some cancer patients. This paper aimed to identify a neurobiological mechanism possibly responsible for this cognitive impairment using an animal model.","conclusion":"Our studies indicated that, in the rat, MTX has a dose-dependent negative effect on hippocampal cell proliferation, and on cognitive behavior.

This deficiency results in the accumulation of various oligosaccharides in the lysosomes of affected individuals, causing somatic pathology and progressive neurological degeneration that results in cognitive deficits, ataxia, and other neurological symptoms.","conclusion":"General neurological examinations showed progressive differences in alpha-mannosidosis animals from approximately 1 month of age. Significant differences were observed in hind limb gait width from 2 months of age and significant cognitive (memory and learning) deficits were observed from 3 months of age. Evoked response tests showed an increase in somatosensory P1 peak latency in alpha-mannosidosis guinea pigs from approximately 2 months of age, as well as progressive hearing loss using auditory brainstem evoked responses. The alpha-mannosidosis guinea pig therefore appears to exhibit many of the characteristics of the human disease, and will be useful in evaluating therapies for treatment of central nervous system pathology."},{"method":"Here we analyzed the relationship between social behavior and innate anxiety in C57BL\/6 and BALB\/c mice using a mating-related interaction (MRI) test in which a resident male was observed during exposure to a sexually receptive female. Unlike male-male encounters where social interaction is brief and tentative and aggressive behaviors are prominent, male-female encounters are characterized by a strong motivation for extensive social interaction with the potential for modulation by innate anxiety. We hypothesized that differences in innate avoidance behavior between mouse-inbred strains would contribute to mating-related social interaction strategies.","background":"Anxiety is an important modulator of social behavior across species and parallel defects in anxiety and social interaction are frequently observed in mental illnesses such as autism and schizophrenia. The mouse is a powerful model organism to study the molecular genetic basis of these behaviors.","conclusion":"Our observations showed that C57BL\/6 and BALB\/c males exhibited distinct approach strategies in the mating-related interaction test that correlated with specific features of anxiety as observed in the open field.

Four MPTP cynomolgus monkeys received l-dopa (LD; 100mg) with benserazide (25 mg) for one month. Progressively, all these animals developed LID. Four other MPTP monkeys received Ro 61-8048 (50mg\/kg) daily 3 h before administration of LD\/benserazide for one month.","background":"Increased glutamatergic activity is believed to play a significant role in the development of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID). LID may therefore be attenuated by a reduction in glutamatergic function.","conclusion":"The addition of Ro 61-8048 reduced the development of LID but did not affect the antiparkinsonian efficacy of LD. Moreover, Ro 61-8048 administration caused sustained increases in serum kynurenine and KYNA concentrations, which reverted to basal values 24 h after the last treatment. This effect of Ro 61-8048 was less pronounced in the CSF. These results demonstrate that long-lasting elevation of KYNA levels caused by prolonged inhibition of kynurenine 3-hydroxylase is associated with a significant reduction in LID but does not compromise the benefits of chronic LD therapy."},{"method":"Consequently, we presently studied the effects of similarly administered EPO in fimbria-fornix transected and control operated rats, respectively--evaluating the posttraumatic behavioural\/cognitive abilities in a spatial delayed alternation task performed in a T-maze.","background":"Systemically administered human recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) may have the potential to reduce the cognitive and behavioural symptoms of a mechanical brain injury. In a series of studies we address this possibility. We have previously found that EPO given to fimbria-fornix transected rats at the moment of injury is able substantially to improve the posttraumatic acquisition of allocentric place learning tasks administered in a water maze as well as in an 8-arm radial maze. It is, however, essential to evaluate this clinically important ability of EPO within other cognitive domains, as well.","conclusion":"Administration of EPO to the hippocampally injured rats was associated with a substantial reduction of the lesion-associated behavioural impairment--while such an impairment was clearly seen in the saline injected fimbria-fornix transected group. In contrast, EPO had no detectable effect on the task acquisition of non-lesioned animals. The results of the present study confirm our previous demonstrations that EPO is able to reduce or eliminate the behavioural\/cognitive consequences of mechanical injury to the hippocampus--and emphasize that this ability is present across a broader spectrum of cognitive domains."},{"method":"We tested whether AMP promotes recovery after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in rats. A moderate-sized ICH was produced by stereotaxically injecting collagenase into the striatum. Five days later rats were placed into either environmental enrichment cages (EE) or a control condition (group housing in standard cages) until euthanasia at 4 weeks post-ICH. Animals were injected with either AMP (2 mg\/kg i.p.) or sterile saline on days 7, 9 and 11 after ICH. Rats in EE also received training on beam (walking) and tray (skilled reaching) tasks 30 min after each injection. Walking (beam and ladder task), skilled reaching (tray and staircase tasks) and neurological deficits (NDS) were repeatedly assessed. We predicted that EE would improve recovery and that AMP would further enhance it.","background":"D-amphetamine (AMP) paired with physical activity (e.g., beam walking) improves recovery after ischemic injury to the cortical motor system of rodents.","conclusion":"Results showed that EE, but not AMP, significantly and consistently improved recovery on the beam and ladder task. Neither treatment significantly affected skilled reaching. Lesion volume was not significantly different among groups (overall average: 44.6 mm(3) of tissue lost +\/-15.3 S.D.). In conclusion, EE provides modest benefit for striatal ICH whereas AMP does not. This suggests that AMP will not provide substantial benefit to those patients with severe ICH affecting the basal ganglia."},{"method":"Pregnant C57BL\/6J mice were fed either a control (35 microg Zn\/g) or Zn-supplemented (200 microg Zn\/g) diet throughout pregnancy.

Furthermore, these mice also exhibited impairments in object recognition memory. In comparison, ethanol-exposed offspring from dams fed a Zn-supplemented diet throughout pregnancy did not display spatial memory or object recognition deficits, performing at the same level as saline-treated offspring.

This phase of nausea has been interpreted as a classically conditioned response where a conditional association develops between the contextual clinic cues and the nausea and\/or vomiting that developed following treatment. Although rats do not vomit, they display a distinctive gaping reaction when exposed a flavored solution previously paired with a toxin.","conclusion":"These results suggest that the conditioned gaping reaction in rats is selectively elicited by nausea-paired contextual stimuli, as well as flavors. This rat model of anticipatory nausea may serve as a valuable preclinical tool to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-nausea treatments and the side effect of nausea produced by newly developed pharmaceutical compounds intended for other clinical treatments."},{"method":"Young adult male rats were housed in EE for 1 week prior to and throughout 3 weeks of daily restraint stress. On the day after the end of restraint, rats were trained and tested on either a water maze (19 degrees C or 24 degrees C water temperature) or a spatial recognition Y-maze (4-h and 1-min delay between training and testing).","background":"Chronic stress impairs spatial memory and alters hippocampal structure, which are changed in the opposite direction following enriched environment (EE). Therefore, this study incorporated these two paradigms to determine whether EE would prevent chronic stress from impairing spatial learning and memory.","conclusion":"Chronically stressed rats housed in standard conditions showed impaired acquisition on the 19 degrees C version of the water maze and deficits on the 4-h delay version of the Y-maze. Chronically stressed rats housed in EE, however, showed intact performance on all tasks. All rats showed intact performance on the 24 degrees C version of the water maze and on water maze probe trials for both versions. The results showed that EE in adulthood prevented spatial learning and memory impairment in chronically stressed rats, indicating that the context of stress exposure impacts susceptibility to chronic stress-induced cognitive deficits."},{"method":"We observed a contrasting relationship between floating and water temperature between the two strains, with C57BL\/6J floating more and BALB\/c floating less with increasing water temperature, independent of the lightening conditions and the time point of testing during the animals' circadian rhythm. Both strains showed an inverse relationship between plasma corticosterone concentration and water temperature, indicating that the differences in stress coping are unrelated to different perception of the aversive encounter. Treatment with desipramine (20mg\/kg, i.p.) caused a reduction in immobility time in C57BL\/6J mice if the animals were tested at 30 degrees C water temperature, with no effect at 25 degrees C and no effects on forced swim stress-induced corticosterone secretion. The same treatment failed to affect floating behaviour in BALB\/c at any temperature, but caused a decrease in plasma corticosterone levels.","background":"To investigate genotype x environment interactions in the forced swim test, we tested the influence of water temperature (20 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 30 degrees C) on floating behaviour in single-housed male C57BL\/6J and BALB\/c mice.","conclusion":"Taken together we demonstrate that an increase in water temperature in the forced swim test exerts opposite effects on floating behaviour in C57BL\/6J and BALB\/c and renders single-housed C57BL\/6J mice, but not BALB\/c mice, susceptible to antidepressant-like behavioral effects of desipramine."},{"method":"Experiment 1 assessed the effects of intra-PAG infusions of the 5-HT2B\/2C receptor agonist mCPP (0, 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 nmol\/0.1 microl) on the behaviour of mice exposed to the elevated plus-maze. As mCPP acts preferentially at 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors, Experiment 2 investigated its effects in animals pretreated with ketanserin, a preferential 5-HT2A\/2C receptor antagonist. In both cases, test sessions were videotaped and subsequently, scored for anxiety-like behaviour (e.g., percentage of open arm entries and percentage of open arm time) as well as general locomotor activity (closed arm entries).","background":"It is widely acknowledged that the indoleamine neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) plays a dual role in the regulation of anxiety, a role that in part depends upon neuroanatomical locus of action. Thus, whereas stimulation of 5-HT 1A or 5-HT2 receptors in the limbic forebrain (amygdala, hippocampus) enhances anxiety-like responding in rodents, activation of corresponding receptor populations in the midbrain periaqueductal grey (PAG) more often than not reduce anxiety-like behaviour. The present study specifically concerns the anxiety-modulating influence of 5-HT2 receptors within the mouse PAG.","conclusion":"The results of Experiment 1 showed that mCPP microinfusions (0.03 and 0.1 nmol) into the PAG of mice decreased behavioural indices of anxiety without significantly altering general activity measures. In Experiment 2, the anxiolytic-like profile of intra-PAG mCPP (0.03 nmol) was substantially attenuated by intra-PAG pretreatment with an intrinsically inactive dose of the preferential 5-HT2A\/2C receptor antagonist, ketanserin (10 nmol\/0.1mul). Together, these data suggest that 5HT2C receptor populations within the midbrain PAG play an inhibitory role in plus-maze anxiety in mice."},{"method":"To examine if 3alpha,5alpha-THP in the VTA mediates socio-sexual behaviors, we infused 3alpha,5alpha-THP to the VTA of diestrous and proestrous rats. As expected, proestrous, compared to diestrous, rats showed more exploratory (open field), anxiolytic (elevated plus maze), pro-social (partner preference, social interaction), and sexual (paced mating) behavior and had increased E2, P4, dihydroprogesterone (DHP), and 3alpha,5alpha-THP in serum, midbrain, hippocampus, diencephalon, and cortex. Infusions of 3alpha,5alpha-THP to the VTA, but not control sites, such as the substantia nigra (SN) or central grey (CG), of diestrous rats produced behavioral and endocrine effects akin to that of proestrous rats and increased DHP and 3alpha,5alpha-THP levels in midbrain, hippocampus, and diencephalon.","background":"17beta-Estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) influence the onset and duration of sexual behavior and are also associated with changes in behaviors that may contribute to mating, such as exploration, anxiety, and social behaviors (socio-sexual behaviors). In the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA), the P4 metabolite, 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP), modulates lordosis of E2-primed rodents; 3alpha,5alpha-THP can also influence anxiety and social behaviors.","conclusion":"Levels of DHP and 3alpha,5alpha-THP, but neither E2 nor P4 concentrations, in midbrain, hippocampus, diencephalon, and\/or cortex were positively correlated with socio-sexual behaviors. Thus, 3alpha,5alpha-THP infusions to the VTA, but not SN or CG, can enhance socio-sexual behaviors and increase levels in midbrain, hippocampus, and diencephalon."},{"method":"The analysis implicated that, in contrast to the controversial and previously reported hypo-activity in ak mice, Pitx3-\/- mice showed normal dark phase motor activity levels.","background":"Deficiency of the meso-diencephalic dopamine (mdDA) neuron specific transcription factor Pitx3 in aphakia (ak) mice results in the loss of the substantia nigra compacta (SNc). Concomitantly, reduced spontaneous locomotor behavior, symptoms reminiscent to those in Parkinson's disease, has been reported. However, the ak mouse line originates from the 1960s and has been compared to C57BL\/6J inbred controls. Therefore, to define Pitx3 gene function in baseline and novelty-induced locomotor behavior and mdDA neuronal activity, we analyzed Pitx3-deficiency in a controlled genetic and epigenetic background.","conclusion":"Our data also revealed that ak and Pitx3-\/- mice both display a similar neuro-anatomical and physiological phenotype, and, interestingly, showed increased spontaneous home cage activity levels during their habitual sleep phase. Further behavioral analysis revealed that both ak and Pitx3-\/- mice have reduced transitions but increased consolidation of specific locomotor behaviors, such as rearing and horizontal movement. Thus, Pitx3 is not involved in the expression of nighttime motor activity levels, but is critical for selective mdDA neuronal activity and associated with increased consolidation of movement."},{"method":"nNOS gene deletion and 3-Bromo-7-Nitroindazole were used to inhibit the production of neuronal NO.","background":"Many psychological disorders are characterized by anxiety and alterations in social interactions. Recent studies demonstrate that the chemical messenger nitric oxide (NO) can regulate both anxiety and social behaviours. We tested whether an enzyme that produces NO in the brain, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), serves as an interface between social interactions and anxiety-like behaviour. Several investigators have observed that mice increase anxiety-like responses in the elevated plus-maze after pair housing.","conclusion":"Similar to previous studies, pair housing reduced open arm exploration in the elevated plus-maze. Pair housing also increased corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) immunoreactive cells in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Inhibition of NO production increased open arm exploration in pair-housed mice but decreased open arm exploration in individually housed mice. These results suggest that the effect of nNOS inhibition on anxiety-like responses is context dependent and that behavioural responses to social housing are altered after nNOS inhibition. This research suggests that NO may play an important role in mediating the effect social interactions have on anxiety."},{"method":"Here we report a novel instrumental learning task designed to determine whether regions implicated in processing reversal errors are uniquely involved in this process, or whether they play a more general role in representing response competition, reinforcement value, or punishment value in the absence of demands for response change.","background":"Studies investigating response reversal consistently implicate regions of medial and lateral prefrontal cortex when reinforcement contingencies change. However, it is unclear from these studies how these regions give rise to the individual components of response reversal, such as reinforcement value encoding, response inhibition, and response change.","conclusion":"In line with previous findings, reversal errors activated orbitofrontal cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, caudate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These regions also showed increased activity to errors in the absence of contingency changes. In addition, ventrolateral PFC, caudate, and dorsolateral PFC each exhibited increased activity following correct reversals. Activity in these regions was not significantly modulated by changes in reinforcement value that were not sufficient to make an alternative response advantageous. These data do not support punishment-processing or prepotent response inhibition accounts of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex function. Instead, they support recent conceptualizations of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex function that implicate this region in resolving response competition by manipulating the representation of either motor response options, or object features. These data also suggest that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex plays a role in reversal learning, probably through top down attentional control of object or reinforcement features when task demands increase."},{"method":"This study compared the effects of lesions of the basal forebrain made with either the immunotoxin 192-IgG-saporin (which selectively destroys cholinergic neurons), or the non-selective excitotoxin, ibotenic acid (which destroys both cholinergic and non-cholinergic neurons) on a task which measure the acquisition and shifting of attentional set as well as the ability to learn reversals of specific stimulus-reward pairings. Rats learned to obtain food reward by digging in small bowls containing distinctive digging media that were differentially scented with distinct odours. They performed a series of two-choice discriminations, with the bait associated with either the odour or the digging medium.","background":"The cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, which project to cortex, the thalamic reticular nucleus and the amygdala, are implicated in many aspects of attentional function, while the intrinsic neurons of the basal forebrain are implicated in learning and memory.","conclusion":"Rats with 192-IgG-saporin lesions of the basal forebrain were not impaired relative to control rats at any stage of the task. Rats with ibotenic acid lesions of the basal forebrain were impaired the first time stimulus-reward contingencies were reversed. They were not impaired in acquisition of new discriminations, even when an attentional-shift was required. These data are consistent with data from marmosets and so highlight the functional similarity of monkey and rodent basal forebrain. They also confirm the likely involvement of non-cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain in reversal learning."},{"method":"Here we show in 6-month-old male CD1 mice (deprived 24h at postnatal day 8) an initial impairment in reversal learning: relocating the platform revealed perseverance in search for the former location.","background":"Rat pups subjected to a single 24h maternal deprivation show altered stress responsiveness and cognitive performance in the water maze in adulthood.","conclusion":"Spatial learning, long-term memory and swim-induced corticosterone responses were not affected. We conclude that reduced flexibility is a subtle long-lasting behavioural change induced by maternal deprivation."},{"method":"Using ERPs, the present study aimed to determine whether predictable and unpredictable outcomes are coded differently in the brain. Participants had to choose between one of two options: the certain option was always associated with a gain of 10 euro, while the uncertain option entailed a gain of 30 euro or a loss of 10 euro, with a probability of 50% each.","background":"When making decisions, the outcomes of different choices play an important role. Feedback is mainly processed in terms of gains and losses. It is as yet unclear whether this distinction holds for predictable as well as unpredictable outcomes.","conclusion":"Overall, subjects showed a clear preference for the certain option, a tendency which became more pronounced during the course of the experiment. An early ERP component, the P200, reflected the predictability of outcomes, which was critical for the subsequent decisions. The later feedback related negativity (FRN) reflected the known distinction between gains and losses, while the N500 again reflected differential processing of predictable and unpredictable outcomes. Neither FRN nor the N500 were significantly related to behaviour. Predictability appears to play a central role in outcome evaluation."},{"method":"Adult males were given subcutaneous silastic implants of androgen, in case drug treatment interfered with androgen secretion. One week later, they were tested with females. Males were divided into three groups matched for levels of courtship singing. Males were then subcutaneously implanted with osmotic minipumps containing either saline, a low, or a high dose of cis-flupenthixol. Each male was tested with a different female 5 and 10 days after implantation to determine how this D1\/D2 receptor antagonist affected behavior.","background":"We previously demonstrated that hormone treatments which stimulate female-directed singing increased levels and turnover of dopamine (DA) in brain areas controlling the motor patterning of song. To help determine how DA affects singing, we quantified the effects of treating adult male finches with the D1\/D2 receptor antagonist cis-flupenthixol.","conclusion":"Both drug doses affected female-directed singing 5 days after initiation of treatment. High-dose males sang to females significantly less often than males in the other two groups. Low-dose males showed fewer high-intensity courtship displays in which males dance towards females as they sing. These effects on courtship singing were not seen at day 10, though other behavioral effects were seen at this time. Male beak wipes, rocks, following females and female withdrawals from males were also affected by drug treatment. General activity in the home cage was decreased by day 11. These data demonstrate that singing and several other female-directed behaviors are sensitive to perturbations in DA receptor function."},{"method":"In the present study, we investigated the effect of creatine on early consolidation of the spatial learning in rats. Statistical analysis showed that intrahippocampal administration of creatine (2.5 and 7.5 nmol\/hippocampus) (post-training) decreased the latency for scape and mean number of errors in Barnes maze test. The involvement of polyamine binding site at NMDA receptor in creatine-induced spatial learning enhancement was investigated by co-administration of arcaine (0.02 nmol\/hippocampus) or spermidine (0.02 nmol\/hippocampus) with creatine (2.5 nmol\/hippocampus) (post-training).","background":"Achievements made over the last years have highlighted the important role of creatine in health and disease. However, studies of its effect on cognition function have been limited.","conclusion":"Statistical analysis revealed that creatine-induced spatial learning enhancement was reverted by co-administration of arcaine (0.02 nmol\/hippocampus) and intensified by spermidine (0.02 nmol\/hippocampus). These results provide evidence that creatine not only seem to be involved in energy metabolism but may also play an important role in early consolidation of spatial learning in hippocampus which participation of polyamines binding site at the NMDA receptor."},{"method":"When tested as adolescents, SS decreased anxiety-like behaviour in females and had no effect in males. When tested as adults several weeks after the chronic stress, overall, SS tended to increase anxiety-like behaviour in both sexes. However, estrous cycle moderated the effect in females, in that reduced anxiety-like behaviour was observed for SS females in the estrous group. Confinement to the open arm of the EPM increased plasma corticosterone concentrations, which declined markedly upon return to home cage for all except adolescent control males for which corticosterone concentrations at 45 and 90 min were elevated compared other groups.","background":"Using a rat model of adolescent social stress (SS, daily 1 h isolation and change of cage partner, 30-45 days of age), we have reported sex-specific effects on neuroendocrine function over the course of SS, and enduring effects of SS in females, and not males, on drug-related behaviour. Here, we investigated both the immediate and enduring impact of SS in adolescence on anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and determined the temporal pattern of corticosterone release after confinement to the open arm of the EPM.","conclusion":"Among controls, anxiety-like behaviour decreased in females and increased in males with age, and confinement to the open arm of the EPM led to a greater increase in corticosterone concentrations in adult males compared to adolescent males. In sum, modest effects of adolescent social stress were observable several weeks after the stress exposure, indicating that sex-specific developmental trajectories and vulnerability to anxiety may be shaped by experiences in adolescence."},{"method":"In the present experiment, we studied how previous exposure to a severe stressor (2 h of immobilisation, IMO, 5 days before testing) and repeated exposure to the same novel environment (a holeboard, HB) altered behavioral and HPA response to the HB.","background":"Activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is presumably related to the degree of novelty and considered to reflect emotional reactivity. Exposure to novel environments can allow us to simultaneously evaluate both behavior and HPA activation and therefore it is an appropriate design to directly study the relationship between both responses.","conclusion":"Previous exposure to IMO did not alter any behavior during the first exposure to the HB (5 min), but elicited a greater ACTH response as compared to stress-naive rats. However, corticosterone response did not differ between groups, probably because maximum corticosterone levels are never reached before 15-20 min. Repeated exposure of IMO and stress-naive rats to the HB every other day resulted in progressively lower levels of activity\/exploration in both groups, whereas the ACTH and corticosterone responses were basically maintained intact over the days. The present results demonstrate a double dissociation between behavior and HPA activation in the HB. First, a single exposure to IMO elicited a long-lasting sensitisation of the HPA axis that apparently was not a direct consequence of fear\/anxiety elicited by the novel environment. Second, progressive familiarisation of the animals with a novel environment resulting in apparently lower levels of motivation to explore did not appear to reduce the stressful properties of the situation as evaluated by ACTH release."},{"method":"For this purpose, in the first experiment, rats were intraperitoneally (i.p.) pretreated with saline or DZP (1mg\/kg) and 25min later they were intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) injected with PBS or SP (10 pmol). In the second experiment, rats were i.p. pretreated with saline or DZP (1mg\/kg) and 25 min later were i.c.v. injected with FK888 (100 pmol, a NK1 antagonist).

Although the central administration of SP did not significantly alter 'per se' the latency to leave the enclosed arm of the ETM in the test and re-test sessions, there was a trend to increase this parameter in the test session (indicating an anxiogenic-like effect). Furthermore, SP was able to reverse, via NK1 receptors, the effect produced by DZP during the test session. Moreover, none of the treatments interfered in the one-way escape behavior recorded in the test or re-test session in the ETM. In conclusion, our results strengthen and extend previous experimental data showing an interaction between the tachykinergic and benzodiazepine-GABA systems in the modulation of anxiety."},{"method":"To answer this question, we raised male zebra finches to adulthood in a controlled environment, and were then exposed them to either a single unfamiliar female (simple social environment) or to 45 unfamiliar zebra finches of both sexes (complex social environment). Their singing behavior was monitored in these new social environments.","background":"Previous studies found that complex social environment increases new neuronal recruitment in brains of adult male zebra finches, in comparison with exposure to a simple social environment. These experiments could not determine, however, whether this increase was due to greater amounts of auditory input (amount of auditory information the male is exposed to), or auditory output (amount of song it produces).","conclusion":"Birds which were exposed to a simple social environment sang significantly more than birds which were exposed to a complex social environment. This supports the hypothesis that increased neuronal recruitment in birds exposed to a complex social environment correlates with processing and storing of auditory input, and not with song produced by the bird."},{"method":"In the present study we administered SD or control stress to male CD1 mice following a dose-response protocol based on time of exposure to the experimental conditions (6, 12 or 24 h) and repetition of treatment (three times).","background":"Sensitization to the effect of stress has been hypothesized as a mechanism to explain episode recurrence and cycle acceleration in bipolar disorder. Naturalistic observations and experimental work in human patients suggested that sleep deprivation can trigger manic episodes of illness. In rats sleep deprivation (SD) with the platform method caused mania-like behaviours thus providing an animal model of mania with face, construct, and predictive validity.","conclusion":"SD, but not stress-control conditions, increased motor activity and aggressive behaviours. The behavioural activation followed a dose-response curve based on length of treatment, with non-significant trends after 6h, significant effects after 12 h, and maximal effects after 24 h. Moreover, the behavioural activation followed a time-response curve, with progressive sensitization to the effects of SD, but not of control stress, upon its repetition. This is the first animal model of behavioural sensitization to the effects of a specific stress (sleep deprivation) known to trigger mania in bipolar patients. We expect it to be useful to test the efficacy of antimanic and mood-stabilizer drugs, and to study the neurobiological correlates of manic reactions in order to gain new insight into the pathophysiology of bipolar illness and to identify new targets for treatment."},{"method":"Here, we explored Ts65Dn explicit memory deficits further by evaluating the ability of these mice to assimilate the temporal and spatial contexts under which previously novel objects had been encountered.","background":"Ts65Dn mice, like individuals with Down syndrome (DS), demonstrate a functional dissociation between explicit and implicit forms of memory, showing selective impairment in explicit or declarative learning tasks.","conclusion":"We found that Ts65Dn mice could in fact form contextual representations of objects over the course of a few hours, contrary to their inability to discriminate object novelty over a more prolonged period of 24h. These results suggest that Ts65Dn mice might have particular difficulties in declarative tasks requiring long-term memory, presenting an especially important putative therapeutic target for pre-clinical and clinical DS research."},{"method":"Sixteen patients with early HD and 16 age-matched controls were examined in aiming movements. Four conditions manipulated movement termination requirements (discrete movements with a complete stop vs. cyclical back-and-forth movements) and the presence of flankers around the target.","background":"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting the striatum and associated with deficits in voluntary movement in early stages. The final portion of aiming movements is particularly affected in HD and one hypothesis is that this deficit is linked to attention or terminal control requirements.","conclusion":"Reducing movement termination requirements significantly attenuated deficits in the final movement phase in patients. The presence of flankers around the target affected the initial portion of movements but did not affect the two groups differentially. These results indicate that terminal control requirements affect voluntary movements in HD.

A number of studies have indicated that anti-Nogo-A antibodies can be used to enhance plasticity and behavioral recovery following damage to motor cortex, and spinal cord.","conclusion":"Each of the three antibodies induced dramatic significant behavioral recovery from neglect relative to controls.

It has been shown; orexin-containing terminals and orexin receptors densely are distributed in the hippocampal formation. We have previously demonstrated that antagonization of orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) in CA1 region of hippocampus and dentate gyrus (DG) impaired spatial memory processing. Although, there are few studies concerning function of orexinergic system on memory processing in PA task, but there is no study about physiological function of OX1R on this process.","conclusion":"Our results show that, SB-334867-A administration into CA1 region impaired memory retrieval but not PA acquisition and consolidation.

Dopamine utilization was similar in the three sub-populations, but serotonin utilization was lower in the prefrontal cortex of the Medium and Very high BLI sub-populations as compared to the low BLI one. These results suggest that anti-impulsive effects of caffeine and d-amphetamine are dependent on the BLI of rats and that a low serotonergic function in the prefrontal cortex may be a trait marker of impulsivity evaluated by impulsive choice behavior."},{"method":"In this study we sought to compare the effects of enriched and standard housing on temperature perception. In an operant assay, rats housed in an enriched environment exhibited significantly lower sensitivities to thermal stimuli and displayed less exploratory behavior in a rearing chamber.","background":"Environmental enrichment reduces reactivity to stressor and could also modulate pain perception.","conclusion":"These findings indicate that environmental enrichment can significantly affect temperature perception, likely through stress-related mechanisms."},{"method":"The purpose of the present study was, for one, to compare the effects of a pharmacological and genetic manipulation of CB(1) cannabinoid receptors on amphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization in mice, and, secondly, to quantify the concentration of anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol in different forebrain areas of behaviourally sensitized animals.","background":"Cannabinoid receptors and their endogenous ligands (endocannabinoids) have been implicated in cocaine and amphetamine reward. Their role in psychostimulant-induced behavioural sensitization still has to be determined.","conclusion":"The results can be summarized as follows: CB(1) knockout mice failed to sensitize to the locomotor stimulant effects of amphetamine. On the contrary, administration of the CB(1) receptor antagonist SR141716A (rimonabant; 3mg\/kg; i.p.) increased amphetamine sensitization in wild-type animals, indicating that the difference between CB(1) knockouts and SR141716A treated animals could be due to the 'chronic' versus 'acute' loss of CB(1) receptor function, or, alternatively, that SR141716A could exert pharmacological effects beyond its proposed CB(1) antagonistic action. Furthermore, sensitized wild-type mice and animals, which had received a single amphetamine injection on the challenge day, both had increased anandamide concentrations in the dorsal striatum and decreased anandamide levels in the ventral striatum, comprising nucleus accumbens. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol levels were decreased in the ventral striatum of sensitized animals only.

Based on a median split, subjects were divided into a rather symmetric and a rather asymmetric group. Then, all participants completed both tasks simultaneously.","background":"Functional cerebral asymmetries (FCAs) are a fundamental principle of brain organization in many species. However, little is known about why they have evolved. Since FCAs are such a widespread phenomenon they seem to constitute an evolutionary selective advantage. According to a prominent hypothesis, an asymmetric brain should be associated with advantages in parallel processing, i.e. doing two tasks simultaneously. The strong version of this hypothesis implies that lateralized, instantaneous and complementary tasks are performed more efficiently with a highly lateralized brain.","conclusion":"The results revealed that the rather symmetrically organized participants outperformed asymmetric participants in accuracy and response times.

Animals are introduced to the maze without preliminary habituation and trained in a working memory test.","background":"Fifty percent of CD-1 mice from both sex die by the end of 2 years. The survival rate is higher in females than in males. This high mortality rate is associated to the high susceptibility of this strain of mice to some immuno-pathologies and the high incidence of systemic amyloidosis. It is therefore possible that premature cognitive deficits can be observed in CD-1 mice.","conclusion":"As expected CD-1 mice have a low number of entries to arms on their first exposure to the maze which confirm our previous report on the anxious trait of this strain compared to C57\/BL6 mice. The measure of arm\/bridge ratio suggests that anxiety induced by exposure to the maze persists much longer in middle-aged male mice compared to middle-aged female mice and compared to both young male and female mice. The measure of memory revealed that young female mice made significantly less arm repeats and more unique arm visits before first arm repeat than middle-aged female and male mice. There are also significant differences between young female and young male mice with the former committing fewer errors than the latter."},{"method":"In two successive experiments, we trained animals to discriminate black and white grating patterns with two moving directions: upward or downward, or standing still.

The possible neuronal substrate for the movement aftereffect is discussed."},{"method":"Rats were introduced into either a round or a square arena with various arrays of freestanding portable corners (objects) that differed in spacing, orientation, and number.","background":"The present study examines how rats process object information in relation to other objects as well as to the global shape of an enclosure.","conclusion":"We found that the time spent at the objects was substantially higher in the round compared with the square arena. Rats in the square arena distributed their time evenly between arena perimeter and objects; however, they visited the objects more frequently than the perimeter. Rats tested in either round or square arena favored staying at the interior of the object regardless of its orientation in the arena. Finally, only geometric changes in the object array affected the rats' level of activity. These findings demonstrate that the rats were able to detect the geometry of the enclosure, the array, and the objects. We suggest that the context of the global enclosure geometry affects the meaning of landmarks (objects) for the observer, which in turn results in a different distribution of activity. Specifically, an object's local geometry served mainly in the context of a safe place in the round arena, as manifested in extended duration of stay at the objects, however in the square arena served mainly as a place of interest, as manifested in the frequent visits, but without their staying there. Thus, the geometries of the enclosure, the object array, and the discrete objects, together shape exploratory behavior in rats."},{"method":"In this present study, a new approach to quantifying motor imagery of goal-directed hand movements by means of eye movement registration is examined. Eye movements of 15 right-handed subjects were recorded using EOG during both physical execution and visual motor imagery of a cyclical aiming task, performed at three different inter-target distances.","background":"It has been suggested that motor imagery possesses a range of useful applications in sport as well as in rehabilitation. Until now, research in this field has been hampered by the lack of an objective method to monitor the subjects' participation in the task.","conclusion":"We found that 89% of subjects made task-related eye movements during imagery with the eyes open and 84% of participants also did so during imagery with the eyes closed. Both the number and amplitude of the eye movements during imagery closely resembled those of eye movements made during physical execution of the task. This indicates that the coupling between neural patterns for eye and hand movements remains intact when hand movements are merely imagined as opposed to being physically executed. Therefore, eye movement recordings may be used as an objective technique to evaluate subjects' compliance, motor imagery ability, and spatial accuracy."},{"method":"In the present study, environmental prenatal stress (EPS) was applied to pregnant rats in their final week of gestation, and when their female offspring reached maturity, the long latency effect of the stress on those offspring was ascertained on their induced maternal behavior (MB), accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) morphology and plasma levels of ACTH and corticosterone (Cpd B).","background":"The prenatal external environment can affect fetuses, altering the maternal behavior that they express when mature.","conclusion":"EPS reduced: the percentage of these virgins that showed induced MB, their retrieval of foster pups, the time spent crouching, and the quality of nest building; it also increased the incidence of their cannibalism of foster pups. The EPS-treated females presented a male-like pattern of induced MB. They showed increased plasma levels of ACTH and Cpd B and increased numbers of mitral cells in the AOB. These findings provide evidence that stress applied to the pregnant rat produces long-lasting behavioral, neuroanatomical and hormonal alterations in the female offspring that can be observed when they reach maturity."},{"method":"We recorded from 15 location and six path cells, with color cues positioned near four goal locations. Following color cue rotation, most location cells (12\/15) shifted their response fields; path cells (5\/6) lost their fields.","background":"Pigeon hippocampal neurons display two spatial response profiles: location fields frequently at goals, and path fields connecting goals.","conclusion":"Therefore, local visual cues can independently define a reference frame for location cells, but path cells may be more broadly tuned to context or alternative reference frames."},{"method":"Female mice were fed a diet deficient in vitamin D for 6 weeks prior to conception until birth, after which dams and their offspring were fed a normal diet (i.e. containing vitamin D). Control mice were fed a normal diet throughout the experiment. The adult offspring underwent a comprehensive behavioural test battery at 10 weeks of age.","background":"Developmental vitamin D (DVD) deficiency has been proposed as an environmental risk factor for a number of brain disorders. The absence of this vitamin during foetal development in the rat is known to alter behaviour in the adult, and many of these alterations are informative with respect to the clinical features of schizophrenia. Here we investigated whether DVD deficiency had a similar effect on 129\/SvJ and C57BL\/6J mice.","conclusion":"We found that DVD-deficient mice of both strains exhibited significantly higher levels of exploration, as measured by the frequency of head dipping on the hole board test. In addition, DVD-deficient 129\/SvJ mice, but not C57BL\/6J mice, displayed spontaneous hyperlocomotion. There was no effect of maternal diet on parameters assessed by the SHIRPA primary screen, or on tests of sensorimotor gating, social behaviour, anxiety or depression. Some of these findings resemble the rat phenotype (hyperlocomotion) but there are also novel effects of DVD deficiency on mouse behaviour (increased exploration). This study confirms that the developmental absence of this vitamin affects brain function in another species (mouse), and lends further weight to the hypothesis that DVD deficiency in humans may contribute to adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes."},{"method":"We employed a vasopressin 1b receptor (Avpr1b) knockout mouse to evaluate the role of the vasopressin 1b receptor subtype in the emission of ultrasonic vocalizations in adult and infant mice.","background":"The neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin have been implicated in rodent social and affiliative behaviors, including social bonding, parental care, social recognition, social memory, vocalizations, territoriality, and aggression, as well as components of human social behaviors and the etiology of autism. Previous investigations of mice with various manipulations of the oxytocin and vasopressin systems reported unusual levels of ultrasonic vocalizations in social settings.","conclusion":"Avpr1b null mutant female mice emitted fewer ultrasonic vocalizations, and their vocalizations were generally at lower frequencies, during a resident-intruder test. Avpr1b null mutant pups emitted ultrasonic vocalizations similar to heterozygote and wildtype littermates when separated from the nest on postnatal days 3, 6, 9, and 12. However, maternal potentiation of ultrasonic vocalizations in Avpr1b null and heterozygote mutants was absent, when tested at postnatal day 9. These results indicate that Avpr1b null mutant mice are impaired in the modulation of ultrasonic vocalizations within different social contexts at infant and adult ages."},{"method":"We examined limb force generation and limb timing and coordination during overground locomotion, as well as foot placement errors during locomotion over a horizontal ladder.","background":"The purpose of this research was to compare the locomotor abilities of rats with cervical dorsal spinal funicular (DF) lesions to those of rats with the same lesion at the mid-thoracic level. The dorsal funiculus, consisting of ascending sensory fibers and the main component of the corticospinal tract, was transected either at spinal level C2 or at T8.","conclusion":"At 6 weeks post-surgery, bilateral lesions of the cervical DF caused subtle but persistent changes in the generation of ground reaction forces and limb timing during overground locomotion, and caused persistent forelimb, but not hindlimb, errors during ladder crossing. In contrast, the same lesion at the mid-thoracic level did not affect overground locomotion and caused only minor forelimb and hindlimb errors during ladder walking at 2 weeks post-lesion which recovered to pre-surgical levels by 6 weeks post-lesion. DF lesions at cervical vs. thoracic levels thus have differential effects on locomotor abilities in rats. We compare these results with previous work and suggest that the differential response to DF transection might be related to both functional distinctions between the fore- and hindlimbs and to anatomical differences in the dorsal funiculi at different spinal levels. These findings have implications for the mechanisms of recovery as well as the types of behavioural tests which can be practically used to measure functional changes in different lesion models."},{"method":"Male Long-Evans rats were given unilateral MFB stimulation electrodes and bilateral injection guide cannulae aimed at the SLEAc. Changes in the stimulation's reward efficacy and in the animals' ability to respond for stimulation following 0.5 microl injections of saline, 50 ng of muscimol (GABA-A agonist), 75 ng of baclofen (GABA-B agonist), 25 ng of bicuculline methiodide (GABA-A antagonist), and 500 ng of phaclofen (GABA-B antagonist) were assessed using the rate-frequency curve shift paradigm.","background":"The sublenticular central extended amygdala (SLEAc), which is important in medial forebrain bundle (MFB) self-stimulation, is heavily populated with GABAergic medium spiny neurons that intercommunicate via local axon collaterals. This study examines the role of GABAergic communication in the SLEAc in MFB self-stimulation.","conclusion":"Injecting the receptor agonists ipsi- and contralateral to the stimulation site substantially decreased stimulation reward efficacy and responding. Baclofen's effects were more anatomically specific to the SLEAc and baclofen was less challenging to response rate than was muscimol. Ipsi- and contralateral injections of the receptor blockers and saline had no effect on either stimulation reward efficacy or response rate, although the blockers, especially phaclofen, sometimes enhanced response rate when injected into the globus pallidus or ventral pallidum. Comparing these results to others' observations about GABAergic communication in the basal forebrain suggests that muscimol may have inhibited endemic SLEAc neurons while baclofen may have impaired the release of glutamate into the SLEAc from cortical and amygdalar afferents. These results also suggest functional differences between the two basal forebrain macrostructures of striatopallidum and extended amygdala."},{"method":"We investigated the effects of early weaning on aggressive behaviors under two stress conditions: social stress (social instigation) and ecological stress (food restriction), both of which augment aggression. Male ICR mice were divided into two groups based on weaning period.","background":"The time of weaning has numerous effects on neurobehavioral development. Previous findings suggest that the early weaning influences development of aggressive behaviors. Behavioral and neuroendocrine responsiveness to stressors in the adulthood are also influenced by maternal care received early in life, and early-weaned male mice and rats show higher responsiveness to acute stresses than do normally weaned males. Therefore, it is conceivable that early weaning influences stress-related aggressive behaviors.","conclusion":"Normally weaned mice (weaned PD21) showed twice the baseline level of attack bites after 5 min of social instigation, whereas early-weaned animals (weaned PD14) were not more aggressive following social instigation. However, the early-weaned mice were more aggressive after food restriction stress than were the normally weaned mice, suggesting lower threshold for aggressive behavior after food shortage. We also measured 5HT1A and 5HT1B receptor mRNA expression in the hippocampus which involved in aggression using real-time PCR. Early-weaned mice had lower 5HT1B expression levels than did normally weaned mice; no effect was found for 5HT1A expression. These results suggest that manipulation of weaning time modulates adult aggressive behavior depending on the stressors imposed and that this change may involve the 5HT1B receptor system in the hippocampus."},{"method":"Therefore, in the present work we investigated whether chronic exposure of GA (5 micromol g of body weight(-1), twice per day), the major metabolite accumulating in GA I, during early development (from the 5th to the 28th day of life) could alter the cognitive performance of adult rats in the Morris water maze, open field and elevated plus maze tasks. Control rats were treated with saline in the same volumes.","background":"Glutaric acidemia type I (GA I) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency leading to predominant accumulation of glutaric acid (GA), and to a lesser extent of 3-hydroxyglutaric acid (3HG) in body fluids and tissues. The clinical manifestations of GA I are predominantly neurological. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the brain damage of this disease are virtually unknown, they are thought to be due to the neurotoxic actions of GA and 3HG.","conclusion":"GA administration provoked an impairment of spatial performance in the water maze since adult rats pretreated with GA were not able to remember the previous location of the platform spending significantly less time in the training quadrant. In contrast, GA chronic administration did not affect rat performance in the open field and elevated plus maze tasks, indicating that motor activity and anxiety was not changed by GA. The results provide evidence that early chronic GA treatment induces long-lasting spatial behavioral deficit."},{"method":"Mice with lesions of medial PFC and Sham operated control animals were trained on a series of visual problems in a computer-automated touchscreen apparatus using stimuli that varied in either pattern (lines) or luminance (black-white).","background":"Tests of executive abilities, such as discrimination reversal and attentional set shifting, are sensitive to prefrontal cortex (PFC) damage in primates. The purpose of the present study was to use a primate reversal task to determine if PFC in the mouse is involved in similar cognitive functions.","conclusion":"PFC-lesioned mice learned to discriminate both sets of stimuli as readily as controls, but displayed a stimulus specific (pattern only) deficit on the reversal task. Analysis of error patterns on the line reversal suggests the deficit exhibited by PFC-lesioned mice was related to stimulus specific aspects of visual attention, rather than perseveration. These results demonstrate that medial PFC may play a role in control of directed attention and provide further evidence that the touchscreen procedure can be a useful tool for examining functional similarities in brain regions of very diverse species."},{"method":"In N=96 female participants recruited out of a sample of N=800 subjects according to their genotypes we tested the association between the DRD2 Taq Ia and the COMT Val158Met polymorphisms, and the magnitude of the eye-blink reflex in an acoustic PPI paradigm.","background":"There is plenty of evidence from schizophrenia research and psychopharmacological experiments showing the influence of the dopaminergic neurotransmission on the prepulse inhibition (PPI). A lot of insights into the underlying neural mechanisms of the PPI have been gained from animal models, which are in need to be validated in humans. Due to new technological advances, findings from psychopharmacological challenge tests can now be verified with techniques from molecular genetics which provide an elegant non-invasive approach. To close the gap between animal research and research in humans in this field a molecular genetic approach was applied to investigate the neural mechanisms of the PPI in healthy subjects.","conclusion":"Neither significant influences of both dopaminergic single nucleotide polymorphisms nor an epistasis effect could be detected. Although findings do not support the hypothesis that two of the most prominent dopaminergic candidate loci (DRD2 Taq Ia and COMT Val158Met) effect PPI the study does not exclude the relevance of the dopaminergic system in general. Further molecular genetic studies investigating other variants on dopaminergic genes have to be conducted."},{"method":"Here we report that GAL-DA increases NSA in a spatial novelty in C57BL\/6 mice. They received a single i.p. injection of GAL-DA (10 mg\/kg or 100 mg\/kg) or equimolar galactose vehicle. Another mouse strain the Swiss albino was introduced as inbred control group. Three hours after last injection mice were tested in a L&#xe0;t-maze for 30-min. Behaviour was analyzed for horizontal (traveled distance) and vertical activity (orienting frequency and scanning durations) which shares cognitive and non-cognitive nature, respectively.","background":"Different strategies can be used to carry dopamine into the brain such as L-Dopa precursors or galactosilated form of DA (GAL-DA).

Thus a low dose of GAL-DA increases NSA without reducing hyperactivity in this mouse model of ADHD."},{"method":"A countermanding task which allows dissociation of these two processes was used to examine whether impulsive violent offenders were found to exhibit impaired inhibitory control. An experiment with a time restriction on responding was performed to effectively limit the ability of the subjects to strategically control their error rate.","background":"Impulsive violent criminal behavior is often ascribed to problems with behavioral control. Such behavior could be a consequence of stronger pre-potent responses or a failure of inhibitory control.","conclusion":"The results showed that the performance of the impulsive violent offenders was only impaired in the time pressure condition. These findings suggest that impulsive violent behavior may be linked to abnormal modulation of the frontal cortical areas, areas thought to be involved in response inhibition by negative feedback or emotional responses, rather than frontal dysfunction per se."},{"method":"In the present study, amygdalar neuronal activity was recorded from monkeys during performance of discrimination tasks that led to presentation of emotion-related (rewarding or aversive) stimuli. The task had three phases: (1) discrimination (visual, auditory), (2) operant response (bar pressing) and (3) ingestion (reward) or avoidance (aversion). These neurons were further analyzed by a short-term memory task, delayed pair comparison (DPC) using colored lamps. Of 585 amygdalar neurons, 107 responded primarily to single sensory stimulation (40 vision related, 26 audition related, 41 ingestion related), 117 to multimodal stimulation (multimodal) and 14 responded selectively to only one item (selective). Of 417 neurons tested by the DPC, 122 responded in one or more phases. Of these 122 neurons, 10.7% responded in the delay period.","background":"Recent lesion and non-invasive studies identify the medial temporal lobe, including the amygdala, not only with emotion but also with working memory in relation to the prefrontal cortex.","conclusion":"These delay-responsive neurons also responded to various objects with positive and negative affective significance. These results suggest that amygdalar neurons are not specifically related to working memory, as are those in the inferotemporal and prefrontal cortices, but are related to more general non-specific functions or processes such as arousal or attention during the cognitive tasks. A functional role of the amygdala in working memory is discussed in terms of recent non-invasive studies suggesting a functional coupling between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex."},{"method":"The present study tested 7- and 24-month-old rats on a conditioned flavor preference task. Half of the rats in each age group received an unsweetened grape-flavored solution (CS-) on odd-numbered days and a sweetened cherry-flavored solution (CS+) on even-numbered days. The remaining rats in each age group received a sweetened grape-flavored solution (CS+) on odd-numbered days and an unsweetened cherry-flavored solution (CS-) on even-numbered days. During the acquisition phase of testing, the designated solution (CS+ or CS-) was presented to each rat for 15 min daily across six consecutive days. On the preference phase, each rat received unsweetened cherry and unsweetened grape-flavored solutions simultaneously for 15 min daily across four consecutive days.","background":"Age-related changes have been documented in regions of the brain shown to process reward information. However, few studies have examined the effects of aging on associative memory for reward.","conclusion":"The 7-month-old rats showed a significant preference for the flavor that was previously sweetened during the acquisition phase (CS+) compared to the previously unsweetened solution (CS-) when the two unsweetened solutions were presented simultaneously during the preference phase of testing. In contrast, the 24-month-old rats did not show a preference and consumed roughly equal amounts of the previously sweetened (CS+) and unsweetened (CS-) solutions. Thus, the data suggest that the ability to form flavor-reward associations declines with increasing age, resulting in impaired conditioned flavor preference."},{"method":"We conducted series of experiments to further investigate the effect of castration or intra hippocampal injection of T on acquisition, consolidation and retrieval of inhibitory avoidance learning and memory. Male adult rats were bilaterally cannulated into CA1 of hippocampus, and then received T (1, 10, 20, 40 and 80mug\/0.5mul\/side) or vehicle (DMSO), 30min before training, immediately after training and 30min before retrieval in inhibitory avoidance task. Castration was made by gonadectomy of male rats and behavioral tests performed 4 weeks later.","background":"The hippocampus is essentially involved in learning and memory, and is known to be a target for androgen actions. Androgen receptors are densely expressed in CA1 of rat hippocampus, and mediate the effects of testosterone (T) on learning and memory. T depletion or administration can modulate neural function and cognitive performance.","conclusion":"Our results showed that gonadectomy of male rats did not influence performance on inhibitory avoidance task, as compared to sham-operated rats. We have also found that pre-training, post-training and pre-retrieval intra CA1 injections of T significantly decreased step-through latencies in inhibitory avoidance learning at doses 1 and 80, 20, and 20 and 40mug\/0.5mul\/side, respectively. The data suggest that intra CA1 administration of T could impair learning and memory acquisition, consolidation and retrieval, while systemic androgen's depletion have no effect on memory, in inhibitory avoidance task."},{"method":"We performed a gene expression study in two brain areas (midbrain and medulla) after surgical induction of CCI in Cckbr KO and wild-type (wt) control mice.","background":"The cholecystokinin B (2) receptor knockout (Cckbr KO) protects against allodynia induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI). The mechanism of this phenomenon is unknown, but must involve persistent changes in pain modulation and\/or inflammatory pathways.","conclusion":"The patterns of gene expression differences suggest that the immune system is activated in higher brain structures following CCI in the wt mice. The strongest differences include genes related to the MAPK pathway activation and cytokine production. In Cckbr KO mice this expressional pattern was absent. In addition, we found significant elevation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4) in the supraspinal structures of the mice with deleted Cckbr compared to wt control mice. This up-regulation is most likely induced by the deletion of Cckbr. We suggest that there is a functional deficiency in the Tlr4 pathway which disables the development of neuropathic pain in Cckbr KO mice. Indeed, real time PCR analysis detected a CCI-induced upregulation of Tlr4 and Il1b expression in the lumbar region of wt but not Cckbr KO mice. Gene expression profiling indicates that elements of the immune response are not activated in Cckbr KO mice following CCI. Our findings suggest that there may be a role for CCK in the regulation of innate immunity."},{"method":"Twelve healthy, right-handed volunteers were required to observe video clips of hand gestures and of object related grasping movements while the regional cerebral blood flow was measured using positron emission tomography. The subjects were instructed either to imitate the actions or to judge the velocity of the observed movements after scanning.","background":"We aimed to investigate the brain areas engaged in observation of hand movements with the intention of imitation or judging movement velocity. Both processes reflect different analytic approaches in movement observation. We were interested if these two processes can be distinguished or share common activation foci.","conclusion":"Action observation with the instruction to judge movement velocity engaged bilaterally the temporo-occipital junction and adjacent visual cortical areas. In contrast, observation with the instruction to imitate them afterwards, yielded large activation clusters covering the left parietal and premotor cortex. Both contrasts demonstrated activation in the inferior frontal cortex, however, on opposite sides. Results suggest that movement observation with the goal of imitation activated specific areas of the parietal cortex in the dominant hemisphere probably related to programming of the movement kinematics. In contrast, observation with the goal to characterize the velocity of the finger movements activated the ventral visual pathways. Thus, movement observation recruits non-overlapping cortical networks, depending on the information attended to which are characterised by a dorsal ventral dissociation."},{"method":"Here, we used two types of depressive animal models by exposing rats to chronic mild stress (CMS) and by chronically administering the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine (CLI) in the rat during the neonatal state of life to produce adult depressed rats. We investigated the effects of lateral habenular nucleus (LHb) lesions on the behavioral response and on the level of 5-HT in DRN in the depressed rats.","background":"The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN)-serotonin (5-HT) system plays a key role in stress-related psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression. The habenular nucleus (Hb) is closely connected with the DRN both morphologically and functionally.","conclusion":"Forced-swimming test (FST) showed that the immobility time decreased, and the climbing time increased after lesioning LHb of depressed rats. Microdialysis results indicated that the 5-HT level in DRN in depressed rats was lower than that of the control group. Lesion of the LHb was followed by an increased 5-HT turnover in the DRN. Our results suggested that the lesion of the LHb could improve the behavioral response of the depressed rats and the 5-HT level of the DRN increased by LHb lesions could be involved in the effects."},{"method":"Bilateral microinjections of DNQX (330 and 660 ng) into the Acb shell (AP, +1.08 to +2.16) induced an anxiolytic-like effect in relation to rats microinjected with vehicle, since there was an increased percentage of entries in the open arms of the maze. The 660 ng DNQX microinjection into the Acb shell also increased the percentage of entries into the open arms in relation to 660 ng DNQX microinjection into the Acb core. Prior DNQX microinjections in both core and shell sub-regions of the Acb failed to impair the emotional learning, since the animals exhibited an increase of the open arm avoidance on EPM Trial 2 in relation to EPM trial 1. DNQX microinjections into both sub-regions of the Acb did not change the number of entries into the enclosed arms, either in the EPM Trial 1 or in the EPM Trial 2, which indicates an absence of drug-induced locomotor impairment.

Somatosensory cues from dorsal contact to the nape of the neck, critical to the initiation of pinning, were systematically degraded by administration of different doses of xylocaine, a topical anesthetic. Neuronal activity after 1h of play was assessed by measurement of c-Fos immunoreactivity (IR) in different brain regions.","background":"Developmental exposure to alcohol can produce characteristic physiological and cognitive deficits, often termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). More recently, social deficits have been shown to occur both in FASD and animal models of FASD; the behavioral and neural bases of these deficits remain to be determined. It was hypothesized that changes in sensory processing may in part underlie the social deficits seen in FASD.","conclusion":"Ethanol-exposed rats showed an increased frequency of pinning during social play and were more sensitive to the degradation of somatosensory cues compared to the control groups, suggesting difficulties in processing somatosensory cues. Neuronal activity in the somatosensory cortex induced by play was significantly decreased in the ethanol-exposed group compared to the non-treated group. The c-Fos IR in the nucleus accumbens was altered in a sexually dimorphic manner in the ethanol-exposed group. Thus, the behavioral and brain measures are consistent with the hypothesis that ethanol exposure during development induces alterations in social play via deficits in processing somatosensory cues that are important to social play."},{"method":"Adult rats were trained on the Whishaw single pellet reaching task prior to receiving a devascularizing stroke lesion of the motor cortex.

At the end of the experiment the brains were processed for Golgi-Cox staining and dendritic length was measured in layer V of the intact forelimb motor area, layer III of Zilles' area Cg3 and layer II\/III of Zilles' area AID.","background":"Social interactions have previously been shown to influence stroke outcome. In the current experiment we investigated the effects of a changing social environment on anatomical and behavioral recovery following motor cortex stroke in rats.","conclusion":"Social experience was found to completely block the normal spontaneous behavioural restitution in the lesion animals. Anatomically, whereas social experience selectively increased dendritic length in AID in rats that had not undergone behavioral training or the stroke procedure, this was not seen in the lesion animals, as the lesion alone produced an increase in dendritic length in both AID and Cg3. The findings are discussed in terms of the role of social experiences, including stress, on spontaneous plasticity that occurs following unilateral motor cortex stroke, and the effectiveness of inducing synaptic plasticity to promote behavioural recovery."},{"method":"In the current paper, we investigate the behavioral responses of zebrafish elicited by its alarm substance.

This small vertebrate may be utilized in modeling human brain disorders. One of the major neuropsychiatric conditions still not well understood is abnormally increased fear and anxiety. Zebrafish may be an appropriate organism with which these human diseases can be modeled and their biological mechanisms investigated.

However, the subjects of the neurochemical experiments were asked to predict reward onset over longer intervals (12s, on average) than the subjects of the electrophysiological studies (typically, 2s). Thus, the contrasting effects of reward predictability could reflect the difference in the duration of the interval separating the predictor from the reward rather than a difference in the influence of reward predictability on phasic and tonic DA signaling.","conclusion":"Despite the shortened inter-train interval, the time courses of the observed stimulation-induced elevations in DA levels were very similar, regardless of whether train onset was predictable. This finding is consistent with the idea that tonic DA signaling is insensitive to the predictability of rewards."},{"method":"In the present study, the effect of an H(3)-receptor inverse agonist on hypothalamic histamine release and energy intake was investigated in normal and DIO mice. Leptin (1.3 mg\/kg, i.p.) significantly increased hypothalamic histamine release and reduced 12 h-energy intake in normal mice, but had no such effects in DIO mice. In contrast, clobenpropit (5 mg\/kg, i.p.), an H(3)-inverse agonist, elicited a significant increase in histamine release in both types of mice.","background":"Leptin is a key signal linking peripheral adiposity levels to the regulation of energy homeostasis in the brain. The injection of leptin decreases body weight and food intake in lean rodents; however, in a rodent model of high fat diet-induced obesity (DIO), the exogenous leptin cannot improve adiposity. This ineffectiveness is known as leptin resistance, and the factors downstream of leptin signaling have received attention as viable targets in the treatment of obesity. We previously reported that the histaminergic system is one of the targets of leptin.","conclusion":"Clobenpropit did not reduce 12 h-energy intake; however, it decreased 3 h-energy intake in both types of mice. These results suggest that lack of the activation of the histaminergic system partly contributes to obesity in DIO mice and direct activation of the histaminergic system circumvents leptin resistance."},{"method":"We investigated emotional and cognitive behavioural domains in mice deficient in cav-1 (CavKO mice).","background":"Neurological phenotypes associated with loss of caveolin 1 (cav-1) (the defining structural protein in caveolar vesicles, which regulate signal transduction and cholesterol trafficking in cells) in mice have been reported recently. In brain, cav-1 is highly expressed in neurons and glia.","conclusion":"CavKO mice were more anxious and spent more time in self-directed grooming behaviour than wild-type (wt) mice. In a spatial\/working memory task, CavKO mice failed to recognize the object displacement, thus showing a spatial memory impairment. CavKO mice showed higher locomotor activity than wt mice, thus suggesting reduced inhibitory function by CNS cholinergic systems. Behavioural response to the cholinergic muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine (2 mg\/Kg), was decreased in CavKO mice. Few behavioural sex differences emerged in mice; whereas the sex differences were generally attenuated or even reverted in the null genotype. Our data confirm a distinct behavioural phenotype in CavKO mice and indicate a selective alteration in central cholinergic function."},{"method":"Pregnant rats were randomly assigned to control (CN) or iron-deficient (ID) groups by providing iron-sufficient (40 ppm Fe) or iron-deficient (2-6 ppm Fe) diets from gestational day 5 through to weaning of pups. Thereafter, all offspring were fed the iron-sufficient diet. The myelination of subcortical white matter and the fimbria of hippocampus was measured by 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase (CNPase, marker of oligodendrocyte) density at 25 days of age. Specific behavioral assessments were performed at multiple time points after birth.","background":"Iron deficiency in early development has been associated with irreversible alterations in brain myelination, but whether these neural changes are mirrored in altered behaviors in rats is not known. The goals were to determine if dietary induced gestational and lactational iron deficiency alters brain myelination and behaviors dependent on that system.","conclusion":"By contrast, ID rats had significantly lower density of CNPase in the subcortical white matter but the density of CNPase in fimbria of hippocampus was comparable to CN rats. Moreover, ID rats showed significant behavioral impairments in surface righting reflex, negative geotaxis reflex, vibrissae-evoked forelimb placing test and novel object recognition task. In conclusion, perinatal iron deficiency can significantly alter behavioral outcomes which may be due to delayed myelination in specific brain regions."},{"method":"Dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunoreactivity (DBH-ir) was quantified in thirteen brain regions (five vocal control nuclei, one auditory nucleus, two hypothalamic nuclei, and five additional areas that demonstrated high DBH labeling in controls).","background":"When administered systemically, the noradrenergic neurotoxin N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4) appears to target the noradrenergic innervation originating in the locus coeruleus causing long-term decrements in noradrenergic function. In songbirds, DSP-4-treatment decreased female-directed singing by males and copulation solicitation responses of females to male songs. However, DSP-4 treatment in songbirds did not lower measures of NE function in the brain to the same extent as it does in mammals. The current study had two goals: determining if two DSP-4 treatments 10 days apart would cause significant decrements in noradrenergic function in male zebra finches and determining if, as in other species, the noradrenergic innervation of midbrain and cortical areas would be profoundly affected while hypothalamic areas were spared.","conclusion":"Within 20 days, DSP-4 treatment profoundly reduced the number of DBH-ir cells in both the locus coeruleus and ventral subcoeruleus. Unlike a previous study, DBH labeling delineated four out of five vocal control nuclei and an auditory nucleus. As expected, DSP-4 treatment significantly decreased DBH labeling in all areas examined in the mesencephalon and telencephalon without significantly affecting DBH-ir in hypothalamic areas. This double treatment regime appears to be much more effective in decreasing noradrenergic function in songbirds than the single treatment typically used."},{"method":"In the present study, DOI (1 microg, 2 microg or 5 microg per mice) was directly injected to three brain structures, the hippocampus, the amygdala and the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG).

In the hippocampus, a strong anxiolytic-like effect was found only when injecting 5 microg DOI\/mice in the FPT, with a size effect comparable to the anxiolytic-like effect of diazepam 1mg\/kg injected intra-peritoneally. DOI or vehicle injections did not affect locomotor activity. These results help us to understand mechanisms of action of DOI in animal models of anxiety, probably through an interaction with other neurotransmitter system, which may take place in the hippocampus."},{"method":"We observed that, in fact, scopolamine reduced the shocks perception. Since, on the hot plate test, scopolamine did not affect latencies of avoidance reactions, this effect did not correspond to analgesia.","background":"In a passive avoidance paradigm, administration of scopolamine in mice seems to provoke forgetting of electric shocks they received when entering into the black compartment.","conclusion":"Thus, in our experimental conditions, scopolamine effect did not exclusively result from a deficit of passive avoidance learning but likely resulted from its anti-sweating properties, thus reducing the shocks perception."},{"method":"Motor behavior of P-gp deficient mice (mdr1a\/1b (-\/-, -\/-)) and wild type animals on a rotarod after acute doses of risperidone or haloperidol, a nonsubstrate of P-gp, were analysed aiming to show that P-gp substrate properties of an antipsychotic drug have functional consequences.

A dose of 0.3 mg\/kg haloperidol, however, exhibited similar pharmacodynamic effects in both genotypes. Brain concentrations of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone were 10-fold higher in knockout than in wild type animals whereas brain concentrations of haloperidol did not differ between the two genotypes.

The ability of this 5-HT(6) receptor antagonist in counteracting hypermotility, stereotypies and ataxia produced by MK-801 were evaluated in a motor activity cage.","background":"There are experimental evidences indicating that the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 impairs cognition and produces a series of schizophrenia-like symptoms in rodents (hypermotility, stereotypies and ataxia).","conclusion":"Post-training administration of Ro 04-6790 (10 and to some extent also 3mg\/kg) antagonized MK-801-induced performance deficits in a recognition memory test. In a subsequent study, Ro 04-6790 (3 and 10 mg\/kg) reversed hypermotility and ataxia produced by MK-801. This 5-HT(6) receptor antagonist also alleviated MK-801-induced certain stereotypies. Our findings indicate that Ro 04-6790 attenuates behavioural effects related to the hypofunction of the NMDA receptor suggesting that this compound might be involved in the psychotomimetic effects of non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists."},{"method":"Animals receiving a single zinc dose (5, 15 and 30 mg\/kg, i.p.) 24 h prior to analysis showed no changes in the FST, but glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase activity were reduced in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. This treatment did not, however, affect the glutathione status (GSH and GSSG) in both brain structures. The 7-day zinc treatment (1, 5 and 15 mg\/kg, i.p.) caused a mild though significant antidepressant-like effect in the FST at the highest dosing, without affecting the glutathione antioxidant system.

It was also investigated whether the antidepressant-like effect of zinc is associated with changes in the glutathione antioxidant system in the Wistar rat brain.","conclusion":"The good response to oral treatment in the FST led us to investigate other variables, such as ERK phosphorylation and BDNF expression. Similar to therapeutic antidepressants, zinc in chronic oral treatment produced an increase in ERK phosphorylation and BDNF expression in the cerebral cortex. It is our hypothesis that up-regulation of neuroprotective effectors (GSH, ERK and BDNF) may be related to the antidepressant properties of zinc, but this will require additional work to be confirmed."},{"method":"Only the highest dose of agmatine tested (50 mg\/kg) decreased immobility of mice in the forced swimming test.

Pretreatment with the tryptophane hydroxylase inhibitor PCPA for 3 days resulted in more than 70% drop in the tissue levels of 5-HT and 5-HIIA but did not counteract the antidepressant-like effect of agmatine.

Non-defensive behaviours were suppressed during early exposures, but this suppression habituated across repeated exposures. Overall, the pattern of behavioural results indicated enhanced responses to novelty and to repeated cat odour exposure, in females, relative to males. Plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels were higher in females relative to males overall. However, males, but not females, exposed to cat odour had higher levels of CORT following exposure on Days 1 and 22, relative to controls.

Functional connectivity analysis demonstrated less functional connectivity between the caudate and prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia regions in the HIV+ group. In contrast, the HIV+ group demonstrated increased activation of right postcentral\/supramarginal gyrus, and greater connectivity between the caudate and this same anterior parietal region. The results of this study extend previous investigations by demonstrating compromised function of the caudate and connected prefrontal regions in HIV during cognition.

Experimental studies show that LAMP promotes the growth of limbic neurons and guides the projections of limbic fibers.","conclusion":"The most profound change in behavior in both male and female Lsamp(-\/-) mice is a heightened reactivity to novelty exhibited in several behavioral tests. Lsamp(-\/-) mice display hyperactivity in a novel arena and both sexes habituate to the same activity levels as their wild type littermates, but at different rates. In the elevated plus maze, Lsamp(-\/-) mice exhibit increased total arm entries, with a bias towards the open arms; they spend more time in the open arms and have a substantial increase in the amount of risk assessment in unprotected areas of the maze. In the y-maze, Lsamp(-\/-) mice exhibit characteristic hyperactivity and a decreased level of spontaneous alternation during the period when their novelty-induced hyperactivity is at its peak. We hypothesize that Lsamp(-\/-) mice may not simply exhibit a decrease in anxiety, but may have a heightened, and possibly maladaptive, response to novel environmental stressors.

We have hypothesized that dopaminergic D(2) receptor blockage induced by haloperidol could generate a reduction or even an ablation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Otherwise, the use of the selective D(2) agonist, piribedil, could potentiate REM sleep.","conclusion":"This reduction of REM sleep was accompanied by an increment in SWS, which is possibly accounted for the observed increase in the sleep efficiency. Conversely, our findings also demonstrate that the administration of piribedil did not generate additional increase of REM sleep. Additionally, D(2) receptors were found down-regulated, in the haloperidol group, after RSD, and subsequently up-regulated after REB group, contrasting to the D(1) down-regulation at the same period. In this sense, the current data indicate a participation of the D(2) receptor for REM sleep regulation and consequently in the REM sleep\/SWS balance. Herein, we propose that the mechanism underlying the striatal D(2) up-regulation is due to an effect as consequence of RSD which originally produces selective D(2) supersensitivity, and after its period probably generates a surge in D(2) expression.

Memantine, on the other hand, is a low affinity antagonist which does not disrupt glutamate-mediated neuroplasticity, and it had little if any effect on any measure of pemoline-induced SIB.

In fact, the untreated migraineurs, compared to treated, recalled the most emotional phase of the arousal story significantly better. Then, our data suggest that amitriptyline prevents the enhancing effects of emotional content on memory processes.

The training did not significantly influence the results on the bar and ladder. In the rotarod test, young trained Lurchers achieved only slightly better results than untrained ones. In adult mice, the improvement was insignificant. Lurchers failed in spatial learning test compared to the wild type mice. In the wild type mice there was no difference in learning between young and adult individuals, while young Lurchers learned better than older ones. Enforced motor activity led to spatial learning improvement in older Lurchers, but not in young ones.

Daily treatment with thalidomide (20 mg\/kg), a preferential degrader of TNF-alpha mRNA, or i.c.v.-injection of an anti-TNF-alpha antibody (10 etag\/mouse) prevented the nitration of proteins in the hippocampus and the impairment of recognition memory induced by Abeta(25-35) or Abeta(1-40) in mice.","background":"No effective remedy has currently been realized to prevent the cognitive impairments of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The interruption of the toxic pathways of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) still remains promising for the treatment. The involvement of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the toxicity of Abeta(1-40) in recent reports provide a fresh target for the interruption.","conclusion":"These results suggested the practicability of targeting TNF-alpha as a preventive strategy against Abeta-mediated cognitive impairments."},{"method":"Male adult rats were implanted into the ventral hippocampus with microinjection cannulae and subjected consecutively to 2 sessions of 8 trials to learn an avoidance response after an ultrasonic tone of 40 kHz was on, as it was previously described. Immediately after the training period was over, or 15 min after, different groups of rats were microinjected with saline, histamine or a combination of histamine H(1)- or H(2)-receptor antagonists. Twenty four hours later, animals were tested in a new session for the retention of the avoiding response.","background":"Previous evidence from our laboratory has shown that histamine receptors located into the ventral hippocampus modulate learning and memory processes. Stimulation of histamine hippocampal sensitive receptors during the acquisition phase of a conditioned avoidance response to an ultrasonic tone was able to increase latency to escape and impair memory in the rat. Histamine application into the same hippocampal region also impaired the evocation of the response. The purpose of the present work was to evaluate if histaminergic neuron circuits have participation on the consolidation processes of the conditioned avoiding response.","conclusion":"Results showed that histamine treatment interfered with the consolidation of the avoiding response, affecting latency and the memory efficiency. This interference was mediated by histamine H(1)- and H(2)-receptors, since pretreatment with pyrilamine or ranitidine blocked the inhibitory effect of histamine. Results support the concept that histaminergic neurotransmission modulates learning and memory by affecting selectively the three stages of learning."},{"method":"We evaluated the efficacy of (-)-BPAP as a drug for mood disorders by using two animal models. (1) Acute, but not chronic, administration of (-)-BPAP and imipramine significantly attenuated immobility in mice induced by forced swimming. Chronic, but not acute, administration of (-)-BPAP ameliorated the impairment of social interaction (SI) behavior following forced swimming, without affecting locomotor activity. The ameliorating effect of (-)-BPAP on the impairment of SI behavior was suppressed by dopamine receptor antagonists, which suggests that the effect was mediated through the activation of the dopaminergic system. Chronic administration of imipramine tended to attenuate the impairment of SI behavior in stressed mice, but not significantly. (2) In the olfactory bulbectomized (OB) rat, chronic (-)-BPAP treatment significantly ameliorated the impairment of SI behavior, prepulse inhibition, and tone-cue fear learning, without affecting locomotor activity in an open field and circadian activity pattern. Furthermore, (-)-BPAP tended to improve sexual dysfunction in OB rats, but imipramine had no such effect.","background":"(R)-(-)-1-(Benzofuran-2-yl)-2-propylaminopentane hydrochloride [(-)-BPAP] is a highly potent enhancer of impulse propagation-mediated monoamine release and an inhibitor of monoamine uptake.","conclusion":"These findings suggest that (-)-BPAP may be clinically effective in treating mood disorders, including comorbid anxiety and depression that are poorly responsive to imipramine."},{"method":"Two days later, spinal GABA release was estimated by in vivo microdialysis. In other set of rats, either diazepam (2 mg\/kg, i.p.) or saline was administered 1h before either SS or FS and inflammatory nociception was assessed with the formalin test; it was followed by removal of lumbar spinal cords for c-Fos immunocytochemistry.","background":"We determined if cutaneous hyperalgesia and pain-induced c-Fos overexpression in the spinal cord produced by repeated forced swimming (FS) stress in the rat were related to changes in GABA neurotransmission by studying spinal release of GABA and the effect of positive modulation of GABA-A receptors with diazepam. Male rats were daily submitted to 10-20 min of either forced swimming or sham swimming (SS) for 3 consecutive days.","conclusion":"Basal and pain-evoked release of GABA in the spinal cord was lower in FS rats than in SS rats. In contrast, pain scores during formalin test late phase and pain-induced c-Fos expression in laminae I-VI of ipsilateral dorsal horn were significantly higher in FS rats than in SS rats. In FS rats, diazepam did not have effect on GABA release but reduced pain scores and overexpression of c-Fos whereas flumazenil (0.1 mg\/kg, i.p.), an antagonist of the benzodiazepine binding site, reversed these effects. When diazepam was given only 1h before the formalin test, it slightly but significantly reduced pain scores during late phase in FS rats but not in SS rats. In conclusion, stress-induced reduction in GABA-A receptor activation is involved in the development of FS stress-induced hyperalgesia."},{"method":"The expression of AChE-R was blocked with a systemically administered central acting antisense oligonucleotide for AChE-R (EN101). EN101 was injected at multiple points prior to and after a predator stress in male C57 mice. Seven days after the last injection, behavior was tested.","background":"This study examined the role of the read through variant of acetylcholinesterase (AChE-R) in lasting changes in murine affective behavior produced by a brief predator stress. AChE-R is elevated by stress in limbic cholinergic circuits implicated in anxiogenic effects of predator stress.","conclusion":"Predator stress caused a significant increase in startle amplitude, which EN101 blocked. This effect was specific to EN101, as the negative control inactive form of EN101, INVEN101 was without effect on stress effects on startle. Neither EN101 nor INVEN101 altered the anxiogenic effects of predator stress on behavior in the elevated plus maze, and both drugs partially reduced stress suppression of time active in the hole board. In the light dark box test, INVEN101 exhibited a weak block of stress effects on behavior for reasons which are unclear. Taken together, findings support the view that multiple neural systems are responsible for the different changes in behavior produced by predator stress. Present findings also suggest a role for AChE-R in specific anxiogenic (hyperarousal) effects following predator stress. Since AChE-R manipulations took place starting 23 h prior to predator stress and continued 48 h after predator stress, further research is necessary to determine the role of AChE-R in initiation and\/or consolidation of hyperarousal effects of predator stress."},{"method":"Four different cohorts of control and Tg2576 mice, aged approximately 3, 9, 13 and 21 months, were therefore subjected to a battery of tests, principally to assess cognitive and species-typical behaviors. A novel test, the paddling Y-maze, demonstrated an age-dependent deficit in 10 and 14, but not 3 month Tg2576 mice, also in aged (21 month) control mice. However, in many other cognitive tests few Tg2576-related deficits could be shown. This frequently seemed attributable to poor performance of control mice. Tests of species-typical behaviors showed that Tg2576 mice had a deficit in burrowing behavior at all ages. An age-independent deficit was also seen in nest construction, but only when mice were group-housed; most individually housed mice in either group made reasonable nests.","background":"The Tg2576 mouse model of excessive cerebral beta-amyloid deposition is now more than a decade old, yet consensus as to its exact characteristics and utility as a model of Alzheimer's disease is still lacking.","conclusion":"Overall, the results suggested that these Tg2576 mice are not a simple, suitable or reliable model for routine screening of treatments for Alzheimer's disease. However, this model might perform better behaviorally on a different genetic background."},{"method":"The present study describes the effect of the combined treatment of Long-Evans rats with alpha1-adrenergic and D2 antagonists prazosin (1mg\/kg and 2 mg\/kg) and sulpiride (10 mg\/kg and 30 mg\/kg) on locomotion and avoidance behavior in the AAPA task.","background":"The processing of spatial information is the focus of interest for many cognitive neuroscientists. Approximately 10 years ago, a novel behavioral paradigm called active allothetic place avoidance (AAPA) was designed allowing the simultaneous assessment of locomotor and spatial behavior.","conclusion":"Results show that co-application of both drugs leads to disturbances in locomotion and avoidance in rats at the doses, which caused no impairments when administered independently. This finding suggests that both types of receptors act synergistically to regulate locomotion and possibly spatial behavior."},{"method":"Animals received either sham-operation, a 3-min ischemia, a preconditioning 3-min global ischemia followed 3 days later by a 6-min global ischemia or a single 6-min global ischemia. Open field habituation, memory performance in the 8-arm radial maze and object recognition were assessed at different intervals following ischemia.","background":"In ischemic preconditioning, prior exposure to a short 3-min global ischemia provides substantial protection against the deleterious effects of a subsequent prolonged ischemic insult in rats. The objective of the present study was to determine if the neuronal protection induced by ischemic preconditioning influence functional recovery following a 6-min ischemic insult in rats.","conclusion":"Our findings revealed that preconditioning reversed ischemia-induced spatial memory deficits in the 8-arm radial maze, as suggested by significant reduction of working memory errors in preconditioned as compared to ischemic animals. Preconditioning also attenuated ischemia-induced object recognition deficits at short-term intervals. Nonetheless, preconditioning failed to alter ischemia-induced hyperactivity as demonstrated by enhanced behavioral activity in the open field in both preconditioned and ischemic animals compared to 3-min ischemic and sham-operated rats. CA1 cell counts revealed significant neuronal sparing in preconditioned animals that was observed 6-month following reperfusion. Together, these findings suggest that neuronal survival in preconditioned rats is associated with significant improvements of hippocampal-dependent memory functions and, further support that ischemia-induced hyperactivity may not solely depend on selective neuronal damage to hippocampal neurons."},{"method":"We generated forebrain-specific CRE-mediated conditional beta-catenin knock-out mice to begin exploring the behavioral implications of decreased Wnt pathway signaling in the central nervous system. In situ hybridization revealed a progressive knock-out of beta-catenin that began between 2 and 4 weeks of age, and by 12 weeks resulted in considerably decreased beta-catenin expression in regions of the forebrain, including the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. A significant decrease in protein levels of beta-catenin in these brain regions was observed by Western blot. Behavioral characterization of these mice in several tests (including the forced swim test, tail suspension test (TST), learned helplessness, response and sensitization to stimulants, and light\/dark box among other tests) revealed relatively circumscribed alterations.","background":"The canonical Wnt pathway and beta-catenin have been implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders.","conclusion":"In the TST, knock-out mice spent significantly less time struggling (a depression-like phenotype). However, knock-out mice did not differ from their wild-type littermates in the other behavioral tests of mood-related or anxiety-related behaviors. These results suggest that a 60-70% beta-catenin reduction in circumscribed brain regions is only capable of inducing subtle behavioral changes. Alternatively, regulating beta-catenin may modulate drug effects rather than being a model of mood disorder pathophysiology per se."},{"method":"In the present study physical fitness, anxiety, and learning\/memory-related tasks were assessed in mice lacking NPY or a functional ARC after dietary manipulation by CR. Physical fitness was improved by CR when measured by inclined screen and rotarod, and this diet effect was not affected by NPY or ARC status. As has been observed previously, the NPY knockout mice displayed heightened anxiety in an open field. This phenotype was not fully recapitulated in the ARC-lesioned model. CR affected neither total locomotor activity in the open field nor thigmotaxic behavior in these models.","background":"A major neuroendocrinological effect of calorie restriction (CR) is induction of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). Aside from its appetite-stimulating effects, NPY is thought to be involved in the modulation of behavioral processes including anxiety and learning and memory.","conclusion":"Neither NPY nor CR had a significant effect on Morris water maze performance; however, ARC-damaged mice were unable to learn the task, and this deficit was not corrected by CR. We conclude that despite established effects of CR on ARC signaling, our results suggest a mechanistic separation between the two where behavior is concerned."},{"method":"To begin to address this issue, we generated a transgenic mouse line (Cal(OE)) using the human calcyon cDNA in which calcyon expression is up-regulated in a number of forebrain structures including the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), striatum, and amygdala.","background":"Gene linkage and association studies have implicated the region of chromosome 10q containing the calcyon locus with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia susceptibility. In addition, levels of calcyon protein and transcripts are also significantly increased in postmortem tissue from schizophrenic brains.

These mice exhibited high rates of stereotypy when reared in standard rodent cages, and such behaviour was significantly attenuated by housing them in larger more complex environments.","background":"Restricted, repetitive behaviours (e.g., stereotypies, compulsions, rituals) in neurodevelopmental disorders have been linked to alterations in cortico-basal ganglia circuitry. Cognitive processes mediated by this circuitry (e.g., procedural learning, executive function) are likely to be impaired in individuals exhibiting high rates of repetitive behaviour.","conclusion":"Mice reared in complex environments exhibited significantly better procedural and reversal learning than standard caged mice. Thus, early experience associated with the prevention and attenuation of stereotypy was associated with better striatally mediated learning and cognitive flexibility. Stereotypy score was significantly correlated with the number of errors made in reversal learning, and interacted with housing condition to affect overall cognitive performance. Our findings support the applicability of the deer mouse model of spontaneous stereotypy to a wider range of restricted, repetitive behaviour (e.g., insistence on sameness) typical of neurodevelopmental disorders."},{"method":"In this study, inhibitory avoidance (IA) learning task used to find the LC function in acquisition, consolidation and retrieval. Saline or lidocaine 4% (0.5 microl\/side) microinjected into the LC, for assessing the acquisition (5 min before training), consolidation (5, 90 and 360 min after training) and memory retrieval, 5 min before testing.

(2) The lidocaine-induced inactivation of LC only 5 min after training impaired consolidation but did not affect it after 90 or 360 min. (3) Inactivation of the LC, 5 min before pre-retrieval test, impaired memory retrieval in IA task.

Mammalian sleep is composed of two neurophysiological states: slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Given that the intensity of stimuli required to induce an arousal to wakefulness is highest during deep SWS or REM sleep, mammals may be most vulnerable during these states. If true, then animals should selectively reduce deep SWS and REM sleep following an increase in the risk of predation.","conclusion":"Immediately following the encounter, rats spent more time awake and less time in SWS and REM sleep. The reduction of SWS was due to the shorter duration of SWS episodes, whereas the reduction of REM sleep was due to a lower number of REM sleep episodes. The onset of SWS and REM sleep was delayed post-encounter by about 20 and 100 min, respectively. The reduction of REM sleep was disproportionately large during the first quarter of the sleep phase, and slow wave activity (SWA) (0.5-4.5 Hz power density) was lower during the first 10 min of SWS post-encounter. An increase in SWA and REM sleep was observed later in the sleep phase, which may reflect sleep homeostasis. These results suggest that aspects of sleep architecture can be adjusted to the prevailing risk of predation."},{"method":"The aim of the present study was to investigate the duration-dependent dendritic changes in CA1, CA3 and entorhinal cortex (EC) of hippocampus and layer II of prefrontal cortex (PFC) with spatial memory functions in rats on exposure to different duration of HH.

There was impairment of spatial memory after 3 and 7 days of exposure, but slight improvement of spatial memory was noted after 14 and 21 days of exposure.

Their covert motor incoordination was evident in a correlation analysis which unveiled decreased harmonisation of concurrent gait parameters. For example, while ASA(+\/-) controls demonstrated substantial convergence of front and hind base width (r=0.54), these variables actually diverged in ASA(-\/-) mice (r=-0.37).

When animals are trained in inhibitory avoidance with relatively high foot-shock intensities, other amnesic treatments have no effect.","conclusion":"When compared to saline-injected groups trained with the same intensities, PCA produced a significant learning deficit in the low foot-shock groups, but not in the high foot-shock animals. These results indicate that the dose of PCA administered, which is known to deplete cerebral serotonin, does not interfere with acquisition and retention of enhanced active avoidance training."},{"method":"Here, we analyzed the effects of prolonged administration of heroin and methadone, as well as the impact of suffering repeated episodes of withdrawal on fear-motivated learning using the passive avoidance test.

Access to a running wheel had no effects on cognitive or neuropathological parameters, but reduced the amount of stereotypic behaviour in transgenics significantly. Furthermore, wheel-running was inversely correlated with stereotypic behaviour, suggesting that wheel-running may have stereotypic qualities. In addition, wheel-running positively correlated with plaque burden. Thus, in a phase when plaques are already present in the brain, it may be symptomatic of brain pathology, rather than protective.

This finding demonstrated that male mice differentiate familiar and novel conspecifics as expressed by habituation and recovery of scent marking, but neither C57 or CD-1 mice can differentiate new vs. familiar C57 males; likely due to similarities in their odor patterns. The data also indicate that scent marking can differentiate novel from familiar contexts."},{"method":"Experiments were performed using the dose of fentanyl (240 gamma\/kg; four injections of 60 gamma\/(ml kg) every 15 min, subcutaneously) for which secondary hyperalgesia has been previously described.","background":"The present study aimed to examine the effects of an acute administration of the mu-opioid receptor fentanyl on affect as assessed by place-conditioning procedure in rats. We determined the affective properties of fentanyl not only immediately following its administration, but also 24h later.","conclusion":"Our results show that the acute administration of fentanyl display biphasic affective properties, with early rewarding and 24-h delayed aversive components. The 24-h delayed aversive effects of fentanyl were not observed in animals submitted to a polyamine-deficient diet, suggesting an NMDA-dependent mechanism."},{"method":"Compared to non-stressed control rats, neonatally stressed rats and rats exposed to combined neonatal and juvenile stress, had reduced frequency and duration of social encounters, and lower anxiety levels. Juvenile stress alone, induced more frequent, but shorter social encounters in adulthood. No significant differences in aggressive behavior were found between any of the groups.","background":"The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that exposure to neonatal and\/or juvenile stress results in distinct persisting modification of adult male rats' emotional and social competence.","conclusion":"The findings confirm the existence of developmental time windows during which exposure to unpredictable stress can affect adult emotional and social behavior without affecting cognitive function."},{"method":"The protocol includes a shaping phase, in which the animals learn to dig up a reward, a preliminary training phase and a training phase, where the actual association is learned. Subsequently, mice are tested for transitive inference and subjected to a symmetry test.","background":"The APP23 model is a transgenic mouse model for Alzheimer's disease. Cognitive performance in the APP23-model was assessed by Morris Water Maze (MWM) and passive avoidance learning, but the latter failed to show any difference between the genotypes. In search of a non-spatial alternative for assessment of hippocampus-dependent memory, we evaluated an odour paired-associate test, which is based on learning an association between two sets of odours.","conclusion":"Impairment was seen in the APP23 mice, in comparison with wild type mice, in training; however, both groups failed the transitivity and symmetry test. Possible explanations for this discrepancy with earlier published results are the advanced age of the mice or the C57Bl\/6J background, in which the model was established."},{"method":"We have identified certain APP-expressing cultured cell lines that form low-n oligomers intracellularly and release a portion of them into the medium.","background":"During the last 25 years, neuropathological, biochemical, genetic, cell biological and even therapeutic studies in humans have all supported the hypothesis that the gradual cerebral accumulation of soluble and insoluble assemblies of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in limbic and association cortices triggers a cascade of biochemical and cellular alterations that produce the clinical phenotype of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The reasons for elevated cortical Abeta42 levels in most patients with typical, late-onset AD are unknown, but based on recent work, these could turn out to include augmented neuronal release of Abeta during some kinds of synaptic activity. Elevated levels of soluble Abeta42 monomers enable formation of soluble oligomers that can diffuse into synaptic clefts.","conclusion":"We find that these naturally secreted soluble oligomers--at picomolar concentrations--can disrupt hippocampal LTP in slices and in vivo and can also impair the memory of a complex learned behavior in rats. Abeta trimers appear to be more potent in disrupting LTP than are dimers. The cell-derived oligomers also decrease dendritic spine density in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, and this decrease can be prevented by administration of Abeta antibodies or small-molecule modulators of Abeta aggregation. This therapeutic progress has been accompanied by advances in imaging the Abeta deposits non-invasively in humans. A new diagnostic-therapeutic paradigm to successfully address AD and its harbinger, mild cognitive impairment-amnestic type, is emerging."},{"method":"Focusing on the motor system, I will discuss the cellular responses that occur after spinal cord injury and that illustrate distinct plastic events occurring at the lesion site as well as at other levels of the neuraxis. These plastic responses are not restricted to neuronal cells and to the formation of new circuitries, but can also be illustrated by the change of morphology, fate and biochemical properties of non-neuronal cells (i.e. astrocytes and neural precursor cells).","background":"The commonly accepted view of a highly rigid, hardwired central nervous system has evolved considerably over the past few decades. The adult central nervous system is now known to be capable of significant functional reorganization, frequently referred to as plasticity, in order to adapt to a changing environment or to a change in the CNS hardware itself, for example after trauma.","conclusion":"These cellular responses interact with one another and contribute, together, to the tissue remodeling and to the sparing or recovery of some motor functions. Understanding these cellular responses as well as their interrelations is necessary to find appropriate approaches to manipulate one with no detrimental effects to the others. This is a prerequisite for the development of new and effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of patients with CNS injuries."},{"method":"Therefore, in this study, C57BL\/6J mice were used to test the effects of withdrawal from chronic nicotine on foreground and background contextual fear conditioning, which present the context as a primary or secondary stimulus, respectively. Mice withdrawn from 12 days of chronic nicotine (6.3mg\/kg\/day) or saline were trained and tested in either foreground or background contextual fear conditioning; nicotine withdrawal-associated deficits in contextual fear conditioning were observed in both conditions. Mice were also tested for the effects of withdrawal on pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex (PPI), a measure of sensory gating, and on the acoustic startle reflex. Mice withdrawn from 12 days of chronic nicotine (6.3 or 12.6 mg\/kg\/day) or saline underwent one 30-min PPI and startle session; no effect of withdrawal from chronic nicotine on PPI or startle was observed for either dose at 24h after nicotine removal. Therefore, mice were tested at different time points following withdrawal from 12.6 mg\/kg\/day chronic nicotine (8, 24, and 48 h after nicotine removal).","background":"Nicotine withdrawal is associated with multiple symptoms such as anxiety, increased appetite, and disrupted cognition in humans. Although animal models have provided insights into the somatic and affective symptoms of nicotine withdrawal, less research has focused on the effects of nicotine withdrawal on cognition.","conclusion":"No effect of withdrawal from chronic nicotine was observed at any time point for PPI. Overall, these results demonstrate that nicotine withdrawal disrupts two methods of contextual learning but not sensory gating in C57BL\/6J mice."},{"method":"Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we mapped the corticomotor projection to the dominant flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECR) muscle before and after interventional sensory stimulation obtained via muscle tendon vibration (80Hz, 60 min) to the dominant distal wrist flexor tendons.","background":"The present experiment addressed whether increases in corticospinal excitability following sensory stimulation with muscle tendon vibration are accompanied by reorganization of the forearm musculature representation within the primary motor cortex.","conclusion":"Following vibration, MEP amplitude at the optimal stimulation position, motor output area, as well as map volume, increased significantly for the ECR. None of these effects reached significance for the FCR. These results suggest that the antagonistic vibratory response (AVR), which is considered to be of cortical origin, induces a delayed facilitation of musculature that is antagonistic to the site of the directly activated Ia afferent pathways. This example demonstrates that peripheral sensory stimulation can induce lasting increases in corticospinal excitability in the absence of actual movements."},{"method":"Sixty-three undergraduate students (30 men and 33 women) were randomly distributed into three testing conditions; they had to find 3, 5 and 7 rewards, respectively, in a virtual room with 16 possible rewarded positions. Subjects were asked to use the minimum amount of attempts to discover all the rewards in 10 trials. In the initial trial subjects needed to visit almost all the positions to discover the rewards.","background":"This study assesses the effectiveness of a new virtual task to evaluate human place learning. This test was based on the hole-board maze, developed for rodent research. Its design provides an easy set of levels of difficulty.","conclusion":"However, in the last trial an important percentage of subjects did not err. Results showed that all subjects acquired the task but with different amounts of mistakes directly related to the level of difficulty of the condition. In addition, women were slower and less accurate than men. These results agree with previous results in other virtual tasks, and support the spatial component of this test."},{"method":"Our study observed that ischemic pups engage in less time producing USVs and make fewer USVs overall, with male ischemic pups experiencing reductions in more categories than females.","background":"Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy results in a spectrum of pathologies related to the degree of initial infarct and environmental factors, including maternal interactions. Infants actively influence their environment by crying; rat pups produce ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs).","conclusion":"Future studies should consider whether alterations in mother-pup interactions result from these reductions."},{"method":"Rats were trained to discriminate horizontal and vertical lines that were either solid or composed of disjunct elements in which discrimination required perceptual grouping by proximity. Psychophysical procedures established the limits at which proximity served as a cue for grouping. Following perceptual measurements, ablations were made to selective sites within visual cortex.","background":"Neural mechanisms mediating perceptual grouping serve to enhance associations among stimulus elements, thereby establishing unified forms. The goals of the present study were to identify cortical areas necessary to perceptually group spatially isolated elements, and to determine if these areas are distinct from regions necessary for the discrimination of simple, solid forms.","conclusion":"Lesions within area 17 or area 18A, including their interface, produced nearly complete impairment of solid line discrimination as well as perceptual grouping at all levels of proximity, whereas lesions to areas 18 or the far lateral extent of area 18A no effect on these perceptual capacities. These results indicate that grouping by proximity requires early visual processing areas, and shares cortical areas necessary for simple pattern discrimination. These results suggest that mechanisms of grouping modify primary stimulus representations, constructing a pattern of activity functional similar to that elicited by solid forms."},{"method":"Genetically modified animals are a complementary approach to pharmacological studies for further investigations of the role of the 5-HT(1A)-receptor. Next to 5-HT(1A)-receptor knockout mice, two transgenic mouse lines exist that either overexpress the 5-HT(1A)-receptor transiently or permanently. The latter mouse line stands out due to the fact that a distinct overexpression is primarily found in the outer cortical layers and hippocampus, both projection areas of serotonergic neurons.","background":"The serotonin 1A (5-HT(1A))-receptor is involved in a wide range of physiological functions, but has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders and depression. Although the 5-HT(1A)-receptor is one of the best described receptor subtypes of the serotonergic system, its complex distribution pattern, pre- and postsynaptic localisation, and its impact on various neurotransmitters aggravate the attribution of 5-HT(1A)-agonistic effects to behavioural outcomes. The role of 5-HT(1A)-receptors for cognitive processes seems undisputed. However, the exact involvement of pre- and postsynaptic sites remains unexplained.","conclusion":"Here, we discuss the findings obtained from 5-HT(1A)-receptor knockout and overexpressing mice concerning their learning and memory abilities."},{"method":"Rats were allowed to explore the field in which two identical objects were presented. Then after a delay period, they were placed again in the same field in which one of the two objects was replaced by another object (object recognition task) or moved to another place (place recognition task), and their exploration behavior to these objects were analyzed. Activation of hippocampal cannabinoid receptors by an agonist WIN 55,212-2 (1-2 microg\/side) dose-dependently decreased the exploration of object in a new place, while it did not affect the exploration of a new object. Disruptive effect of WIN 55,212-2 on place recognition was antagonized by the pretreatment with a cannabinoid receptor antagonist AM 281 (2mg\/kg, i.p.).","background":"Involvement of hippocampal cannabinoid receptors in short-term memory was investigated in rats using spontaneous object and place recognition memory tasks.","conclusion":"Results suggest that hippocampal cannabinoid receptors play an important role in place recognition or spatial memory."},{"method":"We examined c-fos expression in lactating rats whose pups were removed for 4h to increase mothers' anxiety, or not removed to maintain low anxiety in mothers, followed by exposure to the anxiogenic stimuli of either brief handling or handling followed by exposure to an elevated plus maze. Control animals had their litters removed or not, but no further stimulation. A large number of neural sites traditionally implicated in regulating anxiety in male rats were examined, and similar to what is found in male rats, most showed increased Fos expression after handling and\/or elevated plus-maze exposure.","background":"The postpartum period is associated with many behavioral changes, including a reduction in anxiety, which is thought to be necessary for mothers' ability to appropriately care for infants. In laboratory rats, this reduction in anxiety requires recent contact with pups, but areas of the brain where infant contact influences neural activity to reduce anxiety are mostly unknown.","conclusion":"Litter presence before testing affected Fos expression due to handling or elevated plus-maze exposure only in the ventral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, dorsal and ventral preoptic area, ventromedial hypothalamus, lateral habenula, and supramammillary nucleus. Contrary to expectations, prior litter presence was associated with more Fos expression in most of these sites after handling and\/or elevated plus-maze stimulation, and only after such stimulation. These sites may be of particular importance for how sensory inputs from infants modulate anxiety and other mood states during the postpartum period."},{"method":"We summarize recent experimental data documenting pronounced dendritic remodeling of pyramidal cells and suppressed gliogenesis in the mPFC of rats subjected to chronic stress or to artificially elevated glucocorticoid levels.","background":"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in a number of higher cognitive functions as well as processing emotions and regulation of stress responses. Hemispheric specialization of the PFC in humans in emotional processing is well documented, and there is evidence that a similar functional lateralization is present in all mammals. Recent findings suggest the possibility of an intrinsic structural hemispheric asymmetry in the rat medial PFC (mPFC). Specifically, interhemispheric differences have been found in the architecture of pyramidal cell apical dendritic trees together with hemispheric asymmetry in cell proliferation including gliogenesis. It is now well established that chronic stress has a profound impact on neural plasticity in a number of corticolimbic structures and affects the etiology, pathophysiology, and therapeutic outcome of most psychiatric disorders.","conclusion":"The stress affect on these structural elements seems to be hemispheric specific, often abolishing or even reversing natural asymmetries seen at the cellular level. We discuss these preclinical observations with respect to clinical findings that show impaired function, altered lateralization and histopathological changes in the PFC in psychiatric patients. We argue that it is important to define the kinds of structural changes that result from long-term stress exposure because this knowledge will improve the identification of cellular endophenotypes in various psychiatric disorders."},{"method":"Here we show that the mean theta rhythm speed observed during baseline periods of immobility has a strong positive correlation with the rate at which rats learn an operant task.","background":"Many lines of evidence indicate that theta rhythm, a prominent neural oscillatory mode found in the mammalian hippocampus, plays a key role in the acquisition, processing, and retrieval of memories. However, a predictive neurophysiological feature of the baseline theta rhythm that correlates with the learning rate across different animals has yet to be identified.","conclusion":"This relationship is observed across rats, during both quiet waking (r=0.82; p&lt;0.01) and paradoxical sleep (r=0.83; p&lt;0.01), suggesting that the basal theta frequency relates to basic neurological processes that are important in the acquisition of operant behavior."},{"method":"Our study therefore examines two novel trishomocubane compounds, N-(3'-fluorophenyl)methyl-4-azahexacyclo[5.4.1.0(2,6).0(3,10).0(5,9).0(8,11)]dodecan-3-ol (1) and, N-(3'-fluorophenyl)ethyl-4-azahexacyclo[5.4.1.0(2,6).0(3,10).0(5,9).0(8,11)]dodecan-3-ol (2) in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of Parkinson's disease. A variety of motor behaviours were studied in rats given 6-OHDA lesions. Groups of lesioned rats were given either (1) or (2) or vehicle solution i.p.","background":"Whilst dopamine replacement improves cardinal features of Parkinson's disease, chronic levodopa administration is associated with dose-related side effects and not all symptoms are ameliorated, necessitating the development of new treatments. Studies of trishomocubanes, a novel group of sigma ligands, have shown enhanced amphetamine-stimulated striatal release of dopamine and a potentially neuroprotective action in vitro and reversal of reserpine-induced catalepsy in vivo. Such effects warrant investigation in animal models of parkinsonism.","conclusion":"Acute administration of 3 mg\/kg (1) resulted in a decrease in locomotor activity. Twenty-five milligrams per kilogram (2) caused a decrease in locomotor activity at t=10 and t=20 min of the locomotor test but this was not found when (2) was co-administered with either apomorphine or amphetamine. The decreased locomotor activity indicates that (1) and (2) may have sedative\/anxiolytic effect(s). However, elevated plus maze data failed to demonstrate anxiolysis with (2). Quantification of dopaminergic neurons did not demonstrate any significant difference in the magnitude of cell loss between drug-treated vs. vehicle treated rats so no neuroprotective effect was demonstrated in this model at the doses utilised."},{"method":"When the birds had learned the discrimination, entopallium or hippocampus was damaged by ibotenic acid injection.","background":"We compared the effect of entopallial lesions with that of hippocampal lesions on pattern discrimination in zebra finches. The birds were trained to discriminate a feeder with a dot pattern from feeders with a stripe pattern, all located at the floor of a small aviary.","conclusion":"Entopallial lesions caused deficits in the discrimination, while hippocampal lesions did not. As shown in previous experiments using the same experimental design with feeders of one colour and without distinct pattern [Watanabe S, Bischof HJ. Effects of hippocampal lesions on acquisition and retention of spatial learning in zebra finches. Behav Brain Res 2004;155:147-52], hippocampal lesions cause strong deficits in spatial orientation. Taken together, our experiments prove that the avian hippocampus is involved in spatial learning, but not in pattern discrimination tasks."},{"method":"In this study, we investigated possible specific astrocyte alterations in the hippocampi of Wistar rats submitted to nbm damage with ibotenic acid, investigating the content and immunohistochemistry of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), as well as S100B protein content, glutamate uptake and glutamine synthetase activity on the 7th and 28th post-lesion days. Cognitive deficit was confirmed by the step-down inhibitory avoidance task.","background":"Lesion of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nbm) is a suitable approach to study cognitive deficit and behavior alterations involving cholinergic dysfunction, which is associated with the major types of dementia. Cortical astrogliosis also has been described in this model, but it is not clear whether hippocampal astrocytes are activated.","conclusion":"Interestingly, we found a decrease in GFAP content, S100B content and glutamate uptake activity in the hippocampus on the 28th day after nbm lesion. No alterations were observed in glutamine synthetase activity or in the cerebrospinal fluid S100B content. Although our data suggest caution in the use of nbm lesion with ibotenic acid as a dementia model, it is possible that these alterations could contribute to the cognitive deficit observed in these rats."},{"method":"In the present study, we used mice with constitutive knock-out of fosB in order to study fosB role in mouse phenotype. We studied rewarding properties of morphine (10mg\/kg i.p.) in conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. Additionally, we studied fosB role in spatial memory and spatial working memory using elevated plus maze model of spatial learning (EPMSL) and delayed non-match to place task (DNMTP). In further studies, locomotor, depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviours were measured.","background":"The immediate early genes (IEGs) have been suggested to be implicated in mechanisms of addiction, as well as in learning and memory processes. fosB, which belongs to IEG, has been reported to have pleiotropic impact on response to psychoactive drugs, as well as motivational and stress-related behaviours.","conclusion":"Rewarding effects of morphine in fosB -\/- mice were abolished whereas spatial learning was impaired. On the other hand, we found no significant differences in locomotor activity, depression-like and anxiety-like behaviours. In summary, our results indicate that mice lacking fosB are less sensitive to rewarding properties of morphine and display spatial memory impairment and suggest involvement of fosB and its proteins in motivational aspects of reinforcers as well as in learning and memory processes."},{"method":"Accordingly, in this inaugural paper, using hemalun-phloxin staining and NeuN immunohistochemistry, the number of damaged and residual healthy neurons was quantified in the amygdala in mice over a 90-day period after soman injection (1.2LD(50) of soman).","background":"To date, studies on soman-induced neuropathology mainly focused on the hippocampus, since this brain region is a well-delimited area with easily detectable pyramidal neurons. Moreover, the hippocampus is severely damaged after soman exposure leading to a substantial alteration of behavioral mnemonic processes. The neuropathology described in the hippocampus, however, and its behavioral consequences cannot be extrapolated to all other limbic damaged brain areas such as the amygdala.","conclusion":"On post-soman day 1, a moderate neuronal cell death (about 23% of the whole neurons) was evidenced. In parallel, a large quantity of degenerating neurons (about 36% of the whole neurons) occurred in this brain region and survived from post-soman day 1 to day 15. The death of these damaged neurons was initiated on post-soman day 30, and ended on post-soman day 90. Concomitantly, as quantified by NeuN immunohistochemistry, a clear neuronal regeneration was demonstrated in the amygdala of soman-poisoned mice between 60 and 90 days after neurotoxicant exposure. In the companion paper (see part 2), the possible effects of both long-term neuropathology and delayed neuronal regeneration were evaluated on amygdala-driven emotional processes."},{"method":"Pain-related behavior was compared between four relevant mouse strains (C57BL\/6J, 129S6\/SvEv, B6 129 F1 and NMRI mice of both sexes) using an extended test battery that included an unusual variety of assays for thermal and mechanical acute nociception, and inflammatory and neuropathic pain.","background":"The interpretation of knockout and transgenic mouse studies in pain research critically depends on detailed knowledge of the performance profile of the background strains.","conclusion":"Strain- and gender-dependent differences were demonstrated in many of these nociceptive assays. Particularly, C57BL and 129 mice, which serve as the default genetic backgrounds for experiments in genetically altered mice, display quite different patterns of nociceptive performance. Compared to C57BL\/6J mice, 129S6\/SvEv animals are less sensitive to inflammatory pain conditions (thermal sensitivity after carrageenan subplantar injection; flinch behavior after formalin injection), while the opposite is observed in the neuropathic pain condition and the visceral pain model. These data may be of special interest for genetic studies, where issues related to the background phenotype may confound their interpretation."},{"method":"Intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid beta protein fragment 25-35 [Abeta(25-35)] induced impairment of learning and memory in a Y-maze, novel object recognition and contextual fear conditioning tests. Either donepezil or selegiline alone improved the cognitive impairments in the Y-maze and conditioned fear learning tasks in Abeta(25-35)-injected mice, whereas donepezil, but not selegiline, failed to improve the impairment in a novel object recognition task. Co-administration of donepezil with selegiline, at doses that do not exert efficacy individually, significantly improved the deficits in all three tests, indicating a synergistic cognition-improving effect. These alleviating effects were antagonized by pretreatment with a muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine and a dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol.","background":"Selegiline, an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, has been demonstrated to have a potential cognition-improving effect in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) undergoing treatment with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil. To confirm such clinical events, we investigated whether co-administration of donepezil with selegiline had a synergistic cognition-improving effect in an animal model of AD.","conclusion":"These results suggest that selegiline potentiates the effect of donepezil on the cognitive impairment, and that the synergistic effect may be mediated through both the cholinergic and dopaminergic systems."},{"method":"In the present study, ERPs were recorded while subjects processed different offers of a proposer. In addition to clearly fair and unfair offers, mid-value offers which cannot be easily classified as fair or unfair and therefore involve more elaborate decision making were analyzed.","background":"In the Ultimatum Game, participants typically reject monetary offers they consider unfair even if the alternative is to gain no money at all.","conclusion":"A fast initial distinction between fair and other kinds of offers was reflected by amplitude of the feedback related negativity (FRN). Mid-value offers were associated with longer RTs, and a larger N350 amplitude. In addition, source analyses revealed a specific involvement of the superior temporal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule during processing of mid-value offers compared to offers categorized clearly as fair or unfair, suggesting a contribution of mentalizing about the intention of the proposer to the decision making process. Taken together, the present findings support the idea that economic decisions are significantly affected by non-rational factors, trying to narrow the gap between formal theory and the real decisional behaviour."},{"method":"Developing mouse fetuses were exposed in utero during gestational days 8-18 by giving pregnant C57Bl\/6J female mice food containing MeHg at a daily dose of 0.01 mg\/kg body weight.","background":"Methylmercury (MeHg) has cytotoxic effects on animals and humans, and a major target organ for MeHg is the central nervous system (CNS). It is well known that the developing CNS is extremely vulnerable to MeHg-induced changes in comparison to the mature brain. Most studies have concentrated on the direct effects of high levels of prenatal MeHg exposure. Surprisingly, behavioral outcomes found in adult offspring exposed developmentally to the neurotoxic effects of chronic, low-dose mercury more akin to ingestion in humans are not well characterized. The objective of this study was to determine whether such exposure produces deleterious effects on behavior in adult mice, including motor\/coordination abilities, overall activity and mnemonic function.","conclusion":"Adult mice prenatally exposed to MeHg exhibited significant deficits in motor abilities, coordination, and overall activity, as measured by rotarod, footprint analysis and open field. In addition, MeHg-exposed mice were impaired with respect to reference memory but not in a visible, cued version of the Morris water maze task. These results indicate that prenatal exposure to the lowest dose of MeHg examined to date can have long-lasting motor and cognitive consequences on adult offspring. These findings have far reaching implications related to putative safe levels of MeHg ingestion, particularly during pregnancy, and increasing rates of cognitive and psychological disorders (e.g. attention hyperactivity deficit disorder, autism) in our society."},{"method":"Rats in different groups were administered injections in five 3-day blocks: Paired, AMPH (1.0mg\/kg, IP) in locomotor activity boxes on day 1 and saline in their home cages on day 2; Unpaired, saline in the activity boxes on day 1 and AMPH in their home cages on day 2; or Control, saline in both environments. No injections were administered on day 3 of each block. One week after the last conditioning block, all rats were tested for their conditioned locomotor response in the activity boxes for 1h following an IP saline injection. In Paired rats, this injection was preceded by a bilateral microinjection into the NAcc of saline, the group I mGluR antagonist, AIDA (0.5, 5.0 nmol\/side), or the group II mGluR antagonist, EGLU (0.5, 5.0 nmol\/side). Unpaired and Control rats received NAcc saline.","background":"Environmental stimuli associated with amphetamine (AMPH) can elicit conditioned locomotion in rats, and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is known to be important in this process.

However, the expression of this conditioned hyper-locomotion was dose-dependently inhibited by NAcc EGLU, but not by AIDA. These results suggest that activation of group II, but not of group I, mGluRs in the NAcc contributes to the expression of conditioned locomotion in an environment associated with amphetamine."},{"method":"To address these issues, we measured fear expressed with conditioned defecation as well as behavior, and used a trace cued learning paradigm. Using the platform-over-water method, male Sprague-Dawley rats were continuously sleep-deprived for 3 days, or for 20 h\/day for 3 days. Animals then underwent fear conditioning, and were tested for learning the next day.","background":"Reduced sleep interferes with contextual but not cued learned fear, and it was suggested that this selectivity reflects underlying neural substrates. The apparent lack of contextual fear in sleep-deprived animals, however, could be secondary to hyperactivity. Also, changing the parameters of cued conditioning can change the neural pathways involved, such that some types of cued fear might be sensitive to sleep loss.","conclusion":"Sleep-deprived or -restricted animals showed a lack of contextual fear at testing, as conditioned freezing and defecation were minimal. Sleep deprivation also blocked cued fear after trace conditioning. Therefore, reduced sleep impairs contextual learning, and impairs cued learning only when the hippocampus is involved. The data support a model in which sleep loss interferes with hippocampal function while sparing amygdala function."},{"method":"We also reported the outcome of an empirical investigation of the impact of wheel running exercise on the expression of both cognitive and non-cognitive phenotypes in a triple (3 x Tg-AD) transgenic mouse model for Alzheimer's disease (AD).","background":"There is growing interest in the effects of voluntary wheel running activity on brain and behaviour in laboratory rodents and their implications to humans. Here, the major findings to date on the impact of exercise on mental health and diseases as well as the possible underlying neurobiological mechanisms are summarised. Several critical modulating factors on the neurobehavioural effects of wheel running exercise are emphasized and discussed--including the amount of wheel running, sex and strain\/species differences.","conclusion":"Clear sex- and paradigm-specific effects of exercise on the genetically determined phenotypes are illustrated, including the efficacy of wheel running activity in attenuating the sex-specific cognitive deficits.

The repetitive behavior domain encompasses abnormal motoric stereotypy, an inflexible insistence on sameness, and resistance to change. In recent years, many genetic mouse models of autism and related disorders have been developed, based on candidate genes for disease susceptibility. The present studies are part of an ongoing initiative to develop appropriate behavioral tasks for the evaluation of mouse models relevant to autism.

This study investigated the individual and co-operative involvement of ERalpha and beta on sexual behaviors in the adult female rat.","conclusion":"The ERalpha agonist PPT, but not the ERbeta agonist DPN, elicited both proceptive and receptive behavior. PPT at doses of 2.5 and 5.0mg significantly elicited lordosis and proceptive behavior ('ear wiggling', hopping and darting). Intriguingly, the administration of both agonists together at the 2.5mg dose resulted in reduced levels of proceptivity and receptivity, suggesting that ERbeta modulates ERalpha's ability to elicit receptive and proceptive sexual behavior."},{"method":"In order to analyze the influences of the genetic background on the transgene expression, we studied the effects of the hAPPswe transgene involved in Alzheimer's Amyloid Pathology, in 3 genetic backgrounds differing by their genetic heterogeneity (homozygous vs heterozygous) and the strain of origin (C57BL6, CBA, B6SJL F1) after only one generation backcrossing. Three different behavioral paradigms were used to assess the psychological and cognitive phenotypic differences: elevated plus maze, morris navigation task and contextual fear conditioning.","background":"Animal models of genetic diseases obtained by transferring human mutated genes in the mouse are widely used in biomedical based research. They constitute efficient tools to study mechanisms underlying abnormal phenotypes. Unfortunately, the phenotype of the transgene is often obscured by the genetic background of the embryonic stem cells and that of the recipient strain used to create the transgenic line. It is also known, from the literature, that repeatedly backcrossing a transgenic strain to an inbred background may have unfavorable effects that can result in the loss of the transgenic line.","conclusion":"Our data indicate that the best solution to maintain the transgenic line is to backcross repeatedly the transgenic mice into the F1 hybrid cross that was used to create the transgenic strain, whereas phenotyping should be performed comparatively after only one generation backcrossing into various well chosen F1 or inbred backgrounds."},{"method":"Female hooded-Lister rats received vehicle (n=36; intraperitoneal (i.p.)) or PCP (n=22; 2mg\/kg, i.p.) twice daily for 7 days, followed by a 7-day washout period.

In a second experiment, PCP-treated rats were treated acutely with either fluoxetine (2.5mg\/kg, i.p.) or chlordiazepoxide (CDP) (2.5mg\/kg, i.p.) all 30 min prior to testing. For the test, pairs of unfamiliar rats receiving acute doses of drugs described above were placed in the test arena and social behaviours (following, sniffing, climbing over and under, exploration of inanimate object and avoiding) were recorded on video for subsequent blind scoring.","background":"We have recently shown that sub-chronic phencyclidine (PCP) treatment produces social behaviour deficits in female rats which are reversed by ziprasidone but not haloperidol or clozapine. This investigation was designed to extend the previous findings and identify the role of 5-HT(1A) receptors in mediating the effects of these drugs in this model.","conclusion":"The results showed that PCP-induced deficits in social behaviours were reversed by acute treatment with both aripiprazole and fluoxetine but not CDP or WAY100635. Furthermore, pre-treatment with WAY100635 prevented the reversal of social behaviour deficits observed with aripiprazole. These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of drugs such as aripiprazole and fluoxetine on PCP-induced social behaviour deficits, a potential model of negative symptoms of schizophrenia, may be a consequence of modifications of the serotonergic system, in particular through an interaction with 5-HT(1A) receptors."},{"method":"In the present study, we examined estradiol's ability to decrease the actions of two additional orexigenic peptides, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP). Food intake was monitored following lateral ventricular infusions of 5 microg NPY, 10 microg AgRP, or saline vehicle in ovariectomized rats treated with either 1 microg estradiol or sesame oil vehicle.","background":"Available data suggest that estradiol exerts an inhibitory effect on food intake by modulating the actions of multiple gut- and brain-derived peptides implicated in the control of food intake. For example, recent studies have shown that estradiol decreases the orexigenic effects of ghrelin and melanin-concentrating hormone.","conclusion":"NPY increased food intake for 2h in both oil- and estradiol-treated ovariectomized rats. During this interval, the orexigenic effect of NPY was significantly greater in oil-treated rats, relative to estradiol-treated rats. In contrast to the short-term action of NPY, a single injection of AgRP increased food intake for 3 days in oil- and estradiol-treated rats. Meal pattern analysis revealed that the orexigenic effect of AgRP is mediated by an increase in meal size, not meal number. Unlike that observed following NPY treatment, estradiol failed to modulate the magnitude by which AgRP increased food intake and meal size. We conclude that a physiological regimen of estradiol treatment decreases the orexigenic effect of NPY, but not AgRP, in ovariectomized rats."},{"method":"Rat dams and their offspring were subjected to one of five dietary regimens: control, CR50% for 3 days preconception, CR25% during gestation, CR25% during lactation, and CR25% during gestation, lactation, and post-weaning (lifelong). The pup retrieval test and maternal observations were conducted during lactation to quantify maternal care. In the pup retrieval test, dams that were concurrently experiencing CR (i.e., from the lactation and lifelong groups) displayed shorter latencies to retrieve all pups than the control and preconception groups and the lactation group constructed better nests than all groups. Adult offspring were tested in three tests of anxiety: the elevated plus maze, open field, and emergence test.","background":"Environmental stimuli such as caloric availability during the perinatal period exert a profound influence on the development of an organism. Studies in this domain have focused on the effects of under- and malnutrition while the effects of more mild levels of restriction have not been delineated.","conclusion":"No differences were observed in the elevated plus maze; however, in the open field preconception animals made fewer entries and spent more time in the central zone than controls. In addition, preconception offspring exhibited longer latencies to full body emergence, spent less time fully emerged, and spent more time engaged in risk assessment behaviours than all other groups. Offspring from the preconception group were also on average 11% heavier than control rats throughout life and displayed 37% higher serum leptin concentrations than controls.

In the conventional CTA, the subject learns to associate a tastant (the conditioned stimulus, CS) with delayed toxicosis (an unconditioned stimulus, UCS) to yield taste aversion (the conditioned response, CR). However, the association of taste with delayed negative internal states that could generate CRs that are different from taste aversion should not be neglected. Such associations may contribute to the ontogenesis, reinforcement and symptoms of some types of taste- and food-related disorders.","conclusion":"This is hence a learned situation in which food and company do not mix well."},{"method":"However, lateralized response properties were detected.","background":"The response properties of 48 right (n=24) and left (n=24) hippocampal formation (HF) cells were examined by recording from freely moving homing pigeons as they foraged in an open-field environment with unstable goal locations.

By contrast, left HF cells maintained firing rates throughout sessions and displayed modestly higher reliability scores compared to right HF neurons. Notable was one striking group of cells (n=13), predominantly found in the right HF, that displayed rate maps characterized by numerous, discrete areas of above baseline firing rates, overall very low firing rates and higher specificity than other cells recorded in this study. Overall, the data emphasize the importance of stable goal locations in shaping the spatial response profile of homing pigeon HF neurons and demonstrate the persistence of lateralized response properties under conditions when space explains little of the temporal variation in firing rate."},{"method":"The 5-HT7 receptor ligands were microinjected directly into the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) during the light period of the 12-h light\/12-h dark cycle.","background":"The effects of LP-44, a selective 5-HT7 receptor agonist, and of SB-269970, a selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, on spontaneous sleep were studied in adult rats implanted for chronic sleep recordings.","conclusion":"Infusion of LP-44 (1.25-5.0 mM) into the DRN induced a significant reduction of rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) and of the number of REM periods. Similar effects were observed after the direct administration into the DRN of SB-269970 (0.5-1.0 mM). Pretreatment with a dose of SB-269970 (0.5 mM) that significantly affects sleep variables antagonized the LP-44 (2.5 mM)-induced suppression of REMS and of the number of REM periods. It is proposed that the suppression of REMS after microinjection of LP-44 into the DRN is related, at least in part, to the activation of GABAergic neurons in the DRN that contribute to long projections that reach, among others, the laterodorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei involved in the promotion of REMS."},{"method":"Using homologous recombination (knock-in) techniques we targeted two phosphorylation sites on the AMPA-GluR1 receptor: the CaMKII\/PKC Ser 831 site and the PKA Ser 845 site.

The regulation of AMPA receptors occurs through trafficking of the receptor and\/or modulation of the receptor's channel properties and both of these processes depend on phosphorylation of the receptor.","conclusion":"We report that, whereas WT mice showed enhanced responding for the reward-associated cue, mice with mutations of both phosphorylation sites or the Ser 831 site alone, failed to show such a conditioned reinforcement effect. By contrast, mice with only the Ser 845 site deficient showed normal CS+ reinforced responding. Thus, action at the Ser 831 phosphorylation site was necessary for normal conditioned reinforcement. Finally, the behavioral deficit was highly specific: performance on a number of other measures of motivated performance, including responding reinforced by the food itself, was unaffected by the mutations. Our findings provide novel evidence for a molecular mechanism in a form of appetitive incentive learning critical in regulating normal motivated behavior, as well as maladaptive forms such as addiction and eating disorders."},{"method":"The emotional behavior was estimated in animal tests of unconditioned fear (light\/dark boxes, elevated plus-maze) and conditioned fear (auditory and contextual response).","background":"The organophosphorus compound soman produces long-lasting epileptic seizure activity which is associated to brain damage, more particularly in the hippocampus and the amygdala.

The present paper examines the long-term effects of soman poisoning on emotional reactivity in mice, 30 or 90 days after intoxication using behavioral tasks involving amygdala function.","conclusion":"In the light\/dark boxes and elevated plus-maze, mice intoxicated with soman (110 microg\/kg, 1.2 LD(50)) showed an anxiety-like behavior profile at post-poisoning days 30 and 90. In conditioned fear, results showed that both auditory and contextual conditioned responses are increased on post-soman day 30 but no longer on post-soman day 90, evidencing behavioral recovery overtime.

Tones were presented during the first and last 2s of the delay to reinforcement. The tone frequency predicted the magnitude of sucrose reinforcement in baseline conditions. All groups acquired stable preference for the lever on the large (150 microl) reinforcer side. However, nose poking during the delay to large reinforcement was highly accurate (i.e., to the reinforced side) for all groups except the rats with BLA lesions induced before training, suggesting impaired control of behavior by the tone. After the acquisition of stable preference, the locations of the reinforcer magnitudes were unpredictably reversed for a single session. Pre-training lesions blunted changes in preference when the reinforcer magnitudes were reversed. Lesions induced after stable preference was acquired, but prior to reversal, did not disrupt changes in preference.","background":"Previous studies show that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is required for behavior to adjust when the value of a reinforcer decreases after satiation or pairing with gastric distress. This study evaluated the effect of pre- or post-training excitotoxic lesions of the BLA on changes in preference with another type of contingency change, reinforcer magnitude reversal.","conclusion":"The data suggest that the BLA contributes to the adaptation of choice behavior following changes in reinforcer magnitude. Impaired learning about the tone-reinforcer magnitude relationships may have disrupted discrimination of the reinforcer magnitude reversal."},{"method":"Using automated behavioral analysis software (EthoVision), we quantified struggling during restraint.","background":"Restraint elicits a number of physiological stress responses that can be increased or decreased in magnitude based on prior stress history. For instance, repeated exposure to restraint leads to habituation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activation to restraint. In contrast, acute restraint after a different repeated stressor leads to facilitation of HPA activity to the novel stress. Acute restraint also elicits a variety of behaviors, including struggling, but the effect of prior stress in regulating behavioral responses to restraint is not clear. The goal of the present studies was to assess struggling during restraint with or without a prior history of repeated stress.","conclusion":"We found that acutely restrained rats exhibited vigorous struggling behavior that declined during a single restraint period. Repeated restraint lead to habituated struggling behavior, whereas acute restraint after repeated swim elicited facilitated struggling behavior. These effects on struggling were found alongside expected differences in HPA activity. Removing stress-induced increases in corticosterone via adrenalectomy did not significantly affect struggling responses to restraint. Overall, restraint-induced struggling appears to be regulated in a manner similar to HPA responses to restraint, but is not dictated by adrenal hormones."},{"method":"Rat pups were exposed to different combinations of EH and MS from postnatal day (PND) 2 to 10 using a split-litter design.

Current evidence suggests that, compared to non-handled rats, EH reduces hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) reactivity in the adult offspring through stimulating increased levels of active maternal care. In contrast, despite a similar increase in active maternal care, MS does not reduce HPA reactivity, thus suggesting that long mother-offspring separations may counteract the effects of increased active maternal care. We therefore attempted to selectively manipulate levels of active maternal care and durations of mother-offspring separations in neonate rats.","conclusion":"Low levels of maternal care combined with long mother-offspring separations increased HPA-reactivity compared to both high maternal care combined with long mother-offspring separations and low maternal care combined with brief separations. These findings further support the hypothesis that active maternal care and long mother-offspring separation act independently, and exert opposing effects, on adult offspring's HPA responses, but that increased maternal care may buffer the adverse consequences of long separations."},{"method":"The present experiments using rats examined effects of the mGlu5-antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP)--applied systemically i.p.

Reduced exploratory locomotion and exploration time after i.p. injections may have contributed to the observed retention impairments.

In addition, APP generates the APP-C31 and Jcasp toxic fragments intracellularly by cleavage at Asp664. We reported that mutation of Asp664 to Ala in a FAD-human APP transgene prevented AD-like deficits but did not affect Abeta production or deposition in PDAPP mice, arguing that D664A plays a crucial role in the generation of AD-like deficits. Whether D664A simply delays or completely prevents AD-like deficits, however, remained undefined.","conclusion":"While behavioral deficits were present in PDAPP mice, performance of Tg PDAPP(D664A) mice was not significantly different from non-Tg littermates' across all ages tested. Moreover, aberrant patterns in non-cognitive components of behavior in PDAPP mice were ameliorated in PDAPP(D664A) animals as well. A trend towards poorer retention at 9 mo and poorer learning at 13 mo that did not reach statistical significance was observed in PDAPP(D664A) mice. These results support and extend recent studies showing that cleavage of APP at Asp664 (or protein-protein interactions dependent on Asp664) is a crucial event in the generation of AD-like deficits in PDAPP mice. Our results thus further demonstrate that the D664A mutation either completely precludes, or markedly delays (beyond 13 mo) the appearance of AD-like deficits in this mouse model of AD."},{"method":"Here, using mice with a null mutation in LDLR (LDLR-\/-), we investigated whether the absence of LDLR affects a series of behavioral functions.

However, LDLR-\/- mice exhibited increased locomotor activity in an open field test without evidence of altered anxiety in either an open field or a light\/dark emergence test. By contrast, modulating dietary cholesterol produced only isolated effects. While both C57BL\/6J and LDLR-\/- mice fed a high cholesterol diet showed increased anxiety in a light\/dark task, and LDLR-\/- mice fed a high cholesterol diet exhibited longer target latencies in the probe trial of the Morris water maze, no other findings supported a general effect of cholesterol on anxiety or spatial memory. Collectively these studies suggest that while LDLR-\/- mice exhibit no major developmental defects, LDLR nevertheless plays a significant role in modulating locomotor behavior in the adult."},{"method":"The escalating amphetamine administration schedule consisted of three injections per day over a 6-day period with the dosage ranging from 1 to 8 mg\/kg.","background":"Based on the 'endogenous dopamine sensitization' hypothesis of schizophrenia the present study employed a repeated amphetamine administration regime in order to investigate the behavioral, neurochemical and neuroanatomical consequences following short- and long-term withdrawal periods.","conclusion":"It was demonstrated that following both short- (4 days) and long-term (66 days) withdrawal periods latent inhibition (LI) and prepulse inhibition (PPI), two translational paradigms highly relevant to schizophrenia, were disrupted. A challenge injection verified sensitization in two different cohorts of animals at 40 and 70 days following cessation of treatment. Neurochemical evaluation demonstrated a reduction in dopamine levels in the caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens core and shell as well as an enhanced utilization ratio in the caudate-putamen after both withdrawal periods. Similar to the findings from post-mortem studies of brains of schizophrenic patients, a downregulation of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) immunoreactivity was found in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, thalamus, and amygdala in amphetamine pretreated animals following longer withdrawal periods. This was not accompanied by enhanced neurotoxicity or reactive gliosis as demonstrated by the immunohistological analysis using the apoptotic marker activated Caspase-3 and GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein; a marker for astrocytes) following both short- and long-term withdrawal periods.

Similar behavioral profiles and habituation were observed in ischemic animals when exposed to repetitive open-field tests at days 3, 6, and 9 following reperfusion. CA1 neuronal injury (approximately 75% as compared to sham rats) was comparable in all ischemic groups at day 12 following reperfusion. The present findings suggest that differences in initial behavioral reactivity of sham and ischemic rats to bright versus dimly lighted environments may contribute to differences in open-field exploration reported between these groups. They also challenge the notion that deficits in exploration in ischemic animals are mainly attributable to processes related to habituation, or that hyperactivity represents a reliable predictor of CA1 neuronal injury.

This enhanced action of phencyclidine is likely to be mediated by the absence of serotonin-mediated behavioural inhibition in the hippocampus, leaving the psychostimulant effects of phencyclidine unopposed. Taken together with previous studies in rats, these studies in mice suggest that serotonin release in the dorsal hippocampus constitutes a behavioural inhibitory pathway normally involved in dampening excessive behavioural stimulation.

Under baseline conditions, new spines in the barrel cortex were mostly transient and rarely survived for more than a week. However, when every other whisker was trimmed, the generation and loss of persistent spines was enhanced. Ultrastructural reconstruction of previously imaged spines and boutons showed that new spines slowly form synapses. New spines persisting for a few days always had synapses, whereas very young spines often lacked synapses. New synapses were predominantly found on large, multi-synapse boutons, suggesting that spine growth is followed by synapse formation, preferentially on existing boutons.","background":"The functionality of adult neocortical circuits can be altered by novel experiences or learning. This functional plasticity appears to rely on changes in the strength of neuronal connections that were established during development. Here we will describe some of our studies in which we have addressed whether structural changes, including the remodeling of axons and dendrites with synapse formation and elimination, could underlie experience-dependent plasticity in the adult neocortex.","conclusion":"Altogether our data indicate that novel sensory experience drives the stabilization of new spines on subclasses of cortical neurons and promotes the formation of new synapses. These synaptic changes likely underlie experience-dependent functional remodeling of specific neocortical circuits."},{"method":"To accomplish this, we created a novel search task using a standard operant box fitted with a touch-sensitive computer monitor. Subjects were required to locate an S+ \"hidden\" amongst other identical stimuli on the monitor. In two versions of the task the S+ stayed in the same location within a session but shifted location between sessions. In a third version of the task the S+ was moved to a new location after every 10 trials.","background":"It has been repeatedly demonstrated across species that the hippocampus is critical for spatial learning and memory. Consequently, numerous paradigms have been created to study spatial learning in the rodent. Most of these tasks, such as the Morris water maze, 8-arm radial maze, and T-maze, are non-automated procedures. It was our goal to create an automated task in the rodent that is quickly learned, hippocampal-dependent, and minimizes the confounding variables present in most tests measuring hippocampal-dependent learning and memory.","conclusion":"It was found that the location of the S+ was quickly acquired each day (within 10 trials), and that the hippocampal-lesion group was impaired when compared to their control cohort. With the benefits inherent in automation, these tasks confer significant advantages over traditional tasks used to study spatial learning and memory in the rodent. When combined with previously developed non-spatial cognitive tests that can also be run in the touch-screen apparatus, the result is a powerful cognitive test battery for the rodent."},{"method":"Groups of male Swiss mice were subjected to different lengths of social stress exposure (social confrontation) which varied from 1 up to 13 days. As a biological stressor, 10(9) sheep red blood cells (SRBC)\/mL were injected by intraperitoneal route. As controls, animals not subjected to social stress and\/or injected with vehicle solution were used. The serum samples and the cerebral cortex were collected at 4 h, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 days after the end of social confrontation.","background":"The exposure to different kinds of stress impacts on the reactive oxygen species production with potential risk to the integrity of the tissues. Psychological or biological stress is responsible for a significant increase in the oxidative stress markers and also for activation of the antioxidant defense system. In this study, we analyzed the relationships between social stress, humoral immune response and glutathione-related antioxidant defenses.","conclusion":"The results indicated that the antioxidant enzymes activities were affected by psychological as well as by biological stressor. These alterations were dependent on the timing of stress exposure which resulted in a positive or in a negative correlation between the antibody titres to SRBC and antioxidant enzymes. We also discuss the possible role of SRBC injection in the modulation of the effects of psychosocial stress on antioxidant metabolism."},{"method":"Infusions of the NMDA receptor antagonist, DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) into DH prior to conditioning resulted in impaired CHA, measured with the radiant heat tail flick test, only in the trace-conditioning group when they were tested during the trace interval.","background":"We tested whether N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) are critical for the acquisition of trace fear conditioning using conditioned hypoalgesia (CHA), decrease in pain reactivity, as the conditioned response (CR) instead of commonly used freezing.","conclusion":"The same infusion had no effect on CHA in the delay-conditioned animals. The results support that NMDA receptors in DH are critically involved in associating the CS with the US across a temporal gap. In addition, temporal specificity of the CR was revealed as CHA was induced only in the temporal vicinity of the US used for the training."},{"method":"Using moderately high-speed cineradiographic filming from lateral, dorsal, and frontal perspectives, the present study describes how forelimb and skeletal bones move during the skilled reaching act.","background":"The forelimb movements (skilled reaching) used by rats to reach for a single food pellet to place into the mouth have been used to model many neurological conditions. They have been described as a sequence of oppositions of head-pellet, paw-pellet and pellet-mouth that can be described as movements of the distal portion of body segments in relation to their fixed proximal joints. Movement scoring is difficult, however, because the location and movement of body segments is estimated through the overlying fur and skin, which is pliable and partially obscures movement.","conclusion":"The analysis indicates that: (i) head movements for orienting to food, enabled by the vertical orientation of the rostral spinal cord, are mainly independent of trunk movement, (ii) skilled reaching consists of a sequence of upper arm and extremity movements each involving a number of concurrent limb segment and joint movements and (iii) food pellets are retrieved from the paw using either the incisors and\/or tongue. The findings are discussed in relation to the idea that X-ray cinematography is valuable tool for assisting descriptive analysis and can contribute to understanding general principles of the relations between whole body, head, oral, and upper extremity movement."},{"method":"Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that U50,488H failed to influence cSNC when administered before the first downshifted trial, but either attenuated (1mg\/kg) or enhanced (3 and 10mg\/kg) cSNC when administered before the second downshift trial. Experiment 3 showed that U50,488H administered immediately after the first downshift trial had no effect on cSNC at the 1mg\/kg dose, but tended to increase cSNC at the 3mg\/kg dose.","background":"A series of experiments studied the effects of the kappa-opioid receptor agonist U50,488H on consummatory successive negative contrast (cSNC) in rats. In cSNC, previous experience with a 32% sucrose solution leads to greater rejection of 4% sucrose than exclusive experience with 4% sucrose.","conclusion":"However, Experiment 4 suggested that the apparent enhancement of cSNC after 3mg\/kg U50 administered posttrial 11 may have reflected the development of a conditioned taste aversion. The trial-selective attenuating effect of the low dose may reflect an anxiolytic-like property of U50,488H."},{"method":"In the present study, unilateral lesions of the LH, which compromise nigro-striatal dopamine (NSD) function, were combined with enucleation ipsilateral or contralateral to the hemisphere where 6-hydroxydopamine was applied.","background":"Like enucleation, lateral hypothalamic (LH) lesions sever the connection between the retina and the pineal thereby simulating ambient exposure to constant darkness. While LH lesions have been employed to study either circadian function or Parkinson's disease (PD) independently, the application of such lesions to study circadian involvement specifically in this disease has never been attempted.","conclusion":"In addition to the observation that hemi-enucleation produced patterns of motor function that were grossly atypical compared to visually intact rats, hemi-enucleation ipsilateral to the side of NSD system denervation produced impairment of horizontal movement, limb retraction, ambulation and spontaneous or l-dopa induced turning. This impairment was more severe than that seen in rats with unilateral 6-OHDA lesions alone. Furthermore, hemi-enucleation contralateral to the side of unilateral NSD system denervation resulted in significantly improved performance on several parameters. While the rate of mortality in rats receiving unilateral 6-OHDA plus ipsilateral enucleation was similar to that occurring after bilateral lesions, it was not accompanied by severe weight loss and wasting that typically occurs in the acute stages of experimental PD. These results demonstrate the importance of the visual and circadian systems in PD and are consistent with reports that identify impaired circadian involvement as a major component in a wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions."},{"method":"In this study we investigated the effects of a permanent surgical bilateral vestibular deafferentation (BVD) on the performance of rats in a series of anxiety tests at 3 weeks (3-W), 3 months (3-M) and 5 months (5-M) following the lesion. We used the elevated plus maze (EPM), elevated T maze (ETM), hyponeophagia and social interaction tests.","background":"Despite frequent reports that patients with vestibular dysfunction exhibit an unusually high incidence of anxiety disorders, few studies have investigated the emotional effects of vestibular damage in animals.","conclusion":"Contrary to expectation, we found that, at 3 and 5M post-op, BVD rats spent more rather than less time on the open arms of the EPM compared to sham controls, and they displayed a lack of learned inhibitory avoidance in the ETM. Compared to sham controls, BVD rats showed no significant difference over the 3 time points in their latencies to eat in a novel situation; however, they did engage in social interaction to a significantly lesser extent. Finally, blood corticosterone levels were not significantly different between BVD and sham rats at 6 months post-op. These results suggest that BVD causes changes in the performance of rats in the EPM and ETM that might reflect emotional changes, or could be due to the cognitive impairment and hyperactivity caused by BVD."},{"method":"We applied an integrative multimodal imaging approach during acupuncture.","background":"Functional neuroimaging studies suggest that a lateral network in the brain is associated with the sensory aspects of pain perception while a medial network is associated with affective aspects. The highest concentration of opioid receptors is in the medial network. There is significant evidence that endogenous opioids are central to the experience of pain and analgesia.","conclusion":"We found functional magnetic resonance imaging signal changes in the orbitofrontal cortex, insula, and pons and [11C]diprenorphine positron emission tomography signal changes in the orbitofrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, insula, thalamus, and anterior cingulate cortex. These findings include brain regions within both the lateral and medial pain networks."},{"method":"This study was undertaken to determine the influence of such factors using four antidepressants drugs including the tricyclics imipramine (20 mg\/(kgday)) and desipramine (10 mg\/(kgday)), the tetracyclic maprotiline (20 mg\/(kgday)) and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine (10mg\/(kgday)) in both Swiss and BALB\/c mice. A 6-week UCMS regimen induced deterioration of the coat state and decreased grooming behaviours in the splash test in BALB\/c mice but not Swiss mice.","background":"There have been few comparisons of strains and antidepressants in the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) paradigm in mice.","conclusion":"The four antidepressants reversed the UCMS-induced effects in BALB\/c mice in both measures. However, imipramine and fluoxetine reached significance in the splash test while desipramine and maprotiline displayed only a trend. In conclusion, these results emphasize that BALB\/c mice are more sensitive than Swiss mice for studying the effects of the UCMS model as well as for testing antidepressant-like properties."},{"method":"In the present study, recurrent spontaneous behavioral seizures were established by repeated systemic injections of this excitotoxin into male Sprague-Dawley rats. After the seizures had been established, cells were transplanted into the substantia nigra.","background":"We have previously shown that intranigral transplants of immortalized GABAergic cells decrease the number of kainic acid-induced seizures [Castillo CG, Mendoza S, Freed WJ, Giordano M. Intranigral transplants of immortalized GABAergic cells decrease the expression of kainic acid-induced seizures in the rat. Behav Brain Res 2006;171:109-15] in an animal model.","conclusion":"Animals with transplants of control cells (without hGAD67 expression) or with sham transplants showed a death rate of more than 40% over the 12 weeks of observation, whereas in animals with M213-2O CL-4 transplants, the death rate was reduced to less than 20%. The M213-2O CL-4 transplants significantly reduced the percentage of animals showing behavioral seizures; animals with these transplants also showed a lower occurrence of stage V seizures than animals in the other groups. In vivo and in vitro analyses provided evidence that the GABAergic cells show sustained expression of both GAD67 and hGAD67 cDNA, as well as increased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the ventral mesencephalon of transplanted animals. Therefore, transplantation of GABA-producing cells can produce long-term alleviation of behavioral seizures in an animal model."},{"method":"The current study utilized two genetic animal models of depression, the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rat strains. In addition, in order to assess the interactive effects of depressive vulnerability and exposure to early life stress, the subjects were raised either in a standard rearing condition or exposed to mild chronic-stress on postnatal days (PND) 2-9. On PND 10-11, an isolation test examined the pups' emotion-regulation.","background":"Children of depressed parents exhibit high rates of emotion-dysregulation, characterized by excessive withdrawal or approach strategies toward the mother in infancy. The understanding of factors affecting the establishment of these behavioral deficits is limited.","conclusion":"WKY pups produced less separation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) and proximity-seeking behaviors, compared to controls. In addition, WKY pups did not show the expected potentiation effect that was evident in control pups (an increase in USV and pivoting behavior after a short reunion with the dam). FSL pups exhibited less proximity-seeking behaviors compared to controls while showing levels of USV, potentiation of USV, and change in proximity-seeking behaviors that were similar to controls. No differences between the strains were found in self-grooming. The early life chronic-stress paradigm had no effect on the behaviors of the pups, indicating either stress-resilience or a limited effect of the paradigm. Overall, the results tentatively imply a tendency of the WKY and FSL pups towards withdrawal behavior instead of approach-behavior when regulating emotion, with a more pronounced pattern in WKY pups. This behavioral profile is reminiscent of avoidant attachment, a characteristic of many children of depressed parents."},{"method":"The present study was designed to elucidate the phenotype of CCK(2) receptor-deficient mice housed in two different environmental conditions within the same laboratory. Environmental enrichment was used as an alternative environment to standard laboratory conditions.","background":"The behavioural phenotype of mice, lacking CCK(2) receptors, has varied across studies conducted not only in different laboratories, but also across studies published by the same laboratory.","conclusion":"Significant genotype by environment interaction was observed in the plus-maze, hot-plate, restraint-induced analgesia and water maze test. While mice, lacking CCK(2) receptors, housed in standard conditions were more anxious, displayed stronger restraint-induced analgesia and performed worse in the water maze when compared to corresponding wild-type littermates, none of these phenotypes were observed in mice, housed in enriched conditions. By contrast, in the hot-plate test, rota-rod and locomotor activity test a genotype-dependent phenotype was observed in mice housed in enriched, but not in standard conditions. Moreover, the phenotype of CCK(2) receptor-deficient mice established in the hot-plate test and rota-rod was sex-specific. These results suggest that thorough and labour-consuming study of mutation-induced behavioural phenotype is necessary not only in different genetic backgrounds but also the substantial variation of phenotype due to sex- and environment-related factors have to be explored."},{"method":"We directly compared caffeine (200mg) with napping (60-90min) and placebo on three distinct memory processes: declarative verbal memory, procedural motor skills, and perceptual learning.

A second, different, word list was administered post-intervention and memory was tested after a 20min retention period. The non-declarative tasks (finger tapping task (FTT) and texture discrimination task (TDT)) were trained before the intervention and then retested afterwards.","background":"Caffeine, the world's most common psychoactive substance, is used by approximately 90% of North Americans everyday. Little is known, however, about its benefits for memory. Napping has been shown to increase alertness and promote learning on some memory tasks.","conclusion":"Naps enhanced recall of words after a 7h and 20min retention interval relative to both caffeine and placebo. Caffeine significantly impaired motor learning compared to placebo and naps. Napping produced robust perceptual learning compared with placebo; however, naps and caffeine were not significantly different. These findings provide evidence of the limited benefits of caffeine for memory improvement compared with napping. We hypothesize that impairment from caffeine may be restricted to tasks that contain explicit information; whereas strictly implicit learning is less compromised."},{"method":"Using a Morris water maze test, we show here that while the cannabinoid HU210 significantly inhibited the performance of spatial learning without significant effects on long-term memory, Tat-3L4F did not induce significant effects on the acquisition and retrieval of spatial memory.","background":"We recently found that the interfering peptide Tat-3L4F is able not only to disrupt the protein-protein interaction of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) with the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor in the rat ventral tegmental area (VTA) but also to suppress the conditioned place preference induced by cannabinoid and nicotine without significant effects on anxiety, feeding behavior and motor activity. It is unknown, however, whether Tat-3L4F affects learning and memory.","conclusion":"These results indicate that Tat-3L4F can suppress the rewarding effects of abused drugs without significant effects on learning and memory."},{"method":"Male and female apoE3-TR, apoE4-TR, apoE-knockout and C57BL\/6J mice (15-18 months) were tested with spatial memory and avoidance conditioning tasks.","background":"Apolipoprotein (apo) E4, one of three human apoE (h-apoE) isoforms, has been identified as a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and for cognitive deficits associated with aging. However, the biological mechanisms involving apoE in learning and memory processes are unclear. A potential isoform-dependent role of apoE in cognitive processes was studied in human apoE targeted-replacement (TR) mice. These mice express either the human apoE3 or apoE4 gene under the control of endogenous murine apoE regulatory sequences, resulting in physiological expression of h-apoE in both a temporal and spatial pattern similar to humans.","conclusion":"Compared to apoE3-TR mice, spatial memory in female apoE4-TR mice was impaired based on their poor performances in; (i) the probe test of the water-maze reference memory task, (ii) the water-maze working memory task and (iii) an active avoidance Y-maze task. Retention performance on a passive avoidance task was also impaired in apoE4-TR mice, but not in other genotypes. These deficits in both spatial and avoidance memory tasks may be related to the anatomical and functional abnormalities previously reported in the hippocampus and the amygdala of apoE4-TR mice. We conclude that the apoE4-TR mice provide an excellent model for understanding the mechanisms underlying apoE4-dependent susceptibility to cognitive decline."},{"method":"In the present study, 5-week old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used along with the forced swim test (FST) and pharmacological techniques.","background":"Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a proinflammatory cytokine, is well known as a mediator in early stage inflammatory immune reactions. In recent years, accumulating evidence has shown that IL-6 is concomitant with the occurrence of major depression. However, the identification of the role of IL-6, as either an illness causation or immunotherapy in depression, remains to be further established.","conclusion":"The data show that rats subjected to 3-day intra-amygdala or intra-hippocampus, but not intra-frontal cortex, IL-6 treatments manifested a significant increase in the immobility time (IMT) in the FST. In addition, there was no obvious difference in body temperature between normal and 3-day IL-6 treated rats. Conversely, the rats receiving 3-day intra-amygdala or intra-hippocampus IL-6 inhibitor treatment expressed a significant reduction in IMT in the FST. Moreover, the 3-day IL-6 treated rats treated with SL 327, a blood-brain barrier penetrating MEK inhibitor, prior to the FST showed a significant decrease in the IL-6 elevated IMT. In addition, the results in the Western blot analysis were in parallel with those in the behavioral tests. Taken together, the results show that the immobile behavior of rats in the FST could be modulated by IL-6 via the amygdala or the hippocampus. Furthermore, the Erk1\/2 activation in the amygdala or hippocampus seemed to play a role in the IL-6 mediated immobile behavioural alterations of rats in the FST."},{"method":"In this study we tested whether inactivation of another member of this ion channel family, KCNK7, in a knockout mouse displayed altered sensitivity to the anesthetizing effect of volatile anesthetics. KCNK7 knockout mice were produced by standard gene inactivation methods. Heterozygous breeding pairs produced animals that were homozygous, heterozygous or wild-type for the inactivated gene. Knockout animals were tested for movement in response to noxious stimulus (tail clamp) under varying concentrations of isoflurane, halothane, and desflurane to define the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) preventing movement. Mice homozygous for inactivated KCNK7 were viable and indistinguishable in weight, general development and behavior from heterozygotes or wild-type littermates.","background":"The molecular site of action for volatile anesthetics remains unknown despite many years of study. Members of the K(2P) potassium channel family, whose currents are potentiated by volatile anesthetics have emerged as possible anesthetic targets. In fact, a mouse model in which the gene for TREK-1 (KCNK2) has been inactivated shows resistance to volatile anesthetics.","conclusion":"Knockout mice (KCNK7-\/-) displayed no difference in MAC for the three volatile anesthetics compared to heterozygous (+\/-) or wild-type (+\/+) littermates. Because inactivation of KCNK7 does not alter MAC, KCNK7 may play only a minor role in normal CNS function or may have had its function compensated for by other inhibitory mechanisms. Additional studies with transgenic animals will help define the overall role of the K(2P) channels in normal neurophysiology and in volatile anesthetic mechanisms."},{"method":"We tested this hypothesis by studying the relationship between duration of illness (DoI), grey matter (GM) and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) volume across the whole brain. Sixty-four patients with schizophrenia and 25 healthy controls underwent structural MRI scanning and neuropsychological assessment. We performed regression analyses in patients to examine the relationship between DoI and GM and CSF volumes across the whole brain, and correlations in controls between age and GM or CSF volume of the regions where GM or CSF volumes were associated with DoI in patients. Correlations were also performed between GM volume in the regions associated with DoI and neuropsychological performance.","background":"The frontal lobe has an extended maturation period and may be vulnerable to the long-term effects of schizophrenia.","conclusion":"A longer DoI was associated with lower GM volume in the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), right middle frontal cortex, left fusiform gyrus (FG) and left cerebellum (lobule III). Additionally, age was inversely associated with GM volume in the left dorsomedial PFC in patients, and in the left FG and CSF excess near the left cerebellum in healthy controls. Greater GM volume in the left dorsomedial PFC was associated with better working memory, attention and psychomotor speed in patients. Our findings suggest that the right middle frontal cortex is particularly vulnerable to the long-term effect of schizophrenia illness whereas the dorsomedial PFC, FG and cerebellum are affected by both a long DoI and aging. The effect of illness chronicity on GM volume in the left dorsomedial PFC may be extended to brain structure-neuropsychological function relationships."},{"method":"Thus, in the present study, we investigated the effect of fluid percussion brain injury (FPI) on a spatial learning task and levels of oxidative stress markers, namely, protein carbonylation and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and Na+,K+-ATPase activity 1 or 3 months after FPI in rats.","background":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a devastating disease that commonly causes persistent mental disturbances and cognitive deficits. Although studies indicate that oxidative stress and functional deficits occurring after TBI are interrelated events, the knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the development of such cognitive deficits has been limited.","conclusion":"Statistical analysis revealed that FPI increased the scape latency and mean number of error in Barnes maze test 1 and 3 months after FPI. We also found that protein carbonylation and TBARS content increased in the parietal cortex 1 and 3 months after FPI. In addition, 3 months after FPI, protein carbonylation levels increased both in ipsilateral and contralateral cortices of FPI animals. Indeed, statistical analysis revealed a decrease in Na+,K+-ATPase activity in the cerebral cortex of 1 month FPI animals. Furthermore, the decrease in enzyme activity found 3 months was larger, when compared with 1 month after FPI. These results suggest that cognitive impairment following TBI may result, at least in part, from increase of two oxidative stress markers, protein carbonylation and TBARS that occurs concomitantly to a decrease in Na+,K+-ATPase activity."},{"method":"Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we investigated how error-related brain activity, especially in fronto-medial wall areas, depended on motor accuracy (MA). Subjects performed a force tracking task with the thumb-index grip: to continuously follow a moving target on a monitor with a cursor which position was controlled by the force amount produced by the fingers. Task difficulty varied with changes in the cursor size (the smaller the cursor, the more difficult the task). We measured the motor accuracy (mean distance between the cursor center and the target) and the error amount (cursor out of the target). Errors were produced when motor accuracy was low and also when motor accuracy was high. For fMRI data processing, we defined a model based on both the error amount and the motor accuracy.","background":"We investigated which brain areas show error-related activity during online motor control while errors occur independently from decision making. During motor tasks, error is a deviation from accuracy or correctness. The effect of the accuracy level on error-related brain activity is unclear.","conclusion":"The results showed that supplementary motor area (SMA) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activation increased with error and task difficulty independent of the accuracy of motor control. Interestingly, activity in the rostral part of left ACC only increased with error when the motor accuracy was low, independently from task difficulty. These results suggest a clear functional dissociation between dorsal and rostral ACC in error processing which depends on the amount of attentional resources allocated to motor accuracy."},{"method":"In the present study we examined eye movements and physiological measures of memory (pupillometry) in order to compare visual scanning of spatial orientation using a human virtual analogue of the Morris Water Maze task. Twelve women and twelve men (average age=24 years) were trained on a visible platform and had to locate an invisible platform over a series of trials.

However, the exact strategies that males and females employ in order to navigate successfully around the environment are unclear. While some researchers propose that males prefer environment-centred (allocentric) and females prefer self-centred (egocentric) navigation, these findings have proved difficult to replicate.","conclusion":"While the behavioural data replicated previous findings of improved spatial performance for males relative to females, distinct sex differences in eye movements were found. Males tended to explore consistently more space early on while females demonstrated initially longer fixation durations and increases in pupil diameter usually associated with memory processing. The eye movement data provides novel insight into differences in navigational strategies between the sexes."},{"method":"A total of 20 male CBA mice, weighing 20-30 g, 5-6 weeks old were administered intraperitoneally with a single daily dose of khat extract for 5 days.

The high dose of khat extract significantly (P&lt;0.05) improved while moderate and low doses impaired accuracy for spatial memory of the platform location.

Chronic unpredictable stressors significantly increased apoptosis in hippocampal CA3 cells in both the hsf1-null and wild-type (WT) mice in the in situ TUNEL staining and induced more anxiety-like behavior in the hsf1-null mice than WT mice in the plus T-maze paradigm.

Both assays measure aspects of normal social behavior in the mouse. However, little is known regarding the salient cues present in each assay that elicit normal social approach and communication.","conclusion":"Results indicate that social olfactory cues were sufficient to elicit normal sociability in the three-chambered social approach test. On social transmission of food preference, isolated social olfactory cues were sufficient to induce social investigation, but not sufficient to induce food preference. These findings indicate that olfactory cues are important in mouse social interaction, but that additional sensory cues are necessary in certain situations. The present evidence that both the three-chambered social approach assay and the social transmission of food preference assay require socially relevant cues to elicit normal behavior supports the use of these two assays to investigate autism-related behavioral phenotypes in mice."},{"method":"Bilateral microinjections of CNQX (5.0 nmol\/side) into the Acb shell (AP, +1.08 to +2.04), but not into the Acb core, induced an anxiolytic-like effect in relation to rats microinjected with vehicle, since the animals exhibited low level of SAP in the feeding test. The anxiolytic-like effect induced by 5.0 nmol CNQX microinjection into the Acb shell may not be ascribed to changes in the motor activity of the animals, because the frequency of locomotion, rearing and grooming remained unchanged after the drug microinjection.

We hypothesized that prenatally stressed subjects would be hypersensitive to endotoxin administration and would therefore show exaggerated learning deficits, increased anxiety-like behavior, and increased peripheral and central interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) levels.","background":"Prior research suggests that prenatal stress, among other effects, can lead to hyper-reactivity of the offspring's hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and alterations in immune function. These stress-induced changes have been linked to a greater propensity to develop depression or anxiety disorders. Furthermore, prenatally stressed offspring may be more susceptible to certain diseases. The immune alterations induced by prenatal stress exposure may disrupt the normal communication between the immune system, endocrine system, and central nervous system, potentially making prenatally stressed individuals more vulnerable to the negative aspects of immune activation, including cytokine-induced cognitive deficits and anxiety.","conclusion":"The observed results only partially supported our hypotheses, as prenatally stressed subjects showed evidence, albeit modest, of increased anxiety-like behavior following endotoxin administration relative to non-stressed controls. While prenatal stress exposure or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration independently impaired learning, the data failed to support the hypothesis that prenatally stressed subjects would show exaggerated cognitive deficits, engendered via enhanced peripheral and central IL-1beta levels, following immune activation. Collectively, the data suggest that although prenatal stress exposure led to increases in anxiety-like behavior following endotoxin exposure, it did not appear to increase susceptibility to LPS-induced cognitive decline or elevations in proinflammatory cytokine production."},{"method":"To elucidate the role of the VTA in mediating exploratory, affective, and social behaviors, the present study examined effects of inhibiting 3alpha,5alpha-THP formation in the VTA.

The behavioural performance of these mouse strains in olfactory discrimination tasks was also investigated.","background":"The cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) is a neuronal anchored glycoprotein that has been associated with distinct functions in the CNS, such as cellular adhesion and differentiation, synaptic plasticity and cognition.","conclusion":"When confronted with coral snakes, mice from both Prnp(0\/0) and Tg-20 strains presented a significant decrease in frequency and duration of defensive attention and risk assessment, compared to WT mice. Tg-20 mice presented decreased frequency of escape responses, increased exploratory behaviour, and enhancement of interaction with the snake, suggesting a robust fearlessness caused by PrP(C) overexpression. Interestingly, there was also a discrete decrease in the attentional defensive response (decreased frequency of defensive alertness) in Prnp(0\/0) mice in the presence of coral snakes. Moreover, Tg-20 mice presented an increased exploration of novel environment and odors. The present findings indicate that the PrP(C) overexpression causes hyperactivity, fearlessness, and increased preference for visual, tactile and olfactory stimuli-associated novelty, and that the PrP(c) deficiency might lead to attention deficits. These results suggest that PrP(c) exerts an important role in the modulation of innate fear and novelty-induced exploration."},{"method":"A protocol was developed where rats could freely explore an OF that was physically connected to an EPM and a LDB during 15min. Classical anxiety- and locomotion-related behaviors from each test were measured. Lewis and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) inbred strains, known to present genetic differences in each of the individual tests, differed for all anxiety-related behaviors from the combined apparatus. Factor analyses revealed that similar anxiety- and locomotion-related factors were produced by the three tests applied either separately or in combination. Under both conditions, each test produced its own anxiety-related factor. Two benzodiazepines, chlordiazepoxide (at 5 and 10mg\/kg) and midazolam (at 0.75mg\/kg), facilitated the approach towards the EPM open arms, whereas pentylenetetrazole (10mg\/kg) specifically inhibited exploration of the three aversive areas (OF center, EPM open arms, LDB light compartment).","background":"Current anxiety tests do not provide, individually, a pure and complete picture of an animal's emotional profile.

The possibility that competition from enhanced grooming could account for the anorectic effect of AM 4113 was examined by yoking the pattern of disruptions caused by grooming in the AM 4113-treated group to forced locomotion in a different group fed in a modified running wheel.","background":"Cannabinoid CB1 inverse agonists such as rimonabant and AM 251 hold therapeutic promise as appetite suppressants, but the extent to which non-motivational factors contribute to their anorectic effects is not fully known. Examination of the behavioral satiety sequence (BSS) in rats, the orderly progression from eating to post-prandial grooming and then resting, has revealed that these compounds preserve the order of events but differ markedly from natural satiation. The most notable difference is that grooming (particularly scratching) is profoundly enhanced at anorectic doses, while eating and resting are diminished, raising the possibility that the anorectic effect is simply secondary to the grooming effect.","conclusion":"This response competition did not significantly reduce food intake. It was concluded that AM 4113, a CB1 neutral antagonist, produces the same effects on the BSS as AM 251, but that response competition from enhanced grooming may not be a sufficient explanation for the anorectic effects of CB1 antagonists\/inverse agonists."},{"method":"This lack of confirmation of experimental preclinical data, calls for increased efforts in translational research. Molecular imaging techniques such as PET, holds the potential to facilitate translational neuroscience by confirming observations from animal models in man, and aid development of validated animal models of use for advancement of pharmacological treatment.","background":"Animal studies and pharmacological studies in man have suggested that the serotonin 5-HT(1A) receptor may serve as a biomarker for cognitive functioning and a target for treatment of cognitive impairment. Consistent findings in man have nonetheless hitherto remained sparse. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the 5-HT(1A) receptor in patients with Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and depression implicate an alteration in 5-HT(1A) receptor binding compared to control subjects, but it is yet unknown whether these alterations are related to the cognitive impairment associated with these disorders. Pharmacological challenge studies using 5-HT(1A) agonism and antagonism to manipulate the serotonin system support involvement of the 5-HT(1A) receptor in human cognition, mainly in verbal memory functioning. However, the effect varies across studies and it remains unclear if the 5-HT(1A) receptor serves as a validated target for treatment of cognitive deficits.","conclusion":"Furthermore, in combination with molecular genetics, molecular imaging may suggest novel strategies for prevention and intervention, based on an understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in disease pathogenesis of major neuropsychiatric disorder and associated cognitive impairment."},{"method":"Rats were subjected to occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAo) by a thrombus and treated with different doses of curcumin or the vehicle at 4h after ischemia.

To evaluate the potential clinical use of curcumin, we determined the dose dependence of its effects in the therapeutic window and of the neuroprotective efficacy in a cerebral thromboembolic model of the rat.","conclusion":"Curcumin reduced in a dose-dependent manner the ischemia-induced cerebral infarct and edema volume and attenuated neurological deficits observed after 24h. Curcumin reduced post-ischemic brain neutrophil infiltration, nitrate and nitrite levels and ameliorated the loss of GSH-Px and tends to increase the GSH levels but not significantly in the brain tissue. Neuronal levels of reactive oxygen species, peroxynitrite, and nitric oxide were lowered and in brain cryosections inducible nitric oxide synthase expression were significantly inhibited after treatment with curcumin. The present study is the first evidence of effectiveness of curcumin when given 4h post-ischemia in the rat thromboembolic stroke models, as it reduces infarct volume, ameliorates the sensory motor function and significantly attenuated the nitrosative stress."},{"method":"Twenty-five healthy volunteers were observed through functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) while performing a modified Stroop paradigm.

However, sleeping time recovered to normal 14 days after withdrawal. Protein levels of GABAA receptor gamma-subunits and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) were increased in both acute and subacute cocaine withdrawal in the hypothalamus, but were normal after 14 days of withdrawal.

In females, none of the seven TCI dimensions was different between the two genotype groups. The present study thus suggests that the -34T\/C polymorphism of the CYP17 gene affects personality traits of healthy males, but not females, and this gender-dependent effect may be mediated by the action of sex hormones such as estradiol and testosterone."},{"method":"The current study investigated the behavioral effects and IL-1beta transcription following intraperitoneal LPS administration on postnatal days (PNDs) 4 and 5, and subsequent LPS or saline administration in adulthood. Alterations in anxiety, motor behavior, and learning were assessed in male and female subjects.","background":"Infection during infancy, a time of critical neural development, may have long-term implications. Infection or exposure to an immune stimulus such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) early in life leads to alterations in the reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and febrile response in adulthood. Relatively few studies have assessed the behavioral and cognitive alterations induced by perinatal immune challenge. The data indicate that neonatal immune activation may alter adulthood behavior with, or sometimes without, subsequent adulthood exposure, depending on the study.","conclusion":"The results indicate that neonatal endotoxin exposure attenuated the LPS-induced decrease in motor behavior in female, but not male, subjects. Furthermore, perinatal immune activation disrupted avoidance learning in male, but not female, subjects in the absence of adulthood LPS administration. In addition, for male subjects, neonatal LPS exposure diminished central IL-1beta gene transcription following adulthood LPS administration. These findings indicate that perinatal endotoxin exposure may lead to alterations in the behavioral response to adulthood LPS administration, and provide evidence that early immune activation alone may trigger alterations in adulthood learning ability."},{"method":"The present study investigated whether high levels of chronic CORT enhance unconditioned fear to a predator odor, trimethylthiazoline (TMT), an innate fear stimulus to rodents. TMT induces a dose-related freezing response, a prototypical behavior to fearful stimuli, in rats. The first experiment demonstrated that dose-related freezing to repeated exposures of TMT does not habituate, sensitize or produce contextually conditioned fear, and therefore can be used to measure the effects of chronic CORT on unconditioned fear to repeated exposures of TMT. In Experiment 2, 21-day release corticosterone pellets (200mg) were implanted subcutaneously in male, Sprague-Dawley rats. Control rats received sham implantation.","background":"Chronic high levels of corticosterone (CORT) are known to facilitate learning and memory of aversive events. Whether this effect of chronic CORT also generalizes to unconditioned or unlearned fear behavior is not known.","conclusion":"On days when TMT was not present, chronic CORT rats froze significantly more than sham rats. However, while TMT-induced freezing in both chronic CORT and sham rats, freezing during exposure to TMT was not further enhanced in chronic CORT rats. Thus, chronic CORT appears to increase fear as measured by freezing, possibly by enhancing vigilance, but does not facilitate fear behavior induced by the innate fear stimulus, TMT."},{"method":"The GABA(B) receptor agonist and antagonists were injected 5 min prior to naloxone injection.","background":"In the present study, the effects of intra-locus coeruleus (LC) injection of GABA(B) receptor-interacting agents on naloxone-induced withdrawal signs of morphine-dependent rats were examined.","conclusion":"Baclofen, a GABA(B) receptor agonist, decreased the TWS in a dose-dependent manner but CGP35348, a GABA(B) receptor antagonist, alone had no effect.

In a different group of rats, NPY-induced reinstatement (0.0, 4.0, and 10microg\/rat, ICV) of extinguished heroin seeking was assessed.","background":"Numerous findings suggest that drug seeking and ingestive behaviors share common neurobiological mechanisms, but the relevant pathways are unknown. Dietary manipulations result in changes in endocrine the and\/or neuropeptide signals, such as the hormones leptin and ghrelin, which are dynamically linked to energy balance and the regulation of feeding behavior. We have recently demonstrated that food deprivation-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking can be blocked with leptin, and others have suggested a role for ghrelin in drug-related behaviors. The feeding-relevant effects of leptin and ghrelin involve the inhibition or activation, respectively, of neuropeptide Y\/agouti-related peptide (NPY\/AGRP) neurons in the hypothalamus. However, the effects of NPY, a highly potent orexigenic peptide, on drug-related behaviors have not been thoroughly studied.","conclusion":"NPY injections increased on-going heroin self-administration, and induced a reinstatement of extinguished heroin-seeking behavior. These findings suggest that NPY can modulate the rewarding and conditioned reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse."},{"method":"To address this hypothesis, we examined the effect of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of leptin on food intake in Ntsr1-deficient mice. A single i.c.v. injection of leptin caused robust reductions in food intake in wild-type mice.","background":"Neurotensin plays a role in regulating feeding behavior. Central injection of neurotensin reduces food intake and the anorectic effect of neurotensin is mediated through neurotensin receptor 1 (Ntsr1). Ntsr1-deficient mice are characterized by mild hyperphagia and overweight without hyperleptinemia. The mechanism by which Ntsr1-deficient mice develop these metabolic abnormalities is not well understood. Leptin, secreted by adipocytes, regulates food intake by acting on hypothalamic neurons including neurotensin-producing neurons. Since the anorectic effect of leptin is blocked by neurotensin receptor antagonist, we hypothesized that the anorectic effect of leptin is mediated through Ntsr1 in the central nervous system and that decreased sensitivity to the anorectic effect of leptin contributes to metabolic perturbations in Ntsr1-deficient mice.","conclusion":"These effects were markedly attenuated in Ntsr1-deficient mice. These data are consistent with our hypothesis that the anorectic effect of leptin is at least partly mediated through central Ntsr1 and that the leptin-Ntsr1 signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of food intake.

The present study was designed to observe the effects of liquiritin, a flavone compound derived from Glycyrrhiza uralensis, on the behaviors of chronic variable stress induced depression model rats and to explore the possible association between its antidepressant-like effect and antioxidative activity by measuring erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) level of the experimental animals.","conclusion":"The results showed that CVS reduced open-field activity and sucrose consumption significantly, but increased immobility time in forced swimming test. Treatment of liquiritin could effectively reverse alteration in immobility time and sucrose consumption but did not show significant effect on open-field activity. Moreover, liquiritin could increase SOD activity, inhibit lipid peroxidation, and lessen production of MDA, while fluoxetine did not.

MK-801 administrated immediately after ischemia significantly decreased this hyperactivity. In all ischemic-treated animals, behavioural suppression by MK-801 was observed already 1 day after occlusion and was lasting as far as observed ischemia-dependent hypermotor responses. Beneficial effect of MK-801 was also confirmed by morphological and neurological status data.

In contrast, LPS had no significant effect on short-term working memory performance compared to saline, while scopolamine, a cholinergic antagonist known to disrupt working memory, did impair performance. The results have implications for the cognitive impairments seen in illnesses characterized by chronic cytokine activation (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) as well as illnesses treated with cytokines (e.g., multiple sclerosis) suggesting that some cognitive failures attributed to working memory impairments per se may better be attributed to prior attention impairments."},{"method":"Antinociception was assessed by tail-flick test.

This anxiogenic-like effect of the NMDA was counteracted by the pretreatment with WAY-100135 (5.0 nmol). Although 100 pmol of NMDA failed to increase inhibitory avoidance in the vehicle-pretreated group, in rats pretreated with 8-OH-DPAT this NMDA dose produced an anxiogenic-like effect. These results suggest that 5-HT(1A) and NMDA receptors interact in the dorsal PAG to modulate the anxiety-related behavior."},{"method":"To investigate this assumption we compared rat's spatial performance in the MWM and in the homing hole board (HB) tasks using a 1.5 Hz stroboscopic illumination.","background":"In the Morris water maze (MWM) task, proprioceptive information is likely to have a poor accuracy due to movement inertia. Hence, in this condition, dynamic visual information providing information on linear and angular acceleration would play a critical role in spatial navigation.","conclusion":"In the MWM, rats trained in the stroboscopic condition needed more time than those trained in a continuous light condition to reach the hidden platform. They expressed also little accuracy during the probe trial. In the HB task, in contrast, place learning remained unaffected by the stroboscopic light condition. The deficit in the MWM was thus complete, affecting both escape latency and discrimination of the reinforced area, and was thus task specific. This dissociation confirms that dynamic visual information is crucial to spatial navigation in the MWM whereas spatial navigation on solid ground is mediated by a multisensory integration, and thus less dependent on visual information."},{"method":"The experiment was carried out on young (1.5 month), adult (12 months), and old (20-24 months) rats. To determine whether the possible effects of aging on TPOA were related or not to general memory alterations, mnesic abilities of the rats were previously evaluated by submitting the animals to object recognition, olfactory discrimination, and spatial homing task.","background":"The aim of the present study was to determine the impact of aging on learning and retrieval of taste-potentiated odor aversion (TPOA). TPOA, which involves processing of odor, gustatory, and visceral cues, is a particular form of learning important to food selection.","conclusion":"It was noted that the young, the adult, and the old rats were able to learn and to retrieve TPOA whatever the stimulus - either odor or taste - used to elicit retrieval. Interestingly, it can be underlined that the rejection of the odor stimulus only was even slightly increasing with the rat age. Thus, TPOA which is important in food selection and in animal survival is spared during aging while mnesic deficits were observed in the other behavioral tasks tested according to the task requirement."},{"method":"In a mouse model of RTT (Mecp2(1lox)), we examined whether environmental enrichment (EE) alters behavioural performance and regional brain volume.

At postnatal day 44, volumes of whole brain, cerebellum, ventricles, and motor cortex were measured using magnetic resonance imaging.","background":"Rett syndrome (RTT) is an autistic spectrum developmental disorder associated with mutations in the X-linked Mecp2 gene, and severe behavioural and neuropathological deficits.","conclusion":"EE provided subtle improvements to locomotor activity and contextual fear conditioning in Mecp2(1lox) mice. Additionally, EE reduced ventricular volumes, which correlated with improved locomotor activity, suggesting that neuroanatomical changes contribute to improved behaviour.

Before each training session, the animals received an injection of vehicle or cocaine (25mg\/kg, i.p.). Immediately following the training session, an intrastriatal infusion of 2% lidocaine (1 microl) or a sham infusion were administered. Wheel-skill performance was tested before and repeatedly after the training.","background":"The sensorimotor striatum is important for procedural learning, including skill learning. Our previous findings indicate that this part of the striatum mediates the acquisition of a motor skill in a running-wheel task and that this skill learning is dependent on striatal D1 dopamine receptors. Here, we investigated whether the sensorimotor striatum is also involved in the consolidation of this skill memory and whether this consolidation is modified by the indirect dopamine receptor agonist cocaine.","conclusion":"Our results show that post-trial intrastriatal infusion of lidocaine disrupted late-stage long-term skill memory (post-training days 6-26), but spared early long-term memory (1 day after the training). Skill consolidation was more susceptible to such disruption in animals that practiced less during the training. Cocaine given pre-trial prevented this post-trial disruption of skill consolidation. These findings indicate that the sensorimotor striatum is critical for the consolidation of late but not early long-term skill memory. Furthermore, cocaine appeared to stabilize motor-memory formation by protecting consolidation processes after the training."},{"method":"After pairing an auditory conditional stimulus (CS) with an aversive footshock (unconditional stimulus or US) in one context, rats received an extinction session in which the CS was presented without the US in another context. Conditional fear to the CS was then tested in either the extinction context or a third familiar context; freezing behavior served as the index of fear. Sham-operated rats exhibited little conditional freezing to the CS in the extinction context, but showed a robust renewal of fear when tested outside of the extinction context. In contrast, rats with neurotoxic lesions in the entorhinal cortex or electrolytic lesions in the fornix did not exhibit a renewal of fear when tested outside the extinction context. Impairments in freezing behavior to the auditory CS were not able to account for the observed results, insofar as rats with either entorhinal cortex or fornix lesions exhibited normal freezing behavior during the conditioning session.","background":"Recent studies have shown that the hippocampus is critical for the context-dependent expression of extinguished fear memories. Here we used Pavlovian fear conditioning in rats to explore whether the entorhinal cortex and fornix, which are the major cortical and subcortical interfaces of the hippocampus, are also involved in the context-dependence of extinction.","conclusion":"Thus, contextual memory retrieval requires not only the hippocampus proper, but also its cortical and subcortical interfaces."},{"method":"This article presents data on hand preferences for a bimanual coordination in 29 bonobos (Pan paniscus).

This task has been used with other species, which allows reliable data comparisons. The task requires a bimanual coordinated precise action: the subject holds the tube with one hand while reaching for food inside with the other hand. As a complex task, this measure has been shown to be efficient in revealing hand preferences. It has revealed group-level right bias in chimpanzees. Bonobos had never been tested. We recorded both independent bouts (counting only the first pattern of a sequence of identical actions) and frequency (counting every action).","background":"Brain lateralization has long been thought to be unique to humans.

With frequency, 11 bonobos were classified as right-handed, 15 were left-handed and 3 had no preference. With bouts, 8 bonobos were right-handed, 9 were left-handed and 12 had no preference.

Mice were then tested 24 or 48 h later in the absence of circulating progesterone.","background":"The aim of this study was to determine if progesterone modulates object and spatial memory consolidation in young ovariectomized C57BL\/6 mice.","conclusion":"Post-training injections of 10 and 20mg\/kg progesterone enhanced object recognition, but not memory in the spatial water maze. These findings suggest that object memory consolidation in young female mice is more sensitive to the modulatory effects of progesterone than spatial memory consolidation, at least using the tasks, doses, and delays tested.

The present study was directed toward examining reach-to-eat movements in early PD patients untreated with medication, along with a follow-up examination of a PD patient sub-group who were treated with a symptomatically stable dosage of dopamine replacement.","conclusion":"UPDRS motor scores were higher for the most-affected side of the body (mean scores of 10.45 and 4.25 for more- and less-affected upper limbs, respectively), whereas reach scores were equivalently impaired for the two sides (median scores of 12.35 and 12.56 for more- and less-affected limbs, respectively). These differences between clinical and experimental assessments of motor impairments persisted among early PD patients treated with medication. Thus, functional reaching shows bilateral and symmetrical abnormalities in early PD patients, even when clinical assessment shows asymmetrical or even unilateral impairment. These findings suggest that functional qualitative reaching evaluation is a sensitive test in early PD, and that significant bilateral abnormalities in reach function are present even in pre-clinical stages of the disease."},{"method":"To investigate this issue, groups of patients with selective vascular lesions of the basal ganglia (n=13) or the cerebellum (n=14) were compared with matched healthy control groups.

It is, however, as yet unclear whether the basal ganglia and the cerebellum as components of frontostriatal\/frontocerebellar networks also contribute to the executive domains multitasking and response inhibition.","conclusion":"Basal ganglia patients showed marked response slowing during coordination of sensory input from different modalities and high error rates during the inhibition of overlearned responses.

We applied the D1 agonist SKF81297 and the D1 antagonist SCH23390 into the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), the avian functional analogue of the PFC, and simultaneously in the medial striatum (MSt), by in vivo microdialysis while the animals performed the task.","background":"Several studies have shown that the level of dopaminergic transmission and D1 receptor signaling is crucial for working memory (WM) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mammals. Thus, hyper- or hypostimulation of prefrontal D1 receptors are pathophysiological findings often involved in cognitive and WM impairments. These observations can be mimicked by supranormal stimulation or inhibition with D1 receptor agonists or D1 antagonists, respectively. As a consequence, it is assumed that there is a normal range of dopamine function in prefrontal cortex that can be described as an inverted U-shaped relationship between dopamine transmission, i.e. D1 receptor stimulation, and intact WM. If this is true, short-term fluctuations of cognitive performance might be described as small-scale adjustments along the tip of the inverted U-curve and should depend on D1 receptor stimulation.","conclusion":"Animals showed daily fluctuations in WM performance. While the D1 agonist was able to improve or to decrease performance during low or strong performance periods, respectively, performance did not differ from control with the D1 antagonist. This study shows that D1 receptors seem to calibrate differentially prefronto-striatal functions based on individual low or high performance states."},{"method":"In our present study, we investigated the effects of early auditory enrichment with music on rat auditory discrimination learning. We found that early auditory enrichment with music from postnatal day (PND) 14 enhanced learning ability in auditory signal-detection task and in sound duration-discrimination task. In parallel, a significant increase was noted in NMDA receptor subunit NR2B protein expression in the auditory cortex. Furthermore, we found that auditory enrichment with music starting from PND 28 or 56 did not influence NR2B expression in the auditory cortex. No difference was found in the NR2B expression in the inferior colliculus (IC) between music-exposed and normal rats, regardless of when the auditory enrichment with music was initiated.","background":"Previous studies have shown that the functional development of auditory system is substantially influenced by the structure of environmental acoustic inputs in early life.","conclusion":"Our findings suggest that early auditory enrichment with music influences NMDA-mediated neural plasticity, which results in enhanced auditory discrimination learning."},{"method":"The present study is the first study to evaluate the pig's ability to learn the Delayed Non-Match to Sample (DNMS) task.

We also found that pigs, in contrast to rats, do not have a natural tendency to alternate in their choices in the task. To evaluate the sensitivity to reduced memory function longer delay intervals (300 s and 900 s) and a scopolamine challenge were introduced.","background":"The pig (Sus scrofus) is a valuable animal for modeling human brain diseases.

Six weeks post-phencyclidine, analysis of brains showed a reduction in expression of parvalbumin immunoreactive neurons in the hippocampus with significant reductions localised to the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions. These results show that sub-chronic phencyclidine produces long-lasting disruptions in social interaction that, however, do not model the social withdrawal seen in patients with schizophrenia.

In contrast, during the dark phase, 3.2mg\/kg morphine produced comparable, moderately strong aversions in all strains. With 10.0mg\/kg morphine, F344 rats developed stronger aversions than either the LEW or SD rats in both phases of the light cycle. The effect of light cycle was most clearly seen in the SD rats, where stronger aversions were produced in the dark phase for both morphine doses. For the LEW rats, stronger aversions were produced in the dark as compared to the light only with the low dose of morphine. For the F344 rats, aversions of comparable strength were observed in both phases of the light cycle for both morphine doses. The finding that light cycle differentially affects morphine-induced taste aversions in these strains is consistent with what is known about strain differences in circadian patterns of corticosterone activity and with previous results relating corticosterone to morphine-induced taste aversions."},{"method":"In the current study, c-Fos counts in both basolateral and central amygdalar nuclei were observed to increase in rats 12- and 36-h food deprived (relative to 0-h controls)-an effect reversed by the presentation of either a small or large meal (2.5 or 20g of food).

In contrast, food deprivation reduced the spontaneous locomotor activity of rats, presumably as a result of an inherent energy-conservation strategy when no food is readily available. These data suggest that the state of food deprivation is associated with: (a) enhanced behavioral output only when food is attainable (increased goal-directed behavior, but decreased spontaneous activity), and (b) increased synaptic engagement in neuronal circuits involved in affective valuation and related decision-making (increased c-Fos counts in the amygdala)."},{"method":"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of epidural electrical MCS on the nociceptive threshold of naive rats.

Experimental evidence suggests that the motor cortex is also involved in the modulation of normal nociceptive response, but the underlying mechanisms of pain control have not been clarified yet.","conclusion":"When rats were evaluated by the paw pressure test, MCS induced selective antinociception in the paw contralateral to the stimulated cortex, but no changes were noticed in the ipsilateral paw. When the nociceptive test was repeated 15 min after cessation of electrical stimulation, the nociceptive threshold returned to basal levels. On the other hand, no changes in the nociceptive threshold were observed in rats evaluated by the tail-flick test. Additionally, no behavioral or motor impairment were noticed in the course of stimulation session at the open-field test. Stimulation of posterior parietal or somatosensory cortices did not elicit any changes in the general activity or nociceptive response. Opioid receptors blockade by naloxone abolished the increase in nociceptive threshold induced by MCS.

Delta(9)-THC-pretreatment caused concurrent decreases in the number of shrews expressing vomiting and Fos-immunoreactivity (Fos-IR), effects which were blocked by SR141716A-pretreatment. Acute phase vomiting induced Fos-IR in the solitary tract nucleus (NTS), dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMNX), and area postrema (AP), whereas in the delayed phase Fos-IR was not induced in the AP at all, and was induced at lower levels in the other nuclei when compared to the acute phase. CB(1) receptor-IR in the NTS was dense, punctate labeling indicative of presynaptic elements, which surrounded Fos-expressing NTS neurons. CB(2) receptor-IR was not found in neuronal elements, but in vascular-appearing structures. All areas correlated with serotonin- and Substance P-IR.","background":"Cisplatin chemotherapy frequently causes severe vomiting in two temporally separated clusters of bouts dubbed the acute and delayed phases.

This study was designed to assess the relationships between ischemic stroke induced by permanent unilateral carotid ligation in P12 CD1 mice and the structural and functional outcomes in the young mice as a consequence.","conclusion":"The ligation-injured mice were not different from controls on cylinder testing for asymmetric use of their forelimb, or on rotorod measures. In the spontaneous alternation task, however, injured mice demonstrated significantly lower rates of alternation indicating a deficit in working memory. Open-field testing repeated on two consecutive days revealed that the ligated mice were less active than the controls and that they failed to habituate to the open field environment between sessions indicating a learning deficit. Overall, our results demonstrate that ischemia induced by our neonatal stroke model produces behavioral deficits that are consistent with the brain injury."},{"method":"In this study, 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats received a 2% creatine-supplemented diet for 1 month prior to L-DOPA therapy.","background":"L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) is among the motor complications that arise in Parkinson patients after a prolonged treatment with levodopa (L-DOPA). Since previous transcriptome and proteomic studies performed in the rat model of LID suggested important changes in striatal energy-related components, we hypothesize that oral creatine supplementation could prevent or attenuate the occurrence of LID.","conclusion":"During the 21 days of L-DOPA treatment, significant reductions in abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) have been observed in the creatine-supplemented group, without any worsening of parkinsonism. In situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry analysis of the striatum also showed a reduction in the levels of prodynorphin mRNA and FosB\/DeltaFosB-immunopositive cells in creatine-supplemented diet group, an effect that was dependant on the development of AIMs. Further investigation of the bioenergetics' status of the denervated striatum revealed significant changes in the levels of creatine both after L-DOPA alone and with the supplemented diet. In conclusion, we demonstrated that combining L-DOPA therapy with a diet enriched in creatine could attenuate LID, which may represent a new way to control the motor complications associated with L-DOPA therapy."},{"method":"Lactating Sprague Dawley rats were divided into five groups and exposed for 10 min to an intruder male or to an object on postpartum day 8.

The purpose of this study was to determine if plasma prolactin (PRL) and prolactin receptor (PRL-R(L)) mRNA expression in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of lactating rats are altered in association with maternal aggression.","conclusion":"Lower levels of prolactin were found 30 min after the aggression test. No change was detected in the number of cells expressing PRL-R(L) mRNA by in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH) as a function of testing. However, the correlation between plasma PRL and PRL-R(L) mRNA expression in the mothers changed from positive in control females to negative in intruder exposed animals. These data support the concept that a maternal aggressive experience, while acutely altering PRL secretion, fails to affect PRL-R(L) mRNA expression."},{"method":"Here we characterise the 5-HT4 partial agonist SL65.0155 compared to the reference drug, nicotine, in a test that is used to measure attention in rats, the five-choice serial reaction time task (5CSRTT). SL65.0155 (0.1 or 1 mg\/kg s.c) and nicotine (0.2 mg\/kg s.c.) were tested in protocols using fixed or variable stimulus durations.","background":"5-HT4 agonists are currently being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and have previously been demonstrated to improve cognitive performance in a variety of tests but none that specifically test attention.","conclusion":"SL65.0155 improved performance by virtue of reducing incorrect responses and increasing % correct trials. Perseverative responses were reduced by SL65.0155, and latency during incorrect trials was increased following treatment with 0.1 mg\/kg SL65.0155. Nicotine, as previously reported, improved performance in several parameters in the 5CSRTT, including response latencies, errors of omission and correct responses in both the baseline and variable stimulus protocol. These data suggest 5-HT4 agonists may have beneficial effects on attention and thereby may be useful for the treatment of cognitive deficits."},{"method":"In the present study, the effects of bilateral intra-accumbal administration of AM251, a CB1 receptor antagonist, on the acquisition and expression of ineffective dose of morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in morphine-sensitized rats were investigated. 158 adult male albino Wistar rats were used in these experiments. Subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of morphine (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2.5 and 5mg\/kg) induced CPP only at the dose of 5mg\/kg. In addition, repeated administration of morphine (5mg\/kg; s.c.), once daily for 3 days followed by 5 days free of the opioid (sensitization period), increased conditioning response induced by ineffective doses of morphine (0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 mg\/kg). Bilateral intra-accumbal administration of AM251 (5, 25 and 125 ng\/0.5 microl per side) dose-dependently reduced the acquisition and expression of morphine-induced CPP in morphine-sensitized rats, while bilateral intra-accumbal administration of neither saline nor DMSO (0.5 microl\/side) had effects on the acquisition and expression of morphine-induced CPP in sensitized rats.","background":"It has been shown that cannabinoids interact with the opiate system in reward-related behaviors and in animal models of addiction.","conclusion":"The results indicated that CB1 receptors within the nucleus accumbens are involved in the acquisition and expression of morphine-induced CPP in sensitized rats.

These data indicate that environmental enrichment significantly affects nociceptive responses."},{"method":"We employed resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) to examine brain regions with a functional connection to PCC in a mild AD group compared with matched control subjects. PCC connectivity was gathered by investigating synchronic low frequency fMRI signal fluctuations with a temporal correlation method.","background":"Resting-state networks dissociate in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in AD brain is vulnerable to isolation from the rest of brain. However, it remains unclear how this functional connectivity is related to PCC changes.","conclusion":"We found asymmetric PCC-left hippocampus, right dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex and right thalamus connectivity disruption. In addition, some other regions such as the bilateral visual cortex, the infero-temporal cortex, the posterior orbital frontal cortex, the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and the precuneus showed decreased functional connectivity to the PCC. There were also some regions, primarily in the left frontal-parietal cortices, that showed increased connectivity. These regions included the medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex, the left basal ganglia and the left primary motor cortex. Impairments to memory, high vision-related functions and olfaction in AD can be explained by a disruption to the functional connection of resting-state networks. The results of increased connectivity may support the compensatory-recruitment hypothesis. Our findings suggest that the characteristics of resting-state functional connectivity could plausibly provide an early imaging biomarker for AD."},{"method":"We examined the behavioural effects of habituating rats to a walled open field, and then of changing the environmental context by altering wall patterns and floor colour. These kinds of cue change are known to elicit spatial remapping in hippocampal regions, but not the subiculum.","background":"Studies show that changes in environmental context alter the spatial firing patterns ('remapping') and increase immediate early gene activation in hippocampal but not subicular neurons. However, such studies rarely report co-occurring behavioural responses.","conclusion":"Relative to controls (no cue alterations), alteration of wall patterns elicited significant increases in exploratory locomotion through the open field, while combined alterations of floor colour and wall patterns elicited an even higher increase in exploratory locomotion. In addition, combined alterations (floor colour and wall patterns) significantly increased rearing frequency, and significantly decreased the time the rats spent immobile. These findings are relevant to how changes in environmental context affect neuronal responses in the hippocampal formation, and may aid in the development of novelty-response tasks where novelty resides in open field surfaces."},{"method":"The current study revealed that excitotoxic lesions of the medial or lateral striatum significantly impaired acquisition, as measured by errors and latency, on this task without disruption of motor function.","background":"The 14-unit T-maze has proven to be a valuable tool for investigating age-associated memory impairment (AAMI). While another task widely used to evaluate AAMI, the water maze, is primarily used to evaluate allocentric hippocampal-dependent spatial memory, the 14-unit T-maze can assess egocentric procedural memory. Although several brain structures, e.g. hippocampus, parietal cortex, have been implicated in acquisition and retention performance in the 14-unit T-maze, there has been no evaluation of the involvement of the striatum, a brain region implicated in procedural learning and memory.","conclusion":"These results indicate that the 14-unit T-maze most likely is requires a large egocentric procedural learning component, and previously observed AAMI may involve age-related dysfunction of the striatum."},{"method":"Here, we tested if nicotine enhanced the activity of citalopram or reboxetine in the mouse forced swim test (mFST) and the mouse tail suspension test (mTST). The potential for mecamylamine to augment antidepressant drug action was also investigated. Sub-threshold and threshold doses of citalopram (3 and 10mg\/kg) or reboxetine (3, 10 and 20mg\/kg) were tested alone and in combination with nicotine (0.3 and 1.0mg\/kg) and mecamylamine (1 and 3mg\/kg). Locomotor activity experiments were performed to rule out non-specific stimulant effects.","background":"Current literature suggests that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are involved in major depression. In rodents, antidepressant-like effects of both nicotine and the non-selective nAChR antagonist mecamylamine have been reported. Nicotine increases serotonergic and noradrenergic neuronal activity and facilitates serotonin and noradrenaline release. Thus, we hypothesise that nicotine may enhance the behavioural effects of serotonin (e.g., citalopram) and\/or noradrenaline (e.g., reboxetine) reuptake inhibitors.","conclusion":"Nicotine (1.0mg\/kg) enhanced the effect of 10mg\/kg citalopram and 20mg\/kg reboxetine in the mFST. Similarly, nicotine (1.0mg\/kg) enhanced the effect of 3 and 10mg\/kg citalopram and 3 and 10mg\/kg reboxetine in the mTST. No concomitant locomotor stimulation was observed at the tested dose combinations. Mecamylamine was effective on its own in some tests, but did not augment the effects of citalopram or reboxetine at the doses tested. The data show that nicotine enhances the effects of both serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, possibly reflecting nicotine's facilitating effects on the release of these two neurotransmitters, and indicating that nicotine may enhance antidepressant action."},{"method":"Infant rats (pups) at days 7 and 10 postpartum were videotaped in individual and group trials in a temperature-controlled arena for 12min. Pups were tracked every 5s for tip-of-the-nose and base-of-the-tail coordinate positions. These positional data were transformed, using computer algorithms, into measures of activity, change in orientation, distance moved, cells occupied, wall contact, number of corners visited, and degree of aggregation.","background":"This study investigated behavioral differences between neonatal rats with vasopressin AVP deficiency (di\/di) and those with little (+\/di) or no deficiency (+\/+) using a number of open field metrics.","conclusion":"Analysis of these data revealed some phenotypic differences among genotypes for 7-day-old pups in individual trials, but there was no clear pattern of genotypic differences. By day 10, however, there were dramatic differences. AVP deficient pups differed significantly from both +\/+ and +\/di pups on most individual and group metrics. As measured by effect size, group effects were especially large. The behavioral results were consistent with previous findings in adult di\/di rats and indicated that 10-day-old di\/di pups were hyperactive and had social deficits. AVP deficient pups also appeared to have accelerated locomotor development and to exhibit stereotypic behavior. These results suggest that Brattleboro, di\/di, pups are a potentially important animal model for investigating the role of AVP in early locomoter and social development. These behavioral metrics are generalizable to infants of other rodent species and thus may allow early behavioral phenotyping and the assessment of behavioral deficits."},{"method":"The present experiment examined the effect of nociceptive conditioning in normal, TIS and lidocaine-treated rabbits. This involved three separate phases. In phase one all animals were trained on a continuous performance test (CPT). In the second phase animals were given Pavlovian conditioning to an auditory CS paired with a nociceptive US. In the third phase the animals are given a sensory recognition test. The control group were conditioned during a normal state, the TIS group were conditioned during TIS, the pain control animals were conditioned after lidocaine injection in the skin area stimulated by the nociceptive US.","background":"The tonic immobility state (TIS) in rabbit has great potential as an animal model of hypnosis in humans, due to the strong similarities between TIS and hypnosis. It is additionally the only mammalian model available for studying mechanisms of hypnosis. However, its ability to modulate pain perception has yet to be clearly determined.","conclusion":"All animals in the normal group showed the greatest amount of pain conditioning, with an average disruption time (dt) of 175s. Animals in the lidocaine group showed little signs of conditioning with an average dt of 16s. Animals conditioned during TIS had an average dt of 42s. These results show that TIS can modulate pain perception similar to animals that did not experience a pain CS. They additionally argue that tonic immobility can produce attenuation of pain perception similar to hypnosis in humans."},{"method":"Animals were trained to self-administer amphetamine under a fixed ratio 1 (FR1) schedule (0.1mg\/kg\/infusion).

To study the effects of NTX on operant behaviour, animals were trained to lever press for food pellets under a FR1 schedule of reinforcement.","background":"Amphetamine produces its rewarding effects by enhancing dopamine transmission in the mesocorticolimbic pathway.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the unselective opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (NTX) on reinstatement of amphetamine self-administration in the rat.","conclusion":"Results from the present study shows that a single injection of amphetamine reinstated self-administration behaviour. NTX (0.3 and 1.0mg\/kg) significantly attenuated the amphetamine-induced reinstatement but NTX had no effect at any dose studied on food taking behaviour. These results show that NTX attenuates reinstatement of amphetamine self-administration in rats without suppressing general behaviour, implicating a functional role for opioid receptors in modulating amphetamine seeking behaviour."},{"method":"Here, we examined the role of intra-vBNST noradrenergic transmission in the negative affective component of visceral pain induced by intraperitoneal acetic acid injection. In vivo microdialysis showed that extracellular noradrenaline levels within the vBNST significantly increased after intraperitoneal acetic acid injection.

We demonstrated the crucial role of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the negative affective component of somatic and visceral pain induced by intraplantar formalin and intraperitoneal acetic acid injections, respectively, in rats. Recently, we reported the involvement of enhanced noradrenergic transmission via beta-adrenoceptors within the ventral BNST (vBNST) in formalin-induced aversion.","conclusion":"These results suggest that enhanced noradrenergic transmission via beta-adrenoceptors within the vBNST plays a pivotal role in the negative affective, but not sensory, component of visceral pain."},{"method":"we studied specific concentrations of BDNF and NGF protein in several brain regions of ABG and ABH mice.","background":"Although genetically closely related AB-Halle (ABH) and AB-Gatersleben (ABG) mice inbred strains differ in activity and aggressive behaviour. These behavioural traits have been observed especially in response to social challenges, where ABH mice develop a highly aggressive and active behaviour, which cannot be observed in their ABG counterparts. In contrast to ABG mice, basal brain serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline concentrations in ABH mice are low but highly stimulated by social challenges. Since brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) modulates central neurotransmitter systems and has been involved in aggressive and activity behaviour,","conclusion":"A significant higher concentration of BDNF protein was found in the hippocampus of 5 weeks and 5 months old ABH mice, when compared to ABG mice. BDNF was also higher in the cortex of 5 weeks and 5 months old ABH mice. Moreover BDNF concentrations were higher in the striatum of 5 months old ABH mice when compared to ABG mice. NGF concentrations in ABH mice were not changed in all measured brain regions but higher in older age in the hippocampus of ABG mice as compared to ABH mice.

The corresponding occupancy of MCH(1) receptors in rat striatum was also measured across a broad dose range. Orally administered (p.o.) SNAP 94847 (1-10 mg\/kg) corresponds to 30-60% occupancy at MCH(1) receptors and significantly blocks water drinking induced by the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of MCH. MCH (i.c.v.) significantly elevates plasma levels of ACTH in rats, and SNAP 94847 (2.5 mg\/kg, p.o.) blocks MCH-evoked ACTH release. Using the chronic mild stress paradigm, we show that repeated daily exposure to environmental stressors for 5 weeks significantly suppresses sucrose intake in rats, and that SNAP 94847 (1 mg\/kg, BID) for 1-5 weeks restores baseline sucrose intake.","background":"Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is an orexigenic and dipsogenic neuropeptide that has been reported to mediate acute behavioral and neuroendocrine stress-related responses via MCH(1) receptor activation in rodents.

The regulation of ACTH release and reversal of the effects of chronic and acute stress by SNAP 94847 are suggestive of a role for MCH(1) receptor blockade in the treatment of disorders characterized by high allostatic load."},{"method":"In the present study we evaluated whether the activation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A\/2C receptors in the ventrolateral column of the periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) causes differential effects on an anxiety- and a panic-related defensive behavior, respectively, inhibitory avoidance and escape, in male Wistar rats submitted to the elevated T-maze.","background":"Evidences from studies using electrical or chemical stimulation of the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) suggest that whereas the dorsal PAG is critical for the regulation of panic-related defensive behaviors, the ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG) modulates generalized anxiety-related responses.","conclusion":"Our results showed that intra-vlPAG injection of the endogenous agonist serotonin, the 5-HT1A\/7 agonist 8-OH-DPAT or 5-HT2A\/2C agonist DOI impaired the acquisition of inhibitory avoidance, without interfering with escape performance. The same selective anxiolytic effect was also observed after local administration of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam. Moreover, as shown by the results of antagonism studies, 5-HT2A receptors are recruited for the anxiolysis caused by serotonin and DOI, while 5-HT1A receptors account for the effect of 8-OH-DPAT. In conclusion, our data show that the activation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors in the vlPAG affects defensive responses related to generalized anxiety, but not panic disorder."},{"method":"We examined this hypothesis by localizing color-sensitive areas (CSA) and word and letter sensitive areas of cortex and then examining modulation of these regions during performance of a modified version of the Stroop task in which target and distractors are spatially coincident.","background":"Models of selective attention predict that focused attention to spatially contiguous stimuli may result in enhanced activity in areas of cortex specialized for processing task-relevant and task-irrelevant information.","conclusion":"We report that only the incongruent condition with the highest cognitive demand showed increased activity in CSA relative to other conditions, indicating an attentional enhancement in target processing areas. We also found an enhancement of activity in one region sensitive to word\/letter processing during the most cognitively demanding incongruent condition indicating greater processing of the distractor dimension. Correlations with performance revealed that top-down modulation during the task was critical for effective filtering of irrelevant information in conflict conditions. These results support predictions made by models of selective attention and suggest an important mechanism of top-down attentional control in spatially contiguous stimuli."},{"method":"From an outbred Wistar strain, we have selected male rats regarded as anxious or non-anxious on the basis of their scores on two behavioural tests of unconditioned anxiety, the elevated plus-maze and the light\/dark box test. They were also screened for their locomotor activity in an inescapable novel environment and for their preference for novelty presented in a free-choice. Rewarding effects of cocaine (2.5-20 mg\/kg; i.p.) were then determined in the conditioned place preference paradigm (CPP). Anxious and non-anxious rats showed no difference in their responsiveness to inescapable novelty or their preference for novelty in a free-choice procedure.","background":"Some clinical studies have shown that anxiety disorders are often associated with drug dependence, although it remains unclear whether these disorders are primary or secondary to drug abuse. We have investigated whether anxiety may be a factor that predisposes to cocaine use.","conclusion":"Only anxious rats developed a CPP induced by increasing doses of cocaine, the magnitude of CPP induced by the 10 mg\/kg dose of cocaine being significantly higher than that observed in anxious rats conditioned with saline. These results suggest that anxiety affects the sensitivity to aversive\/anxiogenic effects of cocaine. Thus, anxious rats which were highly responsive to positive effects of cocaine may be more prone to develop cocaine addiction than non-anxious rats."},{"method":"Experiment 1 showed that Dark-to-Light transitions robustly reduce startle responses and PPI. Experiment 2 showed that this phenomenon habituates across repeated testing sessions and reappears after an interval without testing.

Among other factors, pyridostigmine, used as a prophylaxis treatment against intoxication by nerve agents, has been proposed by many authors as a cause of late social and\/or cognitive dysfunction related to GWI. One of the hypotheses placed to explain these behavioural disorders is that operational stress has modified the side effects of pyridostigmine given to soldiers.","conclusion":"We observed that this stress induces impulsiveness and aggressiveness in adult male rat. Moreover, pyridostigmine treatment administered daily 30 min before each stressful session amplifies these behavioural disorders and induces long-term learning dysfunction and slight but significant decrease in phosphocholine level in hippocampus.

Our companion paper (see part 1 in the same journal issue) describes that PB treatment administered in repeated stress conditions results in long-term perturbations of learning and social behaviour.","conclusion":"10 days of stress alone induce a decrease in hypothalamic Il-1alpha expression. Treatment with PB alone increases mineralocorticoid receptor expression in hypothalamus which means that PB may thus modify stress perception by animals. Stressed-PB animals showed increase in hippocampal expression of BDNF, TrkB and CamKIIalpha, three genes implicated in memory development. As a supplement to previous studies showing behavioural and biochemical effects of the association of stress with PB, our data reveal that behavioural effects of this association may be linked with genomic changes in hippocampus.

This difference was maintained for all the five generations even though we observed a progressive decline in the response to artificial selection in subsequent generations for both strains. Overall, anatomical evidence suggests that selection for right-eye use significantly increased the frequency of reversed asymmetry in the epithalamus while selection for left-eye use decreased it. However, the response was irregular since not all samples conformed to this pattern.

Conversely, VFD-females, but not HFD-females, behaved less anxious than LFD-females. Our results demonstrate (1) that maternal behaviour in C57BL\/6 mice is sensitive to specific characteristics of the environment, (2) that even subtle environment-dependent variations in maternal behaviour can have persistent effects on the offspring's behavioural phenotype, (3) that other factors besides active maternal care must have contributed to these effects, and (4) that male and female offspring may be differentially sensitive to early maternal and\/or environmental cues."},{"method":"The present study of a conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm in crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) explores morphine-induced reward, extinction and reinstatement. Repeated intra-circulatory infusions of 2.5 microg\/g, 5.0 microg\/g and 10.0 microg\/g doses of morphine over 5 days serve as a reward when paired with a distinct visual or tactile environment. Morphine-induced CPP was extinguished after repeated saline injections for 5 days in the previously morphine-paired compartment. After the previously established CPP had been eliminated during the extinction phase, morphine-experienced crayfish were challenged with 2.5 microg\/g, 5.0 microg\/g and 10.0 microg\/g, respectively.","background":"Several lines of evidence suggest that exploring the neurochemical basis of reward in invertebrate species may provide clues for the fundamental behavioral and neurobiology underpinnings of drug addiction. How the presence of drug-sensitive reward relates to a decrease in drug-seeking behavior and reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior in invertebrate systems is not known.","conclusion":"The priming injections of morphine reinstated CPP in all training doses, suggesting that morphine-induced CPP is unrelenting, and that with time, it can be reinstated by morphine following extinction in an invertebrate model just like in mammals. Together with other recent studies, this work demonstrates the advantage of using crayfish as an invertebrate animal model to investigate the basic biological processes that underline exposure to mammalian drugs of abuse."},{"method":"Using a variable interval reinforcement schedule, we looked for increased responding within each interval, at around the durations of the last three intervals.","background":"Several existing theoretical models of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) predict that a high or low learning rate contributes to some cases of ADHD; and that this is controlled by the dopamine signal. The Spontaneously Hypertensive (Hyperactive) Rat has an abnormal Dopamine Transporter (DAT), which is likely to be hypofunctional, thereby increasing the dopamine concentration and the learning rate. We therefore test the prediction that the SHR learns too fast.","conclusion":"At the time predicted by the previous interval, SHR responded significantly (10%) more than their baseline rate, and control WKY rats similarly less than their baseline. At the time predicted by the second (and third) previous intervals, there were minor trends (and no change) in the same direction. In summary, at the times predicted, SHR respond more than control rats. The effect size is insufficient to account for all the differences from control rats, such as their nearly threefold greater operant responding. At the times when SHR increase responding, WKY suppress it. This demonstrates similar learning to the SHR but the opposite response, probably due to anxiety about the bang accompanying reinforcer delivery: WKY are known to have a very negative response to stress. Interval schedules with randomised interval lengths have considerable potential for assessing multiple causes of behaviour, particularly those acting over short timecourses. Alterations in learning rate are not a sufficient explanation for either SHR or ADHD difference from controls."},{"method":"Empirical demonstration of such a process requires, as a first step, the development of standard criteria for identifying drive-based, versus learning-based, changes in behaviour. Using a variable-interval reinforcement schedule, we looked over a range of timescales for behavioural changes showing putative characteristics of drives, namely: low information content, unidirectionality, saturability, spontaneous reversibility in less than a day, and cycle stability. SHR lacks normal down-regulation of responding when the schedule becomes sparser. SHR appears to be re-learning the schedule length during the days of each calendar week. SHR hyperactivity is specific to the operant and develops gradually over the first five minutes of each session.","background":"An important aspect of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is its temporary amelioration by novelty and by stimulant medication. Extant learning-based accounts of ADHD are unable to account for the temporary amelioration effect. One possible mechanism is a drive for novelty. Computational simulations have previously shown that such a drive can result from a \"dopamine appetite\".","conclusion":"Empirical within-session results were replicated by a simple simulation containing two interacting reward systems, one for water and the other for stimulation (including novelty). To summarise, enhanced sensation-seeking (or a subtype of it, novelty-seeking) provides the best available account of changes in SHR activity within sessions, though not of changes over longer timecourses. Sensation-seeking appears to be associated with low anxiety in the SHR. SHR propensity to display multiple influences on their behaviour makes them ideal for further pharmacological, genetic, and behavioural investigation."},{"method":"From a large dataset of holepokes and tray-reports by rats in a variable interval reinforcement schedule, we extracted numerous short sequences of intervals on the basis of the first, second, and third derivatives of reinforcement timing (i.e. rate, acceleration, and jerk) in recent intervals. Sets of selected intervals were compared with one another to elucidate the effect of these different derivatives on behaviour in the current interval.","background":"Variable intervals are widely believed to produce steady rates of responding. However, based on the calming effect of unpredictability in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) we hypothesised that an animal model of this disorder, the Spontaneously Hyperactive (or Hypertensive) Rat, would become less active following particularly variable sequences of interval-lengths in a variable interval schedule.","conclusion":"Results show that SHR are more active after richer recent reinforcement; after decelerating reinforcers; and after predictable reinforcers. The hypothesis is supported. In conclusion, SHR behaviour largely complies with the Extended Temporal Difference model which in turn has been previously validated against published data in ADHD. The Extended TD model therefore is able to account for two species' behaviour in a wide range of experimental paradigms. SHR are similar in several respects to group averages of children with ADHD, except that SHR have reduced variability and perform actions faster than controls. Hyperactivity in the SHR is very dependent on momentary environmentally determined states, which is an important area for future investigation of ADHD."},{"method":"The lesion of the dopamine innervation was produced by the injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the dorsal part of the thalamic reticular nucleus. The lesion decreased the number of TH (+) cells of the pars compacta of substantia nigra by 33%, without modifying the number of TH (+) cells in ventral tegmental area.","background":"We have studied the effect of the lesion of the dopaminergic innervation of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRn) on anxiety and motor behaviour.","conclusion":"The lesion increased the time spent by the rats on the open arms of the elevated plus maze and decreased the duration of burying in the shock-probe test. Both results suggest reduced anxiety. The loss of the dopamine innervation to the TRn decreased the number of rearings but did not significantly affect total motor activity, gait or motor coordination, as evidenced by rotarod performance. These findings suggest that dopamine in the TRn plays a role in fear-related behaviour."},{"method":"Individual differences in the distribution of frontal gamma power during rest were highly correlated with concurrent language and cognitive skills at all ages. Gamma power was also associated with attention measures; children who were observed as having better inhibitory control and more mature attention shifting abilities had higher gamma power density functions. We included a group of children with a family history of language impairment (FH+) and thus at higher risk for language disorders.","background":"High-frequency cortical activity in humans and animals has been linked to a wide variety of higher cognitive processes. This research suggests that specific changes in neuronal synchrony occur during cognitive processing, distinguished by emergence of fast oscillations in the gamma frequency range. To determine whether the development of high-frequency brain oscillations can be related to the development of cognitive abilities, we studied the power spectra of resting EEG in children 16, 24 and 36 months of age.","conclusion":"FH+ children, as a group, showed consistently lower gamma over frontal regions than the well-matched FH- controls with no such family history (FH-). We suggest that the emergence of high-frequency neural synchrony may be critical for cognitive and linguistic development, and that children at risk for language impairments may lag in this process."},{"method":"This protocol is based on an initial series of training trials with a visible platform, followed by a memory test with a hidden platform 24h later. We validated this procedure using aged (15-18m) mice expressing three Alzheimer's disease-related transgenes, PS1(M146 V), APP(Swe), and tau(P301L). We also tested these triple transgenic mice (3xTG) and age and sex-matched wild-type (WT) in a behavioral battery consisting of tests of motor coordination (balance beam), spatial memory (object displacement task) visual acuity (novel object recognition task) and locomotor activity (open field).","background":"We present a 2-day water maze protocol that addresses some of potential confounds present in the water maze when using the aged subjects typical of studies of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.","conclusion":"3xTG mice had significantly longer escape latencies in the memory trial of the 2-day water maze test than WT and than their own baseline performance in the last visible platform trial. In addition, this protocol had improved sensitivity compared to a typical probe trial, since no significant differences between genotypes were evident in a probe trial conducted 24h after the final training trial. The 2-day procedure also resulted in good reliability between cohorts, and controlled for non-cognitive factors that can confound water maze assessments of memory, such as the significantly lower locomotor activity evident in the 3xTG mice. A further benefit of this method is that large numbers of animals can be tested in a short time."},{"method":"If the wake episode exceeds 300 s the wake episode is assigned to long-duration wake (LDW), if the episode is less than 300 s it is assigned to brief wake (BW). Further support for this separation was found in close analysis of the EEG power spectrum in BW versus LDW. We then used LDW episodes to separate one sleep episode from another. We term the sleep episodes vigilance cycling (VC) because the rat is cycling between the vigilance states of BW, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and rapid-eye movement sleep (REMS).","background":"Rats are polyphasic sleepers. However, a formal definition of when one sleep episode ends and another begins has not been put forth. In the present study we examine the distribution of wake episode durations and based on this distribution conclude there are multiple components of wake.","conclusion":"We find that the characteristics of VC are different in the light period versus the dark period. We further find that as VC episodes progress, SWS pressure lessens, but the amount of time spent in REMS increases. These findings suggest that VC episodes are regulated and meaningful to the sleep behavior of rats. The use of the concepts of LDW and VC provides additional insights into the description of sleep patterns in rats that may be important in the development of a complete description of sleep behavior in this animal."},{"method":"In Experiment 1, fasted chicks reduced food and water intake after central injection of CGRP. These effects were not associated with increased plasma corticosterone concentration. In Experiment 2, we showed that the effect on water intake was independent of food intake. In Experiment 3, central CGRP caused increased c-Fos immunoreactivity in the arcuate (ARC) nucleus, paraventricular nucleus (PVN), periventricular (PHN) and ventromedial (VMH) hypothalamic nuclei. The results of Experiment 4 demonstrate that intraperitoneal injection of CGRP also causes reduced food and water intake. c-Fos immunoreactivity was increased in the ARC, PHN, PVN and VMH in Experiment 5 after intraperitoneal injection of CGRP. Lastly in Experiment 6, we showed that central CGRP changes the type of pecks from feeding to exploratory, and reduces the number of escape attempts.","background":"Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is released from the gastrointestinal tract following ingestion and causes satiety in mammals. Its effects on appetite in non-mammalian vertebrates are unreported.","conclusion":"The effect of CGRP appears to be primary on appetite in chicks. In conclusion, the mechanisms of CGRP induced satiety have some similarities and differences between avian and rodent models. The results presented here provide new insight into the evolution of vertebrate satiety regulatory mechanisms."},{"method":"In this study the contribution of D2L isoform to emotional response was investigated by examining behaviors that reflect emotionality (exploratory behavior, anxiety-like behavior and learned helplessness) in D2L-\/- and (wild-type) WT mice. While the thigmotactic, locomotor and general components of anxiety in zero maze did not differ among the genotypes, D2L-\/- mice displayed significantly lower level of exploration in a hole board and zero maze, and significantly higher increase in latency to escape from a foot-shock after the learned helplessness training, compared with WT mice.","background":"The dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) system has been implicated in emotional processing which is often impaired in neuropsychiatric disorders. The long (D2L) and the short (D2S) isoforms of D2R are generated by alternative splicing of the same gene. To study differential roles of the two D2R isoforms, D2L-deficient mice (D2L-\/-) expressing functional D2S were previously generated.","conclusion":"These results suggest that D2L may play a more prominent role than D2S in mediating emotional response, such as behavioral reactions to novelty and inescapable stress. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying emotional responses."},{"method":"Employing two mouse strains (BALB\/cJ [BALB] and C57BL\/6J [B6]) with genetically based differences in social affect and circadian rhythms, we examined how social investigation (SI) is modulated by social deprivation and circadian factors.","background":"Daily routines in animal activities range from sleep-wake cycles, to foraging bouts, to social interactions. Among animals living within groups, it is unclear whether the motivations that underlie social interactions respond to daily light-dark (LD) cycles or endogenous circadian rhythms.","conclusion":"We found a genetic influence on SI that was moderated by the preceding duration of social deprivation, requiring 3-6 h of social isolation prior to testing. Following 6h of social deprivation, the SI responses of adolescent B6 mice were greater than those of BALB mice only when the isolation period was imposed during the dark phase of the LD cycle. When B6 mice were weaned into conditions of constant darkness, a novel, endogenous social rhythm emerged, which was characterized by two pronounced peaks of social responsiveness (relative to one peak under LD entrainment) that were separated by 12-h intervals. Irrespective of the lighting conditions during social isolation, the SI responses of adolescent BALB mice did not oscillate across the day. Similar strain-dependent patterns of sociability were evident within groups of mice that were left undisturbed in their home cage under LD entrainment or constant darkness. Overall, genetic influences on the social phenotypes of adolescent mice are thus moderated by an interaction between social deprivation and oscillations of an endogenous social rhythm that entrains to the LD cycle."},{"method":"Male and female Long-Evans rats were trained and tested in skilled reaching and skilled walking tasks. Both groups of animals were then exposed to daily restraint stress for 15 days. Recovery from daily stress was assessed by comparing reaching performance at 10 min versus 60 min after restraint stress, and recovery from chronic stress was tested for 21 days after cessation of stress. Animals were tested daily in skilled reaching for the entire period.","background":"Sex differences exist in skilled movement, and skilled motor performance is also influenced by stress. As shown for cognitive function, the effects of stress are usually characterized by considerable sexual dimorphism. The purpose of this study was to investigate sex differences in skilled motor function in response to stress.","conclusion":"Observations showed that females performed significantly better than males during the stress period in terms of reaching success and number of attempts needed to grasp a food pellet. No difference between testing at 10 or 60 min after daily stress was found. Analysis of movement patterns and recovery from stress indicated that males and females use different strategies to overcome stress-induced motor disturbance. While male rats preferred to use original movement patterns, females tended to modify these patterns in order to increase reaching success. Modification of movement patterns in female rats was accompanied by a faster recovery in success rate after the cessation of stress. These results indicate sex differences in skilled reaching in response to stress, and in the recovery period after stress."},{"method":"Here, in a novel paradigm, subjects learn to respond to alternating presentation of computer-animated zebrafish images.","background":"Zebrafish is used in forward genetic and drug screening and is gaining popularity in behavioral brain research but high throughput learning paradigms are lacking.

VMH injections of leptin induced identical reductions in expression levels of CART, SOCS3, PTGES, and TNF-alpha in both VMH areas; except TH mRNA, whose expression was lowered ipsilaterally. Food intake, body and fat pad weights and serum insulin and leptin were also decreased in rats given leptin through VMH.

Proestrous (WT or betaERKO), versus diestrous, mice had higher E(2) and progestin levels in plasma, hippocampus, and cortex. The only effect of genotype on hormone levels was for corticosterone, such that betaERKO mice had higher concentrations of corticosterone than did WT mice.","background":"17beta-Estradiol (E(2)) may influence cognitive and\/or affective behavior in part via the beta isoform of the estrogen receptor (ERbeta).","conclusion":"Proestrous WT, but not betaERKO, mice had improved performance in the object recognition (greater percentage of time with novel object) and T-maze tasks (greater percentage of spontaneous alternations) and less anxiety-like behavior in the plus maze (increased duration on open arms) and mirror chamber task (increased duration in mirror) than did diestrous mice. This pattern was not seen in the rotarod, open field, or activity monitor, suggesting effects may be specific to affective and cognitive behavior, rather than motor behavior\/coordination. Thus, enhanced performance in cognitive tasks and anti-anxiety-like behavior of proestrous mice may require actions of ERbeta in the hippocampus and\/or cortex."},{"method":"Three groups of males were neonatally subjected to a gradient of androgen exposure (castrated plus injected oil (GxM+oil); castrated plus androstenedione treated (GxM+AND); and sham operated [CM]); a group of control females (CF) was also added.

This work studies the sexual morphological pattern of facilitatory and inhibitory structures that control lordosis.","conclusion":"The inhibition of lordosis in the males seems to be associated to the neonatal presence of testosterone and the consequent masculinization of the VMN, VMNvl, LSi and AOB. It is suggested that one of the functions of the sex differences consistently seen in these structures might be to inhibit the lordosis response in the male."},{"method":"Rats selected for high levels of impulsivity on a reaction time task analogous to the continuous performance test in humans exhibited correspondingly high levels of impulsive decision-making on a delay-of-reward task.

Mouse pups were reared under two different experimental conditions: standard nesting (SN, where single mother rears her pups) and CN (three females rearing their pups in a single nest). At adulthood CN and SN virgin females underwent three different behavioural tests: (i) maternal induction following presentation of foster pups; (ii) social recognition test in which ultrasound vocalizations (USVs) and social investigation behaviour emitted by a resident female in the presence of a female partner were recorded; (iii) zero-maze to analyze anxiety profiles.","background":"Communal nesting (CN), an early social enrichment procedure in which multiple females rear the offspring in a single nest, increases maternal care levels received by offspring and interaction with peers. It has been shown that male mice reared under CN conditions show increased social competence and propensity to social interactions at adulthood.","conclusion":"CN females showed (i) decreased licking response in the maternal induction test accompanied by an increased sniffing response; (ii) decreased of social interest towards a novel partner (during the Retest Different phase), and decreased USV emission rate in the social recognition test; CN and SN females did not differ in the emotional responses measured in the zero-maze apparatus.

This suggests that PBN lesions prevent transmission of critical CS and US information to forebrain regions for the processing of both aversive and safe taste memories. Unilateral asymmetrical lesions of PBN and IC blocked CTA acquisition as well as normal patterns of FLI in amygdala after novel CS-US pairing, an effect not seen when unilateral lesions were confined to a single hemisphere. The crossed-disconnection experiments provide compelling evidence that functional interactions between PBN and IC are required for CTA acquisition, but not for safe taste memory formation and retrieval. The dissociation between effects of the different types of lesions on safe and aversive taste memories supports emerging evidence that the neural underpinnings of the two types of taste learning differ."},{"method":"In order to ascertain whether BDNF modulates environmentally induced changes in exploratory behaviour, we examined mice carrying a deletion in one copy of the BDNF gene.

Exploratory behaviour was assessed in the open-field (OF) and hole-board (HB) test.

Environmental enrichment also led to an increase in dendritic spines in the hippocampal CA1 region and DG of the wild-type mice. This effect was also found in the enriched BDNF+\/- mice, but was less pronounced.

All groups treated with repeated administration of either drug or vehicle demonstrated novelty preference, and no differences were found in the measure of novelty investigation between the groups. Furthermore, this study reproduced findings showing significant differences in locomotor activity that did not coincide with differences in novelty-seeking behavior.

Baseline tail flick latencies (TFLs) did not change between any groups.","background":"We have previously shown gonadal steroid-dependent, gender specific modulation of nociception by alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. Agonist activation of the receptor enhances its association with spinophilin that antagonizes arrestin functions both by diminishing receptor phosphorylation by G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) and by competing for receptor interactions with arrestin. Since spinophilin is highly enriched in dendritic spines, we investigated whether alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-induced antinociception as well as sex-related differences are modified in spinophilin knockout mice.","conclusion":"Interestingly, the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine, increased TFL in male and diestrous (low estrogen) Sp(-\/-) as well as Sp(+\/+) mice; in fact, this increase in TFL was significantly higher in Sp(-\/-) male and diestrous groups than in their Sp(+\/+) counterparts. This unexpected finding is consistent with enhanced alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated sedation observed previously in Sp(-\/-) mice, presumably due to accelerated endocytosis of desensitized receptors and recycling of refreshed receptors when arrestin is not competed for by spinophilin in Sp(-\/-) mice. Despite modulation of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor effects in Sp(-\/-) mice, sex-related differences were retained; thus, clonidine was ineffective in proestrous females (highest estrogen levels), in both Sp(-\/-) and Sp(+\/+) mice, reaffirming that estrogen suppresses alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-evoked antinociception. These findings show that elimination of spinophilin enhances alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-evoked antinociception in estrogen-deprived physiological settings, suggesting a role for spinophilin to suppress these effects, and yet this enhanced response cannot overcome the absence of antinociception with elevated estrogen levels."},{"method":"Here we confirm this deficit in LTP and report that this strain of rat also displays impairments in long-term recognition memory when compared with normotensive controls. Further analysis of neurotrophin expression in dentate gyrus confirmed the previously-reported deficit in NGF and revealed a decrease in expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but not neurotrophin 3 (NT3) or neurotrophin 4 (NT4), in GH rats.

While the vomeronasal organ has long been considered an exclusively pheromonal organ, accumulating evidence indicates that it is not the sole channel for the transduction of pheromonal information and that both olfactory systems have been co-opted for the detection of different pheromone signals over the course of evolution. This has also led to great diversity in the vomeronasal and olfactory receptor families, with enormous levels of gene diversity and inactivation of genes in different species.","background":"Small-brained rodents have been the principle focus for pheromonal research and have provided comprehensive insights into the chemosensory mechanisms that underpin pheromonal communication and the hugely important roles that pheromones play in behavioural regulation. However, pheromonal communication does not start or end with the mouse and the rat, and work in amphibians reveals much about the likely evolutionary origins of the chemosensory systems that mediate pheromonal effects.","conclusion":"Finally, the evolution of trichromacy as well as huge increases in social complexity have minimised the role of pheromones in the lives of primates, leading to the total inactivation of the vomeronasal system in catarrhine primates while the brain increased in size and behaviour became emancipated from hormonal regulation."},{"method":"In addition, we have shown that tail suspension of the BTBR produces a heightened anxiety response in the elevated plus maze.","background":"This study shows that the BTBR T+tf\/J mouse, a model for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), has increased levels of the stress hormone corticosterone, when compared to C57BL\/6J mice.","conclusion":"These results suggest that the BTBR mouse is stressor-reactive exhibiting hormone responses that might predispose it to ASD."},{"method":"Rats were trained on a novel instrumental two-lever spatial discrimination and reversal learning task, measuring both 'cognitive flexibility' and constituent processes including response inhibition. Both levers were presented, only one of which was reinforced. The rat was required to respond on the reinforced lever under a fixed ratio 3 schedule of reinforcement. Following attainment of criterion, two reversals were introduced. Rats were then matched according to their reversal performance and subjected to bilateral excitotoxic OFC lesions. Following recovery, a series of four reversals was presented.","background":"We recently reported that orbitofrontal cortical (OFC) lesions impaired reversal learning of an instrumental two-lever spatial discrimination task, a deficit manifested as increased perseveration on the pre-potent response. Here we examine whether exposure to reversal learning test pre-operatively may have a beneficial effect for future reversal learning of OFC-lesioned animals.","conclusion":"OFC lesions impaired neither retention nor reversal phases. These data, together with the previously reported reversal deficit following OFC lesions, suggest that OFC is not needed when task experience has been gained but it is necessary when task demands are relatively high."},{"method":"Recent studies demonstrate that VGF, which is also a CREB-dependent gene, is upregulated by antidepressant drugs and voluntary exercise and is reduced in animal models of depression.","background":"The monoamine hypothesis of depression is increasingly called into question by newer theories that revolve around changes in neuronal plasticity, primarily in the hippocampus, at both the structural and the functional levels. Chronic stress negatively regulates hippocampal function while antidepressants ameliorate the effects of stress on neuronal morphology and activity. Both stress and antidepressants have been shown to affect levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) whose transcription is dependent on cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). BDNF itself has antidepressant-like actions and can induce transcription of a number of molecules. One class of genes regulated by both BDNF and serotonin (5-HT) are neuropeptides including VGF (non-acryonimic) which has a novel role in depression. Neuropeptides are important modulators of neuronal function but their role in affective disorders is just emerging.","conclusion":"VGF enhances hippocampal synaptic plasticity as well as neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus but the mechanisms of antidepressant-like actions of VGF in behavioral paradigms are not known. We summarize experimental data describing the roles of BDNF, VGF and other neuropeptides in depression and how they may be acting through the generation of new neurons and altered synaptic activity. Understanding the molecular and cellular changes that underlie the actions of neuropeptides and how these adaptations result in antidepressant-like effects will aid in developing drugs that target novel pathways for major depressive disorders."},{"method":"We evaluated whether or not mice that present higher vs. lower locomotor response after repeated treatment with ethanol display increased or decreased locomotor responses when challenged with methamphetamine or morphine, and vice versa.

According to the response presented during repeated drug treatment, mice were classified as HIGH or LOW activity groups. Locomotor activity was monitored after mice were challenged with saline, and 48 h later with a drug. Ethanol-treated mice were challenged with methamphetamine or morphine, methamphetamine- and morphine-treated animals were challenged with ethanol.","background":"Repeated administration of drugs may induce adaptations which affect the behavioral responses to the drug itself or to other drugs. Whether individual characteristics to repeated drug administration predict sensitivity to the effects of another drug is not clear.","conclusion":"After repeated treatment with ethanol or methamphetamine, locomotor sensitization was observed only in HIGH mice, not LOW mice. Ethanol-treated mice with HIGH activity showed sensitized, increased locomotor responses to methamphetamine (p&lt;0.05), but not to morphine. Locomotor responses to ethanol were not affected by a previous history of methamphetamine treatment. Although repeated administration of morphine failed to induce sensitization, morphine-treated mice with HIGH activity presented sensitized locomotor responses after an ethanol challenge.

Spontaneous locomotor activity of sdy\/sdy and sdy\/+ mice in novel environment was not significantly different from DBA\/2J controls. However, on repeated testing in the same environment for 7 days, sdy\/sdy mice, in contrast to DBA\/2J controls showed a lack of locomotor habituation. Locomotor activating effect of a low dose of d-amphetamine (2.5 mg\/kg i.p.), a behavioral measure of mesolimbic dopamine activity, was significantly reduced in the mutant mice. Interestingly, sdy\/sdy mice showed enhanced locomotor sensitization to repeated five daily injection of amphetamine. Possible cognitive impairment in Sandy mutants was revealed in novel object recognition test as sdy\/sdy and sdy\/+ mice spent significantly less time exploring novel objects compared to DBA\/2J. Sdy\/sdy mice also showed deficits in emotionally motivated learning and memory showing greater freezing response to auditory conditioned stimulus (CS) in fear conditioning paradigm. In thermal nociceptive test, the latency of paw withdrawal in sdy\/sdy and sdy\/+ animals was significantly higher compared to DBA\/2J indicating hypoalgesia in the mutants.","background":"Dysbindin-1 (dystrobrevin binding protein-1) has been reported as a candidate gene associated with schizophrenia. Dysbindin-1 mRNA and protein levels are significantly reduced in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of schizophrenia subjects.","conclusion":"Taken together, these data suggest that dysbindin-1 gene deficiency leads to significant changes in cognition and altered responses to psychostimulants."},{"method":"In one experiment, 30 rats were trained on a two-pair concurrent object discrimination task in an elevated radial arm maze. Rats with a perirhinal cortex lesion needed significantly more days to attain the criterion in the relearning of a pre-operatively acquired object discrimination task than the control rats and rats with a hippocampal lesion. However, there were no significant differences between the three groups in the days to attain the criterion in learning post-operatively the original object discrimination task with new discriminanda and its relearning. The rats with a hippocampal lesion did not show any impairment in object discrimination. In a second experiment, 27 rats were trained on a place discrimination task in the same maze. Rats with a hippocampal lesion required more days to attain the criterion than the control rats to relearn the pre-operatively acquired place discrimination task, and they had fewer correct responses in the first three sessions with new discriminanda than the control rats. Rats with a perirhinal cortex lesion, on the other hand, showed mild relearning impairment.","background":"The present study was designed to determine the degree of functional dissociation between the rat perirhinal cortex and hippocampus for reference memory performance on object and place discrimination tasks.","conclusion":"These results suggest that there is a functionally single dissociation between the perirhinal cortex and hippocampus for reference memory performance on object and place discrimination tasks. They also suggest the possible involvement of the perirhinal cortex in spatial reference memory performance."},{"method":"In the present experiment, we tested for hemispheric asymmetry of the middle-temporal complex (V5\/MT), which is a key-component of the visual motion network, by using rTMS applied over left or right V5\/MT during a visual trajectory perception task.","background":"Inconsistent observations have been reported in the literature regarding the asymmetrical contribution of higher visual areas of the left and right hemispheres to visual motion processing.","conclusion":"The results showed that the effect of rTMS was to enhance individual hemispheric asymmetries present when the test was performed without rTMS.

Water-maze training induced greater increases in plasma corticosterone than did Barnes maze training, assessed 30 min after the final session.","background":"The effects of abnormally high or low stress on learning are well established. The Barnes maze and Morris water maze are two commonly used tests of spatial memory, of which the water maze is considered more stressful; however, until now this has not been demonstrated empirically.","conclusion":"Importantly, spatial learning was inversely correlated with corticosterone levels in the water maze but not the Barnes maze, suggesting that performance on the water maze may be more affected by test-induced stress even within wild-type subjects of the same age and gender. These findings are important when considering the appropriate cognitive tasks for any experiment in which stress responses may differ systematically across groups."},{"method":"Cognitive performance was assessed in male C57BL\/6J mice using two learning tasks: the water maze (WM) and circular hole board (CHB). Sugar was chosen as a post-training reinforcer. We expected that the free access to sugar immediately (0 h) after training would facilitate spatial memory; delayed access to sugar (4h after training) or no sugar served as controls.","background":"Spatial memory can be strengthened by adverse stimuli that activate the stress system, and administration of the stress hormone corticosterone in close-context with the learning task. Less is known about modulation of spatial memory by post-training positive reinforcers (reward).","conclusion":"In both tasks, 0 h sugar mice showed superior performance, indicated by shorter latencies and distances to the trained spatial location. The memory facilitating effect of sugar became visible at distinct times during training: on the CHB from the first trial onwards, in the WM on training days 4 and 5. Sugar-rewarded mice kept their superior performance during the free exploration\/swim trial, expressed by more persistent search strategies for the exit hole or platform. Post-training sugar reward in close-context with performance strengthens memory via modulation of consolidation. This finding supports the integrative theory of reinforcement and memory.

However, in rats receiving rewarding electrical stimulation via lateral hypothalamic (LH) electrodes, elevated DA tone in the NAc terminal field was detected via microdialysis for up to 2h, even when short (1.5s) inter-train intervals were employed.","conclusion":"The results resemble those obtained by means of microdialysis in rats receiving LH stimulation but differed from the prior FSCV data. Although the concentration of DA in dialysate obtained from NAc probes did fall after having peaked at the 30 min mark, this decline set in much later than in the FSCV studies, and elevated DA tone could still be detected after 110 min of self-stimulation. The stimulation-induced peak in DA tone could be restored by a 30 min rest period, a manipulation that was ineffective previously in restoring the FSCV measure of phasic release. These findings are discussed in terms of the differential sensitivity of the FSCV and microdialysis methods to phasic and tonic signaling by DA neurons and to different transitions between their activity states."},{"method":"We therefore examined the effects of local 5-HT depletion in the amygdala on psychotomimetic drug-induced locomotor hyperactivity and prepulse inhibition, two animal model of aspects of schizophrenia. Pentobarbital-anaesthetized (60 mg\/kg, i.p.) male Sprague-Dawley rats were stereotaxically micro-injected with 0.5 microl of a 5 microg\/mul solution of the 5-HT neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) into either the basolateral (BLA) or central nucleus of amygdala (CeN). Two weeks after the surgery, rats with BLA lesions did not show changes in either psychotomimetic drug-induced locomotor hyperactivity or prepulse inhibition. In contrast, rats with CeN lesions showed significant disruption of prepulse inhibition, but no changes in psychotomimetic drug-induced locomotor hyperactivity. Neurochemical analysis and autoradiographic labelling of 5-HT transporter sites showed that a good degree of anatomical selectivity was obtained.","background":"While there is abundant evidence for a role of 5-HT and the amygdala in anxiety and depression, the role of 5-HT in this brain region in schizophrenia is less well understood.","conclusion":"Following administration of 5,7-DHT into the amygdala, the concentration of 5-HT was significantly reduced. Similarly, 5-HT transporter autoradiographs showed differential and selective lesions of 5-HT innervation in targeted subregions of the amygdala. These results provide evidence for differential involvement of 5-HT projections within the amygdala in prepulse inhibition but not locomotor hyperactivity. Thus, the present study supports the view that 5-HT in the amygdala may be involved in aspects of schizophrenia and a target for antipsychotic drug action."},{"method":"We investigated whether rats continuously infused with thiorphan, a specific inhibitor for neprilysin, into the cerebral ventricle cause cognitive dysfunction, with an accumulation of Abeta in the brain.","background":"An accumulation of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) due to an imbalance between anabolism and catabolism triggers Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neprilysin is a rate-limiting peptidase, which participates in the catabolism of Abeta in brain.","conclusion":"Thiorphan-infused rats displayed significant cognitive dysfunction in the ability to discriminate in the object recognition test and spatial memory in the water maze test, but not in other hippocampus-dependent learning and memory tasks. Thiorphan infusion also elevated the Abeta40 level in the insoluble fraction of the cerebral cortex, but not that of the hippocampus. There was no significant difference in the nicotine-stimulated release of acetylcholine in the hippocampus between vehicle- and thiorphan-infused rats. These results indicate that continuous infusion of thiorphan into the cerebral ventricle causes cognitive dysfunction by raising the level of Abeta in the cerebral cortex, and suggest that a reduction of neprilysin activity contribute to the deposition of Abeta and development of AD."},{"method":"We assessed corticospinal excitability during motor imagery of a thumb-palm opposition movement by recording potentials evoked by TMS from two hand muscles that would (opponens pollicis, OP, target) or would not (abductor digiti minimi, ADM, control) be activated during actual performance of the very same movement. Participants were asked to imagine the thumb-palm opposition movement while maintaining first person imagery that was either purely visual or predominately kinesthetic. The motor imagery task was performed in two conditions in which the imagined and the actual hand could be either congruent or incongruent.","background":"Single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to test the assumption that kinesthetic imagery of action is more 'motor' than visual imagery of action.","conclusion":"Facilitation of potentials recorded from OP was higher during imagery carried out in mentally congruent than incongruent postures. This effect was largely due to lack of excitability recorded during incongruent kinesthetic imagery, which was indistinguishable from baseline imagery of the static hand. All other conditions differed from static imagery regardless of position. No significant effects were found in a control muscle (ADM) thus indicating that the effect was not related to spatial coding. Subjective reports obtained after the experiment indicate that the results cannot be ascribed to qualitative differences in the imagery experienced. For relatively simple motor tasks requiring no 'expertise' we found no detectable difference in the motor cortex due to imagery modality."},{"method":"Compared to female control mice, Hdc(-\/-) female mice showed hypoactivity, increased measures of anxiety, impairments in water-maze performance, but enhanced passive avoidance memory retention. Following behavioral testing, arginine vasopression (AVP) immunoreactivity was higher in the dorsal hypothalamus and central and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala of Hdc(-\/-) than Hdc(+\/+) mice. Finally, MAP2 immunoreactivity in the hippocampal CA1 region correlated positively with measures of anxiety in the open-field and light-dark tests and negatively with performance during the hidden sessions of the water-maze.","background":"The role of histamine in brain function has been studied using histidine decarboxylase (HDC) deficient male mice. As the effects of HDC deficiency on brain function might be sex-dependent, we behaviorally analyzed Hdc(-\/-) and control female mice.","conclusion":"As the effects of HDC deficiency on object recognition, water-maze, and rotorod performance, were sex-dependent, it is important to consider potential effects of sex in the interpretation of the role of histaminergic neurotransmission in brain function."},{"method":"Male Sprague-Dawley rats were stereotaxically implanted with bilateral cannula into either the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or the nucleus accumbens (Nacc).

Following a 2-week withdrawal period, rats received a final injection of cocaine in the absence of nicotinic antagonist to test for sensitization.","background":"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are known to play a role in several aspects of cocaine addiction. Recently, systemic administration of the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine was shown to block the induction of long-term locomotor sensitization to cocaine. Behavioral sensitization being a model of long-term neuroadaptations to chronic cocaine exposure, the goal of the current study was to identify the anatomical localization, as well as the nature, of the nicotinic receptors involved.","conclusion":"When microinjected into the VTA, DHbetaE, but not MLA, prevented the induction of behavioral sensitization to cocaine. In contrast, behavioral sensitization was present in rats receiving DHbetaE microinjections into the Nacc. Neither antagonist, whether injected into the VTA or the Nacc had any significant effect on the acute locomotor response to cocaine. Given the subtype selectivity of the nicotinic antagonists employed, heteromeric beta2-containing (beta2*) nAChRs, but not homomeric alpha7* nAChRs, in the VTA may be involved in the neuroadaptive changes underlying cocaine sensitization."},{"method":"The VC-lesioned and control groups (n=5, 5) were near identical in PPF for flashes presented 5-20 ms before the ASR and near identical in PPI for flashes presented 60 ms before the ASR.","background":"We studied the inhibitory (PPI) and facilitatory (PPF) behavioural effects of brief light flashes presented as prepulses just prior to the acoustic startle reflex (ASR) in intact rats and in rats that had a bilateral excision of visual cortex (VC).","conclusion":"These findings differ from those of a case report of a human patient following occipital cortex resection, for whom light flashes failed to produce either acoustic startle PPF or PPI if the flash were presented to the portion of the visual field in which she could not see; they differ also from data obtained in functionally decorticate rats, for which a light flash produced no startle PPI, but instead a late-appearing exaggerated PPF. In the present experiment the lesion was restricted to VC, while in contrast the occipital resection in the human patient included posterior areas of the parietal and temporal lobe, and functional decortication in the rat disengaged the entire cortex. The greater extent of these two effective surgical procedures may have been responsible for their greater behavioural effects; otherwise, the complete loss of reflex control by photic stimulation in the human patient but not in the rat may reflect the greater functional importance and anatomical complexity of the VC in humans."},{"method":"In the present study, identification of risky as opposed to safe areas is based on the retrieval behavior in lactating females and hoarding of food pellets in food-deprived males.

The corticosterone response to a stress condition was examined at several intervals after 5,7-DHT treatment.","background":"Previous studies with acute tryptophan depletion, leading to transient central 5-HT reductions, showed no effects on affective behavior but impaired object memory.","conclusion":"The substantial reduction in neuronal 5-HT markers in the dorsal raphe did not affect anxiety-related, depressive-like or impulsive behavior. Compared to the SHAM group, the lesioned rats showed a lower response latency to obtain a reward, indicating a quick and accurate reaction to a stimulus. No differences were found in the progressive ratio test for food motivation. A marked impairment in object recognition was found. The 5,7-DHT treatment did not affect the corticosterone response to a stressful situation. Overall, these results corroborate studies with acute tryptophan depletion suggesting a role of 5-HT in object memory, but not affective behavior."},{"method":"We tested social interactions in male mice from three inbred strains: C57BL\/6J (B6), BALB\/cJ (C) and DBA\/2J (D2).

Behavioural testing started at postnatal day 70. Rats were tested for locomotor activity (open field), anxiety (elevated plus maze), social behaviour (conditioned place preference for cage-mates), reward-related operant behaviour [progressive ratio (PR)] and spatial learning (four-arm baited eight-arm radial maze task). Nissl-stained sections revealed considerable regeneration of much of the lesioned tissue in the mPFC, however, with disturbed cytoarchitecture.","background":"According to the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia, early brain damage renders the brain vulnerable to adverse effects during puberty, which precipitate the disease in young adults. Animal models can be used to test this hypothesis.","conclusion":"Locomotor activity was increased by neonatal lesions but reduced after pubertal PCP-treatment. Neonatal lesions alone increased operant behaviour in the PR-test and reduced anxiety in the elevated plus maze. In contrast, PCP-treatment disturbed social behaviour while neonatal lesions had no effect. Different aspects of leaning and memory in the radial maze task were independently disturbed after neonatal lesions and PCP-treatment.

In the first experiment, MK-801 (0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg\/kg, i.p.) was given 30 min prior to the testing. Beginning the dose of 0.05 mg\/kg the drug increased locomotion and impaired alternation performance. An ability of animals to enter subsequently three or four different arms was reduced significantly. In the second experiment, the dose of 0.05 mg\/kg was chosen as the lowest possible dose of MK-801 producing marked behavioural impairment. KYNA (0.3, 3 and 30 mg\/kg, s.c.) was administered 60 min prior to the MK-801.","background":"The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of pharmacological modulation of the NMDA receptors on spontaneous alternation behaviour.","conclusion":"While all KYNA doses prevented hyperlocomotion, only the highest dose (30 mg\/kg) maintained alternation score at the control levels, i.e. the KYNA plus MK-801 treated animals alternated regularly three or four different arms.

Brain tissue and dialysates were analyzed to provide the first profile of changes in ECF levels of ascorbate (AA), glutathione (GSH) and urate during hibernation and the transition to cenothermia.","background":"Warming from hibernation to cenothermia involves intense metabolic activity coincident with large fluxes in blood flow and is considered to be a period of oxidative stress during which utilization of endogenous antioxidants prevents pathology.","conclusion":"Brain tissue content of AA and GSH was unchanged between hibernation and cenothermia; however, arousal was associated with substantial oxidation of AA from the brain ECF and plasma compartments. ECF GSH increased during arousal. Brain tissue urate content was decreased 50% during hibernation. ECF urate levels were unchanged in hibernation and cenothermia but transiently increased 100% during arousal.

The second experiment explored the role of visual feedback about the arm's position on the participants' ability to adapt after the perturbation had occurred.","background":"Two experiments were conducted to examine the human ability to adapt to a perturbation in a synchronization task. Five experimental signal conditions were tested using random-dot kinematograms, representing four conditions with different coherence levels (100%, 50%, 30% and 10%) and one target-alone condition. Within one trial, increasing or decreasing the frequency of the sinusoidally moving signal dots abruptly in the midst of each trial provoked a perturbation.","conclusion":"The results clearly demonstrated that the synchronization performance gradually declined in function of the increasing number of randomly moving noise dots. In the 50% coherence condition, the participants were not or only partially able to adjust their arm movements to the new frequency situation. In addition, the provision of enhanced visual feedback about the arm's failed to improve one's adaptive ability.

The differentiation in competition-performance among cage mates was not paralleled by a difference in performance in the elevated zero-maze or in plasma corticosterone levels in any of the three strains.

However, during the dark phase Y2 and Y4 receptor knockout mice drank significantly more (46-63%, P&lt;0.05) water than the control mice. The total daily water intake over 24 h was also enhanced. The enhanced water intake during the dark phase was not altered by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol or the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist telmisartan (each injected intraperitoneally at 10 mg\/kg). These data indicate that NPY acting via Y2 and Y4 receptors plays a distinctive role in the regulation of nocturnal water consumption.

Behaviorally, all animals learned to perform the water maze task over time but the ischemia SC rats had the worst performance overall while all the EC housed animals demonstrated the best performance in general. Regression analysis showed that increase MAP2 expression was able to explain some of the variance in the behavioral parameters in the water maze suggesting that this cytoskeletal protein probably played a role in mediating enhanced functional outcomes."},{"method":"Rats were divided into eight groups and bilaterally cannulated into CA1 region of the hippocampus.

These networks are activated by tonic input from the reticular formation in the brainstem. Under more challenging conditions, such as walking on a horizontal ladder, successful locomotion relies upon additional context dependent input from pathways such as the cortico- and rubro-spinal tracts.","conclusion":"We found that the placement of a hind limb on a rung precisely followed the placement of the ipsilateral fore limb. This is different to normal walking where the hind limb is placed behind the position of the ipsilateral fore limb. The increased reach of the hind limbs is achieved by increased flexion of the hip and rotation of the pelvis during the swing phase. Electromyographic observations showed decreased burst duration in Tibialis anterior an ankle flexor muscle. Further changes in the muscle activity pattern were likely due to the reduced stepping frequency during ladder walking. Following a lesion of the dorsal column, containing major parts of the corticospinal tract, we found an increased number of stepping errors and changes in the stepping strategy. The step length of the fore limbs was reduced and the hind limbs were frequently positioned on rungs other than those occupied by the fore limb."},{"method":"The purpose of this experiment was to determine the extent to which the effects of CORT on depression-like behavior depend on (1) the dose-injected and (2) the duration of treatment.

Such procedures are necessary to investigate disorders in which cognitive inhibitory mechanisms are known to be deficient, e.g., schizophrenia. In healthy participants, individual differences in the tendency to show conditioned inhibition should be related to personality measures of cognitive inhibition.","conclusion":"Conditioned inhibition was reliable across two alternative test variants, in which the non-occurrence of the US was specified differently, and was confirmed by summation tests. The level of CI shown was positively associated with BAS Reward Responsiveness but did not correlate significantly with any of the other BIS\/BAS scales.

In addition, the personality trait of psychoticism (tough-mindedness) was related to defensive intensity with low scorers on psychoticism being more sensitive to threat in general and high scorers being more threat insensitive.

In contrast, trace conditioning, in which the CS and US are temporally separate, is thought to reflect declarative memory. Hippocampal lesions impair acquisition and expression of trace conditioning measured by the conditioned freezing and eyeblink responses, while having little effect on the acquisition of delay conditioning. Recent evidence suggests that lesions of the ventral hippocampus (VH) impair conditioned fear under conditions in which dorsal hippocampal (DH) lesions have little effect.","conclusion":"We found that both delay- and trace-conditioned rats displayed significant FPS near the end of the CS relative to the unpaired control group. In contrast, trace-conditioned rats displayed significant FPS throughout the duration of the trace interval, whereas FPS decayed rapidly to baseline after CS offset in delay-conditioned rats. In experiment 2, both DH and VH lesions were found to significantly reduce the overall magnitude of FPS compared to the control group, however, no differences were found between the DH and VH groups. These findings support a role for both the DH and VH in trace fear conditioning, and suggest that the greater effect of VH lesions on conditioned fear might be specific to certain measures of fear."},{"method":"This paper presents a feasible way to reinstate extinguished methamphetamine (METH)-seeking behavior.

A combination of non-contingent intravenous (i.v.) priming and self-injected METH also increased the reinstatement of METH-seeking behavior in the absence of METH-paired stimuli (cue- and hole-lamps) and without METH infusion posterior to the self-injection.

In Experiment 2, infection in juvenile rats did not lead to LPS-induced memory impairment in adulthood, suggesting there is a critical period for early infection-induced alterations. In Experiments 3 and 4, memory for a novel context was impaired in neonatally infected rats, a task that is dependent on the hippocampus, whereas cued memory for a tone, which does not depend on the hippocampus, was not impaired. Furthermore, long-term, but not short-term contextual memory was impaired in adult rats infected as neonates following an LPS challenge either 24 h before or immediately after conditioning. Finally, in Experiment 5, no neonatal group differences were observed in corticosterone or open field behaviour, suggesting that decreased freezing to a conditioned context reflects impaired memory, and not simply hyperactivity or altered stress reactivity.","background":"We have reported that exposure to bacteria (Escherichia coli) during the neonatal period in rats is associated with impaired memory for a novel context in adulthood. However, impairment is only observed if a peripheral immune challenge (bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) is administered immediately following context exposure.

We also recorded the electrocorticogram (ECoG) to determine the arousal response during yawning. Microinjection of l-glutamate (2-5 nmol) into the PVN produced a frequent yawning accompanied by an arousal shift in the ECoG, and these behavioral effects were associated with a significant increase of c-Fos positive CRF neurons in the medial parvocellular subdivision of the PVN.","background":"Our previous studies have suggested that activation of the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) descending oxytocinergic projections is involved in the induction of yawning accompanied by an arousal response, but the possibility that neural systems other than the oxytocinergic system in the PVN also mediate the arousal\/yawning response cannot be ruled out.","conclusion":"In addition, a marked enhancement in the c-Fos expression was found in the both locus coeruleus (LC) and global area in the cortex when the frequency of yawning response was increased by the PVN stimulation, suggesting that the arousal response during yawning might be mediated by the activation of LC neurons. The present study suggests that an activation of CRF neurons in the PVN is responsible for the arousal response accompanied by yawning behavior."},{"method":"Here, we propose a novel experiment to address this question.

We compared subjects' estimations of the stimulus vanishing or final positions after biological and after non-biological motion displays.","background":"How do we extrapolate the final position of hand trajectory that suddenly vanishes behind a wall? Studies showing maintenance of cortical activity after objects in motion disappear suggest that internal model of action may be recalled to reconstruct the missing part of the trajectory. Although supported by neurophysiological and brain imaging studies, behavioural evidence for this hypothesis is sparse. Further, in humans, it is unknown if the recall of internal model of action at motion observation can be tuned with kinematic features of movement.","conclusion":"Subjects systematically overestimated the vanishing and final position for the two directions (up and down) and the two kinematics displayed (biological and non-biological). However, estimation of the final position decreased in precision and increased in variability for movements that violated the kinematic laws of arm pointing task. The results suggest that motion inference does not rely only upon visual extrapolating mechanisms based on past visual trajectory information. We propose that motion estimation relies on internal models that contain specific kinematic details of vertical arm movement, which can be rapidly recalled during motion observation."},{"method":"Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) was used to compare patterns of brain activation after pairing CS taste and US drug using bottle and IO methods.","background":"Conditioned taste aversions (CTAs) can be established by exposing rats to a novel taste CS through a bottle or through intra-oral (IO) infusion. Lesion studies suggest differences between the two methods in their engagement of brain circuits, as excitotoxic amygdala lesions have no effect on bottle-conditioned CTAs, but eliminate CTAs produced using IO infusion.","conclusion":"Conditioning rats using the bottle method was associated with widespread elevations in FLI throughout the putative CTA circuit (basolateral and central nuclei of amygdala, insular cortex and nucleus of the solitary tract). In contrast, IO conditioning led to activation only in the central nucleus of amygdala. This supports the suggestion of differences in aversion processing as a function of conditioning method and may explain the greater reliance on amygdala of IO-conditioned CTAs due to engagement of a less distributed neural network."},{"method":"Place cells were recorded while rats solved a spatial working memory task in light and dark testing conditions.","background":"This study examined the relationship between hippocampal place fields and spatial working memory.","conclusion":"Rats made significantly more errors when tested in darkness, and although place fields changed in multiple ways in darkness, only changes in place field specificity predicted the degree of impaired spatial memory.

To examine the neural circuitry responsible for integration of internal and external determinants of human eating behaviour, brain responses to visual and complex gustatory food-related stimuli were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging in 18 healthy non-smokers (10 women, 8 men). Each individual was studied on two occasions, the order of which was counterbalanced; after eating as usual and after 24 h fasting.","conclusion":"No circuitry was identified as differentially responsive in fasting compared to satiety to both visual and gustatory food-related stimuli. The left insula response to the gustatory stimuli was stronger during fasting. The inferior occipito-temporal response to visual food-related stimuli also tended to be stronger during fasting. The responses in the occipito-temporal cortex to visual and in the insula to gustatory stimuli were stronger in women than in men. There was no interaction between gender and fasting. In conclusion, food reactivity in modality-specific sensory cortical areas is modulated by internal motivational states. The stronger reactivity to external food-related stimuli in women may be explored as a marker of gender-related susceptibility to eating disorders."},{"method":"To assess this role, we recorded fore and hind limb-related pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) in the cat during postural corrections and during locomotion; hind limb PTNs were also tested during scratching.","background":"Neuronal mechanisms of the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebellum play a key role in the control of complex automatic motor behaviors-postural corrections, stepping, and scratching, whereas the role of the motor cortex is less clear.","conclusion":"The activity of nearly all PTNs was modulated in the rhythm of each of these motor patterns. The discharge frequency, averaged over the PTN population, was similar in different motor tasks, whereas the degree of frequency modulation was larger during locomotion. In individual PTNs, a correlation between analogous discharge characteristics (frequency or its modulation) in different tasks was very low, suggesting that input signals to PTNs in these tasks have a substantially different origin. In about a half of PTNs, their activity in different tasks was timed to the analogous (flexor\/extensor) parts of the cycle, suggesting that these PTNs perform similar functions in these tasks (e.g., control of the value of muscle activity). In another half of PTNs, their activity was timed to opposite parts of the cycle in different tasks. These PTNs seem to perform different motor functions in different tasks, or their targets are active in different parts of the cycle in these tasks, or their effects are not directly related to the control of motor output (e.g., they modulate transmission of afferent signals)."},{"method":"In this study we investigated, in adolescent male rat offspring, the consequences of a single, intense prenatal stress induced by a 120 min-maternal immobilization at gestational day 16, and of a daily, brief maternal separation from postnatal day 2 until 21, on: unconditioned fear\/anxiety-like behaviour in open field and in elevated plus-maze; learning performance in the \"Can test\", a non-aversive spatial and tactile\/visual task; corticosterone plasma levels under basal and stress-induced conditions.","background":"Perinatal manipulations can lead to neurobehavioural changes in the progeny.","conclusion":"Our results indicate that both prenatal stress and maternal separation procedures decrease emotionality and enhance learning performance. Maternal separation potentiates prenatal stress-induced effects in enhancing learning performance. Both basal and stress-induced corticosterone plasma levels are reduced following prenatal stress, maternal separation and the combination of two procedures. These findings suggest that a single, intense prenatal stress can enhance the adaptive stress-related responses in the progeny, probably due to the involvement of maternal factors.

An early positive wave starting at about 50 ms after saccade offset and originating in the posterior parietal cortex contralateral to saccade direction probably reflects the integration of saccade-related and visual information and thus the updating process. A shift of the representation of the to-be-updated stimulus to the opposite hemisphere is reflected in a later component starting approximately 400 ms after saccade offset, which is related to memory and originates in the PPC ipsilateral to saccade direction and thus contralateral to the spatial location of the updated visual stimulus."},{"method":"On each trial, an object covered a baited food well in one of 15 spatial locations along a row of food wells perpendicular to the start box.

On the ensuing choice phase, the animal was allowed to choose between the two objects. The object that covered the same food well as the object in the sample phase was the correct choice and the second foil object was the incorrect choice.

No differences between the strains were observed when rats were trained on a discrimination reversal where the CS(+) and CS(-) levers were reversed or during a negative auto-maintenance phase where CS(+) lever contacts cancelled food delivery. Potential physiological mechanisms that might mediate the present results, including strain differences in HPA axis and monoamine neurotransmitter activity, are discussed. The finding that LEW (as compared to F344 rats) more readily acquire autoshaping and perform more responses is consistent with research indicating that LEW rats behave more impulsively and more readily self-administer drugs of abuse."},{"method":"The contexts used were the open-field test (OFT), a novel environment with no explicit threats present, and the defensive-burying test (DB), a habituated environment into which a threat has been introduced.

Both schizophrenia groups regardless of violence history exhibited increased lateral ventricle volume, while the schizophrenia group with violent history showed further abnormalities including reduced whole brain and hippocampal volumes and increased putamen size. The findings suggest that individuals with antisocial personality disorder as well as those with schizophrenia and a history of violence have common neural abnormalities, but also show neuro-anatomical differences. The processes by which they came to apparently common ground may, however, differ. The finding of temporal lobe reductions prevalent among those with antisocial personality disorder and hippocampal reduction in the violent men with schizophrenia contributes support for the importance of this region in mediating violent behaviour."},{"method":"In experiment 1, simple conditioning was studied using either a training procedure allowing overshadowing of the contextual cues by signalling footshock with a discrete tone or a training procedure allowing a reduction of this overshadowing by explicitly unpairing the footshock and the tone. In experiment 2, contextual discrimination and contextual occasion-setting were assessed. Rats were daily exposed to two different contexts. In one context, a footshock was delivered 30s after the offset of a tone, whereas in the other context the same tone was presented alone. Experiment 3 examined familiarization to a new context.","background":"This study aimed at investigating the effects of environmental enrichment on various aspects of contextual processing in adult female rats.","conclusion":"Experiment 1 showed that environmental enrichment reduced the overshadowing of contextual cues by the tone and also reduced freezing to the more predictive cue according to the training procedure used. Experiment 2 showed that environmental enrichment increased the ability of rats to discriminate two contexts. Experiment 3 showed that enriched rats familiarized faster to a new context than standard rats. Taken together, these results suggest that environmental enrichment in adult rats enhances learning about contextual cues and reduces overall fear associated with aversive events."},{"method":"In the present study, the time-course for development of this deficit after injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the striatum is determined using the corridor test. The ability of the dopamine receptor agonist, apomorphine, to reverse this impairment is also assessed.","background":"The corridor test is a newly developed test of sensorimotor integration that depends on a rat's ability to retrieve food from either side of its body. Rats with unilateral dopamine-depleting lesions neglect food on the contralateral side of their bodies, and selectively retrieve from the ipsilateral side.","conclusion":"Lesioned rats developed an impairment in contralateral retrieval that was evident within a day (and stable for up to 2 weeks) after lesion surgery. Systemic injection of apomorphine significantly ameliorated this deficit, and restored the rats' ability to collect food from both sides of their bodies. This study confirms that the corridor test is highly sensitive to dysfunction of the nigrostriatal dopamine system, and suggests that it might be a useful tool for screening pharmacological approaches to the treatment of Parkinson's disease."},{"method":"Resulting deficits were assessed using established sensorimotor tests conducted on each rat before and after the ET-1-induced infarct.

The same sensorimotor tests showed no deficits in surgical-control rats. The present model of white matter infarct should be valuable in examining the underlying mechanisms of subcortical ischemic stroke and to evaluate potential therapeutic interventions."},{"method":"WM performance and plasticity were measured in 27-month-old rats from EE and SE.","background":"In aged rodents, neuronal plasticity decreases while spatial learning and working memory (WM) deficits increase.

Cytosolic NOS activity was 128 and 155% higher in EE male and female rats, respectively. Mitochondrial NOS activity and expression were also significantly higher in EE male and female rats. Mitochondrial NOS protein expression was higher in brain submitochondrial membranes from EE reared rats. Complex I activity was 70-80% increased in EE as compared to SE rats.

In contrast, dizocilpine ((+)MK-801), an antagonist of excitatory amino acid receptors of the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) subtype, given into the paraventricular nucleus reduced penile erection, but was ineffective on the glutamic acid increase induced by the CB1 receptor antagonist. 6-Cyano-7-nitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and (+\/-)-2-amino-4-phosphono-butanoic acid (AP(4)), antagonists of the excitatory amino acid receptors of the AMPA subtype and of the metabotropic subtype, respectively, were ineffective on both penile erection and glutamic acid increase.

In the hole-board test, only animals classified as anxious displayed an obvious response to the anxiolytic drug diazepam (0.5mg\/kg). Finally in the forced-swimming test, the three groups demonstrated a similar immobility time, suggesting that the operated segregation was not depending on a helpless component. It is proposed that the selection of mice from a combination of either elevated plus-maze and black and white compartments tests or a combination of hole-board test and black and white compartments test, allows to distinguish high or low anxiety animals among a population of mice."},{"method":"Female hooded-Lister rats were trained to respond for food using an operant reversal-learning paradigm.

Previous studies in this laboratory have shown a selective reversal-learning deficit following acute PCP administration, a deficit that is attenuated by atypical, but not classical, antipsychotic treatment. However, acute PCP has limitations for modelling the chronic psychotic illness and persistent cognitive deficits observed in many schizophrenic patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the cognitive deficit induced by PCP over a longer term using a previously established operant reversal-learning procedure. Moreover, the efficacy of the atypical antipsychotics clozapine, ziprasidone and olanzapine to reverse the sub-chronic PCP deficit was compared with that of the classical antipsychotics, haloperidol and chlorpromazine.","conclusion":"PCP induced a significant impairment in the reversal phase relative to the initial phase of the task. Acute ziprasidone (2.5mg\/kg), olanzapine (1.5mg\/kg) and clozapine (5mg\/kg) produced a significant attenuation of the impairment induced by sub-chronic PCP in the reversal phase. In marked contrast to these effects, acute administration of the classical agents haloperidol (0.05 mg\/kg) and chlorpromazine (2mg\/kg) failed to significantly reverse the PCP-induced cognitive impairment.

There was no eye-closure bias in the pattern of Mo-Un sleep (one eye shut and the other open) in chicks of both sexes. On day 2, chicks subjected to the removal of imprinting object showed less time and number of episodes of binocular sleep than control chicks and chicks subjected to changes of imprinting object.","background":"The pattern of monocular\/unihemispheric sleep (Mo-Un sleep) was studied behaviourally in male and female chicks after early post-hatching changes of the imprinting object.","conclusion":"There was no eye-closure bias in control chicks whilst a significant bias for more right Mo-Un sleep was recorded in chicks after removal and changes of imprinting object of both sexes. It is suggested that the removal or changes of imprinting object would cause a decrease of binocular sleep and trigger processes associated to secondary imprinting involving the left hemisphere. The bias for more right Mo-Un sleep (right eye-closure) could be the by-product of consolidation processes of secondary imprinting memories in the left hemisphere and\/or of more left eye-opening as a result of periodical awakening of right hemisphere to control the environment after a stressful condition such as the removal or change of imprinting object."},{"method":"We examined the effect of music exposure during the perinatal period on learning behavior in adult mice, and measured the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB), which play critical roles in synaptic plasticity.

However, the physiological and molecular mechanism of this effect remains unclear.","conclusion":"Music-exposed mice completed a maze learning task with fewer errors than the white noise-exposed mice and had lower levels of BDNF and higher levels of TrkB and PDK1 in the cortex. MAPK levels were unchanged. Furthermore, TrkB and PDK1 protein levels in the cortex showed a significant negative correlation with the number of errors on the maze. These results suggest that perinatal exposure of mice to music has an influence on BDNF\/TrkB signaling and its intracellular signaling pathway targets, including PDK1, and thus may induce improved learning and memory functions."},{"method":"Pigmented as well as albino rats could distinguish a fully coherently moving pattern from dynamic noise.","background":"Motion perception was tested in pigmented Long-Evans and albino Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus sp.) using moving random dot patterns.","conclusion":"However, motion coherence thresholds were significantly lower in pigmented compared to albino rats (12% and 30% coherence, respectively).

This increase was attenuated in the PMd, DRN and dlPAG by i.c.v. injection of AP7 (5 nmol\/2 microl), an NMDA receptor antagonist. The drug increased the percentage of time the rats remained close to the cat in the observation box. The results suggest that exposure to a live predator activates neurons containing NOS in brain areas related to defensive reactions.

These deficits are attributed to a disruption of the reward comparison mechanism that computes the value of the current reward relative to the expected reward. Instrumental successive negative contrast (iSNC), which occurs following a surprising reduction in the magnitude of a solid food reward, is also keyed off the detection of a disparity between the value of the expected and actual rewards.","conclusion":"In Experiment 1, both GT-lesioned and neurologically intact rats trained with 10 food pellets and shifted to one food pellet showed a significant iSNC effect. In Experiment 2, the same GT-lesioned rats failed to show cSNC when shifted from 1.0M sucrose to 0.15% sodium saccharin.

Previous studies have also found that application of an electrical current to the surface of brain tissue generates such slow potential shifts.","conclusion":"A current-dependent increase in prey-catching activities occurred with dc currents from 0.1 to 500 micro A and in avoidance behaviours from 50 to 500 micro A. There is also evidence of additivity of dc and visually induced negativity increasing some behaviours. The dc current was applied in order to start a movement of ions through the brain structure but more specifically through radial glia. The resulting flux of ions is thought to be responsible for the recorded slow potential shift associated with motivation and these experiments hopefully shed further light on the possible neuromodulatory role played by radial glia through the spatial buffering of potassium and the associated slow potential shifts."},{"method":"Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of L-serine (0.21, 0.42 and 0.84 micromol) attenuated stress responses in a dose-dependent fashion, as well as induced sleep, in Experiment 1.

In contrast, all the analogs and derivatives of L-serine had a sedative effect, although with a different manner in several behavioral markers of stress such as spontaneous activity and distress vocalizations. No significant changes in plasma corticosterone concentration were observed in any experiment. Taken together, the i.c.v. injection of L-serine analogs and its derivatives have sedative and hypnotic effects under an acute stressful condition, which does not involve the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In conclusion, L-serine may be effective in improving anxiety or sleep disorders induced by psychological stressor."},{"method":"The aim of the present study was to tax more directly the cooperation between the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in two different spatial tasks, a place navigation task and a spontaneous object exploration task, using a disconnection procedure.","background":"It has been recently shown that lesions of parahippocampal areas including the entorhinal cortex do not disrupt place learning in the water maze, suggesting that the hippocampo-cortical circuitry is not important for spatial memory [Burwell RD, Saddoris MP, Bucci DJ, Wiig KA.

Thus, the absence of the CR could not be accounted for by the general inability of the CS to alter the behaviour constituting the CR or the activity of the somatosensory cortex.

When the test occurred in a context that was familiar but different from the learning context, performance was unaffected in control rats, but rats with HPC lesions no longer discriminated between the objects, and therefore showed no evidence of recognizing the sample object. When the test context was unfamiliar, novel-object preference in control rats was attenuated but still above chance levels, whereas rats with HPC lesions did not show a preference. The data suggest that the HPC is not critical for encoding or retrieving conjunctive representations of the context in which incidental learning occurs, whereas it plays an essential role in recognition of objects that are subsequently encountered in different contexts."},{"method":"This study was carried out to establish a clinically relevant paradigm to assess somatic opiate withdrawal in mice.

Development of effective medications for opiate withdrawal symptoms is thus a primary research goal and heavily relies on improved experimental models.","conclusion":"Contrary to opioid receptor antagonist-precipitated procedures, the spontaneous opiate withdrawal paradigm used here revealed interesting gender- and morphine dose-linked differences. In particular, 56 h after last morphine administration elevated global opiate withdrawal scores were still evident in female but not in male mice treated with 20-100mg\/kg. The severity of somatic opiate withdrawal directly correlated with the prior cumulative morphine exposure. Timing of expression of somatic opiate withdrawal signs also varied as a function of both gender and morphine dose. For example, expression of paw tremors and wet dog shakes was earlier in opiate-withdrawn male than in female mice. Overall, these findings highlight the possibility to detect gender- and opiate dose-linked differences in the expression and duration of somatic opiate withdrawal using a clinically relevant research model. The behavioral paradigm described here may represent a more appropriate tool to investigate the neurobiological bases of opiate withdrawal as opposed to opioid receptor antagonist-precipitated opiate withdrawal procedures."},{"method":"Rats were randomly assigned to groups (ns=5-11) receiving dorsal striatal infusions of the ACh receptor antagonist scopolamine (0-18 microg\/microL at 0 and 2h or at 4 and 6h after training), the DA receptor antagonist cis-flupenthixol (0-25 microg\/microL at 0, 4 or 12h after training) or the inactive isomer trans-flupenthixol (6 microg\/microL at 0 h after training).","background":"Systemic treatments with acetylcholine (ACh) or dopamine (DA) receptor antagonists during hours 0-4 but not during hours 5-8 following training on a radial arm maze (RAM) or lesions of the dorsal striata impair learning.

Given after hours 0-4 following training, the effects of scopolamine were diminished but those of cis-flupenthixol were not. Trans-flupenthixol produced less impairment than cis-flupenthixol.

As task demands increased, strain differences emerged; C57BL\/6 mice were more accurate than DBA\/2 mice with stimuli of 2, 1 and 0.5s. DBA\/2 mice also made more anticipatory (impulsive) responses during inter-trial intervals than C57BL\/6 mice at SD of 5, 2, 1 and 0.5s. The ability to carry out the task was present in both strains of mice but they differed significantly in the levels of performance that were achieved. It is argued that the differences in accuracy and anticipatory responding were closely related and that the primary difference between the strains may be in impulsivity."},{"method":"The present study aimed to analyze the long-term effects of a brief handling (1 min) on morphine and ethanol dependence and on the preproenkephalin (PPE) mRNA and mu opioid receptor levels.","background":"Short early manipulations of rodent postnatal environment may trigger long-term effects on neurobiological and behavioural phenotypes in adulthood.

The goals were to determine if dietary induced gestational and lactational iron deficiency alters brain monoamine metabolism and behaviors dependent on that neurotransmitter system.","conclusion":"Despite anemia during lactation, most brain iron concentrations did not fall significantly until P25, and well after significant changes in monoamine levels, transporter levels, and D2R density changed in terminal fields. The changes in D2R density were far smaller than previously observed models that utilized severe dietary restriction during lactation or after weaning. Iron deficient pups had normal birth weight, but were delayed in the attainment of a number of milestones (bar holding, vibrissae-evoked forelimb placing). This approach of iron deficiency in utero and during lactation sufficient to cause moderate anemia but not stunt growth demonstrates that monaminergic metabolism changes occur prior to profound declines in brain iron concentration and is associated with developmental delays. Similar developmental delays in iron deficient human infants suggest to us that alterations in iron status during this developmental period likely affects developing brain monaminergic systems in these infants."},{"method":"Animals were exposed to a sensitizing regimen of methamphetamine, and were tested for OR one week, and locomotor behavior two weeks, later.

The raloxifene-treated animals also showed a significant improvement in the acquisition of working memory compared to vehicle-treated animals. However, raloxifene did not significantly improve the acquisition of reference memory or locomotor placing ability. Raloxifene treatment also did not result in a significant reduction in the size of the lesion cavity. Thus, the task-dependent improvements seen following raloxifene treatment do not appear to be the result of cortical neuroprotection.

GnRH mRNA levels in the brain correlated positively with GnRH-R1 mRNA levels in the pituitary but did not correlate with pituitary GnRH-R2. Measurements of GnRH-R1 and GnRH-R2 mRNA levels across the whole brain revealed no social status differences. These results show that, in addition to the known effects of social status on other levels of the HPG axis, GnRH receptor in the pituitary is also a target of social regulation."},{"method":"Wild type and tgHD (homozygotic and heterozygotic) rats were behaviorally tested at an age of 15 and 20 months.","background":"We tested the hypothesis that a recently developed transgenic rat model of Huntington's disease (tgHD rats) showed an age-and genotype-dependent change in psychomotor performance and in the frequency of choreiform movements similar to HD patients.","conclusion":"Our results show that tgHD rats exhibit an age-, and genotype-dependent deterioration of the psychomotor performance and choreiform symptoms, closely mimicking the clinical time course changes of psychomotor symptoms of HD patients.

Strategies-pretrained RS lesioned rats were specifically impaired in spatial place memory without a WM strategies impairment. Additional training overcame the spatial memory impairment. Thus the behavioral consequences of the lesion depend on the specific previous experience of the animal.

Distinct groups of PSD rats were administered with saline or different doses of ecstasy.

Under the influence of two intermediary doses (2.5 and 5mg\/kg), all animals displayed erection and ejaculation. The frequency of genital reflexes was also significantly greater than in relation to the PSD-saline group. The comparison between cocaine and ecstasy in PSD rats revealed that ecstasy induced more erections and ejaculations than cocaine. Thus, the present results showed a great enhancement of the genital reflexes of PSD rats that might have occurred due to serotoninergic alterations induced by this illicit substance when associated to sleep deprivation."},{"method":"The present study investigated the effects of elevated KYNA concentration on conditioned stimulus processing in rats. For the first 2 days of the experiment, a subset of rats received intracerebroventricular infusions of either KYNA (0.1 microM) or vehicle and were either returned to the home cage or received non-reinforced presentations of a visual stimulus. All rats subsequently received presentations of the same visual stimulus followed by food reward during a 6-day training phase.","background":"Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is a tryptophan metabolite synthesized and released by glia and recently shown to be a non-competitive antagonist of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at physiologically relevant concentrations, and NMDA receptors at higher concentrations. KYNA concentration is elevated in individuals with schizophrenia and those with Alzheimer's disease, two populations exhibiting cholinergic-related cognitive impairments.","conclusion":"In vehicle-treated rats, pre-exposure to the visual stimulus reduced orienting behaviour to the light (standing on the hind legs and orienting towards the visual stimulus) when it was later reinforced (i.e., conditioned orienting). In contrast, pre-exposure to the visual cue or 2 days of KYNA pretreatment reduced conditioned orienting behaviour. Finally, the reduction of orienting in KYNA-treated rats following pre-exposure was not as robust as in vehicle-treated rats. These results suggest that elevated KYNA levels can alter specific aspects of attentional processing of environmental stimuli and are discussed in terms of the potential contribution of KYNA to cognitive function and dysfunction."},{"method":"The results demonstrate that i.c.v. administration of r\/m HK-1 (5 nmol\/kg) could significantly potentiate the antinociceptive effects of morphine which was injected at peripheral and supraspinal level.","background":"Rat\/mouse hemokinin 1 (r\/m HK-1) is a mammalian tachykinin peptide whose biological functions are not fully understood. Our recent report showed that i.c.v. administration of r\/m HK-1 could produce dose- and time-related antinociceptive effect at nanomole concentration, and naloxone significantly antagonized this effect. Thus, we provide indirect evidence favoring a role of NK1 supraspinal receptors in the inhibitory control of descending pain pathways, a role that seems to partially involve the activation of the endogenous opioid systems. Based on this report, the present study was conducted to further investigate the direct functional interaction between supraspinal tachykinin (r\/m HK-1) and opioid systems.","conclusion":"These antinociceptive effects were blocked by prior treatment with the classical opioid receptors antagonist naloxone, indicating that the potentiated analgesic response is mediated by opioid-responsive neurons. Consistent with previous biochemical data, a likely mechanism underlying the peptide-mediated enhancement of opioid analgesia may center on the ability of r\/m HK-1 to release endogenous opioid peptides. We suggest that there may be a cascade amplification mechanism in pain modulation when the two agents were co-administrated. The synergistic analgesic relationship of morphine and r\/m HK-1 established here supports the hypothesis that supraspinal tachykinin and peripheral and central opioid systems have a direct functional interaction in the modulation of local nociceptive responses."},{"method":"Rats were trained to complete a task whereby they had a conflict between a positive reward and tolerance for thermal nociceptive stimulation.

These effects were blocked with morphine pre-treatment. The temporal profile for completing the task was also significantly altered following capsaicin treatment. These data demonstrate that using the operant orofacial assay in conjunction with capsaicin cream can provide a reproducible, sensitive, minimally invasive, and powerful approach for quantifying and studying enhanced thermal pain within the trigeminal system.

The pattern of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) expression seen was somewhat similar to that of GFAP. Behavioral data showed that even though all animals learned to perform the water maze task over time, the ischemia CON rats took longer to learn the task while all the ischemia EC animals performed as well as the sham groups. Regression analysis showed that increased GFAP was able to explain some of the variances in the behavioral parameters in the water maze of the ischemia EC rats suggesting that the activation of astrocytes in this group probably mediated enhanced functional recovery.

This immediate effect of dynorphin was evident in the context of suckling behavior but not in the context of adult-like drinking when water was delivered through an intra-oral cannula. One hour after injection, the unconditioned stimulatory effect of dynorphin had dissipated and no longer affected responsiveness to the nipple. However, pairing of centrally injected dynorphin and suckling on a nipple delivering water substantially enhanced responsiveness to a nipple 1h later. This suggested conditioning, and hence reinforcement, by the centrally injected dynorphin. The conditioned sustained nipple attachment was mediated through both kappa and micro opioid receptors.

Flight speed and jump escapes when the mouse was chased were significantly elevated by the 0.2 nmol dose. Both doses enhanced freezing and avoidance to a distant predator when the escape route was blocked.

Under the second condition, the rats were given the choice between operant and free access to water.","background":"We have previously reported that repeated administrations of quinpirole, a D2\/D3 dopamine receptor agonist, facilitate instrumental behavior in rats given the choice between operant and free access to water (contrafreeloading: CFL). The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of repeated daily administrations of quinpirole (0.5 mg\/kg i.p.) on the appetitive versus the consummatory component of water-reinforced behavior, under two experimental conditions.","conclusion":"Five major findings were obtained. First, acutely quinpirole suppressed operant behavior and, therefore, water intake for at least 1h. Second, upon repeated administrations tolerance developed to the suppressant effect of quinpirole on instrumental behavior but only to a lesser extent to the antidipsic effect, dissociating the appetitive from the consummatory components of water-reinforced behavior. Third, in CFL conditions quinpirole induced a progressively larger preference for the operant access. Fourth, even when the rats were given the choice between free access to highly palatable saccharine (0.05 or 0.01%) solutions and operant access to tap water, quinpirole shifted the animals towards the operant access. Fifth, repeated quinpirole produced lasting consequences on drinking behavior, since after rehydration and under drug-free conditions quinpirole-pretreated rats ingested larger amounts of water than control rats. In conclusion, the repeated activation of D2\/D3 receptors appears to induce the rats to perseverate in performing needless instrumental behavior."},{"method":"Thus, adult male rats of the Naples low- (NLE), high-excitability (NHE) and random-bred control (NRB) lines had 24-h access to a four-bottle system with tap water and 5, 10 and 20% alcohol solutions. Total voluntary alcohol intake and preference were measured during a 6-week period. In order to analyze behavioural dependence, two abstinence periods were introduced, followed by re-exposure to the bottles. The first was a pure re-test and the second was a quinine test (adding 0.02% quinine alcohol solution). Finally, to verify the role of opioids on alcohol drinking behaviour, rats received naltrexone (5 mg\/kg i.p.). Thirty minutes later, they had access for 2 h to a three-bottle system with water, 5 and 20% alcohol solution, respectively.","background":"Alcoholism is composed of a series of phenomena, which can be approached in model systems. Our aim was to investigate psychogenetics of alcohol drinking behaviour and dependence in the Naples rat lines.","conclusion":"Results indicate that (i) total alcohol intake on day 1 was higher in both NLE\/NHE, becoming higher in NLE rats during the 6-week period, (ii) different alcohol preference patterns in the Naples lines were observed over time of testing, (iii) during re-test, NLE rats showed neither reversibility nor alcohol deprivation effect, (iv) during quinine test, only NLE rats reduced alcohol intake to a lower extent and (v) naltrexone reduced by 50% the intake of the preferred solution. Therefore, the NLE rats appear as a new model for studying the neural substrates of the dependence behaviour."},{"method":"The present study investigates a novel memory task; the conditional delayed matching\/non-matching to position task (CDM\/NMTP) in the Skinner box. CDM\/NMTP uses the presence of specific stimulus cues to signify whether a particular trial is matching or non-matching in nature. Thus, it incorporates both the task contingencies within one session, and supplements the requirement for remembering the side of the lever in the sample phase with attending to the stimulus and remembering the conditional discrimination for the rule. Rats were trained preoperatively and the effects of bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the hippocampus were examined on postoperative retention of the task.","background":"The hippocampus is thought to be involved in a range of cognitive processes, from the ability to acquire new memories, to the ability to learn about spatial relationships. Humans and monkeys with damage to the hippocampus are typically impaired on delayed matching to sample tasks, of which the operant delayed matching to position task (DMTP) is a rat analogue. The reported effects of hippocampal damage on DMTP vary, ranging from delay-dependent deficits to no deficit whatsoever.","conclusion":"Rats with lesions of the hippocampus incurred a significant impairment on the task that was manifest at all delays intervals. Despite a bias towards matching during training, trials of either type were performed with equivalent accuracy and neither rule was affected differentially by the lesion. This task may prove useful in determining the cognitive roles of a range of brain areas."},{"method":"Quercetin-fed mice showed higher activity upon induction by new environmental stimuli, lower anxiety and higher novelty-seeking behavior in the open field tasks, and significantly improved learning and memory ability in step-through and Morris water Maze tests compared with D-gal-treated mice. We further investigated the mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective effects of quercetin on mouse brain. Quercetin significantly increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) level.","background":"We assessed the neuroprotective effects of quercetin-feeding at doses of 5 and 10 mg\/(kg day) on Kunming mice injected daily with D-gal (50 mg\/(kg day)) by behavioral tests.","conclusion":"These results imply that quercetin can reverse oxidant impairment induced by D-gal in mouse brain. Neurotoxicity is also associated with Ca(2+) overload induced by oxidant stress. Quercetin could maintain the Ca(2+) homeostasis in the brain of D-gal-treated mice. Furthermore, we also examined the expression of growth-associated protein GAP43 mRNA in mouse brain by in situ hybridization. We found that quercetin dramatically elevated the GAP43 mRNA expression in the brain of D-gal-treated mice to regenerate normal function of neurons against the cellular injury caused by D-gal."},{"method":"To assess qualitatively differently activated brain areas, categorical subsequent memory analyses were applied. In addition, we used linear parametric modulation to detect brain regions associated with \"memory-strength\".","background":"The main goal of the present fMRI-study was to identify the neural correlates underlying the successful encoding of words which can subsequently be freely recalled or recognized but not recalled. We were particularly interested in common as well as distinct neural substrates of both retrieval modes.","conclusion":"Our findings suggest that the successful verbal encoding of words, which were recognized but not recalled relies on a subset of the regions engaged during successful encoding of freely recalled words.

We addressed some factors that could affect these results. No major differences between mutants and controls were observed in the black\/white box test that investigates anxiety.

In a motor activity test, mutants displayed higher horizontal and vertical activities i.e. increased novelty-induced behavioral activation.","background":"CD26 exhibits a dipeptidylpeptidase-IV function (DPPIV) which regulates neuropeptide activity by N-terminal processing. Because abnormal plasma DPPIV was associated in mammals with behavioral changes, we examined the behavior of CD26-\/- mice resulting from targeted inactivation of the gene.","conclusion":"We conclude that DPPIV inactivation in mice broadly leads to an antidepressant-like and hyperactive phenotype."},{"method":"To investigate and compare the behavioural profile and EPS-asssociated side effects of haloperidol and risperidone APD treatment we applied a multi-tiered, comprehensive behavioural phenotyping approach. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated chronically (28 days) with supratherapeutic EPS-inducing doses of haloperidol and risperidone using osmotic minipumps. Domains such as motor activity, exploration, memory, and anxiety were analysed together with EPS assessment (\"early onset\" vacuous chewing movements and catalepsy).","background":"The therapeutic properties of typical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) such as haloperidol in schizophrenia treatment are mainly associated with their ability to block dopamine D2 receptors. This blockade is accompanied by side effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Atypical APDs such as risperidone have superior therapeutic efficacy possibly due to their activity at multiple receptors (in particular 5-HT2A receptors). Although the risk of EPS is significantly lower in atypical than in typical APDs, it is not negligible.","conclusion":"Both APDs produced diminished motor activity and exploration, impaired working memory performances, and increased anxiety levels. These effects were more pronounced in haloperidol-treated animals. Chronic APD treatment also caused a time-course dependent elevation of EPS-like symptoms. Risperidone-treated animals showed a catalepsy-like phenotype, which differed to that of haloperidol-treated rats, indicating that processes other than the anticipated dopaminergic mechanisms are underlying this phenomenon. These EPS-related phenotypes are consistent with reported EPS-inducing D2 receptor occupancies of around 80%. Differences in the behavioural profile of haloperidol and risperidone, which were revealed by a comprehensive phenotyping strategy, are likely due to the unique receptor activation profiles of these APDs."},{"method":"We suggest that this switching illustrates navigation first by directional and then by positional environmental cues, as hypothesized in the 'parallel map theory'.","background":"Exploration in a dark open field undergoes three progressive changes: (i) an initial phase of spending equal amounts of time in various zones of the arena changes to staying in the corners, and ultimately spending most of the time in one corner; (ii) travel paths are first circular and scattered all over the arena, but gradually become anchored to one corner at which they start and end; (iii) traveled distance gradually decreases to that of the initial level seen in a lit open field. Altogether, rodents shift from a 'looping' exploration mechanism with feeble coupling with the environment, to 'home base' exploration which is firmly anchored to the environment. This shift also involves switching from momentary and sporadic to repeated returns to a specific, presumably familiar place, to which the animal navigates back from various other places.","conclusion":"We also suggest that the transition from looping to home base behavior is part of a hierarchal construction of space representation via three modes of spatial information processing: (i) piloting--sequential processing, based on moving from one landmark to the next; (ii) orienting--parallel processing, based on moving from one point to the next, with the same starting and ending point; (iii) navigating--continuous processing, based on continuously updating the position in relation to several locations in the environment (map navigation)."},{"method":"In the present study, we analyzed behaviours relevant to affect, cognition, and motor control in Ddo(-\/-) mice.","background":"D-serine and D-aspartate are important regulators of mammalian physiology. D-aspartate is found in nervous and endocrine tissue, specifically in hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, pituitary, and adrenal medullary cells. Endogenous D-aspartate is selectively degraded by D-aspartate oxidase. We previously reported that adult male mice lacking the gene for D-aspartate oxidase (Ddo(-\/-) mice) display elevated concentrations of D-aspartate in several neuronal and neuroendocrine tissues as well as impaired sexual performance and altered autogrooming behaviour.","conclusion":"Ddo(-\/-) mice display deficits in sensorimotor gating and motor coordination as well as reduced immobility in the forced swim test. Basal corticosterone concentrations are elevated. The Ddo(-\/-) mice have D-aspartate immunoreactive cells in the cerebellum and adrenal glands that are not observed in the wild-type mice. However, no differences in anxiety-like behaviour are detected in open field or light-dark preference tests. Also, Ddo(-\/-) mice do not differ from wild-type mice in either passive avoidance or spontaneous alternation tasks. Although many of these behavioural deficits may be due to the lack of Ddo during development, our results are consistent with the widespread distribution of D-aspartate and the hypothesis that endogenous D-aspartate serves diverse behavioural functions."},{"method":"In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of chronic administration of quetiapine on methamphetamine (METH)-induced recognition memory impairment and dopaminergic terminal neurotoxicity in rats. Rats were pretreated with METH (5 mg\/kg; s.c.) four times at 2-h intervals while their body temperature was monitored. Fifteen minutes after the last METH injection, rats were administered quetiapine (10 mg\/kg\/day; i.p.) for 28 days. One day after the last quetiapine injection, rats were trained and tested on an object recognition task on days 29 and 30. Finally, on day 31, rats were sacrificed for immunohistochemistry, 1 day after the object recognition task.","background":"Previous studies have suggested that quetiapine, a new atypical antipsychotic drug, may have beneficial effects on cognitive impairment and be a neuroprotectant in treating neurodegenerative diseases.","conclusion":"METH induced hyperthermia, recognition memory impairment and a decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the caudate putamen (CPu) of striatum. Quetiapine attenuated the METH-induced hyperthermia. Furthermore, chronic post-treatment of quetiapine reversed the METH-induced memory impairment and dopaminergic terminal deficit.

Control subjects were born by vaginal delivery (VD). Subsequently, pups were given to surrogate mothers, weaned at 21 days, and mated at adulthood. After giving birth, differences in maternal competence and behavioural arousal were assessed observing: (i) maternal behaviour after reunion with the pups following a 3h separation, on postpartum day (PPD) 4; (ii) behaviour in an elevated plus-maze test, on postpartum day 7; and (iii) performance in a fear conditioning test, in which subjects learned to associate a conditional stimulus with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (postpartum days 7-8).","background":"This study analysed the long-term consequences of an asphyctic event at birth on maternal behaviour and emotionality in rats.","conclusion":"Results indicate that subjects in the CD+20 group showed a deficit in maternal care, taking a longer time to retrieve the whole litter and often failing to retrieve all pups. Both CD and CD+20 groups showed higher behavioural activity in the plus-maze. In addition, when tested in the fear conditioning paradigm, the CD+20 group showed a lower latency to perform freezing behaviour in the auditory cue trial. The changes in behavioural arousal described suggest that the dopaminergic system may be a potential neurochemical target for an early hypoxic insult and indicate maternal behaviour as a useful endpoint to study the effects of early birth insult on brain function."},{"method":"Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats were tested for unconditioned and conditioned responses to both odours.","background":"Cat odour and trimethylthiazoline (TMT) are two predator odours commonly used to study defensive behaviour in rats. However their reported efficacy varies markedly across laboratories. We assessed whether rat strain differences might explain such variation.","conclusion":"Cat odour produced robust unconditioned and conditioned defensive behaviour, with notably stronger effects in Wistar rats. TMT produced limited unconditioned avoidance, but failed to elicit conditioned responses in either strain. Results support suggestions that faeces-derived odours such as TMT are less predictive of a predator threat than those derived from fur or skin, and identify the possibility that strain differences affect the defensive response seen to predator odours."},{"method":"The animals underwent a subchronic nicotine treatment (0.4 mg\/kg i.p., once daily) during the periadolescent period (postnatal days 34-43). Twenty-four hours after the last injection of nicotine an acute dose of CP (1 or 100 microg\/kg i.p.) was administered. Thirty minutes after the cannabinoid injection, the animals were tested individually in the holeboard immediately followed by the elevated plus-maze. We also measured corticosterone levels by radioimmunoassay.","background":"We have studied functional interactions between nicotine and the cannabinoid receptor agonist CP 55,940 (CP) in the modulation of behavioural and corticosterone responses of male and female adolescent Wistar rats.","conclusion":"In males, neither CP (1 microg\/kg) nor nicotine induced any modification in anxiety when administered alone. However, the combination of the two drugs resulted in a significant anxiogenic-like effect. In females, the lower dose of CP was anxiogenic and nicotine, which did not induce any effect per se, prevented this response. In the holeboard, subchronic nicotine and the acute cannabinoid treatment interacted in the modulation of horizontal activity and the nature of this interaction also showed a clear sexual dimorphism. Both, the cannabinoid agonist and nicotine increased corticosterone concentrations and the animals receiving the two drugs showed higher levels than the animals receiving the cannabinoid alone. The data provide evidence for the existence of functional interactions between nicotine and cannabinoids in the modulation of behavioural responses and adrenocortical activity in adolescent rats."},{"method":"In this study, the effect of chronic (60 days) oral administration of L-type calcium channel blocker verapamil on learning and memory and synaptic plasticity of hippocampal dentate gyrus in rats has been investigated. L-type calcium channel antagonist, verapamil chronically and orally at different doses (10, 20 and 50 mg\/kg) was used to investigate learning and memory by passive avoidance learning. LTP in perforant-DG synapses was assessed (by either 200 or 400 Hz tetanization) in order to investigate long-term effect of verapamil on synaptic plasticity. In this case, field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slope and population spike (PS) amplitude were measured.","background":"It has been shown that L-type voltage dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) have important role in learning and memory. In vivo and in vitro electrophysiological recordings of hippocampal neurons have demonstrated their involvement in long-term potentiation (LTP), which considers being one possible cellular mechanism underlying learning and memory. The long-term effect of VDCCs of hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) so far on synaptic plasticity has not received much attention.","conclusion":"Our behavioral study has shown that chronic oral treatment of verapamil has no effect on learning whereas verapamil (50 mg\/kg) decreased memory retrieval. Verapamil (20 and 50 mg\/kg) inhibited EPSP-LTP induction at 400 Hz but not at 200 Hz tetanization. Furthermore, only verapamil (50mg\/kg) decreased PS-LTP with respect to control group. These data suggest that 400 Hz LTP is required for activation of L-type VDCCs and it seems that verapamil is more effective on L-type calcium channels of DG dendrites than their soma."},{"method":"An open-field maze that was similar to the dry version of the Morris water maze was used.

In order to identify the brain areas in teleost fish that are homologous to mammalian hippocampus, the present study examined the effects of lesions in the dorsal area of the caudal telencephalon of goldfish (Carassius auratus) on the acquisition of spatial learning.","conclusion":"Only in experiment 2, there was a significant deficit in the performance in the training sessions in the goldfish with damage to the dorsomedial area of the caudal telencephalon (DM). These data showed that blocking of the extramaze cues in the habituation sessions caused deficits in postoperative acquisition of spatial learning in the training sessions in the goldfish with DM lesions. Latent learning in the habituation sessions, however, eliminated the effects of the DM lesions on spatial learning. The present study suggests that the DM plays a critical role in acquisition of spatial learning."},{"method":"Under anesthesia, adult Swiss male mice were submitted to unilateral (right or left) hemispherectomy or sham surgery. Fifteen days after surgery, the immobile and turning behaviors of each mouse were measured during a 5-min forced swimming testing session.","background":"In order to test the hypothesis that behavioral coping with stressful situations is asymmetrically modulated by the hemispheres, we used the unilateral hemispherectomy procedure to assess the relative importance of each hemisphere in the determination of the immobility time during the forced swimming test.","conclusion":"In general, while turning activity decreased significantly as the test progressed, an increase in immobility was observed. The unilateral hemispherectomy asymmetrically affected the immobility time in the forced swimming test. Particularly, the increase in immobility time of right-hemispherectomized mice was greater than that observed for sham-operated ones. In contrast, there were no differences in turning activity between the groups. The higher immobility time in males that had their right hemisphere removed supports the hypothesis that the two hemispheres contribute differentially to the behavioral response to stress."},{"method":"In this study changes in hippocampal synaptic efficacy were measured in awake, freely behaving rats during exploration of novel environments. Because hippocampal physiology is modulated by on-going behavior, evoked potentials collected during Type 1 versus Type 2 behavior were evaluated separately.

The cellular and molecular mechanisms of one form of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation (LTP), are thought to overlap significantly with the neural mechanisms of learning.","conclusion":"The results show that exploration causes an increase in population spike amplitude with no change in excitatory postsynaptic potential during Type 1 behavior that lasts longer than 5 min. Prior induction of hippocampal LTP occludes the change induced by exploration.

To determine whether E could be working through uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2), a protein involved with inflammation and regulated by estrogen in some tissues, autonomic dysreflexia was assessed in E-treated adult male mice lacking UCP-2 (UCP-2 KO).","background":"Autonomic dysreflexia is an autonomic behavioural condition that manifests after spinal cord injury (SCI) and is characterized by acute, episodic hypertension following afferent stimulation below the level of the injury. Common triggers of autonomic dysreflexia include colorectal distension (CRD), and various somatic stimuli. The development of autonomic dysreflexia is dependent, in part, upon the degree of intraspinal inflammation and the resultant spinal neuroplastic changes that occur following SCI. 17beta-estradiol (E) has neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and smooth muscle relaxant properties, and is therefore a candidate drug for the treatment and\/or prevention of autonomic dysreflexia.","conclusion":"17beta-estradiol was equipotent at reducing autonomic dysreflexia in both UCP-2 KO and WT mice following CRD but not tail pinch.

In placing tests, behavioral deficits elicited by each single treatment were worsened by combined treatment with chemoagent microinjection and focal cortical compression. Concurrently, local delivery of chemoagent into the compressed cortex induced increased cortical tissue loss, necrosis and apoptosis.

This indicates that choice of arm use is spatially rather opportunistic when depending on visual guidance. Additionally, first contact with an object was usually established by the central third of the arm and in arm contact sequences neighboring arms were the most likely to follow an arm already touching the object.

Ten female rats were evaluated at the same speed for natural overground and treadmill walking.","background":"The convenience of the motor-driven treadmill makes it an attractive instrument for investigating rat locomotion. However, no data are available to indicate whether hindlimb treadmill kinematic findings may be compared or generalized to overground locomotion.","conclusion":"The walking velocity, swing duration and stride length were statistically indistinguishable between the two testing conditions. Significant differences were found between overground and treadmill locomotion for step cycle duration and stance phase duration parameters. During the stance phase of walking, the angular movement of the hip, knee and ankle joints were significantly different in the two conditions, with greater flexion occurring on the overground. Despite this, the sagittal joint movements of the hindlimb were similar between the two walking conditions, with only three parameters being significantly different in the swing. Hip height and angle-angle cyclograms were also only found to display subtle differences.

Interestingly, the amount of REM sleep in the ferret was considerably higher (24.01+\/-1.61% of total recording time) than typically reported in placental mammals. Ferret sleep was homeostatically regulated as sleep deprivation produced a significant increase in NREM EEG delta power during the recovery period.

However, there are an increasing number of studies not showing this. It has been proposed that the effect of long maternal separation (LMS) is partly due to the disruption of maternal care caused by the separations. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether increasing the number of daily separations would produce more robust effects in the adult offspring on anxiety-like behaviour in the defensive withdrawal test, and on spontaneous motor activity. Since previous studies of LMS have revealed sex differences in behaviour, we included both males and females.","conclusion":"As adults we found no effects of this LMS paradigm in male rats, although BMS males showed a tendency toward decreased anxiety-like behaviour. In contrast, LMS females showed a decrease in anxiety-like behaviour. We also found significant sex differences that were most prominent in the LMS group, indicating that females are more sensitive to our maternal separation paradigm. The present study suggests that increasing the number of maternal separations does not increase anxiety-like behaviour in neither male nor female Wistar rats."},{"method":"Therefore, the aim of this work was to compare the behavioral and cardiovascular effects of CBD and diazepam, a prototype anxiolytic, in animals submitted to a contextual conditioned fear paradigm. Male Wistar rats were submitted to a 10min conditioning session (six footshocks, 2.5 mA, 3s, delivered at pseudo-random intervals). The behavioral and cardiovascular responses to the context were measured 24h later in a 10 min test session. Diazepam (2.5 mg\/kg), FG-7142 (8 mg\/kg), a benzodiazepine inverse agonist, or CBD (10 mg\/kg) were administered i.p. before the test session.","background":"Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotomimetic compound from Cannabis sativa that induces anxiolytic-like effects similar to diazepam in animal models of innate aversive behavior. However, the effects of CBD contextual conditioned fear have not been studied.","conclusion":"Conditioned rats submitted to the aversive context exhibited more freezing behavior and a larger increase in blood pressure and heart rate as compared to non-conditioned animals. These effects were attenuated by CBD and diazepam in the conditioned animals. These drugs did not have any effect in non-conditioned rats. FG-7142 treatment failed to change the behavioral and cardiovascular responses to the aversive context. In conclusion, the results suggest that CBD has anxiolytic-like properties similar to those of diazepam in a rat model of conditioned fear to context."},{"method":"Here we show that, at adulthood, compared to mice reared in standard laboratory conditions (SN), CN reared mice displayed increased anxiety-like behavior, performing more thigmotaxis in the open field and spending less time in the open arms of the plus-maze. Furthermore, we showed that social context (being alone or with a familiar conspecific in the test apparatus) affects the emotional response in both the plus-maze and open field test and that the relevance of social context changes according to the early social experiences.","background":"Early experiences affect brain function and behavior at adulthood. Being reared in a communal nest (CN), consisting in a single nest where three mothers keep their pups together and share care-giving behavior from birth to weaning (postnatal day 25), provides a highly stimulating social environment to the developing pup. CN characterizes the natural ecological niche of many rodent species including the mouse.","conclusion":"In particular, CN mice display higher levels of anxiety-like behavior, compared to SN mice, only when alone but not in the presence of a familiar conspecific. Overall, in line with previous findings, the present study suggests that CN mice have a more elaborate social and emotional behavior compared to SN mice and thus may be more appropriate to investigate socio-emotional impairments, in particular in the case of mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, or anxiety and mood disorders."},{"method":"The aim of our study was to conduct an NIRS cognitive activation study to verify PFC dysfunction in PDD. The subjects were 10 adults with PDD and 10 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects. Hemoglobin concentration changes were measured with a 24-channel NIRS machine during the letter fluency task.","background":"Functional neuroimaging studies have suggested that dysfunction of prefrontal cortex (PFC) is present in persons with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). Recently, the development of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has enabled noninvasive bedside measurement of regional cerebral blood volume. Although NIRS enables the noninvasive clarification of brain functions in many psychiatric disorders, it has not yet been used to examine subjects with PDD.","conclusion":"While the number of words generated during the letter fluency task did not differ significantly between groups, the analysis of covariance including IQ as a confounding covariate showed that the PDD group was associated with bilateral reduction in oxy-hemoglobin concentration change as compared with the control group. The statistical results did not change when only IQ-matched high-functioning subjects (N=7) were included. Moreover, reduced oxy-hemoglobin concentration change for the right PFC was significantly correlated with verbal communication deficits within the PDD group. The present findings are consistent with proposed prefrontal dysfunction in PDD subjects identified by other neuroimaging modalities. The present results may be also potentially useful for applying NIRS to clinical settings of child psychiatry."},{"method":"In this study, we further addressed this question by investigating the effects of the reversible inactivation of the nucleus on escape behavior generated in male Wistar rats by two different aversive stimuli, electrical stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (dPAG) and exposure to one of the open arms of the elevated T-maze.","background":"In the last years, the role played by the medial nucleus of the amygdala (MeA) in the modulation of fear- and anxiety-related behaviors has been increasingly investigated. This nucleus plays an important role in the processing of predator odor-induced defensive reactions, i.e. freezing and risk-assessment behaviors. Immunohistochemical evidence also indicates that the MeA may be involved in the regulation of escape, a defensive behavior related to panic attacks.","conclusion":"Results showed that intra-MeA administration of either the reversible sodium channel blocker lidocaine (34 nmol\/0.2 microl) or the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol (0.22 nmol\/0.2 microl) raised the threshold of aversive electrical stimulation, increasing the amount of current that applied to the dPAG evokes escape, an antiaversive effect. Local microinjection of muscimol (0.22 nmol\/0.2 microl) inhibited escape behavior in the elevated T-maze, also suggesting an antiaversive effect. In this latter test, muscimol did not affect inhibitory avoidance, a behavior associated with generalized anxiety disorder. Muscimol effect in the elevated T-maze was independent of changes in general exploratory activity as measured in an open-field. Taken together, our data corroborate previous evidences suggesting that the MeA is involved in the modulation of escape. Dysfunction of this regulatory mechanism may be of relevance in the genesis\/maintenance of panic disorder."},{"method":"We confirm here that the inhibition of SRC-1 expression by daily intracerebroventricular injections of locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides in the third ventricle at the level of the preoptic area-hypothalamus (HPOA) significantly reduces testosterone-dependent male sexual behavior. In the first experiment, aromatase protein expression in HPOA was inhibited in SRC-1-depleted males but the enzymatic activity remained at the level measured in controls. We observed in the second experiment a recovery of the behavioral response to testosterone treatment after interruption of the antisense injection.","background":"Steroid receptors such as the androgen and estrogen receptors require the presence of several proteins, known as coactivators, to enhance the transcription of target genes. The first goal of the present study was to define the role of SRC-1 on the steroid-dependent expression of the aromatase protein and its activity in male Japanese quail. The second goal was to analyze the rapid plasticity of the POM following antisense treatment interruption.","conclusion":"However, several morphological characteristics of the POM were not different between the control group, the antisense-treated birds and antisense-treated birds in which treatment had been discontinued 3 days earlier. Antisense was also less effective in knocking-down SRC-1 in the present experiments as compared to our previous study. An analysis of this variation in the degree of knock-down of SRC-1 expression suggests dissociation among different aspects of steroid action on brain and behavior presumably resulting from the differential sensitivity of behavioral and neurochemical responses to the activation by testosterone and\/or its estrogenic metabolites."},{"method":"We now report that with as few as 1 or 3 exposures to cocaine (total of 45 mg\/kg, i.p., per day), and a drug-free period of 28 days, i.c.v. injections of CRF (0.5 microg) produce augmented locomotor responses, similar to those induced by cocaine (10 mg\/kg, i.p.) itself.

Spontaneous jumps in the shuttle box (inter-trial crossings) were frequently seen in wild F-0 and F-1, but rarely in LAB. All groups exhibited nearly the same ability to remember after 2 weeks without training. In the open field test applied on 5 consecutive days, no differences in locomotion patterns and inner field preferences were found. Rearing frequency decreased over 5 days in wild gerbils. Running distances (4-6m\/min) were similar in wild F-0 and LAB, but higher in wild F-1. The ratio of brain size to body weight did not differ between wild F-0 and F-1, but was 17.1% lower in LAB. Correspondingly high brain weights in wild F-1 and F-0 support our domestication hypothesis and negate any serious effect of early experience or captivity on brain size in Mongolian gerbils. In contrast, wild F-1 raised in the laboratory show a rapid improvement in learning performance, indicating that early experience rather that genetic differences between strains affect shuttle box discrimination learning in gerbils."},{"method":"Here, we show that environmental exposure to DDT alters the brains of American Robins (Turdus migratorius) in several ways. Increasing levels of DDT resulted in: (i) smaller brain and relative forebrain volumes; (ii) a reduction in the size of two song nuclei, nucleus robustus arcopallialis (RA) and HVC; and (iii) a drastic reduction in neuronal size and overall volume of nucleus intercollicularis (ICo), a structure that is critical for normal sexual behaviour. These changes likely result from stress, direct neurotoxicity and androgen receptor antagonism by the primary metabolite of DDT, p,p'-DDE and this is corroborated by analyses of brain region volumes and p,p'-DDE levels.","background":"Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is a persistent organochlorine compound found worldwide that causes significant anatomical, physiological and behavioural abnormalities in humans and wildlife. However, little is known about whether environmental exposure to DDT affects the brain.","conclusion":"Our results therefore demonstrate that environmental exposure to DDT is correlated with significant changes in the brain and specifically those structures related to mating and song. Given the magnitude of these changes in the brain and the fact that environmental DDT exposure was restricted to early development, we conclude that both humans and wildlife that live in DDT contaminated environments may be at risk of neurological damage."},{"method":"Here we examine how repeated intermittent social defeat affects cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus (DG) in mice.

In a third experiment, aggressive resident mice were allowed to fight with an intruder mouse every day for 10 days, and these residents were injected with BrdU 1h after the last aggressive encounter.","background":"Stressful experiences can affect hippocampal structure and function and can suppress new cell birth in the adult hippocampus in several species.","conclusion":"There was a significant decrease in cell proliferation in mice that received 10 social defeats, confirming and extending earlier results. This decrease is correlated with the intensity of the defeat experiences, as quantified by frequency of attack bites. Cell proliferation was slightly inhibited after a single defeat, although this effect was not significant. Three defeats within a 5-h period had no effect on levels of proliferation. Offensive aggressive stress in the residents did not result in any changes in hippocampal cell proliferation. These data indicate that repeated intermittent social defeat experienced over multiple days suppresses proliferation in the DG, and this may have important implications for our understanding of hippocampal changes related to stress psychopathologies."},{"method":"Therefore, we examined the effect of pre-training, post-training and pre-probe trial intrahippocampal CA1 administration of a selective OX1R the orexin 1 receptor antagonist SB-334867-A (1.5, 3, 6 microg\/0.5 microl) on acquisition, consolidation and retrieval in a single-day testing version of Morris water maze (MWM) task.","background":"Orexin containing neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) produce orexin-A (hypocretin-1) and orexin-B (hypocretin-2) and send their axons to the hippocampus, which predominantly expresses orexin 1 receptors (OX1Rs) showing a higher affinity to orexin-A. Recent studies have shown that central administration of orexin-A has an effect on learning and memory but literature concerning the role of orexinergic system in cognition remains controversial.","conclusion":"Our results show that, SB-334867-A impaired acquisition, consolidation and retrieval of MWM task as compared with the control group. This drug had no effect on escape latency of a non-spatial visual discrimination task. Therefore, it seems that endogenous orexins, especially orexin-A, play an important role in spatial learning and memory in the rat."},{"method":"We examined effects of rolipram, nefiracetam, and dopamine D2-like receptor antagonists, all of which have been reported to modulate cAMP level in vivo, on the discriminative-stimulus effects of methamphetamine (METH) and morphine in rats.","background":"Animal models of drug discrimination have been used to examine the subjective effects of addictive substances. The cAMP system is a crucial downstream signaling pathway implicated in the long-lasting neuroadaptations induced by addictive drugs.","conclusion":"All these compounds inhibited the discriminative-stimulus effects of METH, while only rolipram and nefiracetam attenuated the discriminative-stimulus effects of morphine. In addition, neither nifedipine nor neomycin, two voltage-sensitive calcium channel blockers, was found to modulate the effect of nefiracetam on METH-associated discriminative stimuli, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of nefiracetam may not involve the activation of calcium channels.

One hypothesis that accounts for such links is that spatial attention operates upon representations of common locations in the external space. However, convincing evidence only exists for cross-modal links in spatial orienting, leaving the dynamics of these effects unexplored.","conclusion":"Results revealed modality-specific meridian effects in the short sequences, and a significant decrement of the modality-specific meridian effect in the long sequences. The results of these experiments indicate that cross-modal links in visual and auditory spatial attention are based on representations of common locations in the external space across sensory modalities. Moreover, the results strongly support the hypothesis that representations of space are dynamically built and updated according to task demands."},{"method":"Anatomical analyses fail to demonstrate direct interactions of the subiculum with principal stress-effector neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus, consistent with a trans-synaptic mechanism of action. Accordingly, tracing data indicate that glutamatergic ventral subiculum neurons innervate GABAergic neurons in several paraventricular nucleus-projecting neurons in the hypothalamus and basal forebrain, suggesting that inhibition is mediated by glutamate-GABA relays. The subiculum also innervates several limbic forebrain structures that in turn have bisynaptic projections to paraventricular neurons, such as the prefrontal cortex, amygdala and lateral septum, suggesting that the subiculum may have a generalized up-stream influence on limbic stress integration.","background":"The mammalian subiculum plays a prominent role in inhibition of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. Lesion and stimulation studies indicate that the hippocampus, acting via output neurons of the ventral subiculum, acts to attenuate stress-induced glucocorticoid release. Lesions of the ventral subiculum enhance glucocorticoid secretion following psychogenic, but not systemic stressors, indicating that the influence of this structure on the HPA system is stressor-specific.","conclusion":"Finally, recent information suggests that the subiculum may also be stress excitatory under some circumstances, and that there may be substantial strain or individual differences in the net contribution of the subiculum, to stress integration. Overall, the present state of knowledge indicates that the role of the subiculum in stress integration is complex, and likely involves interactions of stress-relevant subicular output with limbic-hypothalamic stress-integrative circuits."},{"method":"We report that acute cocaine alters vSUB pyramidal neuron activity by inducing a frequency-dependent output mode transition from bursting to single-spiking.","background":"The ventral subiculum (vSUB) is an interface between the hippocampal formation and structures in the brain reward circuitry, such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). The vSUB powerfully activates the dopamine system, particularly in response to novelty. This activity is both necessary and sufficient to elevate nucleus accumbens dopamine levels triggered by a novel stimulus. Direct stimulation of the vSUB increases the population of active dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area and dopamine levels in the accumbens via a multisynaptic route relayed through the nucleus accumbens. Furthermore, activity in the vSUB is correlated with drug-seeking behaviour such that vSUB inhibition attenuates cocaine-primed reinstatement of drug-seeking, while brief vSUB activation triggers reinstatement cocaine-seeking.","conclusion":"We suggest that under normal conditions bursting and output mode switching (bursting to single-spiking) may be needed for proper routing of information in and out of the vSUB.

For comparison, the effect of cocaine on locomotor activity was studied in mice withdrawn from nicotine.","background":"Evidence for an interaction between nicotine and morphine has been found in several studies.","conclusion":"Morphine (15 mg\/kg s.c.) enhanced locomotor activity significantly more in the nicotine-withdrawn mice than in the controls, whereas cocaine (20 mg\/kg i.p.) stimulated the locomotor activity similarly in the nicotine-withdrawn and in the control mice. Morphine (10 mg\/kg s.c.) elevated dopamine and 5-HT metabolites to the same degree in the NAc of the nicotine-withdrawn and the control mice. However, in the CPu morphine enhanced the metabolism of dopamine and also that of 5-HT in the nicotine-withdrawn mice but not in the controls. In addition, the basal concentrations of dopamine metabolites were reduced in the CPu of the nicotine-withdrawn mice.

This intense interest relates to both the perplexing pathogenesis and devastating consequences of these disorders. One of the obstacles to understanding the pathogenesis of autism and to developing efficient treatment has been the paucity of animal models that could be used for hypotheses-driven mechanistic studies of abnormal brain and behavior development and for the pre-clinical testing novel pharmacological treatments.","conclusion":"We found that neonatal BDV infection profoundly affected social behaviors in adult rats. Compared to the control rats, both 90- and 180-day-old infected rats spent less time in active social interaction and more time in following their partners. In the intruder-resident test, the BDV-infected resident rats exhibited less aggression towards the intruders and showed more the following-the-intruder behavior. The following-the-partner behavior may be an example of \"stereotypic\" activity due to BDV-induced abnormal social communication between rats. The previously published results and present findings indicate that neonatal BDV infection significantly altered the normal pattern of social interaction in rats.

Several of the behavioural variables derived from the test battery correlated differently with the size of the hippocampal and cerebellar lesions. In contrast, no absolute dissociation between the effects of these lesions was found in the Morris maze, a reportedly hippocampus-dependent learning and memory task. The contextual fear conditioning task, on the other hand, did reveal a selective decrease of context-dependent freezing in hippocampus-lesioned mice, whereas cerebellum-lesioned animals displayed an increase in freezing responses.

Both genetically modified mice learned the paradigm and the timing of the task, like their respective WTs, and no olfactory dysfunctioning was observed.

Target signal strength was manipulated by lowering the relative amount of signal dots constituting the target, i.e., the coherence level (100%-50%-30%-10%; the distractor surface was always 100% coherent).

This corresponds with continuous attempts, successful and unsuccessful, to correct inaccurate synchronisation. In the absence of a colour cue, difficulties were frequently observed in all coherence conditions, but they differed depending on the coherence level.

Following training, excitotoxic lesions of the NAC were made by intracranial injections of 0.5 microl 0.15 M quinolinic acid (n=12) or vehicle (n=12) aimed at the NAC (AP +1.6, ML +\/-1.5, DV -7.1).","background":"Both humans and non-humans discount the value of rewards that are delayed or uncertain, and individuals that discount delayed rewards at a relatively high rate are considered impulsive. To investigate the neural mechanisms that mediate delay discounting, the present study examined the effects of excitotoxic lesions of the nucleus accumbens (NAC) on discounting of reward value by delay and probability.","conclusion":"NAC lesions did not alter performance in animals tested with a constant delay (4s) or probability (0.4) of reinforcement. However, when tested with between session changes in the delay (0, 1, 2, 4, and 8s) of reinforcement, the lesioned rats had flatter discount curves than the sham group, indicating that they were less sensitive to frequent changes in the delay to reward. In contrast, the NAC lesions did not affect discounting of probabilistic rewards. NAC lesions impaired the ability to adapt to frequent between session changes in the delay to reward but did not increase or decrease discounting when the delay was held constant across sessions. NAC lesions may disrupt the ability of the animals to predict the timing of delayed rewards when the delay to reward is changed frequently."},{"method":"This paper will review evidence that mice of the BALB\/c inbred strain show relatively low levels of social interaction in various settings and across various stages of development, including male-male interactions, female-female interactions, male-female sexual interactions, and parenting behaviors.","background":"Low sociability is one of the most prominent and disabling symptoms of autism. The biology of sociability is not well understood, and there is no available treatment that adequately improves social functioning in most autistic patients. The development of animal models of reduced sociability can aid in the elucidation of the biology of social behaviors, and may ultimately shed light on the biology of autism.","conclusion":"Taken together, this evidence suggests a generally low level of sociability in BALB\/c mice that may be relevant to autism. BALB\/c mice also show other phenotypes with possible relevance to autism, including relatively high levels of anxiety and aggressive behaviors, large brain size, underdevelopment of the corpus callosum, and low levels of brain serotonin. Further research is needed to determine the relationship among these BALB\/c phenotypes, and to determine their possible relevance to autism. In conclusion, the BALB\/c inbred strain may be a useful animal model for identifying genes and neurobiological pathways involved in autism-related phenotypes."},{"method":"We compared the performance of rats with bilateral excitotoxic damage to RC with that of control rats in a battery of conventional tests, including an open field, plus maze, fear conditioning, step-through passive avoidance, and two-way active avoidance techniques.","background":"There is strong evidence that the rat retrosplenial cortex (RC) is implicated in spatial navigation and in learning of both aversive and reward-based discrimination tasks. However, its involvement in other functions subserved by the limbic system to which it belongs has not yet been documented.","conclusion":"In the open field, RC-lesioned rats showed somewhat decreased locomotion in the inner zone and increased defecation, which is suggestive of an anxiogenic effect. However, no differences between groups were detected in the plus-maze and inhibitory avoidance tests. Freezing scores recorded during fear conditioning, as well as during the context and tone tests, which were performed, respectively, 24 and 48 h after conditioning, did not differ between the groups. In contrast, acquisition of the active avoidance response was significantly impaired in rats with damaged RC, regarding both response latency and correctness. These data suggest that although the rat RC may play a role in the regulation of emotional responsiveness to new situations, it does not appear to contribute to emotional memory. They are also consistent with the idea that RC is a part of the limbic system that is involved in the compilation of motor programs for complex stereotyped movements such as approach and avoidance."},{"method":"After 15 days of abstinence, the locomotor activating properties of morphine as well as its motivational properties were not facilitated by pretreatment with THC in mice and even reduced for the higher dose of morphine used in the conditioned place preference (CPP). This lack of CPP in animals pretreated with THC was not due to discrimination impairment between different environments, as demonstrated in a two-trial recognition task.","background":"Several studies have investigated interactions between opioid and cannabinoid systems. However, the results regarding the rewarding effects of opiates in animals pre-exposed to CB1 agonists, appear inconsistent. Using the conditioned place preference, it was shown that dependence to delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) was hardly reached, while the synthetic ligand WIN55,212-2 facilitate the rewarding effects of morphine. The aim of the present study was to establish whether a chronic THC treatment (10 mg\/kg, i.p., 21 days) may facilitate, in mice, the rewarding effects of morphine used at low doses (0.5 and 2 mg\/kg, i.p.) or high dose (10 mg\/kg, i.p.) after a long drug-free period, as it was speculated that chronic cannabinoid exposure may induce long-lasting neural changes in brain regions involved in opiate addiction. Moreover, THC was used in conditions as close as possible to those leading to cannabis drawbacks.","conclusion":"In conclusion, it appears that chronic THC treatment leads to a reduction of reinforcing effects of morphine in the CPP. This result supports the occurrence of modulatory interaction between opioid and cannabinoid systems in the reward process."},{"method":"This study was interested in manual laterality in 12 Campbell's monkeys (Cercopithecus c. campbelli). Several theories were examined, using both direct behavioural observations during feeding behaviour and six controlled experimental conditions, in which we varied task demands to investigate the effect of two factors. We systematically varied the individual posture (sat, tripedal, bipedal, clung) and the complexity of the task (box with or without a lid to open).","background":"Behavioural asymmetries, once thought to be exclusively human, appear to be widespread in vertebrates. A population-level bias should stem from natural selection and reflect a cerebral dominance, while individual preferences might be linked to individual characteristics. Manual laterality has been extensively investigated in non-human primates. However, despite a strong data base, no general patterns have emerged, resulting in a few explanatory theories and little consensus.","conclusion":"Concerning the direction of preference, we found individual and action-specific preferences for experimental actions, which match previous reports. No population bias emerged and each subject appeared to react differently to the factors, hereby contradicting the theories. However, concerning the strength of preference, all individuals tended to be affected in similar ways. Spontaneous actions were less lateralized than experimental ones, and the simplest task and spontaneous category tended to show the weakest laterality. The relative complexity and novelty of these actions may account for these results."},{"method":"Facial recognition was also assessed.","background":"Human tests designed to mirror rodent tests of object recognition and spatial navigation were administered to adult cognitively healthy humans.","conclusion":"There was no sex difference in facial recognition, consistent with earlier studies. In the object recognition test, the test-retest NINL total scores during the same visit were highly correlated, comparable to the test-retest correlations obtained in the established facial recognition test. There were no effects of sex on object recognition. However, in the spatial navigation test, there were effects of sex on spatial learning and memory during the session with the hidden, but not visible, target. These tests might be useful to compare assessments of object recognition and spatial learning and memory in humans and animal models."},{"method":"Pre-training administration of morphine (5mg\/kg) decreased the learning of a one-trial passive avoidance task, which was reversed by pre-test administration of the same dose of morphine. Amnesia induced by pre-training morphine was also significantly reversed in nicotine (0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 mg\/kg)-treated animals on the test day. Morphine induced amnesia was also reversed in animals which had previously received sub-chronic injections of nicotine, once daily for 3 days followed by 14 days of no drug treatment. The restoration of memory by pre-test morphine was also reduced in animals which had previously received once daily injections of atropine (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg\/kg, i.p.) for 3 days after 14 of being days drug free. In the animals, restoration of memory by sub-chronic nicotine administration, was also decreased by once daily administration of atropine (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg\/kg) 10 min prior to injection of nicotine (0.1 microg\/kg\/day, for 3 days) but not with SCH 23390; R(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine HCl (0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 mg\/kg) or sulpiride (25, 50 and 100 mg\/kg) during 3-days of treatment with nicotine.","background":"In the present study, the effects of acute and sub-chronic pretreatment of nicotine on impairment of memory formation and the state-dependent learning by morphine have been investigated in mice.","conclusion":"The results suggest that nicotine may induce sensitization which affects the impairment of memory formation via cholinergic but not dopaminergic systems."},{"method":"Rats were given 15 afterdischarges (ADs) evoked in CA1 over 3 days or control stimulations.","background":"To test the hypothesis that GABA(B) receptor efficacy in the behaving rat decreases after partial hippocampal kindling, we measured GABA(B) receptor efficacy by the number of wet dog shakes (WDSs) induced by baclofen (5mM in 0.2muL of saline) infusion into the dorsal hippocampus; these WDSs were blocked by prior infusion of GABA(B) receptor antagonist CGP55845A.","conclusion":"The partially kindled rats (after 15 ADs) showed a significant decrease in baclofen-induced WDSs as compared to control rats, on days 1, 4 and 21 after kindling. In contrast, kindled and control rats did not show a significant difference in WDSs induced by hippocampal infusion of GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline. Also, the number of WDSs induced after subcutaneous injection of serotonin-2A\/2C agonist+\/-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane was not different between kindled and control rats on 4 and 21 days after kindling. We further tested the hypothesis that the decrease in hippocampal AD-induced WDSs during kindling is caused by a decrease in GABA(B) receptor efficacy. However, we found no convincing evidence to support the latter hypothesis since the AD-induced WDSs were not suppressed by hippocampal infusion of CGP55845A, with the exception that CGP55845A infusion into ventral hippocampus suppressed both hippocampal ADs and WDSs. Together with results derived from previous electrophysiological studies in vitro, it is suggested that a decrease of GABA(B) receptor, possibly GABA(B) autoreceptor, efficacy may explain the decrease of baclofen-induced WDSs after hippocampal kindling."},{"method":"After 4-week of the stress procedure, the rhythmic pattern of rectal temperature in the CMS group was extinguished. In particular, the temperature in the CMS group in the light phase was significantly higher than that in the control group. The plasma corticosterone levels in the CMS group were remarkably increased in the light phase compared to the control group, but not in the dark phase.","background":"The chronic mild stress (CMS) model has been established as a realistic model of depressive disorder as it simulates anhedonia. In the present study, the consumption of sucrose solution was decreased in the rats exposed to CMS, which coincided with many published studies.

Yohimbine pretreatment in the absence of cocaine-associated cues or cues by themselves reliably reinstated responding on the previously cocaine-paired lever (3-4 times higher than extinction levels).","background":"Stress and drug-associated cues can trigger drug desire and relapse in abstinent cocaine users. Although the role of these two factors in relapse is well documented, it remains unclear as to whether an interaction between stress and drug-associated cues can lead to an enhancement in cocaine-seeking behavior.","conclusion":"However, animals showed greatly potentiated responding if yohimbine preceded cue-induced reinstatement (10-13 times higher than extinction levels, or 3-5 times over cues or yohimbine alone). While cocaine self-administration produced a significant increase in plasma corticosterone, plasma corticosterone levels did not show a clear relationship to cocaine-paired lever responding during cue and\/or yohimbine-induced reinstatement. These results demonstrate that exposure to drug-paired cues during a stressful state can greatly potentiate cocaine-seeking and suggest that future treatment interventions should target multiple modalities."},{"method":"In this study we challenged MFB self-stimulation by temporarily inactivating dorsal and ventral VP. We assessed changes in performance capacity and stimulation reward value using the rate-frequency curve shift paradigm.","background":"The ventral pallidum (VP) supports self-stimulation and has anatomical connections that suggest it could be linked to medial forebrain bundle (MFB) self-stimulation. Dorsal VP appears to be more related to dorsal striatopallidum and thus to cognitive control of movement, while ventral VP appears to be more related to linking motivation to action.","conclusion":"VP inactivation, especially in the ventral aspect of the VP ipsilateral to the stimulation site, was more likely to substantially impair maximum response rate than to affect the frequency required to maintain half-maximal responding. These effects were transient, typically disappearing within 20 min following inactivation. Contralateral inactivation was relatively ineffective and bilateral inactivation was surprisingly less effective than ipsilateral inactivation alone, although bilaterally symmetric injection sites were largely confined to the dorsal VP. The fact that inactivation-induced changes in maximum response rate were more prominent than changes in the frequency required to maintain half-maximal responding suggests a role for the ventral VP in linking reward to responding rather than detecting or computing reward value."},{"method":"The present experiments were designed to determine whether both forms of instrumental learning in spinal animals require de novo protein synthesis. As such, we administered various doses of anisomycin intrathecally prior to training. Additionally, spinal rats were trained and tested either immediately or 24 h after test.","background":"Previous research has shown that spinally transected rats will learn to maintain a flexion response when administered shock contingent upon leg position. In short, a contingency is arranged between shock delivery and leg extension so that Master rats exhibit an increase in flexion duration that lasts throughout the training session. Furthermore, when Master rats are later tested they reacquire the flexion response in fewer trials, indicative of some savings. As a control, a second group of spinal rats (Yoked rats) are given shock irrespective of leg position (noncontingent shock). These animals fail to show the same increase in leg flexion duration. Interestingly, when Yoked rats are later tested with a shock contingency in place, they still fail to learn (learning deficit).","conclusion":"We found that only the highest dose of anisomycin (125 microg\/microl) had an effect in Yoked animals that were tested 24 h after training. Specifically, the highest dose of anisomycin reversed the learning deficit in those animals. Moreover, anisomycin had a similar effect when administered prior to training and immediately following training, but not 6 h after training.

Tyrosine hydroxylase staining and apomorphine induced rotation were used to confirm lesion magnitude.","background":"The study of sex differences in the onset, progression and symptoms of Parkinson's disease, in humans, has led to mixed results.","conclusion":"There were no sex differences or lesion effects in the frequency of occurrence of a vertical bout or the average time spent vertical. Both male and female 6-OHDA animals exhibited equal impairments in the use of the forelimbs during vertical exploration. 6-OHDA males, as compared to 6-OHDA females, however, had a significant reduction in the use of their hindlimbs. An analysis of hindlimb step direction revealed that while sham females were more likely to step forward, sham males were more likely to step backwards during a vertical bout. This sex difference was no longer present in the 6-OHDA animals. Finally, 6-OHDA males were significantly more likely to place their dorsal surface in contact with the wall of the cylinder to maintain an upright posture during a vertical bout than animals in any other condition. These results demonstrate that the use of a confined cylinder task is appropriate for the kinematic analysis of sex differences in vertical behaviour and show that there are sex differences in motor behaviour in an animal model of human Parkinson's disease."},{"method":"The aims of the present study were to evaluate gender differential effects of E in the social discrimination paradigm which also involves social olfactory discrimination and in the elevated plus-maze test (EPM) for measuring anxiety.

However, no E effects were found in a test measuring social olfactory discrimination memory and, although they have been mainly measured in males, gender differences have been reported in other tests.","conclusion":"Differential gender E effects appeared in the social exploratory patterns: enriched males showed increased exploratory behaviour towards juvenile rats in comparison to control males, whereas no differences were found in females. No effects of E in social discrimination memory were observed.

The neurochemical analysis showed that acetaldehyde significantly increases the 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid content and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid\/serotonin ratio at the bulb and pons. These results suggest that acetaldehyde modifies the metabolism of serotonin which has been implicated in the onset and sustaining of the sleep episodes occurring along the sleep-wake cycle."},{"method":"To distinguish between these views, the influence of chronic food restriction on brain stimulation reward was assessed in rats bearing multiple stimulation electrodes.","background":"Physiological need states can influence goal-directed behavior by modulating the neural circuitry underlying the rewarding effects of stimuli and behaviors. Direct electrical stimulation of this circuitry produces a powerful rewarding effect, which is called brain stimulation reward. Chronic food restriction resulting in body weight loss potentiates brain stimulation reward, but in only in a subset of cases. This could reflect individual differences between rats or subtle difference in electrode location that lead to differential excitation of functionally different components of the neural circuitry underlying brain stimulation reward.","conclusion":"In 5 of 13 cases, the rewarding effects produced by stimulating different sites in the same rat were altered differentially by weight loss. This finding is interpreted in terms of the subdivision of brain reward circuitry along functional and anatomical lines."},{"method":"We used a single session of footshocks in rats, an animal model with a high degree of validity for PTSD, to study whether individual behavioural traits predict long-term stress-induced sensitisation of behavioural responsivity and somatic pain sensitivity and therefore can act as a vulnerability factor.

Footshocked rats showed increased burying in the electrified prod challenge and no effect was found in the forced swim test. Footshocks caused hyperalgesia in LA rats, but hypoalgesia in HA rats.

In conclusion, decreased level of NO was associated with increased locomotor activity indicating that in addition to genetic differences which may determine changes in locomotor activity in hypertensive rats, the role of a signalling pathway mediated by NO may be supposed."},{"method":"We examined the behavioural, electrophysiological, neuropathological, and biochemical effects of treatment with PPA and related compounds in adult rats. Intraventricular infusions of PPA produced reversible repetitive dystonic behaviours, hyperactivity, turning behaviour, retropulsion, caudate spiking, and the progressive development of limbic kindled seizures, suggesting that this compound has central effects. Biochemical analyses of brain homogenates from PPA treated rats showed an increase in oxidative stress markers (e.g., lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation) and glutathione S-transferase activity coupled with a decrease in glutathione and glutathione peroxidase activity. Neurohistological examinations of hippocampus and adjacent white matter (external capsule) of PPA treated rats revealed increased reactive astrogliosis (GFAP immunoreactivity) and activated microglia (CD68 immunoreactivity) suggestive of a neuroinflammatory process.","background":"Clinical observations suggest that certain gut and dietary factors may transiently worsen symptoms in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), epilepsy and some inheritable metabolic disorders. Propionic acid (PPA) is a short chain fatty acid and an important intermediate of cellular metabolism. PPA is also a by-product of a subpopulation of human gut enterobacteria and is a common food preservative.","conclusion":"This was coupled with a lack of cytotoxicity (cell counts, cleaved caspase 3' immunoreactivity), and an increase in phosphorylated CREB immunoreactivity. We propose that some types of autism may be partial forms of genetically inherited or acquired disorders involving altered PPA metabolism. Thus, intraventricular administration of PPA in rats may provide a means to model some aspects of human ASD in rats."},{"method":"To investigate animal evidence for whether prenatal DEX leads to development of schizophrenia-like phenotypes, Wistar rats were prenatally exposed to DEX (0.1mg\/kg\/day) between the gestational days 15 and 21, and tested in two paradigms known to be disrupted in schizophrenia patients: prepulse inhibition (PPI) and latent inhibition (LI). A cross-fostering design was used to allow dissociation of any direct prenatal effects on offspring from effects dependent on DEX exposure of the rearing dam.","background":"Prenatal stress is an important risk factor in schizophrenia, and the aetiological factors mediating this relationship are central to the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist dexamethasone (DEX) is commonly prescribed for prenatal conditions, and results in GR activation, which is part of the stress response.","conclusion":"Pup birth weight was reduced by prenatal DEX treatment. DEX-treated dams demonstrated increased pup-directed behaviour. There were additive effects of prenatal DEX treatment and DEX treatment of rearing dam in terms of reduced body weight in adulthood. In one of two replications, PPI was increased by prenatal DEX in males only and specific to the highest prepulse intensity. There was no evidence that LI was disrupted by prenatal DEX treatment. This study does not provide support for the hypothesis that prenatal DEX exposure leads to schizophrenia-like deficits in PPI or LI, suggesting that GR prenatal programming is not a mechanism of direct relevance to the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia."},{"method":"The present study examined colony formation in groups of one male and three female mice (Experiment 1) and, groups of three male mice (Experiment 2) of the C57BL\/6J strain in a semi-natural visible burrow system. For adult mixed-sex colonies, 4-h observations during both the dark and light cycles for 15 days demonstrated day-dependent increases in huddling together in the chamber accompanied by decreased frequencies of active social behaviors. Sequential analyses of social interactions indicated that approaches to the back of the approached animal typically elicited flight, while approaches to the front of the approached animal failed to do so. This was seen for female to female, and for female to male approaches, as well as male to female approaches, strongly counterindicating a view that rear approach\/flight specifically reflects female responsivirity to unwanted male sexual approach. For adult male colonies, similar protocols found that these social behaviors were similar to those of adult mixed-sex colonies.","background":"Deficits in social interaction are primary characteristics of autism, which has strong genetic components. Genetically manipulated mouse models may provide a useful research tool to advance the investigation of genes associated with autism. To identify these genes using mouse models, behavioral assays for social relationships in the background strains must be developed.","conclusion":"These findings suggest two potentially useful measures of eusocial behavior in mice, of possible value for genetic mouse models of autism; that is, huddling together and approaches to the front but not the back, of conspecifics."},{"method":"We employed a pattern-based approach to search for episodes of precisely rhythmic activity of single neurons recorded in different brain structures in behaving cats and rabbits. We defined discharge patterns using an algorithmic description, which is different from the previously suggested template methods. We detected episodes of precisely rhythmic discharges, specifically, triads of constant (precision +\/-2.5%) inter-spike intervals in the 10-70 ms range.","background":"Rhythmic discharges of neurons are believed to be involved in information processing in both sensory and motor systems. However their fine structure and functional role need further elucidation.","conclusion":"In 54% (67\/125) of neurons tested, these patterns could not be explained by random occurrences or by steady or slowly changing input. Rhythmic patterns occurred at a wide range of inter-spike intervals, and were imbedded in non-rhythmic activity. In many neurons, timing of these precisely rhythmic patterns was related to different locomotion tasks or to respiration."},{"method":"In the present study, we investigated the effects of UCMS on a battery of different tests measuring anxiety and depression-like behaviors in three behaviorally and genetically distinct inbred strains.","background":"The widely accepted stress-diathesis hypothesis of depression postulates that genetic factors contribute to biological vulnerability. Based on this concept, the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) animal model was developed. Most effects of UCMS can be reversed by antidepressant agents, illustrating a strong predictive validity. In rodents, UCMS also has good face validity as it can elicit depression-like symptoms. While abundant for rats, the UCMS literature on mice is relatively limited. Reports sometimes are contradictory, making it difficult to establish a clear profile of stress-induced depression-like behaviors in mice. As different groups often use different strains for their experiments, differential strain susceptibility to UCMS may provide at least a partial explanation of these discrepancies. Moreover, differences in testing methodology add another level of complexity. Very little is known about the role of genetic factors and their interactions with the environment in the development of stress-induced behavioral changes relevant to depression, though recent studies unequivocally demonstrated the effects of specific gene polymorphisms on stress-induced depressive symptoms, as well as the effects of stress on gene expression.","conclusion":"The goals of these experiments are to obtain a clearer behavioral profile of genetically\/phenotypically distant mouse strains after UCMS treatment and to evaluate the limitations and strengths of the UCMS model in mice."},{"method":"In this study, we used the staircase and single pellet tests to characterize skilled reaching ability after striatal ICH. Rats were trained to reach for food pellets in these tasks before ICH, which was created by infusing 100muL of autologous blood into the striatum. We assessed reaching success in both tasks for 5 days starting 7 and 28 days after ICH. We counted the number of reaching attempts made with each forelimb in the staircase task and performed kinematic analysis of reaching in the single pellet task.","background":"The infusion of autologous blood into the brain of rats is a widely used model of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Careful assessment of functional recovery is an essential part of preclinical testing (e.g., putative cytoprotectants). However, few tests detect long-term deficits in this model.","conclusion":"The contralateral (to lesion) forelimb reaching success was significantly impaired in the staircase task 1 week after ICH, but this recovered to pre-surgical levels thereafter. Reaching deficits in the single pellet task were more severe and persistent. Detailed analysis of reaches on day 11 revealed several abnormalities in the following movement components: pronation, grasping, supinating the paw and releasing the pellet. At 1 month, only digit opening and supination were impaired. Accordingly, the single pellet task is better at detecting long-term skilled reaching impairments in the whole blood model of ICH. Thus, the single pellet task seems suited to cytoprotection and rehabilitation studies."},{"method":"To that end, we quantified the behaviour of 24 rats in several tests. To measure response inhibition, rats were trained in a stop-signal task. In this operant task, rats were rewarded food if they inhibited execution of a response after presentation of an audible stop-signal. Delay aversion was measured in an operant task in which rats made a choice between a small, immediately available reward and a large reward available after a delay.","background":"Impulsivity is an important symptom of many psychiatric disorders, and can be divided into two subtypes: response inhibition deficits and delay aversion. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between delay aversion and response inhibition, both to each other and to locomotion, extinction of conditioned responses, sexual behaviour, and aggressive behaviour.","conclusion":"The results showed that delay aversion and response inhibition were independent. Responses during extinction and various measures of aggressive behaviour were positively correlated to delay aversion. The speed of go-trials in the stop-task was correlated to non-aggressive behaviour. We conclude that the role of response inhibition in various behaviours is small, but delay aversion in particular contributes to several other behaviours, such as aggressive behaviour and extinction."},{"method":"In Experiment 1, it was shown that RT decreases as a function of PI and that this effect varies with amount of training. In Experiment 2, RT was shown to increase during probe trials that used a novel 6.25s PI, suggesting that the specific durations of the PIs encoded during initial training contribute to the PI effect on RT. In Experiment 3, 100 microg\/kg i.p. of raclopride proportionally slowed RT as a function of the PI.","background":"In a series of three experiments, simple reaction time (RT) was characterized with respect to a variable preparatory interval (PI) in order to investigate the relationship between interval timing and RT.","conclusion":"These results are discussed within the context of neuropsychological models of interval timing and support an underlying role for cortico-striatal dopaminergic function in temporal processing and simple RT measurements."},{"method":"A litter of Balb\/cA mice was divided into two groups, with one group weaned at postnatal day 14 (early weaned) and the other at day 21 (normally weaned). Baseline levels of corticosterone, corticosterone response to the moderate stress of exposure to the elevated plus maze test, and hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA expression levels in the mice were assayed at the age of 3, 5, and 8 weeks.","background":"Weaning is one of the most important events in early mammalian life. We investigated the influence of early weaning on the development of neuroendocrine responses to stress in mice. Our study indicated that precocious weaning augments anxiety and aggressiveness in mice, and the lack of mother-pup interaction from postnatal days 15-21 may account for this phenomenon.","conclusion":"At 8 weeks, basal corticosterone levels in early-weaned males were higher than those of normally weaned males. Also at 8 weeks, the early-weaned mice showed a higher anxiety level in the elevated plus maze test, and responded with greater levels of corticosterone secretion than the normally weaned mice. GR expression in the early-weaned mice was higher at 3 weeks but lower at 8 weeks. These GR changes were observed only in male mice. These results suggest that early weaning increases anxiety and enhances neuroendocrine responses to stress and thus modulates the development of the neuroendocrine stress system."},{"method":"In the current study, we used a rodent model for the autism-like behavior of environment exploration deficits to examine the role of the cerebellum and its connectivity to the forebrain. In addition, due to the possible common neural pathways between seizures and autism-like behaviors, we explored the possibility for limiting autism-like behaviors via antiseizure brainstem and cerebellar circuitry. In two experiments, adult male rats showed a significant decrease in exploration behavior following developmental cerebellar suction lesions (experiment 1) or i.c.v. saporin injections specifically targeting Purkinje cells, but not after the addition of saporin-induced cholinergic forebrain lesions (experiment 2).","background":"Clinical observations suggest that abnormalities within the cerebellum and\/or the cerebellum--cholinergic forebrain connections may be key to explain the severe behavioral deficits and increases in seizures seen in autism. In order to explore functional relationships between brain areas implicated in many of the core behavioral features of autism, experiments utilizing animal models for specific autism-like behaviors have increased in recent years.","conclusion":"In both experiments, the anticonvulsant treatment of inhibition of the medullary nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) restored exploration behavior to control levels. These findings suggest that specific neuronal populations within the cerebellum are responsible for mediating exploration behavior, and these neuronal populations are similar to the circuitry involved in limbic motor seizures in that they are sensitive to brainstem inhibition. Furthermore, these results suggest this connection could be utilized in order to control behavioral deficits seen in autism with treatments, such as vagal nerve stimulation, which are effective against pharmaco-resistant seizures."},{"method":"In order to determine which biogenic amine is responsible for this effect, selective dopamine (GBR 12909), serotonin (fluoxetine) or norepinephrine (nisoxetine) transporter inhibitors were systemically administered in order to assess their ability to induce cocaine seeking in rats.","background":"Reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior can be elicited by a systemic priming injection of cocaine or a non-selective biogenic amine transporter inhibitor.","conclusion":"Administration of GBR 12909, but not nisoxetine or fluoxetine, dose-dependently reinstated cocaine seeking in rats. Furthermore, administration of the non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist flupenthixol into the nucleus accumbens shell attenuated GBR 12909-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. These results suggest that increases in extracellular concentrations of dopamine, specifically in the nucleus accumbens shell, are primarily responsible for promoting cocaine priming-induced reinstatement of drug seeking in rats."},{"method":"We tested this hypothesis by injecting either a D2 antagonist (raclopride) or saline in the dominant individual in pair-housed birds for 10 days and examining stress coping ability.","background":"Genetic selection for chickens of high (HGPS) and low (LGPS) group productivity and survivability, resulted in two distinct genetic lines characterized by differences in cannibalism, flightiness, and immunocompetence. Additionally, birds exhibited differences in behaviour and social stress coping strategy. HGPS birds have a superior stress coping strategy compared with birds of LGPS or Dekalb XL (DXL), a commercial strain. Line differences in stress response and behaviour could be due to selection-induced differences in expression of the dopaminergic system. The dopamine (D2) receptor, an integral part of the dopaminergic system, was hypothesized to be a key contributory factor of the stress response.","conclusion":"Results showed that dominant birds of all strains showed a reduced frequency of aggressive pecks on subordinates following raclopride injection. In contrast, subordinates paired with raclopride-injected birds increased pecking frequency. Two days after stopping injections, LGPS and DXL birds returned to pre-injection levels of aggressive threats, while HGPS birds maintained depressed frequency of threats. Strain differences in aggressive responsiveness coincided with increased epinephrine levels in raclopride treated LGPS birds relative to control LGPS birds, but not by HGPS and DXL birds. Our findings suggest a functional linkage between the genetic basis of stress coping ability and the dopamine regulation of aggressive responsiveness. The data further indicate that the sympathetic-adreno-medullary axis is directly involved in regulating both stress coping strategy and aggressiveness."},{"method":"In the present study, rats were given MK-801 before maze exposure and\/or training on this redundant strategy T-maze task.","background":"Evidence that NMDA receptors contribute to synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus has stimulated research on their role in behavioral learning and memory. Recent studies indicate that NMDA antagonists decrease use of place strategies by rats in a T-maze task that can be solved using either a \"place\" or \"response\" strategy.","conclusion":"MK-801 did not impair rats' ability to learn the task, but did change the strategies they used on a probe trial administered after learning. MK-801 decreased use of place strategies only when administered before both maze exposure and training; rats given MK-801 only before maze exposure or only before training tended to use place strategies on the probe trial. These results show that MK-801 does not prevent rats from utilizing previously acquired spatial information, but does appear to impair the acquisition of spatial information needed for place strategies."},{"method":"Chicks were trained to search for food hidden under sawdust in the center of the floor of a square-shaped landmark array, with its center in coincidence with the center of a square-shaped enclosure. Displacement of the array to a corner caused a shift of searching behavior toward the array, the search activity spanning between the center of the arena and the center of the array. After changing distances between landmarks, chicks still searched in the central area. Asymmetries were apparent in chicks tested in monocular conditions, with left-eyed chicks being more affected by the overall enclosure and right-eyed chicks by local landmarks.","background":"Recent evidence suggest that encoding of spatial information based on extended surfaces may differ from encoding based on discrete arrays of local elements. Here we investigated the use of these different frames of reference in domestic chicks.","conclusion":"These results suggest that chicks can use both distances from extended surfaces and local information provided by the landmarks of the array to orient in space. However, chicks do not seem to perceive the array as a whole configuration, rather they tend to rely only on single landmarks to locate the goal."},{"method":"In support of this hypothesis, we have found that both sensitized and haloperidol-treated lactating females exhibited remarkably similar impairments in the expression of all active maternal behaviors relative to lactating dams. Furthermore, these deficits were overridden when they were allowed to interact with 12h-isolated pups (demanding pups). Interestingly, lactating dams also improved their maternal behavior in the presence of demanding pups, and clearly chose demanding more than non-demanding pups in a preference paradigm.","background":"The impairments in the maternal behavior of ovariectomized sensitized females, relative to lactating dams, resemble those deficits found in lactating females after treatment with the D1\/D2 DA receptor antagonist haloperidol, which interferes with maternal motivation. Therefore, it could be speculated that these behavioral deficits found in sensitized females and haloperidol-treated dams are due to a reduced motivation to interact with pups.","conclusion":"These data support the idea that the behavioral deficits of sensitized and haloperidol-treated lactating females are due to a reduced behavioral activation in response to the incentive cues from pups compared to lactating dams, and not because of a motor inability to express maternal behavior. These findings ultimately suggest that pups modulate the activity of DA system involved in the regulation of maternal behavior."},{"method":"The present study aimed to determine whether enhanced spatial working and\/or reference memory in the mother is evident long after weaning and whether these effects are due, in part, to pregnancy or 'mothering' alone. Five groups of age-matched rats: multiparous, primiparous, nulliparous, pregnant-only and sensitized rats were tested approximately 1 month after weaning\/pup-exposure, or 55 days after birth, on the spatial working\/reference version of the radial arm maze.","background":"Pregnancy and motherhood are life-altering events that result in a number of hormonal, neural and behavioral changes in the mother. Motherhood has been shown to influence spatial learning and memory performance of the mother. In turn new research has shown that reproductive experience (number of times pregnant and mothered) plays a significant role on spatial learning and memory performance. How long these changes persist after weaning and the role of pregnancy and\/or mothering on these changes have yet to be fully investigated.","conclusion":"Results show that regardless of error type (reference or working memory errors), primiparous rats make fewer errors compared to multi- and nulli-parous rats, with a trend to enhanced memory compared to sensitized rats. In addition, pregnant-only rats completed the task on significantly fewer days than primiparous, multiparous, nulliparous and sensitized rats. Clearly the combination of first pregnancy and first mothering experience has a significant impact on hippocampus-dependent learning and memory performance in the mother."},{"method":"Presented here is a simple and speculative model of the functions of the subiculum, based partly on anatomical, behavioural and neurophysiological considerations.","background":"The subiculum has a central position between the hippocampus proper and entorhinal and other cortices, as well as a range of subcortical structures. The functional role of subiculum within the hippocampal formation circuit remains largely unexplored and a theoretical and experimental consensus on its functions has yet to emerge.","conclusion":"The model suggests, firstly, that the subiculum acts to amplify hippocampal output, given the prominent bursting behaviour of its neurons and, secondly, that there is a dorso-ventral segregation of function within the subiculum. The dorsal component appears principally concerned with the processing of information about space, movement and memory, whereas the ventral component appears to play a major regulatory role in the inhibition of the HPA axis."},{"method":"We explored prefrontal neuronal activation patterns in resident rats exposed to psychosocial (sensory contact with the intruder) and aggressive encounters.","background":"Violence is associated with prefrontal deficits in humans, suggesting that this brain area inhibits aggressiveness. Its role, however, remains controversial, as certain subdivisions of the prefrontal cortex become activated by fights in rodents. Disparate human findings also show that this area is acutely activated by aggression under certain conditions.","conclusion":"Both psychosocial and aggressive encounters increased c-Fos activation in the prelimbic (PrL), anterior cingular (Cg1), agranular insular (AI), ventral (VO) and lateral orbital (LO) cortices. The infralimbic (IL) and medial orbital (MO) cortices were activated significantly by aggressive encounters only. No other prefrontal regions were activated by psychosocial or aggressive encounters. The overwhelming majority of activated cells were pyramidal (glutamatergic) cells in the Cg1, IL, PrL, MO, and VO, whereas interneuron and pyramidal cell activation was similar in AI and LO. When rats showed violent aggression, the activation of GABAergic inhibitory cells decreased in these two, and two other areas (IL and MO). Notably, the latter two areas appeared to be specifically involved in aggressive behavior. The change occurred in a recently developed model of violent aggression. In this model, pyramidal cell activation in the above mentioned four areas (IL, MO, AI, and LO) predicted over 95% of variation in attack counts in general and violent attacks in particular. Based on these data, we present a tentative hypothesis on the involvement of the prefrontal cortex in the control of aggression."},{"method":"The study used the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) as an animal model. The amount of locomotion activity previously used as an over-activity measure in the SHR has resulted in a complicated picture. While the general activity level of SHR was significantly higher than its progenitor-the Wistar Kyoto rat (WKY), comparative differences with the Wistar rat could be observed only under certain experimental conditions. The present study applied the scaling approach to assess open field behaviors from a qualitative aspect.","background":"Higher testosterone level in males is one of the most obvious possibilities for the development of a clear gender difference in ADHD. The present study focused on the influence of excessive androgen exposure in the developmental stage on the hyperactivity feature of ADHD.","conclusion":"Although SHR and Wistar rats showed similar locomotion amounts, movement patterns differed significantly, as indicated by the spatial scaling exponent. Androgen treatment during the early postnatal developmental stage significantly increased total path lengths only in the male SHR. Effects of the hormone manipulation were not expressed in the scaling measurement. The scaling approach conclusively provides a different aspect of open field behaviors and also reacts differently as the total path length to excessive early testosterone exposure."},{"method":"Male Wistar rats were bilaterally-implanted with guide cannulas aimed at the VH or the DH. One-week after surgery, they received vehicle or lidocaine 2.0% in 1.0 microL (0.5 microL per side) at pre-Trial 1, post-Trial 1 or pre-Trial 2.","background":"The hippocampus has been implicated in the regulation of anxiety and memory processes. Nevertheless, the precise contribution of its ventral (VH) and dorsal (DH) division in these issues still remains a matter of debate. The Trial 1\/2 protocol in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) is a suitable approach to assess features associated with anxiety and memory. Information about the spatial environment on initial (Trial 1) exploration leads to a subsequent increase in open-arm avoidance during retesting (Trial 2). The objective of the present study was to investigate whether transient VH or DH deactivation by lidocaine microinfusion would differently interfere with the performance of EPM-naive and EPM-experienced rats.","conclusion":"There was an increase in open-arm exploration after the intra-VH lidocaine injection on Trial 1. Intra-DH pre-Trial 2 administration of lidocaine also reduced the open-arm avoidance. No significant changes were observed in enclosed-arm entries, an EPM index of general exploratory activity. The cautious exploration of potentially dangerous environment requires VH functional integrity, suggesting a specific role for this region in modulating anxiety-related behaviors. With regard to the DH, it may be preferentially involved in learning and memory since the acquired response of inhibitory avoidance was no longer observed when lidocaine was injected pre-Trial 2."},{"method":"In order to address this, we specifically lesioned the rat rCG1\/rCG2, and assessed the behavioural outcome using a modified forced swim test (FST) and the elevated plus maze (EPM), tests for depression and anxiety related behaviours respectively.","background":"A growing body of functional imaging studies suggests that human depression and anxiety symptoms are associated with functional abnormalities in the circuitry formed by the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and its direct limbic and paralimbic connections. In rodents however, the role of the rACC (rCG1\/rCG2) remains unknown in depression-related behaviours and elusive in acute anxiety.","conclusion":"Lesions of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex significantly increased the time spent immobile in the FST without affecting climbing or swimming performances, suggesting a pro-depressant effect. On the contrary, none of the parameters measured in the EPM was affected by the lesion. These data point to an involvement of the rCG1\/rCG2 in depression-related coping behaviours."},{"method":"We report here on a selective serotonin (5-HT) depletion model of this disorder in neonatal mice that mimics neurochemical and structural changes in cortex and, in addition, displays a behavioral phenotype consistent with autism. Newborn male and female mice were depleted of forebrain 5-HT with injections of the serotonergic neurotoxin, 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), into the bilateral medial forebrain bundle (mfb). Behavioral testing of these animals as adults revealed alterations in social, sensory and stereotypic behaviors.","background":"Autism is a developmental brain disorder characterized by deficits in social interaction, language and behavior. Brain imaging studies demonstrate increased cerebral cortical volumes and micro- and macro-scopic neuroanatomic changes in children with this disorder. Alterations in forebrain serotonergic function may underlie the neuroanatomic and behavioral features of autism. Serotonin is involved in neuronal growth and plasticity and these actions are likely mediated via serotonergic and glutamatergic receptors. Few animal models of autism have been described that replicate both etiology and pathophysiology.","conclusion":"Lesioned mice showed significantly increased cortical width. Serotonin immunocytochemistry showed a dramatic long-lasting depletion of 5-HT containing fibers in cerebral cortex until postnatal day (PND) 60. Autoradiographic binding to high affinity 5-HT transporters was significantly but transiently reduced in cerebral cortex of 5,7-DHT-depleted mice. AMPA glutamate receptor binding was decreased at PND 15. We hypothesize that increased cerebral cortical volume and sensorimotor, cognitive and social deficits observed in both 5-HT-depleted animals and in individuals with autism, may be the result of deficiencies in timely axonal pruning to key cerebral cortical areas."},{"method":"The current study used the non-competitive NMDA antagonist phencyclidine (PCP) and Haloperidol (typical antipsychotic) and Clozapine (atypical antipsychotic) in order to further investigate the influence of DAergic manipulation on a task that requires the use of conditional information to inform goal-directed performance. An instrumental conditional discrimination task was employed in which rats learn to respond appropriately according to the presence of specific auditory conditional stimuli.","background":"Abusers of phencyclidine (PCP) often present with a symptom profile similar to that exhibited by schizophrenic patients. Animal models utilising such psychotomimetics are currently informing research into the condition. Accumulating evidence suggests that a central cognitive deficit in schizophrenia is the inability to use task-setting cues to guide goal directed behaviour and that this ability is mediated by prefrontal dopamine (DA).","conclusion":"Probe test 1 showed impaired conditional discrimination performance following sub-chronic PCP administration (seven twice-daily injection protocol) compared to control which was reversed by acute treatment with clozapine (5 mg\/kg) but not haloperidol (0.1 mg\/kg) both administered 60 min pre-test. Probe test 2 (8 days post-treatment) showed enduring deficits to conditional discrimination performance that were again reversed by clozapine but not haloperidol (injection procedures as above). These results show that tasks dependent upon conditional relationships are particularly sensitive to manipulation of DAergic systems as prolonged treatment with PCP has been shown to selectively reduce prefrontal cortex (PFC) DA activity and treatment with clozapine (known to ameliorate cognitive deficits) but not haloperidol has been shown to selectively restore PFC DA levels."},{"method":"Concerning this possibility two transgenic mouse lines (FVB\/N) have been created: mice over-expressing the bovine form of the alpha-secretase (ADAM10) and mice over-expressing an inactive form of the alpha-secretase (ADAM10-E348A-HA; ADAM10-dn). For behavioral examination a F1 generation of transgenic mice (C57Bl\/6 x FVB\/N (tg)) was generated and compared to wild type F1 generation (C57Bl\/6 x FVB\/N). Behavior was characterized in the following tasks: standard open field, enriched open field, elevated plus-maze, and the Morris water maze hidden platform task.","background":"Members of the ADAM family (adisintegrin and metalloprotease) are the main candidates for physiologically relevant alpha-secretases. The alpha-secretase cleaves in the non-amyloidogenic pathway the amyloid precursor protein within the region of the Abeta peptides preventing their aggregation in the brain. The increase of alpha-secretase activity in the brain provides a plausible strategy to prevent Abeta formation.","conclusion":"Concerning basal activity, exploration, and anxiety, transgenic mice behaved similar to controls. With respect to learning and memory both transgenic lines showed a significant deficit compared to controls. ADAM10 mice however, showed thigmotaxis with passive floating behavior in the Morris water maze indicating differences in motivation, whereas, ADAM10-dn mice displayed an inconspicuous but limited goal-directed search pattern. Thus variation of the enzymatic activity of alpha-secretase ADAM10 alters learning and memory differentially. Nevertheless, it could be concluded that both, ADAM10 and ADAM10-dn mice are suitable control mice for the assessment of alpha-secretase-related effects in animal models of Alzheimer's disease."},{"method":"To elucidate the brain mechanisms of the palatability-induced ingestion, we explored the roles of six hypothalamic orexigenic neuropeptides, orexin, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related protein (AgRP), ghrelin and dynorphin, in the intake of a palatable solution, saccharin. Of the six peptides, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administrations of orexin, MCH and NPY increased the intake of saccharin. Drinking of saccharin in turn elevated the mRNA levels of orexin and NPY, but not MCH. Pre-treatments of naloxone, an opioid antagonist, blocked the orexigenic effects of orexin and NPY. Specific gastric motor responses induced by central orexin-A and NPY are well known, however, MCH did not induce such responses.

However, castrated males did not show an increase in duration of stretch attends (a risk assessment behaviour) in response to TMT. The results of this study suggest that activational levels of androgens in the male rat do not directly regulate the sex difference in stress-induced suppression of hippocampal cell proliferation but do regulate risk assessment behaviour."},{"method":"It was found that not all sensitizing regimens of systemic amphetamine injections produce a US-PEE. In addition, previous exposure to amphetamine in the VTA, where it acts to induce sensitization but not CTA, did not produce a US-PEE.","background":"Previous exposure to amphetamine attenuates its ability to induce conditioned taste aversion (CTA).

TE and EV were injected 30-35 min before training and anastrozole was injected 25-30 min before training.","background":"Neurohormones like testosterone and estrogen have an important role in learning and memory. Many biological effects of androgens in the brain require the local conversion of these steroids to an estrogen.","conclusion":"Our results have shown both TE 80 microg\/0.5 microl and EV 15 microg\/0.5 microl groups increase in escape latency and traveled distance to find invisible platform. Also we have shown that anastrozole dose dependently decreases escape latency and traveled distance. We resulted that both TE and EN impaired acquisition of spatial learning and memory but anastrozole improved it. Anastrozole also could be buffered TE-induced impairment effect but not EV."},{"method":"Twenty healthy subjects had to evaluate, in a word pair matching session, whether two words rhymed (phonological task), were semantically related (semantic task) or were written in the same letter case (orthographic task). Slow wave amplitude was computed in three relevant time windows: the last 0.5 s of first word presentation (W1), the initial contingent negative variation (iCNV) and the terminal CNV (tCNV).","background":"Most of literature on language has shown how different word-classes activate distinct neural networks within linguistic cortical areas. The present investigation aimed to demonstrate that, by means of slow evoked potentials and using the same set of words in different tasks, it is possible to activate cortical networks that are spatially and temporally distinguished.","conclusion":"During W1 and iCNV intervals, both the orthographic and the phonological tasks were left lateralized. Furthermore, the phonological task was more lateralized than the orthographic because of a greater inhibition of the right hemisphere, whereas the orthographic task was characterized by a greater bilateral posterior activation. During the tCNV, only the phonological task remained left lateralized while orthographic and semantic were bilaterally distributed. Although the use of the same set of words tends to activate widely overlapped networks, in the present research task manipulation was effective in demonstrating task dependent differences in brain lateralization. Thus, the present paradigm and the adopted tasks are especially suited for studying deficit and recovery of language in patients affected by linguistic disorders such as developmental dyslexia and aphasia."},{"method":"In this paper, we use muscimol treated rats to investigate the roles of the hippocampal-prefrontal cortical circuits in spatial working memory, as assessed with a delayed spatial alternation task. First of all, the effect of muscimol on EEG power of infusion area was observed for confirmation of the dosage of muscimol to inhibit the function of infusion area.","background":"There is a unidirectional, ipsilateral and monosynaptic projection from the hippocampus to the prefrontal cortex. The cognitive function of hippocampal-prefrontal cortical circuit is not well established.","conclusion":"The results show that the EEG power of the ventral hippocampus and the prelimbic area of the prefrontal cortex were inhibited by local infusion of muscimol (0.5 microg in 0.25 microl PBS) into the above areas, respectively. Delayed alternation performance was significantly impaired when muscimol at this dosage was infused (1) bilaterally into the ventral hippocampus, (2) bilaterally into the prelimbic area, (3) unilaterally into the ventral hippocampus and simultaneously contralaterally into the prelimbic area. Infusion of muscimol either unilaterally into the ventral hippocampus or unilaterally into the prelimbic area did not impair delayed alternation performance. The present results suggest that any structures in this circuit is damaged or inhibited bilaterally, the spatial working memory will be disrupted. It means the hippocampal-prefrontal cortical circuit plays an important role in spatial working memory."},{"method":"In the present study, we determined whether excess maternal COR is also responsible for the alterations in offspring behaviour. Pregnant Wistar rats were adrenalectomized or sham-operated on day 11 of gestation and subjected once daily to mild restraint for 30 min on days 14-21 of gestation. An undisturbed group of pregnant females served as controls. All experiments were performed in male and female offspring. Pup weight and anogenital distance of males were measured after birth; anxiogenic behaviour was assessed in the elevated plus maze (EPM) at the age of 5 weeks and spatial memory in the Morris water maze in littermates at 3-4 months.","background":"Prenatal stress in rats has been shown to impair the regulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and predispose to anxiogenic and depressive-like behaviour. In a previous study, abolition of excess corticosterone (COR) release during stress by maternal adrenalectomy prevented the dysregulation of the HPA axis.","conclusion":"Prenatally stressed (PS) males did not show a reduction in anogenital distance, and their increase in anxiogenic behaviour in the EPM was less than that in PS females. On the other hand, impairment of spatial learning was only seen in PS males. Both the anxiogenic behaviour of PS males and females and the learning deficit in males were completely abolished by adrenalectomy. These data show that excess stress-induced COR can alter the programming of the foetal brain and predispose it to alterations in behaviour that are gender specific."},{"method":"Stable dominant-subordinate relationships developed in most pairs, as measured by feeding time, which were maintained over a 5-6-week study period.","background":"Behavioral and physiological changes were studied following prolonged exposure to social competition in pairs of non-food-deprived rats competing daily for a limited supply of graham cracker crumbs.","conclusion":"In other behavioral tests, subordinates demonstrated a decreased latency to immobility in the forced swim test compared with dominants, but no difference in locomotor activity. Subordinates had increased bladder size, decreased adrenal gland size, and a 35% reduction of hippocampus cell proliferation compared with the dominant member. Therefore, prolonged social competition, based on restricted access to palatable substances, produced hierarchies among individuals that were associated with differences in behavior, physiology and hippocampal cell proliferation."},{"method":"We observed a developmental dissociation with younger children recognizing objects only from previously learnt perspectives whereas older children generalized acquired object knowledge to new viewpoints as well. Haptic and--to a lesser extent--visual priming improved spatial generalization in all but the youngest children.","background":"Spatial generalization skills in school children aged 8-16 were studied with regard to unfamiliar objects that had been previously learned in a cross-modal priming and learning paradigm.","conclusion":"The data supports the idea of dissociable, view-dependent and view-invariant object representations with different developmental trajectories that are subject to modulatory effects of priming. Late-developing areas in the parietal or the prefrontal cortex may account for the retarded onset of view-invariant object recognition."},{"method":"A battery of behavioral tests including radial arm maze, passive avoidance, elevated plus-maze and forced swim test as well as histological methods were used.","background":"Effects of concurrent intracerebroventricular administration of amyloid-beta peptide 25-35 (Abeta(25-35)) and the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) to rats were investigated.","conclusion":"A single administration of Abeta(25-35) induced delayed behavioral deficits manifested in reference and working memory disturbances in the radial maze task involving spatial memory. However, no effects of Abeta(25-35) on learning or retention in a passive avoidance test could be revealed. Abeta(25-35) appeared to decrease anxiety without affecting depression-like behavior in the rats. Abeta(25-35)-induced cognitive deficits could be related to the moderate neuronal cell loss found in the hippocampal CA1 field. Though administration of TNFalpha did not impair learning and memory of rats in the radial maze, it induced gross changes in their behavior during passive avoidance training. Though TNFalpha did not protect against Abeta(25-35)-induced neuronal cell loss in the CA1 field of hippocampus, co-administration of TNFalpha with Abeta(25-35) resulted in an improvement of reference memory impaired by the amyloid peptide, but not of working memory."},{"method":"The common carotid arteries of gerbils were occluded either for 5 min, 10 min, or 15 min.

Each session lasted for 60 min and was composed of six intervals of 10 min.","background":"In addition to morphological changes, global cerebral ischemia leads to functional changes that can be assessed by behavioral examination. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the duration of global cerebral ischemia on the time course of a comprehensive set of motor behaviors in Mongolian gerbils.","conclusion":"Our results revealed that ischemic gerbils quickly develop locomotor and stereotypic hyperactivity, with the expected decrease of resting time. The most evident effect was observed in gerbils submitted to a 15 min ischemia, whose locomotor activity returned to nearly normal values after 7 days. In contrast, the duration of global cerebral ischemia had no effects on rearing, clockwise, or counter-clockwise rotation. These findings indicate that exposure to global cerebral ischemia induces changes in locomotion, stereotypy, and resting time. The magnitude and duration of these effects depend on the duration of ischemia."},{"method":"The En2 knock-out mouse harbors cerebellar abnormalities that are similar to those found in autistic individuals and, as we report here, has a distinct anterior shift in the position of the amygdala in the cerebral cortex. Our initial analysis of background effects in the En1 mouse knock-out provides insight as to possible molecular mechanisms and gender differences associated with autism.","background":"The complex behavioral symptoms and neuroanatomical abnormalities observed in autistic individuals strongly suggest a multi-factorial basis for this perplexing disease. Although not the perfect model, we believe the Engrailed genes provide an invaluable \"window\" into the elusive etiology of autism spectrum disorder.

Female rats were separated for 5 h daily from mother and littermates (early deprivation: ED), separated from mother but not littermates (maternal separation: MS), or animal facility reared (AFR). Male siblings were left with the mother rat during separation. Female rats were exposed to an open field arena either during the juvenile period (PND 30) or during adulthood (PND 80-100).","background":"Separation from the maternal nest alters the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stress response in adult male rats, but little research has addressed how separation affects female rats.","conclusion":"Results show that ED juvenile female rats showed a lower corticosterone stress response than MS and AFR female rats when measured at 5 min post-stress, but no difference at 20 or 60 min post-stress. In adulthood, ED female rats showed comparable elevations of corticosterone as MS and AFR rats at 5 min post-stress but lower elevations at 20 min. In terms of behavior, there were no significant effects of early experience. However, in adulthood, ED and MS rats tended to show a decreased proportion of inner grid crossings of the open field compared to AFR rats, suggesting a tendency for increased anxiety in these two separation groups."},{"method":"In this study we therefore used apomorphine-susceptible and apomorphine-unsusceptible rats, as an animal model for individual differences, to study the effects of cocaine (20, 30 mg\/kg i.p.) on prepulse inhibition. In addition we tested whether the cocaine-induced deficit in prepulse inhibition could be reversed by the D2-antagonist remoxipride (5 mg\/kg i.p.), the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (2.5 mg\/kg i.p.) and the 5-HT2-antagonist ketanserin (2.0 mg\/kg i.p.).","background":"Dopaminergic agonists, such as apomorphine and amphetamine, have been shown to drastically reduce prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex. The effects of the indirect dopamine agonist cocaine on prepulse inhibition have only been described in a few reports and have yielded conflicting results, possibly due to individual differences within and between rat strains.","conclusion":"Cocaine strongly reduced prepulse inhibition in apomorphine-susceptible rats, but had no effect at all on apomorphine-unsusceptible rats. Remoxipride had no effect on prepulse inhibition, but prazosin and ketanserin increased prepulse inhibition. Both remoxipride and prazosin reversed the cocaine-induced deficit in prepulse inhibition, whereas ketanserin did not. We conclude that apomorphine-susceptible rats are extremely sensitive to the effects of cocaine on prepulse inhibition, while apomorphine-unsusceptible rats are not. The effects of cocaine on prepulse inhibition in apomorphine-susceptible rats were mediated by D2-receptors, but not by 5-HT2-receptors or alpha-1 adrenoceptors."},{"method":"In the hot plate test, the NT receptors agonist NT1 (N(alpha)Me-Arg-Lys-Pro-Trp-Tle-Leu), s.c. injected (0.3-3 mg\/kg), increased paw licking and jump latencies. These effects were inhibited by the NTS2 antagonist levocabastine (2.5 mg\/kg, i.p.) but not by the selective NTS1 antagonist SR48692 (3 mg\/kg, i.p.). The opioid receptor antagonist naloxone did not modify (up to the dose of 4.5 mg\/kg, s.c.) the NT1 effect on licking, but abolished the increase in the jump latency (from the dose of 1.5 mg\/kg). In mice made tolerant to the analgesic effect of morphine (2 mg\/kg, s.c.) by previous morphine injections (32 mg\/kg, s.c., twice a day, 4 days), NT1 maintained its effect on licking, but its effect on jump latency was suppressed. Levocabastine (up to the dose of 4.5 mg\/kg) failed to antagonize the effects of morphine (2 mg\/kg, s.c.) on both licking and jump latencies. In mice made tolerant to the analgesic effect of NT1 (0.3 mg\/kg, s.c.) by previous NT1 injections (3 mg\/kg, s.c., twice a day, 4 days) morphine maintained its analgesic effects both on licking and jumping latencies.","background":"The intracerebroventricular administration of the tridecapeptide neurotensin (NT) produces strong analgesic effects in tests evaluating acute pain. We investigated whether these effects are mediated by the opioid receptors.","conclusion":"We can conclude that neurotensinergic and opioidergic transmissions are functionally independent as regards the licking response. However, in the jump response, neurotensinergic transmission seems to regulate opioidergic transmission, inducing its stimulation."},{"method":"To evaluate this question, we conducted a detailed hindlimb kinematic analysis in animals, which suffered complete loss of thermal sensation. Two-dimensional hindlimb kinematics, temporal and spatial measurements, and walking track analysis were performed in rats before and during hypothermic anesthesia.","background":"The influence of reduced feedback from the cutaneous receptors in the hindpaw in rat locomotion is still unclear.","conclusion":"The walking velocity, duration of the step cycle and stance phase, and stride length between the two testing conditions were statistically indistinguishable. Swing phase duration was significantly decreased during sensory loss. Analysis of angular motion revealed an increased hip and knee extension and an ankle joint with increased flexion during the step cycle under plantar anesthesia. Also after plantar cooling, the hip and knee angular velocity was significantly affected along the step cycle. The remarkably geometric similarity of the angle-angle plots obtained in our experiments reflected an interjoint coordination; however, the interpretation of the cyclogram perimeter revealed a larger excursion by the ankle and hip in their respective joint spaces in rats deprived of sensation. Examination of the horizontal position of the ankle with respect to the hip and the extension before toe-off revealed no major changes, whereas, there was a slight decrease in distance of the hip to the ground during sensory loss. Also, the walking tracks revealed a significant functional deficit following reduced cutaneous information of the plantar aspect of the hindpaw. We therefore conclude that sensory feedback from the hindpaw is important in the maintenance of normal rat locomotion."},{"method":"The present study assessed, in infant rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) reared by human caregivers and social interactions with peers, the effects of bilateral neonatal (1-2 weeks of age) ibotenic acid lesions of the amygdala and hippocampus (N=6 in each group), aspiration lesions of the orbital frontal cortex (N=6) or sham lesions (N=5) on the development of a social attachment with the principal human caregiver. A specific preference for the later was assessed at 11 months of age, in a two-choice discrimination task, opposing the principal human caregiver to another familiar human, in a familiar environment.","background":"Non-human primates, like humans, develop and maintain social relationships and attachments throughout their life. The first and most crucial relationship in a primate life is that with its mother. Yet, in absence of their biological mother, infant primates form attachment to surrogate mothers. Although, this early attachment is critical for the development of normal species-typical social and emotional skills, the neural substrates underlying the formation of social relationships in primates are still unclear.","conclusion":"None of the lesions impaired the expression of preferential responses toward the principal human caregiver. Nevertheless, lesions of the orbital frontal cortex led to a weaker preference, suggesting that this structure may play a role in the quality and\/or strength of the infant\/mother relationships. The present non-human primate findings are discussed in terms of their relevance for autism."},{"method":"The present study sought to extend these data by evaluating fear-, anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in male C57BL\/6J mice aged four (early adolescent), six (peri-adolescent) or eight (early adult) weeks of age. Age groups were compared on: Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction, anxiety-like behavior and exploratory locomotion (using elevated plus-maze and novel open field), and depression-related behavior (via forced swim test).","background":"Adolescence is characterized by behavioral traits such as emotional lability and impulsivity that are associated with increased vulnerability to affective illness and addictions. Research in rodents has found that adolescent rats and mice differ from adults on measures of anxiety-like behavior, novelty seeking and stress-responsivity.","conclusion":"Results showed that early adolescent mice exhibited enhanced fear conditioning, but extinguished at a similar rate as adults. There were no major differences in anxiety-like behavior across age groups, although early adolescent and peri-adolescent mice exhibited less exploratory locomotion than adults. Depression-related immobility behavior in the forced swim test was lower in early adolescents than adult mice across three test exposures. Present findings in the C57BL\/6J inbred strain add to growing evidence of changes in rodent fear- and stress-related behaviors across the developmental transition from juvenility through adulthood. Understanding the neural basis of these ontogenic changes could provide insight into the pathogenesis and treatment of affective disorders that have their origins in adolescence."},{"method":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the anxiogenic- or anxiolytic-like effects of an acute administration of antidepressants (serotonergic and noradrenergic compounds) in male Wistar rats submitted to the elevated plus-maze.

Diazepam (0.5, 1.5, 2.5mg\/kg) was used as a positive comparator for anxiolytic effect.","background":"Antidepressants are usually prescribed for the treatment of depression but more recently have also been recommended for the treatment of anxiety disorders.","conclusion":"In comparison with control animals, the percentage of time the rats treated with fluoxetine (5 and 10mg\/kg) and paroxetine (3 and 12mg\/kg) spent in the open arms decreased. The percent of inactive time spent in the open arms also decreased in rats given fluoxetine (5 and 10mg\/kg) and paroxetine (12mg\/kg). Desipramine was inactive on all these parameters. In conclusion, acute treatment with fluoxetine and paroxetine, but not with desipramine, produced a pattern of anxiety behavior. Thus, the pharmacological mechanism appears to be due more to serotonergic than adrenergic neurotransmission. The elevated plus-maze exhibits good sensitivity for detecting anxiogenic effects of antidepressant drugs and the conventional parameters are sufficient and reliable for detecting such effects."},{"method":"We investigated the effect of the nonspecific CRF receptor agonist, ovine CRF (oCRF), injected into the DPAG of mice, in two predator-stress situations, the mouse defense test battery (MDTB), and the rat exposure test (RET).","background":"The midbrain dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG) is part of the brain defensive system involved in active defense reactions to threatening stimuli. Corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) is a peptidergic neurotransmitter that has been strongly implicated in the control of both behavioral and endocrine responses to threat and stress.","conclusion":"In the MDTB, oCRF weakly modified defensive behaviors in mice confronted by the predator (rat); e.g. it increased avoidance distance when the rat was approached and escape attempts (jump escapes) in forced contact. In the RET, drug infusion enhanced duration in the chamber while reduced tunnel and surface time, and reduced contact with the screen which divides the subject and the predator. oCRF also reduced both frequency and duration of risk assessment (stretch attend posture: SAP) in the tunnel and tended to increase freezing. These findings suggest that patterns of defensiveness in response to low intensity threat (RET) are more sensitive to intra-DPAG oCRF than those triggered by high intensity threats (MDTB). Our data indicate that CRF systems may be functionally involved in unconditioned defenses to a predator, consonant with a role for DPAG CRF systems in the regulation of emotionality."},{"method":"In this study, we assessed the neuroprotective effects of the adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonist SCH 58261 on the progressive behavioural alterations reported in the QA rat model of Huntington's disease.

Taken together, the study failed to find evidence that the rat perirhinal cortex is necessary for configural visual discriminations and so revealed that some ambiguous visual discriminations can be learnt when this area is removed. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the parahippocampal region is selectively dedicated to configural learning, even though the loss of this area can impair the acquisition of some configural tasks."},{"method":"Male Wistar rats (3 months of age) were housed in enriched or control conditions during 12 months.

In contrast, handling stress increased significantly the extracellular concentrations of acetylcholine in the PFC of control, but not enriched, animals. Exposing animals to a lit open field during 10min significantly reduced working memory performance assessed immediately in the water T-maze just in control animals, though these effects were not significantly different between both groups of animals. Spontaneous motor activity in the open field was lower in enriched compared to control animals.

As expected, pre-training cocaine dose-dependently produced hyperactivity and disrupted freezing.","background":"Emerging evidence suggests that cocaine and other drugs of abuse can interfere with many aspects of cognitive functioning.","conclusion":"Surprisingly, when the mice were tested off-drug later, the group pre-treated with a moderate dose of cocaine (15mg\/kg) displayed significantly less contextual and cued memory, compared to saline control animals. Conversely, mice pre-treated with a very low dose of cocaine (0.1mg\/kg) showed significantly enhanced fear memory for both context and tone, compared to controls. These results were not due to cocaine's anesthetic effects, as shock reactivity was unaffected by cocaine. The data suggest that despite cocaine's reputation as a performance-enhancing and anxiogenic drug, this effect is seen only at very low doses, whereas a moderate dose disrupts hippocampus and amygdala-dependent fear conditioning."},{"method":"In the present study event-related functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was applied to investigate cerebral blood oxygenation in the right and left prefrontal cortex (PFC) in 15 male participants during the performance of a stop-change paradigm.","background":"Previous lesion and neuroimaging studies have shown that the frontal lobes play an important role in response inhibition.","conclusion":"Data analysis showed stronger brain activation in the left and right PFC during successful and failed stopping of initiated responses in comparison to a condition without stopping. Changes in cerebral blood oxygenation were more pronounced in the right than in the left PFC. No substantial activation changes were found during successful or failed changing of initiated responses (response inhibition and subsequent response re-engagement).

Intrahippocampal insulin microinjection was done 15-20 min before every stress episode. Insulin in low dose (0.5 MU) had no significant effect on memory deficit induced by stress. But in higher doses (6 and 12 MU) insulin protects animals against the deleterious effect of stress. Insulin alone daily injection had no effect on water maze performance.","background":"The presence of insulin receptor in the hippocampus suggests that this organ is a target for insulin. However, unlike the classic peripheral insulin target tissues such as adipocyte, muscle and liver, where the primary function of insulin is to regulate glucose homeostasis, insulin in the central nervous system (CNS) exhibits more diverse actions, most of which have not been clearly understood. A direct role of hippocampal insulin receptor signaling in improving cognitive functions, including learning and memory, and the association of insulin receptor deterioration with brain degenerative dementia (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) have attracted increasing interest. Additionally it has been shown that insulin can be a neuroprotective agent against memory loss induced by ischemia, lesions and some pharmacological agents. In the present study we evaluate the hypothesis that the bilateral intra CA1 insulin injection can protects against stress-induced memory deficit.","conclusion":"These results suggest that spatial learning and memory is compromised during chronic stress and insulin may protect against this effect."},{"method":"The results indicate that elevated Fos expression in the anterior cingulate cortex (Cg) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) correlated positively with preference behavior in all groups.

We also examined whether maternal LG influences offspring behaviour along a continuum by comparing defensive responses of offspring of mid LG mothers to those of offspring of high LG and low LG mothers. A final goal was to assess whether the reductions in adult offspring reactivity to threat that typically follow corticosterone (CORT) administration to dams across lactation are mediated through CORT-induced changes in maternal care.","background":"Natural variations of maternal care in the rat influence the development of neuronal systems that regulate defensive responses to threat. Thus, as adults, rats that received higher levels of maternal licking\/grooming (LG) in infancy display dramatic reductions in burying in the shock-probe test, relative to offspring of low LG mothers.","conclusion":"Adult offspring of high LG mothers spent less time burying the shock-probe, relative to offspring of mid and low LG mothers, whereas offspring of CORT-treated mothers did not differ from any group. Similarly, offspring of high LG (but not CORT-treated) mothers displayed fewer defensive responses in the resident-intruder test. Thus, only natural variations of maternal care were associated with individual differences in offspring reactivity to threat. Furthermore, because offspring of mid and low LG mothers displayed equivalent levels of defensive responding in both tests, it appears that a critical threshold of maternal LG is necessary to alter the developmental trajectory of neural systems mediating defensive behaviours."},{"method":"Nicotine (0.4mg\/kg), amphetamine (AMP, 1mg\/kg), and chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 5mg\/kg) facilitated a goal tracking conditioned response to the discrete CS; however, AMP and CDP did not evoke reliable responding without an interposed stimulus, suggesting that associations between these drug states and sucrose are not expressed as anticipatory food seeking (goal tracking).","background":"Three experiments examined the effects of drug-extinction when a drug state served as a conditional stimulus (CS) for sucrose delivery or as a positive feature for pairings between a discrete CS (e.g., 15-s light-on) and sucrose.

If so, repeated presentation of the drug state alone (drug-extinction) should decrease the CR in both situations.","conclusion":"Repeated presentation of each drug state alone did not disrupt facilitation by nicotine, amphetamine, or CDP; suggesting that the drug states did not facilitate goal tracking based on a direct association with sucrose.

ITIs of 1, 3, 5 and 8min were used in both tasks.","background":"Harnessed bees conditioned to associate odors and sucrose reward learn to discriminate between olfactory mixtures and their odor components in negative (NP: A+, B+, AB-) and positive (PP: A-, B-, AB+) patterning experiments. They thus extend the proboscis to the reinforced (CS+) but not to the non-reinforced (CS-) stimuli.","conclusion":"Increasing ITI resulted in better differentiation between reinforced and non-reinforced CSs in both NP and PP tasks. However, whereas only the longest ITI of 8min allowed discrimination in NP, PP could already be solved with an ITI of 5min. This difference might be due to the fact that NP, but not PP, would require the formation of a unique cue and thus longer processing times. We thus show that the trial-spacing effect, previously demonstrated for single stimulus conditioning, also determines performance in patterning tasks in which three different stimuli (A, B, AB) alternate so that elements have to be discriminated from their compound."},{"method":"Here we report the adult behavioural effects of maternal deprivation (12h on postnatal days 9 and 11) in Wistar rats on paradigms of auditory information processing (prepulse inhibition), sensitivity to dopamimetics (amphetamine-induced hyper-locomotion) and cognition (T-maze delayed alternation and Morris water-maze). In addition, we examined the long-lasting effect of chronic 21-day corticosterone treatment during the post-pubertal period (i.e., postnatal days 56-76) on each of these behavioural paradigms in maternally deprived and control rats. Behavioural testing commenced 2 weeks after the termination of corticosterone treatment.","background":"Prolonged maternal deprivation leads to long-term alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, disturbances of auditory information processing and neurochemical changes in the adult brain, some of which are similar to that observed in schizophrenia.","conclusion":"Maternal deprivation led to a significant reduction in PPI and impaired spatial learning ability in adulthood, but did not affect the behavioural response to amphetamine. Post-pubertal chronic corticosterone treatment did not have any major long-lasting effects on any of the behavioural measures in either maternally deprived or control rats. Our findings further support maternal deprivation as an animal model of specific aspects of schizophrenia."},{"method":"Here, we compared the number of ZENK-labeled cells in song and social behavior nuclei in starlings singing in either a breeding or a non-breeding context.","background":"In songbirds, song learning and production are regulated by the song control system. How the rest of the brain interacts with song nuclei to ensure that song is produced in an appropriate context is not yet clear. In male European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), breeding context song is sexually motivated, whereas, non-breeding context song is more broadly socially motivated. Brain regions involved in regulating social behavior might differentially regulate starling song depending upon the context in which it is produced.","conclusion":"Numbers of ZENK-labeled cells in HVC related positively to song produced in both contexts. Interestingly, numbers of ZENK-labeled cells in one subdivision of the lateral septum (LS) related negatively to breeding context song but positively to non-breeding context song. In a subdivision of the medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTm) ZENK labeling only related positively to non-breeding context song, whereas, in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) ZENK labeling showed a tighter positive relationship with breeding context song. Together, these findings indicate that social behavior brain regions outside of the song control system regulate singing behavior differently depending upon whether song is sexually or more broadly socially motivated. Breeding context-dependent regulation of song by LS, BSTm, and VMH suggests that these nuclei may be central to adjusting song production so that it occurs in response to appropriate social and environmental stimuli."},{"method":"Here, we show impaired spatial memory retention in female mice expressing apoE4 in astrocytes compared to those expressing apoE3 in astrocytes or lacking apoE.","background":"The human apolipoprotein E isoforms, apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4, have differential effects on brain function. Compared to apoE3, apoE4 increases the risk of age-related cognitive decline in humans and female mice expressing apoE in neurons.","conclusion":"Thus, apoE4 impairs cognition whether expressed in neurons or astrocytes."},{"method":"Adolescent AAS-treated hamsters and sesame oil-treated littermates were scored for offensive aggression and then sacrificed 1 day later and examined for the number of FOS immunoreactive (FOS-ir) cells in regions of the hamster forebrain important for aggression control.","background":"Repeated exposure to anabolic\/androgenic steroids (AAS) during adolescence stimulates high levels of offensive aggression in Syrian hamsters. The current study investigated whether adolescent AAS exposure activated neurons in areas of hamster forebrain implicated in aggressive behavior by examining the expression of FOS, i.e., the protein product of the immediate early gene c-fos shown to be a reliably sensitive marker of neuronal activation.","conclusion":"When compared with non-aggressive, oil-treated controls, aggressive AAS-treated hamsters showed persistent increases in the number of FOS-ir cells in select aggression regions, namely the anterior hypothalamus and lateral septum. However, no differences in FOS-ir cells were found in other areas implicated in aggression such as the ventrolateral hypothalamus, bed nucleus of the stria terminals, central and\/or medial amygdala or in non-aggression areas, such as the samatosensory cortex and the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These results suggest that adolescent AAS exposure may constitutively activate neurons in select forebrain areas critical for the regulation of aggression in hamsters. A model for how persistent activation of neurons in one of these brain regions (i.e., the anterior hypothalamus) may facilitate the development of the aggressive phenotype in adolescent-AAS exposed animals is presented."},{"method":"We used a 2x2 factorial design in which rats received sucrose deliveries in one drug state (nicotine or saline) and were then tested in the same state (Nic--&gt;Nic or Sal--&gt;Sal) or a different state (Nic--&gt;Sal or Sal--&gt;Nic) after acquiring the conditioned response.","background":"Past research has shown that when rats received 0.4mg base\/kg nicotine paired reliably with intermittent sucrose delivery that anticipatory sucrose-seeking behavior (i.e., goal tracking) was differentially displayed in the nicotine state relative to intermixed saline sessions in which no sucrose was delivered. The present research extended this observation to a lower dose of nicotine (i.e., 0.2mg base\/kg) and tested a state-dependent learning account of differential conditioned responding. According to this account, the increase in goal tracking on nicotine sessions reflects a chamber-sucrose association that is only recalled when in the nicotine state.","conclusion":"A state-dependency account predicts disruption in conditioned goal tracking for rats that receive a shift in drug state on the test day. This disruption did not occur suggesting that differential control of conditioned responding by nicotine is more likely due to a direct excitatory association between the interoceptive cueing effects of nicotine and the appetitive qualities of sucrose."},{"method":"Therefore, in order to investigate whether developmental indexes of neurobehavioural disorders can be studied in the infant reeler mouse model, and whether ontogenetic adverse experiences may question or improve its suitability, homozygous reeler (RL), heterozygous (HZ) and wild-type (WT) mouse pups underwent maternal separation (SEP, 5h\/day) or handling (H, 3min\/day) on PND 2-6. As expected, a sex difference appeared, for measure of emotional and communicative behaviour in infant mice.","background":"Studies on heterozygous (HZ) reeler mice suggest a relationship between reelin (a protein of extra cellular matrix) haploinsufficiency and the presence of altered neural networks and behaviour. Neonatal adverse and\/or stimulating experiences might interfere with the emergence of this genetic-dependent phenotype. Repeated episodes of maternal separation early in ontogeny result in enduring neuroendocrine, neurochemical and behavioural alterations in the offspring.","conclusion":"On PND 7, compared to other genotypes, RL mouse pups from the H control group, showed reduced levels of ultrasound (USV) production and of locomotion. Surprisingly, this deficit in RL mice was fully reverted by maternal separation. Maternal separation per se reduced social motivation in the homing test at PND 9 in WT mice, with no effects on HZ and RL ones. Additionally, female pups emitted much lower levels of ultrasound production than males within the H control group. Such a baseline sex difference, however, disappeared in the SEP group. The present results provide evidence that unusual stress and related hormonal stimulation early in development may (i) independently shape individual phenotype and (ii) interact with a genetic make-up to substantially modify its \"natural\" developmental trajectories."},{"method":"The hypothyroxinemic TRalpha(o\/o) mice demonstrated behavioral inhibition, manifested in decreased activity and increased anxiety\/fear in the open field test (OFT) and increased immobility in the forced swim test (FST) compared to C57BL\/6J mice.

Thyroid hormone receptors, expressed in brain regions involved in these behaviors, mediate the effects of thyroid hormone deficiency or excess. To determine the contribution of thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TRalpha) in these behaviors, we examined the behavior of euthyroid as well as hypo- and hyperthyroid mice lacking all isoforms of the TRalpha (TRalpha(o\/o)).","conclusion":"These impairments were concurrent with increased thigmotaxis, suggesting an increased anxiety-like state of the TRalpha(o\/o) mice in the MWM. Expression of genes, known to be involved in processes modulating learning and memory, such as glucocorticoid receptor (GR), growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) and neurogranin (RC3), were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of TRalpha(o\/o) mice. GR expression was also decreased in the frontal cortex and amygdala of TRalpha(o\/o) mice, indicating that expression of GR is regulated, probably developmentally, by one or more isoforms of TRalpha in the mouse brain. Taken together these data demonstrate behavioral alterations in the TRalpha(o\/o) mice, indicating the functional role of TRalpha, and a delicate interaction between TRalpha and TRbeta-regulated genes in these behaviors. Thyroid hormone-regulated genes potentially responsible for the learning deficit found in TRalpha(o\/o) mice include GR, RC3 and GAP-43."},{"method":"Based on this, we examined the effects of ketanserin and SCH-23390, antagonists of the 5HT(2) and D(1) receptors, respectively, on the conditioned and unconditioned fear elicited by IC stimulation with SMC.","background":"The inferior colliculus (IC) is involved in processing of auditory information, but also integrates acoustic information of aversive nature. In fact, chemical stimulation of the IC with semicarbazide (SMC) - an inhibitor of the GABA synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase - has been found to cause defensive behavior in an open-field test and functions as an unconditioned stimulus in the place conditioned aversion test (PCA). A question has arisen regarding whether the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) is involved in the acquisition of the aversive information ascending from the IC and whether dopaminergic and serotoninergic mechanisms of the BLA regulate this process. Recent evidence has shown that inactivation of the BLA with muscimol inhibits the PCA and causes an increase in the aversiveness of the chemical stimulation of the IC.","conclusion":"The results obtained confirm the crucial role of 5-HT(2)- and D(1)-mechanisms of the BLA on conditioned fear in that ketanserin and SCH-23390 injections into the BLA caused a reduction in the PCA. On the other hand, ketanserin and SCH-23390 injections into the BLA enhanced the aversiveness of the IC injections of SMC. These findings suggest that while 5-HT(2) and DA(1) mechanisms in the BLA appear to facilitate the conditioned fear they inhibit the unconditioned fear triggered by IC activation."},{"method":"We found that reaching-grasping was impaired in 19 PD patients compared with 19 matched controls, but these impairments were not amplified by stress.","background":"Stress can transiently increase motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), but it is unclear whether other behavioural changes associated with PD are also affected.","conclusion":"However, patients showed a stress-induced reduction of hedonic responses. Stress may amplify those impairments in PD that are not accessible to cognitive control."},{"method":"In the present work, we investigated the short- and long-term effects of a single systemic injection of vehicle, 10, or 1000 units of IFN-alpha on temperature, body weight, food intake, sickness behaviours, locomotor activity, and brain stimulation reward (BSR) thresholds elicited from the ventral tegmental area in female Long-Evans rats. Pioneered for studying motivational processes, BSR has been exploited as a tool for tracking hedonic status in animal models of depression.","background":"Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) is used as a front-line treatment for cancer and other diseases. Reports of depression as a consequence of IFN-alpha therapy scatter the literature, generating interest in the CNS disruptions elicited by this cytokine.","conclusion":"In this study, the main findings were that IFN-alpha did not induce anhedonia as defined by no increase in frequency thresholds. However, the analyses of sickness behaviours unveiled a significant increase in piloerection in all sham control animals that received an IFN-alpha injection while the BSR animal scores remained relatively unchanged between pre- and post-injection days. This pattern was also evident in the overall total sickness behaviour scores. Our data suggest that a single exposure to IFN-alpha treatment in female rats elicits long-term somatic effects, without altering hedonic status."},{"method":"Early rhythmic air-stepping activities by l-dopa injected mice showed similar overall development in both strains;","background":"The development of motor skills was studied at different stages in the life of the mouse, focusing on three key aspects of motor development: early rhythmic motor activities prior to the acquisition of quadruped locomotion, motor skills in young adults, and the effect of aging on motor skills.

Performance on the rotarod by young adult C57Bl6\/j gradually improved between 1 and 3 months, but then declined with age; performance on the treadmill also declined with an age-related increase in fatigability. Overall performance by 129\/sv mice was lower than C57Bl6\/j, and the age-related pattern of change was different, with 129\/sv having relatively stable performance over time.

Interest in novelty in LE chicks is known to be unaffected by light in incubation. Age-dependent effects are also important. RE and LE chicks, which had either the LE or RE exposed to light before hatching, were tested on days 3, 5, 8 or 12 post-hatching, under conditions giving normal fast pecking.","background":"Chicks searching for food grains against a background of unfamiliar pebbles usually peck pebbles less when using the right eye (RE), or both eyes, than when using the left eye (LE), provided that the embryo's RE has been exposed to light (Li), as is normal. When pecking is fast this right\/left difference is mainly due to a heightened ability of RE chicks to inhibit premature pecks (and inappropriate responses in general). Dark incubation (Da) abolishes this ability in RE chicks, and RE and LE chicks show similar frequent pebble pecks.","conclusion":"Artificial exposure of the embryo's LE to light reversed the lateralization: in general, chicks using the light-exposed eye performed well at all ages. Irrespective of which eye system had heightened ability to inhibit pebble pecks, RE performance differed from usual on 2 days, whereas LE chicks showed no age-dependent changes. Changes confined to the RE system, therefore, affect behaviour independently of lateralization of the ability to inhibit inappropriate response."},{"method":"On all trials, each animal pressed a bar and then inserted his snout into a food cup; on half of the trials, food reinforcement was available.

For many cells, a larger burst of activity was seen on the reinforced trials than on trials when rats made the same movements without the presence of reward. There was no evidence that an increase in tactile sensitivity occurred when the animal retrieved the reinforcement.

Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy exhibit psychotic symptoms and disrupted PPI, therefore the present experiments examined the consequences of seizures induced by kindling on PPI.","conclusion":"Kindling of basolateral amygdala, but not perirhinal cortex or ventral hippocampus, disrupted PPI when testing began 2min, but not 48h, following the elicitation of the third class 5 seizure. Startle amplitudes were unaffected by kindling.

However, Long-Evans rats and C57BL\/6J mice may set up different strategies depending on the availability of visual information within the environment. Rats' learning strategies mainly relied on distant visual cues and seemed more efficient than those used by mice as they needed less time than mice to solve the task. We emphasize that the strategies of mice are less robust and flexible than the ones set up by rats.

Brief (80 ms, 25 Hz) TMS trains, given at 150 ms after the onset of cutaneous stimulation, significantly impaired subjects' ability in localizing non-nociceptive, tactile input, an effect which was not observed when TMS was applied at 300 ms after cutaneous stimulation. In contrast, brief TMS trains given at 300 ms after the onset of cutaneous stimulation significantly impaired subjects' ability in localizing nociceptive input, an effect which was not observed when TMS was applied at 150 ms after cutaneous stimulation. No impairment in stimulus detection was found in comparison with control sham TMS.","background":"The cortical system underlying perceptual ability to localize tactile and noxious cutaneous stimuli in humans is still incompletely understood.","conclusion":"The timing of parietal TMS interference with the ability to localize tactile and painful stimuli is compatible with known time differences in the arrival of non-noxious and noxious information in the postcentral gyrus. On these grounds, our findings support the existence of overlapping cortical populations in the contralateral parietal lobe, exerting a role in spatial discriminative aspects of touch and mechanically induced pain."},{"method":"To investigate whether T. gondii infection induces selective effects on behavior associated with anxiety, Wistar rats were inoculated i.p. with several doses of T. gondii tachyzoites and tested in two animal tests of anxiety.","background":"It has been suggested that the parasite Toxoplasma gondii reduces the fear of rodents toward their feline predators, which may lead to an augmented rate of predation and multiplication of the parasite through an increased number of life cycles.","conclusion":"In the third week following inoculation, rats infected with 100 and 1000 tachyzoites increased plus-maze open arm exploration in a dose-related manner. However, no effect was detected in either social interaction levels or motor activity measures. In the seventh week after inoculation, rats infected with 100 and 1000 tachyzoites showed increased open arm exploration and social investigation without change on any motor activity measures. However, rats infected with a higher dose (1500 tachyzoites) showed a drop in locomotion. These data support the hypothesis that T. gondii impairs mechanism of warning as a function of reduced anxiety. The pattern of brain colonization by the parasite and the host immune response suggests that the predominant invasion to limbic areas works as a natural anxiolytic mechanism."},{"method":"We observed spontaneous motor activities and spatial memory task of mice using pyroelectric infrared sensor and programmed video tracking system, respectively.

Further, radiation-induced deficit of total, nonprotein and protein-bound sulfhydryl (T-SH, NP-SH, PB-SH) contents of cerebellum and plasma ferric reducing power (FRAP) was also inhibited by alpha-lipoic acid pre-treatment. Moreover, alpha-lipoic acid treated mice showed an intact cytoarchitecture of cerebellum, higher counts of intact Purkinje cells and granular cells in comparison to untreated irradiated mice.

Brain-injured mice were evaluated for anterograde cognitive deficits, with the hypothesis that acute injury-induced impairments improve over time. Male C57BL\/6J mice were brain-injured, trained at 5 or 27 days post-injury, and tested 48h later for recall of the association between the conditioned stimuli (trained context or cue) and the unconditioned stimulus (foot shock) by quantifying fear-associated freezing behavior.","background":"Conditioned fear associates a contextual environment and cue stimulus to a foot shock in a single training trial, where fear expressed to the trained context or cue indicates cognitive performance. Lesion, aspiration or inactivation of the hippocampus and amygdala impair conditioned fear to the trained context and cue, respectively. Moreover, only bilateral experimental manipulations, in contrast to unilateral, abolish cognitive performance.","conclusion":"A significant anterograde hippocampal-dependent cognitive deficit was observed at 7 days in brain-injured compared to sham. Cued fear conditioning could not detect amygdala-dependent cognitive deficits after injury and stereological estimation of amygdala neuron number corroborated this finding. The absence of injury-related freezing in a novel context substantiated injury-induced hippocampal-dependent cognitive dysfunction, rather than generalized fear. Variations in the training and testing paradigms demonstrated a cognitive deficit in consolidation, rather than acquisition or recall. By 1-month post-injury, cognitive function recovered in brain-injured mice. Hence, the acute injury-induced cognitive impairment may persist while transient pathophysiological sequelae are underway, and improve as global dysfunction subsides."},{"method":"Adrenalectomy ('ADX': surgical removal of the adrenal glands) was performed in a subset of animals to investigate the contribution of the adrenals.

By contrast, cocaine attenuated corticosterone responses in C57BL\/6 mice throughout the sensitisation paradigm. We have therefore identified one strain, the DBA\/2 strain, that displays parallel sensitisation of cocaine-induced locomotion and -corticosterone secretion. Most interestingly, ADX prevented locomotor sensitisation only in DBA\/2 mice, suggesting that behavioural sensitisation depends on the integrity of adrenal function and on secretion of adrenal glucocorticoids in this strain. The present results demonstrate that adrenal stress hormones facilitate behavioural sensitisation to cocaine in a genotype-dependent manner and suggest that glucocorticoids contribute to strain differences in psychostimulant sensitivity."},{"method":"On the first day quinpirole completely suppressed operant behavior, which however progressively increased in the subsequent sessions, approaching control levels by day 6.

Thirty minutes later they were subjected to 2 min of cooling on a 20 degrees C surface and their USVs were quantified.","background":"The sensitivity of prenatally malnourished rats to the ultrasonic vocalization (USV) suppressant effect of diazepam (a non-specific benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor agonist) was investigated.","conclusion":"DZ dose-dependently suppressed USV at both ages. At P7, the USV suppressant effect of DZ was the same for both groups. However, by P11 the prenatally malnourished rats showed significantly greater suppression of USV by 0.03 and 0.1mg\/kg DZ than well-nourished controls. These differences were not related to degree of temperature loss or body weight. Thus, differential sensitivity to BZ receptor agonists develops in the second postnatal week in prenatally malnourished rats. This reflects either an altered program of development of the GABAergic system, or adaptive, compensatory changes in the GABAergic system in response to more extensive functional disturbances in the developing brain."},{"method":"To investigate whether lithium improves the behavioral disorder induced by transient global cerebral ischemia, we examined the effects of lithium treatment on the performance of rats in a set of behavioral tests, i.e. beam balance, elevated plus maze (EPM), open field and Morris water maze.","background":"Previous study has indicated that chronic treatment with lithium protects brain against ischemic injury by reducing apoptotic death.","conclusion":"Our results showed that lithium attenuated the worse general 'well-being' and the worse performance in beam balance, and hyperactivity in EPM and open field, including increased open arm entries, time spent in the open arms, squares crossed, rearing and grooming over 7 days after 15min ischemia, which were induced by four-vessel occlusion in Sprague-Dawley rats. Moreover, lithium improved the injured spatial learning and memory ability in Morris water maze at post-ischemic days 8 and 9. Histological analysis displayed that it decreased obviously cell death in hippocampal CA1 region. Our study further confirmed the protective role of lithium in the ischemia-reperfusion injury and suggested that lithium might be a helpful therapeutic approach to the treatment of stroke combining with other neuroprotective agents."},{"method":"In a novel home-cage, no behavioural differences were found between LE- and HE-rats, suggestive that it is not the general locomotor activity but specific features of the exploration box test that bring about the differences. In studies on both Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats we found that the trait of exploratory activity remains stable over long periods of time and that LE and HE animals display differences in many other behavioural tests related to mood disorders.","background":"Behaviour in novel environments is influenced by the conflicting motivators fear and curiosity. Because changes in both of these motivational processes are often simultaneously involved in human affective disorders, we have developed the exploration box test which allows separation of animals belonging to clusters with inherent high neophobia\/low motivation to explore and low neophobia\/high motivation to explore (LE and HE, respectively).","conclusion":"Namely, LE animals were found to display enhanced anxiety-like behaviour and to be generally less active in the elevated plus-maze, used more passive coping strategies in the forced swimming test, and acquired a more persistent association between neutral and stressful stimuli in fear conditioning test. LE animals consumed more sucrose solution in non-deprived conditions. We also found that both at baseline and in response to d-amphetamine (0.5mg\/kg) administration, LE-rats had lower extracellular dopamine levels in striatum but not in nucleus accumbens.

In rodents, anxiety is inferred by examining anxiety-related behavioral responses such as avoidance and freezing, and more infrequently by assessing autonomic responses to anxiogenic stimuli. However, few studies have simultaneously measured behavioral and autonomic responses to aversive stimuli in rodents and it remains unclear whether autonomic measures are reliable correlates of anxiety-related behavior in these animal models.","conclusion":"Our data show that upon exposure to a novel open field, BALB\/c mice showed increased anxiety-related behavior, reduced heart rate and higher heart rate variability (HRV) when compared with C57BL\/6 mice. Regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between both heart rate and long-term HRV measures and locomotor activity and time spent in the center of the open field, but no correlation between body temperature and any behavioral variables. In the free exploration test, in which animals were allowed direct access to a novel environment from a familiar environment without experimenter handling, significant correlations were found only between heart rate and total locomotor activity, but not time spent in the unfamiliar chamber despite increased anxiety-related behavior in BALB\/c mice. These findings demonstrate that increased anxiety-related behavior in BALB\/c mice is not associated with specific changes in heart rate, HRV, or body temperature."},{"method":"However, summation and retardation tests fail to reveal these associations because (a) the CX is not attended or (b) a CX-CS configural stimulus formed during extinction is both poorly attended and weakly active during testing. When US presentations and testing occur in the same context, reinstatement is the consequence of a decreased CX inhibition and the increased attention to the CS, which activates the remaining CS-US association. When US presentations occur in the context of extinction but the CS is tested in a different context, reinstatement results from an increased attention to the CS and the combination of CS-CX and CX-US excitatory associations.","background":"An existing attentional-associative model of classical conditioning [Schmajuk N, Lam Y, Gray JA. Latent inhibition: a neural network approach. J Exp Psychol: Anim Behav Process 1996;22:321-49] is applied to the description of reinstatement in animals and humans. According to the model, inhibitory associations between the context (CX) and unconditioned stimulus (US) are formed during extinction, which help preserve the association between the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the US.","conclusion":"The assumption that associations between CSs are impaired following neurotoxic hippocampal lesions or in amnesia, is sufficient to describe absence of reinstatement in those cases. However, additional assumptions might be needed to describe the effect of hippocampal lesions on other postextinction manipulations."},{"method":"We therefore examined basal forebrain choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) immunohistochemistry, nicotinic receptor binding in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and working memory, in male rats tested on a delayed matching to place (DMP) task in the water maze following exposure to either room air (RA) or intermittent hypoxia (IH; alternating 90s epochs of 21% and 10% O(2) during sleep).","background":"Exposure to intermittent hypoxia (IH), such as occurs in sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), is associated with cognitive impairment, neurodegeneration, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses within rodent brain regions such as the basal forebrain. In this region, damage to cholinergic neurons correlates with working memory deficits in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, suggesting that degeneration of cholinergic systems may also contribute to the working memory impairments observed after IH exposures.","conclusion":"IH-treated animals displayed impaired working memory with respect to controls, along with significant reductions in CHAT-stained neurons in the medial septal nucleus, in both the vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band, and the substantia inominata after 14 days of IH exposure. In addition, increases in nicotinic binding and receptor affinity in the PFC were observed after 14 days of IH exposure. Thus, a loss of cholinergic neuronal phenotype in the basal forebrain may contribute to the cognitive impairments associated with CIH exposure. However, compensatory mechanisms may also be activated in other brain regions, and may provide potential therapeutic targets for the cognitive impairments associated with SDB."},{"method":"In a recent study, we have demonstrated that the 5-HT(2A\/2C) agonist DOI and the 5-HT(2B) agonist BW 723C86 were shown to produce an anxiolytic-like effect in both tests. This study aimed to evaluate a putative interaction between benzodiazepine and 5-HT(2) ligands in the FPT and the EPM.","background":"Animal models of anxiety remain a useful tool for evaluating the anxiolytic-like effect of new treatments. Even though many tests are similarly based on exploration tasks, using more than one animal model is all the more recommended since there are qualitative differences between such tests. Furthermore, although many tests are excellent tool for detecting benzodiazepines\/GABA compounds, inconsistent results have been reported for 5-HT ligands. Here, two animal models have been chosen, the elevated plus maze (EPM) based on the natural aversion of rodents for open spaces and the four-plates test (FPT) a models involving the animal's conditioned response to stressful events.","conclusion":"Indeed, close distribution of GABA(A) and 5-HT(2) receptors was found in brain structures leading to functional interrelation. In the FPT, sub-active doses of alprazolam and diazepam were strongly potentiated by DOI. BW 723C86, also potentiated the anxiolytic-like effect of the two benzodiazepines with a weaker effect. In the same way, DOI and benzodiazepines administration induced an increase in the anxiolytic-like parameters in the EPM with a strongest effect observed with alprazolam. Regardless of anxiety models used in this study, 5-HT(2A) ligands exerted facilitatory influence upon GABAergic system. Therefore, the FPT and the EPM might implicate the same kind of anxiety."},{"method":"C57BL\/6J mice were trained to self-administer METH (0.1mg\/kg\/infusion) by poking their nose into an active hole under a fixed ratio schedule in daily 3-h sessions. After acquiring stable METH self-administration behavior, the mice were subjected to extinction training in the absence of both METH and METH-associated cues. Once the active nose-poking responses were extinguished, drug-primed and cue-induced reinstatement were investigated according to a within-subjects design.","background":"It is essential to develop animal models to study the role of genetic factors in the relapse of drug-seeking behavior in genetically engineered mutant mice. This paper reports a typical model of drug-primed and cue-induced reinstatement of extinguished methamphetamine (METH)-seeking behavior in mice.","conclusion":"A priming injection of METH reliably reinstated the extinguished drug-seeking behavior in the absence of both METH and METH-associated cues. Interestingly, the drug-primed METH-seeking behavior disappeared within 2 months after withdrawal from METH, while cue-induced reinstatement of extinguished METH-seeking behavior lasted for at least 5 months after the withdrawal. A correlation study revealed that drug-primed, but not cue-induced, reinstatement behavior was positively correlated with the total amount of METH taken by individuals during METH self-administration. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the present reinstatement procedure for mouse model of relapse is useful and reliable, and different neural mechanisms may be involved in drug-primed and cue-induced METH-seeking behavior."},{"method":"Under breeding (BS) or non-breeding (NBS) environmental conditions, male green anoles were implanted with either T or blank capsules and exposed to one of three female stimulus conditions: physical, visual or no female contact.","background":"Interactions among reproductive season, testosterone (T) and female presence were investigated on the structure and function of forebrain and neuromuscular systems controlling courtship and copulation in the green anole lizard.","conclusion":"T and at least visual exposure to females increased courtship displays (extension of a throat fan, or dewlap), and these effects were greater during the BS than NBS. T also facilitated copulation, and did so to a greater extent in the BS. The hormone increased soma size in the preoptic area (POA) and amygdala (AMY), and in the AMY the effects were greater in the BS than NBS. Cross-sectional areas of copulatory organs and associated muscle fibers were enhanced by T, and more so in the BS than NBS. However, no effects on morphology of dewlap motoneurons or muscles or copulatory motoneurons were detected. Thus, (1) changes in behavior and neural and\/or muscular morphology are not always parallel and (2) differences in responsiveness to T exist across seasons and among tissues."},{"method":"Examining the ability to selectively breed rats for high and low PPI, results showed significant differences of PPI scores within two generations. Comparing antipsychotics to restore PPI of the low group, haloperidol was shown more effective than clozapine.","background":"Deficient sensorimotor gating, measured as prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle, reflects disturbed information processing found in neuropsychiatric disorders.","conclusion":"This suggests low PPI rats may be useful models for neuropsychiatric disorders and screening antipsychotics."},{"method":"Compared with neutral condition, the response of oxy-HB for men yielded no significant difference during stress period, but the response induced by stress pictures for women showed significant enhancement.","background":"Presentation of negative pictures was used as emotional stress to assess gender differences in prefrontal area activation in a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) study.","conclusion":"It was indicated that it is crucial to take gender difference into account when negative stimuli are used in functional brain imaging."},{"method":"L-DOPA treatment resulted in a significant loss of motoneurones to the slow SOL muscle, but not to the fast TA and EDL muscles. Moreover, motoneurones to fast muscles also die as when exposed to increased activity in early life, if their axons are repeatedly injured.","background":"We have investigated the effect of precociously increasing locomotor activity during early postnatal development by daily treatment with the monoaminergic precursor L-DOPA on the survival of motoneurones supplying the slow soleus (SOL) muscle and the fast, tibialis anterior (TA) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles as well as the contractile and histochemical properties of these muscles.","conclusion":"The loss of normal soleus motoneurones was accompanied by an increase in force of the remaining motor units and sprouting of the surviving axons suggesting a remodelling of motor unit organisation. The time to peak contraction of both SOL and EDL muscles from L-DOPA treated rats was prolonged at 8 weeks of age. At 4 weeks the soleus muscles of the L-DOPA treated animal developed more tension than the saline treated one. This difference between the two groups did not persist and by 8 weeks of age the muscle weight and tetanic tension from either group were not significantly different from control animals. The present study shows that early transient, precocious locomotor activity induced by L-DOPA is damaging to normal soleus but not to normal EDL\/TA motoneurones."},{"method":"Here we revealed that reduction of lesion-induced neurogenesis in VMN impaired the behavioral recovery suggesting therefore a causal link between neurogenesis and behavioral recovery.","background":"We have previously shown that electrolytic lesion-induced neurogenesis in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN) is significantly correlated with the recovery of courtship behavior in adult male ring doves.","conclusion":"Our results lend support that adult neurogenesis is latent in repair of injured brain."},{"method":"We report the development of a modified ladder beam instrument and scoring system to measure hindlimb recovery in vertebral T9 contusion spinal cord injured mice. The mouse ladder beam allows for the use of standard parametric statistical tests to assess locomotor recovery.","background":"Locomotor impairments after spinal cord injury (SCI) are often assessed using open-field rating scales. These tasks have the advantage of spanning the range from complete paralysis to normal walking; however, they lack sensitivity at specific levels of recovery. Additionally, most supplemental assessments were developed in rats, not mice. For example, the horizontal ladder beam has been used to measure recovery in the rat after SCI. This parametric task results in a videotaped archival record of the event, is easily administered, and is unambiguously scored. Although a ladder beam apparatus for mice is available, its use in the assessment of recovery in SCI mice is rare, possibly because normative data for uninjured mice and the type of step misplacements injured mice exhibit is lacking.","conclusion":"Ladder beam performance is consistent across four strains of mice, there are no sex differences, and inter-rater reliability between observers is high. The ladder beam score is proportional to injury severity and can be used to easily separate mice capable of weight-supported stance up to mice with consistent forelimb to hindlimb coordination. Critically, horizontal ladder beam testing discriminates between mice that score identically in terms of stepping frequency in open-field testing."},{"method":"The non-cognitive behaviour of the hAPP\/PS1 transgenic mouse model (TASTPM) was observed at ages spanning the rapid progression of amyloid neuropathology.","background":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by progressive cognitive impairment with neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anomalous motor behaviour, depression, anxiety, weight loss, irritability and agitation. The effect of hAPP and PS1 overexpression on cognition has been well characterised in a variety of transgenic mouse models, however, non-cognitive behaviours have not been considered as systematically.","conclusion":"TASTPM transgenic mice, of both genders, exhibited decreased spontaneous motor activity, disinhibition, increased frequency and duration of feeding bouts, reduced body weight and, by 10 months, increased activity over a 24h period. In addition to the aforementioned behaviours, male transgenic mice also displayed enhanced aggression relative to wildtype controls. These data reveal previously unreported disease relevant behavioural changes that demonstrate the value of measuring behaviour in APP\/PS1 transgenic models. These behavioural readouts could be useful in screening putative drug treatments for AD."},{"method":"By using elevated plus-maze test, we studied the changes of serum nitrate and nitrite (NO(x)) levels in comparison to the estrous cycle-dependent changes of anxiety state. Then, we tested the effects of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, L-NAME (10, 60mg\/kg, i.p.), and the NO precursor, l-arginine (100mg\/kg, i.p.) on anxiety modulatory properties of exogenous ovarian hormones in ovariectomized (OVX) rats.","background":"Nitric oxide (NO)\/cGMP pathway is known as a mediator in anxiety modulation. In this study, we assessed the involvement of NO pathway in the estrous cycle-related changes of anxiety level in rat.","conclusion":"Compared with other cycle phases and with OVX rats, cycling rats spent more time in open arms and had lower levels of serum NO(x) levels during metestrous while they spent less time in open arms and had lower levels of serum NO(x) levels during proestrous. In OVX rats, L-NAME (60mg\/kg, i.p.) exerted anxiolytic effect while l-arginine showed no effect. In comparison with corn oil-treated controls, estradiol benzoate (10microg\/kg, subcutaneously (s.c.)) significantly increased the serum NO(x) level and exerted anxiogenic effect, which was dose-dependently inhibited by L-NAME but was not changed by l-arginine. In contrast, progesterone (25mg\/kg, s.c.) significantly decreased the serum NO(x) level and exerted anxiolytic effect, which was abolished by l-arginine but was not affected by L-NAME. These findings suggest that NO system might be involved in the estrous cycle-related changes of anxiety level, probably by mediating the effect of ovarian sex hormones."},{"method":"In the present study, we used the intact-pretraining paradigm, in which animals were trained to the task prior to the injections and subsequently retrieval and reacquisition of AAPA while under the effects of the drugs was tested.","background":"Dopaminergic neurotransmission is considered to modulate cognitive processes, including spatial memory.

Using a behavioural paradigm measuring spatial visual attention, we tested the effects of photothrombotic infarction to either the frontal cortex or the parietal cortex on attention performance. Since the cholinergic system is known to modulate attention performance, we additionally evaluated the role of cholinergic receptor blockade with scopolamine in our task paradigm.","background":"The syndrome of hemispatial neglect is defined as an inability to report, respond or orient to stimuli contralateral to a cerebral lesion despite intact elementary sensory or motor function. This syndrome is typically observed after lesions of the right cerebral cortex, and has been associated with impairment of attention.","conclusion":"Our results show a transient response bias immediately after cortical infarction, with a decrease in contralesional responses and an increase in contralesional omissions after frontal infarction. Parietal infarction and systemic administration of scopolamine also resulted in a decrease in correct responses and an increase in omissions, but without a difference in side responding. In conclusion, right frontal infarction induces a transient impairment in contralesional spatial visual attention that we explain as left-sided neglect. Right parietal infarction and cholinergic blockade shows non-lateralized deficits in spatial visual attention, suggestive of global attentional impairment. We postulate that both effects of cortical infarction on attention performance may be related to cholinergic dysfunction. Our study confirms the role of frontal and parietal cortices in attention performance in rats, and corroborates the theory that attention performance is impaired in hemispatial neglect in human stroke patients."},{"method":"Adult Long-Evans male rats were implanted with guide cannulae targeted at the lateral amygdala and were microinjected with standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid with or without various doses of strychnine or taurine. Anxiety-like behaviors were assessed with the elevated plus maze or the light\/dark box.","background":"Strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors are expressed in many adult forebrain regions, yet the biological function of these receptors outside the spinal cord\/brainstem is poorly understood. We have recently shown that rat lateral\/basolateral amygdala neurons express strychnine-sensitive glycine-gated currents whose pharmacological and molecular characteristics are consistent with those established for classic ligand-gated chloride channels. The current studies were undertaken to establish the behavioral role, if any, of these strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors.","conclusion":"In the elevated plus maze, strychnine decreased closed-arm time and increased open-arm time, suggestive of an anxiolytic effect. Similarly, strychnine produced a modest anxiolytic effect in the light\/dark box. Post hoc analysis of 'open-arm' time and 'light-side' time indicated that aCSF-treated animals were distributed into two apparent groups that displayed either high or low amounts of anxiety-like behavior in a given apparatus. Surprisingly, the pharmacological effects of both strychnine and taurine in these assays were dependent upon a given animal's behavioral phenotype. Together, these findings are significant because they suggest that the basal 'emotional state' of the animal could influence the behavioral outcome associated with drug application directly into the lateral\/basolateral amygdala. Furthermore, our findings also suggest that compounds acting at amygdala strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors may actively modulate this basal anxiety-like state."},{"method":"The present study investigated the effects of the 5-HT(2B\/2C) receptor agonist mCPP bilaterally microinjected into the dorsal hippocampus (DH: 0, 0.3, 1.0 or 3.0nmol\/0.2microl), the ventral hippocampus (VH: 0, 0.3, 1.0 or 3.0nmol\/0.2microl) or the amygdaloid complex (0, 0.15, 0.5, 1.0 or 3.0nmol\/0.1microl) in mice exposed to the elevated plus-maze (EPM). Test sessions were videotaped and subsequently scored for conventional indices of anxiety (percentage of open arm entries and percentage of open arm time) and locomotor activity (closed arm entries).","background":"Serotonin (5-HT) can either increase or decrease anxiety-like behaviour in animals, actions that depend upon neuroanatomical site of action and 5-HT receptor subtype. Although systemic studies with 5-HT(2) receptor agonists and antagonists suggest a facilitatory role for this receptor subtype in anxiety, somewhat inconsistent results have been obtained when such compounds have been directly applied to limbic targets such as the hippocampus and amygdala.","conclusion":"Results showed that mCPP microinfusions into the DH or VH failed to affect any behavioural measure in the EPM. However, when injected into the amygdaloid complex, the dose of 1.0nmol of this 5HT(2B\/2C) receptor agonist increased behavioural indices of anxiety without significantly altering general activity levels. This anxiogenic-like effect of mCPP was selectively and completely blocked by local injection of a behaviourally-inactive dose of SDZ SER-082 (10nmol\/0.1microl), a preferential 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist. These data suggest that 5HT(2C) receptors located within the amygdaloid complex (but not the dorsal or ventral hippocampus) play a facilitatory role in plus-maze anxiety in mice."},{"method":"Changes in performance capacity and stimulation reward effectiveness were evaluated with the rate-frequency curve shift paradigm. When infused into the lateral and medial septum and the vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca, both doses of muscimol were as ineffective as saline in altering either the rats' maximum rate of response for stimulation or the frequency required to maintain half-maximal response rate (required frequency). However, when infused into the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca or the magnocellular preoptic area, muscimol substantially decreased maximal response rate and modestly increased required frequency. Changes in maximum rate were dose-dependent, but changes in required frequency were not. Muscimol infusions contralateral to the stimulated hemisphere were as effective as ipsilateral infusions; bilateral infusions tended to so suppress responding that resulting rate-frequency curves were often invalid.","background":"Elements of the septo-preoptic basal forebrain complex, particularly the lateral and medial septum, the diagonal band of Broca, and the magnocellular preoptic area, have been linked to medial forebrain bundle (MFB) self-stimulation.

As such, the use of the guinea pig to model infection may provide a useful alternative model of human pregnancy to explore programming effects."},{"method":"Here, we report that V1aR knockout (KO) mice exhibited impairment of social behavior in a social interaction test, and showed reduced anxiety-related behavior in elevated plus-maze and marble-burying behavior tests.","background":"The arginine vasopressin (AVP) system plays an important role in social behavior. Autism, with its hallmark disturbances in social behavior, has been associated with the V1a receptor (V1aR) gene.

Previous reports indicated that lesioning or inactivating the IO abolishes conditioned eyeblinks (CRs), but there was disagreement regarding the timing of the CR performance deficit. As a result, it was not clear whether IO inactivation produces unlearning of CRs or a non-specific dysfunction of cerebellar circuits. Since most of these studies used methods that could block unrelated axons passing through the IO region, additional experiments are required to further elucidate IO function, using inactivating agents that act selectively on cell bodies.","conclusion":"We found that either blocking excitatory glutamate inputs or activating inhibitory GABA inputs to the IO abolished CRs. This effect occurred with variable delay following drug injections. Additional experiments, in which post-injection testing was delayed to allow for drug diffusion, revealed invariably immediate suppression of CRs. This demonstrated that suppressing IO activity using DGG or muscimol does not induce unlearning of CRs. Single-unit recording during DGG injections revealed that CR suppression was paralleled by a dramatic suppression of IN neuronal activity. We concluded that inactivating the rostral parts of the IO complex abolishes CRs by producing a tonic malfunction of cerebellar eyeblink conditioning circuits."},{"method":"We now report that intra-cerebroventricular (ICV) anisomycin (400microg) prevents consolidation of morphine-induced place preference (CPP), but does not impair its reconsolidation unless the reactivation procedure associates anisomycin with the morphine context.

On a subsequent day rats were allowed to choose the compartment they preferred in a 20min test session. In the first experiment, rats that were injected with vehicle or with anisomycin before or 3h after training sessions, developed a CPP.

Once a CPP was established, they received four additional training sessions on which they received vehicle or anisomycin ICV.","background":"Protein synthesis inhibitors block consolidation of memory and may also block the reconsolidation of a reactivated memory in paradigms of aversive learning, but the evidence for reconsolidation effects is conflicting in appetitive paradigms.","conclusion":"All groups continued to prefer the morphine-paired compartment after reactivation sessions with vehicle or anisomycin ICV. In experiment 3, ICV anisomycin was administered selectively on morphine-paired reactivation trials or saline-paired reactivation trials and the CPP was weakened or strengthened, respectively.

However, i.t. BAM8-22 did not alter morphine-induced hyperalgesia. These results suggested that SNSR may be able to modulate the sensitivity of opioid receptor serving as a most probable underlying mechanism for the effects of BAM8-22 on morphine tolerance.

Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to map alterations in binding to brain mu-opioid receptors in separate groups.","background":"Previous studies have established a relationship between sleep disruption and pain, and it has been suggested that hyperalgesia induced by paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) could be due to a reduction of opioidergic neurotransmission in the brain.","conclusion":"Results demonstrated that PSD induced a significant reduction in thermal pain threshold, as measured by paw withdrawal latencies. This effect did not return to baseline control values after 24h of sleep recovery. The usual analgesic effect of morphine was observed in the control group but not in PSD or rebound groups except at the highest dose (10 mg\/kg). Binding of [3H]DAMGO to mu sites did not differ significantly among the three groups in any of the 33 brain regions examined. These results do not exclude the participation of the opioid system in PSD-induced pain hypersensitivity since sleep-deprived rats were clearly resistant to morphine.

Bilateral infusions of MSX-3 directly into the nucleus accumbens core (2.5 microg or 5.0 microg in 0.5 microl per side) produced a dose-related increase in locomotor activity in rats treated with 0.5 mg\/kg haloperidol either acutely or repeatedly.

These findings demonstrate that learning triggers the hypertrophy of astrocytic processes and furthermore that, unlike learning-induced synaptogenesis, astrocytic growth is reduced in the absence of continued training."},{"method":"We have therefore investigated the potential behavioural deficits induced by a NMDA-induced excitotoxic unilateral lesion of the lateral part of the striatum, by comparison with a PBS striatal injection (sham procedure), and non-operated mice behaviour. Three groups of male adult Swiss mice were constituted: unilateral NMDA (20 nmol striatal NMDA injection), sham (striatal PBS injection), and control (healthy non-operated mice). From 14 to 29 days post-surgery, sensorimotor and mnesic tests were performed in all groups. After euthanasia, immunohistochemical stainings (NeuN and GFAP) were performed in order to assess the size of the lesion.","background":"Excitotoxic lesion of the striatum provides a useful model for evaluating the excitotoxic processes involved in neurological disorders, in particular stroke diseases. The behavioural outcome after such injury is however poorly described.","conclusion":"Straight runway and passive avoidance performances revealed mild deficits related to the excitotoxic NMDA-induced lesion as compared to the sham procedure. Moreover, accelerated rotarod and Morris water maze acquisition performances also revealed deficits related to the surgery, i.e. observed in sham-operated as compared to control mice. NeuN staining revealed no striatal lesion in the sham and non-operated groups in contrast to the NMDA-injected group in which the volume of infarcted striatum was 2.4+\/-0.3mm3. GFAP staining revealed a glial reaction in the lesioned striatum of NMDA animals and at the PBS injection site in sham animals. These results suggest that NMDA-induced excitotoxic lesion induces subtle long-term behavioural deficits in mice. Moreover, this study shows the importance of the sham group to investigate the behavioural deficits after excitotoxic lesion models in mice."},{"method":"Here, we directly compared the role of vision and kinesthesis by means of a tracking task in which the left wrist mimicked the passive motions imposed on the right wrist with a torque motor. The passive movements were perceived visually (alien hand) or kinesthetically (own hand), or a combination thereof (own hand, feel and see). Tracking occurred according to the same (isodirectional) or opposite (mirror-image) directions.","background":"Coordination in biological systems requires a continuous updating of the perception-action cycle. How the different sources of sensory information contribute uniquely to performance is still debated.","conclusion":"Findings revealed that visual tracking was performed most successfully in the isodirectional and kinesthetic tracking in the mirror-image mode. Tracking was most successful when both sources of sensory information were present. These results suggest that vision and proprioception obey direction-dependent constraints that are consistent with extrinsic and intrinsic reference frames within which the perception-action cycle resides. Thus, each sensory modality contributes uniquely as a function of the spatial requirements of the tracking task, rather than one being superior over the other."},{"method":"The I\/R was induced by occluding bilateral common carotid arteries (BCCAO) for 30 min, followed by 24 h reperfusion.","background":"Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemic brain injury. Flavonoids from various herbal extracts have been shown to be neuroprotective in experimental models of cerebral ischemia\/reperfusion (I\/R). The present study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of the biflavone rich fraction from Araucaria bidwillii Hook (ABH) (Family: Araucariaceae) in I\/R induced oxidative stress.","conclusion":"BCCAO caused significant depletion in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and significant increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO) in various brain regions. The neurological deficit and sensory motor function were also decreased significantly by BCCAO group as compared to sham group animals. All the alteration induced by cerebral ischemia was significantly attenuated by 7 days' pretreatment with biflavone fraction (BFR) at the dose of 100 and 200 mg\/kg, comparable to that given by Vitamin E (200 mg\/kg). Consistent with neurobehavioral deficits, pretreatment with biflavones at higher doses significantly reduced ischemia-induced neuronal loss of the brain. In conclusion the biflavone rich fraction from A. bidwillii was found to protect rat brain against I\/R induced oxidative stress, and attributable to its antioxidant properties."},{"method":"HU 210 (12.5-200 microg\/kg), when acutely administered, antagonized the stimulant effects of morphine (7.5 mg\/kg) or alcohol (1 or 1.5 g\/kg). A tolerance to this antagonistic interaction with morphine and alcohol occurred after a 7-day or a 14-day HU 210 treatment, leading to the reappearance of morphine- and alcohol-induced stimulation. The CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant (10 mg\/kg) enhanced the stimulant effect induced by low doses of morphine (5 or 7.5 mg\/kg). Rimonabant (3 or 10 mg\/kg) altered the locomotor effect of alcohol in a biphasic manner. It enhanced the stimulant effect of low doses of alcohol (1 or 1.5 g\/kg) while decreasing the locomotor activity of mice treated with a high dose (3 g\/kg) of alcohol.","background":"Previous studies evidenced in rats the suppression by cannabinoids of motor stimulant effects of various drugs of abuse.

An increase in the characteristic speed during the first 8 days could be attributed to PV-deficiency, while the elimination of CB in CB-\/- and double-KO mice decreased the percentage of fast movements at all time points. In the latter, additionally a reduction of the fastest speed was observed.","background":"We investigated the role of the two calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin D-28k (CB) in the locomotor activity and motor coordination using null-mutant mice for PV (PV-\/-), CB (CB-\/-) or both proteins (PV-\/-CB-\/-). These proteins are expressed in distinct, mainly non-overlapping populations of neurons of the central and peripheral nervous system and PV additionally in fast-twitch muscles.","conclusion":"The alterations in locomotor activity (fast movements, fastest speed) strongly correlate with the impairment in locomotor coordination in mice deficient for CB evidenced in the runway assay and the rotarod assay. The graded locomotor phenotype (CB&gt;PV) is qualitatively correlated with alterations in Purkinje cell firing reported previously in these mice. The presence or absence of either protein did not affect the spontaneous locomotor activity when animals were placed in a novel environment and tested only once for 30 min. In summary, the lack of these calcium-binding proteins yields characteristic, yet distinct phenotypes with respect to locomotor activity and coordination."},{"method":"Besides exploratory hyperactivity in response to a novel environmental stress resembling the psychomotor agitation, OB rats showed a decrease of libido, and a deficit of long-term explicit memory, resembling loss of interest and cognitive deficits in depressive patients, respectively.

In the OB rats, we found degenerated neurons in the piriform cortex, decreased protein expression of NMDA receptor subunit 1 (NR1), but not NR2A or NR2B, in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), Hip and amygdala (Amg), and decreased phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) in the PFC and Hip, but not Amg.","background":"In order to probe the nature and validity of olfactory bulbectomized (OB) rats as a model of depression, we reevaluated their behavioural and neurochemical deficits in relation to the symptoms and neurochemical abnormalities of depression using our protocols, which distinguish anhedonia-resembling behaviour in sexual behavioural test, the hippocampus (Hip)-dependent long-term memory and anxiety-resembling behaviour specially.","conclusion":"The behavioural and neurochemical abnormalities in OB rats, except for the performance in the plus-maze task and neuronal degeneration, were significantly attenuated by repeated treatment with desipramine (10 mg\/kg), a typical antidepressant. The present study indicated that OB rats may be a model of depression with comorbid anxiety, characterized by agitation, sexual and cognitive dysfunction, neuronal degeneration, decreased protein expression of NR1, and decreased phosphorylation of CREB."},{"method":"Mchr1 knockout (KO) mice were more active than 129\/SvEv and C57BL\/6J wild-type strains in a photocell actimeter.","background":"Male mice with a null mutation of Mchr1, encoding melanin concentrating hormone receptor-1, were compared to wild-type on two background strains.","conclusion":"In addition, Mchr1 KO mice on the C57BL\/6J background were less anxious in the elevated plus-maze, while on the 129\/SvEv background, the mutants were less emotionally reactive as estimated by fecal boli and handling-related vocalization. There was no detrimental impact of the null mutation on motor coordination and spatial learning. Mchr1 KO mice had shorter latencies before reaching the escape platform, but only on the 129\/SvEv background. Null mutants were lighter than C57BL\/6J controls but heavier than 129\/SvEv controls, attributable to interactions with strain-dependent genes."},{"method":"One group of animals (Experimental Group) was presented with a bead coated with an aversive substance; a second group (Control Group 1) underwent bead presentations as in the Experimental Group but with the bead coated with water rather than with the aversive substance, and a third group (Control Group 2) did not undergo to any bead presentation. Binocular and monocular sleep was recorded during the 8h subsequent the learning (or the control) event.","background":"Monocular sleep following passive avoidance learning was investigated in young chicks.","conclusion":"The main results were that (1) the percentage of time spent in binocular sleep and the percentage of episodes of binocular sleep were lower in the Experimental Group that in the Control Groups; (2) the times spent in monocular sleep was higher in the Experimental Group and progressively lower in Control Group 1 and Control Group 2; (3) chicks slept predominantly with their left eye closed, but there was no evidence of specific changes in the opening of their right or left eyes associated with the learning event. The results seem to be compatible with the hypothesis that monocular sleep serves to provide the animal with the possibility to monitor periodically the environment to look for important events (e.g. predators, presence of the mother hen and siblings) and any arousal-producing event that would occur before a sleep episode tends to increase the likelihood of monocular sleeping."},{"method":"In this study we investigated the involvement of two major classes of glutamate receptors, NMDA and AMPA receptors, within the Nac in the acquisition of spatial information, using the Morris water maze task. Focal injections of the NMDA antagonist, AP-5 (0.1 and 0.15 microg\/side), and the AMPA antagonist, DNQX (0.005, 0.01 microg\/side), were performed before a massed training phase, and mice were tested for retention immediately after.","background":"Glutamatergic transmission within the nucleus accumbens (Nac) is considered to subserve the transfer of different types of information from the cortical and limbic regions. In particular, it has been suggested that glutamatergic afferences from the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex provide the main source of contextual information to the Nac. Accordingly, several authors have demonstrated that the blockade of glutamate receptors within the Nac impairs various spatial tasks. However, the exact role of the different classes of glutamate receptors within the Nac in short-term spatial memory is still not clear.","conclusion":"NMDA and AMPA receptor blockade induced no effect during training. On the contrary, injection of the two glutamatergic antagonists impaired spatial localization during the probe test. These data demonstrate an involvement of the Nac in short-term spatial learning.

OVX\/E mice showed the anxiolytic effect of music only in the marble burying test. Furthermore, pretreatment with progesterone's metabolite inhibitor completely prevented the anxiolytic effect of music in behavioral tests, while pretreatment with a progesterone receptor blocker did not prevent the anxiolytic effect of music.","background":"Music is known to be able to elicit emotional changes, including anxiolytic effects. The gonadal steroid hormones estradiol and progesterone have also been reported to play important roles in the modulation of anxiety. In the present study, we examined whether the effect of music on anxiety is related to ovarian steroid in female mice.","conclusion":"These results suggest that exposure to music reduces anxiety levels, and ovarian steroids, mainly progesterone, may be involved in the anxiolytic effect of music observed in female mice."},{"method":"During 5 days of baseline females were observed for their sexual and non-sexual behavior without drug. They then received daily intranasal testosterone (0.24 mg per nostril) for 7 days, followed by 15 days of intranasal testosterone application every third day or were left undisturbed (n=5 per group). Diverse sexual and non-sexual behaviors were scored. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone using immunoenzymatic chemiluminescent immunoassay.","background":"Sexual dysfunction in the female has been associated with a decrease in androgen levels, which can be reversed by testosterone treatment, however, bearing the risk of adverse side effects. Previously we found that intranasal application of testosterone led to an increase in proceptive behavior in female capuchin monkeys, which was still enhanced beyond treatment pointing to prolonged effects. Here, we sought to replicate our previous findings and to further examine possible prolonged effects of such treatment.","conclusion":"In accord with our previous results an increase in sexual proceptive behavior was revealed during testosterone treatment, which persisted about 2 weeks beyond treatment in the group receiving testosterone every third day as well as in the group that no longer received any treatment. These behavioral results were accompanied by an increase in plasma testosterone levels. This study demonstrates the efficacy of testosterone in enhancing sexual behavior in female capuchin monkeys by means of intranasal application, and provided evidence that daily substance application is not necessary to maintain beneficial effects on sexual behavior. These findings render the intranasal application procedure to be a useful alternative compared to other forms of administration."},{"method":"We report an experiment demonstrating that rats also display a Simon effect, the dynamics of which--as assessed by factorial manipulations and RT distribution analyses--partly corresponds to those of the effect studied in human participants.","background":"In humans, the Simon effect refers to the fact that choice reaction time (RT) is shorter when the stimulus corresponds spatially to the response than when it does not, albeit the location of the stimulus is irrelevant to the task. This effect has motivated innumerable empirical and theoretical studies and is considered to reflect elementary cognitive processes.","conclusion":"The present results are consistent with the ideas that in rats, like in humans, (i) the information conveyed by the stimulus is processed via two parallel routes, one controlled and relatively slow, and one fast and automatic (dual-route architecture) and (ii) the dual-route processing is finished before the start of motor processes. The correspondence between these findings and those reported in humans open new perspectives for neurophysiological investigations of the dual-route architecture in an animal model routinely studied in neuroscience research."},{"method":"Because the model has been developed and validated using Wistar rats only, the present study compared the behavioral response to signal attenuation of Lewis, Sprague Dawley and Wistar rats, and assessed the effects of the anti-compulsive drug paroxetine on compulsive behavior in Lewis and Sprague Dawley rats.","background":"In the signal attenuation rat model of obsessive-compulsive disorder, 'compulsive' behavior is induced by attenuating a signal indicating that a lever-press response was effective in producing food.

The aim of the present study was thus to test whether Lewis rats will also show increased compulsivity in the signal attenuation model.","conclusion":"The results show that Lewis rats are more 'compulsive' than Sprague Dawley and Wistar rats in terms of both higher levels of compulsive lever-pressing and higher resistance to the anti-compulsive effect of paroxetine. The possibility that these strain differences are related to strain differences in the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems are discussed in light of current knowledge of the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of OCD."},{"method":"Sexually receptive females were infused bilaterally with 200 ng of the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), or with a combination of 200 ng 8-OH-DPAT and 2000 ng of the 5-HT(2) receptor agonist, (+\/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl-2-aminopropane HCl (DOI). 8-OH-DPAT inhibited lordosis behavior and DOI reduced this inhibition. However, if females were preinfused with the PKC inhibitor, bisindolymaleimide I hydrochloride (BIM), DOI's effect was eliminated. BIM's attenuation of the effects of DOI was time-dependent. When BIM was infused 90 min, but not 30 min, before the 5-HT receptor agonists, BIM eliminated DOI's protection against the lordosis-inhibiting effects of 8-OH-DPAT. A concentration of BIM as low as 10(-5) nmol in a 0.5 microl infusion volume was effective and there was little evidence of dose responsivity between 10(-5) and 10(-1) nmol of BIM. In contrast, prior infusion with vehicle or with 10(-7) nmol BIM had no impact on the female's response to the 5-HT receptor agonists.","background":"Ovariectomized rats with bilateral cannulae near the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus were hormonally primed with 10 microg estradiol benzoate and 500 microg progesterone.","conclusion":"These findings allow the suggestion that DOI's ability to increase PKC may be responsible for attenuation of the effects of 8-OH-DPAT on lordosis behavior."},{"method":"The current studies thus assessed the role of the VLTN on trace EB conditioning in New Zealand albino rabbits. We first verified afferent connections to the mPFC (Brodmann's area 32) from the VLTN, by injecting the retrograde tracer Flourogold(c) into area 32. Strong labeling in VLTN from terminal projections to mPFC were found. We next assessed the role of VLTN in trace eyeblink conditioning in animals that received either sham or ibotenic acid VLTN lesions. EB conditioning began with 10 consecutive daily sessions of trace conditioning, followed immediately by 4 days of extinction, and then 4 days of delay conditioning.","background":"Intact cerebellar structures (i.e., deep nuclei and perhaps cortex) are essential for acquisition of both simple delay and trace eyeblink (EB) conditioning. However, successful trace conditioning also requires intact cortico-limbic structures (i.e., hippocampus, medial thalamus, and medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC). A direct connection between the cerebellum and ventrolateral thalamic nuclei (VLTN) has been demonstrated in several species. Since VLTN projects to both premotor and prefrontal cortex, it may be an essential link in a cerebellar-thalamic-prefrontal circuit that provides the CNS substrate for acquisition of the trace EB CR.","conclusion":"VLTN lesions significantly impaired acquisition of both trace and delay conditioning, and impaired extinction. These findings, thus confirm the importance of the VLTN in a postulated cerebellar-thalamic-prefrontal circuit that underlies successful trace, as well as delay EB conditioning."},{"method":"We have therefore assessed spatial learning and memory in 12-month-old APP23 using a dry-land maze test developed by Barnes.

Immediately following this phase, reversal learning was examined for 13 additional days by moving the escape tunnel to the opposite position.","background":"Spatial learning and memory deficits in the APP23 transgenic mice have mainly been studied using the Morris water maze (MWM). However learning in the MWM relies on swimming abilities and may be confounded by the stressful nature of this test.","conclusion":"During the initial learning phase, APP23 mice showed a significantly longer latency to find the escape tunnel as well as an increased number of errors compared to non-transgenic littermates. These deficits appeared to be due to a delay in switching from a \"no strategy\" to a spatial strategy. Indeed, this same delay in the use of spatial strategy was observed in the reversal phase of the study. Our results suggest that impairments in APP23 mice in learning and memory maze tests may be due to a specific deficit in the use of spatial strategy."},{"method":"We examined the effect of daily varied prenatal stress consisting of 30 min restraint, saline injections and 15 min forced swim on day 17-21 of gestation on spatial learning, synaptic plasticity and the expression of key proteins of the post synaptic density (PSD) in the hippocampus of males aged 4-5 weeks.","background":"Some but not other forms of prenatal stress have been shown to impair spatial memory in adult male offspring. It is not clear if this is because of the intensity of the stress, age of rats, or the way in which learning is assessed.","conclusion":"Prenatal stress impaired spatial learning in the Morris water maze and induced a significant decrease in long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices. There was no change in the paired pulse facilitation ratio but there was a significant reduction in the expression of the NR2B subunit of the glutamate type NMDA receptor and the GluR1 subunit of the AMPA receptor, both of which are important modulators of LTP. These changes were accompanied by a remarkable increase in the scaffolding protein PSD95, which interacts with the intracellular carboxy terminal domains of the NR2 subunits. The high levels of PSD95 may have contributed to the impairment of LTP by disrupting the clustering of NMDA receptors in CA1 synapses. The alteration by prenatal stress in the relative amounts of scaffolding proteins and those which compose glutamate receptors could explain the depression of LTP and impairment in the acquisition of spatial learning."},{"method":"Unilateral lesions were made to the dorsal hippocampus or posterior PC in contralateral hemispheres or ipsilateral hemispheres. It was hypothesized that if the hippocampus and PC interact, then contralateral lesioned animals should be markedly impaired compared to ipsilateral lesions.","background":"The goal of the present experiments was to use a disconnection paradigm to test the interactions between the hippocampus and parietal cortex (PC) during an object-place paired associate learning task, dry-land water maze task, and a reaction-to-change task. Previous research indicates that these tasks are sensitive to hippocampal or PC disruption.","conclusion":"The results indicate that contralateral lesioned animals were significantly more impaired than animals with ipsilateral lesions during object-place paired-associate learning; however, both groups readily learned single discriminations (i.e., objects or places). Furthermore, contralateral lesioned animals traveled further to find the reward during acquisition of the dry-land water maze task and spent less time in the rewarded quadrant during the probe trial. Conversely, contralateral lesioned animals' performance matched ipsilateral lesioned animals during the reaction-to-change paradigm. Thus, the hippocampus and PC interact during some tasks, presumably when tasks require multiple trials across days, but not during the detection of novelty within a single day."},{"method":"In this paper, we reported new data about ultrasonic vocalisations emitted during female-female mice social encounters.

A strong positive correlation linked the number of calls and the time spent by the resident sniffing the intruder female. Moreover, the number of calls uttered during interaction with an unknown female partner significantly decreased with pregnancy and ageing. Secondly we reported that 1-year-old female mice showed a reduction of ultrasonic calls in the presence of a partner they had been exposed to, only if the re-exposure (test) occurred 30 min after the previous presentation. If the test was performed with a delay of 60 min, the number of calls emitted did not decrease.","background":"Despite the evidence that ultrasonic vocalizations are a consistent component of the behavioural repertoire of female mice, only few studies have investigated this phenomenon.","conclusion":"These results confirm that ultrasonic vocalizations emitted during social interaction with a female conspecific can be used as an index of social recognition and can be useful to detect age-related disruption of social memory in female mice."},{"method":"To this end, the effects of central (3rd ventricular; i.c.v.) administration of GRP (0.30 nmol), GRP receptor (BB(2)) antagonist, [Leu(13)-(CH(2)NH)Leu(14)]-BN (1.26 nmol), NMB-30 (0.29 nmol), NMB (BB(1)) receptor antagonist, BIM 23127 (1.70 nmol) and a mixed BB(1)\/BB(2) receptor antagonist, PD 176252 (0.621 nmol) were assessed in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and in a fear potentiated startle paradigm (a model thought to reflect conditioned fear).","background":"Bombesin (BB)-like peptides have been implicated in the mediation and\/or modulation of the stress response.

In the fear potentiated startle paradigm, pretreatment with either the BB(1) receptor antagonist or the BB(2) receptor agonist attenuated the fear potentiated startle response, without affecting basal startle amplitude.

These results suggest that in A. burtoni social status affects the relationships between somatostatin prepropeptide and receptor gene expression in the hypothalamus and the control of somatic growth."},{"method":"The neurobiological mechanisms by which the sire becomes capable of potentiating vocalization are unknown, but are hypothesized to depend on the processes underlying development of an odor preference.","background":"Separation and reunion responses have been used to investigate social relationships in many species, including humans. When isolated from their mothers and siblings, infant rats vocalize in the ultrasonic range. An isolated pup reduces its rate of vocalization when placed in contact with familiar stimuli, particularly social ones such as its dam or littermates. The isolated pup's vocalization is greatly increased if the pup has been in contact with its mother immediately before isolation, a phenomenon called maternal potentiation. Early experience can play a role in the acquisition of potentiation. If rat pups are reared by both dam and sire, or even reared by the dam in the presence of the sire's odor, the pups show potentiation to the sire instead of the fear-related behavioral inhibition. Littermates, home cage shavings, and other familiar stimuli from the rearing environment do not elicit increased vocalizations during a subsequent isolation.","conclusion":"Expression of potentiation is hypothesized to be related to reward processes in part because dopamine activity plays a regulatory role. Activation of dopamine type 2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens blocks maternal potentiation without altering vocalization rate in an initial isolation. The modulation of isolation-induced vocalization by social interactions provides a paradigm for investigating the neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying acquisition and expression of early life social bonds."},{"method":"A total of 46 healthy women volunteered. They belonged to two age groups: young (n=34; age range 19-30 years; 12 without, and 22 with oral contraceptives (OC); early phase of the menstrual cycle) and older (n=12; age range 60-68; postmenopausal; without hormone therapy). During a 40-h total SD, the subjects performed the PVT and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) at 2-h intervals.","background":"The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of age on women's performance in the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) during total sleep deprivation (SD).","conclusion":"At baseline, the reaction speed of the young women was faster as compared to the older women (Mann-Whitney U-test p&lt;0.01). During SD, all the PVT measures as well as the SSS scores changed similarly in the two age groups, when the baseline performance difference in favour of the young women was taken into account (area under curve analyses, Mann-Whitney U-tests n.s.). No age difference in the time course of the SD-related deterioration in PVT performance or subjective sleepiness was observed. OC use had no effects on any of the measures during SD. After recovery sleep, young women had higher subjective sleepiness scores than older women, the sleepiness scores being highest in young women not taking OCs. In conclusion, in women, aging has no effects on the amount or the time course of the decline in PVT performance caused by total SD. OC use does not significantly affect young women's PVT performance during SD in the early phase of the menstrual cycle."},{"method":"The purpose of this study is to compare the ultrasonic vocalization (USV) of rats in three conditions: control, haloperidol-induced transient dopamine depletion, and unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced moderately-severe degeneration of dopamine neurons. It was hypothesized that both dopamine-altered conditions would lead to a change in the features of the USV acoustic signal.","background":"The sensorimotor speech\/voice deficits associated with Parkinson disease have been well documented in humans. They are largely resistant to pharmacological and surgical treatment, but respond to intensive speech therapy. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not well understood and are difficult to systematically test in humans. Thus, we turn to the rat as a model.","conclusion":"Results demonstrated that bandwidth decreased in the dopamine-altered rats. This is the first study to document a degradation of the acoustic signal of frequency-modulated 50-kHz calls as a result of interfering with dopamine synaptic transmission in rats. The data suggest that mild transient dopamine depletion with haloperidol or even unilateral degeneration of dopamine neurons is associated with changes in the USV acoustic signal. Dopaminergic dysfunction influences USV quality without reducing the number of calls. This study provides a foundation to examine the role of dopamine in sensorimotor processes underlying USV production and potentially to explore treatments for dopamine deficiency-related impaired vocal outcome."},{"method":"To substantiate this difference further, MOR knockout mice and wildtype littermates were tested in the Morris Water Maze (MWM), which allows for testing both components of learning. On traditional parameters for performance, no significant differences between genotypes were found.","background":"An earlier study done by Kas et al.

Eur J Neurosci 2004;20(6):1624-32] suggested that mu opioid receptor (MOR) knockout mice have deficits in the motivational component rather than in the information processing component of learning.","conclusion":"However, swimming velocity, indicative of motivation, decreased for MOR knockout mice during the course of training but not for wildtype mice. In contrast, probe trial performance was comparable between genotypes. Again, these results suggest normal information processing abilities but a decreased motivation in this MOR knockout mouse. Our conclusion is discussed in the light of other studies using MOR knockout mice that do find differences on information processing between genotypes in MWM performance."},{"method":"EEG and motor activity were recorded via telemetry in Wistar rats (n=29) for 48h under well-habituated conditions. Rats were grouped based on sleep amounts and stability across days (short [SS, n=7], intermediate [IS, n=15] and long [LS, n=7] sleep) and comparisons were conducted to determine group differences for measures of sleep and motor activity.","background":"We examined individual differences in sleep and motor activity across 2 consecutive days in rats.","conclusion":"We found that correlations across recording days were significant for all selected sleep measures and motor activity counts. Rankings for 24h total sleep time and non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) were SS&lt;IS&lt;LS rats whereas amounts of rapid eye movement sleep did not differ among groups. Further analyses of NREM episode parameters found significant differences in mean episode length (SS&lt;IS&lt;LS) but not in the number of episodes. Total and average motor activity counts (per waking min) were greater (32-38%) in SS compared to LS rats on both recording days. The results indicate that individual differences in sleep and motor activity in Wistar rats are stable across days. Differences between SS and LS rats have parallels to those reported for short and long sleep humans."},{"method":"Hooded rats of both sexes were accordingly exposed, in the dark, to Y-maze arms with either two rough (sandpaper) or two smooth floors (Perspex), or one rough and one smooth floor. One of the floors was then changed to the opposite type of surface and the rats' ability to locate and explore this changed (or novel) arm in the dark was measured.","background":"This study aimed to assess male and female rats' ability to utilize egocentric cues for detecting a change in tactile stimulation encountered in the dark (and possible sex differences). It also investigated the role of mystacial vibrissae in tactile discrimination in this particular setting.","conclusion":"Both sexes were able to complete this task successfully thereby suggesting that they had used egocentric body cues, rather than visual or olfactory cues for locating the position of the novel arm. Because rats with all their mystacial vibrissae removed were not seriously disadvantaged in locating and exploring the tactually novel arm, it appeared that their ability to discriminate between the tactile properties of the maze arms was not crucially reliant on their whiskers and allied trigeminal system, and may have also involved tactile receptors in their paws. It was concluded that rats of both sexes were able to utilize egocentric cues in detecting a tactile change, and did not rely exclusively on mystacial vibrissae for discriminating between the tactile properties of the maze-arm floors."},{"method":"Hamsters were administered AAS during adolescence, scored for offensive aggression using the resident-intruder paradigm, and then examined for changes in PAG and GluR1 immunoreactivity in areas of the brain implicated in aggression control.","background":"Male Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) treated with moderately high doses (5.0mg\/kg\/day) of anabolic\/androgenic steroids (AAS) during adolescence (P27-P56) display highly escalated offensive aggression. The current study examined whether adolescent AAS-exposure influenced the immunohistochemical localization of phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG), the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of glutamate, a fast-acting neurotransmitter implicated in the modulation of aggression in various species and models of aggression, as well as glutamate receptor 1 subunit (GluR1).","conclusion":"When compared with sesame oil-treated control animals, aggressive AAS-treated hamsters displayed a significant increase in the number of PAG- and area density of GluR1-containing neurons in several notable aggression regions, although the differential pattern of expression did not appear to overlap across brain regions. Together, these results suggest that altered glutamate synthesis and GluR1 receptor expression in specific aggression areas may be involved in adolescent AAS-induced offensive aggression."},{"method":"FGF-2 was administered either prenatally at embryonic day 15.5 (PreFGF) or, postnatally (PostFGF) for 7 consecutive days beginning 1 day following surgery. As adults, animals were tested behaviorally at spatial navigation (Morris water task), and skilled reaching (Whishaw tray reaching task).","background":"Rats with either no treatment or administration of exogenous basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) received bilateral medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) aspiration or sham lesions at postnatal day 3 (P3).","conclusion":"Early lesions of the mPFC produced a significant reduction in both brain weight and cortical thickness in adulthood. Behaviorally, mPFC lesions resulted in deficits in the water maze and reaching task. Both pre- and postnatal FGF-2 facilitated recovery in the spatial navigation task. In contrast, FGF-2 was only effective in reducing the deficits in skilled forelimb movements when the FGF was given postnatal (i.e., postsurgery). Prenatal FGF-2 increased brain weight in the lesion animals, whereas postnatal FGF-2 increased cortical thickness in the lesion animals. It thus appears that FGF-2 can facilitate recovery from perinatal cortical injury, whether it is given during the period of neurogeneration (prenatally) or after the injury, although the mechanism of action is likely different for the pre- and postnatal administration."},{"method":"The current work examined the effects of intracranial ALLO on operant ethanol self-administration in food- and water-satiated mice, with a procedure designed to estimate ALLO's influence on appetitive versus consummatory processes. Male C57BL\/6J (B6) mice were trained to press an ethanol-appropriate lever by being reinforced with 30-min of continuous access to a 10% ethanol solution. Following surgical implantation of a guide cannula aimed at the lateral ventricle and subsequent habituation to vehicle infusions, ALLO (50-400 ng; ICV) was delivered immediately prior to session start. ALLO doses of 100 and 400 ng were further evaluated for their effects on locomotor behavior within activity chambers.","background":"Although systemic allopregnanolone (ALLO; a positive modulator of GABA(A) receptors) has been shown to enhance ethanol-reinforced responding and to modulate drinking patterns in rodents, the effects of centrally administered ALLO on ethanol intake are not known.","conclusion":"ALLO selectively modulated ethanol intake patterns associated with the onset and maintenance of self-administration, while leaving appetitive (i.e., ethanol seeking) measures unaltered. The effects of ALLO on drinking patterns were dissociable from changes in locomotor behavior, as evidenced by the absence of ALLO's influence on response frequency and horizontal distance traveled. These findings support the premise that manipulations in brain ALLO levels may influence the regulatory processes governing ethanol consumption."},{"method":"The Corridor task proved to be simple and efficient to conduct with a robust ipsilateral retrieval bias in our rodent Huntington's disease model.","background":"Experimental validation of cell replacement therapy as a treatment of neurodegenerative diseases requires the demonstration of graft-mediated behavioural recovery.","conclusion":"The Corridor task is a viable behavioural option, particularly to non-specialised laboratories, for the evaluation of lateralised striatal damage and the probing of alternative therapeutic strategies, including transplantation."},{"method":"We examined the membrane phospholipid fatty acid profile in frontal cortex of rats characterized for attention, impulsiveness and motricity in various environmental contexts to determine the relationship between brain PUFA composition and the symptoms of ADHD.","background":"Inattention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness are the main symptoms of the heterogeneous attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It has been suggested that ADHD is associated with an imbalance in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition, with abnormal low levels of the main n-3 PUFA, DHA (22: 6n-3). DHA is highly accumulated in nervous tissue membranes and is implicated in neural function. Animal studies have shown that diet-induced lack of DHA in the brain leads to alterations in cognitive processes, but the relationship between DHA and hyperactivity is unclear.","conclusion":"The amounts of n-3 PUFA in the PE were significantly correlated with nocturnal locomotor activity and the locomotor response to novelty: hyperactive individuals had less n-3 PUFA than hypoactive ones. We conclude that spontaneous hyperactivity in rats is the symptom of ADHD that best predicts the n-3 PUFA content of the frontal cortex. This differential model in rats should help to better understand the role of PUFA in several psychopathologies in which PUFA composition is modified."},{"method":"In the present study, we employed a lever-press task, a behavioural paradigm which allows the study of response-reinforcement learning, discrimination of a rewarding lever (using a two-choice positional discrimination task), and the ability to increase operant behaviour when requirements for reward increase (using a progressive ratio [PR]). In parallel, locomotor activity was compared between strains to assess exploratory activity and behavioural habituation to a novel environment.","background":"Learning and memory impairments associated with diabetes have been reproduced in rodent models of diabetes type I, but few studies have been performed in spontaneously type II diabetic rodents. The study of type II diabetic rats such as the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat is of advantage when characterizing the development of cognitive impairments specifically caused by the progression of the disease and not by its treatment. We thus hypothesized that GK rats might display learning impairments when compared to non-diabetic Wistar rats.","conclusion":"Diabetic GK rats made significantly less lever-presses with increasing fixed ratios and, throughout the sessions, a trend for increased selection errors was observed in these animals. In addition, a significant reduction in the maximum number of lever-presses made by GK rats was observed during the PR sessions. Locomotor activity of GK rats was higher on the first day of exploration but significantly decreased with familiarization to the environment. The present results suggest that the diabetic-like symptomatology in GK rats led to a reduction of exploratory activity and of lever-pressing during fixed and progressive ratio schedules, likely caused by learning impairments."},{"method":"The current study examined this hypothesis and showed that a potential treatment (morphine) did not have a protective effect. In fact, morphine appeared to exacerbate the effects of nociceptive stimulation. Experiment 1 showed that after spinal cord injury 20mg\/kg of systemic morphine was necessary to induce strong antinociception and block behavioral reactivity to shock treatment, a dose that was much higher than that needed for sham controls. In Experiment 2, contused rats were given one of three doses of morphine (Vehicle, 10, 20mg\/kg) prior to exposure to uncontrollable electrical stimulation or restraint alone.","background":"Nociceptive stimulation, at an intensity that elicits pain-related behavior, attenuates recovery of locomotor and bladder functions, and increases tissue loss after a contusion injury. These data imply that nociceptive input (e.g., from tissue damage) can enhance the loss of function after injury, and that potential clinical treatments, such as pretreatment with an analgesic, may protect the damaged system from further secondary injury.","conclusion":"Despite decreasing nociceptive reactivity, morphine did not attenuate the long-term consequences of shock. Rats treated with morphine and shock had higher mortality rates, and displayed allodynic responses to innocuous sensory stimuli three weeks later. Independent of shock, morphine per se undermined recovery of sensory function. Rats treated with morphine alone also had significantly larger lesions than those treated with saline. These results suggest that nociceptive stimulation affects recovery despite a blockade of pain-elicited behavior. The results are clinically important because they suggest that opiate treatment may adversely affect the recovery of function after injury."},{"method":"The current study investigated changes in spindles, rapid eye movements, K-complexes and EEG spectral power following learning in good sleepers randomly assigned to one of four learning conditions: Pursuit Rotor (n=9), Mirror Tracing (n=9), Paired Associates (n=9), and non-learning controls (n=9).","background":"Sleep spindles and rapid eye movements have been found to increase following an intense period of learning on a combination of procedural memory tasks. It is not clear whether these changes are task specific, or the result of learning in general.","conclusion":"Following Pursuit Rotor learning, there was an increase in the duration of Stage 2 sleep, spindle density (number of spindles\/min), average spindle duration, and an increase in low frequency sigma power (12-14Hz) at occipital regions during SWS and at frontal regions during Stage 2 sleep in the second half of the night. These findings are consistent with previous findings that Pursuit Rotor learning is consolidated during Stage 2 sleep, and provide additional data to suggest that spindles across all non-REM stages may be a mechanism for brain plasticity. Following Paired Associates learning, theta power increased significantly at central regions during REM sleep. This study provides the first evidence that REM sleep theta activity is involved in declarative memory consolidation. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that brain plasticity during sleep does not involve a unitary process; that is, different types of learning have unique sleep-related memory consolidation mechanisms that act in dissociable brain regions at different times throughout the night."},{"method":"For this purpose, the effects of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine and the inhibitor of the nitric oxide synthase L-NAME on object location were assessed in the rat. In a first study, object location was impaired when the delay condition of 60-min was utilized. Subsequently, pre-training administration of scopolamine (0.2 mg\/kg but not 0.07 mg\/kg) induced delay-dependent performance deficits in this test. These impairments seem to be centrally mediated since the peripheral muscarinic receptor antagonist methylscopolamine (0.2 mg\/kg) did not affect object location under the same conditions. Finally, pre-training treatment with L-NAME (30 mg\/kg but not 10 mg\/kg) also induced delay-dependent performance deficits in the object location task.","background":"The object location task is a new procedure evaluating spatial memory abilities in the rat.

The proportion of females showing these behaviors rose to 70% by day 14 post-lesion. Ovariectomized rabbits sprayed with ZnSO(4) or animals sprayed with NaCl did not behave maternally. ZnSO(4) also provoked a transient reduction in olfactory perception: before the lesion animals from all groups directed significantly more sniffs to a flask containing male urine than to one containing water. This difference was abolished in ZnSO(4)-sprayed females (intact and ovariectomized) for 3-6 days post-lesion and was re-established by 7-9 days. NaCl did not provoke such transitory hyposmia. ZnSO(4) lesions did not provoke malaise in the animals, as determined by food intake and the frequency of scent-marking and ambulation.","background":"Maternal behavior is induced in virgin female rabbits (normally unresponsive to foster pups) by removing the accessory olfactory bulbs. To determine if the main olfactory system (MOS) plays a similar inhibitory role in the present work we investigated the effect of lesioning the olfactory epithelium with a ZnSO(4) spray on the facilitation of maternal behavior in New Zealand white virgin rabbits.","conclusion":"Results suggest that olfactory cues from the pups are aversive to virgin rabbits and that a transitory reduction in their perception (accompanied by the action of ovarian secretions) is enough to facilitate maternal responsiveness."},{"method":"These aims were investigated in two experiments.

From an age of 6 years on the results suggested that the development of olfactory function was well advanced with a significant increase found only for odor identification, but not for odor thresholds, or odor discrimination. Results from Experiment 2 indicated an increase of the P2 latency with age, although the small sample size has to be considered in the interpretation of these data.

RA, at the effective lowest dose (0.25mg\/kg), prevented Abeta(25-35)-induced nitration of proteins, an indirect indicator of ONOO(-) damage, in the hippocampus. At this dose, RA also prevented nitration of proteins and impairment of recognition memory induced by ONOO(-)-i.c.v.-injection. Co-injection of the non-memory-impairing dose of ONOO(-) with Abeta(25-35) blocked the protective effects of RA (0.25mg\/kg). These results demonstrated that the memory protective effects of RA in the neurotoxicity of Abeta(25-35) is due to its scavenging of ONOO(-), and that daily consumption of RA may protect against memory impairments observed in AD."},{"method":"A decrease in spontaneous extracellular glutamate release and increase in levels of the glutamate transporter GLAST, were observed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of PCP-treated mice, compared to saline-treated mice.

The facilitation of the function of NMDA receptors by d-cycloserine (30mg\/kg i.p.), an NMDA receptor glycine-site partial agonist, reversed the enhancement of immobility in the forced swimming test and impairment of CaMKII activation in the PCP-treated mice.

One question was whether PR circuits are specifically and preferentially tuned, prior to fear conditioning, to respond to USVs and USV-like stimuli.","conclusion":"Compared to continuous tones, the USVs were no more likely to elicit single-unit firing changes in PR. On the other hand, the continuous tones and USVs clearly did elicit different firing patterns in many units. More specifically, the USVs sometimes elicited a transient increase in discharge frequency to each call in a bout of calls. Interestingly, the USVs and the temporally matched tone segments usually elicited similar firing patterns.

The neurotransmitter findings are accompanied by depression-like symptoms (e.g. sleep alterations and reduced sucrose intake, a putative indicator of anhedonia in rodents).","background":"One of the most established hypotheses of depression focuses on alteration of the serotonergic (5-HT) function. Recent evidence suggests that serotonergic involvement in depression may be modulated by the action of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GABA). Furthermore, altered GABAergic function is also evident in depressed patients and in animal models of depression. Disturbed sleep is characteristic of patients with mood disorders. The most pronounced changes of the 5-HT firing activity occur during sleep.","conclusion":"Our results show that animals exposed to CMS had lower hippocampal GABA levels compared to controls. In addition, after CMS there was a lack of 5-HT stage-dependency. A subgroup (five out of eight animals) showed a consistent increase in 5-HT levels in slow wave sleep and REM sleep. We also observed that this increase occurred in those animals regarded as most anhedonic (lowest intake of sucrose solution). Moreover, REM sleep was positively correlated with anhedonia. No interaction between 5-HT and GABA was found in the hippocampus. The data suggest that both GABAergic and serotonergic systems may be simultaneously but independently involved in depression.

Moreover, 3 days intraperitoneal (i.p.) pretreatment with different doses of naloxone (0.5, 1 and 2mg\/kg), SCH 23390 (0.012, 0.025 and 0.05mg\/kg) or sulpiride (6.2, 12.5 and 25mg\/kg) in combination with repeated injections of morphine (5microg\/rat), blocked the opioid response on the acquisition of morphine (0.5mg\/kg) CPP. On the other hand, our results showed that 3 days single repeated administration of different doses of naloxone (0.5, 1 or 2mg\/kg, i.p.), SCH 23390 but not sulpiride followed by 5 days free of the drug, significantly decreased the acquisition of morphine (0.5mg\/kg) CPP and also induced place aversion.","background":"In the present study, the effect of repeated administration of morphine into the ventral pallidum (intra-VP) on the conditioned place preference (CPP) induced by systemic morphine injection was investigated in male Wistar rats.","conclusion":"Furthermore, the drugs' injections had no effect on locomotor activity on the testing phase of CPP. It is concluded that repeated intra-VP injections of morphine induces behavioral sensitization, which may be due to the opioidrgic and\/or dopaminergic mechanism(s)."},{"method":"In this present study, we examined gene expression changes in the PAG of social subordinate rats compared to dominant rats that do not Exhibit 22-kHz USVs.","background":"Gene expression profiles in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) of adult Long-Evans rats as a function of a stressful social defeat in inter-male fighting encounters were examined. This social subordination model mimics prototypical behavioral changes that parallel aspects of clinical depression, has been postulated to simulate early changes in the onset of depression in the losers, and has been successfully utilized for the evaluation of antidepressant activity. The 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) have been shown to reflect negative emotional states akin to anxiety and depression. Social defeat is the most robust and reliable method of eliciting these calls. The PAG has been shown to be a key brain region for the generation of 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations, and 22-kHz USVs have been shown to be controlled by the mesolimbic cholinergic system.","conclusion":"We found that social defeat significantly altered the genes associated with cholinergic synaptic transmission in the PAG. The most robust of these were the increased expression of the beta2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRNB2) and the T subunit of acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) in the subordinate animals. These changes were corroborated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and found to be exclusive to the PAG compared to seven other brain regions examined. These data suggest that cholinergic transmission in the PAG is involved in the generation of 22-kHz USVs and provide potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of affective disorders."},{"method":"Functional and effective connectivity analyses of whole brain hemodynamic activity elicited during performance of a Go\/No-Go task were used to identify functionally integrated neural networks and characterize their causal interactions.

A series of side effects as e.g. reduced motor coordination and proprioception were noticed that, however, may not have been influencing results observed in the cognition task. In conclusion, SGS742 enhanced cognitive performance in two mouse strains and we learned that testing compounds for effects on spatial memory should be carried out in several strains or even different species in order to claim cognitive enhancement."},{"method":"E1+E2 lesions produced an immediate, potent and permanent hyperphagic response that was greater than that observed in groups with individual lesions (E1 or E2) during the 22-day observation period.","background":"Individual lesions of the caudal (E1) or rostral (E2) ventral tuberomammillary nuclei induced hyperphagia in Wistar rats. The aim of the present study was to examine the additive or united effects of combined lesions of E1+E2 in food intake.","conclusion":"Furthermore, at the end of this period (Days 17\/22), the combined lesions induced a greater increase in body weight compared with groups with individual lesions. As previously reported, polydipsia is also induced by lesions of the ventral tuberomammillary subnuclei. However, in this case, responses of the individual polydipsic groups did not differ from those found in the E1+E2 ventral tuberomammillary group.

However, the matching performance of humans was affected more than that of capuchin monkeys when only a subset of stimulus parts was featured in the task. These results support the conclusion that the matching performance of capuchin monkeys is affected by the rearrangement of stimulus parts and, as such it seems to rely on global properties of the stimulus such as the spatial relationships of the component parts. However, the remarkable ability of capuchin monkeys to identify a stimulus on the basis of a subset of parts suggests that the reliance on the global properties of the stimuli may not be pervasive as it is in humans."},{"method":"In the present study, C57BL\/6J mouse pups were exposed to an anaesthetized (non-sire) adult C57BL\/6J male for 3-min\/day from postnatal days 2-14, and subsequently tested for anxiety-related behaviors (using the novel open field, elevated plus-maze, light\/dark exploration tests) and depression-related behavior (using the forced swim test) at 11 weeks of age.

Corticosterone levels were significantly lower following single exposure to the adult male than separation alone. Repeated neonatal male-exposure did not lead to significant alterations in anxiety- or depression-related behaviors in adulthood. Taken together, present data suggest that the form of adult male-exposure employed did not act as a significant stressor, at least in this mouse strain. Further studies will be needed to determine whether alternative mouse strains, exposure protocols or adult behavioral assays will produce a different pattern of short-term and long-term effects."},{"method":"GABA(B(1a))(-\/-) and GABA(B(1b))(-\/-) mice were both impaired relative to wildtype controls in a continuous spontaneous alternation behaviour test of working spatial memory.","background":"The GABA(B) receptor is a heterodimer of GABA(B(1)) and GABA(B(2)) subunits. There are two isoforms of the GABA(B(1)) subunit: GABA(B(1a)) and GABA(B(1b)). Recent studies with mutant mice suggest a differential role for the two GABA(B(1)) isoforms in behavioural processes. As pharmacological and genetic studies have implicated GABA(B) receptors in cognition we investigated the behaviour of GABA(B(1a))(-\/-) and GABA(B(1b))(-\/-) mice in different types of cognitive paradigms.","conclusion":"In contrast to the reported phenotype of GABA(B(1))(-\/-) mice, however, neither GABA(B(1a))(-\/-) nor GABA(B(1b))(-\/-) mice were deficient in a passive avoidance task. On the other hand, GABA(B(1a))(-\/-) mice were impaired in familiar and novel object recognition. We conclude that GABA(B(1)) isoforms contribute differentially to GABA(B) receptor-mediated cognitive processes."},{"method":"The current experiments investigated a possible role of the BLA in the reward of intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) of the VTA. Rats were trained in either an autotitration ICSS task or a rate-frequency ICSS task.

In spite of this frequent association, little is known about the basic neurobiology of the dual exposure in the adolescent brain.","conclusion":"During exposure (PN44-45), deficits in memory\/learning due to concomitant NIC+ETOH exposure reflected the summation of the two individual sets of effects. During a short-term drug withdrawal (PN49-50), nicotine improved memory\/learning, however, ethanol blocked nicotine-induced improvements. One month post-exposure (PN74-75), a significant female-only improvement in memory\/learning was observed as a result of co-administration. In conclusion, our results suggest that detrimental effects of nicotine and ethanol on memory\/learning during adolescent combined exposure represent a worsened outcome from the dual exposure. However, negative effects of the combined exposure fail to persist during withdrawal. In fact, the combined exposure elicits a sex-dependent late onset beneficial effect on memory\/learning during withdrawal."},{"method":"For our studies we used C57BL\/6 mice and beta2-AR knockout mice in the FVB background. Morphine dose-response relationships were established both prior to and after chronic morphine treatment. In some cases, the selective beta2-AR antagonist butoxamine was administered along with or after morphine. Physical dependence was assessed using naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. The expression of calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) were measured in spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) tissues using both real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA).","background":"Adaptations to the chronic administration of opioids reduce the utility of these drugs in treating pain and support addiction. Recent genetics-based approaches have implicated the beta2 adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) in controlling some of these responses. We do not know, however, whether this receptor can modulate tolerance, dependence or changes in gene expression caused by chronic opioid administration.","conclusion":"Both the co-administration of butoxamine with morphine and the administration of butoxamine after chronic morphine reversed morphine tolerance. Morphine failed to cause tolerance in beta2-AR knockout mice. Physical dependence was reduced under the same circumstances. The chronic administration of butoxamine with morphine reduced or eliminated the normally observed up-regulation of CGRP and SP in spinal cord and DRG tissues. Our results suggest that the beta2-AR modulates both opioid tolerance and physical dependence. Activation of beta2-ARs appears to be required for some of the key neurochemical changes which characterize chronic opioid administration. Therefore, beta2-AR antagonists show some promise as agents to enhance chronic opioid analgesic therapy."},{"method":"To study these discrepancies, we analyzed the locomotion of adult SWISS-OF1 mice over a large range of velocities using treadmill and overground track. The use of a high-speed video camera combined with cinefluoroscopic equipment allowed us to quantify in detail the various space and time parameters of limb kinematics.","background":"Many studies of interest in motor behaviour and motor impairment in mice use equally treadmill or track as a routine test. However, the literature in mammals shows a wide difference of results between the kinematics of treadmill and overground locomotion.","conclusion":"The results show that mice maintain the same gait pattern in both conditions. However, they also demonstrate that during treadmill exercise mice always exhibit higher stride frequency and consequently lower stride length. The relationship of the stance time and the swing time against the stride frequency are still the same in both conditions. We conclude that the conflict related to the discrepancy between the proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual inputs contribute to an increase in the stride frequency during the treadmill locomotion."},{"method":"An acute noise stressor, and to a greater extent a chronic, variable stressor regimen reduced ir-CRHr in BALB\/cByJ mice. In contrast, in the hardier C57BL\/6ByJ mice the acute stressor increased ir-CRHr in portions of the OFC, whereas a chronic stressor tended to reduce ir-CRHr. However, whereas the acute stressor did not influence CRH(1) mRNA expression, the chronic stressor increased CRH(1) mRNA expression in both mouse strains. The CRH(2) expression appeared in low abundance in both strains and was unaltered by the stressor.","background":"Stressors increase corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) functioning in hypothalamic and frontal cortical brain regions, and thus may contribute to the provocation of anxiety and depressive disorder. As the effects of stressors on these behavioral changes are more pronounced in some strains of mice (e.g., BALB\/cByJ) than in others (e.g., C57BL\/6ByJ), the present investigation assessed whether acute and chronic stressors would differentially influence CRH receptor immunoreactivity (ir-CRHr) and CRH receptor mRNA expression (CRH(1) and CRH(2)) in the orbital frontal cortex (OFC) of these strains.","conclusion":"In addition to the OFC variations, quantitative immunohistochemistry indicated that the chronic stressor treatment increased CRH immunoreactivity in the median eminence of C57BL\/6ByJ mice, but co-expression of CRH and arginine vasopressin (AVP) immunoreactivity was not provoked by the stressors. The data support the view that stressors provoke marked variations of ir-CRHr in the OFC that might contribute to the differential anxiety\/depression-like profiles ordinarily apparent in the stressor-vulnerable and -resilient mouse strains."},{"method":"Ovariectomized rats were treated once a week for 3 weeks with a combination of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin prior to training in a classical fear conditioning task. Training took place 1 week after the final treatment. During the training session, an auditory stimulus (a tone) was paired with a mild foot-shock.

In contrast, rats treated with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin exhibited decreased freezing during the context test session, suggestive of a specific deficit in hippocampal-related learning and memory. Together, these data indicate that administration of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin may have toxic effects on the hippocampus and results in specific learning deficits shortly after treatment has ended."},{"method":"This study evaluated the long-term effects of 10 daily morphine (10mg\/kg\/day) or saline injections on social and non-social motivated behaviors. Following 3 days or 2 weeks drug abstinence, social interest, food-seeking, and sexual pursuit were assessed.","background":"Brain opioids regulate social emotional responsivity. One neuro-evolutionary theory of addiction suggests that exogenous opiates may induce addiction via opioid-controlled emotional changes; with the drug eventually fulfilling the need for social comfort that is normally provided by endogenous opioids. This view predicts that past opiate experience may enduringly alter social responsivity. Although the acute social effects of opiates are well known, little evidence is available concerning the enduring effects of past opiate experience on social motivation aside from copulatory behaviors.","conclusion":"After 2-weeks opiate withdrawal, sexual pursuit and food-seeking behaviors were significantly increased. After a shorter 3-day withdrawal, these effects were not seen. Importantly, social interest was consistently magnified, even after short-term 3-day opiate withdrawal, and it was magnified more than sexual or food pursuit. These findings indicate that the incentive for social and non-social natural rewards were increased following withdrawal from intermittent opiate treatment, but that different morphine-induced neuroadaptations may regulate their expression."},{"method":"Here, we report the effect of different inter-phase delay intervals on the performance of G&#xf6;ttingen minipigs in the spontaneous object recognition test.

An exploration-time difference between the novel and the familiar object was interpreted as recognition of the familiar object. We scored the exploration times both manually and automatically, and compared the methods.","background":"In the neuroscience community interest for using the pig is growing. Several disease models have been developed creating a need for validation of behavioural paradigms in these animals.","conclusion":"A strong discrimination between novel and familiar objects after a 10-min inter-phase delay interval and no discrimination after 24h were found in our set-up of the spontaneous object recognition test. After a 1-h delay, the pigs still showed a significant habituation to the familiar object, but no discrimination was observed. Discrimination between the two objects was mainly confined to the first half of the test phase, and we observed a high between-subject variation. Furthermore, automatic tracking was valid for determination of habituation and discrimination parameters but lead to an overestimation of individual measurements. We conclude that the spontaneous object recognition test for pigs is sensitive to increasing inter-phase delay intervals, and that automatic data acquisition can be applied."},{"method":"The current work investigated the neural correlates of evaluation of pain depicted in words.

Social function and self-concept were assessed using questionnaires with standardized scoring filled out by subjects and one of their parents. The cortical volume and surface area of the VFC, composed of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and straight gyrus (SG), were evaluated using structural magnetic resonance imaging.","background":"Isolated clefts of the lip and\/or palate (ICLP) are developmental craniofacial abnormalities that have consistently been linked to increased social inhibition or shyness. Two explanations have been proposed: (1) psychosocial factors related to differences in facial appearance may lead to low self-concept and subsequent shyness, or (2) abnormal development of brain structures involved in social function, such as the ventral frontal cortex (VFC), may underlie the difference.","conclusion":"The ICLP subjects had significantly impaired social function relative to the comparison group. No difference in self-concept was identified. VFC morphology revealed significant differences between groups, particularly decreased volume and surface area in the left SG of the ICLP group.

In addition, gait analysis revealed an increase in the severity of the ataxia displayed by mutants over time. Interestingly, spontaneous alternation testing in a T-maze was not significantly affected in robotic mice, unlike other ataxic mutants with more rapid and extensive cerebellar degeneration; robotic therefore provides an opportunity to investigate the necessity of specific Purkinje cell populations for various behavioural tasks."},{"method":"The present study was aimed at investigating the influence of animal house temperature on the exploration of an elevated plus-maze.

There were no significant effects on the time spent in the open arms and the percentage of entries into the open arms. These effect are probably due to thermal stress and do not relate to emotional changes but rather to modifications in general activity. The frequency of stretching and head-dipping exhibited different profile reactions to temperature when compared to the above measures. These behavioral modifications are also consistent with the effects of thermal stress rather than alterations in emotionality."},{"method":"The objective of the present study was to compare the effects of prenatal challenge with different immune agents given at different time windows during gestation on behavioral outcomes in offspring.

Intramuscular injection of pregnant dams with turpentine at E15-16 also decreased PPI in adult offspring. Maternal poly I:C administration had no significant effect on PPI in offspring. In contrast to prenatal LPS exposure, acute LPS administration to naive adult males had no effect on PPI. Thus, prenatal exposure both to a systemic immunogen and to local inflammation at brief periods during later pregnancy produced lasting deficits in PPI in rat offspring.

Although this activity may reflect memory encoding, it is also possible that it is due to the process of retrieving the semantic representations of the stimuli.","conclusion":"Left hippocampal CBF was associated with faster word meaning retrieval and right hippocampal CBF with better picture naming. A follow-up experiment failed to show that faster responding in the word meaning task was associated with better episodic memory for the stimuli and so weakens the proposal that the hippocampal activity was strictly related to memory encoding.

Co-administration with melatonin prevented the development of tolerance to deltorphin I analgesia, and this effect was dose dependent.

In the present study, we examined the possible effects of quetiapine on other behavioural deficits, including the depressive and anxiolytic-like behavioural consequences of GCI.","conclusion":"GCI resulted in a decrease of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunostaining and induced depressive and anxiolytic-like behavioural changes. The behavioural changes were indicated by a significant increase in the immobility duration in a tail-suspension test, and an increase in the time spent in the light box in a light\/dark box test. Pre-administration of quetiapine significantly alleviated the decreased TH immunostaining and attenuated the depressive and anxiolytic-like behavioural changes induced by GCI. These results enhance our understanding about the mechanisms of quetiapine and suggest a wider perspective for the clinical use of quetiapine."},{"method":"We examined whether site- and subtype-selective blockade of DORs within the rat mesocorticolimbic system affects cocaine self-administration. The DOR antagonist naltrindole 5'-isothiocyanate (5'-NTII; 5nmol) was microinjected into the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), ventral tegmental area (VTA), or amygdala (AMYG) in rats self-administering 1.5mg\/kg cocaine under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule.","background":"Whether the delta-opioid receptor (DOR) system can modulate behavioral effects of cocaine remains equivocal.","conclusion":"Intra-NAcc 5'-NTII significantly decreased cocaine self-administration, while 5'-NTII administration into the VTA significantly increased cocaine-maintained responding. 5'-NTII administration into the AMYG produced no effect. These data support a site-specific role of DORs in cocaine's behavioral effects."},{"method":"Here we investigated the effects of a clinically-comparable treatment regime of IFN-alpha on depressive- and anxiety-like behaviour in rats; and also examined frontal-cortical and hippocampal BDNF levels. Rats treated with IFN-alpha for four weeks showed significant increases in depressive- and anxiety-like behaviour. Further experimental investigation revealed that hedonic dysregulation (stronger preference for a sweet solution) did not emerge until the second week of treatment, and became more persistent as treatment progressed.","background":"Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) is a naturally occurring human cytokine that is a key therapy in the treatment of several viral diseases and cancers. However, treatment can produce significant neuropsychiatric and neurotoxic adverse events, including depression and anxiety.","conclusion":"No significant IFN-alpha-induced changes in BDNF levels were found. These results indicate that the affective deficits seen in patients may be modelled in healthy animals. This model may represent a novel tool to investigate the extent of and mechanisms underlying the IFN-alpha psychiatric syndrome."},{"method":"The effects of intraperitoneal administered oleamide on Novelty-induced behaviours, learning and memory and forced swimming-induced depression were studied. The relative effects of the compound on the male and female mice were also noted.","background":"Oleamide, a fatty acid amide accumulates selectively in the cerebrospinal fluid of sleep deprived cats and rats. Oleamide has been reported to have effects on a wide range of receptors and neurotransmitter systems especially the centrally acting ones for example, dopamine acetylcholine, serotonin, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), cannabinoid and vanilloid among others. This suggests a wide range of central nervous system effects of the compound.","conclusion":"Oleamide dose-dependently reduced (p&lt;0.05) novelty induced rearing, grooming and locomotion. The effects on the all NIBs started within the first 10 min of the test and the peak of the effects was observed during the third 10 min period of the test. Effect of oleamide on short-term working memory was significantly (p&lt;0.05) affected only with the dose of 5mg\/kg while the other dose of 10mg\/kg had no effect. In the forced swimming test, acute triple intraperitoneal administration of oleamide at 10mg\/kg induced a significant reduction in the immobility duration in mice signifying an antidepressant effect. Sex differences in the effects of oleamide (10mg\/kg, i.p.) were clearly evident in active behaviours in FST. These results confirm the multiplicity of central nervous system receptors and neurotransmitters that oleamide interacts with hence its numerous and diverse neuropharmacological effects. Most importantly, the present study suggests that oleamide has antidepressant-like property."},{"method":"In Experiment 1, when compared scent marking toward adult males, C57 males showed substantial scent marking toward CD-1 males and even toward the odor alone of CD-1 males, but not toward C57 males. Experiment 2 explored scent marking in C57 males of different ages to males and females, and juveniles and adults of the same strain. C57 males deposited more marks than control conditions only toward an adult C57 female when tested at 100 days of age, but not at 60 days of age. Development of urine marking behavior was investigated in C57 males at the ages of 30, 60, 90, and 120 days in Experiment 3. When tested alone (control) or confronted with a C57 male, C57 males showed diminished scent marks throughout development.","background":"The present study investigated urinary scent marking behavior in male C57BL\/6J (C57) mice as olfactory social signaling.","conclusion":"Compared to controls, marking toward a CD-1 male increased after the age of 60 days, while marks toward an adult female showed significant increases after the age of 90 days. This difference in scent marking depending on the sex of the stimulus animal is likely to be associated with development of sexual behavior, in which males need to set up territories against other males prior to advertising to females. Although highly inbred strains have similar odor components, C57 males are able to detect and deposit urine marks after puberty as social communication depending on age, sex, and genetic differences in the opponents."},{"method":"This delay was reversed by crushing the connective between serotonin-exposed and serotonin-naive ganglia, and correlated with an increase in spontaneous impulse activity in this connective.","background":"Serotonin, acting through a cAMP-signaling pathway, delayed habituation to criterion of the leech's swim response to touch.","conclusion":"We suggest that increased activity in intersegmental interneurons may play a role in maintaining swim responsiveness when concentrations of serotonin are elevated."},{"method":"We observed that mice undergoing three times of methamphetamine and compartment pairings exhibited similar compartment preference as those with only one or two methamphetamine-compartment pairings even though they all experienced three vehicle-compartment pairings. Moreover, 30 min before the CPP test, single methamphetamine injection at a dose of 1mg\/kg abolished methamphetamine (1mg\/kg)-induced CPP, while one dose of cocaine (5mg\/kg) did not affect cocaine (5mg\/kg)-induced CPP under a similar protocol. Finally, pretreatment with 1mg\/kg of methamphetamine impaired the spontaneous alteration and recognition performance in Y maze task and impeded the object recognition performance.","background":"Drug memory plays an important role in priming subsequent drug use. We used drug-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) as a paradigm to study such drug memory. In this paradigm, repeated association of specific environmental cues with abused drug-induced subjective euphoria has been suggested to motivate later biased approaching behavior toward the euphoria-linked environment at a drug-free status. Our previous report indicated that formation of methamphetamine-induced CPP was independent of de novo protein synthesis. We suspected that methamphetamine-produced effects independent of its hedonic value may be responsible for the drug-induced place preference. One such possibility was that methamphetamine treatment directly disrupted the sensory encoding process and rodents' novelty-seeking propensity consequently determined the biased place performance.","conclusion":"Taken together, we conclude that methamphetamine-induced CPP performance may be, in part, caused by methamphetamine-impaired sensory processing."},{"method":"We examined whether sex differences exist in pre-pubertal children completing a Virtual Morris Water Task, which has previously shown strong sex differences in adults.","background":"Gonadal steroid effects during puberty are often hypothesized to account for the male advantage seen in certain spatial tasks. One spatial task where males consistently show better performance than females is the Morris Water Task in which subjects must navigate to a goal location in a pool.","conclusion":"Pre-pubertal boys show superior performance to similar-aged girls, as evidenced by shorter latencies to find the platform and stronger preferences for the platform location during a probe trial. These results suggest that sex differences in spatial learning and memory exist prior to puberty and do not appear to require the effects of sex hormones at puberty. Rather, these differences may reflect early-life hormonal effects on hippocampal-dependent processes and may suggest different preferential learning strategies by boys and girls."},{"method":"The behavioral measurement was then applied to assess functional outcome with the combination antibody treatment in the orthotopic mouse model of human U87 glioma.","background":"The objective of the current study was to investigate the behavioral changes of glioma-bearing nude mice and functional outcome from treatment with a novel antiangiogenesis regimen, which is a combination of monoclonal antibodies against both vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1 (MF1) and VEGFR-2 (DC101). The reliability and responsiveness of behavioral measurement with the rearing test were first examined in nude mice bearing two kinds of gliomas--9L gliosarcoma and U87 human glioma, which have different growth rates. Using immunohistochemical staining and fluorescent imaging techniques, upregulation of the angiogenesis marker VEGF, coincident with the abnormal neovascular architecture, was confirmed in the human U87 glioma model.","conclusion":"The combination antibody therapy retarded tumor progression and delayed the onset of significant behavioral deficits. Histologically, tumor necrosis and apoptosis were increased and tumor cell proliferation was decreased after treatment. In clinical trials for novel interventions, functional end points typically are included in the assessment of potential efficacy. Because certain interventions that successfully treat tumor progression in animal models might interfere with compensatory neuroplasticity, functional measurement may be valuable for improving the clinical relevance of translational brain tumor research."},{"method":"For this purpose, stimuli were presented on a touch screen monitor. Ten adult subjects (five females and five males) were used. Before the tests, they were trained to discriminate between two physically different lines with and without arrowheads. The longer lines were always the positive (rewarded) stimuli. Regarding the M&#xfc;ller-Lyer Illusion test, all monkeys, unrespective of gender, demonstrated susceptibility to the illusion, by choosing preferentially the line with inward-pointing arrowheads. In order to determine the degree of the illusion, a point of subjective equality test (PSE) was performed.","background":"Visual illusions are formed by differences between the perception of one figure and its real physical characteristics. The M&#xfc;ller-Lyer illusion is the best known and most studied geometric illusion, consisting in the subject's judgment between two parallel lines that have the same size, one flanked with outward-pointing arrowheads, and the other with inward-pointing arrowheads. These arrowheads act as inductors that make the lines to be perceived as having different sizes, inward-pointing stimuli being estimated as longer. This study aimed to investigate the M&#xfc;ller-Lyer illusion in capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella), a New World primate not yet investigated for this illusion.","conclusion":"The PSE without arrowheads values were lower than the PSE with arrowheads. Thus, it was demonstrated that capuchin monkeys were susceptible to the M&#xfc;ller-Lyer illusion, once the perception of the lines' size was influenced by the presence of the arrowheads and by their orientation."},{"method":"In order to further examine the organization of exploratory behavior, the present study examined the influence of the point of entry on animals placed on an open field table that was illuminated either by room light or infrared light (a wavelength in which they cannot see) and near which, or on which, distinctive cues were placed.","background":"The exploratory behavior of rats on an open field is organized in that animals spend disproportionate amounts of time at certain locations, termed home bases, which serve as centers for excursions. Although home bases are preferentially formed near distinctive cues, including visual cues, animals also visit and pause and move slowly, or linger, at many other locations in a test environment.","conclusion":"The main findings were that in both room light and infrared light tests, rats visited and lingered at the point of entry significantly more often than comparative control locations. Although the rats also visited and lingered in the vicinity of salient visual cues, the point of entry still remained a focus of visits. Finally, the preference for the point of entry increased as a function of salience of the cues marking that location. That the point of entry influences the organization of exploratory behavior is discussed in relation to the idea that the exploratory behavior of the rat is directed toward optimizing security as well as forming a spatial representation of the environment."},{"method":"Borderline hypertensive rats (BHR), which are the first generation offspring of spontaneously hyperternsive and Wistar-Kyoto rats, were separated from the dams for 3h per day from postnatal day 1 through 14. Non-separated controls remained in the home cage. When allowed to explore the open field chamber for 60 min as adults, MS subjects had significantly greater locomotor activity compared to controls. All subjects were exposed to 30 min of restraint stress during which time mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were measured.","background":"There is much evidence suggesting early life events, such has handling or repeated separations from the nest, can have a long-term effect on the biological and behavioral development of rats. The current study examined the effect of repeated maternal separation (MS) on the behavioral, cardiovascular, and neurobiological responses to stress in subjects vulnerable to environmental stressors as adults.","conclusion":"Although both groups had comparable increases in MAP, MS animals displayed significantly higher HR throughout the stress period. Finally, MS subjects had significantly more stress-induced Fos positive cells, an estimate of neuronal activation, in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), each of which plays an important role in organizing the biobehavioral response to stress. These results suggest that maternal separation can further enhance stress reactivity in this model and may represent a useful approach for studying the relationship between early life events and future vulnerability to stressful situations."},{"method":"Here, thermal pain thresholds were obtained from rats with a genetic predisposition to high anxiety-related behaviour (HAB), including signs of comorbid depression-like behaviour and from controls (low-anxiety rats (LAB); cross-bred HAB and LAB rats; Wistar rats). Furthermore, the effect of eight-week antidepressive treatment using citalopram and of short-term anxiolytic treatment with diazepam on pain-related behaviour was assessed. Simultaneously, anxiety-related behaviour was monitored.","background":"Complex interactions between pain perception, anxiety and depressive symptoms have repeatedly been described. However, pathophysiological or biochemical mechanisms underlying the alterations of pain perception in patients suffering from anxiety or depression still remain a matter of debate. Thus, we aimed to perform an investigation on pain perception in an animal model of extremes in anxiety-related behaviour, which might provide a tool for future studies.","conclusion":"At baseline, HAB animals showed 35% higher thresholds for thermal pain than controls. These were normalized to control levels after eight weeks of continuous citalopram treatment paralleled by a reduction of anxiety-related behaviour, but also acutely after diazepam administration. Overall, thermal pain thresholds in HAB animals are shifted in a similar fashion as seen in patients suffering from major depressive disorder. Antidepressive, as well as anxiolytic treatments, attenuated these differences. As the relative importance of the factors anxiety and depression cannot be derived from this study with certainty, extending these investigations to additional animal models might represent a valuable tool for future investigations concerning the interrelations between anxiety, depression, and pain at a molecular level."},{"method":"After inducing in rats a preference for a distinctive compartment paired with morphine, the memory for drug experience was reactivated by a 20-min test session and saline, the beta-antagonist propranolol, or the peripherally acting beta-antagonist nadolol were administered. Animals which received saline or nadolol upon reactivation, or propanolol without memory reactivation, maintained their preference for the drug-paired compartment 24h and seven days later.","background":"Blocking the process of memory reconsolidation by means of amnestic agents may prove to have therapeutic applications. Here we used a morphine-induced conditioned place preference as an index of drug seeking.","conclusion":"However, animals that received propranolol upon reactivation no longer displayed a morphine preference on either test, although these animals once again expressed a preference when given a morphine-primed retest at 10 days. Our results suggest that beta-blockers may have potential for attenuating the impact of cue-induced craving which is a major cause of relapse in detoxified addicts."},{"method":"The present study evaluated the effect of increased age on recovery of function following bilateral medial frontal cortex injury. Groups of young (3 months) and middle-aged (14 months) rats received bilateral frontal cortex contusions or sham injuries. The rats were tested on a variety of tests to measure sensorimotor performance (bilateral tactile adhesive removal test), skilled forelimb use (staircase test), and the acquisition of reference and working memory in the Morris water maze.","background":"With increasing age comes an increased risk for sustaining traumatic brain injuries (TBI). However, the effect of age is rarely studied in animal models of TBI.","conclusion":"Results indicated that injury produced significant impairments on all behavioral tests compared to sham controls. Middle-aged rats that received cortical contusions were significantly impaired on the bilateral tactile adhesive removal test, acquisition of a reference memory task, and working memory compared to young-injured rats. Histological analysis showed that middle-aged rats developed significantly larger lesion cavities but did not show an increase in the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP+) cells compared to young-injured rats. Age alone also significantly impaired function on the bilateral adhesive tactile removal test, skilled forelimb use, the acquisition of a reference memory task, and also increased the number of GFAP+ cells compared to young rats. These results indicate that middle-aged rats respond to brain injury differently than young rats and that age is an important factor to consider in pre-clinical efficacy studies."},{"method":"The first set of experiments demonstrated that intramuscular injections of cocaine and amphetamine have robust and distinguishable effects on crayfish behavior. In the second part of the study, the reinforcing properties of psychostimulants were tested in a series of conditioned place preference experiments. Amphetamine and, to a lesser extent, cocaine were both found to serve as rewards when their intra-circulatory infusion was coupled to a distinct visual environment.","background":"Recent investigations in invertebrate neurobiology have opened up a new line of research into the basic behavioral, neurochemical and genomic alterations that accompany psychostimulant drug exposure. However, the extent to which such findings relate to changes in motivational and learning processes, such as those that typify drug addictions, remains unclear. The present study addressed this issue in the crayfish, Orconectes rusticus.","conclusion":"The monoaminergic regulation of behavior has been extensively studied in decapod crustaceans and the present experiments demonstrated that (mammalian) drugs of abuse, capable of interfering with monoamine chemistry, are similarly rewarding to crayfish. Behavioral studies in crayfish can provide a complementary approach to using other invertebrate species in addiction research."},{"method":"Therefore, in the present study we examined the emotional reactivity in stressed (chronic restraint stress applied 3 x 45 min per day during the last week of pregnancy) and unstressed females rats after the weaning of their pups.","background":"Human and animal studies indicate that repeated stress during pregnancy can produce long-term biological and behavioural disorders in the offspring. In contrast, although maternal stress is supposed to induce an increase of maternal anxiety, few studies have been conducted to demonstrate it.","conclusion":"Restraint stress procedure reduced the body weight gain both during pregnancy and up to four weeks after the stress period. Stressed dams presented a reduction of exploration and of corticosterone levels when exposed to a novel environment (25 and 49 days post-stress). They spent less time in the open arms of the elevated plus-maze (26 days post-stress). Finally, they showed no increase in the time spent in immobility after a second exposure to the forced-swim test (35-36 days post-stress). In the contrary, such differences were not observed when the chronic stress procedure was applied on virgin females. Overall, our results show that, chronic stress during gestation induces lasting effects on emotional reactivity of the dams, thus indicating that gestation constitutes a critical period in the vulnerability to stressful events also for the mother."},{"method":"In the recognition memory task, rats were permitted to freely explore two arms in the maze on a first trial and one 'familiar' arm and one novelly located arm on a second trial 105 min later.

Lidocaine inactivation of the mPFC prior to the final trial in each task disrupted performance on the temporal order but not the recognition memory task, thereby demonstrating a role for the mPFC in the retrieval and\/or use of temporal order information but not in spatial memory per se. These findings highlight the specific involvement of the rat mPFC in temporal order memory and have important implications for a broader understanding of mPFC function."},{"method":"Rats were given intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of a water soluble form of forskolin (7DMB-forskolin) or vehicle 10 min prior to intraperitoneal (i.p.) cocaine or saline administration on 7 consecutive days. Acute or chronic forskolin alone had no effect on locomotor activity at the doses tested. On days 1 and 2, the activity of rats that received i.c.v. forskolin paired with cocaine was not significantly different from rats that received i.c.v. injections of vehicle co-administered with cocaine.","background":"Repeated cocaine exposure produces behavioral sensitization expressed as an increased locomotor response to subsequent drug administration. Chronic cocaine administration also results in increased activity of adenylyl cyclase and cyclic-AMP (cAMP) dependent protein kinase (PKA) in the nucleus accumbens. To investigate the relationship between cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization and cAMP signaling, the present study examined the effect of forskolin, a direct adenylyl cyclase activator, on cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion and behavioral sensitization to cocaine.","conclusion":"By the third day of forskolin\/cocaine co-administration, rats displayed enhanced cocaine-induced hyperlocomotor activity compared to rats that received cocaine alone, an effect that persisted through day 7. When challenged with cocaine on day 14, animals that had previously received forskolin paired with cocaine on days 1-7 displayed similar locomotor activity to animals that received cocaine only. These results suggest that alterations in adenylyl cyclase activity and\/or cAMP levels may underlie the hyperlocomotor response to cocaine and may play a role in behavioral sensitization."},{"method":"Using a neuro-ethological approach, we investigate if high level of background noise added to conspecific song can modify this song-induced genic activation. We test the ZENK activation in the NCM of adult male Zebra finches Taeniopygya guttata (n = 17) by playing back conspecific signals mixed with different levels of noise, the successful discrimination being reflected by the birds' (n = 6) behavioural responses to these stimuli.","background":"Specialised brain structures allow songbirds to process acoustic signals. One of these brain areas, the NCM (caudomedial neostriatum), shows an immediate-early gene ZENK response when a bird hears a conspecific song.","conclusion":"From our results, it appears that a high genic activation of the NCM does not necessarily require the audition of an undegraded species-specific signal. Nevertheless, it requires that the signal still contains sufficient information to elicit a behavioural response. The genic activation of the NCM remains thus stable against very high levels of a wide-band background noise, as far as the signal recognition remains possible for the bird."},{"method":"The protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin was injected systemically immediately after spatial reversal sessions, which consisted of eight, two, or one reversal trials.","background":"Four experiments with C57BL\/6 mice examined the effects of protein synthesis inhibition on extinction of spatial preferences in the Morris water maze.","conclusion":"Anisomycin had no effect on extinction of a spatial preference with eight reversal trials per session. When only two reversal trials were administered per session, anisomycin slowed extinction initially, although full extinction occurred with further training even in the presence of anisomycin. In both cases, anisomycin blocked acquisition of the reversal preference. When anisomycin injections followed a single simple extinction trial, performance was not disrupted. These findings suggest that acquisition and extinction may involve different molecular processes, and they do not support the idea that brief extinction trials induce a protein synthesis-dependent reconsolidation phase of spatial memory."},{"method":"In this study, we examined whether NO-dependent pathways of the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG) participate in the anxiolytic effect of ethanol in rats submitted to the elevated plus-maze test. We evaluated the impact on ethanol effects of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor 7-nitroindazole, the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1H-(1,2,4)-oxodiazolo (4,3-a) quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), the cyclic guanylate monophosphate (cGMP) analogue 8-bromo-cGMP and the NO donor sodium nitroprusside.","background":"Our previous study showed the microinjection of drugs that influence the nitric oxide (NO)-mediated neurotransmission in the hippocampus impacts upon the anxiolytic-like effect of ethanol.","conclusion":"The results showed that ODQ and 7-nitroindazole increased the percentage of open arm entries and of time spent on open arms in the elevated plus maze in rats injected with ethanol at 1.0g\/kg, a dose that did not produce anxiolysis per se. Conversely, 8-bromo-cGMP and sodium nitroprusside blocked the increased exploration of open arms exhibited by rats treated with a higher dose of ethanol (1.2g\/kg). Taken together, the results suggest that the inhibition of NO-dependent pathways of the dlPAG enhances the anxiolytic effect of ethanol, whereas the activation of these pathways results in an opposite effect."},{"method":"The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of bilateral lesions of the gustatory cortex-focusing on electrolytic and excitotoxic lesions. Lesioned and sham-operated male Long-Evans rats were intoxicated using LiCl after drinking sucrose from a tube (SD) or having the same amount of sucrose fed directly into their mouths through a chronically implanted intra-oral (IO) cannula. Every aspect of the experiment was carefully counterbalanced between the experimental groups.","background":"The insular gustatory cortex may be essential for the evaluation of saliency and representation of the incentive values of tastes. Gustatory cortex lesions should interfere with conditioned taste avoidance according to these factors, which depend on the conditioned taste avoidance protocol used.","conclusion":"In the control groups, the acquired avoidance towards sucrose was strongly preserved over eight extinction test days in SD rats but not in IO rats, in which a progressive decline was recorded. Electrolytic gustatory cortex lesions impaired but did not suppress conditioned taste avoidance in both protocols. Excitotoxic lesions tend to impair CTA also, but differentially according to the SD or IO protocols. Extinction of CTA was selectively impaired in the SD protocol by small lesions destroying the anterior insular cortex."},{"method":"In the present study, we investigated the effect of chronic hyperhomocysteinemia on rat performance in the Morris water maze task. Chronic treatment was administered from the 6th to the 28th day of life by s.c. injection of homocysteine, twice a day at 8-h intervals; control rats received the same volume of saline solution. Animals were left to recover until the 60th day of life. Morris water maze tasks were then performed, in order to verify any effect of early homocysteine administration on reference and working memory of rats.","background":"Homocystinuria is an inherited metabolic disease biochemically characterized by tissue accumulation of homocysteine. Affected patients present mental retardation and other neurological symptoms whose mechanisms are still obscure.","conclusion":"Results showed that chronic treatment with homocysteine impaired memory of the platform location and that homocysteine treated animals presented fewer crossings to the place where the platform was located in training trials when compared to saline-treated animals (controls). In the working memory task, homocysteine treated animals also needed more time to find the platform. Our findings suggest that chronic experimental hyperhomocysteinemia causes cognitive dysfunction and that might be related to the neurological complications characteristic of homocystinuric patients."},{"method":"In the present study, we investigated the role of BLA dopamine (DA) in the habituation of the acoustic startle response (ASR) with intra-BLA infusions of DA receptor antagonists. Male Long Evans rats were subjected to startle pulses over two consecutive once-daily sessions. Prior to testing on Day 1, separate groups of animals received bilateral intra-BLA infusions of a D1 (SCH 23390: 0, 3.2, 6.4 microg per side) or a D2\/D3 (raclopride: 0, 2.5, 5.0 microg per side) receptor antagonist. Animals were retested 24h later (Day 2) without prior drug infusion in order to assess possible treatment effects on within- and between-session habituation of the ASR.","background":"Although the basolateral amygdala (BLA) plays a role in the habituation to sensory stimuli, the receptor mechanisms mediating this process remain unclear.","conclusion":"As expected, within- and between-session habituation was observed in vehicle-treated controls. Within-session habituation was also seen in SCH 23390- and raclopride-treated animals both on Day 1 as well as 24h later (Day 2). Evidence of between-session habituation was observed in SCH 23390-treated animals. However, compared to vehicle, intra-BLA SCH 23390 or raclopride attenuated the initial startle response on Day 1, but not Day 2. No evidence of between-session habituation was found in raclopride-treated animals, although this probably reflected the attenuated initial response to the startling stimulus on Day 1 rather than a reduced rate of habituation on Day 2. The present study suggests that while BLA DA is not involved in habituation of the ASR, it may mediate the perceived aversive nature of the initially startling stimuli."},{"method":"The effect of the alpha2-agonists clonidine and guanabenz on memory processes, in dependence to the time of administration, was evaluated in the mouse passive avoidance test. Clonidine (0.02-0.2 mg kg(-1) i.p.) and guanabenz (0.1-0.3 mg kg(-1) i.p.) induced amnesia in a dose-dependent manner. From time-course experiments emerged that the impairment of memory function was detectable only when clonidine and guanabenz were administered 60 min before or immediately after the training test, respectively. This detrimental effect was prevented by pretreatment with the alpha2-antagonist yohimbine (1-3 mg kg(-1) i.p.) and by the alpha2A-antagonist BRL-44408 (0.3-1 mg kg(-1) i.p.). By contrast, the alpha(2B,C) antagonists ARC-239 (10 mg kg(-1) i.p.) and prazosin (1 mg kg(-1) i.p.) did not revert the amnesia induced by both clonidine and guanabenz. At the highest effective doses, clonidine and guanabenz were devoid of behavioral side-effects as well as maintained unaltered the motor coordination, as revealed by the rota-rod test. Furthermore, none of the compounds used modified the spontaneous motility as indicated by the Animex apparatus.","background":"The activation of alpha2-adrenoceptors has been reported to impair memory functions in both rats and humans. The alpha2-adrenoceptor subtype responsible for this detrimental effect is still unknown.","conclusion":"These results indicate that clonidine and guanabenz impaired memory processes in a mouse passive avoidance paradigm through the selective activation of the alpha2A-adrenoceptor subtype."},{"method":"The first test used a Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) paradigm, assessing the capacity of the CS to enhance instrumental responding for food.

Although there was a significant correlation between tests in the magnitude of the CS-induced increase of food-magazine entries, the main dependent measure from PIT (number of lever presses) and that from the Pavlovian test (total number of behavioural elements) did not correlate. It is suggested that in the PIT procedure, the CS induces a chain of behavioural responses of which lever pressing is just a single element and that the Pavlovian test, in principle, is more sensitive."},{"method":"In the present study we investigated the cognitive function in transgenic mice not expressing IL-6 (IL-6 KO) and in wild type (WT) genotype at 4 and 12 months of age, using a passive avoidance and an eight-arm radial maze tasks.

Hippocampal choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity was evaluated in both genotypes.","background":"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine shown to affect brain function and to be involved in pathological neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).","conclusion":"No difference was observed in both genotypes for spontaneous motor activity. The mean latency (s) to re-enter the shock box, was similar in both young mutant and WT mice. However, a decreased sensitivity (50%) to scopolamine (1 mg\/kg) in mutant compared to WT mice, was obtained. IL-6 KO mice exhibited a facilitation of radial maze learning over 30 days, in terms of a lower number of working memory errors and a higher percentage of animals reaching the criterion as compared with WT genotype tested at both ages. Furthermore, mutant mice, at the age of 12 months, showed a faster acquisition (22 days versus 30 days to reach the criterion). The pattern of arm entry exhibited by IL-6 KO mice showed a robust tendency to enter an adjacent arm at both ages, while WT only at the age of 4 months. ChAT activity was inversely correlated with memory performance. These findings suggest a possible involvement of IL-6 on memory processes, even if the mechanism remains still unclear."},{"method":"Using immunohistochemical double labeling for c-fos activation and serotonin, we examined the effects of delivering 100 inescapable tailshocks to rats on serotonergic neuronal activation throughout the brainstem raphe system.","background":"Animal studies examining the effects of stress upon brain serotonergic neurons have not presented a clearcut and consistent picture. One stressor that has been shown to exert a consistently strong effect on serotonin release and c-fos activation in the dorsal raphe nucleus of rats is a series of inescapable electrical shocks.","conclusion":"This stimulus exerted a consistent and strong activation of the entire midline brain stem system of serotonergic neurons. The implications of these findings for animal models of human psychopathology are discussed."},{"method":"To answer this question, rats were treated with rotenone 2.5 mg\/kg over 48 days. Behavioural data showed a strong increase in catalepsy, a decrease in locomotor activity and biochemical data showed a significant depletion of dopamine levels in the striatum (Cpu) and substantia nigra in rotenone treated animals compared to vehicle. To examine the effectiveness of L-DOPA in reversing the motor deficit in rats, a dose of L-DOPA (10 mg\/kg) in combination with the peripheral amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor benserazide were daily administrated intraperitonially for a period of 10 days in the rotenone-treated rats.","background":"Peripherally and locally administered rotenone (an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I) has been proposed as a model of Parkinson's disease (PD) as it induces nigrostriatal degeneration associated with alpha-synuclein inclusions. If rotenone-induced symptoms represent a model of PD, than they should be counteracted by L-DOPA.","conclusion":"This treatment counteracted catalepsy and increased locomotor activity and number of rearings but decreased inactive sitting. In this animal model (rotenone model), catalepsy tests and motor activities showed that the clinically used anti-parkinsonian drug L-DOPA substitutes rotenone-induced dopamine (DA) deficiency."},{"method":"Time spent in sleeping with both eyes closed (binocular sleep) decreased gradually with age in both I-chicks and in NI-chicks whilst the number of episodes of binocular sleep decreased with age in NI-chicks but not in I-chicks. The pattern of monocular sleep (only one eye closed) of both I-chicks and NI-chicks showed no significant bias towards predominant left- or right-eye closure during the first week. During the second week, I-chicks showed a tendency towards more pronounced left-eye closure with a peak on day 10, whilst NI-chicks showed a tendency for more pronounced right-eye closure with peaks on days 9 and 11. In a different group of chicks, changing the colour of the imprinting object on day 8 produced a shift towards right-eye closure. In contrast, the removal of the imprinting object on day 8 did not cause any change in the pattern of monocular sleep.","background":"Behavioural sleep during the first 2 weeks after hatching was studied in male chicks reared with an imprinting object (I-chicks) and in social isolation (NI-chicks).","conclusion":"Differences with respect to sleeping patterns previously observed in females chicks are discussed."},{"method":"We found such cells in anterior parietal areas. They reacted with short-latency activity changes to an auditory signal (a click) that prompted those movements.","background":"Neurons in the monkey's anterior parietal cortex (Brodmann's areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 2) have been reported to retain information from a visual cue that has been associated with a tactile stimulus in a haptic memory task. This cross-modal transfer indicates that neurons in somatosensory cortex can respond to non-tactile stimuli if they are associated with tactile information needed for performance of the task. We hypothesized that neurons in somatosensory cortex would be activated by other non-tactile stimuli signaling the haptic movements--of arm and hand--that the task required.","conclusion":"Further, some of those cells changed their discharge in temporal correlation with the movements themselves, with the touch of the test objects, and with the short-term memory of those objects for subsequent tactile discrimination. These findings suggest that cells in the somatosensory cortex participate in the behavioral integration of auditory stimuli with other sensory stimuli and with motor acts that are associated with those stimuli."},{"method":"To examine the effect of the PICs on leverpress escape\/avoidance conditioning, we injected male Sprague-Dawley rats with IL-1beta, IL-6 (both 3.0 microg\/kg, i.p.), TNFalpha (6.0 microg\/kg, i.p.) or vehicle, 24h before a single 4-h session of leverpress escape\/avoidance conditioning.","background":"Recent evidence indicates that the pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs) can affect learning and memory processes.","conclusion":"The TNFalpha-treated animals made more avoidance responses and fewer escape responses than controls during the last hour of the session. Further, both TNFalpha- and IL-1beta-treated animals had a higher percent avoidance than controls during the 4th hour of the session. None of the cytokines had an effect on the number of leverpresses during safety, a putative measure of anxiety. Results are discussed in terms of the differential central effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and the possible relationship to avoidance conditioning."},{"method":"Members of the New Zealand Black (NZB) strain revealed steady improvement over the 6 days of training comparable to C57BL\/6 mice. The neurotrophin low affinity receptor p75 knockout mouse, in which the binding region is rendered refractory to ligand, displayed profound deficits in the acquisition of this task. Members of the Swiss Webster strain performed intermediate between the poor performance of the p75 mice and the progressively improving learning curves of the NZB and C57 mice.","background":"Four strains of mice were compared regarding their relative abilities to solve the Morris water maze test of spatial memory.","conclusion":"The present results support the notion that interference with functioning of nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors on forebrain cholingergic neurons negatively impacts the animal's ability to utilize the spatial cues necessary for successful spatial navigation. This effect on NGF receptors was more behaviorally disrupting than the influence of neocortical and hippocampal ectopias as present in the NZB mice. These results support the use of the p75 knockout mouse as a model of forebrain cholinergic neuron dysfunction. On the other hand, these results do not support the use of the NZB mouse as an animal model of human learning disability and dementia."},{"method":"We investigated fetal habituation to vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS).","background":"In this study, we divided 26 fetuses at 32-37 weeks of gestation into three groups using combined criteria of gestational age and behavioral indicators.","conclusion":"Fetuses showed habituation from at least 32 weeks of gestation. Furthermore, fetuses less developed from behavioral standpoint took significantly more trials to achieve habituation than developed fetuses even in the same gestational age. Taken together with these data, it was proved that there was a relationship between aspects of behavioral development and habituation."},{"method":"The objective of this study was to behaviorally test the role of AM complex in a spatial memory task in absence of visual cues. For this purpose, we analyzed memory retention of Lashley III maze in blind rats after bilateral ibotenate lesions in AM complex, or in the primary visual cortex (V1, Oc1), to test the hypothesis that AM complex is essential for this cognitive task.","background":"The primary visual cortex of rats is surrounded laterally (in Oc2L) and medially (in Oc2M) by several peristriate visual areas. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that bilateral lesions in Oc2L result in visual pattern discrimination deficit, and in failure to solve a conditional discrimination which requires figure-background association. In contrast, neurotoxic lesions of the rostral part of Oc2M (which contains the anteromedial and anterior peristriate visual areas, collectively referred to as AM complex) result in deficits in visuospatial discrimination, and in disruptions in visual tasks involving spatial memory.","conclusion":"The results showed a significant loss of memory retention of the maze in rats with lesions in AM complex, but not in rats with lesions in V1. Furthermore, the retention loss in rats with AM complex lesions was positively and significantly correlated with the size of the lesion. The results indicate a critical role of AM complex in spatial memory mechanisms independent on visual cues. A probable homology of rat AM complex with the posterior parietal cortex of primates is discussed."},{"method":"In the present study, anxiety and learning\/memory related behaviors were examined in one-year-old NPY-transgenic rats in order to assess any behavioral changes that may have occurred during the aging process.","background":"The behavioral phenotype of five-month-old rats overexpressing neuropeptide Y (NPY) has previously been described [Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97 (2000) 12852]. In this transgenic rat model, there is central overexpression of prepro-NPY mRNA and NPY peptide in the hippocampus and hypothalamus and decreased Y1 binding sites within the hippocampus. These molecular and neurochemical events led to altered anxiety profile and learning abilities in NPY-overexpressing rats.","conclusion":"As observed in 5-month-old overexpressing rats, aged NPY-transgenic animals are resistant to acute physical restraint stress measured by the elevated-plus maze and demonstrate anxiolytic-like activity in the open field. However, in contrast to data in young rats, there was no significant difference between aged wildtype and NPY-transgenic animals in relation to spatial and non-spatial memory as indicated by the (allo- and ego-centric) Morris water maze and object recognition test. It would thus appear that the anxiolytic-like profile observed in young NPY-overexpressing rats is maintained in older animals providing further evidence for a role for NPY in anxious behaviors. However, the cognitive deficits observed in young rats do not appear to occur in older animals suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms leading to a reversal of the learning deficits noted in younger animals. These results also provide additional evidence for the mechanistic dissociation between anxiety and cognition-related behaviors modulated by NPY."},{"method":"One-hundred and twenty male rats were randomly allocated to OB or sham operated groups and received chronic i.p. treatment with either saline, physostigmine (0.1 mg\/kg) or tacrine (0.1 and 0.3 mg\/kg). Two weeks after beginning treatment animals were tested on the Morris water maze and open field test.","background":"The olfactory bulbectomised (OB) rat is being increasingly used as a model of impaired learning and mnemonic functioning. In this study the model has been utilised to determine the effect of the acetylcholinesterase inhibiting compounds tacrine and physostigmine on spatial working memory deficits associated with the OB rat.","conclusion":"The results indicated that the OB surgery was associated with spatial working memory disturbances that were effectively attenuated with both doses of tacrine, but not physostigmine. Increased hyperactivity and defecation was observed in OB animals in the Open-field test, however, these changes were not ameliorated by either drug treatment. The ability for tacrine but not physostigmine to attenuate OB cognitive deficits may be associated with the different half-life of these compounds. This study provides further support for the use of the OB rat as a drug discovery model for the investigation of novel therapeutic compounds that target the cholinergic system."},{"method":"In order to investigate the role of NMDA receptors in avian NCL for stimulus maintenance and response selection, we trained pigeons in a delayed matching-to sample (DMTS) task, requiring both functions, and a simultaneous matching to sample (SMTS) task, requiring only response selection. After reaching criterion, pigeons had to perform the tasks alternately under local NMDA receptor blockade in NCL (DL-AP5) and after infusion of vehicle (saline solution).","background":"The prefrontal cortex is involved in various aspects of working memory like stimulus maintenance and response selection functions. Neurobehavioral studies and neurocomputational models assume a role for NMDA receptors in prefrontal cortex for maintenance processes, while our previous studies on NMDA receptors in the avian prefrontal cortex-analogue, the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), showed them to be involved in response selection functions. Various tasks used in PFC-related research address in fact both functions, so they cannot disambiguate their separate contributions to performance.","conclusion":"Blockade of NCL-based NMDA receptors led to significant increases in error rates in both DMTS and SMTS--compared with the same subjects' performance during training and in the control condition. However, there was no additional increase in errors due to the additional maintenance component, so the impairment appears to be due to deficits in adequate selection of responses, the function necessary for both tasks. We conclude that NMDA receptors in the pigeon NCL participate in response selection rather than stimulus maintenance in tasks requiring the processing of context information."},{"method":"F1 hybrid mice homozygous for the NR1 hypomorphic mutation (NR1 -\/-) were generated by crossing heterozygous mice (NR1 +\/-) from C57BL\/6 and 129 Sv\/Ev backgrounds. To assess sensorimotor gating, mice were tested in the paradigm of prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle.","background":"Reduced NMDA receptor function is hypothesized to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In order to model chronic and developmental NMDA receptor hypofunction, a mouse line was developed that expresses low levels of the NMDA R1 subunit (NR1) of the NMDA receptor. The present study tested the hypothesis that these NR1 hypomorphic mice would exhibit deficits in sensorimotor and conspecific interactions, analogous to deficits observed in schizophrenic patients.","conclusion":"The NR1 hypomorphic mice exhibited increased acoustic startle responses and also showed deficits in prepulse inhibition. Startle responses were differentially altered by predator odor exposure in the male NR1 -\/- mice, in comparison to control mice. In a test of social affiliation, the wild type mice spent significantly more time investigating a novel mouse in comparison to the NR1 -\/- mice. In a resident-intruder test, marked deficits were found in sex-specific aggressive behavior between the wild type and mutant mice. These data support the contention that the NR1 hypomorphic mice exhibit alterations in sensorimotor gating and typical conspecific interactions, reminiscent of behavioral disturbances associated with schizophrenia. The NR1 hypomorphic mice could represent a model system to explore novel treatment and preventative strategies for certain symptoms of schizophrenia."},{"method":"In the current study, the effect of naloxone on appetitive sexual behaviors was assessed during extinction test trials.","background":"Several studies indicate that opioids are involved in the control of consummatory sexual behavior in male Japanese quail. Naloxone has been reported to increase copulatory responses.","conclusion":"Naloxone was found to substantially reduce appetitive responding, suggesting that opioids differentially affect anticipatory and contact components of sexual behavior."},{"method":"This study is an initial attempt to bridge this knowledge gap. We investigated three major factors potentially influencing the performance of Ts65Dn mice in the water maze: (1) order in which the test is executed; (2) age of the animals; and (3) levels of aversiveness associated with the test. Measurements of plasma corticosterone levels and core body temperature after swimming were also carried out in additional subsets of mice.","background":"The Ts65Dn mouse is the most studied and genetically the most complete animal model of Down syndrome (DS) available. These mice display many DS-like features, including performance deficits in different behavioral tasks, motor dysfunction, and age-dependent loss of cholinergic markers in the basal forebrain. At present, the only robust data demonstrating a behavioral deficit potentially associated with learning and memory in Ts65Dn mice less than 6 months old have come from studies that used some variation of the Morris water maze task. However, the specific features of the water maze deficits seen in these animals are still poorly defined.","conclusion":"Overall, we found that the behavioral phenotype of Ts65Dn mice was milder than previously described in the literature. Additionally, Ts65Dn mice were significantly more responsive to potential stressors and more prone to swim-induced hypothermia than euploid control animals. More studies are needed to tease out further the potential effects of confounding factors on the performance of Ts65Dn mice."},{"method":"Here we describe a novel cued progressive delay task, an analog of the progressive ratio task that minimizes energy expenditure. In this task, rats obtain sucrose reward by entering a reward receptacle in response to a cue and remaining in the receptacle for a required wait that is increased after each successful trial. In an experiment in which the magnitude of reward was varied across sessions, the animals' fail point (maximum wait achieved) was correlated with the amount of reward delivered. Microinjection of D1 or D2 dopamine receptor antagonists into the NAc did not affect the length of time animals were willing to wait for reward (fail point), but did reduce the proportion of cues to which the animal responded.","background":"The choice among behavioral options is influenced by the anticipated cost of working for the reward relative to the anticipated reward magnitude. Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been suggested to play an important role in cost\/benefit computation. From a behavioral perspective, work involves two elements: the caloric expenditure of energy and the time required to complete the task. In many studies of the contribution of NAc dopamine to cost\/benefit decisions, measures of work have conflated these separate elements.","conclusion":"These results suggest that waiting for reward without increased caloric energy expenditure does not require NAc dopamine."},{"method":"Male Wistar rats were given excitotoxic NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) lesions of the DPAG and anterior tectum under halothane, then implanted with blood pressure telemetric probes. Sham lesions were made with saline. Rats were then exposed to cat odor with a hide option, followed 2 weeks later by re-exposure to cat odor without a hide option. Controls were exposed to rat odor in the same way.","background":"Previously we demonstrated Fos expression in the dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG) of the rat following cat odor exposure. Further work correlated the response to cat odor with a sustained blood pressure increase and deployment of defense behavior. It was therefore of interest to determine whether lesions of the DPAG would abolish these two effects of cat odor exposure.","conclusion":"Trends toward attenuation in defense and cardiovascular indices were found in lesioned rats for cat odor exposure with a hide option, but these were not significant. Re-exposure to cat fur without a hide option enhanced the cardiovascular response and under these conditions, lesioned rats showed a significant change of the heart rate and locomotor activity response to cat fur. However, the blood pressure response was not significantly attenuated. Thus, the present results support the Fos data and indicate that the DPAG is involved in the expression of some but not all of the cardiovascular and behavioral components of the response to cat odor."},{"method":"We evaluated the effects of NBM electrical stimulation applied during different phases of the avoidance task. Rats were trained in a 30-trial acquisition session, and were tested again 24 and 48 h later. NBM stimulation was applied at different stages of memory formation of the conditioning: (1) immediately before the first training session to determine the effects on acquisition of the two-way avoidance task; (2) immediately after the first training session to evaluate effects on memory consolidation; and (3) immediately before the 24-h retention session to analyze the effects on the retrieval process.","background":"This study assessed the role of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) in specific memory phases of two-way active avoidance conditioning.","conclusion":"NBM stimulation before training significantly improved the acquisition of the task, without affecting subsequent retention at either 24 or 48 h. Stimulation of the NBM immediately after the first training session slightly impaired performance in the 24-h retention session. Stimulation of the NBM immediately before the 24-h retention session did not affect performance in either the 24 or 48-h retention sessions. Therefore, the NBM may play a more important role in acquisition of memory in aversively motivated conditioning tasks than in consolidation or retrieval of such memories. These results are discussed in the context of attention enhancement and cortical and amygdala activation."},{"method":"Our goal in the present studies was to examine whether deletion of the 5-HT3 receptor produces different effects in adult male and female mice on performance in three behavioral tests. We examined behavior of male and female mice lacking the 5-HT3 receptor (knock-out or KO) and their wild-type (WT) littermates in the Porsolt forced swim test because of its importance in reliably detecting anti-depressant efficacy. In addition, we examined behavior in the defensive withdrawal test and repeated exposure to an open field because behavior in these two tests provides measures of anxiety.","background":"The central serotonin (5-HT) system is important in regulating behaviors associated with anxiety and depression. While a fair amount is known about the role of 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor subtypes in regulating these behaviors, much less is known about the involvement of the 5-HT3 receptor, especially with regards to its role in sex differences in behavior.","conclusion":"In the Porsolt swim test, sex differences were eliminated by deletion of the 5-HT3 receptor while deletion had no effect in the habituation of locomotor activity to repeated exposure to an open field. In the defensive withdrawal test, deletion of the 5-HT3 receptor had more complex effects though these effects tended to be in the opposite direction in males and females. Together these results suggest that the 5-HT3 receptor regulates behavior-related to depression and anxiety differently in males and females. Whether these effects are due to the interaction of 5-HT3 receptor with gonadal hormones requires further examination."},{"method":"We compared behavioral responses of pit vipers and snakes of the viperine genus Bitis to paired targets of different temperatures (i.e. cool and warm balloons), some scented with rodent odors.","background":"Pit vipers use infrared-sensitive pit organs to accurately target homeothermic prey even in the absence of visual cues. It has been suggested that other vipers, including large ambush predators of the genus Bitis, also may use radiant infrared information for predatory targeting.","conclusion":"The rates of tongue flicking, head turning and approaches by pit vipers (Agkistrodon contortrix and Crotalus atrox) were significantly higher toward warm targets than toward cool ones. Moreover, they all were significantly higher in pit vipers than in the vipers Bitis arietans, Bitis gabonica, and Bitis nasicornis. Bitis sp. exhibited no significant differences in their behaviors toward warm versus cool targets. Pit vipers often struck at targets (always the warm target even when paired with a prey-scented cool target), but Bitis sp. never struck at either warm or cool targets. These results show that the behavioral correlates of infrared-based predatory and\/or defensive targeting differ significantly between these two groups of viperid snakes, and suggest that the neural substrates of infrared imaging in crotaline snakes are either absent or functionally distinct in viperine snakes of the genus Bitis."},{"method":"C57BL\/6J mice inoculated via the intraperitoneal route with 301C BSE or control inoculum were monitored on a fortnightly basis. The end point was when a mouse showed clinical signs as opposed to behavioural signs of BSE for two consecutive observations.","background":"Scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) are both progressive neurodegenerative diseases that are transmissible to mice. The onset of clinical symptoms is more subtle and variable in murine BSE than in murine scrapie. Assessment of behavioural changes that occur throughout disease would aid early diagnosis of disease so that more consistent end points could be made and potential therapies could be investigated.","conclusion":"Significant loss of motor function, as assessed by mice balancing on a static rod, was observed consistently from approximately 40 days prior to death. No significant differences in home cage activity (locomotion, rearing) or cognitive function (T-maze alternation) were observed. However, there was an increase in digging by BSE-infected mice from an early stage. This data will aid the standardisation of behavioural tests to characterise and assess the onset of BSE."},{"method":"Here we report considerable sparing of the ability to detect and localize stimuli in the hemifield contralateral to unilateral early lesions of all contiguous visually-responsive primary and extrastriate cortical regions (occipital, visuoparietal, and visuotemporal cortices).","background":"Anatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral studies implicate extrastriate cortex as a major contributor to the sparing of visually guided behaviors following lesions of primary visual cortex incurred early in life.","conclusion":"In the adult cat this same lesion induces a dense blindness and cats are unable to orient to any visual stimulus introduced into the contralesional hemifield. In the absence of cortical circuits, the neural sparing identified following the neonatal lesion is based on the superior colliculus and it occurs despite massive retrograde transynaptic degeneration of large numbers of retinal ganglion cells."},{"method":"The results obtained from rats trained in the visible-platform task were not significantly different from controls. On the contrary, the animals trained in the hidden-platform water maze task showed a memory impairment, when injected with DC-TA 46 at maximal dose of 20mg\/kg and with rolipram at 3 and 30 mg\/kg doses. The effects of these drugs on cyclic nucleotide levels in HF and CP were observed at 30 min and at 24h after drug administration. Thirty minutes after drug injection, we observed an increase of cAMP level, both in HF and in CP. Twenty-four hours after the retention test, we observed that in CP the cAMP intracellular level remained high, while in the HF at effective doses both inhibitors induced cAMP PDE activity, determining a decrease of cyclic nucleotide. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, together with Western blot immunodetection, showed a mRNA and protein induction of PDE4D PDE isoforms, that may account for the increase of PDE activity observed.","background":"In this study, the effects on memory of intraperitoneal post-training administration of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors, DC-TA 46 and rolipram, were tested using a visible\/hidden-platform water maze task. The effects of these compounds on cyclic nucleotide levels in the hippocampal formation (HF) and striatum (CP) were also assessed, by enzymatic immunoassay (EIA).","conclusion":"Our data suggest that, despite cyclic nucleotide increase at 30 min, the fundamental event causing memory impairment, came from the subsequent long time decrease of cAMP levels, due to the post-translational PDE4D induction."},{"method":"To identify the projections to and from cells in iNTSpc which display strong FLI in response to expression of a CTA, anterograde and retrograde tract tracing was used. When appropriate, tract tracing was combined with double labeling for FLI in animals which received CTA training as well as tracer injections and were re-exposed to the CS taste.","background":"Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) expression is associated with strong increases in Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) in a region of the brainstem identified as the parvicellular subdivision of the intermediate nucleus of the solitary tract (iNTSpc).","conclusion":"With respect to afferent projections, iNTSpc receives a strong, direct, ipsilateral projection from amygdala and the distribution of the fiber terminals yields a striking match to that of cells expressing FLI after CTA expression. As for efferent projections, these cells in iNTSpc are characterized by a mixed, rather than homogeneous, projection pattern. Targets of these cells include pons and forebrain as well as local medullary sites, all of which are known to be involved in gastrointestinal function. Thus, activation of these cells may provide a circuit through which gastrointestinal\/visceral responses are coordinated as a component of the conditioned aversion."},{"method":"[(3)H]-Delta(9)-THC was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to rats and the presence of [(3)H]-Delta(9)-THC and metabolites in serum and brain tissue were compared at multiple times post-injection in male versus female rats.

In contrast, levels of Delta(9)-THC metabolites in brain tissue, including 11-hydroxy-Delta(9)-THC, the major active metabolite, were higher in females than in males. To further investigate if greater production of active metabolites by females explained the greater Delta(9)-THC-induced behavioral effects observed in females, i.p. Delta(9)-THC-induced antinociception (50 degrees C warm water tail withdrawal assay) and catalepsy (bar test) were compared in male and female rats following pretreatment with saline or SKF525A, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor.","background":"Cannabinoids have been shown to produce greater behavioral effects in female than in male rats. Sex differences in the metabolism of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) have also been demonstrated in one study. The goal of this study was to determine if sex differences in Delta(9)-THC disposition or metabolism could explain sex differences in Delta(9)-THC-induced behavioral effects.","conclusion":"SKF525A did not affect basal responding in the tail withdrawal assay or bar test in either sex. SKF525A significantly attenuated Delta(9)-THC-induced antinociception only in females. A similar sex difference was observed in the effects of SKF525A on Delta(9)-THC-induced catalepsy.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), a co-substrate for energy transfer in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, is speculated to induce positive effects in some of these diseases.

Previous own experiments revealed an increased NADH level in the rat brain following peripheral application of NADH (10-100 mg\/kg, i.p.+ i.v.). Therefore, we wanted to know, whether or not NADH has an effect on cognitive function in animals.","conclusion":"The repeated administration of NADH improved the performance of old rats in the acquisition phase (place version) and the spatial probe of the Morris water maze compared to vehicle-treated controls. The effect of NADH on learning-related processes is supported by the lack of effects on motor performance on the rota-rod.

With the hippocampus being implicated in behavioural activity aspects, including learning and memory processes, we assessed possible phenotypic consequences of LAR phosphatase deficiency using a battery of rodent behaviour tests.","conclusion":"A spatial learning impairment was found in the difficult variant of the Morris water maze. Exploration, nestbuilding and activity tests indicated that LAR-Delta P mice were more active than wildtype littermates. The observed hyperactivity in LAR-Delta P mice could not be explained by altered anxiety or curiosity levels, and was found to be persistent throughout the nocturnal period.

Both doses of naloxone were effective in blocking the impairing effect of stress, but only higher dose of naloxone blocked dexamethasone-induced impairment. The applied stress increased circulating corticosterone levels as assessed immediately after the retention test, indicating that stress-induced impairment of memory retrieval is mediated, in part, by increased plasma levels of glucocorticoids. These findings further indicate that acute restraint stress and glucocorticoids impair retrieval of long-term memory, and provide evidence for the existence of an interaction between glucocortioids and opiate system on this process."},{"method":"We used a rat model of global perinatal asphyxia to model acute intrauterine asphyxia around the time of birth.

Pups were then given to surrogate mothers, and examined for long-term behavioural effects of the perinatal asphyctic insult. Behavioural assessment included analysis of novelty seeking behaviour at adolescence, while spatial discrimination abilities, response to both an acute and a chronic stress, and the effects of the full D1 receptor agonist SKF 82958 on open field behaviour were assessed at adulthood.","background":"Perinatal asphyxia may induce major neurological deficits shortly after birth as well as neurological\/behavioural disorders later in development.","conclusion":"Overall, no marked abnormalities were found in the novelty seeking test, in the ability to discriminate spatial changes in the test environment and in physiological response to stress. However, adult rats subjected to severe perinatal asphyxia (20 min) showed lower activity level and lower stereotyped behaviour after the administration of SKF 82958 in an open field test. These results support the observations from human and animal studies that perinatal insult can produce long-term dysfunction of dopaminergic neurotransmission, and points to the need of more thorough examination of the potential effects of perinatal asphyxia on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Altogether, the present findings suggest that the present 20 min perinatal asphyxia model might serve for the study of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with perinatal insults."},{"method":"In keeping with these considerations, outbred CD-1 mice of both sexes, which underwent a single 24-h episode of maternal deprivation early in development, were administered the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 (0, 0.5 or 2 mg\/kg i.p.) during adolescence.","background":"Early life adverse experiences have been shown to increase the likelihood of developing later depressive symptoms. In this frame, human adolescents have been suggested to approach psychoactive drugs in order to self-medicate emerging depressive states.","conclusion":"Maternal deprivation reduced the expected interest in socio-sexual interaction with peers during adolescence. When mice were then tested at adulthood in the forced-swim paradigm in drug-free state, the latency to reach a passive floating posture was markedly reduced by early maternal deprivation. Low doses of cannabinoid (0.5 mg\/kg) administered during adolescence were either able to reduce the time spent floating and to increase episodes of active struggling only in control non-deprived animals. As a whole, the emergence of depressive symptoms during both adolescence and adulthood seems to be eased as a consequence of a single\/prolonged episode of early maternal deprivation early in infancy."},{"method":"Experiment 1 investigated the effects of the M(1)-like muscarinic receptor antagonist, pirenzepine infused into the dorsomedial striatum on acquisition and reversal learning. Experiment 2 examined the effects of the nicotinic cholinergic antagonist, mecamylamine injected into the dorsomedial striatum on acquisition and reversal learning.","background":"The present studies determined whether blockade of M(1)-like muscarinic or nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the dorsomedial striatum affects acquisition or reversal learning of a response discrimination. Testing occurred in a modified cross-maze across two consecutive sessions. In the acquisition phase, a rat learned to turn to the left or to the right. In the reversal learning phase, a rat learned to turn in the opposite direction as required during acquisition.","conclusion":"Bilateral injections of pirenzepine at 10 microg, but not 1 microg, selectively impaired reversal learning. Analysis of the errors indicated that pirenzepine treatment did not impair the initial shift, but increased reversions back to the original response choice following the initial shift. Bilateral injections of mecamylamine, 6 or 18 microg, did not affect acquisition or reversal learning. The results suggest that activation of M(1) muscarinic cholinergic receptors, but not nicotinic cholinergic receptors, in the dorsomedial striatum is important for facilitating the flexible shifting of response patterns."},{"method":"Rats were pretreated with an intracerebroventricular (ICV) dose of scopolamine hydrobromide followed by treatment with 1 nmol LVV-H7 or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). During the acquisition phase of the water maze task, daily ICV infusions of 1 nmol of LVV-H7 25 min after scopolamine treatment produced marked improvement in both the latency and distance swum in order to locate the submerged platform using visual cues compared to animals treated with scopolamine only.","background":"Central administration of angiotensin IV (Ang IV) analogues attenuates scopolamine-induced amnesia. Ang IV mediates its effects by binding to a high affinity, binding site, AT(4) receptor, that has recently been identified as insulin regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP). The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the distinct AT(4) ligand, LVV-hemorphin-7 (LVV-H7), on scopolamine-induced learning deficits, one which involves fear-conditioning and the other spatial learning.","conclusion":"In addition, the same dose of LVV-H7 attenuated the learning deficit observed for scopolamine-treated animals in the passive avoidance task. These studies clearly demonstrate that LVV-H7, like Ang IV, is a pharmacologically active AT(4) ligand that attenuates the deleterious effects of scopolamine on learning performance in two different behavioral paradigms."},{"method":"Therefore, yawning behavior was studied in adrenalectomized rats, who then received dexamethasone replacement.","background":"Yawning, a phylogenetic behavior, present in reptiles, birds and mammals, has been studied for several decades, but to date its physiological function is still unknown. The role of stress as well as several peptides and the hypothalamus has been studied in relation to its regulation. To date however, no studies has been carried out to determine the role of the adrenal glands.","conclusion":"The results show that rats whose adrenal glands were removed stopped both spontaneous and apomorphine-induced yawning, while dexamethasone reverted this effect. The results are discussed in terms of the possible role of corticosterone on yawning behavior."},{"method":"In the present study, we investigated the facial expressions elicited in response to four basic taste stimuli, sweet, salty, sour and bitter, in the newborns of two non-human primate species, rhesus macaques and chimpanzees. The taste-elicited facial expressions were compared among the kinds of taste stimuli and between the two species.","background":"Newborn humans are known to show specific facial expressions in response to various kinds of taste stimuli and are presumed to be able to discriminate those kinds of tastes from just after birth. As the closest relatives to humans, the taste reactivity (threshold, preference and taste-elicited facial expression) of non-human primates has long been of great interest. To date, however, there have been few investigations in newborn non-human primates.","conclusion":"Rhesus macaques of less than 7 days old showed different patterns of facial expressions for water\/sweet than for bitter, and chimpanzees less than 30 days old did so for sweet and bitter. The differences between these two species were evident in the presence and absence of certain facial expressions and the emerging patterns of certain components for each stimulus. In particular, chimpanzee response patterns to the bitter stimulus resembled to those of humans rather than rhesus macaques. Overall, rhesus macaques and chimpanzees responded differently to the same kinds of tastes, presumably reflecting differences in their evolutionary backgrounds."},{"method":"Animals that were either repeatedly preexposed (PE) to a tone conditioned stimulus (CS) or naive to the tone (non-preexposed; NPE) subsequently experienced three presentations of the tone paired with footshock. Animals were tested 24 h later in the context of the footshock chamber, and on the following day, in the presence of the tone CS. Changes in heart rate and blood pressure were recorded by radio-telemetry.","background":"This study assessed freezing behaviour and cardiovascular responses during the expression of latent inhibition of conditioned fear.","conclusion":"The PE rats spent more time freezing to the conditioned contextual cues and exhibited higher blood pressures during the last half of the context test session than did the NPE animals. During the tone test, the PE rats exhibited less conditioned freezing to the tone CS compared with the NPE animals, i.e. expression of the latent inhibition. This behavioural effect was associated with a significant increase in heart rate, but not blood pressure, in the PE but not the NPE animals. Our results suggest that the increased blood pressures of the PE rats during the context test directly reflect their greater fear of the conditioning context. In contrast, the increased heart rate response but decreased freezing shown by PE rats in response to the tone CS may be due to the fact that lower stress levels (e.g. PE condition) elicit sympathetically-mediated increases in heart rate, whereas higher stress levels (e.g. NPE condition) activate both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, thus eliminating any CS-induced increase in heart rate in the NPE rats."},{"method":"To that end, memory consolidation was assessed in C57BL\/6J mice using the one-trial step-through inhibitory avoidance task, the compounds being injected immediately after training (foot-shock) and performance measured 24 h later. More specifically, the following effects of thioperamide (1.25-20 mg\/kg) were dose-dependently analysed: (1) its potential direct effects on memory consolidation; (2) its potential reversing effects on retrograde amnesia induced by the NMDA antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801, 0.5 mg\/kg) and (3) its potential reversing effects on the well-known amnesia induced by the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (0.25 mg\/kg).","background":"In the literature, there is some evidence indicating that H3 histamine receptor antagonists, in particular thioperamide, can facilitate learning and memory retrieval in laboratory rodents. The present study aimed at verifying whether this also holds for memory consolidation, a phase of memory for which there is scarcity of convincing data on the effects of H3 receptor antagonists given systemically.","conclusion":"We found that thioperamide exerted a dose-dependent facilitative effect on memory consolidation. Furthermore, the H3 receptor antagonist reversed scopolamine- and especially dizocilpine-induced amnesia. The results strongly support the view that the brain mechanisms of memory consolidation involve a functional interaction between the NMDA and the H3 sites."},{"method":"In a series of 13 releases, birds were tested as binocular controls or monocularly with the right or left-eye covered.","background":"The aim of our study was to analyse the components of visual lateralization in pigeon homing, a large-scale spatial task.","conclusion":"Occlusion of either eye had a significant effect on initial orientation and homing performance. Vanishing bearings were deflected to the side of the open eye, vanishing intervals were longer, and homing speed was reduced. These parameters were affected to a different degree. Initial orientation was markedly lateralized, with birds using their right-eye deviating less from the mean of control birds and showing significantly less variance. One minute after release, the deviation and variance were similarly large in both monocular groups. However, while the right-eyed birds improved their performance until leaving the release site, the left-eyed birds failed to do so. Vanishing intervals were similar in both monocular groups, but homing speed was reduced to a lesser extent in pigeons using the right-eye. The degree of lateralization varied across different releases, but superiority of the right-eye\/left hemisphere prevailed. Lateralization did not depend on familiarity with the release site. This suggests that the crucial processes involved the eyes, but did not depend on visual memory of landscape features at the release site. Results reveal, for the first time, asymmetries of directional orientation as an essential component of lateralized homing performance. As likely mechanisms we suggest hemispheric differences in magnetic compass orientation and in the adjustment to optic flow."},{"method":"Bulbospongiosus EMG, as a measure of penile erection, was recorded along with EEG, EMG, and EOG during normal sleep-wakefulness.

The third aim of this study was to compare (after the above-mentioned treatments) circadian changes in spontaneous motor activity and body temperature in juvenile rats permanently protected from any stress.","background":"Newborn mammals, showing reduced normal body temperature, might be protected against iron-mediated, delayed neurotoxicity of perinatal asphyxia.","conclusion":"Neonatal anoxia at body temperature adjusted (both during anoxia and 2 h reoxygenation) to a level typical of healthy (37 degrees C) or febrile (39 degrees C) adults led to the stress-induced hyperactivity in juvenile (5-45 days old) rats. Both normal neonatal body temperature of 33 degrees C and chelation of iron prevented the hyperactivity in rats. Neither neonatal body temperature nor neonatal anoxia affected spontaneous motor activity or body temperature of juvenile rats, recorded in their home-cages with implantable transmitters. Circadian rhythmicity was also undisturbed. Presented data support the hypothesis that physiologically reduced neonatal body temperature can provide a protection against iron-mediated postanoxic disturbances of behavioural stress responses in juvenile rats."},{"method":"SHR showed significantly lower startle amplitude than Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, but no difference in startle habituation. Baseline percentage prepulse inhibition was higher in SHR and WKY rats than in SD rats. Treatment with amphetamine caused significant disruption of prepulse inhibition in SHR and WKY rats, but not SD rats. In contrast, treatment with apomorphine caused prepulse-dependent disruption of prepulse inhibition in SD rats only. Both MK-801 and 8-OH-DPAT treatment caused disruption of prepulse inhibition in all three rat strains.","background":"Prepulse inhibition is modulated by dopaminergic drugs and is disrupted in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) have been proposed as an animal model of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and show marked alterations of dopaminergic regulation of behaviour.","conclusion":"This study shows differential changes in startle level and prepulse inhibition in SHR, however these rats are not uniformly different from either WKY rats or SD rats and WKY rats differ in a number of respects from SD rats. In conclusion, these data further reveal altered dopaminergic regulation of behaviour in SHR, but also shows that caution is needed about the control strain used to compare these animals with."},{"method":"An inverted U-shaped dose-function was obtained with 0.5 microg producing the greatest increases in the threshold for rewarding brain stimulation which were sustained during the month long tests. No differences between groups in terms of maximum response rates, a measure of performance, were observed. Although all injected groups showed a minor decline in the rate of weight gain over time, percent efficiency of food utilization (percent weight gain\/food intake) was the same across groups, suggesting that metabolic function was not affected by the cytokine.","background":"In the present work, we investigated the short- and long-term effects of a single systemic injection of rat recombinant interleukin-2 on weight, food intake, and brain stimulation reward thresholds elicited from the ventral tegmental area.","conclusion":"In animals with bilateral ventral tegmental area implants, there was no consistent correspondence between the threshold change obtained from ipsilateral stimulation and that associated with the contralateral site; side-to-side differences ranged from 0 to 100%, suggesting a specific interaction between cytokine activity and the locus of rewarding brain stimulation. These data suggest that peripheral IL-2 significantly modifies hedonic processes arising from medial forebrain bundle stimulation in a long-term manner. We further suggest that since this modulation appears to be notably site-specific, IL-2 receptors or its metabolites may not be evenly distributed within the medial forebrain bundle."},{"method":"Two groups of 30 adult subjects were taught a series of conditional visual discriminations. One group received different reward outcomes for each condition, whilst the other group received the same reward outcome for each condition.","background":"Differential reward outcome learning provides a unique reward outcome for each condition of a conditional discrimination task, and this increases the rate at which these tasks can be learned. The present experiment aims to show that irrespective of any difference in learning rate, conditional discrimination tasks and differential reward outcome tasks are solved using different strategies.","conclusion":"Both groups learned the visual discriminations at the same rate. Subjects were then taught a new conditional cue with a subset of previously learnt discrimination problems and then required to transfer the newly learnt instruction cue to the remaining discrimination problems that had been previously learnt. Although both groups appeared to transfer the newly learnt cue at the same rate, the subjects performing the differential reward outcome task learnt to a criterion level of performance with fewer errors.

Dopaminergic degeneration was produced by 6-hydroxydopamine lesion in the median forebrain bundle. The concentrations of dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine and its metabolites were analysed in the various regions of the basal ganglia. The concentrations of noradrenaline and dopamine were measured in the regions innervated by locus coeruleus neurons and in the basal ganglia respectively, after 2-methoxy idazoxan treatment. The Parkinsonian behavior was assessed by catalepsy and activity test.","background":"Noradrenaline, not only functions as a synaptic transmitter, but also promotes neural differentiation and regenerative processes. In Parkinson's disease, besides the dopaminergic degeneration, noradrenergic neurons of locus coeruleus origin degenerate as well. Drugs enhancing noradrenergic transmission in the locus coeruleus (e.g. alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonists) have been shown to be neuroprotective against Huntington's and ischemic animal models. However, in Parkinsonian animal models, most of the studies evaluated the worsening of experimental nigral neurodegeneration after locus coeruleus lesions.","conclusion":"2-Methoxy idazoxan specifically increased the concentration of noradrenaline in the brain regions, innervated by locus coeruleus neurons. 6-OHDA lesion strongly depleted the concentration of dopamine and its metabolites in the striatum and SN, producing catalepsy and hypoactivity. Multiple treatments with 2-methoxy idazoxan reduced some of the observed neurochemical and behavioral indices of 6-hydroxydopamine-induced Parkinsonism, indicating neuroprotection. Although the mechanism underlying the neuroprotective property remains elusive, the therapeutic usage of alpha2-antagonists might be helpful in slowing the neuronal death and progression of Parkinson's disease."},{"method":"To do so, we temporarily inactivated the CA3-subfield by a focal injection of diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) which chelates most of the heavy metals present in this region. The effects of temporary inactivation of the CA3-region were examined in an associative task, the Morris water maze (MWM). To study the different phase of memory we used a new behavioural massed-procedure founded on four massed training sessions in the spatial and the non-spatial (cue) version of this task.","background":"This experiment investigated the involvement of the dorsal hippocampal CA3-region in the different phases of learning and memory in spatial and non-spatial tasks.","conclusion":"In the spatial version, we showed that a bilateral injection of DDC into the CA3-region impairs the acquisition but not the recall of spatial information. The main result of this study is that the same injection performed immediately after the training session also perturbed memory consolidation. In the cue version of the MWM, we found no difference between the DDC-injected mice and their controls in acquisition or memory consolidation of non-spatial information.

Immediately after MPTP treatment C57bl\/6 mice showed reduced running wheel activity which lasted during the entire active phase (20:00 to 08:00 h), recovered to baseline levels in the following 2 days and remained stable up to the end of the experiment. AMPT challenge significantly reduced wheel running activity in MPTP-treated mice in the first 3 h after treatment. Post mortem HPLC analysis detected mean striatal DA levels in saline + saline and saline + AMPT-treated mice of 14.32 and 9.83 ng\/mg, respectively and in MPTP + saline and MPTP + AMPT-treated mice of 1.73 and 0.69 ng\/mg, respectively.","background":"In Parkinson's disease (PD) compensatory mechanisms such as an increase of the de novo biosynthesis of dopamine (DA) are thought to delay the onset of motor impairment.","conclusion":"Taken together, de novo biosynthesis of DA is a crucial component of the compensatory mechanisms which contributes to masking long-term behavioral deficits in the MPTP mouse model. Additionally, wheel running activity might provide a useful tool to study MPTP-induced behavioral deficits, shifts in circadian rhythmicity, and further compensatory mechanisms relevant to PD."},{"method":"In this report we provide evidence that place cues and beacons sequentially control navigation during a single trip to a visible goal. Rats were trained to navigate to a visible escape platform in a circular swimming pool surrounded by numerous visual cues and the kinematics and accuracy of the trajectories to the platform were analyzed. Shortly after initiating a trajectory to the visible platform, animals routinely engaged in stimulus sampling behaviors (e.g., horizontal head scans) which were consistently associated with changes in accuracy (heading error) and swim velocity.","background":"The neurobehavioral dissociation between place navigation and cued navigation has been central to contemporary thinking regarding the psychological processes involved in spatial behavior. In cases where locale (place) cues and taxon cues (e.g., beacons) are present it has been suggested that navigation may be controlled by either stimulus type in isolation, or, alternatively, by both simultaneously.","conclusion":"Subsequently, animals swam quickly and accurately to the visible platform suggesting that the sampling behaviors correspond to a shift in exteroceptive stimulus control. Consistent with this idea, removal or relocation of the platform disrupted navigation following the stimulus sampling behaviors, whereas the initial trajectory was unaffected. In contrast, changes in the distal cue constellation selectively disrupted the initial trajectory. The results showing that navigation to a visible goal is controlled sequentially by locale and taxon cues are discussed in relation to contemporary theories of navigation."},{"method":"In the distal condition, they had to locate the hidden platform on the basis of remote landmarks, while in the proximal condition, they had to rely only on a configuration of proximal objects, placed directly in the pool.","background":"Rats with entorhinal cortex lesions were trained in two versions of the place navigation task in the Morris water maze.","conclusion":"Entorhinal rats were impaired in using distal landmarks but were able to use proximal landmarks to navigate toward the platform. These results suggest that the use of distal and proximal landmarks during navigation involves activation of different neural structures. They also suggest, in agreement with previous data, that there are two distinct landmark-processing systems, one devoted to the processing of proximal landmarks and the other to the processing of distal landmarks."},{"method":"In this work we studied the effect of the local activation of H3 receptors present in substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) on turning behaviour following apomorphine administration to either naive or hemiparkinsonian rats. In naive rats the intranigral (SNr) injection of the H3 receptor agonist immepip (3.2 or 32 ng\/1 microl) resulted in ipsilateral turning following systemic apomorphine (0.5 mg\/kg, subcutaneous). The effect of immepip was related to the dose and prevented by the H3 antagonist thioperamide (5 mg\/kg, intraperitoneal). Conversely, in rats with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions to either substantia nigra pars compacta or the medial forebrain bundle (mfb), apomorphine-induced contralateral turning was reduced by intranigral immepip, an effect prevented by systemic thioperamide.","background":"There is evidence that histamine H3 receptors co-localise with dopamine D1 receptors on the terminals of striato-nigral neurones.","conclusion":"Our data show that H3 receptors present in SNr regulate the synaptic output of the basal ganglia, most likely by reducing GABA release from striato-nigral terminals.

Animals receiving LiCl by injection as well as ingestion demonstrated an exaggerated response. Rats which received LiCl only through intraoral infusions produced the same pattern of decreased ingestive responding to the sucrose plus salt flavored tastant on each test trial suggesting little or no across session conditioning effects.

In contrast, other laboratories have reported that a single exposure to footshock induced a long-term sensitization of both HPA and behavioral responses to novel environments. To test whether these apparent discrepancies can be explained by the use of different stressors or different strains of rats, we studied in the present work the long-term effects of a single exposure to two different stressors (footshock or IMO) in two different strains of rats (Sprague-Dawley from Iffa-Credo and Wistar rats from Harlan).","conclusion":"The long-term effects were higher after IMO than shock. No major changes in behavior in two novel environments (circular corridor, CC and elevated plus-maze, EPM) were observed after a single exposure to shock or IMO in neither strain, despite the fact that shocked rats showed a conditioned freezing response to the shock boxes. The present results demonstrate that long-term stress-induced desensitization of the HPA axis is a reliable phenomenon that can be observed with different stressors and strains. However, only behavioral changes related to shock-induced conditioned fear were found, which suggests that so far poorly characterized factors are determining the long-term behavioral consequences of a single exposure to stress."},{"method":"We therefore examined whether the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of PD in mice could lead to a sensorimotor gating deficit in the prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response (ASR) paradigm. Two MPTP treatment schedules were separately examined here in male C57BL\/6 mice. Post-mortem HPLC analysis confirmed that they were effective in depleting DA in the dorsal striatum (75-88%). PPI was evaluated on days 2, 9 and 16 after the last MPTP treatment; spontaneous locomotor activity was assessed 24 h before each PPI test.","background":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is marked by characterised motor deficits and is accompanied by a severe degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) pathway. It has also been reported that PD patients exhibited additional behavioural deficits, including a deficiency in sensorimotor gating mechanisms.","conclusion":"No significant change in the expression of PPI was detected across the three time points. On the other hand, the MPTP treatment reduced activity on post-treatment day 1. This effect subsided on post-treatment day 8, and was reversed on day 15. The possibility remains therefore that the reported sensorimotor gating deficits in PD patients might stem from structural or neurochemical aberrations beyond those induced by MPTP treatment."},{"method":"Here, we report the effect of mGluR7 gene ablation in different learning paradigms.

In a T-maze reinforced alternation working memory (WM) task, again no difference was seen between groups. However, when increasing the demands on working-memory in a 4-arm and 8-arm maze task, KO mice committed more WM errors than WT littermates thereby uncovering a highly significant difference between the two groups that persisted every day for the whole 9 days of the experiment.

At this early age, both DR and DIO rats on HE diet ate more and had higher leptin levels but gained less body weight and had lower feed efficiency (body weight gain (g)\/food intake (kcal)) than their chow-fed controls. HE diet also prevented the decline in 24h urine corticosterone levels from the third to fifth week observed in chow-fed rats.

Though the preference for higher Tamb during day time coincided with increased sleep, the rats did not move over to higher Tamb prior to the onset of sleep episodes.

In tests of general health, sensorimotor function, and daily activity on a circadian rhythm, p50(-\/-) mice were normal.","background":"The ubiquitous transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB plays a prominent role in regulation of inflammatory immune responses and in cell survival. Recently, it has been found to be active in neurons, and mice lacking NF-kappaB subunits p50 or p65 show deficits in specific cognitive tasks.","conclusion":"Thus, absence of the p50 subunit of the NF-kappaB transcription factor, which results in altered NF-kappaB transcriptional activity in cells throughout the body and brain, alters neuronal circuitry underlying manifestation of emotional behavior. The p50 subunit appears to play a role in normal expression of certain forms of anxiety."},{"method":"The wild-type (+\/+) and homozygous (-\/-) CCK(2) receptor deficient mice of both gender were used throughout the study. The weight gain during the 21-day isolation period and changes in the locomotor activity following the social separation were measured. The elevated plus-maze and resident\/intruder tests were also performed to test alterations in the emotional behaviour.","background":"Neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) regulates the adaptation of rodents in the novel environment. In the present study we analysed the behavioural changes induced by the individual housing in mice, lacking CCK(2) receptors.","conclusion":"Social isolation induced locomotor hyperactivity, reduced weight gain and increased aggressiveness in the wild-type (+\/+) and homozygous (-\/-) male mice. In the wild-type (+\/+) female mice the significant reduction of exploratory activity in the plus-maze was evident. By contrast, in female mice, lacking CCK(2) receptors, the exploration of the plus-maze was not significantly affected by the individual housing. This finding demonstrates that the social isolation does not cause anxiety-like state in the CCK(2) receptor deficient mice. Moreover, the targeted invalidation of CCK(2) receptors increased in male mice the affinity of dopamine D(2) receptors in the sub-cortical structures, whereas in female mice the increased affinity of 5-hydroxytryptamine(2) (5-HT(2)) receptors in the frontal cortex was established. The increased affinity of 5-HT(2) receptors is probably the compensatory change to the lack of CCK(2) receptors in female mice and probably reflects the reduced sensitivity of these animals to the anxiogenic manipulations. In conclusion, targeted mutation of CCK(2) receptors selectively antagonised the behavioural changes induced by the individual housing in females, but not in male mice."},{"method":"All animals were submitted to three sessions of the free-swimming rotatory test in three different sessions (diameter of the recipient = 21 cm; session duration = 5 min; inter-test interval = 48 h). The number and direction of the 30 and 360 degrees turns were recorded. Animals were classified as side-consistent turners (to the right or to the left) when they did not change their preferred side of rotation in all three sessions and in both turning units.","background":"In order to test the hypothesis that the ontogenetic development of the corpus callosum is related to the establishment of behavioral laterality, the rotatory behavior in the free swimming test was studied in male mice of the BALB\/cCF strain, in which approximately 20% of the animals present total or partial callosal agenesis.","conclusion":"In general our results suggested that acallosal animals present more pronounced laterality than normal ones. In the acallosal group, the percentage of consistent turners was significantly higher than that of non-consistent turners. The percentage of animals that presented strong turning preferences in the acallosal group was higher than in the normal group. In first session, the acallosal group presented a higher average number of turns to preferred side than the normal group. Taken together, our results constitute an endorsement to the hypothesis that the normal development of the corpus callosum is related to the establishment of cerebral laterality."},{"method":"Magnetic stimulation was applied through an 8-shaped magnetic coil over primary motor and premotor cortex at a specific time point while executing the first of a three movement sequence.","background":"This study was designed to investigate the effect of single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the isochronic performance of sequential movements which were recorded using a digitising pad.","conclusion":"TMS applied to the premotor cortex showed an alteration effect on the first movement while stimulation of the primary motor cortex influenced the second movement in the sequence. Results suggest that the premotor cortex is involved in online monitoring and controlling of spatio-temporal features of trajectories while the motor cortex contributes to the execution of movements. Isochrony is maintained to a high degree under TMS which has been found in other studies to delay reaction times. The results show that although TMS has a significant influence on motor performance, isochrony is a robust component of motor programs, not readily to be disturbed."},{"method":"Experiment 1 showed that the NMDA receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate acid (AP5) reduces instrumental responding in a dose-dependent fashion. Experiment 2 showed that AP5 given after training eliminates the increase in flexion duration.","background":"Prior studies have shown that circuits within the spinal cord can support a simple form of instrumental learning. Spinally transected rats are given shock to one hind leg whenever the leg is extended. This response-outcome contingency causes an increase in flexion duration. The present experiments examine whether the NMDA receptor is involved in the acquisition and maintenance of this instrumental response.","conclusion":"The results implicate the NMDA receptor in the acquisition and maintenance of spinally mediated instrumental behavior."},{"method":"In the present study, rats were tested in a 12-arm radial-maze subsequently to a daily exposure to 2.45 GHz microwaves (2 micros pulse width, 500 pps, and SAR 0.6 W\/kg) for 45 min.","background":"Mobile communication is based on utilization of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) in the frequency range of 0.3-300 GHz. Human and animal studies suggest that EMFs, which are in the 0.1 MHz-300 GHz range, might interfere with cognitive processes. In 1994, a report by Lai et al. [Bioelectromagnetics 15 (1994) 95-104] showed that whole-body exposure of rats to pulsed 2.45 GHz microwaves (2 micros pulse width, 500 pps, and specific absorption rate [SAR] 0.6 W\/kg) for 45 min resulted in altered spatial working memory assessed in a 12-arm radial-maze task. Surprisingly, there has been only one attempt to replicate this experiment so far [Bioelectromagnetics 25 (2004) 49-57]; confirmation of the Lai et al. experiment failed.","conclusion":"The performance of exposed rats was comparable to that found in sham-exposed or in naive rats (no contact with the exposure system). Regarding the methodological details provided by Lai et al. on their testing protocol, our results might suggest that the microwave-induced behavioral alterations measured by these authors might have had more to do with factors liable to performance bias than with spatial working memory per se."},{"method":"Post-synaptic GABA(B) responses are strongly statistically associated with other properties (such as high membrane resistance) which are, themselves, dependent on a bird's past history. There is also evidence that their incidence changes with prior training in vivo and with age.","background":"Post-synaptic GABA(B) responses (slow, late hyperpolarisations which can be eliminated by perfusion with phaclofen) can be recorded in vitro from many, but not all, neurones in the intermediate medial hyperstriatum ventrale (IMHV). The IMHV is an area of the chick forebrain which is remarkable for its plasticity, and for its essential role in two specific types of early learning-imprinting, and a form of one-trial passive-avoidance learning.","conclusion":"GABA(B) hyperpolarisations are always offset to a varying extent by excitatory NMDA components. These two components follow a very similar time-course, so that the duration and (to a lesser extent), the magnitude of a response is controlled by the balance between the two systems. The evidence suggests that this balance fluctuates, and that its fluctuations determine the extent to which any neurone can function as a coincidence detector."},{"method":"Left-sided ventrolateral cervical spinal cord injury was performed in adult female Long-Evans rats. The behavioural abilities of these animals were analyzed at 2 days, and weekly for up to 5.5 weeks following spinal cord injury. Behavioural testing consisted of Von Frey filament testing, ladder walking, a paw usage task, and the assessment of ground reaction forces during unrestrained trotting.","background":"The purpose of this study was to determine the importance of the pathways running in the ventrolateral spinal funiculus for overground locomotion in adult, freely behaving rats.","conclusion":"Animals with injury to the left ventrolateral cervical spinal cord did not develop enhanced sensitivity to pedal mechanical stimulation. At 2 days following injury, animals had impaired skilled locomotion as indicated by increased number of footslips during ladder walking. At 2 days, these animals also used both limbs together more often for support while rearing, while using the forelimb ipsilateral to the injury less than did uninjured animals. Ground reaction force determination revealed that animals tend to bear less weight on the forelimb and hindlimb ipsilateral to the spinal cord injury 2 days after injury. All animals recovered normal or near normal sensorimotor abilities although subtle asymmetries in ground reaction forces were detectable at 5.5 weeks following spinal cord injury. These results suggest that axons in the ventrolateral spinal funiculi contribute to limb movements during exploration and locomotion but their roles can be served by other pathways after ventrolateral spinal injury."},{"method":"This study examined the effect of hypothyroidism and stress on hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in rats using the novel radial arm water maze (RAWM), which measures spatial working memory. Hypothyroidism was accomplished by thyroidectomy and 2 weeks later a form of intruder stress was used as the chronic psychosocial stressor. After 4-6 weeks of stress, rats were trained to learn (during the acquisition phase; four trials) and then remember (during two memory test trials occurring 15 and 120 min after the acquisition phase) the within-day location of a hidden escape platform, which was in different arm every day. The number of errors (entry into arms other than the platform arm) was noted.","background":"Both hypothyroidism and stress interfere with cognitive function in patients.","conclusion":"Within-day learning of the platform location was largely unaffected by the experimental manipulations, indicating that rats in all groups were equally capable of finding the platform to escape from the water with similar numbers of errors (P &gt; 0.005). The number of days a rat took to reach a criterion (DTC; a maximum of one error in three consecutive days) indicated that chronic stress or hypothyroidism, alone, resulted in a mild impairment of spatial memory, and the combination of chronic stress and hypothyroidism resulted in a more severe and long-lasting memory impairment. The data indicated that the combination of stress and hypothyroidism produced more deleterious effects on hippocampal function than either chronic stress or hypothyroidism alone."},{"method":"Male and female domestic chicks were trained binocularly to localise food buried under sawdust in the centre of a square-shaped enclosure. They were then tested binocularly and monocularly (Experiment 1).

Males rely upon local information (beacon) more than females, also showing stronger encoding of this information in their left hemisphere than their right hemisphere."},{"method":"This study analyzes the effects on behavior, mononuclear proliferative response and central monoamine activity in response to the inoculation of tumor cells in mice submitted to social stress. Two groups of male OF1 mice were used, one of which was inoculated with B16 melanoma cells. Both groups were subdivided into two new groups, with one being submitted to social stress through sensory contact model with a selected aggressive subject, and the other being handled without social interaction. Subjects were exposed to social stress for a 24-h period, with three 5 min intervals of direct physical interaction, where the behavior was recorded and assessed. One hour after the stress and\/or handling, they were put down and samples taken for physiological assessment.","background":"Through the proinflammatory cytokines secreted in response to inflammation or injury, the immune system produces physiological and behavioral alterations.","conclusion":"Significant behavioral changes were found in subjects with implanted tumors, mainly characterized by an increase in avoidance behavior and a decrease in immobility, defense-submission and non-social exploration behavior, coupled with an increase in the spleen mononuclear cell proliferative response. Similarly, an increase was observed in the density of dopamine(2) (D(2))-receptors in the striatum (SRT) and an increase in dopaminergic (DOPAC\/DA) and serotonergic (5HIAA\/5HT) turnover in the hypothalamus. The increase in the density of D(2)-receptors in the SRT coincides with the decrease in some behaviors with a predominant motor component. The results indicate significant changes in the defensive strategy used to cope with situations of intense social stress in mice bearing tumors."},{"method":"The birds were trained to find the location of a food site among four identical feeders arranged on the aviary floor. Extra-maze cues were present. The birds had to perform the task from four different starting points. Successful visits and the time to find the food were recorded.","background":"We tested the role of the hippocampus in spatial memory of zebra finches.","conclusion":"Hippocampal lesions made before acquisition led to a decrease in correct choices. Hippocampal lesions following training disrupted the retention of the spatial memory. Surprisingly, birds with hippocampal damage reached the food as quickly as intact birds, but they needed more visits to find the correct feeder. Therefore, the birds with hippocampal damage used an alternative, nonspatial memory-based strategy to find the food."},{"method":"In the second experiment, groups of mice of the CBA\/H, C57BL\/6 and DBA\/2 strains were submitted to 7 weeks of UCMS. Measures of the sucrose consumption, the evaluation of the physical state and the measurement of body weight were weekly assessed.

These strains were chosen among 11 strains that were tested in a first experiment for their sucrose consumption and preference for sucrose solutions of different concentrations.","conclusion":"UCMS induced a significant decrease of the sucrose consumption in CBA\/H and in C57BL\/6 but not in DBA\/2 mice. The UCMS effect on sucrose intake in CBA\/H mice was associated with a body weight loss and a physical state degradation. Spatial learning in a water maze was not disturbed by UCMS, however, a long-term memory impairment was observed in CBA\/H stressed mice during a probe test. In the Y-maze, UCMS did not modify spontaneous alternation. These results show both an anhedonic-like and an amnesic effect of UCMS in CBA\/H mice.

In order to identify subpopulations of neurons mediating the sensorimotor gating deficit and the hippocampal gamma wave increase, 0.14-0.21 microg of p75 antibody conjugated to saporin (192 IgG-saporin) was injected into the medial septum to selectively lesion the septohippocampal cholinergic neurons.","background":"The involvement of the septohippocampal system on the impaired sensorimotor gating induced by phencyclidine (PCP) or by an electrically induced hippocampal seizure was examined in behaving rats.

It is concluded that increase in neural activity in the medial septum participates in the impairment of sensorimotor gating and the increase in hippocampal gamma waves induced by PCP or a hippocampal AD.

The induction of Cu,Zn-SOD was more pronounced than that of Mn-SOD after Abeta (1-42) insult. However, the concomitant induction of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) in response to significant increases in SOD activity was not seen in animals treated with Abeta (1-42).

Additionally, loading the arm with an added mass of 4kg significantly changed the dynamics of motion: movements were indeed more prolonged under loaded conditions. In both cases, the duration of simulated movements mirrored that of overtly executed movements.

Generally, these effects became apparent approximately two weeks after the lesion. In addition to these effects, PM lesions placed on or close to the midline also produced small transient reductions in rewarding effectiveness immediately after the lesion, an effect that disappeared within three days. Conversely, lateral PM lesions were associated either with no immediate effects or with small transient potentiations of reward.

Despite increased DA levels in the striatum and nucleus accumbens as a response to L-DOPA, the treatment had no influence on general motor activity. Central serotonin, NE, and Epi systems were not affected in any brain region by oral L-DOPA treatment.","background":"The dopamine (DA) precursor, L-DOPA (500 microg), was injected into living crickets, which were ingested (one each) by adult male Anolis carolinensis. This method of delivery elevated plasma L-DOPA and DA concentrations by approximately 1000-fold. In contrast, plasma epinephrine (Epi) and norepinephrine (NE) were not influenced by L-DOPA treatment, although they were elevated following the consumption of the cricket.","conclusion":"In addition, aggression was inhibited by this dose of L-DOPA, even though there was no effect on serotonergic systems. This is surprising because controlling aggressive behavior is usually considered the province of serotonergic activity. Aggression was measured before and after treatment, and while saline-treated lizards retained the full vigor of aggressive activity, those fed a cricket injected with L-DOPA were only one-third as aggressive after treatment. As L-DOPA treatment did not affect general motor activity, the effect appears to be directly associated with aggression. This is supported by the observation that L-DOPA treatment delayed latency to eyespot darkening, which predicts the latency to aggression."},{"method":"The effects of a single administration of donepezil (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg kg(-1), p.o.) and metrifonate (30, 60, and 120 mg kg(-1), p.o.) were investigated in adult Harlan-Wistar rats trained to a stable level of performance and pretreated with scopolamine (0.5 mg kg(-1), i.p. 30 min before training).

Infarct volumes were measured from nitroblue tetrazolium-stained sections at the end of follow-up.","background":"The present study evaluated the effect of galanthamine, a selective competitive cholinesterase inhibitor, on histological and functional outcome after experimental stroke in rats. Cholinesterase inhibitors are commonly used as cognitive enhancers for dementia in aged people, including those who may sustain ischemic attacks.","conclusion":"Infarct volumes in the cortex were similar in ischemic controls and ischemic rats treated with galanthamine. In the beam-walking test, there was a transient impairment forelimb function and a permanent impairment in hindlimb after cortical infarct both in young adult and aged rats. Galanthamine treatment did not affect the sensorimotor recovery rate. Analysis of water-maze data did not reveal significant differences in length of path, escape latency, or swim speed between sham-operated, ischemic controls and ischemic rats treated with galanthamine.

However, the mechanism by which stress influences depression is largely unknown, in part due to the fact that few animal models of repeated stress produce robust changes in depression-like behavior.","conclusion":"The repeated CORT injections had no significant effect on activity levels or anxiety in the open-field or social interaction tests. However, they did increase depression-like behaviors in the forced swim test. Repeated restraint stress had no significant effect on anxiety or depression-like behavior on any of the behavioral tests.

In the subchronic mild stress, mice from the C57BL\/6 and the CBA strains displayed low sensitivity when compared with mice from all the others strains. A stepwise multiple regression analysis suggests that behaviour in the elevated plus-maze is associated with the time of immobility in the forced swim test (20%) and with the susceptibility to the unpredictable subchronic stress procedure (31%). The behaviour in the free exploratory paradigm is slightly associated with behaviours in the two tests of depression.

Central leptin and insulin administration can suppress the rewarding impact of the stimulation. To determine whether there are additional peripheral signals that mediate the effect of weight loss on brain reward circuitry, we assessed changes in LH-self-stimulation following food restriction in the obese Zucker rat which develops resistance to circulating leptin and insulin. In addition, we examined the impact of acute food deprivation and leptin administration on LH self-stimulation in lean and obese Zucker rats.","conclusion":"Restriction reduced frequency thresholds in a subset of lean and obese rats, whereas BSR was unaltered by acute food deprivation. Despite impairment in leptin signaling, intraventricular leptin (4 microg) increased thresholds in most lean and obese rats in which the rewarding effect was sensitive to restriction.

In previous studies individuals from a RD line (rightward turning when facing a dummy predator) and those from a LD line (leftward turning) were subjected to several other laterality tests (most of which, possibly all, were visually based). Since they obtained opposite scores in all tests, it was suggested that LD and RD fish have complete mirror-reversed organizations of the brain.","conclusion":"The results of the first three tests are congruent with the finding of previous studies in that fishes of the two lines showed opposite direction of lateralisation. When tested for laterality in the escape response to a fast approaching stimulus, fish of the LD and RD lines showed no differences and both were biased toward leftward escape. Overall these results suggest the existence in G. falcatus of a single mechanism controlling a co-ordinate placement of the great majority of lateralised functions.

Control animals received multiple infusions of vehicle at the same volume. Behavioral testing was carried out between each infusion, including forelimb-use and somatosensory function. A symptomatic threshold was established for each animal, indicating the amount of neurotoxin required to induce a stable deficit.","background":"The causes of nigrostriatal neuron degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) are not known, but it has been suggested that exogenous or endogenous factors or neurotoxins may play a role. The degree of vulnerability to neurotoxins or other potential mediators of nigral dopamine cell death is thought to be important in understanding Parkinson's disease. In most animal models, the rate of terminal degeneration and corresponding functional impairment is too rapid to investigate effectively either cell vulnerability or the potential benefits of some neuroprotective treatments.","conclusion":"Oral administration of L-DOPA (Sinemet) ameliorated limb-use asymmetries acutely. An immunocytochemical assay for tyrosine hydroxylase, a dopamine cell marker, revealed a partial loss of immunoreactive cells in the substantia nigra. Animals that were co-administered methylphenidate (MPH), a dopamine transport inhibitor, along with the 6-OHDA were spared from the behavioral and neurochemical effects of 6-OHDA, despite receiving more than twice as much neurotoxin as controls.

As in previous anxiety tests, the results were mixed; some measures (reduced dark time) suggested lesioned mice were less anxious; others (fewer light-dark transits) suggested greater anxiety. However, lesioned mice only made fewer transits when the door was small. This suggested that the tendency to enter small holes, so characteristic of small rodents, was reduced; subsequent tests showed lesioned mice preferred to explore in an alley rather than enter its attached tunnels. Further tests of \"species typical\" behaviours revealed that lesioned mice spent less time digging and climbing, and made less use of cardboard shelters in their cages. This was not due to inactivity; lesions did not reduce grooming or locomotion. Finally, tests of hyponeophagia showed hippocampal lesions reduced this measure of anxiety, so long as the control baseline was sufficiently high.","background":"The hippocampus is believed to play an important role in spatial cognition and anxiety. Much of the supporting evidence is derived from rat studies. Recent reports on hippocampal lesioned mice also showed impairments in spatial function, but anxiety was not uniformly diminished. There were, however, striking impairments in several \"species typical\" behaviours; lesioned mice made poorer nests, and hoarded and burrowed less.","conclusion":"Overall, the results suggest that the hippocampus is important in many species-typical behaviours, potentially influencing performance in a range of behavioural tests.

It is recognized that the release of extracellular glutamate from nerve terminals is counterbalanced by the functions of neuronal and glial glutamate transporters.","conclusion":"Co-administration of MS-153 at a dose of 10 mg\/kg, but not 3 mg\/kg, significantly attenuated the induction of conditioned place preference to morphine, methamphetamine and cocaine. However, MS-153 itself produced neither conditioned place preference nor aversion. On the other hand, co-administration of MS-153 (10 mg\/kg) did not alter the acute locomotor activation elicited by a single injection of morphine, methamphetamine and cocaine.

When EE rearing was delayed for 2 weeks after injury, the injury effect was absent and the effect of rearing even stronger. Memory testing in the early EE groups using a delayed probe trial showed an effect of injury and housing, with the sham EE animals benefiting the most. After the delayed EE, sham EE animals again showed more probe target hits, while FPEE animals did not, demonstrating an enduring memory deficit.

However, we failed to detect any significant deficits during reference, reversal or probe tests in the Morris water maze or in a spontaneous alternation task up to the age of 34 weeks old.

In conclusion MC4 receptor antagonists with different selectivity profile, induce anti-allodynic effects in one of the most relevant neuropathic pain model. In addition the expression of AgRP in spinal cord and DRG suggests an endogenous tonic inhibitory control on MC system activity. In pathological conditions this steady control could be insufficient to cope with an over activated MC system leading to increase in nociception.

Fifteen minutes before conditioning mice received a bilateral intrahippocampal injection of either the NMDA receptor antagonist AP5 (0.5 or 1 microg per 0.5 microl per side) or of anisomycin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis (62.5 microg per 0.5 microl per side).

Nicotine consumption at the highest nicotine concentration tested (100 microg\/ml) showed low, but significant, correlations with the number of [3H]-cytisine binding sites in the hippocampus (r=0.307) and the number of [125I]-alpha-bungarotoxin binding sites in the cortex (r=-0.328). No significant correlations between alcohol consumption and the number of either [3H]-cytisine or [125I]-alpha-bungarotoxin binding sites was observed. A polymorphism in the nicotinic receptor alpha4 subunit gene, Chrna4, showed a trend with nicotine consumption and a significant association with alcohol consumption in female but not male mice. These results indicate that common genetic factors influence nicotine and alcohol consumption in mice. However, neither individual differences in the expression of [3H]-cytisine or [125I]-alpha-bungarotoxin binding nicotinic receptors nor the polymorphism in Chrna4 likely contribute to the genetic overlap that influences the consumption of both of these drugs of abuse in C57BL\/6xC3H\/HeJ F2 mice."},{"method":"When the position of the correct screen was the only available cue (i.e., the two screens were identical) binocular and monocular chicks could easily locate the goal, and the same occurred when the visual characteristics of the screens (no matter what their spatial position) were the only relevant information available and when object- and position-specific cues were both available and in agreement (i.e., the two screens were different and maintained fixed spatial locations). In contrast, when object- and position-specific cues were available but were put in conflict (the two screens were different and were swapped during the delay time) left-eyed and binocular chicks went to the correct position, whereas right-eyed chicks seemed to choose both the correct spatial position and the correct object cue to the same degree.

Post-operative DRL performance was monitored, along with performance on 'domestic' and other tests, which provided additional measures of disease progression.","background":"In differential reinforcement of low rates of responding (DRL) tasks, animals are trained to respond for rewards that become available only after some set time has elapsed since the animal's previous response. DRL performance is impaired by hippocampal lesions regardless of their precise location, and can be measured using automated operant equipment, whereas spatial tasks are selectively impaired by dorsal, but not ventral hippocampal lesions, and are typically conducted by hand. Earlier studies of prion infection following dorsal hippocampal micro-injections of scrapie have shown clear impairments of spatial alternation, but these occurred significantly later than dysfunction in hippocampus-dependent 'domestic' tasks such as nesting or burrowing.","conclusion":"Animals with scrapie developed a clear DRL deficit at approximately the same time as their deficits on the other tests became apparent, and long before clinical signs were detectable. DRL deficits thus appeared earlier in the sequence of disease progression than previously reported for spatial alternation, suggesting that early signs of scrapie infection are caused in part by neuronal dysfunction extending beyond the dorsal hippocampal region of initial infection."},{"method":"Sixteen-month-old, but not 4-month-old, transgenic mice showed aberrations in post-shock freezing during training. In a retention test carried out 24 h after training, Tg2576 mice showed comparable levels of conditioned fear elicited by contextual cues.","background":"The processing of emotional and\/or fear-related events is abnormal in patients with Alzheimer's disease. AD is accompanied by a number of neuropathological features, one of which is the deposition of amyloid plaques. The main aim of the present study was to examine the effects of a human amyloid precursor protein mutation on both the acquisition and expression of fear conditioning in Tg2576 mice.","conclusion":"However, freezing elicited by a tone conditioned stimulus was impaired in 16-month-old but not 4-month-old Tg2576 mice. The results are discussed with reference to the role of cue competition (overshadowing) in revealing fear conditioning deficits in Tg2576 mice."},{"method":"Male, territorial sparrows were injected with either vehicle or a 10 mg\/kg dose of fluoxetine. One hour later, aggression was measured using a simulated territorial intrusion. Depending upon when birds were sampled, the aggression scores for vehicle and fluoxetine treatments were grouped according to the number of days after territorial behaviour was initiated. The three groups were: early, days 1-5; middle, days 6-10; and late, days 11-15.","background":"In order to understand the physiological role of serotonin in regulating aggressive behaviour it is important to understand how this neuromodulator acts within the context of a naturally fluctuating social and physical environment. To accomplish this, we examined the effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine during the breeding season in free-living male American tree sparrows (Spizella arborea) in Northern Alaska. During this time period males are maximally aggressive towards territorial intruders.","conclusion":"There was a significant overall difference between groups (F(5,36)=5.18, P&lt;0.0015). Post hoc analysis demonstrated that the level of aggression did not differ between the three groups of saline injected birds. However, fluoxetine injected birds showed a time dependent decrease in aggression. When compared to control birds the middle and late fluoxetine groups had significantly less aggression. Furthermore, the late group of fluoxetine treated birds were significantly less aggressive than the early group of fluoxetine birds. This demonstrates that free-living male ATSPs show a rapid change in their behavioural response to fluoxetine across the first 2 weeks of the breeding season. The rapidity of the change in responsiveness suggests a dynamic sensitivity of the serotonergic system."},{"method":"In the piriform cortex, both T and P rats exhibited a higher immunoreactivity on the first day, which seemed to indicate a novelty-related Fos expression in this area, but whatever the learning-stage, no significant difference in Fos expression between T and P rats was observed.","background":"By using Fos immunocytochemistry, we investigated the activation in olfactory-related areas at three stages (the first and fourth days of conditioning and complete acquisition) of an olfactory discrimination learning task. The trained rats (T) had to associate one odour of a pair with water-reward within a four-arm maze whereas pseudo-trained (P) rats were only submitted to the olfactory cues without any reinforcement.","conclusion":"In hippocampus, Fos expression was significantly different between T and P rats in CA1 and CA3 on the first and fourth days respectively. Thus we showed a differential activation of CA1 and CA3 subfields which might support a possible functional heterogeneity. In the orbitofrontal cortex, Fos immunoreactivity was significantly higher in T rats compared to P rats when mastery of the discrimination task was complete. In contrast, no learning-related Fos expression was found in infralimbic and prelimbic cortices.

Changes in LI thus reflect greater or lesser retardation of learning which essentially implies a potentiation or an attenuation of the LI effect. LI has proved sensitive to psychotomimetic and antipsychotic treatment, which has encouraged its use to model learning and attention deficits in schizophrenia.","conclusion":"PCP was found to potentiate LI when administered acutely prior to the conditioning trails, while no such effect was observed when administered prior to the preexposure trials. D-AMP, on the other hand, disrupted LI possibly due to a failure to induce a persistent taste aversion conditioning."},{"method":"In the present study we showed that neonatal hypoxia-ischemia retarded the development of somatic growth and several neurological reflexes (ear twitch, grasping, gait and negative geotaxis).","background":"Severe perinatal hypoxia-ischemia is an important cause of brain injury in both full-term and premature newborns, with a high risk of future behavioral and neurological deficits. The most commonly used animal model of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia is the unilateral ligation of the common carotid artery followed by exposure to hypoxia in 7-day-old rats. In spite of the wide use of this model, lot of contradictions and discrepancies exist between the results obtained by different laboratories regarding behavioral deficits and there are no data regarding the possible delay of the appearance of neurological reflexes and the time-course of reflex performances following neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury in rats.","conclusion":"Hypoxic animals also displayed retarded performance in righting, geotaxis and gait reflexes. Although hypoxic pups performed worse in most tests for motor coordination, they reached normal levels by 5 weeks of age except in the footfault test. In the open-field, hypoxic animals were generally more active, except at 3 weeks, when activity of normal pups increased enormously as well.

In addition, this mouse model of Alzheimer's disease was also marked by a crooked swimming trajectory. APP23 mice were also of lighter weight and were less inclined to stay immobile during a transfer arousal test. Despite the neurologic signs, APP23 transgenic mice were not deficient in stationary beam, coat-hanger, and rotorod tests, indicating intact motor coordination abilities."},{"method":"This study explored whether the newly-developed Intellicage system could be used to compare these species in simple spatial learning paradigms. The Intellicage is essentially a group-housing cage that also allows continuous automatic recording of each individual's behaviour. Seven wild-caught bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) were compared with seven wild-caught long-tailed wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) in the Intellicage system over 9 days. During the first 90 min after entering the cage, the wood mice were substantially more exploratory than the bank voles (P = 0.003). Over subsequent days, both species showed nocturnal activity increases with voles being 3.7 times more active overall.","background":"Our previous work has revealed very high baseline neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of wood mice as compared particularly to bank voles; a difference which may be related to learning capacity.","conclusion":"In the spatial learning paradigms, there were significant species-by-time interactions with wood mice outperforming bank voles on both place learning (P = 0.027) and subsequent reversal (P = 0.006). Conclusions are firstly that the wood mice show superior learning abilities in this paradigm, and secondly that the Intellicage serves as a valuable cognitive testing arena for small wild rodents, or for circumstances where cognition must be compared independent of different responses to handling or novel environments."},{"method":"Here, we present a behavioral analysis of Cx36-deficient mice. Activity patterns, exploratory- and anxiety-related responses were largely unaffected by elimination of Cx36, while sensorimotor capacities and learning and memory processes were impaired.","background":"Gap junction channels, composed of connexin (Cx) proteins, are conduits for intercellular communication and metabolic exchange in the central nervous system. Connexin36 (Cx36) is expressed in distinct subpopulations of neurons throughout the mammalian brain. Deletion of the Cx36 gene in the mouse affected power and frequency of gamma and sharp wave-ripple oscillations, putative correlates of memory engram inscription.","conclusion":"Repeated testing on the rotarod suggested that the Cx36-deficient mice showed slower motor-coordination learning. After a retention interval of 24 h the Cx36-deficient mice showed habituation to an open-field, but failed to habituate to a more complex spatial environment (Y-maze). A more pronounced memory impairment was found when Cx36 knockout mice had to remember recently explored objects. Cx36-deficient mice were unable to recognize objects after short delays of 15 and 45 min. These data suggest that lack of Cx36 induces memory impairments that vary in dependence of the complexity of the stimuli presented.

Both drugs had no effect on escape latency and traveled distance of a non-spatial visual discrimination task. These results suggest a differential role of 5HT(2A\/2C) and 5HT(3) receptors during spatial learning that ritanserin improves rat performance in spatial discrimination task whereas granisetron impairs it."},{"method":"Data analysis was carried out using conventional averaging techniques as well as source localization with low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). ERPs were recorded in response to point-light displays of a walking person, an inverted walking person and displays of scrambled motion.","background":"In the present study, we investigated how different processing stages involved in the perceptual analysis of biological motion (BM) are reflected by modulations in event-related potentials (ERP) in order to elucidate the time course and location of neural processing of BM.","conclusion":"Analysis yielded a pronounced negativity with a peak at 180 ms after stimulus onset which was more pronounced for upright walkers than for inverted walkers and scrambled motion. A later negative component between 230 and 360 ms after stimulus onset had a larger amplitude for upright and inverted walkers as compared to scrambled walkers. In the later component, negativity was more pronounced in the right hemisphere revealing asymmetries in BM perception. LORETA analysis yielded evidence for sources specific to BM within the right fusiform gyrus and the right superior temporal gyrus for the second component, whereas sources for BM in the early component were located in areas associated with attentional aspects of visual processing. The early component might reflect the pop-out effect of a moving dot pattern representing the highly familiar form of a human figure, whereas the later component might be associated with the specific analysis of motion patterns providing biologically relevant information."},{"method":"This study tests this hypothesis using context and cue fear conditioning. Pups were isolated for 1h a day on postnatal (PN) days 2-9 or were non-handled and were then tested in adulthood (PN70-90).

ISO facilitates appetitive response learning in adult female, but not male rats, and enhances corticosterone levels and stress responsivity in infant and juvenile rats of both sexes. Corticosterone acts at brain areas such as hippocampus that are rich in glucocorticoid receptors, differentiate postnatally, are sexually dimorphic, and involved in learning. Thus, ISO is hypothesized to alter aversive learning in adult rats in a sex-specific manner.","conclusion":"ISO had a sex-selective effect on context-induced USVs that may reflect changes in foot shock sensitivity. ISO increases foot shock sensitivity and tends to enhance context-induced fear in female rats, whereas ISO tends to impair context-induced fear in male rats. Overall, male rats show greater conditioned fear, and female rats show greater unconditioned fear as well as enhanced responses to the aversive and appetitive stimuli. The sex-specific effect of ISO on context fear may reflect neuronal reorganization in stress responsive areas and\/or sex differences in some unconditioned responses."},{"method":"This study shows that adult male mice lacking both creatine kinase isoforms (CK--\/-- double knockout mice) have a reduced body weight, and demonstrate a severely impaired spatial learning in both a dry and a wet maze, lower nestbuilding activity and diminished acoustic startle reflex responses when compared to age-matched male wildtype mice with the same genetic background. In contrast, their visual and motor functions, exploration behaviour, prepulse inhibition and anxiety-related responses were not changed, suggesting no global deficit in sensorimotor function, hearing or motivation.

In addition, locomotor activity test (LAT) was also performed to examine the neuromuscular function.","background":"Rodent chronically injected with D-galactose (D-gal) has been used as an animal aging model for brain aging or anti-aging pharmacology research. However, the dosage of D-gal used to establish this model in mice has been reported in a wide range.","conclusion":"In comparison of vehicle (0.9% saline)-treated mice, D-gal-treated mice at dose of high (200 mg\/kg per day) and middle (100 mg\/kg per day) doses showed significant longer latency to platform and less target quadrant search time and distance in MWM In ORT, D-gal at high and middle doses reduced the discrimination index (DI) of mice more significantly than low dose (50 mg\/kg per day), although all three doses of D-gal reduced the DI of mice significantly. Furthermore, D-gal at high and middle doses significantly decreased locomotor activity of the mice in LAT. Throughout three tests, D-gal induced behavioural impairments in C57 mice at high and middle doses tended to be in the same degree. These results indicate that d-gal can induce the behavioural impairment of C57 mice in a dose-dependent manner from 50 to 100 mg\/kg, higher dose than 100 mg\/kg cannot further deteriorate its behavioural performance."},{"method":"We tested for a causal relationship between the two findings by employing B6N (expressing alpha-synuclein), B6JOla (not expressing alpha-syn) and the third strain C57BL\/6JCrl (B6Jax, expressing alpha-syn).","background":"C57BL\/6 mice are commonly used as background strains for genetically modified mice, and little attention is usually paid to the notification of the specific substrain.

In contrast, B6N showed persistent fear over the course of extinction training. The differences in extinction between B6JOla and B6N were unrelated to sensorimotor processing (pain threshold and basal tone reaction) and innate fear (light-dark test).

By contrast, during the major part of the step, the ankle was less extended than CON. Possible origins of the changes are discussed. This leads to the question of how important is sensory input in the regulation of the locomotor pattern after HU. Data obtained in REC animals showed that 1 week of recovery allowed the restoration of a good locomotor performance. However, the limb motion remained abnormal, and at contrary to HU rats: higher extension during the step, except at push-off when the limb was in hyperflexion.

This nucleus is particularly rich in cholinergic receptors and is a putative target for the development of cholinomimetic cognitive enhancing drugs. Several studies have examined the direct effects of intraseptal cholinomimetic treatments and the results have been somewhat conflicting with both promnestic and amnestic effects. Several variables (e.g., age, task difficulty, timing of drug administration) may influence treatment outcome.","conclusion":"Tacrine infusions did not significantly affect the number of correct choices in the first eight entries, or the number of correct choices until an error. This treatment did not alter the angle of arm entries, or impair the animals' ability to complete the task (enter all baited arms). However, tacrine produced a linear dose-dependent increase in errors, doubling (12.5 microg) and tripling (25.0 microg) the number of errors made before rats completed the task.

Several lines of evidence indicate that these abnormal repetitive behaviors may be expressed as a consequence of imbalanced activity along the direct and indirect processing pathways of the basal ganglia.

Moreover, analyses revealed a significant negative correlation between striatal enkephalin content and frequency of stereotypy as well as a significant positive correlation between the dynorphin\/enkephalin content ratio and frequency of stereotypy in these mice. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that spontaneous stereotypic behavior is expressed as a consequence of relative hyperactivity along cortico-basal ganglia-cortical feedback circuits involving the direct (facilitative) pathway, but suggest that primary perturbations to the indirect (inhibitory) pathway give rise to such imbalanced activity."},{"method":"The sleep was decreased after the lesion of the mPOA, but there was recovery when the rats were given freedom to stay in an ambient temperature (T(amb)) which they preferred.","background":"Changes in sleep-wakefulness (S-W) were studied in adult male Wistar rats, along with body temperature (T(b)), locomotor activity (LMA) and thermal preference, after the lesion of the medial preoptic area (mPOA) with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA).","conclusion":"When given a choice between three T(amb) (24, 27 and 30 degrees C), the rats preferred 27 degrees C before the mPOA lesion, and 24 degrees C during the initial days after the lesion. There was a shift in the thermal preference to 30 degrees C, on the fourth week after the lesion, which coincided with the considerable recovery of sleep. The preference for higher T(amb) probably helped to improve sleep, as T(amb) of 30 degrees C is known to promote sleep. When the lesioned rats were not given the freedom to select the T(amb), there was no recovery in sleep. The mPOA seems to be essential for increasing the durations of slow wave sleep (SWS) episodes, especially the light SWS (S1), as they remained shorter than the pre-lesion value, even when the rats were given freedom to stay in a preferred T(amb). The homeostatic recovery of sleep, especially the night time sleep, resulted in the disruption of circadian sleep rhythm. But, the LMA, T(b) and thermal preference maintained their diurnal variation.

In adulthood, rats that were unrelated and unfamiliar but of the same treatment group were introduced in pairs to an open field for a 30-min test. Social behaviour in home base and exploration modes was assessed using algorithmic analysis of the XY locations of the two rats.","background":"Behavioural abnormalities in adulthood may have their origin in a disturbed interaction with the environment during postnatal development.","conclusion":"Findings revealed that Cold-ED induced a preference for a separate home base, which limited significantly the episodes of social interactions, in comparison to NH. Warm-ED had no comparable effect on the rats' social behaviour. These findings indicate that ED under ambient conditions that constitute severe thermal stress for rat pups leads to development of reduced social motivation in adulthood."},{"method":"We examined the role of adenosine receptors in the ginsenoside-induced changes in hyperlocomotion and conditioned place preference (CPP) in mice that occurred in response to administration of MA (2 mg\/kg, i.p. x 1 or 2 mg\/kg, i.p. x 6). Changes in circling behavior paralleled changes in CPP in the presence of MA. Pre-treatment with ginsenosides (50 or 150 mg\/kg, i.p.) attenuated the MA-induced circling behavior and CPP. This attenuation was reversed by the adenosine A2A receptor antagonist 1,3,7-trimethyl-8-(3-chrostyryl)xanthine (CSC; 0.5 and 1.0 mg\/kg) in a dose-dependent manner, but neither the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine (CPT; 0.5 and 1.0 mg\/kg) nor the A2B receptor antagonist alloxazine (ALX; 1.5 and 3.0 mg\/kg) had any such effect. MA-induced increases in activator protein (AP)-1 DNA binding activity, Fos-related antigen immunoreactivity (FRA-IR), proenkephalin mRNA expression, and proenkephalin-like immunoreactivity were reduced consistently in the striatum of animals that were pretreated with ginsenosides.","background":"Current evidence suggests that ginsenosides inhibit methamphetamine (MA)-induced changes in behavior, but the precise mechanisms that underlie this effect are yet to be determined.","conclusion":"These reductions were largely prevented by CSC, but not by CPT or ALX. Our results suggest that the stimulation of A2A receptors by ginsenosides attenuates the changes in behavior and the increases in AP-1 DNA binding activity, FRA-IR, and proenkephalin gene expression in mouse striatum that are induced by MA."},{"method":"Tests of open-field locomotor activity, hindlimb gait, catalepsy, neuromuscular strength and negative geotaxis were administered to MPS-IIIA and normal male and female mice aged from 3 to 40 weeks of age.","background":"Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type IIIA or Sanfilippo syndrome is a lysosomal storage disorder characterised by progressive neurological pathology. Patients exhibit aggression, disturbed sleep, hyperactivity and mental decline ultimately resulting in inanition and death. Recently, a mouse model of MPS-IIIA was discovered, and both the clinical signs and neuropathological changes mimic the human disease. This provides us with an opportunity to study the pathological progression of this disorder and to determine the efficacy of novel therapies, for at present all lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) affecting the brain are untreatable. Neuropathological changes have previously been described in areas of the brain involved in regulating motor function, therefore, in the present study we sought to determine whether quantifiable motor abnormalities were present in the MPS-IIIA mouse, and if so, at what age they became detectable.","conclusion":"Significant changes in open-field activity were observed from 3 weeks in MPS-IIIA mice, whereas abnormalities in tests of gait, grip strength and in the assessment of the negative geotaxis response were observable from approximately 15 weeks of age. Behavioural changes were often detected in male MPS-IIIA mice before they appeared in females. Our observations provide insight into the chronology of pathological changes within the MPS-IIIA brain and this simple series of tests will prove useful in comparing mice following the administration of experimental therapies for this condition."},{"method":"The present study investigates the relationships between locomotor responses to novelty, cocaine-induced locomotor stimulation and conditioned place preference in C57BL\/6J mice with multiple regression analyses. Four groups of mice receiving saline, 4, 8 or 12 mg\/kg cocaine (i.p.) were submitted to an 8-day unbiased counterbalanced place conditioning protocol. Levels of locomotion on the pre-conditioning session were used as a score of locomotor response to a novel environment. The locomotor activity on the first cocaine-pairing session of the conditioning procedure served as a measure of the locomotion-activating response to a single injection of cocaine.","background":"It has been speculated that an individual's response to novelty is a reliable predictor of its vulnerability to develop addiction. However, the relationships between response to novelty and the development of drug-induced conditioned place preference are still unclear.","conclusion":"Cocaine-induced dose-dependent locomotor stimulant effects and a significant place preference at all tested doses. A positive correlation was found between the locomotor responses to novelty and the locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine, but was significant only for the highest dose of cocaine (12 mg\/kg). In contrast, there was a negative correlation between the locomotor response to novelty and the conditioned place preference induced by 4 mg\/kg cocaine. Finally, the locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine do not correlate with cocaine-induced conditioned place preference at any tested dose of cocaine. The relationships between locomotor response to novelty and both cocaine-induced stimulant and rewarding effects can be differentially affected by the dose in inbred C57BL\/6J mice."},{"method":"The authors, therefore, investigated prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response in APD and schizophrenia in relation to a history of serious violence. The neural substrates of PPI, especially the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and basal ganglia, are implicated in violence as well as in APD and schizophrenia. The study included four groups: (i) patients with APD and a history of violence, (ii) patients with schizophrenia and a history of violence, (iii) patients with schizophrenia without a history of violence, and (iv) healthy subjects with no history of violence or a mental disorder. All subjects were assessed identically on acoustic PPI.","background":"Violent behaviour has a strong association with antisocial personality disorder (APD) and schizophrenia. Although developments in the understanding of socio-environmental factors associated with violence should not be ignored, advances in prevention and treatment of violent behaviour would benefit by improved understanding of its neurobiological and cognitive basis.","conclusion":"Compared to healthy subjects, significantly reduced PPI occurred in APD, violent schizophrenia and non-violent schizophrenia patients. Although PPI did not significantly differentiate the three clinical groups, high ratings of violence were modestly associated with reduced PPI across the entire study sample. Violent patients with impulsive and premeditated violence showed comparable PPI. The association between violent behaviour and impaired PPI suggests that neural structures and functions underlying PPI are implicated in (inhibition of) violence."},{"method":"The present study applied whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural correlates of cognitive inhibition using a novel task, requiring detection of numbers decreasing in numerical order, in relation to sex. The study involved 19 young healthy subjects (9 men, 10 women).","background":"Men are hypothesised to perform better than women at tasks requiring cognitive inhibition.","conclusion":"Behavioural sex differences favouring men were found on the inhibition, but not on the automatization (i.e. detection of numbers increasing in numerical order), condition of the task. Significant areas of activation associated with cognitive inhibition included the right inferior prefrontal and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, left inferior and superior parietal lobes, and bilateral temporal regions across men and women. No brain region was significantly differently activated in men and women. Our findings demonstrate that (a) cognitive inhibition is dependent on intact processes within frontal and parietal regions, and (b) women show inferior cognitive inhibition despite of comparable activation to men in relevant regions. Equated behavioural performance may elicit sex differences in brain activation."},{"method":"We found that the condition of subordination enhances the level of NGF in the subventricular zone and hippocampus whereas dominance elevates brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). It was also found that mRNA-TrkA is over-expressed in the subventricular zone and hippocampus of dominant and subordinate mice, whereas mRNA-TrkB is increased in the subventricular zone of both dominants and subordinates and in the hippocampus of dominant mice. Fighting was also associated with increased presence of proliferating cells in the hippocampus stained with the nuclear marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Moreover, the brain of subordinate mice displayed tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in the wall of the periventricular region of the third ventricles and a marked neuropeptide Y (NPY) presence in the hippocampus co-expressed with BrdU.","background":"In the present study, we investigate the effect of aggressive behavior and release of nerve growth factor (NGF) on brain progenitor cells.","conclusion":"These results provide additional evidence that agonistic behavior in the aged mouse alters neurotrophin levels and increases brain progenitor cells number.

Drug treatment was started 7 days before focal cortical photothrombosis (Rose Bengal, 20 mg\/kg) and continued for 28 days thereafter. Sensorimotor recovery was assessed by a new beam-walking test and spatial learning by the Morris water-maze before cortical stroke, immediately after stroke, and at the end of follow-up. Infarct volumes were measured from nitroblue tetrazolium-stained sections at the end of follow-up.","background":"Psychotropic drugs are commonly used in the elderly, including those who may sustain ischemic attacks. Concomitant CNS medication may interfere with functional recovery. The present study evaluated the effect of risperidone, an atypical neuroleptic, and fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on histological and functional outcome after experimental stroke in aged rats, which might be more vulnerable to brain insults.","conclusion":"The high slip ratio for the contralateral hindlimb in ischemic rats treated with risperidone indicated sensorimotor impairment when tested 2 h after drug administration. Sensorimotor impairment was not observed, however, when the rats were tested 24 h after risperidone administration. Similarly, water-maze performance was impaired 2 h after risperidone. Fluoxetine did not affect sensorimotor or water-maze performance. Cortical infarct volumes were not different in ischemic controls and ischemic rats treated with antipsychotic drugs. The present study showed that an atypical neuroleptic, risperidone, acutely impairs behavioral performance, but does not affect histological or functional outcome in aged rats subjected to cortical photothrombosis."},{"method":"The aim of the present study was to give a detailed comparative behavioral analysis of young and aging male and female rats following 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion of the substantia nigra. Young males and females, as well as aging males and females underwent 6-OHDA-induced lesion of the substantia nigra. Behavioral analysis in an open-field was performed before the injury, and 1 and 10 days after the operation. Tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry was done in order to assess the dopaminergic cell loss in the substantia nigra.","background":"It is well known that Parkinson's disease occurs more commonly in older people and men are more frequently affected than women. Animal studies in models of the disease mainly use young male animals. The effects of aging on the neurochemical changes in the dopaminergic system have been extensively studied, however, data on comparative behavioral consequences of lesions of the dopaminergic system in aging and in female animals are limited.","conclusion":"It was found that both young and aging male animals were more susceptible to 6-OHDA than females: female rats had a significantly less dopaminergic cell loss and responded to 6-OHDA with a significantly higher degree of behavioral recovery after the injury. Although the dopaminergic cell loss was not significantly different between young and aging animals of the same sex, aging rats showed more severe behavioral deficits. In summary, our present results showed clear age- and gender differences in the behavioral and histological outcome following 6-OHDA lesion of the substantia nigra."},{"method":"Thus, counts of all behaviours emitted during FST in rats (four-month-old Wistar male, n = 63) were recorded and examined by Markovian sequential analysis (MSA) and principal components analysis (PCA). In a second experiment, rats (n = 28) were tested in an open field test (OFT) followed a week later by FST; behaviours in both tests were recorded and analysed by two correlation methods (Pearson's test and sliding window correlation).","background":"Forced swimming test (FST) or 'behavioural despair' test is a useful screening for antidepressant drugs. The FST predictability has been improved by a number of procedural modifications. Description of the behavioural microstructure in FST may help to delineate innovative protocols.","conclusion":"The descriptive ethological analysis displayed counts of swimming and immobility increased over the course of the test, whereas climbing behaviour decreased. The MSA revealed the occurrence of immobility was predicted by swimming, climbing, and diving behaviours whereas the immobility predicted the occurrence of swimming behaviour and headshakes. The PCA showed duration of immobility and climbing loaded into one component and duration of immobility and swimming loaded into another one. Low as well high levels of climbing behaviour were positively correlated with motor activity in the OFT. In brief, the present data suggest there are at least two different factors that grouped variables related to the behavioural despair in the FST. In addition, altered motor activity could be predicted by the frequency of climbing behaviour recorded in the FST."},{"method":"Here we found ERK-like and JNK-like cross-immunoreactivity in the crab brain with phospho-specific antibodies and we estimated ERK and JNK activity during long-term memory consolidation in the context-signal learning paradigm of the crab Chasmagnathus. At 0, 1, 3 and 6h after training ERK and JNK activity was measured. ERK-like activation was found 1h after spaced training in cytosolic but not in nuclear fractions of brain homogenates, while JNK activity remained unchanged in both fractions. Passive (context exposure) and active (continuous stimulation) controls showed cytosolic ERK and JNK activation immediately after training, which decayed 1h later.","background":"It was previously demonstrated that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling plays a pivotal role in neural plasticity and memory processes both in rodents and mollusks. Although the MAPK pathways are highly conserved, no evidence was found for its participation in memory models in other animal groups.","conclusion":"In coincidence with this time course of activity, an ERK1\/2 pathway inhibitor, PD098059, induced amnesia only when administered 45 min after training but not when administered immediately pre- or post-training. These data support that: (1) cytoplasmic but not nuclear ERK substrates must be differentially phosphorylated during memory consolidation, and (2) ERK phosphorylation and consequent activation 1h after training is necessary for long-term memory consolidation in this arthropod model."},{"method":"Three groups of animals received Pilo (300 mg\/kg, i.p.), at 3 months of age, and the animals that did not show Status epilepticus were submitted to the water maze task 1 or 21 months after or once a month from the 4th to 24th month of age.","background":"The cholinergic pathways are intimately involved in the learning and memory process and disruption of this system produces impairments in many learning and memory models. Converging lines of evidence support the idea that there is an age-related decline in learning and memory in animals and this decline is strikingly similar to memory changes that occur when the cholinergic system is compromised. The purpose of this work was to evaluate whether a single administration of the muscarinic receptor agonist Pilocarpine (Pilo) could prevent the age-related learning impairment in rats.","conclusion":"The results showed that Pilo did not interfere with learning abilities 1-month after treatment nor in animals that were submitted to the test once a month. In addition, the animals treated with Pilo and submitted to the task 21 month after performed as well as control young rats in the training and in the testing sessions, while a marked learning impairment was detected in control old rats. These results indicate that a single administration of Pilo might prevent the age-related learning impairments in rats on a spatial task in the water maze."},{"method":"We show here that the pattern of tau phosphorylation correlates with the decline of memory retention ability in rat brain. In our study, we have chosen 55 rats of full age to conduct the discrimination between their normal and low ability of memory retention in one-trial step-down test. It was found that among rats that developed the impairment in memory retention in step-down inhibitory avoidance task, tau protein in their hippocampus was hyperphosohorylated at Thr231\/Ser235 (M4) sites of tau, and the significantly increased expression of PP-1 and the decreased one of PP-2B were also determined by Western blot and\/or immunohistochemistry.","background":"Microtubule associated protein tau is abnormally phosphorylated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aggregates as paired helical filaments (PHFs) in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are one of the pathological signatures of AD and their presence correlates with severity of dementia. Dysfunction of protein phosphatases in the effected neurons is proposed to be a possible causative factor to AD development.","conclusion":"It is implicated that: (1) the hyperphosphorylation of tau at M4 sites may be crucial to affect the memory retention of elder rats; (2) PP-1 might participate in the regulation of phosphorylation at Thr231 and Ser235 epitope of tau in vivo, and the up-regulation of PP-1 content could be in relation to tau hyperphosphorylation at Thr231\/Ser235 sites of brain tau and the worse memory retention of rats indirectly; and (3) the decline of PP-2B content could induced the hyperphosphorylation of tau at M4 sides in vivo."},{"method":"After three learning sessions, control mice reached a high percentage of correct responses. They consistently made the olfactory-reward associations, but antero-dorsal and postero-ventral hippocampal-lesioned mice did not. However, all lesioned mice learned the paradigm and the timing of the task as fast and as well as control mice.","background":"A new apparatus, the olfactory tubing maze for mice, was developed recently to study learning and memory processes in mice in regard to their ethological abilities. As in humans, BALB\/c mice with selective bilateral lesions of the hippocampal formation showed selective impairment of subcategories of long-term memory when tested with the olfactory tubing maze.","conclusion":"These data suggest that the olfactory tubing maze can be used to study subcategories of memory, such as declarative and non-declarative memory, which are similar in some respects to those observed in humans. Consequently, possible memory effects of classical approaches (i.e., pharmacological or lesion studies) or genetic modifications in transgenic or gene-targeting mice can be effectively analyzed using this new apparatus."},{"method":"To further map, the brain regions involved in the expression of the feeding-anticipatory behavior, we quantified the expression of Fos in hypothalamic areas involved in arousal.","background":"When food is available during a restricted and predictable time of the day, animals show increased locomotor and food searching behaviors before the anticipated daily meal. We had shown that histamine-containing neurons are the only aminergic neurons related to arousal that become active in anticipation of an upcoming meal.","conclusion":"We found that nearly 35% of the histamine neurons from the tuberomammillary nucleus were Fos-immunoreactive immediately before mealtime. One hour before this transient increase in Fos-immunoreactivity, we found a similarly brief increase of fos mRNA in the tuberomammillary nucleus. In contrast, the activation of two types of perifornical hypothalamic neurons followed meal onset by 1-2 h. One neuron type was orexin\/hypocretin-immunoreactive, while the other type was neither orexin nor melanin concentrating hormone-immunoreactive. The present work indicates that the increased locomotor activity that anticipates mealtime coincides with the activation of the tuberomammillary nucleus, and that the behavioral activation during the consummatory phase of feeding coincides more closely with the delayed activation of the perifornical hypothalamic area."},{"method":"We tested the effects of the non-selective antagonist flumazenil (0-20.0 mg\/kg), the preferential alpha1-subunit selective antagonist beta-carboline-3-carboxylate-t-butyl ester (beta-CCt) (0-30.0 mg\/kg), the non-selective agonist midazolam (0-2.0 mg\/kg), the preferential alpha1-subunit selective agonist zolpidem (0-3.0 mg\/kg), and the non-selective inverse agonist methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) (0-2.0 mg\/kg) in the one-trial step-through passive avoidance task in rats. The compounds were administered intraperitoneally, before the acquisition test.","background":"Recent research on genetically modified mice has attributed the amnesic effect of benzodiazepines mainly to the alpha1-containing GABA(A) receptor subtypes. The pharmacological approach, using subtype selective ligands, is needed to complement genetic studies.","conclusion":"Flumazenil and beta-CCt did not affect retention performance. Midazolam and zolpidem induced amnesia in a dose-dependent manner. The complete reversal of amnesia was unattainable. The effects of zolpidem were significantly attenuated by the both, flumazenil (10.0 mg\/kg) and beta-CCt (30.0 mg\/kg); by contrast, only flumazenil was considerably effective when combined with midazolam. DMCM exerted promnesic effects at 0.2mg\/kg, in an inverted U-shape manner. Both antagonists tended to abolish this action. The results indicate that some other alpha-subunit(s), in addition to the alpha1-subunit, contribute to the amnesic actions of non-selective benzodiazepine site agonists in the passive avoidance task. On the other hand, a significant part of the DMCM-induced promnesic effect could involve the alpha1-subunit and\/or other putative beta-CCt-sensitive binding site(s)."},{"method":"We induced prenatal stress by exposing gestating dams to a daily constraint stress during the last week of pregnancy. We tested the rats for LI of conditioned taste aversion by exposing them to sucrose for 3 days prior to conditioning.","background":"The present experiment was designed to examine the effects of prenatal stress and gender in latent inhibition. Prenatal stress has been proposed as a risk factor both for depression and for schizophrenia, and both of these syndromes are associated with alterations in the functional state of the dopamine system. There is also some evidence that prenatal stress can produce changes in dopamine activity, although the details of the stress-induced changes are a matter of debate. Latent inhibition (LI), which is strongly dependent on dopaminergic activity, consists in delayed Pavlovian conditioning about a stimulus that previously signalled no consequence.","conclusion":"Irrespective of stress or gender, latent inhibition was observed but the degree of LI varied as a function of both prenatal stress and gender. Unstressed males showed less LI than unstressed females, but prenatal stress increased the amount of LI only in the males. These results are inconsistent with the use of prenatal stress as an animal model for schizophrenia. A model is proposed that accounts for the relationships between gender, dopamine function, cognitive changes and psychiatric pathology."},{"method":"Male Swiss mice were acutely administered HG1 at active doses in association with GABA antagonists such as flumazenil, bicuculline and picrotoxine, then, with 5-HT1A (NAN 190, WAY 100635) and 5-HT1B receptor antagonist (methiothepine).

In a pilot study, HG1 has demonstrated an anxiolytic-like profile in three mouse models of anxiety (elevated plus maze, light\/dark, four plates). The aim of our study was to examine the mechanism of the anxiolytic-like effects of HG1 in the mouse elevated plus maze.","conclusion":"Regarding GABA antagonists, only flumazenil antagonised active doses of HG1 in an incomplete manner. Moreover, non-active doses of HG1 were potentiated by low doses of WAY 100635 and by anpirtoline but not by 8-OHDPAT. Finally, the anxiolytic-like effects of HG1 at active doses were antagonised by all serotonergic antagonists (WAY 100635 at higher dose, NAN 190 and methiothepin). HG1 mechanism of action in the mouse elevated plus maze seems to associate a GABA-ergic component exerting a limited regulation of 5-HT neuronal activity and a major serotonergic component, which seems to implicate presynaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors."},{"method":"We investigated in 75 healthy volunteers (37 right-handed, 38 left-handed) if language and spatial attention may associate not only in individuals with an atypical pattern of language lateralization, but also in subjects showing the standard, i.e. left-hemispheric dominance for language.

Sexual dysfunction is a prominent symptom in depression and in the present study we investigated the effects of maternal separation on copulatory behaviour and partner preference in adult male rats and paced mating in adult female rats. It has been suggested that corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) inhibits copulatory behaviour in male rats and we therefore examined if changes in male sexual behaviour were accompanied by changes in hypothalamic corticotropin releasing factor protein content.","conclusion":"Ejaculation latency was not affected and there were no changes in partner preference in male rats. Paced mating behaviour of adult maternally separated female rats was unaffected. The concentration of corticotropin releasing factor-like immunoreactivity was lower in the hypothalamus of male rats separated for 180 min compared to male handled rats. We therefore suggest that 180 min of maternal separation generates a male phenotype with increased sexual motivation possibly due to inadequate levels of corticotropin releasing factor in the hypothalamus."},{"method":"A potential isoform-dependent effect of h-apoE on cognitive performance was studied in gene-targeted mice, which show physiological expression levels and distribution of h-apoE3 or h-apoE4.

Female h-apoE3 mice failed to improve their performance during training in a reference memory version of the spatial water-maze task, but performed well during the probe trial 24 h after the last training trial. Memory retention performances of h-apoE4 mice were impaired during this probe trial. Both h-apoE3 and h-apoE4 mice did not improve their performance in a water-maze delayed matching to place task. Finally, h-apoE3 mice showed mild perturbations in a Y-maze active avoidance task, whereas both h-apoE mouse lines performed well in a passive avoidance task. Thus, spatial memory performances appeared particularly sensitive to h-apoE-isoform-dependent effects. Deficits occurred predominantly in female h-apoE4 mice, which support the hypothesis that humans carrying h-apoE4, especially women, have impaired spatial memory compared to those carrying h-apoE3."},{"method":"To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of these conditions, we used the kainic acid (KA) model of neuronal injury. Systemically-administered KA induces excitotoxicity by overstimulation of glutamate receptors, resulting in neuronal death by necrosis and apoptosis.","background":"Previous studies have suggested that exercise in a running wheel can be neuroprotective, perhaps due to, among others, gene-expression changes after exercise, increases in trophic proteins and\/or enhanced cardiovascular responsivity.

However, prior exercise did not decrease to control levels the hyperactivity normally seen in KA-treated animals, as measured by ambulation in the open field. Furthermore, both exercise and enriched environment did not protect against neuron loss in CA1, CA2 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus, despite a substantial increase in brain-derived neutrophic factor (BDNF) levels in dentate gyrus of the exercise and KA-treated animals."},{"method":"In this study, we compared the characteristics of exploration in a dark arena with exploration by the same individuals in a lit arena.","background":"The behavior of Tristram's jird (a species of gerbil) in an illuminated open field resembled that of other rodents, comprising round trips to a home base and alternating between periods of progression (locomoting) and of stopping.","conclusion":"In the dark arena, stopping episodes were brief and fewer, suggesting almost continuous locomotion by the rodents. The clear distinction between progression and stopping that had characterized locomotion in an illuminated arena, thus diminished in the dark. There was also no apparent home base in the dark and traveling consisted in moving in a circular path, closing a loop to a recently traveled place that varied from one loop to the next. Locomotion in the dark may thus be regarded as a set of loops (round trips) to a continuously shifting home base, whereas with lights on the round trips converge to a home base using visible environmental landmarks. We suggest that a similar looping mechanism may be applicable to the behavior of hippocampal rats displaying hyperactivity and diversified locomotion, reminiscent of that seen in jirds in a dark arena."},{"method":"Adult male mice (55 normal and 29 acallosal) of the BALB\/cCF strain were initially tested (twice; inter-test interval: 72 h) in an unbiased setup in which both forepaws could easily perform a reaching movement.

In the biased setup, left- and right-pawed normal mice were equally consistent (approximately 65% of the animals, in both groups, used the preferred paw of the initial two tests, in spite of the bias). Conversely, while left-pawed acallosal mice were as consistent (65%) as normal mice, only 20% of right-pawed mice were consistent.

The increase in the left eye use, to view a stranger may be associated with the role of the left eye in comparing the features of a strange conspecific. In the second experiment, lateralisation of viewing visual stimuli that could evoke different levels of motivation to biologically relevant stimuli was tested.

Thus, colouration of males evoking different levels motivation can be used to measure lateralisation in guppies."},{"method":"In this study, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) or 2,5-anhydro-d-mannitol (2,5-AM) were used to attenuate the circadian shift from lipid to carbohydrate metabolism, which normally occurs at the onset of the light phase in free-feeding, singly housed zebra finches, in order to evaluate the possibility that carbohydrate metabolism influences the production of undirected song. Food intake was also measured.","background":"Previous findings in our laboratory indicate that food availability and\/or the balance of metabolic fuels may play a role in the production of undirected song in singly housed adult male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata).","conclusion":"Both drugs (which block carbohydrate metabolism and increase reliance on lipid metabolism) produced dose-dependent reductions in undirected singing, while food intake was not altered. Our results suggest that undirected singing (and possibly other voluntary and\/or social behaviors) is sensitive to the availability of dietary fuels, whereas, food intake may show a greater regulation by the availability of stored fuels."},{"method":"Male Wistar rats were assigned to freely explore either of three EPM configuration, with the enclosed arm walls constructed with either translucent glass (O\/E(DeltaLux)=11), opaque glass (O\/E(DeltaLux)=96) or wood (O\/E(DeltaLux)=141), for 2 consecutive days (trial 1\/trial 2).","background":"The effect of the gradient of luminosity between the open and the enclosed arms (O\/E(DeltaLux)) of the elevated plus maze (EPM), upon the level of fear\/anxiety in rats submitted to the trial 1\/trial 2 paradigm was investigated.","conclusion":"Independently of the EPM configuration, rats exhibited increased fear during trial 2 relative to trial 1, thus indicating that the level of O\/E(DeltaLux), at least in the range used here, is not a determinant variable for the establishment of increased anxiety induced by prior maze experience. The groups tested under 11 and 141 O\/E(DeltaLux) were those who exhibited the low and higher level of open arm avoidance, respectively. There was also an increased open arms avoidance over trial 1 in rats tested under 11 and 96 O\/E(DeltaLux), only. These results suggest that the enclosed arm preference of rats during trial 1 EPM procedure may be changed by the level of O\/E(DeltaLux) of the test. The present results are discussed with respect to the controversy regarding the role of luminosity on EPM performance."},{"method":"Right BLA kindling of high baseline anxiety rats was anxiolytic one week after kindling. Right BLA kindling of low baseline anxiety rats was anxiogenic. In addition, left BLA kindling was either anxiogenic or without effect on plus maze anxiety, depending on baseline anxiety.","background":"Effects of kindling of right and left basolateral amygdala (BLA) on plus maze anxiety was studied. Using a validated retest paradigm, it was possible to retest rats in the plus maze without increasing anxiety on retest. This permitted determining prekindling baseline levels of plus maze anxiety.","conclusion":"Effects in left BLA differ from previous work showing anxiolytic effects of left BLA kindling. The discrepancy could be explained in part by prekindling baseline anxiety. These findings require modification of the previous conclusion that left hemisphere (left BLA) kindling is anxiolytic and right BLA kindling is anxiogenic in the plus maze. Rather the hemisphere difference may be due to an interaction between baseline anxiety level and kindling. If true, anxious disposition in rodents may interact with amygdala kindling to change amygdala function differently. Kindling and baseline anxiety effects on other behaviors (such as risk assessment and resistance to capture) are also described. Present data in the light of past studies suggest both premorbid anxiety state and location of the kindling electrode contribute to the effects of kindling on behavior."},{"method":"In the present study, we sought to determine if REMSD was associated with a change in response to noxious heat (i.e., altered nociceptive sensitivity). Two groups of rats, aged 6 and 22 months, were subjected to hotplate algesia testing at two different temperatures (44 and 52 degrees C). Initially, baseline numbers of responses and total response time were obtained at 44 degrees C. Animals then were exposed to 48 h of REMSD or control conditions.","background":"REM sleep deprivation (REMSD) has been shown to increase rates of negatively reinforced operant behavior, but not operant responding maintained by positive reinforcement. The reason for this differential effect is currently unknown. We hypothesize that REMSD can increase sensitivity to noxious stimuli.","conclusion":"The frequency and duration of hindpaw responses (licking and guarding) increased for young animals only after REMSD and none of the control conditions. Old rats showed increased duration of nocifensive responding after REMSD and tank control conditions without a change in the number of responses at 44 degrees C. Latency to first nocifensive response was significantly longer in the 44 degrees C hotplate tests, but decreased to levels observed throughout the 52 degrees C hotplate tests following REMSD and TC conditions. These findings suggest that REMSD increases nociceptive sensitivity under conditions of sustained, selective C nociceptor activation (42 degrees C), but not under conditions of phasic A-delta activation (52 degrees C). The findings also indicate that age can be a significant variable in REMSD studies."},{"method":"Chicks were trained on a strongly-reinforced single-trial passive avoidance task involving discrimination between two coloured beads. Intracerebral administration of the protein synthesis blocker, anisomycin, revealed that a phase of memory formation sensitive to arousal levels was extended by approximately 35 min following exposure to the complex rhythm stimulus. Administration of 2,4-dinitrophenol showed that this extension occurred during phase B of intermediate-term memory. Finally, a higher dose of the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol, was required to inhibit long-term memory in the presence of the auditory stimulus than in its absence.","background":"Previous research in our laboratory has demonstrated a significant memory-enhancing effect of exposure to a complex rhythm stimulus following weakly-reinforced passive avoidance learning in chicks. The aim of this study was to explore whether noradrenaline mediates this process.","conclusion":"These findings suggest that the memory-enhancing effects of the complex rhythm stimulus may be mediated by noradrenaline, possibly via an increase in physiological arousal."},{"method":"In the present study, Korsakoff patients and a group of age-matched controls learned a new bimanual motor skill whereby performance was assessed in the presence and absence of augmented visual information feedback.","background":"Within the field of cognitive neuroscience, it has become widely accepted to distinguish between declarative and nondeclarative memory, with different neurobiological substrates subserving these memory structures. This distinction has been inferred from the study of amnesic patients, including those suffering from Korsakoff's syndrome. It is commonly agreed that Korsakoff patients demonstrate intact memory for motor and perceptual skills (nondeclarative) whereas memory of various forms of factual knowledge (declarative) is severely impaired.","conclusion":"Findings demonstrated that Korsakoff patients were able to learn and retain this skill when directive augmented information feedback was provided while no learning occurred at all in the absence of this information. These observations shed new light on the conditions required for preserved memory in amnesic patients and challenge the classic view that nondeclarative memory is invariably preserved. Instead, the quality of memory across both motor and cognitive dimensions appears to depend on the availability of task-specific information to guide performance, presumably allowing amnesic patients to bypass affected brain areas. This prompts for a reevaluation of current notions about procedural memory capacity in Korsakoff patients."},{"method":"This study assessed the performance of two unilateral lesion models of PD in a lateralised nose-poking task in the nine-hole box test apparatus. This task assesses the accuracy and speed of movements to either side of a rats' head, as well as a number of errors of performance.","background":"The nigrostriatal degeneration underlying Parkinson's disease (PD) is commonly modeled in experimental animals by injection of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Although a wide variety of simple behavioural screens exist to assess the impact of such dopamine lesions, more complex tasks that assess multiple parameters of an animal's performance may provide a more sensitive measure of the resulting functional impairment.","conclusion":"Rats with complete unilateral dopamine depletion (induced by injection of 6-OHDA into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB)) attempted fewer trials and committed more procedural errors than controls. They developed a marked ipsilateral responding bias, with a reduced accuracy for contralateral stimuli. They were also slower to react to contralateral stimuli and to complete movements bilaterally. Rats with unilateral nigrostriatal terminal lesions (induced by multiple injections of 6-OHDA in the striatum) developed a similar pattern of deficits, but they were significantly less impaired and spontaneously recovered to pre-operative levels by 4 months post-lesion. This experiment confirms that the lateralised nose-poking task may be a powerful tool for assessment of the nature of deficit and recovery in rats with complete but not partial unilateral dopamine lesions."},{"method":"In the current study, female C57BL\/6J mice, either 2 months or 1 year of age, were given 5 days of testing followed by 3 days of rest, and then three additional days of testing. Mice either received a single LPS injection on day 1 and saline on days 2-5, LPS injections on days 1-5, or saline injections on days 1-5.","background":"Several studies have shown that systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) may affect performance in various learning tasks, including the Morris water maze.","conclusion":"Daily LPS administration significantly prolonged latency for the animals to find the platform, and decreased their swimming speed. Year-old mice treated with LPS each day also exhibited significantly higher levels of thigmotaxis in the maze. Despite effects on latency and swim speed, no effect of LPS treatment was observed for distance traveled to the platform or other measures that clearly indicate disruption of learning in the maze. On the other hand, age was a significant factor affecting both latency and distance, with older animals swimming greater distances to find the platform. Additionally, older animals were more adversely affected by daily LPS treatment. In this study, although LPS-induced performance impairments in the Morris water maze were noted, particularly in older animals, these effects were not clearly indicative of learning impairment per se."},{"method":"Rats that received nicotine (0.42 mg\/kg base) immediately before placement in an environment for 30 min on eight separate occasions displayed hyperactivity relative to controls in a subsequent injection\/drug-free test. This conditioned hyperactivity was weaker if nicotine was administered 15 min before environment exposure. Conditioning was not evidenced when nicotine was administered 15 min after placement or upon removal from the environment. In a follow-up experiment, rats received 45 min in the environment; nicotine was administered 15 min after placement.","background":"Using a locomotor conditioning preparation, we examined whether manipulating time between exposure to distinct environmental cues and nicotine administration affected conditioned responding.","conclusion":"This group showed conditioning that was localized to the last two-thirds of a 45 min test indicating that a 15 min delay did not prevent conditioning given 30 min of environment\/nicotine overlap. This apparent timing of conditioned responding was not due to increasing environment exposure to 45 min. Further, a state-dependent environmental familiarization account of locomotor hyperactivity during testing was eliminated by the finding that rats displayed temporally specific increases in activity on the test day despite the fact that the context was previously experienced without drug for 15 min on eight consecutive days."},{"method":"We tested the effect of NMDA-receptor blockade on the performance of rats in Active Allothetic Place Avoidance (AAPA), a cognitive task which requires rats to separate two conflicting spatial reference frames (room and arena frames), when only the room frame is relevant for solution of the task. The NMDA-receptor blockade was achieved by systemic administration of either 0.15 mg\/kg or 0.2 mg\/kg of dizocilpine (MK-801), a non-competitive NMDA-receptor antagonist. Two distinct AAPA setups located in different rooms were used. The rooms had different layouts of robust extramaze landmarks. Intact rats were trained in the upstairs arena and, subsequently, they received saline or MK-801 and their performance was tested (reinforced retention). Re-acquisition of AAPA task in the downstairs room was then tested under saline or MK-801.","background":"Spatial orientation is considered to be an animal model of human cognitive functions. Efficient navigation is believed to require a brain representation of the environment. The role of NMDA-receptor-dependent neurotransmission in encoding spatial representations has been intensively studied; however, its involvement in organizing spatial information into neural representations is poorly understood.","conclusion":"MK-801 at the dose of 0.2 mg\/kg was found to disrupt the reinforced retention of the AAPA. Re-acquisition of AAPA in the novel environment was impaired by both doses of MK-801. Taken together, administration of MK-801 causes an orientation deficit in the AAPA task irrespectively of the rats' prior intact pretraining.

D1 receptor densities (B(max)) and D2 receptor affinity (K(d)) were also significantly lower in the caudate nucleus brain region of stereotypy horses (P&lt;0.05). No other significant results were observed. These results demonstrate that stereotypy horses have increased activity within the mesoaccumbens dopamine pathway and, thus, that the development of environmentally-induced stereotypy may be associated with changes in motivational systems within the animal."},{"method":"Participants were 112 undergraduate students (42 males and 70 females).","background":"The present study characterized frequent motion patterns (search strategies) that occurred during spatial navigation in a virtual maze. The research focused on identifying and characterizing some search strategies, the temporal progression of strategy-use, and their role in spatial performance.","conclusion":"We identified three search strategies that predicted spatial performance. Enfilading refers to an approach-withdrawal pattern of active exploration near a target location. Thigmotaxis refers to a search strategy that involves continuous contact with the circular wall of the maze. Visual scan involves active visual exploration while the subject remains in a fixed spatial location and turns round.

The task was to locate one or several unmarked goals using the arena geometry, starting position and\/or cues on the arena wall. Navigation in a real version and a computer map view version of the tests yielded similar results.","background":"Spatial disorientation and learning problems belong to the integral symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD).","conclusion":"The AD group was severely impaired relative to controls in navigation to one hidden goal in eight rotated positions. The impairment was largest when only the cues on the wall could be used for orientation. Also, the AD group recalled worse than controls the order of six sequentially presented locations, though they recalled similarly to controls the positions of the locations. The group with subjective problems was not impaired in any of the tests. Our results document the spatial navigation and non-verbal episodic memory impairment in the AD.

We also compared the performance of SHR and WIS rats in the object recognition test.","background":"Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) exhibit impairment across several cognitive domains such as attention, short-term memory and spatial reference memory. These cognitive deficits have been variously attributed to disrupted dopaminergic, cholinergic and adenosinergic neurotransmitter function. However, social memory in SHR has not been investigated.","conclusion":"SHR exhibited significantly impaired performance in both models of social memory, but not in the object recognition test, demonstrating a selective deficit in the ability to recognize a juvenile rat after a short period of time. The administration of acute doses of the non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine (3.0 or 10.0 mg\/kg, i.p.) and the adenosine A2A receptor antagonist 4-(2-[7-amino-2-[2-furyl][1,2,4]triazolo-[2,3-a][1,3,5]triazin-5-yl-amino]ethyl) phenol (ZM241385, 0.5 or 1.0 mg\/kg, i.p.) but not the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX, 1.0 or 3.0 mg\/kg, i.p.) reversed this social memory impairment in SHR, but these treatments did not alter the hypertension state.

Both the basolateral (BLA) and central (CeN) nuclei of the amygdala are required for conditioned freezing, though there can be recovery with overtraining. The neuroanatomical substrates of conditioned suppression are less clear, with evidence both for a specific requirement of the CeN and for disruption by BLA lesions.","conclusion":"BLA and CeN lesions both abolished all measures of conditioned fear after 9 trials of fear conditioning. However, when conditioning was extended to 33 trials, whereas rats with combined lesions of both the BLA and CeN continued to show no conditioned fear responses, there was a pattern of recovery observed after selective lesions. There was a partial recovery of freezing with both lesions, and full recovery of conditioned suppression, except for off-baseline suppression in CeN lesioned rats. These results indicate that with few conditioning trials, both the BLA and CeN are required in a serial manner for conditioned fear responses, but that overtraining can mitigate such impairments, likely involving parallel pathways in and through the amygdala."},{"method":"The modulation of acute and chronic effects of amitriptyline on inhibitory avoidance in male and female mice by piracetam was investigated.

Immediately after the behavioural task, they received a single injection of the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline (30 mg\/kg) or physiological saline. Twenty-four hours later, subjects were tested for avoidance. In Experiment 2, the same doses of amitriptyline and piracetam were chronically administered. Mice were subjected to the training phase of inhibitory avoidance on the 22nd day, and to the test phase 24 h later. Forty-five minutes after test, subjects explored the elevated plus-maze for 5 min in order to assess whether the effects of amitriptyline on avoidance performance may reflect general behavioural changes.","background":"The purpose of the present work was to study the effects of amitriptyline on animal cognition in relation to some characteristics of its therapeutic effects.","conclusion":"Results obtained were that: (a) acute and chronic amitriptyline impaired inhibitory avoidance of male and female mice, (b) piracetam counteracted the effect of acutely administered amitriptyline on inhibitory avoidance, and (c) piracetam counteracted the effects of chronically administered amitriptyline in males but not females in the same learning task.

Grooming is a complex and essential ritual in the rodent behavioural repertoire with a general cephalocaudal progression (forepaws-nose-face-body-legs-tail and genitals). Various stressors as well as genetic manipulations have been reported to alter mouse grooming and its patterning, underlying the importance of analysis of grooming behaviours. Although strain differences between these mice have been assessed in many studies, no comparative analyses of their grooming have been performed.","conclusion":"Overall, 129S1 mice demonstrated lower grooming activity and impaired microstructure (more interrupted bouts and incorrect transitions contrary to the cephalocaudal rule), accompanied by lower vertical exploration. In contrast, BALB\/c and NMRI mice showed high vertical activity and unimpaired grooming microstructure, also exhibiting different grooming levels (BALB\/c&gt;NMRI). Our study suggests that contrasting grooming phenotypes in these mice may not be due to the strain differences in their sensory abilities, general activity levels, brain anatomy or aggressiveness, but rather reflect a complex interplay between anxiety, motor and displacement activity in these strains (hypoactive anxious phenotype in 129S1 mice, active anxious phenotype in BALB\/c and non-anxious high displacement phenotype in NMRI mice). We suggest that ethological analysis of mouse grooming, such as that reported here, may be a useful tool in neurobehavioural research."},{"method":"In the open field test, both male and female rats that had experienced perinatal hypothyroidism (HT rats) showed an increased percent of locomotion behaviour and reduced grooming behaviour, suggesting that HT rats may be hyperactive and show fewer anxiety characteristics. Neither male nor female HT rats showed retention in the passive avoidance test. Male HT rats showed a significantly lower rate of correct avoidance responses than control rats in earlier sessions in the active avoidance test. In addition, we observed significant increases in the number of times that rats crossed the partition during inter-trial intervals and the percent of failure of avoidance during 5 s electrical stimuli in HT rats, suggesting that HT rats are restless, have a shortened attention span and panic easily.","background":"Thyroid hormone is essential for the proper development of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). In the present study, we examined behavioural alterations caused by transient perinatal hypothyroidism induced by an anti-thyroid drug, propylthiouracil (PTU). This drug produces perinatal disruption of the thyroid system and subsequent behavioural changes, which we investigated using a series of behavioural tests and focusing particularly on attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behaviours.","conclusion":"In measuring spontaneous motor activity during a period of darkness, male HT rats appeared to plunge into active phase with short, quick steps, while male control rats showed only long active phases during a stress-free period of darkness. These abnormal behavioural characteristics in HT rats might coincide with those found in some cases of ADHD."},{"method":"When tested once only in a drug-free state, the expression of place conditioning to all drugs generally strengthened with the passing of time and was only marginally different when tested once more later. The expression of place conditioning was remarkably resistant to extinction during repeated daily testing, though decreases were observed over 2 weeks of testing. Subsequently, a small and non-significant degree of spontaneous recovery of the expression of place conditioning was observed when animals were undisturbed for an extended period of time. Administering animals the same drug to which they were conditioned 20 min prior to testing (i.e. drug state testing), either prior to or following repeated testing, enhanced expression of morphine-induced conditioned place preference, whereas expression of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference was unaffected.

No changes were found in any of the 11 brain regions examined. Since we had previously identified changes in D2 receptor binding after PSD, we next examined the effects of DA receptor subtype antagonists on cocaine-induced reflexes in sleep-deprived rats.","conclusion":"In saline pretreated rats, cocaine-induced penile erection (PE) in 100% of SD rats.

In addition, acute cocaine-induced ejaculation in 80% of SD rats. This effect was not affected by haloperidol at any dose, but was significantly reduced by all doses of SCH 23390 and by the 200 mg\/kg dose of sulpiride. These results suggest that the potentiating effects of cocaine on penile erection and ejaculation are likely due to PSD-induced changes in DA postsynaptic receptor sensitivity rather than alterations in DA transporter.

Disparity vergence response functions varied from (1) appropriate initiation of vergence to both directions of disparity, (2) initiation of vergence to only one direction of disparity, or (3) an attenuated initiation of vergence response to either direction of disparity. Within subjects, their asymmetries in magnitude of depth perception did not correlate with their asymmetries in vergence initiation. The similarity of the asymmetric depth magnitude estimation for a given individual at both stimulus locations tested suggests that common neural mechanisms are responsible for central and peripheral depth magnitude estimation. The lack of correlation between the perceptual and motor responses to the same stimuli suggests that the neural pathways for these responses diverge shortly after the detection of disparity in primary visual cortex."},{"method":"Nine patients with cerebellar lesions were compared to controls while they made saccades with and without simultaneous pointing movements towards a target that was either temporally predictable or non-predictable. The direction and amplitude of the target step was always predictable.","background":"This study investigated the effect of cerebellar lesions on temporal prediction and coordination in eye and hand movements.","conclusion":"Patients made much more early and late saccades than controls, but an equal amount of visually triggered saccades. This suggests that inappropriate saccades could be suppressed during the preparation of a goal-directed saccade. Hand movement frequency did not differ between both groups. Thus, cerebellar lesions can induce inappropriate saccades more easily than inappropriate hand movements. Controls, but not patients, generated visually triggered saccades of shorter latencies when the target was temporally predictable. Thus, the patients could not use information about target timing to synchronise visually triggered saccades with the target. They could, however, use this information to improve the suppression of inappropriate saccades. Regarding coordination, patients showed impairments in synchronising saccades with hand movements. Nevertheless, hand movements led to an enhancement of anticipatory saccades in patients as in controls. Moreover, hand movements and temporal predictability affected saccadic accuracy in both groups similarly. These results suggest that cerebellar lesions do not generally prevent access to temporal information on the rhythm of a target sequence or the timing of a planned hand movement. More specifically, the cerebellum seems to be crucial for synchronizing saccades with such learned or planned temporal events."},{"method":"In the present work, rats with either bilateral excitotoxic (ibotenate) lesions of the PPTg (lesion group) or with vehicle infusions (control group) were tested in an elevated plus-maze, in order to measure anxiety-like behaviours and spontaneous locomotion. Subsequently, they were trained in a delayed matching-to-position (DMTP) task in a T-maze (a two-response choice task). After reaching a predefined learning criterion, or after a maximum of 30 training sessions, the animals were trained in a delayed non-matching-to-position (DNMTP) task.","background":"Lesions of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) can impair spatial learning tasks, but it is not clear whether those detrimental effects depend on the specific training conditions (for example, number of response choices available) or are secondary to enhanced anxiety.","conclusion":"Lesioned animals made less grooming episodes, stretch-attend postures and closed arm entries than controls in the elevated plus-maze, suggesting slightly lower anxiety levels. None of the lesioned rats reached the learning criterion for the DMTP, and overall accuracy levels were significantly lower in those rats, compared to controls. In the DNMTP task, lesioned animals showed lower accuracy levels and higher side bias than controls in some of the sessions, but there were no significant differences between the two groups in the proportion of animals reaching the learning criterion. It is concluded that spatial learning deficits induced by damage to the PPTg are not secondary to enhanced anxiety. Instead, those deficits seem to be influenced by several conditions that modify task demands, the number of response choices being only one of such conditions."},{"method":"We tested the effects of intracranial self-stimulation in three consecutive learning phases which tried to make the task progressively more difficult: 10 s delay (D10 phase), 30 s delay (D30 phase), and inverting the starting position of the animals to make their response more dependent on allocentric cues (INV phase). Every phase finished when each rat achieved a fixed learning criterion.","background":"Previous research has shown that post-training intracranial self-stimulation facilitates implicit or procedural memory. To know whether it can also facilitate explicit memory, post-training intracranial self-stimulation was given to Wistar rats immediately after every daily session of a delayed spatial alternation task that seems to depend on the integrity of the hippocampal memory system.","conclusion":"Intracranial self-stimulation facilitated the flexible expression of the learned response (INV phase). That is, when the starting position was randomly inverted, only the rats that received intracranial self-stimulation maintained the performance level acquired in the previous training phases. Changing the starting position reduced the correct performance of the non-treated subjects, which need more training sessions to achieve the learning criterion and made less correct responses than treated rats. These findings show that post-training intracranial self-stimulation can facilitate hippocampus-dependent memories."},{"method":"In this study, we examined both maternal and intermale aggression in wild-type (WT) and CRFR2-deficient mice.","background":"Maternal aggression is a form of aggression towards intruders by lactating females that is critical for defense of offspring. During lactation, fear and anxiety are reduced, the CNS is less responsive to the anxiogenic neuropeptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), and central injections of CRF inhibit maternal aggression. Together, these previous findings suggest that decreased CRF neurotransmission during lactation supports normal maternal aggression expression. Recent work indicates that mice deficient in CRF receptor 2 (CRFR2) display increased anxiety-like behaviors, have a hypersensitive stress response, and overproduce CRF.","conclusion":"CRFR2-mutant mice exhibited significant deficits in maternal aggression on postpartum Day 4 relative to WT mice in terms of percentage displaying aggression, mean number of attacks, and mean time in aggressive encounters. However, time sniffing male intruder, pup retrieval, number of pups, and performance on the elevated plus maze were similar between genotypes. In contrast, intermale aggression did not differ between genotype in any measure on any of three consecutive test days. For neither form of aggression did sites of attacks on the intruder differ between genotype. Taken together, the results suggest that differences in stress sensitivity and the overproduction of CRF of the knockout (KO) mice specifically affects maternal, but not intermale aggression."},{"method":"Adolescent cocaine-treated hamsters and saline-treated littermates were scored for offensive aggression and then sacrificed 1 day later and examined for the number of FOS immunoreactive (FOS-ir) cells in regions of the hamster forebrain important for aggression control. When compared with non-aggressive, saline-treated controls, aggressive cocaine-treated hamsters showed persistent increases in the number of FOS-ir cells in several aggression regions, including the anterior hypothalamus, nucleus circularis, lateral hypothalamus (i.e., the hypothalamic attack area), lateral septum, and medial and corticomedial amygdaloid nuclei. Conversely, aggressive cocaine-treated hamsters showed a significant decrease in FOS-ir cells in the medial supraoptic nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and central amygdala when compared with controls. However, no differences in FOS-ir cells were found in other areas implicated in aggression such as the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, or in a number of non-aggression areas.","background":"Hamsters repeatedly exposed to cocaine throughout adolescence display highly escalated offensive aggression compared to saline-treated littermates. The current study investigated whether adolescent cocaine exposure activated neurons in areas of hamster forebrain implicated in aggressive behavior by examining the expression of FOS, i.e., the protein product of the immediate early gene c-fos shown to be a reliably sensitive marker of neuronal activation.","conclusion":"These results suggest that adolescent cocaine exposure may constitutively activate neurons in select forebrain areas critical for the regulation of aggression in hamsters. A model for how persistent activation of neurons in one of these brain regions (i.e., the hypothalamus) may facilitate the development of the aggressive phenotype in adolescent cocaine-exposed animals is presented."},{"method":"Rats were treated with quetiapine (10 mg\/kg\/day; i.p.) for 33 days.

The present study was designed to examine the possible effects of chronic administration of quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, on the anxiety-like behavioural consequences of a neurotoxic regimen of dl-amphetamine.","conclusion":"The repeated administration of dl-amphetamine resulted in a decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunostaining in the caudate putamen, hyperthermia, and anxiety-like behavioural changes. The behavioural changes were indicated by a significant increase in the time spent in the light box in the light\/dark box test, an increase in the ratios of ambulation distance inside the inner circle over the total ambulation distance and rearings inside the inner circle over the total rearings in the open field test, and an increase in the time spent in open arms in the elevated plus-maze test. Chronic administration of quetiapine significantly attenuated the dl-amphetamine-induced hyperthermia, and the anxiety-like behavioural changes in the light\/dark box and in the open field tests. These results suggest that quetiapine can normalize the dl-amphetamine-induced anxiety-like behavioural changes, and might be helpful in the treatment for amphetamine-induced emotional changes."},{"method":"The present study tested the effects of thioperamide (0, 10 and 20 mg\/kg, i.p.), an H3 autoreceptor antagonist, on the development of a conditioned place preference induced by cocaine (0, 2 and 8 mg\/kg, i.p.) in C57BL\/6J mice. Thioperamide was injected 10 min before each cocaine-pairing session. The activity scores recorded on the first cocaine-pairing session were also used to test the effects of thioperamide on cocaine-induced locomotor activity.","background":"The histaminergic system has been speculated to be involved in the inhibitory control of drug reward, H1 and H2 antagonists having been found to potentiate conditioned place preference induced by morphine or cocaine. In contrast, the role of H3 receptors in cocaine-induced place preference is still unknown.","conclusion":"Thioperamide alone had no reinforcing effects and did not affect the conditioned place preference induced by 8 mg\/kg cocaine. However, thioperamide dose-dependently revealed a conditioned place preference induced by 2 mg\/kg cocaine, a dose that was inactive per se. Finally, thioperamide dose-dependently potentiated the stimulant effects of cocaine, in spite of its slight hypolocomotor effect when given alone. Our results strongly suggest that H3 antagonists potentiate the stimulant and reinforcing effects of cocaine in mice."},{"method":"9 subjects were measured with multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) over the left and right lateral prefrontal cortex.

These effects indicate that an active control condition is necessary for the adequate interpretation of the results. Most importantly, we found significantly higher increases of [O2Hb] and decreases of [HHb] during the inhibition phase as compared to the simple motor response in bilateral inferior frontal regions of the brain, which is in accordance with other brain imaging studies. With the introduction of an active control condition in this study, we improved the methodology of a previous investigation.

Two of these changes include decreases in cognitive functions mediated by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and significant decreases in norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA). To investigate whether the changes in these neurotransmitter systems are directly related to the cognitive decline seen in aging we utilized the rhesus monkey as a model of normal human aging. Our goal was to determine if age-related changes in cognition is associated with changes in norepinephrine and dopamine receptor binding density in the PFC.","conclusion":"Aged animals as a group demonstrated significant cognitive impairments and aging produced a significant decrease in alpha-1 adrenergic and alpha-2 adrenergic receptor binding in the PFC but no significant change in binding for the DA1 receptor or the NE or DA uptake receptors. Further analysis revealed a significant relationship between monoamine receptor binding and cognitive performance on three tasks: delayed non-matching to sample, delayed recognition span test and the conceptual set-shifting task."},{"method":"Mice (n = 16) were placed in the home cage system for 6 consecutive days.

Wheel running affected the hourly pattern of movement during the animals' active period of the day. Mice without a running wheel, in contrast to mice with a running wheel, showed a clear differentiation between novelty-induced and baseline levels of locomotion as reflected by a decrease after the first day of introduction to the home cage. The results are discussed in the light of the use of running wheels as a tool to measure general activity and as an object for environmental enrichment. Furthermore, the possibilities of using automated home cage observations for e.g. behavioural phenotyping are discussed."},{"method":"Rats with electrodes in the dorsal hippocampus lapped at a milk dipper and were presented a tone which predicted the delivery of a food pellet. In some trials the pellet cue tone was negated by 60-Hz clicks beginning 0.3 s after onset, and no pellet was delivered. A video capture system (20-ms sampling) synchronized to the hippocampal recording system (10-ms sampling) was used to determine the onset of locomotor approach to the pellet area.","background":"This study determined if the hippocampal theta rhythm showed phase relationships or changes in amplitude and frequency with the onset of stimuli and locomotion in a task in which auditory cues initiated and suppressed approach locomotion.","conclusion":"The findings failed to support proposals that phase-related mechanisms play a role in encoding and retrieval of movement-related information. Neither the pellet cue nor the negating cue reset the theta rhythm, and they did not produce differential evoked potentials. During milk lapping, theta amplitude increased in the 1\/2s prior to all pellet cues regardless of their locomotor effect. Frequency also rose but only when a non-negated pellet elicited short-latency locomotion. During locomotor execution, theta peak amplitude peaked earlier than theta frequency by approximately one period. In general during performance of this task, increasing theta amplitude reflected a general preparation to process the cue and increasing theta frequency reflected the readiness to respond to the cue with locomotion."},{"method":"Aged Wistar rats were treated with zopiclone at a dose of 3 mg\/kg (i.p., once a day) beginning 4 days before ischemia induction and continuing for 23 days.

After a 7-day washout period all rats were administered a single dose of zopiclone (3 mg\/kg, i.p.) and retested. Infarct volumes were measured from nitroblue tetrazolium-stained sections at the end of the experiment.","background":"Sedative-hypnotic drugs commonly used in the elderly may affect functional recovery following cerebrovascular events. Previous research has shown that prolonged exposure to diazepam can interfere with recovery of function and exaggerate tissue loss after brain injury. The present study evaluated the effect of zopiclone, a widely used hypnotic drug, on functional and histological outcome after cortical photothrombosis in aged rats, which might be particularly vulnerable to brain insults and inhibitory sedative-hypnotic drugs.","conclusion":"Beam-walking data showed that ischemic rats treated with zopiclone were not more impaired than untreated rats. Indeed, they showed fewer faults with the impaired hindlimb than ischemic controls on post-operative day 16. Water-maze performance was not affected by zopiclone. After the washout period a single dose of zopiclone did not worsen forelimb or hindlimb function, but seemed to improve performance in the water-maze test. Cortical infarct volumes were similar in ischemic controls and ischemic rats treated with zopiclone. In conclusion, zopiclone was not detrimental and even seemed to improve behavioral outcome without affecting ischemic damage in aged rats subjected to cortical photothrombosis."},{"method":"Nine monkeys received unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions. Seven weeks later, four received kainic acid lesions of the SNr. Behavioural tests were performed prior to 6-OHDA surgery and then fortnightly for 14 weeks.","background":"Current neurosurgical strategies target overactive brain regions including the subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus and thalamus to control various symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Subthalamotomy improves akinesia and can induce postural deficits in both parkinsonian humans and animals, pallidotomy improves limb dyskinesia and more variably, distal bradykinesia whilst thalamotomy improves tremor. Because the SNr also becomes overactive in PD and there are few surgical studies in parkinsonian primates, we therefore evaluated the effects of lesioning the SNr in hemiparkinsonian marmosets to establish the effects on symptomatology.","conclusion":"Unilateral 6-OHDA lesions induced ipsilateral postural bias, ipsilateral rotation after amphetamine injection and bradykinesia. Whilst, SNr lesions significantly altered the direction of head position and amphetamine-induced rotation relative to 6-OHDA lesions, there was no improvement in 6-OHDA-induced reaching deficits or sensorimotor neglect. Unbiased quantitation of the nigral lesions showed on average 88% loss of dopaminergic neurons after 6-OHDA lesions and 77% loss of non-dopaminergic neurons after SNr lesions.

This research sought to determine the functional contribution of each opioid receptor in modulating social attachment\/separation distress.","conclusion":"DAMGO attenuated separation distress vocalizations. No other drug probe enhanced or attenuated distress vocalizations. Further, the non-selective opiate antagonist naloxone (0.3, 8.3, 27.5 nmol) did not exacerbate distress vocalizations.

Rats were then challenged with MDMA (5 mg\/kg i.p.) after 12 days of withdrawal.","background":"There is ample evidence that plastic changes in the nervous system require the excitatory amino acid transmission. This appears to be also the case for psychostimulant-induced behavioral sensitization. More specifically the glutamatergic input from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to the VTA and the NAc appears to be involved in behavioral sensitization processes. However, dissociations regarding the role of the mPFC with respect to the development and expression of sensitization, as well as with respect to the psychostimulant being studied (amphetamine versus cocaine) appear to exist. The present study examined the role of the dorsal mPFC in the development and expression of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-induced sensitization.","conclusion":"Ibotenic acid lesions did not affect the activating effects of MDMA, but prevented the development and expression of MDMA sensitization. Thus, the distance traveled during the development phase of sensitization increased in sham-lesioned rats but not in ibotenic-lesioned animals. Similarly, sham-lesioned rats showed a sensitized response when challenged with MDMA after the withdrawal period, an effect not observed in ibotenic-lesioned animals.

The DRL inter-response time (IRT) distribution for the DG-lesioned rats and the sham-operated controls was similar; however, while the distribution peak for the control rats was 20s, it was 16s for the DG-lesioned rats, indicating that the latter rats underestimated time. Performance of the DG-lesioned rats was also disrupted in the DNMTP task. However, DG-lesioned rats recovered control levels of performance during repeated training with an intertrial interval equal to 3s. An increase in intertrial interval in lesioned and sham-operated controls disrupted performance in both groups; however, while DG-lesioned rats performed at chance levels when the intertrial interval was increased to 4min or longer, the sham-operated controls performed at chance levels only when the intertrial interval was increased to 16min.

Rats with electrolytic lesions to the n. acc. shell and core showed different patterns of effect in aversive (Experiment 1) and appetitive (Experiment 2) variants of this procedure.","background":"The nucleus accumbens (n. acc.) has been implicated in conditioning to both discrete and contextual cues but its precise role is as yet controversial because conflicting patterns of effect have been reported. These inconsistencies may relate to the extent to which the lesions used encroach on different subfields of n. acc. and the use of different task variants.","conclusion":"In Experiment 1, the core lesion reduced the difference between trace and contiguously conditioned groups, in responding to the discrete noise stimulus. However, neither lesion had any detectable effect on contextual conditioning. In Experiment 2, the shell lesion clearly increased contextual conditioning, selectively in the trace conditioned group, but neither lesion had any detectable effect on discrete cue conditioning.

They were located within or close to the inter-colliculus nucleus. A train of stimulations was applied and PPI was tested alternately during and between periods of stimulation. As the most common method used to attenuate PPI consists in administrating drugs, for example ketamine, we also tested the effect of this drug. Another drug was also tested, diazepam, since it alters the functioning of the IC without any known effect on PPI. This allowed a comparative analysis of the neurobiological and the pharmacological effects.","background":"The magnitude of an acoustic startle response can be reduced by a weak stimulus presented immediately before the startle-eliciting noise. This phenomenon has been termed prepulse inhibition of the startle reaction (PPI). Previous studies indicated that the primary neural pathways mediating PPI belong to the brain stem and that the inferior colliculus (IC) was crucial. Its destruction reduced PPI. Stimulations applied to brain areas may be as deleterious as lesions. Therefore, we looked for the possibility of a brain stimulation applied to the IC during a PPI test to reduce also PPI.","conclusion":"It appeared that the stimulation decreased PPI quantitatively as much as ketamine (6 mg\/kg) without an effect of the basic startle reaction. These effects did not interfere with each other. Diazepam (1 mg\/kg) did not modify PPI, neither under stimulation nor per se.

Its source was located in the anterior cingulate cortex, with the exact location being dependent upon working memory demands.

Treatment with imipramine (10mg\/kg i.p., once daily) commenced after experimental week 3.","background":"Chronic mild stress (CMS) has been reported to induce an anhedonic-like state in rats that resembles some of the symptoms of endogenous depression in humans.","conclusion":"CMS induced significant reductions in absolute and relative sucrose intake and sucrose preference in both rat strains but their temporal pattern was different especially during the weeks 0-3. These effects were reversed by IMI. An increase in the dopaminergic and a decrease in the serotonergic activity were observed in the prefrontal cortex in both rat strains following CMS. A decrease in the striatal dopaminergic activity and an increased hippocampal serotonergic activity were also seen in both rat strains following CMS. In Wistar rats, dopaminergic and serotonergic activities were enhanced in the hypothalamus whereas in Sprague-Dawley rats no such stress-induced changes were observed. Notably, the clear decrease in sucrose consumption observed in stressed Wistar rats could be directly associated with a respective increase in the dopaminergic hypothalamic activity. Chronic treatment with imipramine normalized all neurochemical alterations induced by CMS. Our results suggest that a specific and regionally differentiated serotonin-dopamine interaction is directly related to the observed stress-induced anhedonia."},{"method":"We investigated the interaction between serotonergic activation and aggressive behavior by assessing the co-localization of the c-Fos signal (marker of neuronal activation) with tryptophan-hydroxylase activity (marker of serotonin secretion) in the raphe. Control rats were compared with rats exposed to visual and olfactory (but not physical) contacts with opponents (psychosocial stimulation) as well as with rats exposed to aggressive encounters.","background":"The serotonergic system is well known for its aggression lowering effects. It has been shown repeatedly, however, that the serotonergic system is activated during fights, and recent data suggested that it is necessary for the expression of aggressive behavior.","conclusion":"Fights were accompanied by the activation of the raphe; however, the effect was not aggression-specific, as a similar activation was induced by psychosocial contacts. The lack of behavioral specificity in activation suggests that it was related to social arousal rather than to the execution of fights. The activation of serotonergic raphe neurons showed a negative correlation with aggressive behavior, which is in line with the widespread view that serotonin neurotransmission downregulates aggressive behavior. The activation of serotonergic neurons did not show a correlation with measures of hypoarousal-driven abnormal aggression, which indicates that factors other than the raphe control this behavior. The latter finding may explain the low efficacy of serotonergic treatments in conduct and antisocial personality disorders, in which violence correlates with hypoarousal."},{"method":"In this study, we report that the chronic presentation of an emotionally important stimulus-food-from the left side, improves reproductive performance in animals in a broad range of feeding conditions.","background":"It is known that the right and left brain hemispheres differ in their ability to regulate autonomic processes in the organism. Direct unilateral stimulation of the brain provokes side-dependent endocrine, immune and other visceral reactions. Since brain hemispheres are mainly involved in the regulation of muscles and sensory organs on the contra lateral side of the body the activation of behavioural asymmetry stimulates the contra lateral half of the brain. The important theoretical and practical question of whether autonomic processes can be regulated via the behavioural asymmetry route remains unexplored.","conclusion":"The unilateral presentation of food can also influence lactation, but in this case the side-dependent effects are different under varying feeding conditions. This finding opens a simple practical approach to influence basic somatic functions in the organism."},{"method":"In the present study, a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) procedure was used to investigate the effects of the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), and the psychotomimetic drugs, phencyclidine (PCP) and d-amphetamine (d-AMP) on LI.","background":"Latent inhibition (LI) is a behavioural procedure used to evaluate the potential propsychotic and antipsychotic properties of psychoactive drugs.","conclusion":"PCP (2 mg\/kg) and d-AMP (0.5 mg\/kg) were both found to enhance LI in this procedure. The effect of d-AMP on LI was less pronounced and this drug also caused a weak disruption of taste aversion conditioning. Pretreatment with L-NAME (10 mg\/kg) blocked the LI enhancing effect of PCP on LI but not that of d-AMP. L-NAME by itself caused an attenuation of LI. L-NAME has been shown to block also other behavioural and biochemical effects of PCP in previous studies and these results and the present findings suggest that at least some of the effects PCP are dependent on NO and possibly also that some NOS inhibitors may exert antipsychotic properties."},{"method":"In the present study we investigated whether the observation and\/or hearing of eating actions facilitate eating behaviors in observing\/listening pig-tailed macaques.

In other words, motor programs similar to those observed can be recruited. Since this phenomenon is expressed when in the presence of another individual, it has been named social facilitation.","conclusion":"We propose that eating facilitation triggered by observation or listening of eating actions can rely on the mirror neuron system of ventral premotor cortex that provides a matching between the observed\/listened action and the executed action.

We used a two-odour-choice classical conditioning paradigm in mice from the day of birth (post-natal age 0, P0) to P6. Acquisition required 20 trials: 10 trials during which the pups were placed over the conditioned stimulus (CS+) odour (lemon or peppermint) for 30s and simultaneously stroked gently with a paintbrush and 10 trials during which the pups were placed over the other odour (CS-) for 30s, without stroking. Then, the pups were subjected to five odour-preference trials to test for conditioning. This sequence of five trials was repeated after 5 and 24h to assess retention of the conditioned odour preference.","background":"Determining the behavioural phenotype of genetically altered mice is a valuable approach for elucidating the function of genes and their role in cognitive disorders. Methods for phenotyping newborn mice are scarce and generally confined to sensorimotor reflexes.","conclusion":"During the immediate post-acquisition sequence, the pups spent significantly more time over the CS+ than over the CS- (p&lt;0.0001). No extinction of the conditioned preference was observed during this test. No preference was observed after 5 or 24h, indicating that the conditioned response was promptly lost. Conditioning was effective as soon as P0-P1. Thus, conditioning may emerge in newborn mice sooner than previously reported. This paradigm is well suited to phenotyping of large samples of genetically altered mice and may shed light on the role for genes in paediatric cognitive impairments."},{"method":"Number of ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs) were recorded on pnds 9, 11 and 13. On pnd 13 rats underwent a homing test to measure olfactory orientation towards nest material.","background":"We analysed the effects of 192 IgG-saporin lesions on pnd 7 upon neonatal behavioural responses.","conclusion":"192 IgG-saporin reduced the number of USVs at all ages considered while increasing number of entrancies into the nest area.

The present study focused on the neurobiology involved in the acquisition and expression of conditioned reinforcing effects of morphine withdrawal employing a conditioned place aversion (CPA) paradigm in acute-dependent rats.","conclusion":"Naloxone dose-dependently produced CPA in rats given a single morphine exposure. In CeA, but not MeA with high-level constitutive neuronal activity, the naloxone-induced modification in c-Fos immunoreactivity following morphine pretreatment exhibited a dose-dependent pattern similar to that seen in the behavioral study. On the other hand, none of the three amygdaloid nuclei examined including CeA, MeA and BLA showed notable sensitivity of c-Fos to the conditioned withdrawal stimulus. These results suggest that CeA may play a role in the negative affective aspect of withdrawal from acute dependence, and in part suggest that the acquisition and expression of CPA may involve different neurobiological mechanisms."},{"method":"Both intracerebroventricular infusion of NPY (10 microg) and intraperitoneal injection of CCK-8 (0.5 micro\/kg) reduced the intake of a 1M solution of sucrose infused intraorally at a rate of 0.5 ml\/min in ovariectomized female rats, but the two peptides did not interact in inhibiting intraoral intake. By contrast, NPY increased intake if the sucrose solution was ingested from a bottle, a test demanding both appetitive and consummatory ingestive responses. CCK-8 inhibited intake in this test and its inhibitory effect was increased by simultaneous treatment with NPY. The activity in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), a brainstem relay mediating inhibition of intake, judged by the expression of c-fos-like immunoreactivity, was significantly increased after treatment with CCK-8 or NPY to approximately the same extent.

Locomotor activity was measured by an ambulometer.","background":"Repetitive exposure to psychostimulants elicits behavioral sensitization. Accumulating evidence have shown that the central GABAergic system is involved in psychostimulants sensitization.

Co-administration of valproate with METH or cocaine dose-dependently inhibited the development of behavioral sensitization. Single administration of valproate (37.5, 75, 150 mg\/kg) did not affect the expression of behavioral sensitization induced by METH and cocaine. Multiple administration of valproate (37.5, 75, 150 mg\/kg) dose-dependently inhibited the expression of behavioral sensitization to METH, but not to cocaine. The present results supported that METH- and cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization possesses distinct neural mechanisms, which implies that valproate may have different modulatory effect on METH and cocaine addiction in humans."},{"method":"In the present study, the effects of administration of CRF and NPY into the lateral ventricle on ethanol intake in naive and ethanol-vapor-exposed Wistar rats were examined. A limited access paradigm was used to measure intake of a 10% (v\/v) ethanol solution in Wistar rats trained to drink using a sucrose fading procedure. Ethanol vapor exposure for 8 weeks significantly elevated ethanol intake in this limited access paradigm relative to pre-exposure levels. The effects of icv administration of CRF (1 microg), NPY (10 microg) or NPY\/CRF combined (10 and 1 microg, respectively) on ethanol intake were then assessed.","background":"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) have opposing effects on stress-associated and consummatory behaviors in rodents. Recent studies also suggest that both peptides influence ethanol intake.","conclusion":"In non-vapor-exposed subjects, icv infusion of NPY had no effect on ethanol intake, while a significant suppression of drinking was seen following icv administration of CRF. Administration of NPY in combination with CRF had no effect on ethanol intake in non-ethanol-vapor-exposed rats. In vapor-exposed subjects, both NPY and CRF reduced ethanol intake, but when given in combination, no difference from vehicle was detected. Locomotor activity was measured during drinking sessions and was unaffected by peptide administration. These studies underscore the importance of a history of exposure to chronic ethanol vapor in the regulation of ethanol intake by NPY. Furthermore, the results presented here suggest that a balance between the stress-related peptides NPY and CRF may be involved in the regulation of ethanol intake."},{"method":"Immobility in the swim test was measured, as an index for depressive-like behavior, and frequencies of maternal and non-maternal behaviors were recorded using short un-intrusive observations in the home cage.","background":"In order to elucidate the relationship between maternal behavior and depression, the Flinders sensitive line (FSL) model of depression was studied and compared to Sprague-Dawley (SD) controls.","conclusion":"Lactating FSL rats displayed higher levels of immobility in the swim test compared to controls, indicating depressive-like behavior. In addition, compared to SD rats, FSL dams showed less frequent pup licking and non-nutritive contact with pups during the first and third weeks of lactation. In the third postpartum week, FSL dams showed less frequent nursing postures and more frequent self-directed behaviors. Thus, lactating FSL dams exhibit both depressed-like behavior and some abnormalities in maternal behavior."},{"method":"In the present study we investigated whether this also holds true after episodes of acute stress. PrPc gene ablated (Prnp0\/0) and wild-type mice were subjected to restraint stress, electric foot shock, or swimming and compared with non-stressed animals. Immediately after the stressful situation, the anxiety levels and locomotion of the animals were measured using plus-maze and open-field tests.","background":"Although many studies have investigated the function of cellular prion protein (PrPc), its physiologic role remains elusive. PrPc null mice have been reported to develop normally and to show normal performance in most behavioural tests.","conclusion":"Among non-stressed animals, there was no significant difference in performance between Prnp0\/0 and wild type animals in either test. However, after acute stress provoked by a foot shock or a swimming trial, Prnp0\/0 animals showed a significant decrease in anxiety levels when compared with control animals. Moreover, after the swimming test, knockout mice presented decreased locomotion when compared to wild-type mice. Because of this observation, we also assessed both types of mice in a forced swimming test with the objective of better evaluating muscle function and found that Prnp0\/0 animals presented reduced forced swimming capacity when compared to controls.

Pups in the MS group were separated daily from their mother for 180 min\/day from postnatal day 2 (PND2) to PND14. Control litters remained undisturbed. The adult male and female progeny were tested in the FPS and LES.","background":"This study was based on the higher prevalence of anxiety disorders in women than in men, and on the finding that early adverse experiences are a major risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders later in life.","conclusion":"As predicted, females showed a significantly greater potentiation of startle than males in the FPS, and a strong trend towards greater startle potentiation in the LES. Contrary to predictions, MS had no effect on startle potentiation in the FPS and severely disrupted LES in female, but not male rats. The observed sex differences add to the validity of the FPS and LES as animal paradigms of fear and anxiety. The findings indicate that these paradigms can be used to study the biological basis of sex differences in fear and anxiety. In contrast, the effects of MS on startle potentiation argue against the idea that MS provides a robust model for the predicted influences of early adverse effects on these startle potentiation measures of fear and anxiety."},{"method":"We tested dopamine beta-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh -\/-) mice that lack NA in various social behavior paradigms. Dbh -\/- mice have relatively normal performance in the elevated plus maze, light\/dark box, and open field test - three measures of anxiety - and a social recognition test.","background":"Aberrant social behavior is a hallmark of many cognitive, mood, and neurological disorders, although the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the behavioral deficits are not well understood. The neurotransmitter noradrenaline (NA) has been implicated in some of these disorders, as well as in several aspects of social behavior in humans and animals.","conclusion":"In contrast, Dbh -\/- mice displayed a specific deficit in a social discrimination task and had a nearly complete absence of resident-intruder aggression. These results indicate that intact NA signaling is required for some types of social memory and aggression, but that a lack of NA does not greatly affect anxiety in mice.

A comparison of PS2APP and control mice across ages revealed a selective age-related, delay-dependent, impairment on choice accuracy in PS2APP mice, consistent with the cognitive decline and temporal amyloidosis previously described for this mouse model.

The visual field of monkey was not measured precisely although the necessity.","conclusion":"Reliability indices demonstrated high and stable behavioral performance by both monkeys and humans. The luminance-contrast sensitivity was highest around the fovea, and declined as eccentricity increased. The blind spot was clearly detected 15 degrees temporally. The overall sensitivity was higher in humans than in monkeys and the sensitivity dropped more sharply in the periphery in monkeys than in humans.

In an automated olfactometer, rolipram treatment (1mg\/kg, i.p.) significantly impaired the detection accuracy of 1-propanol at relatively high dilutions but did not affect detection at lower dilutions. Meanwhile, the ability to discriminate amyl acetate alone from a mixture of amyl acetate+citronellal was not affected by rolipram at any odor dilution. In a different task in which mice were trained to discriminate between cups of scented versus unscented sand, rolipram treatment resulted in poorer discrimination at high and better discrimination at low, odor dilutions.","background":"The cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase PDE4A is abundant in the dendrites, soma and axons of olfactory receptor neurons of the mouse, but it is not present in the cilia, where olfactory transduction initiates. Although the function of PDE4A in mammalian olfaction is unknown, patch clamp studies on deciliated olfactory receptor cells in the newt have shown that adrenaline or cAMP analogs can increase the contrast sensitivity to current injection.","conclusion":"In sum, PDE4 inhibition resulted in a consistent decrement in the ability of mice to detect low concentrations of odorants, but the effects of rolipram on detection of higher concentrations were task-dependent."},{"method":"In the present study we addressed whether navigation in the active allothetic place avoidance (AAPA) task, which requires animals to separate spatial stimuli into coherent representations and navigate according to the representation relevant for the task, is dependent on intact muscarinic receptors in the brain.

P has membrane mechanisms of action in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to facilitate sexual receptivity of rodents.","conclusion":"The D(1) agonist, SKF38393, enhanced P-facilitated lordosis. The D(1) antagonist, SCH23390, attenuated P-facilitated lordosis. The D(2) agonist, quinpirole and the D(2) antagonist, sulpiride, had no significant effects on P-facilitated lordosis.

In the second, they were examined in rats with combined lesion of habenula plus pinealectomy compared to sham-operated controls, to examine whether pinealectomy induced further deficits when combined with habenula damage. Lesions of habenula were confirmed histologically and neurochemically by reduction of choline acetyltransferase in the interpeduncular nucleus. Pinealectomy was confirmed post mortem by careful visual inspection.","background":"In the midbrain, the epithalamus comprises the habenular nuclei and the pineal gland. Based on evidence including imaging studies in schizophrenia patients, several investigators have postulated that dysfunction of this structure is causally involved in symptoms of schizophrenia. Recently, we showed that bilateral habenula lesions in the rat induced some schizophrenia-like behavioural changes, namely memory and attention impairments, but unaltered social interaction in a brief encounter and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex.","conclusion":"Pinealectomy induced no deficits in any test, while combined lesions led to the same pattern of deficits as previously observed after habenula lesion, i.e. marked memory impairment in the Morris water maze without affecting the amount of social interaction or PPI of the startle reflex.

Recent animal experiments have demonstrated that transient prenatal vitamin D deficiency is associated with persistent alterations in brain morphology and neurotrophin expression.","conclusion":"Compared to control animals, the prenatally deplete animals had a significant impairment of latent inhibition, a feature often associated with schizophrenia. In addition, the deplete group was (a) significantly impaired on hole board habituation and (b) significantly better at maintaining previously learnt rules of brightness discrimination in a Y-chamber. In contrast, the prenatally deplete animals showed no impairment on the spatial learning task in the radial maze, nor on two-way active avoidance learning in the shuttle-box. The results indicate that transient prenatal vitamin D depletion in the rat is associated with subtle and discrete alterations in learning and memory.

Fibronectin (FN) is a major component of the ECM in the CNS and plays essential roles in development, cell adhesion and cell migration. Specific FN-isoforms, generated by alternative splicing at three conserved regions, the extra domain B (EDB), extra domain A (EDA) and type III homologies connecting segment (IIICS), have been shown to modulate these processes in vitro and in vivo. The inclusion of the EDA exon in the brain is highly regulated during development and aging, suggesting an important role of this exon in brain function. However, the direct role of FN-isoforms in brain function and behaviour is still obscure.","conclusion":"Here, we show the behavioural consequences of the absence of regulated splicing of the EDA exon in the FN gene. Deletion of the EDA domain in the FN protein results in reduced motor-coordination abilities and vertical exploratory capacity, whereas mice that constitutively include the EDA domain displayed a decrease in locomotory activity in the open field (OF) test.

Murine models for the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses include the well-characterized motor neuron degeneration (mnd\/mnd) model for one variant of late infantile NCL (CLN8), and the more recently generated models for the infantile (CLN1) and juvenile (CLN3) forms of NCL. To determine whether these mouse models exhibit behavioral deficits analogous to the learning impairment characteristic of the human disorders, the performance of these animals on an associative learning task was assessed.","conclusion":"Normal mice were able to reach a criterion for having learned to make the association within a mean of 9.4 trials. The CLN8 and CLN3 mice, on the other hand, required means of 26.2 and 27.5 trials, respectively, to reach the same performance criterion (p&lt;0.05), whereas none of the CLN1 mice were able to reach the criterion within a limit of 30 trials. The poor performance of the mutant mice did not appear to result from impaired retinal function; mice of all three strains exhibited retinal electrophysiological responses to dim light flashes and displayed robust pupillary light reflexes. Associative learning deficits appear to be an early disease phenotype in the NCL mouse models that will be useful for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions such as gene or stem cell therapies."},{"method":"We then investigated whether a systemically-injected quaternary-ammonium derivate of this antagonist (scopolamine methylbromide; MBR), which poorly crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB), altered maze performance after a 45-min exposure to 2.45 GHz electromagnetic field (EMF; 2 micros pulse width, 500 pps, whole-body specific energy absorption rate [SAR] of 2.0 W\/kg, +\/-2dB and brain averaged SAR of 3.0 W\/kg, +\/-3 dB); if observed, such an alteration would reflect changes in BBB permeability. The drug was injected before or after exposure. Controls were naive rats (no experience of the exposure device) and sham-exposed rats (experience of the exposure device without microwaves). In a final approach, rats were subjected to i.v. injections of Evans blue, a dye binding serum albumin, before or after EMF exposure.","background":"We first verified that our 12-arm radial maze test enabled demonstration of memory deficits in rats treated with the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine hydrobromide (0.5mg\/kg, i.p.).","conclusion":"Whether scopolamine MBR was injected before or after exposure, the exposed rats did not perform differently from their naive or sham-exposed counterparts. Thus, EMFs most probably failed to disrupt the BBB. This conclusion was further supported by the absence of Evans blue extravasation into the brain parenchyma of our exposed rats."},{"method":"Here, we attempted another replication using a maze apparatus bordered by 30 cm high opaque walls.","background":"Lai et al. [Lai H, Horita A, Guy AW. Microwave irradiation affects radial-arm maze performance in the rat. Bioelectromagnetics 1994;15(2):95-104] reported that exposure of rats to pulsed 2.45 GHz microwaves altered maze performance. Their maze was bordered by 20 cm high opaque walls. Using a maze test based on unrestrained access to spatial cues (no walls), we could not replicate this result [Cassel JC, Cosquer B, Galani R, Kuster N. Whole-body exposure to 2.45 GHz electromagnetic fields does not alter radial-maze performance in rats. Behav Brain Res 2004;155:37-43].","conclusion":"Performance of exposed rats was normal. These results show that microwave exposure as used herein does not alter spatial working memory, when access to spatial cues is reduced."},{"method":"Male Wistar rats were treated with either diazepam (4 mg\/kg) or vehicle for 14 days, then abruptly withdrawn for 24h. Animals were tested in the social interaction paradigm and elevated plus maze. Some diazepam-withdrawn rats were pre-treated with 5HT2 antagonists 60 min before behavioural testing.","background":"Administration of benzodiazepines is known to be associated with tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome on abrupt cessation. The aetiology of the withdrawal syndrome is not known but a role for the serotonin (5HT) system is suspected. The aim of the current study was to investigate the usefulness of 5-HT2 antagonists in the treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the rat.","conclusion":"Acute withdrawal from benzodiazepines significantly reduced social interaction between pairs compared to vehicle or diazepam-treated animals. Similarly, for the elevated plus maze withdrawn animals made fewer entries and spent less time on the open arms than did vehicle or diazepam-treated animals. Single doses of 5-HT2 antagonists, mianserin (5mg\/kg) and ritanserin (1mg\/kg), effectively ameliorated withdrawal anxiety in the rat, returning behavioural function in the social interaction test and elevated plus maze to levels comparable to vehicle-treated animals."},{"method":"Differences in the c-fos expression of CA1, CA3, BL Amygdala, LS and BNST were found between the short- or long-context groups with a pre-exposure before cued conditioning. Ce Amygdala showed no differences in the c-fos expression labeling. We reported the hippocampal c-fos activation during the cued fear conditioning acquisition.","background":"The c-fos expression was used to study the neural substrates of the cued fear conditioning acquisition, preceded by a short exposure versus a long exposure to the conditioning context. A long-context exposure (either during the night or during the day) prior to conditioning, was associated with low freezing in the learning test.","conclusion":"Specifically, the CA1 activation could be related with the context-US processing during the CS-US association acquisition, which might prove that the CS-US associations cannot be made without an integrated context participating. The results showed that a long-context exposure prior to cued conditioning produces an inhibition of the CR (freezing), and this phenomenon is related with a specific c-fos expression in CA1, CA3, BL Amygdala, LS and BNST during the fear acquisition."},{"method":"For this, it was investigated whether a treatment of regular reward announcements could prevent the development of anhedonia.","background":"It is known that stress can influence the sensitivity to rewarding stimuli. Previous observations revealed that socially stressed rats do not display an appetitive behavioural response in anticipation of a reward. A previous study showed that this insensitivity to rewards (anhedonia) could be restored by chronic administration of an antidepressant. Several lines of evidence exist for the role of dopamine in the mechanism of action of antidepressant treatments concerning their therapeutic effect on anhedonia. Therefore, it was hypothesized that regular activation of the reward system, that involves mesolimbic dopaminergic systems, could counteract the effect of social stress on reward-sensitivity.","conclusion":"This was confirmed by the result that socially stressed rats that received this treatment were able to display anticipatory behaviour which is characterized by increased activity after presentation of a stimulus that was previously associated with a sucrose reward. Surprisingly, a non-treated socially stressed group, that did not show an anticipatory response for sucrose, did display anticipatory behaviour for another type of reward (enriched cage). It seems that, although one might assume the existence of an anhedonic state based upon the absence of anticipatory activity towards a sucrose reward, this assumption cannot be generalised to other types of reward. It will be discussed whether this might be caused by the highly rewarding properties of the enriched cage which probably has a therapeutical efficacy of its own."},{"method":"In all experiments, a behavioural testing was performed 3 weeks after TMT administration. Experiment 1: A single TMT oral dose, 5 and 7.5 but not 2.5mg\/kg, impaired the natural ability of the adults to recognize a juvenile conspecific that they encountered 30 min before. The dose of 5mg\/kg TMT was chosen to be used in subsequent experiments. Experiment 2: Chronic OXI pre-+post-treatment, daily 3 or 30 mg\/kg sc for 7 days before and 7 days after the insult, protected the adults against recognition deficit produced by TMT. Experiment 3: OXI pre- but not post-treatment (always 3 and 30 mg\/kg) had beneficial effects on the social recognition.","background":"The social recognition paradigm was used to investigate the effect of trimethyltin (TMT) in adult male rats. Consequently, the effect of chronic oxiracetam (OXI) treatment in TMT impaired animals was evaluated.","conclusion":"The findings suggest that social recognition ability of adult male rats pre-treated sufficiently long with OXI is resistant to the neurotoxicity effect of TMT."},{"method":"Accordingly, electroencephalographic (EEG), electromyographic (EMG) and kinetic recordings were conducted while eight subjects initiated gait and were stepping in three different directions (namely, forward, backward and lateral). Five different movement-related potentials were extracted from the EEG recordings and statistically analyzed. Movement parameters were extracted from kinetic recordings and statistically analyzed as well.","background":"The influence of directional orientation on movement-related potentials (MRPs) during gait initiation and stepping has been investigated in the present study, as well as possible effects caused by the distinction between gait initiation and stepping.","conclusion":"Results indicated that variations in directional orientation of gait and stepping were associated to changes in MRPs, but the associations between movement parameters and MRPs were conditional to the kind of task performed. Gait tasks were mainly differentiated in early MRPs while stepping tasks were more differentiated in late MRPs, indicating that differences between gait initiation and stepping might be associated with different levels of preparation and execution. Apparently the changes found in the movement-related potentials were not simply caused by changes in the sensorial input due to perception of the spatial environment, but rather because of variations in the movement kinematics and kinetics."},{"method":"Both learning and retention of the spatial version of the water maze were assessed. To assess retrograde retention of spatial information, half of the rats were pre-trained on the maze before the treatment manipulations of pyrithiamine (PT)-induced thiamine deficiency and post-tested after treatment (pre-trained group). The other half of the animals was only trained after treatment to assess anterograde amnesia (post-trained group).","background":"This is a factorial (2 x 2 x 2) spatial memory and cholinergic parameters study in which the factors are chronic ethanol, thiamine deficiency and naivety in Morris water maze task.","conclusion":"Thiamine deficiency, associated to chronic ethanol treatment, had a significant deleterious effect on spatial memory performance of post-trained animals. The biochemical data revealed that chronic ethanol treatment reduced acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the hippocampus while leaving the neocortex unchanged, whereas thiamine deficiency reduced both cortical and hippocampal AChE activity. Regarding basal and stimulated cortical acetylcholine (ACh) release, both chronic ethanol and thiamine deficiency treatments had significant main effects. Significant correlations were found between both cortical and hippocampal AChE activity and behaviour parameters for pre-trained but not for post-trained animals. Also for ACh release, the correlation found was significant only for pre-trained animals. These biochemical parameters were decreased by thiamine deficiency and chronic ethanol treatment, both in pre-trained and post-trained animals. But the correlation with the behavioural parameters was observed only for pre-trained animals, that is, those that were retrained and assessed for retrograde retention."},{"method":"The present study investigated reinforcement processes in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), an animal model of ADHD. Using intra-cranial self-stimulation (ICSS), behavioral effects of varying current intensity, reinforcer density, and reinforcer delay were tested. Current was varied in order to find the weakest current producing the maximal response rate (optimal current) in the SHR and the controls during high (120 reinforcers\/min) and low reinforcer densities (1 reinforcer\/min).","background":"Attention deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), characterized by inappropriate levels of activity, attention, and impulsivity, has been suggested to be caused by changes in reinforcement and extinction processes possibly linked to dysfunctioning dopamine systems.","conclusion":"The results showed that optimal current was significantly lower in the SHR than in the controls during high reinforcer density while maximal response rates were not significantly different. During low reinforcer density, optimal current was not significantly different in the two strains, but maximal response rate was significantly higher in the SHR than in the controls. The SHR produced more responses during the testing of reinforcer density, but changes in reinforcer density affected response rates similarly in the two strains. The decrease in response rate as a function of reinforcer delay was more pronounced in the SHR than in the controls. Overall, more responses with short inter-response times (IRT) were found in the SHR compared to the controls during intermittent reinforcement. The results are consistent with a steepened delay-of-reinforcement gradient in SHR."},{"method":"Memantine (20 mg\/(kg day), s.c.) was continuously infused by an osmotic minipump for 4 weeks from 3 days before the microinjection of Abeta.

Aggregated Abeta1-40 was microinjected bilaterally (1 nmol\/side) into both CA1 and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus in rats that had previously performed the DMTP task.","conclusion":"Bilateral microinjections of Abeta1-40 into the hippocampus resulted in a delayed, but persistent impairment of DMTP performance, which appeared more than 50 days after the injection. Memantine prevented the development of Abeta-induced memory impairment, while donepezil symptomatically alleviated the deficits. Because of a ceiling effect, the combination of donepezil with memantine failed to produce any additive or synergic effects. These results support the clinical data showing that memantine and donepezil are effective for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, it is suggested that memantine is effective for preventing Abeta-induced short-term memory impairment."},{"method":"By comparison to non-transgenic controls, PS1\/I213T KI mice had retarded acquisition of place learning in the Morris water maze without being impaired in the probe trial and in the visible platform subtest. PS1\/I213T KI mice were more likely to display whole-body startle to an auditory stimulus and a tighter grip on a horizontal grid. PS1\/I213T KI mice also had fewer enclosed arm entries in the elevated plus-maze, but did not differ from controls in open-field, photocell actimeter, and T-maze spontaneous alternation tests. No intergroup difference was seen in three motor coordination tests.","background":"Knockin (KI) mice with a PS1\/I213T mutation were compared to wild-type controls on the SHIRPA primary screening battery and for exploratory activity, motor coordination, and spatial learning.","conclusion":"The dissociation between hidden and visible platform versions in the water maze is consistent with the hypothesis that elevated Abeta42 concentrations cause cognitive disturbances."},{"method":"Five-week-old BALB\/c mice were either housed in enhanced social (E) or standard social (S) housing conditions for 2 weeks.

Animals were assessed for activity in an automated individual cage system (LABORAS) and brain neurotrophins analysed.","background":"This study assessed the effects of intermittent individual housing on behaviour and brain neurotrophins, and whether physical exercise could influence alternate individual-housing-induced effects.","conclusion":"Intermittent individual housing increased behavioural activity and reduced nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in frontal cortex; while it increased BDNF level in the amygdala and BDNF protein and mRNA in hippocampus. Besides normalizing motor activity and regulating BDNF and NGF levels in hippocampus, amygdala and cerebellum, physical exercise did not attenuate reduction of cortical NGF and BDNF induced by intermittent individual housing. This study demonstrates that alternate individual housing has significant impact on behaviour and brain neurotrophin levels in mice, which can be partially altered by voluntary physical exercise. Our results also suggest that some changes in neurotrophin levels induced by intermittent individual housing are not similar to those caused by continuous individual housing."},{"method":"Both behavioral and physiological responses were recorded (plus maze and colonic discomfort) at 7 days post-implantation. Corticosterone reduced the exploration of the plus maze and increased colonic distress. The ability of a CRH type 1 receptor antagonist, antalarmin, to block behavioral and colonic effects of central placement of CORT was also examined.","background":"Corticosterone (CORT) micropellets were stereotaxically placed bilaterally at the dorsal margin of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA).","conclusion":"The diminished exploration in the plus maze and colon distress observed in response to CORT placement at the CeA were averted by the administration of antalarmin. These results provide further evidence for the role of the CRH type 1 receptor to ameliorate both behavioral and physiological functions."},{"method":"This study investigated whether early motor improvements after focal cerebral ischemia reflect recovery or compensation. Adult female Wistar rats were trained to retrieve food pellets in a skilled reaching task prior to receiving a unilateral cortical infarction induced by photothrombosis in forelimb motor cortex. Animals were continuously tested in the reaching task up to 3 weeks after lesion.","background":"Initial functional impairments after cerebral ischemia often improve considerably during the early period after the insult. Although pathological changes associated with post-lesion improvements have been widely investigated, it has not been resolved whether behavioral improvement represents true restoration of function (recovery) or development of new strategies (compensation).","conclusion":"The end point measures revealed that reaching success rates remained at pre-lesion levels, however, qualitative analysis of reaching movements indicated permanent changes in forelimb movement patterns. Similar observations were made in a skilled walking task and a test for forelimb asymmetry. These data indicate that lesion animals adopted alternative movement strategies in order to successfully perform the tasks. The changes in postoperative performance were compared to anatomical data in individual animals. The finding that reaching success was not related to lesion size supports the idea that the degree of adaptive behavior after cortical ischemia depends on plastic properties of the remaining intact tissue."},{"method":"In the early phases of training, mutants of all nicotinic lines did not differ compared to wild types in the days to reach criterion when mice were required to nose poke for a sucrose reward on FR1 or FR3 schedules, or in their ability to respond to an auditory clicker to receive a sucrose reward. However, mutants lacking alpha7 nAChRs, but not lines lacking other nAChRs, showed impairments when task difficulty was increased such that an auditory stimulus was presented on a variable schedule and mice were required to withhold their responses until the presentation of the auditory cue to obtain a reward.","background":"Wild-type and mutant mice lacking expression of alpha5, alpha7, beta2, beta3, or beta4 neuronal nicotinic cholinergic receptors (nAChRs) were compared on a signaled nose poke task, a multi-phased task used to measure appetitive learning and impulsivity.","conclusion":"alpha7 mutants were impaired compared to wild types in appetitive learning as measured by the percentage of conditioned responses but overcame their deficits with extensive training for 10 days. However, when efficiency ratios were used to measure impulsivity, alpha7 mutants exhibited lower efficiency ratios even after 10 days of training. These results support a role of the alpha7 nicotinic receptor in mediating appetitive learning and suggest a potential role for the alpha7 nAChRs in the regulation of behavioral disinhibition."},{"method":"In the present study, to investigate effects of chronic maternal stress by the RCS on behavioral and emotional development of the rat offspring (prenatal RCS rats), the RCS stress was loaded to pregnant rats between day 9 and 19 after fertilization.","background":"It has been reported that many types of stresses, which caused physiological and psychological alterations in dams as prenatal maternal stress, affected behavioral and emotional traits of their offspring. However, effects of environmental temperature changes, which induce various stress responses in both animals and humans, have not been assessed as prenatal maternal stress. Repeated cold stress (RCS) is a type of chronic cold stress in which environmental temperature changes rapidly and frequently several times within a day.","conclusion":"The prenatal RCS rats showed similar locomotor activity in an open field to control rats that were borne by non-stressed pregnant rats. On the other hand, the prenatal RCS rats showed significantly higher startle responses than the control rats in a light enhanced startle paradigm. However, treatment of diazepam decreased the startle responses in the prenatal RCS rats to the same degree as those in the control rats. The results indicated that prenatal RCS affected emotional development of the rat offspring, but not locomotor activity. Comparison of the present results with the previous studies suggests that there might be unknown common mechanisms among different prenatal maternal stresses that induce similar behavioral developmental alteration."},{"method":"Control litters (C) were composed by eight pups constantly kept with their mother and fed by a 16%-protein diet ad libitum; protein malnutrition litters (PM) were fed by a 6%-protein diet; protein-calorie malnutrition litters (PCM) were fed with 50% of the 16%-protein diet ingested by C litters; malnutrition by increase in the size of the litter (LLM-number of pups was twice the number of pups in C litters), and malnutrition by separation (SM-litters spent half of the day with non-lactating females). After weaning, all groups received lab chow diet until the test day (70th day). During the test were recorded the basal, avoidance 1, avoidance 2 and escape latencies.","background":"The influence of different malnutrition techniques on the behavior of adult animals was investigated in the elevated T-maze (ETM).","conclusion":"The data showed that PM, PCM, LLM and SM animals showed lower increases in avoidance latencies, when compared to their control groups. However, malnutrition did not affect escape latencies. The nature of these alterations seems to be nutritional, as the extra-nutritional factors (i.e. maternal care) differ a lot among the malnutrition techniques. These results suggest that malnutrition, irrespective of the technique, altered the neural mechanisms believed to control defensive behaviors in the ETM."},{"method":"In our study, an animal model for chronic social stress has been developed for rats using a resident-intruder paradigm. This paradigm is considered a model of social defeat or subordination, and therefore may mimic situations occurring in humans. Rats were subjected daily to subordination stress for a period of five weeks and, in parallel, tested with a battery of behavioural tests.","background":"Stress, especially chronic stress, is one of the most important factors responsible for precipitation of affective disorders in humans. The animal models commonly used in the investigation of stress effects are based mainly on powerful physical stressors. In the majority of cases, these models are not relevant to situations that human beings encounter in everyday life.","conclusion":"Chronically stressed rats showed behavioural changes, including decreased motility and exploratory activity, increased immobility in a forced swim test, and reduced preference for sweet sucrose solution (anhedonia). Reduced locomotor and exploratory activity represents a loss of interest in new stimulating situations, implying a deficit in motivation. Increased immobility in the forced swim test indicates behavioural despair, a characteristic of depressive disorders. Decreased sucrose preference may indicate desensitisation of the brain reward mechanism. Since anhedonia is one of the core symptoms of depression in humans, our findings suggest that the rat chronic social stress model may be an appropriate model for depressive disorders."},{"method":"In order to address this issue, EPM-experienced rats that had received lidocaine, a drug which produces a reversible functional deactivation, intra-dlPAG pre-Trial 1, post-Trial 1 or pre-Trial 2, were systemically injected with the benzodiazepine midazolam and submitted to the EPM apparatus.","background":"Rodents previously (Trial 1) experienced in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) apparatus no longer respond to anxiolytic-like drugs during retesting (Trial 2). In view of the fact that the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG) modulates fear\/anxiety-like behavior, the present study sought to determine its role in this phenomenon.","conclusion":"According to the results, 0.25 mg\/kg midazolam increased open arms exploration and reduced risk assessment behavior, suggesting an anxiolytic-like effect in EPM-naive rats, regardless of the intra-dlPAG treatment. EPM-experienced rats administered with midazolam only displayed a similar pattern of behavior when lidocaine was administered intra-dlPAG pre-Trial 2, but not pre- or post-Trial 1. These effects were observed in the absence of changes in enclosed arms entries, an EPM general exploratory activity index. The present results suggest that an increased activity of the dlPAG during Trial 2 would explain the lack of anxiolytic-like effect of drugs elicited by prior EPM test experience."},{"method":"Random-dot kinematograms were used to generate a pattern of oscillating dots representing four different coherence levels (10%, 30%, 50% and 100%) and one target-alone condition.

The three present studies examine whether dim illumination promotes LDLD-induced splitting (1) by increasing nonphotic feedback during novelty-induced activity bouts, (2) by potentiating nonphotic and\/or photic resetting, or (3) by influencing phase jumping responses under skeleton photoperiods simulating increases in day length.","background":"An endogenous circadian pacemaker uses photic input to synchronize mammalian physiological and behavioral rhythms to the 24 h day. Sunlight during dusk and dawn is thought to entrain the pacemaker of nocturnal rodents, whereas moonlight and starlight are presumed to exert little influence. We show that, to the contrary, dim illumination (&lt;0.005 lux), similar in intensity to starlight and dim moonlight, markedly alters entrainment of hamster activity rhythms.","conclusion":"Experiment 1 illustrates that dim-exposed animals display split rhythms, while animals without dim light do not, despite equivalent activity levels. In Experiments 2 and 3, dim illumination potentiated both nonphotic and photic resetting, and the specific nature of these interactions suggests mechanisms through which dim illumination may alter entrainment under LDLD. Dim light likely promotes LDLD-induced splitting by facilitating both nonphotic resetting and bright light-induced phase jumping in animals entrained to short nights. The actions of dim illumination may be distinct from canonical responses to bright light, and potentially influence the interactions between oscillators comprising the circadian pacemaker."},{"method":"The present study examined expression of these IEGs in the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), caudomedial mesopallium (CMM; formerly cHV), and the hippocampus (HP) in both sexes at d45 in response to conspecific, heterospecific, or no songs.","background":"Male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) begin to sing around 45 days posthatch (d45) and tune their songs to match learned templates. Females never develop song, but they use male conspecific vocalizations for mate choice. While auditory perception is critical for both sexes, the responses of the immediate early genes (IEGs) ZENK and FOS differ in auditory brain areas of d30 males and females.","conclusion":"Overall, zebra finch song presentations resulted in the highest density of ZENK and FOS cells in each region analyzed, but expression varied across brain areas. Contrary to d30 birds, the IEG response patterns did not differ between the sexes. ZENK-immunoreactivity was significantly increased following exposure to conspecific songs compared to no songs, and zebra finch song presentations produced more FOS-immunoreactive nuclei than both heterospecific and no songs. While the pattern was consistent, significant effects of stimulus type were seen only in the NCM when the brain regions were analyzed separately. Furthermore, levels of FOS- and ZENK-immunoreactive neurons were higher in the lateral than medial NCM in both sexes. Along with previous work from our lab and others, these data suggest that at d45 neuronal responses within perceptual regions are still maturing on some levels, but IEG expression has acquired a number of adult characteristics."},{"method":"The present study therefore investigated the behavioural impact of lesioning the corresponding thalamic region (termed Pf) on a range of behaviours present in rodents.

The contribution of such thalamic pathology to disease symptoms has not yet been established.","conclusion":"6-OHDA lesions induced postural (ipsilateral curling and head position biases), sensorimotor (increased latency to respond to tactile stimulation of the contralateral side when eating or grooming) and rotational abnormalities (contralateral circling after apomorphine). The main effects of combined 6-OHDA+Pf lesions were improved performance in a motivational task (decreased latency to retrieve reward) but worsened piloerection, relative to animals with either 6-OHDA or Pf lesions alone. The thalamic zone common to all lesioned animals involved the posterior Pf. Our data suggests that the posterior CM-Pf may be involved in motivational responses and autonomic dysfunction in parkinsonian disorders."},{"method":"The present experiment tested the effects of ILn lesions on a two-lever attention task that required discrimination of visual signals and non-signals. Rats were trained presurgically in the task and then received sham surgery or infusions of n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) into the ILn to induce excitotoxic lesions.","background":"In rats, lesions of the thalamic intralaminar nuclei (ILn) impair measures of working memory, but it is unclear whether alterations of attention contribute to the mnemonic deficits.","conclusion":"ILn lesions transiently decreased accurate detection of signals. ILn lesions also increased omissions. Compared to sham-lesioned rats, ILn-lesioned animals were not differentially affected when task demands were increased by presenting a visual distracter. Finally, a retention interval was incorporated into the task to assess whether the lesions affected acquisition of a working memory version of this behavioral paradigm. Unlike sham-lesioned animals, ILn-lesioned rats did not demonstrate a significant improvement in signal detection when a retention interval was introduced. The transient lesion-induced deficits in the attention task suggest that, in rats, the ILn may contribute to aspects of attentional processing, but through neural re-organization or activity in other regions, there is compensation for the loss of ILn functioning. The ILn appear to be necessary for maintaining performance when working memory demands are increased."},{"method":"LI was measured in a thirst motivated conditioned emotional response procedure with low or high number of conditioning trials, and in two-way active avoidance procedure with the stages of preexposure and conditioning taking place in the same or different contexts.

Lesion to the shell subregion of the NAC disrupted LI but LI was preserved in rats with a combined lesion to the NAC shell and core subregions. Moreover, rats with a combined shell-core lesion persisted in showing LI in spite of high number of conditioning trials and in spite of context change.","background":"Latent inhibition (LI) is the proactive interference of repeated nonreinforced preexposure to a stimulus with subsequent performance on a learning task involving that stimulus. The present experiments investigated the role of the nucleus accumbens (NAC) in LI.","conclusion":"These results show that the NAC is not essential for the acquisition of LI but rather plays a key role in regulating the expression of LI.

Non-startle-eliciting prepulses that are of sufficient intensities to induce reliable PPI are associated with detectable and quantifiable response, confirming that direct evaluation of prepulse-processing is feasible and practical.

Their performance was mostly identical in the same task 1 week later and still distinguishable 8 months later, suggesting the presence of trait or temperamental features. These mice were further tested in other behavioral tasks.","background":"Temperament is the heritable and relatively stable pattern of basic emotions, such as fear and anger.","conclusion":"Compared to low exploratory mice, high exploratory mice were less anxious in the light\/dark task and the elevated plus maze, showed increased locomotion in an open-field, improved their performance along trials in the Lashley maze (with appetitive stimulus) and had higher latency to step-down in the inhibitory avoidance task (with aversive stimulus). High exploratory mice were aggressive in the intruder test, whereas low exploratory mice were non-aggressive or submissive. These results show that individual differences in temperament influence a range of behaviors in mice. The behavioral profile of low and high exploratory mice resembled the depressive and hyperthymic temperaments of patients with unipolar depression and bipolar disorders, respectively, which may be relevant for modeling mood disorders."},{"method":"This was indicated by a decrease in response strength over several days. For the LTH of the acoustic startle response two controls were included: first, developing hearing loss during the time of testing did not account for the startle decrease--only 7 days of acoustic stimulation but not 7 days of adaptation led to a decrease in the startle. Second, repetitive presentation of loud acoustic startle stimuli did not raise the auditory threshold, which might otherwise have accounted for the startle decrease: prepulse inhibition (used here as a hearing test) was identical after both 7 days of acoustic startle stimulation and 7 days without stimulation.","background":"The present study shows that repetitive presentation of tactile and acoustic stimuli evoke long-term habituation (LTH) of the startle response in C57BL\/6J mice.","conclusion":"This proves that LTH to tactile and acoustic stimuli is present and fully functional in mice."},{"method":"After learning, the position of the cones was reversed so that object- and position-specific cues provided contradictory information.","background":"Chicks hatched from eggs incubated in the dark (D-chicks) or from eggs exposed to light during the last 3 days before hatching (L-chicks) were trained on day 4 to peck at small cones for food reinforcement. The cones had different patterns (checked or striped) and were located in different positions (either on the left or on the right of a rectangular arena) so as both object-specific (pattern) and position-specific cues could be used to discriminate cones that contained or that did not contain food.","conclusion":"No effect of light incubation was observed in binocular chicks that chose cones on the basis of object-specific cues. Monocular D-chicks also tended to approach and peck the cones with the correct pattern in the wrong position, whereas monocular L-chicks did not show any clear choice. Initial choices for one side or other of the arena were mostly determined by the first side visible through the non-occluded eye in D-chicks, particularly when using their left eye. These results suggest that light exposure of the embryo makes neural mechanisms that do not receive direct visual input (i.e., those of the occluded side) more available to be used in assessment of novelty."},{"method":"Within each of the two treatment conditions, one-half of the neonates were further individually exposed to relatively novel non-home cages for 3min daily during postnatal days 2-21 (Novel: NAnoxia=20; NControl=16), while the other half remained in the home cage (Home: NAnoxia=19; NControl=19). Emotional reactivity to an open field was evaluated on postnatal day 25 during four 20-s trials.","background":"We investigated in an animal model of neonatal anoxia whether effects of oxygen deprivation on emotional reactivity can be reversed by neonatal novelty exposure, a behavioral method, involving daily 3min away from the home cage for the first 3 weeks of life. Male neonates were exposed to either 100% N2 gas (Anoxia) or room air (Control) for 25min on postnatal day 1.","conclusion":"Among home rats, temporal patterns of open-field activity across multiple trials and initial-trial activity significantly differed between the Anoxia and Control rats. In contrast, these differences were eliminated among the Novel rats. These results show that neonatal novelty exposure, an early-stimulation method that has recently been shown to enhance spatial and social memory, adaptive control of stress response, and hippocampal synaptic plasticity, can also eliminate neonatal anoxia-induced changes in emotional reactivity. These findings suggest that brief and repeated, but mild, changes in the postnatal environment may serve to counteract some of the aversive effects induced by neonatal trauma associated with oxygen deprivation."},{"method":"In this study, we developed a mouse AD model by repetitive administration of Abeta25-35 via a cannula implanted into the cerebral ventricle. Using this administration system, we reproducibly constructed a mouse with impaired spatial working memory.","background":"Amyloid beta (Abeta) is closely related to the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To construct AD animal models, a bolus administration of a large dose of toxic Abeta into the cerebral ventricles of rodents has been performed in earlier studies. In parallel, a continuous infusion system via an osmotic pump into the cerebral ventricle has been developed to make a rat AD model.","conclusion":"In accordance with the occurrence of the abnormal mouse behavior, we found that the number of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neurons was reduced in paraventricular regions of brains of Abeta25-35-administered mice in a dose-dependent manner. Considering that the repetitive administration of a small dose of toxic Abeta via an implanted cannula leads to a brain status more resembling that of the AD patients than a bolus injection of a large dose of Abeta, and therapeutic as well as toxic agents are able to be repeatedly and reliably administered via an implanted cannula, we concluded that the implanted cannula-bearing AD mouse model is useful for development of new AD therapy."},{"method":"Therefore, egr-1, which increases in the lateral nucleus following fear conditioning, footshock and novelty, was assessed to determine if its expression is induced in rats exposed to a cat. Five minutes of cat exposure did not increase expression of egr-1 mRNA in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala.","background":"Research has demonstrated that immediate-early genes\/inducible transcriptional factors (e.g., c-fos, egr-1) are increased in amygdala nuclei (lateral, basal and central nuclei) known to be involved in fear conditioning, footshock stress and novelty. Although these data suggest that expression of inducible transcriptional factors are involved in fear, other non-shock ethologically based paradigms (predator or predator odor exposure) do not appear to increase c-fos in the lateral and basal nuclei. While the lack of c-fos expression may indicate that predator stress does not engage the lateral and basal amygdala nuclei, it may be that c-fos in the amygdala is not responsive to predator exposure.","conclusion":"egr-1 was increased in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, indicating cat-induced stress, and visual cortex compared to rats that were either confined for 5 min or handled. In the lateral periaqueductal gray, handled rats displayed a left hemisphere dominance, which disappeared in both the cat-exposed and confined group, suggesting that immobility, induced by either cat-induced stress or unstressed confinement, increased right hemisphere egr-1 expression. The results are discussed in a context of differences and similarities in neural circuitry for conditioned and unconditioned fear."},{"method":"At adulthood, 43 irradiated and 56 non-irradiated mice were submitted to 3 sessions of the free-swimming rotatory test (diameter of the recipient=21 cm; session duration=5 min; inter-test interval=48 h). The number and direction of 30 degrees and 360 degrees turns were recorded. Animals were classified as side-consistent turners (to the right or to the left) when they did not change their preferred side of rotation in all three sessions and in both turning units.","background":"In order to test the hypothesis that the ontogenetic development of the corpus callosum is related to the establishment of behavioral laterality, the rotatory behavior in the free-swimming test was studied in male Swiss mice with callosal defects induced by exposure to gamma irradiations at the 16th embryonic day (total dose of 3 Gy).","conclusion":"In general our results suggested that irradiated animals present more pronounced laterality than non-irradiated ones. In the irradiated group, the percentage of consistent turners was significantly higher than that of non-consistent turners. In the first session, the percentage of animals that presented strong turning preferences in the acallosal group was higher than in the normal group. In first session, the acallosal group presented a higher average number of turns to preferred side than the normal group. Taken together, our results constitute an endorsement to the hypothesis that the normal development of the corpus callosum is related to the establishment of cerebral laterality."},{"method":"The present experiments test the effect of injections into PH and DMH on theta and hippocampal-sensitive behaviour (FI60 and open field ambulation).","background":"Reduced frequency of theta activity is thought to compromise hippocampal function and so behavioural inhibition. The anxiolytic benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (CDP) reduces theta frequency when injected into the medial supramammillary nucleus (mSuM), posterior hypothalamic nucleus (PH) and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH). These hypothalamic effects on theta could underlie at least some behavioural effects of benzodiazepines. We have previously shown that in a fixed interval 60-s schedule (FI60), CDP injected into mSuM reduced both theta frequency and behavioural inhibition.","conclusion":"Systemic CDP (5mg\/kg i.p.) released, but PH\/CDP (20microg in 0.5microl vehicle) suppressed FI responding, though they both reduced FI theta frequency. In the open field, both CDP i.p. and PH\/CDP reduced ambulation, but only the systemic injection reduced ambulation theta frequency. Taken together with previous research, these results support a role for PH in the control of voluntary behaviour. They imply that this function may be suppressed, independently of theta, by benzodiazepines. An anxiolytic effect of PH\/CDP in FI60 may, therefore, have been masked by a concurrent action of CDP on the PH motor system. DMH\/CDP did not affect behaviour or theta in either experiment, despite the fact that this nucleus is involved in benzodiazepine mediation of risk assessment and the flight response. This suggests that, like the control of theta frequency by the hypothalamus, the neural mechanisms underlying anxiety are distributed in complex networks."},{"method":"LI was measured in an active avoidance procedure. In the first experiment, rats received 100 nonreinforced preexposures and were conditioned either in the same or in a different context from that of the preexposure stage. In the second experiment, rats received 50 nonreinforced preexposures and were conditioned in the same context as that of preexposure.","background":"Latent inhibition (LI) refers to retarded conditioning to a stimulus as a consequence of its nonreinforced preexposure. We have recently reported that basolateral amygdala (BLA) lesions lead to an abnormally persistent LI under conditions that normally disrupt LI, namely, extended conditioning. This study tested whether BLA lesions would induce abnormally persistent LI under two additional conditions disrupting LI in controls, namely, context shift and weak preexposure.","conclusion":"Sham-operated rats showed LI in the same but not in the different context condition or with low number of preexposures. BLA lesions produced abnormally persistent LI with low number of preexposures but not with context shift. It is suggested that the BLA is involved in LI modulation based on the impact of preexposure and conditioning but not on contextual information."},{"method":"Post-training administration of the both systemic (2.5, 5 and 7.5mg\/kg, s.c.) and intra-VTA (5 and 7.5microg\/rat) of morphine, dose-dependently decreased memory retention. The response induced by post-training administration of intra-VTA morphine (7.5microg\/rat) was significantly reversed in morphine-sensitized rats. The inhibition of morphine-induced amnesia in morphine-sensitized rats was decreased by once daily injections of naloxone (0.5, 1 and 2mg\/kg, s.c.), SCH 23390 (0.025, 0.05 and 0.1mg\/kg, s.c.) or sulpiride (25, 50 and 100mg\/kg, s.c.), during the sensitization.","background":"In the present study, the effects of intra-ventral tegmental area (VTA) injections of morphine on memory retention of a one-trial passive avoidance task have been investigated in morphine-sensitized rats. Retrieval was examined 24h after training and used as memory retention. Sensitization was obtained by subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of morphine, once daily for 3 and 5 days free of the opioid before training.","conclusion":"The results suggest that VTA has an important role in morphine-induced amnesia and morphine sensitization affects this process through opioid and dopamine receptors."},{"method":"In four daily 30-min sessions, control and hippocampal rats were exposed to an open circular table under room lighting. Both control and hippocampal rats spent a majority of time near, and organized trips away from, a portion of the table (home base) near a large cue placed proximal to the table. On Day 1, control and HPC rats made equal numbers of head orientations and a comparable number of trips, featuring equal travel distance and numbers of stops.","background":"Prompted by the theoretical prediction that damage to the hippocampus should abolish exploratory behavior, the present study examined exploratory movements in control rats and rats with hippocampal lesions produced with the neurotoxin N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA).","conclusion":"By Day 4, dwell times near the home base increased and other movements decreased in the control rats but the activity profile of Day 1 persisted in the hippocampal rats. The high degree of similarity in behavior between hippocampal and control rats on Day 1 and the persistence of this behavior in hippocampal rats on Day 4 suggests that the hippocampus is not necessary for the display of normal exploratory movements per se. The absence of habituation of exploration in hippocampal rats is discussed in relation to contemporary theories of hippocampal function."},{"method":"In the present study, we analyzed the behavioral effects of environmental complexity on different facets of spatial function, and we assessed dendritic arborisation and spine density in a cortical area mainly involved in the spatial learning, as the parietal cortex. Wistar rat pups (21 days old) were housed in enriched conditions (10 animals in a large cage with toys and a running wheel), or standard condition (two animals in a standard cage, without objects). At the age of 3 months, both groups were tested in the radial maze task and Morris water maze (MWM). Morphological analyses on layer-III pyramidal neurons of parietal cortex were performed in selected animals belonging to both experimental groups.","background":"An enriched environment consists of a combination of enhanced social relations, physical exercise and interactions with non-social stimuli that leads to behavioral and neuronal modifications.","conclusion":"In the radial maze task, enriched animals exhibited high performance levels, by exploiting procedural competencies and working memory abilities. Furthermore, when the requirements of the context changed, they promptly reorganized their strategies by shifting from prevalently using spatial procedures to applying mnesic competencies. In the Morris water maze, enriched animals more quickly acquired tuned navigational strategies. Environmental enrichment provoked increased dendritic arborisation as well as increased density of dendritic spines in layer-III parietal pyramidal neurons."},{"method":"Proliferating cells in the dentate gyrus were labeled by three injections of BrdU during the 24h preceding sacrifice. Early differentiation to neuronal progeny was studied by immunohistochemical staining for doublecortin (DCX), a microtubule binding protein expressed in newborn neurons.","background":"Granular cell proliferation in the adult hippocampus decreases during aging and after chronic stress, while it can be increased by physical activity or treatment with the antidepressant fluoxetine. We investigated whether the physical and cognitive stimulation accompanied by stress in the commonly used Morris water maze affects the rate of proliferation and whether the induced changes can be influenced by antidepressant treatment with fluoxetine.","conclusion":"Acquisition learning in the water maze for 15 days caused a significant decrease in granular cell proliferation in the granular cell layer of the hippocampus. The decrease in the number of BrdU- and DCX-positive cells was reversed to control levels by the use of fluoxetine during the water maze training. Fluoxetine treatment alone increased the number of BrdU-positive cells, but did not increase the number of DCX-positive cells. We conclude that the exposure of adult male rats to water maze acquisition trials is a stressful experience that significantly suppresses the production of new granular cells and that this stressful effect can be blocked by the concomitant administration of the antidepressant fluoxetine."},{"method":"Post-training administration of the potential 5-HT7 receptor agonist AS 19 or antagonist SB-269970 enhanced memory formation or had no effect, respectively. The AS 19 facilitatory effect was reversed by SB-269970, but not by the selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY100635. Amnesia induced by scopolamine (cholinergic antagonist) or dizocilpine (NMDA antagonist) was also reversed by AS 19.","background":"This work aimed to evaluate further the role of 5-HT7 receptors during memory formation in an autoshaping Pavlovian\/instrumental learning task.","conclusion":"Certainly, reservations regarding the selectivity of AS 19 for 5-HT7 and other 5-HT receptors in vivo are noteworthy and, therefore, its validity for use in animal models as a pharmacological tool. Having mentioned that, it should be noticed that together these data are providing further support to the notion of the 5-HT7 receptors role in memory formation. Importantly, this 5-HT7 receptor agonist AS 19 appears to represent a step forward respect to the notion that potent and selective 5-HT7 receptor agonists can be useful in the treatment of dysfunctional memory in aged-related decline and Alzheimer's disease."},{"method":"The present study evaluated the effect of intra-MRN injection of estradiol benzoate (EB) (600 or 1200ng\/0.2microl) on the performance of ovariectomised rats submitted to the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety and to the open-field test.

There is evidence showing that estrogen modulates 5-HT1A receptor functions. In the MRN, somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors control the activity of serotonergic neurones by negative feedback.","conclusion":"The results showed that both doses of EB increased the percentage of entries and the percentage of time spent into the open arms, suggestive of an anxiolytic effect. The highest dose of the drug also increased the number of entries into the enclosed arm and locomotion in the open field, indicating a stimulatory motor effect. WAY 100635 antagonised the effect of estradiol in the elevated plus-maze and in the open-field.

Learning, aggressive behavior, anxiety-like behavior and biochemical correlates of stress were evaluated when Ts65Dn and control mice were 4-5 months old.","background":"Ts65Dn mouse is the most widely accepted model for Down syndrome. We previously showed that environmental enrichment improved spatial learning in female but deteriorated it in male Ts65Dn mice.","conclusion":"Environmental enrichment in large mixed colonies of Ts65Dn and diploid littermates disturbed behavioral and learning skills of Ts65Dn mice in the Morris water maze. ACTH and testosterone levels were not modified in any group of mice. Ts65Dn and control mice subjected to enriched housing in large groups and Ts65Dn mice housed in large groups showed higher corticosterone levels. Aggressive behavior was evaluated by measuring the number of attacks performed in the presence of an intruder. Ts65Dn mice performed less attacks than controls in all conditions, especially after enriched housing, indicating subordination. In the plus maze, cognitive aspects (i.e. risk assessment) and motor components (open arm avoidance) of anxiety behavior were evaluated; no difference in any condition was found. It is suggested that an excess of social and\/or physical stimulation in Ts65Dn mice may affect cognition by disturbing the emotional and behavioral components of the learning process."},{"method":"Using the multiple platform method to produce rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation, we investigated the effect of REM sleep deprivation (REMSD) on motivation for food reward utilizing food-reinforced operant tasks. In acquisition or maintenance of an operant task, REM sleep-deprived rats, with or without simultaneous food restriction, decreased responding for sucrose pellet reward in comparison to controls, despite the fact that all REM sleep-deprived rats lost weight.","background":"Prolonged sleep deprivation in rats produces a characteristic syndrome consisting of an increase in food intake yet a decrease in weight. Moreover, the increase in food intake generally precedes the weight loss, suggesting that sleep deprivation may affect appetitive behaviors.","conclusion":"Furthermore, the overall response deficit of the REM sleep-deprived rats was due to a within-session decline in responding. REM sleep-deprived rats showed evidence of understanding the contingency of the task comparable to controls throughout deprivation period, suggesting that the decrements in responding were not primarily related to deficits in learning or memory. Rather, REM sleep deprivation appears to alter systems involved in motivational processes, reward, and\/or attention."},{"method":"The present study was thus designed to investigate directly the effects of DA on male sexual behavior and to test whether the interaction of DA with heterologous receptors affects this behavior. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of DA or NE inhibited copulation in a dose-dependent manner. Systemic injections of yohimbine, an alpha2-noradrenergic antagonist, modulated copulation in a bimodal manner depending on the dose injected.","background":"In rats, dopamine (DA) facilitates male sexual behavior through its combined action on D1- and D2-like receptors, in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) as well as other brain areas. In Japanese quail, systemic injections of dopaminergic drugs suggested a similar pharmacology but central injections have never been performed. Recent electrophysiological experiments demonstrated that DA effects in the MPOA of quail are mediated mainly through the activation of alpha2-noradrenergic receptors. Previous studies of DA action on behavior used specific dopaminergic agonists\/antagonists and therefore unintentionally avoided the potential cross-reaction with alpha2-receptors.","conclusion":"Interestingly, a behaviorally ineffective dose of yohimbine markedly reduced the inhibitory effects of DA when injected 15min before. Together, these results show for the first time that i.c.v. injections of DA itself inhibit male sexual behavior in quail and suggest that the interaction of DA with alpha2-receptors has behavioral significance."},{"method":"Here, we first established a novel lesion model provoking significant functional impairment of the septo-hippocampal projection system without triggering massive neuronal death in the rat medial septum.

Sildenafil improved the object discrimination performance of Swiss mice at a dose of 1 mg\/kg. Hippocampal slices of Swiss mice incubated with sildenafil (10 microM) increased cGMP levels in varicosities in the CA3 region of the hippocampus and a number of short, thin fibers. Addition of DEA\/NO, an NO donor (10 microM), in the presence of sildenafil (10 microM) strongly increased cGMP immunoreactivity of varicosities in the CA3 region.

In addition, startle response enhancement caused by the anxiogenic drug yohimbine was reduced by perirhinal cortex inactivation.

Recently, we found that prepubertal rats (about 35 days old) from these lines exhibited increased immobility in the swim test, and abnormal social play observed after 24-h isolation. We hypothesized that FSL and WKY prepubertal rats will further show anhedonia in two different behavioral assays: the conditioned place preference test (CPP), examining the rewarding aspect of social interaction and the saccharin preference test. Behavior in the open field paradigm and freezing behavior in the CPP apparatus were also used as measures of anxiety.","background":"One of the most important criteria for major depressive disorder in adults and in children and adolescents as well, is the loss of interest in or pleasure from typically enjoyable experiences or activities: anhedonia.

FSL, and WKY prepubertal rats found social interaction to be rewarding to a similar extent as their control lines, in the CPP test.

While in vivo inhibition of striatal AChE activity was observed only for the highest dose of tacrine, a dose-dependent increase in striatal choline acetyltransferase activity was obtained. Serotonin (5-HT) levels, as assayed following a sensitive HPLC-electrochemical procedure, were significantly increased in nucleus caudatus putamen, nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra, nucleus raphe dorsalis, olivary nucleus and the cerebellum. However, dopamine or norepinephrine levels remained unaltered in these areas of the brain. In animals treated with p-chlorophenylalanine, a specific tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor and 5-HT depletor, tacrine failed to elevate the levels of 5-HT in the brain regions, and significantly attenuated tremor response to the drug. Tacrine-induced tremor was also significantly (83%) attenuated by 5-HT(2A\/2C) receptor antagonist mianserin (5 mg\/kg, i.p.), but methysergide (5 mg\/kg, i.v.) could block tacrine-induced tremor only by 20%.

Treatments (both 1 mg\/kg) were given orally for 6 weeks, and the animals were allowed to self-select food among carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. Food selection was measured throughout the study, and body composition was measured by dissection and weighing of the main organs and tissues. Circulating leptin, insulin and glucose were also assayed at the end of the study on blood collected at the time of carcass analysis.","background":"New antipsychotic drugs often increase weight and produce metabolic disturbances in treated patients.

The anxiogenic-like effect in the plus-maze was not modified by any of the kappa-opioid receptor ligands. Nicotine also induced a significant increase in the corticosterone levels, and the kappa antagonist, which did not exert any effect per se, antagonised this effect.

However, the timing of updating with respect to saccadic eye movements remains a matter of debate.","conclusion":"ERP analysis revealed a significantly larger slow positive wave in the retino-spatial dissonance condition compared to the control condition, starting between 150 and 200 ms after first saccade onset. Source analysis showed an asymmetry with respect to the direction of the first saccade. Whereas the source was restricted to the right PPC in trials with leftward first saccades, left and right PPC were involved in rightward trials. The results of the present study suggest that updating of visual space in a saccadic double-step task occurs not earlier than 150 ms after the onset of the first saccade. We conclude that extraretinal information about the first saccade is integrated with motor information about the second saccade in the inter-saccade interval."},{"method":"Male and female Long-Evans rats were filmed, from both the front and ventral views and their stepping patterns, postural adjustments and forelimb movements, during a successful reach were analyzed.","background":"Sex differences occur not only in the sexual repertoire of animals but also are evident in other aspects of movement. The present study asked whether sexually dimorphic motor behavior extends to the skilled movements used in reaching for food in the rat. Because we have previously shown that males and females are sexually dimorphic in their organization of lateral and rotatory movements and because postural adjustments are incorporated into skilled movements, both body posture and limb movements were examined during a skilled reaching task.","conclusion":"While males and females did not differ in forelimb movements, they were significantly different in how they approached and oriented their body to the food item during a successful reach. These results are discussed in relation to the dissociation of skilled movement from postural adjustments, sex-dependent alterations following CNS injury, and the neural and evolutionary basis of sex differences in movement organization."},{"method":"Microinjection of morphine (5 microg\/0.4 microl) into the ventrolateral PAG produced antinociception in 46 of 85 rats (54%). Subsets of rats with and without morphine antinociception were subsequently injected with bicuculline (2.5, 5, 10, and 25 ng\/0.4 microl) into the same PAG site.","background":"Microinjection of morphine into the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (PAG) disinhibits output neurons resulting in immobility and antinociception. Disinhibition also can be produced by microinjection of the GABA antagonist bicuculline. If morphine and bicuculline disinhibit the same class of neurons, then the behavioral effects evoked should be the same.","conclusion":"Microinjection of bicuculline produced an increase in hot plate latency that was independent of the effect of the prior morphine microinjection. Bicuculline administration also produced an increase in locomotor activity in most rats, not immobility as with morphine microinjections. These differences between morphine and bicuculline microinjections indicate three things: (a) disinhibition of PAG neurons whether by morphine or bicuculline is an effective means of producing antinociception; (b) the circuitry underlying the behavioral effects of morphine and bicuculline differ; (c) the ventrolateral PAG appears capable of supporting a range of defensive behaviors from immobility to flight."},{"method":"We demonstrate that male and female 3-month-old beta estrogen receptor knockout (BERKO) mice show profound memory impairment in a hippocampus-mediated fear-conditioning paradigm.

This report provides the first concrete evidence of significant hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory deficits in the BERKO mouse."},{"method":"Here, STOP knockout and NMDA NR1 hypomorphic mice were assessed in a behavioural measure that can be used to detect schizophrenic-like phenotypes: a change in sensorimotor gating, measured through prepulse inhibition (PPI). STOP knockout mice were further assessed in another measure of 'schizophrenic-like behaviour': hyperlocomotion.","background":"Schizophrenia is a chronic and debilitating disease which is thought to arise from a neuro-developmental disorder. Both the stable tubule-only polypeptide (STOP) protein and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) NR1 subunit are involved in neuronal development and physiology. It has therefore been postulated that transgenic mice lacking either the STOP or the NMDAR1 gene would show a 'schizophrenic-like' phenotype.","conclusion":"The PPI deficit exhibited by both the STOP knockout and NMDA knockdown mice could not be reversed by acute treatment with the atyptical antipsychotic, clozapine (1 mg\/kg, i.p.) but the hyperlocomotion shown by the STOP knockout mice was reversed with the same acute dose of clozapine."},{"method":"The present experiment evaluated the influence of different prepulse and pulse intensities upon the expression of PPI by additionally taking into account individual differences in startle reactivity. To this end, we subdivided a cohort of 102 mice into three subsets of equal size differing in startle responsiveness, and evaluated PPI using three levels of prepulse stimulus in combination with three intensities of pulse stimulus.","background":"Using the acoustic startle reflex, prepulse inhibition (PPI) is typically demonstrated by the interaction between two auditory stimuli presented in close temporal proximity. When a startle-eliciting pulse stimulus is shortly preceded by a weak prepulse stimulus, the reaction to the former is attenuated in comparison to when the pulse stimulus is presented alone.","conclusion":"Our results revealed additive as well as complex interactive effects amongst individual's reactivity, pulse intensity and prepulse intensity. At the same time, additional issues concerning the quantification of PPI are highlighted, especially when startle reactivity differs considerably between comparison groups. We concluded that the variation in pulse intensity represents a valuable addition to PPI assessment in general, and especially in genetically modified mice."},{"method":"In a first experimental condition, non-arbitrary, unambiguous stimuli were used as S1 to enable the subjects to prepare their responses.

Two preparatory stimuli cued unequivocally each for one response. In contrast, a third preparatory stimulus cued for two response alternatives which appeared for the same ratio (each in 50% of all trials) introducing response competition.","conclusion":"Button presses after unambiguous, non-arbitrary preparatory stimuli activated the right middle frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobe if S1 was associated with a definite response. When the subjects did not know the S1-S2 relation, left prefrontal cortex activation was associated with trials including definite responses. Performing the same S1-S2 response condition after subjects knew their relation right prefrontal and left parietal areas became additionally engaged. However, in the first experimental condition using unambiguous, non-arbitrary stimuli and in the third, \"aware\" experimental condition when S1 was coupled with two response alternatives, the anterior cingulate cortex was activated. As these experimental conditions have in common, that the preparatory stimulus shares information about the upcoming competing response alternatives they highlight the evaluative role of the anterior cingulate cortex for competing actions."},{"method":"Postanoxic behavioural disturbances were recorded in open-field, elevated plus-maze, and sudden silence tests when the rats reached the age of 4 month. Moreover, spontaneous motor activity of the rats was recorded radiotelemetrically in their home-cages.","background":"Alertness was studied in adult male Wistar rats after neonatal critical anoxia applied under three different thermal conditions: (i) at physiological neonatal body temperature of 33 degrees C, (ii) at body temperature elevated to 37 degrees C, and (iii) at body temperature elevated to 39 degrees C (both during anoxia and for 2 h postanoxia). To elucidate the effect of iron-dependent postanoxic oxidative damage to the brain, half of the group (iii) was injected with deferoxamine, a chelator of iron.","conclusion":"Both open-field stress-induced and spontaneous motor activity were reduced in rats subjected to neonatal anoxia under hyperthermic conditions. In contrast, these rats were hyperactive in the plus-maze test. Both the plus-maze and sudden silence tests revealed that these rats show reduced alertness to external stimuli signalling potential dangers. The behavioural disturbances were prevented by the body temperature of 33 degrees C and by postanoxic administration of deferoxamine. These data support the conclusion that permanent postanoxic behavioural disturbances are due to iron-dependent oxidative damage to the brain, which can be prevented by the reduced neonatal body temperature."},{"method":"These \"very fast visual rhythms\" (VFVRs) consist of two brief successive trains, a first one of low amplitude preceding the saccade onset, and a second one, much larger, during the saccade itself.","background":"We analyse a particular class of fast electrocortical rhythms that occur in a limited part of the primary visual cortex (BA 18) during eye saccades in behaving cats placed in a lit environment. Their high frequency (50-132 Hz) contrasts with that of two other classes of rhythms recorded in the same cortical area, the 25-45 Hz visual rhythms (40 Hz) that we previously showed to accompany sustained focused attention, and the alpha rhythms (approximately 10 Hz), that occur in situations of rest.","conclusion":"The possibility is considered, that the first train subtends a presaccadic attention shift, and the second, a change of gaze towards a new target through the interception saccade.

Paroxetine (4 mg\/kg), citalopram (8 mg\/kg), venlafaxine (8 mg\/kg), and milnacipran (8 mg\/kg) administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) increased the number of punishments accepted by mice in the FPT. Clonidine (0.0039-0.5 mg\/kg) and guanabenz (0.03-0.5mg\/kg) had no effect on the number of punishments accepted by mice. Clonidine (0.03 and 0.06 mg\/kg) and guanabenz (0.125 and 0.5 mg\/kg) (i.p. -45 min) reversed the anti-punishment effect of paroxetine, citalopram, venlafaxine and milnacipran (i.p. -30 min). But if the antidepressants are administered 45 min before the test and alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists 30 min before the test, alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists failed to alter the anti-punishment effect of antidepressants.","background":"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin\/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) has been reported to be efficient in anxiety disorders. Some animal models have demonstrated an anxiolytic-like effect following acute administration, however, it is not yet known how noradrenergic receptors are implicated in the therapeutic effects of antidepressants (ADs) in anxiety.","conclusion":"The results of this present study indicate that alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists antagonise the anxiolytic-like effect of antidepressants in mice when they are administered 15 min before the administration of antidepressant suggesting a close inter-regulation between noradrenergic and serotoninergic system in the mechanism of SSRIs and SNRIs in anxiety-like behaviour."},{"method":"Loss and recovery of normal behaviour was followed by video analysis of animal performance in an appetitive behavioural test. When compared to 13 control (unoperated) animals, the appetitive response of freshly sectioned animals is normal initially, progressively deteriorates up to 40 days after the lesion, and then gradually improves until 60 days, when recovery is complete. This is true only when one of the leading arms in the appetitive test is a sectioned arm; turning the starfish so that both the leading arms facing the prey are unlesioned, results in normal behaviour even at 40 days after the cut.","background":"The starfish Asterias rubens is an invertebrate deuterostome whose nervous system shows remarkable regenerative properties. To understand when full functionality of a damaged part of the nervous system recovers, and to follow nerve regeneration in detail, we carried out behavioural experiments with 29 starfishes that had the nerve in one of the arms sectioned in a mid-arm position.","conclusion":"Thus, regeneration is a multi-step process whose time course coincides with anatomical regeneration.

Groups that were housed enriched, however, were less helpless. Furthermore impoverished conditions did not increase the vulnerability in single housed animals.","background":"Structural and social factors are known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of depression. Since animal models of depression are a major tool to gain insights into the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of this disease it is important not only to exploit but also to be aware of factors that may affect these models.

When rats were intraorally infused with quinine HCl (QHCl) solution, a significant increase in hypothalamic histamine release was observed. On the other hand, histamine release was decreased by sucrose and saccharin solutions. When rats were conditioned to acquire taste aversion to sucrose solution or saccharin solution, instead of the histamine decrease seen by the palatable solutions, the pattern of histamine release was similar to that seen by QHCl solution.","background":"Our previous study indicated that taste information via the chorda tympani (CT) activates the central histaminergic system in anesthetized rats.

In parallel, using a permanently implanted cortical electrode, we measured electroencephalogram signals (EEG) to quantify the time spent in W, SWS and PS.","background":"Recent data have suggested that the activity of various brain nuclei is modulated during sleep. In this context, we developed the idea that sleep may participate in adapting brain responsiveness to feeding, so as to tune the control of peripheral energy metabolism.","conclusion":"Analysis of EEG changes in relation to the changes induced in body composition, showed that (1) the amount of sleep (PS and SWS) followed the evolution of energy supply levels, and (2) the time spent in PS relative to SWS varied to a considerable degree (14-23.5%) and followed the same trend as the ratio of lean body mass to fat mass.

After 100 days of consumption, each group received two consecutive intrahippocampal (dorsal CA1) injections. First injection: nicotine (4.6 microg, 20 mM) or saline; second injection: PregS (5 ng, 24 microM), AlloP (0.2 microg, 1.26 microM) or saline. Following the injections, novelty-directed activity (open field, OF), and motor coordination (80 degrees inclined screen) were tested. Blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) were assessed.","background":"Considerable evidence suggests that the anxiolytic effects of ethanol may be one of the factors that promotes alcohol consumption.

Alcohol intake increased the novelty-induced ambulation and exploration of central areas, and decreased defecation. The high exploration levels induced by AlloP decreased significantly over sessions, indicating a rapid habituation to the environmental conditions. Motor coordination was deteriorated by ethanol consumption. These results demonstrate the effects of chronic alcohol intake and neurosteroid administration on anxiety-related behaviours, and suggest an important role of the hippocampal GABA(A) receptor in these behaviours."},{"method":"Therefore, in the present study, we have measured the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on specific behavioral tasks in adult offspring whose mothers were treated with cocaine (3mg\/kg, twice a day, E16-E25).

We also evaluated a different memory task with a more robust attentional component, using spontaneous alternation in a Y maze.","background":"Our laboratory has previously characterized a rabbit model of gestational cocaine exposure in which permanent alterations in neuronal morphology, cell signaling and psychostimulant-induced behavior are observed. The cellular and molecular neuroadaptations produced by prenatal cocaine occur in brain regions involved in executive function and attention, such as the anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices.","conclusion":"In this task, young adult rabbits exposed to cocaine prenatally exhibited a significant deficit in performance. Deficits in spontaneous alternation can be induced by a wide variety of behavioral and cognitive dysfunctions, but taken together with previous findings in this and other animal models, we hypothesize that prenatal exposure to cocaine alters highly specific aspects of cognitive and emotional development."},{"method":"I.c.v. administration of non-hyperalgesic doses of ryanodine (0.001-0.06 nmol per mouse i.c.v.), an antagonist of ryanodine receptors (RyRs), dose-dependently prevented the antinociception induced by both physostigmine (100-150 microgkg(-1) s.c.) and oxotremorine (40-70 microgkg(-1) s.c.).

There was no correlation between the number of individual Eigenmannia detected at recording sites and electric organ discharge frequencies. Further, Eigenmannia apparently do not maximize the frequency differences between conspecifics. In laboratory studies fish were preferentially observed in aggregates of two fish or more.

There was a decrease in both Tb and LMA by the third week after the MS lesion. It can, therefore, be concluded that the MS lesion affected the initiation of SWS, as there was a decrease in the frequency of SWS episodes. Study of S-W in the rats that were given freedom to select Tamb helped to demonstrate the role of the MS in the inhibition of PS. It also showed that the thermostat of the rats was reset at a lower level by the third week after the MS lesion.

Both post-shock and retention levels of freezing were unaffected in rats that received RU 38486 in the DH compared to vehicle controls; however, vehicle rats also displayed low levels of freezing during retention.

Besides that, the pre-treatment of animals with l-arginine (a nitric oxide (NO) precursor, 750 mg\/kg, intraperitoneal, i.p.) or sildenafil (a specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, 5 mg\/kg, i.p.) prevented the anti-depressant-like effect of all K+ channel inhibitors. The present results demonstrate that the decrease in the immobility time in the FST elicited by the inhibition of several subtypes of K+ channels is also dependent on the inhibition of NO-cGMP synthesis."},{"method":"Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered a single injection of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at 14 days old and were compared, when they reached adulthood, with neonatally saline-treated controls in several behavioural tests of unconditioned fear and anxiety.","background":"Neonatal exposure to an immune challenge has been shown to alter many facets of adult physiology including fever responses to a similar infection. However, there is a paucity of information regarding its effects on adult behaviours.","conclusion":"There was no effect of the neonatal treatment on performance in either the elevated plus maze, modified Porsolt's forced swim test or the open field test. However, neonatally LPS-treated rats did show significantly reduced exploration of novel objects introduced to the open field arena, indicating an effect of the neonatal immune challenge on behaviours relating to anxiety in the adult."},{"method":"Compared to unstressed rats, those exposed to CUMS showed significantly less weight gain with age, decreased consumption of (and preference for) sucrose without a change in total fluid consumption. Exposure to CUMS significantly reduced open-field exploration, rearing and grooming indicative of lethargy, apathy and bodily neglect, respectively. Brain MAO-A and MAO-B activity were both significantly increased in the stressed rats.","background":"Brain-pancreas relative protein (BPRP) is a novel protein whose biological function remains unknown. Here, we report a possible role of BPRP in male rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) to induce depression for 3 weeks.","conclusion":"These results verified induction of depressive symptoms by CUMS. The stressed animals showed a significant reduction in pancreatic BPRP, which was accompanied by an increase in levels of blood sugar and a decrease of insulin. But they showed no apparent alteration in levels or distribution of BPRP in the hippocampal formation, which nevertheless displayed a thinner dentate granule cell layer perhaps related to elevated MAO-B activity. These findings suggest that stress-induced reduction of pancreatic BPRP may cause diabetic symptoms. Whether those symptoms in turn contribute to the onset of depression requires further study."},{"method":"This study evaluated the potential of a lateralised nose-poking task for detailed assessment of the deficit in rats with complete unilateral and partial nigrostriatal terminal lesions induced by unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) or striatum, respectively. To maximise the task's potential for revealing chronic deficits, a version of the task that requires rats to nose-poke away from visual stimuli associated with food rewards was used. Because of its low stimulus-response compatibility, performance of this version is not mediated by the rats innate tendencies, and thus, is less likely to spontaneously recover after partial lesions.","background":"Experimental therapies for Parkinson's disease are commonly validated in unilateral rat lesion models using simple tests of motor asymmetry such as rotation. However, the human disorder is considerably more complex than this, and alternative tests that yield a more relevant evaluation of the lesion-induced deficit could provide a powerful behavioural tool for analysis of novel therapies.","conclusion":"Two weeks and 4 months after lesion surgery, both groups of lesioned rats developed an ipsilateral responding bias with a corresponding drop in contralateral accuracy. Rats with complete (but not partial) lesions also developed a deficit in attempting trials, reacting to stimuli requiring a contralateral nose-poke and executing movements bilaterally. This experiment suggests that the version of the lateralised nose-poking task requiring an arbitrary stimulus-response association may be a powerful behavioural tool for assessment of complete or partial dopamine lesions, and any subsequent dopamine replacement strategy."},{"method":"Here we show that this new test is sensitive to different types of anxiety in rats, including drugs (pentylenetetrazole)-induced, light-induced and socially induced (encounter with an unfamiliar male) anxiety, as assessed by reduced Suok test horizontal, vertical, directed exploration and stops.","background":"Exploration of the long elevated alley (the rat Suok test) enables behavioural characterisation of anxiety, activity and neurological phenotypes in rats.","conclusion":"High anxiety also leads to higher motor incoordination (as assessed by the number of falls and hind-paw slips), suggesting that this test may be used for combined profiling of anxiety, motor-vestibular anomalies and anxiety-induced motor incoordination in rats. This new behavioural paradigm may be widely used in neurobehavioural stress research, including modelling of stress-evoked states and pharmacological screening of psychotropic drugs."},{"method":"For this purpose, spatial and motor abilities were evaluated in 6- and 20-week-old male and female mice, and the immune status of these behaviorally tested mice was assessed by the presence of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAbs) in the serum.","background":"In the systemic autoimmune\/inflammatory lupus erythematosus disease, the involvement of the central nervous system is well recognized and frequently includes deficits in neurological function, cognition, and affect. The (NZW x BXSB)F1 lupus-prone mice are model of this pathology, in which a gene located on the Y chromosome provokes a sex specific morbidity in males. The present study examines whether autoimmune (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice develop impairments in learning and memory that correlate with severity of lupus-like disease.","conclusion":"The results showed that none of the animals had motor skill and motor learning disabilities, but that the older males were greatly impaired in their spatial abilities while the young ones and the females, whatever their age, were not. Besides, the ANAbs levels were similar and low in the young males, the young females and the old females, and very much higher in the old males, showing that spatial alterations were correlated to the anti-nuclear antibodies level."},{"method":"Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to a circular corridor for 30 min to assess reactivity to novelty and to the elevated plus-maze and the light-dark tests as measures of anxiety and morphine CPP was then studied (three pairings with 5 mg\/kg s.c. morphine and three with saline).","background":"Reactivity to novelty has been related to operant drug self-administration but does not seem involved in the conditioned place preference (CPP). To further assess this issue our aims were to investigate: (1) the importance of the initial versus delayed activity in the novel environment to predict the CPP induced by morphine; (2) the separate contribution of trait anxiety in morphine CPP.","conclusion":"Delayed activity in the corridor (16-30 min) correlated positively with CPP score, whereas the initial activity (0-15 min) did not. High-responders (HR), those more active during the second half of the corridor, developed morphine CPP in contrast to low-responders (LR). Also, HR and LR did not differ in anxiety nor any plus-maze or light-dark test measure correlated with CPP behaviour. Enhanced vulnerability to develop morphine CPP is predicted by a higher delayed activity in a novel environment, regardless of anxiety."},{"method":"To remedy this, we tested adult humans with ADHD that were primarily inattentive (ADHD\/I) or combined inattentive\/hyperactive (ADHD\/C) and controls with the Attention Network Task that assesses both reflexive and voluntary attention and explicitly tests nonspatial cueing.","background":"Recent pharmacological studies in animals and neuroimaging studies in normal humans suggest that the spatial and nonspatial cues in tasks measuring reflexive attention may be modulated by different neurotransmitter systems. The efficiency with which attention is oriented to explicit spatial cues may be altered by manipulating levels of brain acetylcholine, whereas reactions to nonspatial cues may be influenced by altering brain noradrenaline levels but not acetylcholine levels. In humans, however, previous attention studies have implicated dopamine when either explicit or implicit cueing is used. Some of the differences between animal and human work may be due to inadequate testing of nonspatial cues.","conclusion":"Our results showed that spatial orienting in both subtypes was no different than controls. However, ADHD\/C but not ADHD\/I subjects had significantly slowed response times to nonspatial cues and cues with spatial conflict. Stimulant medication in a subset of ADHD\/C subjects reduced these deficits to control levels. Based on these results, we conclude that ADHD\/C subjects orient the focus of their attention normally but are impaired in their reactions both to abrupt visual cues and those that contain conflicting spatial cues."},{"method":"We modified the task by introducing four wide arms into the circular tank and adding features that reduced, eliminated, or compensated for several competing behaviors. Three versions of the 4-arm task were evaluated in detail, and the third version yielded good results for six of eight inbred strains. Furthermore, the 4-arm task could be scored adequately without computerized video tracking.","background":"The submerged platform or Morris water escape task is widely used to study genetic variation in spatial learning and memory, but interpretation is sometimes difficult because of wall hugging, jumping off the platform, floating or non-spatial swim strategies.","conclusion":"Although performance on the 4-arm task was generally superior to the Morris maze, the extent of the improvement was strain dependent. Two strains with retinal degeneration (C3H\/HeJ, FVB\/NJ) performed poorly on both the Morris and 4-arm mazes, whereas C57BL\/6J and DBA\/2J did well on both mazes. A\/J performed poorly on the Morris task but became very proficient on the 4-arm maze, despite its strong tendency to hug the walls of the tank. The BALB\/cByJ strain, on the other hand, exhibited the best probe trial performance on the Morris maze but was very slow in acquiring the 4-arm task. We conclude that no single task can reveal the full richness of spatially guided behavior in a wide range of mouse genotypes."},{"method":"One group of rats was tested every 24h during the first 5 days (D1-D5) post-EC. Two other groups were tested for the first time in the LMA boxes on D3 and D6 post-EC and their performance was compared with the group tested on D1 (activity in a novel environment).","background":"Behavioural habituation to a novel environment is a simple form of learning in rodents. We studied the habituation and locomotor activity (LMA) of Wistar rats subjected to unilateral, transient (30min) extradural compression (EC) of the right sensorimotor cortex.","conclusion":"Total and center locomotion, vertical activity and time spent in the center of the LMA box were reduced on D1 post-EC and normalized by D2. The EC-induced motor paresis was undetectable on the rotarod by D2 and on the beam-walking by D3. Total locomotion, vertical activity and time spent in the center of EC-rats significantly increased from D1 to D3. EC caused neurodegeneration in the cortex, caudate putamen and thalamus as detected by Fluoro-Jade staining. The size of the cortical damage decreased from D2 to D5 in the medial and caudal regions of the compressed hemisphere, in accordance with recovery of motor function. LMA provided additional information in the follow-up of recovery from brain injury and habituation to the environment. Thus, long-term, inter-session habituation was impaired from D1 to D3 but dissociated from increased LMA intra-session on D3, when the motor deficits provoked by EC were already undetectable in the rotarod and beam-walking tests."},{"method":"Therefore, the present experiment aimed at investigating whether eye orientation induces a decision bias in favour of the ipsilateral hemispace. Participants were asked whether or not they suspected subliminal electrocutaneous shocks, whereas no subliminal stimulation was actually delivered. A secondary visual task led participants to direct their eyes ipsi- or contralateral to the stimulated area. Differences between experimental conditions in the amount of subliminal shocks participants acknowledge to receive (number of positive responses) are thought to reflect decision biases. Low and high trait anxiety participants were involved.","background":"Lateral shifts in overt attention have been previously shown to modulate reaction times to lateral electrocutaneous stimuli, as well as perception or unpleasantness thresholds. A response bias can play a role in the elicitation of these lateral differences.","conclusion":"Results showed an interaction between the eye orientation and the tested hand. The number of positive responses was smaller in right-hand tests with contralateral eye orienting. This effect fits those described previously with real electrocutaneous stimuli. This interaction is related to hemispheric differences in spatial attention. In contrast to thresholds studies, this study failed to replicate that a lateral difference arises in the low but not in the high trait anxiety individuals, suggesting that this interaction was mostly due to the neurosensory processing of the electrocutaneous stimuli."},{"method":"To determine whether the visual stimulus of a courting male modifies song-induced expression of the IEG ZENK in the auditory forebrain we exposed male and female zebra finches to acoustic (song) and visual (dancing) components of courtship. Birds were played digital movies with either combined audio and video, audio only, video only, or neither audio nor video (control).","background":"Sensory driven immediate early gene expression (IEG) has been a key tool to explore auditory perceptual areas in the avian brain. Most work on IEG expression in songbirds such as zebra finches has focused on playback of acoustic stimuli and its effect on auditory processing areas such as caudal medial mesopallium (CMM) caudal medial nidopallium (NCM). However, in a natural setting, the courtship displays of songbirds (including zebra finches) include visual as well as acoustic components.","conclusion":"We found significantly increased levels of Zenk response in the auditory region CMM in the two treatment groups exposed to acoustic stimuli compared to the control group. The video only group had an intermediate response, suggesting potential effect of visual input on activity in these auditory brain regions. Finally, we unexpectedly found a lateralization of Zenk response that was independent of sex, brain region, or treatment condition, such that Zenk immunoreactivity was consistently higher in the left hemisphere than in the right and the majority of individual birds were left-hemisphere dominant."},{"method":"At the age of 16-20 weeks, these animals were tested for emotional behavior using an elevated plus-maze and fear-sensitized acoustic startle response.","background":"In the present study, newborn rats were implanted with corticosterone (CORT) containing polymers at postnatal day 0 (releasing rate 320-80 microg CORT\/kg body weight and day). Controls received a CORT-free implant. All implants were removed at postnatal day 12.","conclusion":"On the elevated plus-maze significant differences were found between hormone treated and control animals. The CORT-group demonstrated higher numbers of entries into closed arms and all arms, and the time spent in the center of the maze was significantly enhanced. Hormone-treated and control rats showed a significant fear sensitization of the acoustic startle response. However, no significant differences were observed between the two groups. The number of CRF-immunopositive neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala was decreased after CORT treatment, whereas the number of NPY-immunopositive neurons and total number of neurons in the amygdala did not differ significantly between both groups. In conclusion, early postnatal stress induced by CORT administration in neonatal rats led to a higher locomotor activity correlated with changes in the number of CRF containing neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala."},{"method":"Here, cells in both the habenula and IPN were recorded in freely moving rats while they foraged for food pellets.","background":"The habenula and interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) are part of a dorsal diencephalic conduction system which receives input from cholinergic, striatal, and hypothalamic areas, and sends output to several, disparate midbrain regions. These output regions include the dorsal tegmental nucleus, which is part of a navigation-related system that provides a signal for directional heading. The habenula and IPN also project to the dorsal and medial Raphe nuclei, thought to be involved in mood and behavioral state regulation.","conclusion":"There were four major findings. First, many of the cells tended to fire in sporadic bouts of relatively high versus low rates, and this may be related to intrinsic cell properties discovered during in vitro studies. Second, although these regions are connected to the direction signaling circuit, they do not, themselves demonstrate a directional signal. Third, about 10% of the cells in the lateral habenula showed a strong correlation between rate and angular head motion. This may constitute an important, requisite input to the above-mentioned head direction circuit. Finally, many of the cells in each region showed a temporally coarse correlation with running speed, so that bouts of high frequency firing coincided with episodes of higher behavioral activation. This last finding may be related to work which shows an influence of the habenula on locomotor activity, and in relation to the protective effects of exercise in relation to stress, as mediated by the Raphe nuclei."},{"method":"We tested the effect of two models of repeated intraspecific agonistic interaction in mice. No influence was observed over the glutathione levels in the mice cerebral cortex, cerebellum, liver, and blood. Acute restraint stress in rats was found to induce an increase in glutathione levels in the cerebellum after 2 and 4 h of immobilization, an effect not observed in the cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. To investigate the interference of an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), N(omega)Nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester (L-NAME, 50 mg\/kg) was applied i.p. at the beginning of restraint stress. L-NAME alone did not lead to a change in glutathione levels although, in combination with restraint stress, it induced an increase in such levels. This effect was observed in all four structures studied, i.e. cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum.","background":"Glutathione is the major non-protein thiol to which many different roles in the central nervous system (CNS) are attributed. To further investigate the glutathione response in the CNS, we tested the effect of three stress models on glutathione levels in the brain.","conclusion":"The values returned to basal levels after 6h of immobilization. In conclusion, the pattern of dominance, after repeated intraspecific agonistic interaction, was ineffective in producing alterations in brain glutathione, whereas acute restraint stress led to an increase in glutathione levels within a window of 2-4 h, and the inhibition of NOS increased glutathione levels in all studied rat brain structures, suggesting a specificity interference of acute restraint stress with the glutathione system."},{"method":"In this work, we have searched for potential behavioral differences between Wistar-Zagreb 5HT rat sublines in three anxiety paradigms: hole-board, zero-maze, and social interaction test.","background":"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) plays important roles in both embryonic development as a mediator of neurogenesis and in the mature brain as a neurotransmitter. Disturbances in serotonergic transmission have been indicated in several psychiatric disorders. In the search for the biological substrates of psychiatric diseases, studies using animal models represent complementary approaches to studies on human subjects. Wistar-Zagreb 5HT rats, with constitutionally upregulated\/downregulated platelet 5HT transporter (termed high- and low-5HT rats, respectively), have been developed in our laboratory as a model for studying various aspects of 5HT function.","conclusion":"In all three tests, significant differences in behavior between Wistar-Zagreb 5HT sublines have been observed, indicating higher levels of anxiety-related behavior in high-5HT rats. In the social interaction test, high-5HT animals spent less time in active contact with conspecifics and displayed a narrower spectrum of social behaviors than their low-5HT counterparts, while in the zero-maze and hole-board tasks, they showed a lower level of exploratory activity (head dips and nose pokes) in comparison to low-5HT rats. On the other hand, thigmotactic behavior (the percentage of time spent in open quadrants of zero-maze and the percentage of central holes visited in hole-board) did not differ between the sublines. The results suggest that as a result of selection process, a specific component of anxiety-related behavior (i.e. exploratory activity directed towards a novel environment and conspecifics) has been affected in Wistar-Zagreb 5HT rats."},{"method":"Here, we tested the effect on hole board habituation of haloperidol (Hal, 0.075 mg\/kg, i.p.), risperidone (Ris, 0.2 mg\/kg, i.p.) and the mGluR5 agonist CHPG (0.1 mg, i.c.v.) after subchronic treatment.","background":"Neurocognitive impairment has consistently been considered a central and stable feature of schizophrenia. There is much controversy about the effects of neuroleptics on neurocognitive deficits. Thus, further investigations are needed to clarify the pathological substrate of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia as well as to identify pharmacological tools for treatment. Transient prenatal Vitamin D deficiency is considered a developmental model in schizophrenia research. Recently, it was reported that prenatal Vitamin D-depleted rats showed a habituation deficit in the hole board.","conclusion":"Hal was found to impair habituation in control animals, Ris restored hole board habituation, whereas Hal and CHPG normalised hole board habituation in the deplete animals completely. The results of the study demonstrate that (i) the Vitamin D model might be a valuable tool in the study of neurodevelopmental aspects of schizophrenia, (ii) the model is sensitive in detecting the effect of antipsychotic drugs and (iii) the model appears to be sensitive in differentiating between typical and atypical antipsychotic drug."},{"method":"Here we characterize circulating plasma concentrations of testosterone and 11-KT in socially dominant (territorial) and socially subordinate (non-territorial) males.","background":"In vertebrates, circulating androgen levels are regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis through which the brain controls the gonads via the pituitary. Androgen levels ultimately depend on factors including season, temperature, social circumstance, age, and other variables related to reproductive capacity and opportunity. Previous studies with an African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, suggested that changes in both testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), an androgen specific to teleost fish, depend on male social status.","conclusion":"Territorial males have significantly higher circulating levels of both forms of androgen, which is another defining difference between dominant and subordinate males in this species. These results underscore how internal and external cues related to reproduction are integrated at the level of the HPG axis."},{"method":"Although pre-test administration of different doses of histamine and clobenpropit showed no effect on impairment of memory induced by pre-training morphine, when the above drugs were co-administered with morphine, they inhibited the restoration of memory by morphine.","background":"The effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of ultra low doses (ULDs) of histamine, clobenpropit and pyrilamine are studied on morphine state-dependent (STD) memory in mice.","conclusion":"These effects were opposite to microgram doses of the same drugs."},{"method":"Event-related potentials (ERP) of the bimodal stimulant peppermint oil were recorded in 34 healthy subjects (17 women).","background":"Most odorants we experience in every day life are bimodal in that they activate both the main olfactory and the intranasal trigeminal system.

The aim of the study was to address sex-dependent hemispheric differences in olfactory event-related potentials.","conclusion":"No sex-related differences in olfactory sensitivity, trigeminal sensitivity or hedonic ratings of the stimuli were found. Although perceived similarly by men and women, results indicated a sex-differentiated hemispheric response to bimodal odors. Women generally expressed larger amplitudes and longer latencies over their left hemisphere, whereas men demonstrated a similar pattern over their right hemisphere. This effect was most evident for the early sensory derived ERP components indicating a sex-dependent difference in the sensory processing of bimodal odors."},{"method":"Transient global ischemia was induced in adult male rats under general anaesthesia administered by artificial respiration to prevent respiratory arrest. Systemic blood pressure was reduced to below 50 mmHg by instant adjustments of the halothane concentration, before and during bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries. Cerebral blood flow was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry. Dying neurons were detected by TUNEL at 14 days after ischemia and surviving neurons by NeuN at 14 and 125 days after ischemia. Learning and memory was assessed in a novel water maze with three successive left-right choices.","background":"The pyramidal CA1 neurons of the hippocampus are critically involved in spatial learning and memory. These neurons are especially vulnerable to cerebral ischemia, but in spite of this, it has been consistently difficult to show any learning and memory deficits in two-vessel occlusion models of global ischemia.","conclusion":"Transient global ischemia produced a profound and selective degeneration of CA1 neurons at 14 days after ischemia. This degeneration was associated with severe impairments in learning at 13 days after ischemia and in memory, as tested 24 h afterwards. At 125 days after ischemia, there was no significant learning and memory impairment, whereas the number of CA1 neurons was increased. These results show that transient global ischemia induced by two-vessel occlusion may lead to severe, but transient, impairments in learning and memory using a novel water maze, and that restored learning and memory is associated with an increased number of CA1 neurons."},{"method":"We show here that a single injection of estradiol (500 microg\/kg) rapidly and transiently activates copulatory behavior in castrated male quail pre-treated with a dose of testosterone behaviorally ineffective by itself.

The preoptic area--hypothalamus (HPOA), hindbrain, telencephalon and cerebellum were isolated and monoamines measured by HPLC-ED.","background":"Steroids are generally viewed as transcription factors binding to intracellular receptors and activating gene transcription. Rapid cellular effects mediated via non-genomic mechanisms have however been identified and one report showed that injections of estradiol rapidly stimulate chemoinvestigation and mounting behavior in castrated male rats. It is not known whether such effects take place in other species and what are the cellular underlying mechanisms.","conclusion":"Estradiol increased levels of the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and 5-HIAA\/serotonin ratios in the telencephalon and hindbrain independently of whether animals had mated or not. Estradiol also affected these measures in HPOA and cerebellum but this effect was correlated with the level of sexual activity so that significant effects of the treatment only appeared when sexual activity was used as a covariate. Interactions between estradiol effects and sexual activity were also observed for dopamine in the HPOA and for serotonin in the hindbrain and cerebellum. Together, these data demonstrate that a single estradiol injection rapidly activates male sexual behavior in quail and that this behavioral effect is correlated with changes in monoaminergic activity."},{"method":"Male Swiss mice were exposed to different conditions of illumination for one week prior to testing.

Our goal was to evaluate the influence of manipulations of the light\/dark cycle on the basal anxious behaviour of mice and the efficacy of two anxiolytic treatments in the mouse elevated plus maze (EPM).","conclusion":"The locomotor activity of control mice and the anxiolytic efficacy of diazepam in the EPM were not affected by manipulation of the light\/dark cycle. Conversely, the effects of WAY 100635, which were qualitatively different from those of diazepam, seemed to be influenced by the illumination conditions imposed before the test. We can conclude that diazepam's effect, which is characterized by a strong \"disinhibition\", was more robust than the 5-HT(1A) antagonist's effect, which was more anxioselective. Moreover, the light conditions imposed on mice before the test may be an important factor in the variability of the response to serotonergic but not to benzodiazepine treatments."},{"method":"The present work was designed to investigate whether the antidepressants amitriptyline (30 mg\/kg), maprotiline (25 mg\/kg), and fluoxetine (15 mg\/kg) produce SDL of the inhibitory avoidance conditioning in male and female CD1 mice.

SDL makes it possible to separate the effects of drugs per se on learning from the effects due to changes in drug state during the task.","conclusion":"The results do not show SDL in any of the drugs. In the case of amitriptilyline, the data can be attributed to a memorization deficit, while the maprotiline results are interpreted as simultaneously influenced by memorization deficit and performance facilitation due to motor impairment. Fluoxetine treatment did not produce any deteriorating effect on the conditioning. Drugs had some different effects on the performance of males and females, males showing a slightly higher deterioration than females with administration of amitriptyline and maprotiline. This study shows that these antidepressants affect the acquisition\/consolidation but not the retrieval process in the inhibitory avoidance learning."},{"method":"Increased level of anxiety was found only in audiogenic susceptible rats both from WAG\/Rij and Wistar strain, but increased level of depression was found only in WAG\/Rij rats independently of their susceptibility to audiogenic seizures.","background":"Some rats of the WAG\/Rij (Wistar Albino Glaxo from Rijswijk) and Wistar strain are susceptible for audiogenic (convulsive) seizures.

Strain-dependent performance in behavioral and cognitive tasks is well-documented. Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), an activity-dependent enhancement of synaptic transmission that may underlie some forms of learning and memory has been shown to differ significantly between inbred mouse strains.

Neuronal loss was assessed by Fluoro Jade B (FJB) staining of nucleus accumbens and the CA2\/CA3 region.","background":"Spontaneous development of lupus-like disease in MRL-lpr mice is accompanied by a constellation of behavioral deficits, including blunted responsiveness to sucrose. Although autoimmunity-induced damage of limbic areas is proposed to underlie this deficit, the systemic nature of the disease precludes inference of a causal relationship between CNS damage and functional loss.","conclusion":"While control mice significantly increased intake of sucrose solutions 60 min after administration of AMPH (i.p., 0.5 mg\/kg), the intake in drugged MRL-lpr mice was comparable to those given saline injection. Increased FJB staining was detected in the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus of diseased mice, and AMPH treatment neither altered this nor other measures of organ pathology. The results obtained are consistent with previously observed changes in the mesolimbic dopamine system of MRL-lpr mice and suggest that the lesion in the nucleus accumbens and deficits in dopamine release underlie impaired responsiveness to palatable stimulation during the progress of systemic autoimmune disease. As such, they point to a neurotransmitter-specific regional brain damage which may account for depressive behaviors in neuropsychiatric lupus erythematosus."},{"method":"In the current study, a highly selective, systemically administered CRH1 antagonist (CP154,526) failed to reverse global ischemia-induced cell death in hippocampal CA1 neurons or spatial memory impairments as assessed in the radial arm maze. Similarly, central administration of alpha-helical CRH failed to confer protection against ischemic damage.","background":"Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) has been implicated in ischemia-induced neurotoxicity, due in part to excitatory effects at the hippocampus, and the demonstrated neuroprotective effects of centrally administered, non-specific CRH antagonists. However, a number of issues remain to be clarified from these studies, including the relative contribution of CRH receptor subtypes, and the efficacy of these compounds to alter ischemia-induced behavioral impairments.","conclusion":"Interestingly, CRH1 antagonism reversed ischemia-induced hyperactivity in a novel open field, suggesting that modulation of this behavior is independent of effects on hippocampal CA1 cell loss. Failure of the current study to demonstrate neuroprotective effects of either the selective or non-selective CRH antagonists tested challenges the proposed neurotoxic role of CRH in global ischemia.

Litters were fostered at birth to untreated dams and, at adulthood, male offspring underwent five successive daily encounters (15 min each) with a standard opponent of the same strain, sex, weight and age. The encounters on day 1, 3 and 5 were videotaped and agonistic and non-agonistic behavioural items finely scored.","background":"The long-term effects on isolation-induced aggressive behaviour and central NGF and BDNF levels of gestational exposures to ozone (O(3)) were evaluated in adult CD-1 mice.","conclusion":"O(3)-exposed mice showed a significant increase in freezing and defensive postures, a decrease in nose-sniffing behaviour and reduced progressively the aggressive behavioural profile displayed on day 1. Reduced NGF levels in the hippocampus and increased BDNF in the striatum were also found upon O(3) exposure."},{"method":"Here, we report on an experiment in which providing additional structuring to the standard condition, favoring either further spatial grouping or perceptual\/visual clustering of subsets of holes, tremendously facilitated nose poke discrimination learning in normal C57BL\/6 mice.","background":"In order to study spatial cognition as well as operant\/instrumental conditioning or attention processes in the same experimental context in mice, we have designed and constructed an operant chamber that contains a large number of nose poke holes distributed over its inner walls. The nose poke holes were placed three in a horizontal row on one left wall, five in a form of an X on the front wall, and three in a vertical column on one right wall in a hexagonal shaped chamber. This organization of nose poke holes was intended to provide mice with spatially structured environmental cues.","conclusion":"More interestingly, mice were able to use their (spatial or mental) representation of holes organization elaborated under spatially or visually structured environment, to improve their learning of a new discrimination under the standard less-structured environment. These findings support the idea that mice are sensitive to subtle visual background information, in addition to spatial information, to organize nose poke items, process similar to both pattern separation and chunking process, in order to minimize interference and to increase items discriminability and their capacity for (long-term) memory."},{"method":"In this study, we evaluated the effects of emotional content on declarative memory, utilizing an adaptation of two versions of the same story, with different arousing properties (neutral or emotional), which have been already employed in experiments involving the enhancing effects of emotions on memory retention. We used event related potentials (ERP) to evaluate whether there is a sex-related hemispheric lateralization of electrical potentials elicited by the emotional content of a story. We compared left and right hemisphere P300 waves, recorded in P3 and P4 electrode sites, in response to emotional or neutral stimuli in men and women.","background":"Several studies suggest that emotional arousal can promote memory storage.","conclusion":"In the left hemisphere, emotional stimuli elicited a stronger P300 in women, compared to men, as indexed by both amplitude and latency measures; moreover, the emotional content of the story elicited a stronger P300 in the right hemisphere in men than in women. The better memory for the arousal material may be related to the differential P300 at encoding. These data indicate that both sex and cerebral hemisphere constitute important, interacting influences on neural correlates of emotion, and of emotionally influenced memory."},{"method":"We investigated the effects of PR deletion on the sensitivity of sexual behavior to dopamine antagonism in male wild-type (WT) and progesterone receptor knockout (PRKO) mice and found that WT mice were more behaviorally sensitive to the effects of dopamine D1 receptor blockade.","background":"Progesterone receptor (PR) activation can modulate the expression of male sexual behavior, both acutely in adulthood as well as during development, through long lasting effects on neural differentiation. One mechanism by which PR activation may affect behavior, during either epoch of life, is through alterations of the dopaminergic system.","conclusion":"There were also genotype differences in tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactivity (TH-ir) in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) as well as genotype differences in how TH expression changed in response to social and sexual experience. In particular, in the VTA, sexually experienced PRKO mice had significantly more cells expressing TH than sexually experienced WT mice. In the SNc, experienced PRKO males had significantly more cells expressing TH than naive PRKO males. Thus, it appears that PR deletion affects the display of sexual behavior and its modulation by dopamine, as well as the differentiation of dopaminergic cells and the plasticity of those cells in response to social environment and behavioral experience."},{"method":"All dogs were immunised with rabies vaccine. IgG anti-rabies antibody response was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) test. Serum IFN-gamma and IL-10 levels were measured by ELISA in animals showing significant individual left-, right- or no-paw preferences in the behavioural test.","background":"The production of specific antibodies (IgG), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was evaluated in dogs in relation to behavioural lateralisation as assessed by paw preference. Left-handed, right-handed and ambidextrous dogs of mixed breed were selected on the basis of their performance in a task consisting of the removal of a piece of adhesive paper from the snout.","conclusion":"The results showed that the direction of behavioural lateralisation influenced the immune response in dogs. The titers of anti-rabies antibodies were lower in left-pawed dogs than in right-pawed and ambidextrous dogs. Similarly, the IFN-gamma serum levels were lower in left-pawed dogs than in right-pawed and ambidextrous dogs. IL-10, on the contrary, seemed to be an immune parameter, which was not affected by lateralisation. These findings suggest that immunomodulation can be correlated with brain laterality in canine species by the regulation of the production of antibodies and some cytokines like IFN-gamma, which are molecules involved in the immune-neurohumoral crosstalk."},{"method":"This study investigated the changes in 5-HT release and turnover in the hippocampus evoked by acute and repeated exposure to an inescapable stressor, an elevated open platform, and compared them to the changes evoked in the frontal cortex. Repeated exposure to this stressor results in habituation of the plasma corticosterone response to the test, with full habituation being observed after 20 trials. Repeated exposure to the stressor for 5 or 10 occasions increased 5-HT turnover in the hippocampus. By contrast, 5-HT turnover in frontal cortex was increased by acute exposure to the stressor. Microdialysis studies showed that acute stress increased 5-HT overflow in prefrontal cortex but not dorsal hippocampus whereas repeated daily (10 days) exposure to the stressor increased basal extracellular 5-HT in the dorsal hippocampus, but not the prefrontal cortex. Prior exposure to the stressor on up to 10 occasions enhanced the plasma corticosterone response to a challenge in an elevated plus-maze performed 24h later whereas repeated, but not acute, exposure to the stressor, elicited anxiolytic-like behavioural responses in this test.","background":"Increased psychophysiological resistance to chronic stress has been related to increased 5-HT release in the dorsal hippocampus.","conclusion":"It is concluded that acute exposure to this form of inescapable stress selectively stimulates the 5-HT projections to the frontal cortex; repeated stress elicits a sustained increase in 5-HT release and turnover in the hippocampus. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that increased 5-HT release in the hippocampus may be implicated in the mechanisms underlying habituation to inescapable stress."},{"method":"Although both patients and controls demonstrated initial facilitation for valid versus invalid cues following the shortest SOA, and a performance decrement (inhibition of return), at the longest SOA, a clear differentiation between these groups was found for the intermediate SOAs. Unlike controls, where IOR manifested between 350 and 1000 ms, IOR was evident as early as 150 ms for HD patients. Further, the benefit of valid cueing correlated significantly with the level of impairment. Although patients exhibited poor fixation, principally attributable to saccadic intrusions, they were capable of appropriately suppressing a purely stimulus-driven response to the cue. A similar proportion of erroneous saccades to the cue were generated by both groups prior to stimulus onset, also correlating significantly with level of impairment.","background":"A non-predictive peripheral cueing paradigm was used to evaluate visuospatial attentional deficits in symptomatic HD patients, employing spatially valid and invalid visual cues over a range of stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) to elicit a saccadic response.","conclusion":"These results are discussed with respect to neural processes implicated in spatial cueing and within the context of reduced inhibitory activity of the BG in HD."},{"method":"Wistar rats were daily handled with a brief maternal separation, maternal separated for 3 h or left undisturbed during the first 10 days of life.

The behavioural effects of early handling could not be explained by changes in the density of midbrain dopaminergic cells, which were not affected by handling or maternal separation."},{"method":"The anxiety levels of peripubertal male Sprague-Dawley rats (43 days old) were characterized using open field and elevated plus mazes, followed by chronic restraint stress for 6 h\/day\/21 days beginning in young adulthood (75 days).

However, in the 4 h version of the Y-maze, chronically stressed high anxiety rats showed impaired spatial memory, while chronically stressed low anxiety and control (low and high anxiety) rats displayed intact spatial memory. Moreover, a month after chronic stress ended, high anxiety rats had significantly higher basal corticosterone levels than low anxiety rats (control and stress). These results indicate that peripubertal anxiety and chronic stress interact to influence hippocampal-dependent spatial memory in adulthood."},{"method":"Subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of different doses of morphine sulphate (0.5-6 mg\/kg) produced a dose-dependent CPP. Using a 3-day schedule of conditioning, it was found that intra-CA1 administration of the anticholinesterase, physostigmine (2, 4 and 8 microg\/rat) significantly potentiated the morphine (0.5 mg\/kg)-induced CPP. Moreover, intra-CA1 administration of the muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine (1, 4 and 7 microg\/rat) inhibited the morphine (6 mg\/kg)-induced CPP dose-dependently. On the other hand, atropine (7 microg\/rat, intra-CA1) reversed the physostigmine-induced potentiation of the morphine response. Furthermore, intra-CA1 administration of nicotine (0.5, 0.75 and 1 microg\/rat) with an ineffective dose of morphine (0.5 mg\/kg) elicited a significant CPP. Bilateral injections of different doses of the nicotinic receptor antagonist, mecamylamine (2, 4 and 8 microg\/rat) into the CA1 regions significantly inhibited the morphine (6 mg\/kg)-induced CPP. Moreover mecamylamine (8 microg\/rat, intra-CA1) decreased the effect of nicotine-induced potentiation of the morphine response.

Male Long-Evans rats received 30 min daily access to 0.3 M sucrose solution or water over nine consecutive days, followed by nine daily injections of quinpirole (0.5 mg\/kg, s.c.) or saline. Locomotor activity was assessed using an automated open-field system.","background":"Sensitization of dopaminergic neural reward circuits has been hypothesized to be involved in the development of drug addiction. Highly palatable foods activate these same brain areas, specifically the nucleus accumbens.","conclusion":"Locomotor sensitization developed, as quinpirole-treated rats traveled significantly more, and exhibited a greater number of movements than saline controls. A characteristic pattern of an initial suppression of locomotor activity, followed by excitation of activity was observed in quinpirole-treated rats. Pre-exposure to sucrose attenuated the initial suppression of activity, and facilitated excitation of activity. Rats that were pre-exposed to sucrose exhibited a reduced suppression of activity as compared to rats pre-exposed to water. Rats receiving sucrose and quinpirole also displayed a significantly greater enhancement of locomotor activity as compared to rats receiving water and quinpirole. These results support the hypothesis that highly palatable foods can alter the same neural reward circuits as drugs of abuse, and may facilitate sensitization-related addiction. This may aid in further understanding the neural basis of eating disorders."},{"method":"Therefore, the present study examined the effects of temporary inactivation of the medial and basolateral amygdala on TMT-induced freezing. Temporary inactivation was accomplished by local injections of the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol into the areas of interest.","background":"Trimethylthiazoline (TMT) is a component of fox feces and is thought to be a stimulus with innate fear-eliciting properties for rodents. Naive laboratory rats that are exposed to TMT display freezing behavior, a known behavioral sign of fear and anxiety. Early studies examining the neural basis of TMT-induced fear showed that the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis is important for this behavior. In contrast, the central and lateral nuclei of the amygdala does not seem to participate in the neural processing of TMT-induced fear. However, a study investigating c-fos expression in response to TMT-exposure revealed a strong activation of the medial as well as a weak activation of the basolateral amygdala.","conclusion":"TMT-induced freezing was completely blocked by temporary inactivation of the medial amygdala. Temporary inactivation of the basolateral amygdala resulted in a delay of the onset of the freezing response to TMT. These results clearly demonstrate that the medial amygdala is crucial for TMT-induced freezing, whereas the basolateral amygdala seems to play a modulatory role in this type of fear behavior. Since the medial amygdala is also involved in the processing of cat odor-induced fear, the finding of the present study points towards a general role of the medial amygdala in the processing of predator odor-induced fear."},{"method":"In order to explore the in vivo functional significance of SGK3 in the regulation of spatial learning and exploratory behavior, we assessed the performance of SGK3 knockout mice (SGK3-\/-) and their wild type littermates (SGK3+\/+) in a place navigation task in the water-maze, radial maze in a battery of forced and free exploration tests, acoustic startle and a test for motoric coordination.","background":"The serum and glucocorticoid inducible kinase isoform SGK3 is expressed in the brain including hippocampal neurons. It is activated by phosphoinositide-3 (PI3) kinase and thus a putative target of neurotrophic factors. In vitro experiments pointed to the ability of SGK3 to regulate several transporters and ion channels including the AMPA receptor GluR1.","conclusion":"According to water-maze and radial maze testing reference and working memory was intact in SGK3-\/- mice. However, detailed analysis of swimming patterns of SGK3-\/- mice in the water-maze revealed a deficit in precision and goal-directed navigation in space. SGK3-\/- mice showed reduced exploratory activity, which was observed in several environments and increased centre field avoidance in the open-field. SGK3-\/- mice further showed reduced darting behavior on open surfaces, indicating that the knock out may modify basic patterns of locomotion.

Importantly, the behavioural phenotype of the Y(1) receptor knockout mice is circadian rhythm-dependent and also influenced by stimuli such as restraint stress. In addition, we found evidence for increases in working memory. Taken together, these findings suggest an important role of Y(1) receptors in the regulation of motor activity, exploration, and anxiety-related behaviours.

By day 5, the dominant-subordinate relationship was firmly established and there were differences in behavior over time. Chases, bites and retreats were all less frequent on day 5 of the social interaction than on day 1.

All groups acquired the fear conditioned response similarly on the training day.","background":"Hibernation is a unique and highly regulated physiological state characterized by profound, albeit periodically reversible, depression in body temperature, metabolism, and consciousness. Hippocampal synapses undergo pronounced remodeling in concert with torpor and arousal. During hibernation, the number of postsynaptic densities, apical dendritic branches, and spine densities decreases substantially in the hippocampus. Upon arousal these parameters increase beyond pre-hibernation levels and peak within 2-3h. By 24h after arousal, dendritic parameters remain elevated but have started to subside, consistent with pruning and differentiation.","conclusion":"During a subsequent retention test session, AGS in the 24h group exhibited enhanced expression of contextual fear compared to the other two groups. These data suggest that the morphological and biochemical changes occurring at 24h after arousal from hibernation affect hippocampal-dependent learning and memory.

This impairment was almost completely reversed by merely switching to a standard protein (20% casein) diet on the 10th day after the start of PM. However, the reversal was not observed when the switching to a standard protein regimen was done on the 15th day of the PM diet.

Thus, PCP enhanced grooming expression indiscriminately. However, this behavior had to serve both hygienic and stress managing purposes in order for chain sequencing to become disorganized as a consequence of drug treatment.

In the working memory task, lesioned animals were permanently impaired in their ability to solve the delayed-matching-to-position task. This working memory deficit is not related to increased proactive interference. It could be related to impairment of the rats ability to reorganize spatial stimuli. Consequently, rats were not able to achieve an optimal performance level to solve spatial tasks with continuous changes in the place location. In the elevated T-maze, lesioned rats reduced passive avoidance response but no changes in the escape response were observed.

There were no differences in consumption between HA and LA mice. Our results indicated that mice that presented a more intense novelty-seeking behavior increased their preference for nicotine during the free choice experiment but that anxiety levels did not predict nicotine consumption.

Naltrindole (0.5 mg\/kg, delta-subtype-selective) and nor-binaltorphimine (0.5mg\/kg, kappa-subtype-selective) were inactive in both administration schedules.

Rats treated with the NMDA antagonist ketamine (5 mg\/kg) before the forced swimming or the second post-stress assessment of nociception did not have hyperalgesia. Thus, swim stress-induced hyperalgesia might be initiated by the repeated stimulation of mu-opioid and NMDA receptors but maintained only by the activity of NMDA receptors."},{"method":"Male rats were trained to lever press for oral alcohol reinforcement in a distinctive context. Responding was then extinguished in a context with different olfactory, visual and tactile properties. Placement of the rats back into the original context in which they self-administered alcohol induced, in the absence of alcohol availability, a significant increase in lever press responding on the alcohol lever as compared to extinction levels of responding. The ability of the alcohol context to support alcohol-seeking behavior was maintained over 3 weeks, with no significant diminution. A second group of rats was trained to lever press for sucrose reinforcement; this group also demonstrated context-dependent reinstatement, although the degree of reinstatement decreased over repeated tests, returning to extinction values after 3 weeks.","background":"The environment in which alcohol consumption occurs may trigger later relapse in alcohol abusers. In this study, we tested whether an alcohol-associated environment would induce alcohol-seeking behavior.","conclusion":"These findings indicate that contextual conditioning has a long-term impact on ethanol-seeking behavior after ethanol withdrawal. This animal model may be useful to study the neural mechanisms underlying relapse induced by ethanol-associated contexts in humans."},{"method":"In this study, the effects of KT-95 were investigated in an acetic acid-induced writhing test and scopolamine-induced memory impairment test using spontaneous alternation performance in a Y-maze and a step-down type passive avoidance test. Male ddY mice were treated with KT-95 (0.24-2.35 micromol\/kg, s.c.) 30 min before the behavioral test. In the writhing test, the antinociceptive effect of KT-95 (2.35 micromol\/kg) was completely antagonized by nor-BNI (4.9 nmol\/mouse, i.c.v.), but not by naloxone (3.05 micromol\/kg, s.c.).","background":"3-Acetoxy-6beta-acetylthio-10-oxo-N-cyclopropylmethyl-dihydronormorphine (KT-95) is a synthesized compound that binds to mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptors in vitro. KT-95 induces analgesia and this effect is antagonized by nor-BNI, a selective kappa-opioid receptor antagonist. We have reported that kappa-opioid receptor agonists improve impairment of learning and memory in mice and\/or rats.","conclusion":"KT-95 significantly improved the impairment of spontaneous alternation induced by scopolamine (1.65 micromol\/kg, s.c.). The ameliorating effect of KT-95 was not antagonized by nor-BNI, but was almost completely antagonized by a selective sigma-receptor antagonist, N,N-dipropyl-2-[4-methoxy-3-(2-phenylenoxy)-phenyl]-ethylamine monohydrochloride (NE-100, 2.6 micromol\/kg, i.p.). KT-95 also significantly improved scopolamine-induced learning and memory impairment in the passive avoidance test, although the effect was partial. Administration of KT-95 itself induced impairment of learning and memory. KT-95-induced impairment was not antagonized by naloxone, naltrindole, nor-BNI or NE-100 indicating that this impairment was not because of opioid receptor stimulation. These results suggested that although the KT-95-induced antinociceptive effect was mediated by kappa-opioid receptors, the KT-95-induced improvement in scopolamine-induced impairment of memory was mediated mainly via sigma-receptors and partially by kappa-opioid receptors."},{"method":"Microinjections of relatively low doses of IL-2 into the dorsal PAG significantly facilitated defensive rage behavior elicited from the medial hypothalamus.","background":"Feline defensive rage is a form of aggression occurring in nature in response to a threatening condition and is elicited under laboratory conditions by electrical stimulation of the medial hypothalamus or midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG). Since it has recently been shown that cytokines can modulate neurotransmitter release, the present study was designed to determine the effects of administration of interleukin 2 (IL-2) into the PAG upon defensive rage elicited from the medial hypothalamus.","conclusion":"The specificity of this phenomenon was supported by the following findings: (1) IL-2 induced effects were dose- and time-dependent, (2) the facilitative effects of IL-2 could be completely blocked by pre-treatment of the injection site with either anti-IL-2 or anti-IL-2 receptor antibody and (3) IL-2 administration into the PAG showed no effect upon another form of aggression, namely predatory attack, elicited from the lateral hypothalamus. The findings further demonstrated that the effects of IL-2 were mediated by an NK(1) receptor mechanism since pre-treatment of the PAG with an NK(1) receptor antagonist completely blocked the facilitating effects of IL-2. Immunocytochemical observations supported these findings by demonstrating an extensive pattern of labeling of IL-2Ralpha in the dorsal PAG. The present study thus demonstrates that IL-2 in the dorsal PAG potentiates defensive rage behavior and is mediated through an NK(1) receptor mechanism."},{"method":"For this purpose, we recorded a group of 25 female subjects who slept for at least two consecutive nights in the laboratory. The post-sleep waking EEG was compared to the one recorded during the presleep wakefulness from four midline derivations (Fz-A1, Cz-A1, Pz-A1, Oz-A1).","background":"The aim of the present study was to characterize the regional electroencephalographic substratum of the awakening process by means of a Hz-by-Hz EEG spectral power analysis.","conclusion":"Results indicated that the first 10 min after awakening are characterized by an increase of EEG power in the low-frequency range (1-9 Hz) compared to the corresponding presleep waking period, and by a significant decrease of EEG power in the beta range (18-24 Hz). As regards topographic differences, the increase of EEG power upon awakening in the delta-theta range showed a parieto-occipital prevalence. Moreover, the occipital derivation showed a larger decrease of power in the beta range as compared to the other derivations. In conclusion, the EEG substratum of the sleep offset period is characterized by a pattern of increased EEG power in the delta-theta and low-alpha bands, and of decreased power in the beta range. This pattern could be considered as the spectral EEG signature of the sleep inertia phenomenon. The state of post-sleep EEG hypo-arousal does not subside in the first 10-min period after awakening considered in the present analysis. Finally, according to our results, the more posterior scalp locations show stronger EEG signs of sleep inertia, and could be the last ones to properly wake up."},{"method":"Two well-validated tests of anxiety, the open-field and elevated plus-maze, were used on 40-day-old pups.","background":"Animal models have been used in understanding the neuro-biological basis of depression and predicting successful treatment strategies. The current study focused on two genetic models of depression, the Flinder's Sensitive Line (FSL) and Wister-Kyoto (WKY). Our laboratory showed depressive symptomatology in pre-pubertal WKY and FSL rats, and the current study focused on the strains' anxiety-like traits. Since human depression-anxiety comorbidity is very common at young ages, it is essential to establish whether FSL and WKY pre-pubertal rats also exhibit such comorbidity. In addition, the effect of different rearing environments was studied using a mild chronic-stress condition (limiting available bedding between post-natal days 2-9).","conclusion":"FSL pups exhibited lower anxiety-like behavior when compared to controls, in traditional open-field and plus-maze measures. A different pattern was observed in the WKY strain, which exhibited heightened anxiety-like behaviours in the FSL strain and affecting WKY's body-weight. Overall, the findings indicate differential expression of anxiety in pre-pubertal rats belonging to the 'depressed' strains, suggesting that these strains may be suitable for modelling different sub-groups of depression at young ages."},{"method":"The objective of this study was to assess spatial memory as measured by performance of male SHR, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats on a win-shift version of the water radial arm maze.","background":"The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is a commonly used animal model of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Previous literature is inconclusive with respect to the exact nature of memory impairments in this strain.","conclusion":"On this task, all strains made more errors on Trial 4 when the mnemonic demand was highest, and showed a similar response when the delay was increased from 60s to 2h on Week 3. Both SHR and WKY rats made more reference memory errors than SD, however, SHR showed minimal improvement over weeks. The increase in errors may be due to a greater inclination of SHR and WKY to use a chaining strategy of entering consecutive arms than SD. Furthermore, the number of incomplete arm entries into reference memory arms decreased over weeks in WKY and SD, but increased in SHR, suggesting increased impulsivity of SHR at the later stages of testing. Although based on number of errors, the data indicate that SHR may have memory deficits, the data relating to arm entries suggest that the minimal improvement in SHR over weeks may have been due to greater impulsivity in the later weeks, rather than defective memory. Thus, these findings are consistent with SHR having impairments with selection of appropriate behavioural responses in a goal-directed task."},{"method":"Here, we investigated the effects of administration of a specific agonist of adenosine A(1) receptor (N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine; CPA) on nociception, anxiety, exploratory response, locomotion and brain oxidative stress of hyperthyroid rats. Hyperthyroidism was induced by daily intraperitoneal injections of l-thyroxine (T4) for 14 days. Nociception was assessed with a tail-flick apparatus and exploratory behavior, locomotion and anxiety were analyzed by open-field and plus-maze tests. We verified the total antioxidant reactivity (TAR), lipid peroxide levels by the thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) reaction and the free radicals content by the DCF test.","background":"Adenosine acting on A(1) receptors has been related with neuroprotective and neuromodulatory actions, protection against oxidative stress and decrease of anxiety and nociceptive signaling. Previous studies demonstrated an inhibition of the enzymes that hydrolyze ATP to adenosine in the rat central nervous system after hyperthyroidism induction. Manifestations of hyperthyroidism include increased anxiety, nervousness, high O(2) consumption and physical hyperactivity.","conclusion":"Our results demonstrated that CPA reverted the hyperalgesia induced by hyperthyroidism and decreased the exploratory behavior, locomotion and anxiety in hyperthyroid rats. Furthermore, CPA decreased lipid peroxidation in hippocampus and cerebral cortex of control rats and in cerebral cortex of hyperthyroid rats. CPA also increased the total antioxidant reactivity in hippocampus and cerebral cortex of control and hyperthyroid rats, but the production of free radicals verified by the DCF test was changed only in cerebral cortex. These results suggest that some of the hyperthyroidism effects are subjected to regulation by adenosine A(1) receptor, demonstrating the involvement of the adenosinergic system in this pathology."},{"method":"Animals were divided into four groups: The control group did not undergo any specific treatment. The second group consisted of animals that were agitated for an hour with a glass rod at an irregular speed. The third group contained animals showing aggressive behavior during an hour of monitoring, i.e. documented territorial hostility by raising of dorsal fins and pursuit of intruders. In contrast to these three groups, which had last been fed 24h earlier, the fourth group included animals that had been nourished 1h prior to sacrifice.","background":"The effects of three types of behavior on c-fos activation in different brain regions of the mudskipper, Periophthalmus cantonensis, were studied by immunocytochemistry.","conclusion":"Results showed that, in most brain regions of control animals, there were relatively few c-fos positive cells. After fish had been agitated, however, very prominent c-fos label was seen in the lateral and medial parts of the telencephalon, the thalamus, hypothalamus, pituitary and medulla. In aggressive fish, a significant increase in the number of c-fos positive sites, as compared to control fish, was observed in the diencephalons, pons and medulla, but not in the telencephalon. After feeding, there was a less substantial increase in c-fos protein expression in the diencephalon, but an even more prominent c-fos activation in the pons and medulla. Our present results support the hypothesis that, in fish, the medial telencephalon is involved in avoidance reaction and the lateral telencephalon in spatial memory, whereas rhombencephalic activation may reflect activity of cranial nerve nuclei."},{"method":"In this study, we present a new transgenic mouse model with a prominent over-expression of the 5-HT(1A) receptor in the outer cortical layers (I-III) and the dentate gyrus. Behavioural studies revealed a slight decrease in baseline motor activity of homozygous mice during the open field test. Moreover, core body temperature of male transgenic mice was significantly lower than that of wild-type mice. Pharmacological studies with the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.1-2.5 mg\/kg, i.p.) revealed an exaggerated drug response in mutant mice. 8-OH-DPAT led to a drastic decrease in motor activity in the open field and elevated plus maze test. This significant effect on motor activity became more apparent by investigating the serotonergic syndrome induced by 8-OH-DPAT. Concentration as low as 0.5 mg\/kg 8-OH-DPAT caused immobility in transgenic mice for 30 min, head weaving behaviour, and backward walking, whereas in wild-type animals, typical behaviours of the serotonin syndrome were first observed at concentrations of 1.5 mg\/kg and more.","background":"The serotonin 1A (5-HT(1A)) receptor is one of the best described receptor subtypes of the serotonergic system. Due to the complex distribution pattern, the pre- and postsynaptic localisation, the impact on various monoamines, as well as the influence on a wide range of physiological functions, the contribution of 5-HT(1A) receptors to behavioural outcomes is difficult to define.","conclusion":"In addition, the 8-OH-DPAT induced hypothermia was more pronounced in mutant mice than in wild-type animals. Therefore, these genetically modified mice represent a promising model for further investigations of the role of 5-HT(1A) receptors."},{"method":"With all six odorants, the animals significantly discriminated concentrations below 4 ppb (parts per billion) from the odorless solvent, and with n-butanal, n-heptanal, and n-nonanal the best-scoring animals were even able to detect concentrations below 40 ppt (parts per trillion).","background":"Using a conditioning paradigm, the olfactory sensitivity of CD-1 mice for a homologous series of aliphatic aldehydes (n-butanal to n-nonanal) was investigated.","conclusion":"The results showed (a) CD-1 mice to have a well-developed olfactory sensitivity for aliphatic aldehydes which for the majority of substances is higher than that of other mammalian species, (b) a limited concentration range of about 1 log unit from threshold to near saturation which is similar to that shown at the single receptor cell level, (c) no significant correlation between perceptibility in terms of olfactory detection thresholds and carbon chain length of the aldehydes tested, and (d) no systematic effect of preexposure to an aldehyde on sensitivity. These findings suggest that CD-1 mice are highly sensitive to non-pheromonal odorants that are abundant in plant odors. Further, the results demonstrate that sensitivity for members of a homologous series of substances is not a simple function of vapor pressure as threshold values did not correlate with molecular weight. These threshold data may provide useful information for the choice of adequate stimulus concentrations in electrophysiological or imaging studies of the olfactory system or investigations of the discriminative abilities of the mouse."},{"method":"This study shows that, in laboratory mice, the effects of stress on behavioural inhibition, investigatory behaviour and blood concentration of corticosterone are seasonally dependent. No consistency was observed between the reactivity of biological structures controlling the hormonal response to stress and the behavioural activities investigated at every period of the year. During the spring time, stress, which elicited a decrease of investigatory behaviour (estimated by the walking time in an open field), increased behavioural inhibition (estimated by the percentage of walking in the central area of the open field) as well as the blood corticosterone concentration in laboratory mice. In autumn, stress had no significant effect on behaviour despite the great hormonal concentration increase.","background":"Behavioural and hormonal seasonal changes are well documented in various vertebrate species living in their natural environment but circannual variations that may occur in laboratory animals reared in standard conditions are poorly investigated.","conclusion":"The results reveal that, at certain period of the year, a stressful procedure is unable to affect behavioural parameters in laboratory mice which were maintained in constant 12-h dark\/12-h light cycle. The report constitutes a novel piece of information suggesting a potential role of the endogenous biological clock in the modulation of stress response in mammals."},{"method":"IL-1alphabeta (-\/-) mice showed normal sensorimotor function as measured by the rotorod assay compared to control mice (BALB\/c).","background":"The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) has been implicated in both inflammatory processes and nociceptive neurotransmission. To further investigate the role of IL-1 in different pain states, gene-disrupted mice lacking both IL-1alpha and IL-1beta genes (IL-1alphabeta (-\/-)) were characterized in inflammatory, neuropathic, and post-operative pain models.","conclusion":"Acute and persistent formalin-induced nocifensive behaviors were reduced by 20% in IL-1alphabeta (-\/-) mice as compared to control mice. IL-1alphabeta (-\/-) mice also showed reduced inflammatory thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia compared to controls following the intraplantar administration of carrageenan or complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). The duration of inflammatory hyperalgesia was shortened in IL-1alphabeta (-\/-) mice versus controls in the CFA model. In contrast, deletion of IL-1alphabeta did not change the extent or the duration of post-operative pain developing after skin incision of the hind paw. Finally, time to onset, duration, and magnitude of mechanical allodynia were reduced in two models of neuropathic pain, spinal nerve L5-L6 ligation and chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve, in IL-1alphabeta (-\/-) mice versus controls. These results demonstrate that IL-1alphabeta modulates both the generation and the maintenance of inflammatory and chronic neuropathic pain and that IL-1 may modulate nociceptive sensitivity to a greater extent in conditions of chronic as compared to acute pain."},{"method":"SB-269970 was infused directly into the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) during the light phase.

In task 2, similar lesions of the ventral striatum did not change choices. In both experiments, motor functions of the chicks remained unchanged, suggesting that the lesions did not affect the foraging efficiency, i.e., objective values of food.

The acoustic parameters of the calls were not affected by different amphetamine doses or combination of agents. The increase in the number of calls occurred predominantly from the accumbens shell and to a lesser degree from the core region. This effect was dose-dependent within the range of 1-20 microg of amphetamine and was reversed by pretreatment with D1 or D2 dopamine antagonists (SKF-83566 or raclopride) administered to the same brain site. However, another D2 dopamine receptor antagonist, haloperidol, which is known to increase the accumbens dopamine level, was ineffective in reversing the increase in call number at the dose studied. On the contrary, intraacumbens haloperidol, when injected alone, caused an increase in 50 kHz calls.","background":"Emission of 50 kHz ultrasonic calls in rats is known to be associated with appetitive behavioural situations and positive social interactions. The purpose of the study was to pharmacologically characterize amphetamine-induced 50 kHz calls and to perform quantitative mapping of this response in the nucleus accumbens.","conclusion":"It is concluded that the release of dopamine, predominantly in the accumbens shell region, is responsible for production of 50 kHz calls and the calls may indicate an appetitive state compatible with anticipation of reward and positive affect. Both D1 and D2 subtypes of dopamine receptors may be necessary to induce 50 kHz calls and signal the appetitive state."}]
