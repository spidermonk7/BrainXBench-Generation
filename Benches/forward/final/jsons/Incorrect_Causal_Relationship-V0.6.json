While prior research focused on static, time-averaged task activations, we examine whether dynamic, time-varying motor states seen during active hand movements are also present at rest. Three distinct motor activation states, engaging the motor cortex alongside sensory and association areas, were identified. These states appeared both at rest and during task execution but underwent temporal reorganization from rest to task. Thus, resting-state dynamics serve as strong spatiotemporal priors for task-based activation. Critically, resting-state patterns more closely resembled those associated with frequent ecological hand movements than with an unfamiliar movement, indicating a structured repertoire of movement patterns that is replayed at rest and reorganized during action.

In tissue or 3D confinement, however, actomyosin concentrates at the posterior cell membrane, generating contractile forces that assist passage through narrow spaces, working alongside the traction force in the leading process.

Understanding neuronal mechanisms supporting exploratory and consummatory states and their switching requires experimental control of behavioral shifts and collecting sufficient amounts of brain data. To achieve this goal, we developed the ThermoMaze, which exploits the animal's natural warmth-seeking homeostatic behavior. By decreasing the floor temperature and selectively heating unmarked areas, we observed that mice avoided the aversive state by exploring the maze and finding the warm spot. In its design, the ThermoMaze is analogous to the widely used water maze but without the inconvenience of a wet environment and, therefore, allows the collection of physiological data in many trials. We combined the ThermoMaze with electrophysiology recording, and report that spiking activity of hippocampal CA1 neurons during sharp-wave ripple events encode the position of mice. Thus, place-specific firing is not confined to locomotion and associated theta oscillations but persist during waking immobility and sleep at the same location. The ThermoMaze will allow for detailed studies of brain correlates of immobility, preparatory-consummatory transitions, and open new options for studying behavior-mediated temperature homeostasis.","fake_abstract":"Brain states fluctuate between exploratory and consummatory phases of behavior.

We compared the value- and decision-coding properties of high-gamma LFPs (HG, 50-150 Hz) to the coding properties of spiking multi-unit activity (MUA) recorded concurrently on the same electrodes. HG and MUA both represented the values of decision targets, but HG signals had value-coding features that were distinct from concurrently-measured MUA. On average HG amplitude increased monotonically with value, whereas in MUA the value encoding was net neutral on average. HG encoded a signal consistent with a comparison between target values, a signal which was negligible in MUA. In individual channels, HG could predict choice outcomes more accurately than MUA; however, when channels were combined in a population-based decoder, MUA was more accurate than HG. In summary, HG signals reveal value-coding features in OFC that could not be observed from spiking activity, including representation of value comparisons and more accurate behavioral predictions. These results have implications for the role of OFC in value-based decisions, and suggest that high-frequency LFPs may be a viable - or even preferable - target for BMIs to assist cognitive function.","fake_abstract":"The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a crucial role in value-based decisions.

Viral-mediated overexpression of Cnr1 in astrocytes of the NAc shell results in baseline anxiolytic effects and dampens stress-induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in male mice. It promotes the expression of vascular-related genes and reduces astrocyte inflammatory response and morphological changes following an immune challenge with the cytokine interleukin-6, linked to stress susceptibility and mood disorders. Physical exercise and antidepressant treatment increase the expression of astrocytic Cnr1 in the perivascular region in male mice. In human tissue from male donors with major depressive disorder, we observe that the loss of NAc astrocytes leads to a decrease in CNR1. Our findings suggest a role for the astrocytic endocannabinoid system in stress responses via modulation of the BBB."},{"true_abstract":"Exposure to per- and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS) and hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs) is associated with adverse human health effects, including immunosuppression.

We applied a reinforcement-learning drift-diffusion model to LSS learning data and analysed the corresponding effective connectivity and activation measures in the brain. While both groups learned well, PR showed slower adaptation of responses than TR as trials progressed. This could be explained by a slower adjustment of the drift rate and decision boundary while learning and longer non-decision times.

Consistent with previous findings, recalibration effects plateaued with increasing audiovisual asynchrony (nonlinearity) and varied by which modality led during the exposure phase (asymmetry). We compared six observer models that differed in how they update the audiovisual temporal bias during the exposure phase and in whether they assume a modality-specific or modality-independent precision of arrival latency. The causal-inference observer shifts the audiovisual temporal bias to compensate for perceived asynchrony, which is inferred by considering two causal scenarios: when the audiovisual stimuli have a common cause or separate causes. The asynchrony-contingent observer updates the bias to achieve simultaneity of auditory and visual measurements, modulating the update rate by the likelihood of the audiovisual stimuli originating from a simultaneous event. In the asynchrony-correction model, the observer first assesses whether the sensory measurement is asynchronous; if so, she adjusts the bias proportionally to the magnitude of the measured asynchrony. Each model was paired with either modality-specific or modality-independent precision of arrival latency.

We report molecular structures of aquaporin-4 alone and bound to Fab fragments from patient-derived NMO autoantibodies using cryogenic electron microscopy. Each antibody binds to epitopes comprised of three extracellular loops of aquaporin-4 with contributions from multiple molecules in the assembly. The structures suggest that the binding of antibodies to aquaporin-4 induces the formation of higher-order orthogonal arrays of tetramers rather than stabilizing pre-existing assemblies, which increases bridging epitope diversity."},{"true_abstract":"Cytosolic aggregation of the RNA binding protein TDP-43 (transactive response DNA-binding protein 43) is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Here, we report that during oxidative stress, TDP-43 becomes SUMO2\/3-ylated by the SUMO E3 ligase protein PIAS4 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT 4) and enriches in cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs). Upon pharmacological inhibition of TDP-43 SUMO2\/3-ylation or PIAS4 depletion, TDP-43 enrichment in SGs is accompanied by irreversible aggregation. In cells that are unable to assemble SGs, SUMO2\/3-ylation of TDP-43 is strongly impaired, supporting the notion that SGs are compartments that promote TDP-43 SUMO2\/3-ylation during oxidative stress. Binding of TDP-43 to UG-rich RNA antagonizes PIAS4-mediated SUMO2\/3-ylation, while RNA dissociation promotes TDP-43 SUMO2\/3-ylation. We conclude that SUMO2\/3 protein conjugation is a cellular mechanism to stabilize cytosolic RNA-free TDP-43 against aggregation.","fake_abstract":"Cytosolic aggregation of the RNA binding protein TDP-43 (transactive response DNA-binding protein 43) is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.

Like neurons, astrocytes have many discrete heterogeneous subtypes. The subtype identity and functions are, at least in part, associated with their anatomical location and can be highly restricted to strategically important anatomical domains. Here, we report that astrocytes forming the glia limitans superficialis, the outermost border of the brain and spinal cord, are a highly specialized astrocyte subtype and can be identified by a single marker: myocilin (Myoc). We show that glia limitans superficialis astrocytes cover the entire brain and spinal cord surface, exhibit an atypical morphology, and are evolutionarily conserved from zebrafish, rodents, and non-human primates to humans. Identification of this highly specialized astrocyte subtype will advance our understanding of CNS homeostasis and potentially be targeted for therapeutic intervention to combat peripheral inflammatory effects on the CNS.","fake_abstract":"Astrocytes are a highly abundant glial cell type and perform critical homeostatic functions in the central nervous system.

This study hypothesized that, compared to the expected outcome, an unexpected outcome leads to distinctly different action-selection strategies to guide rapid adaptation. We designed behavioral measures differentiating between trial-by-trial dynamics after expected and unexpected events. In various reversal learning data with different rodent species and task complexities, conventional learning models failed to replicate the choice behavior following an unexpected outcome. This discrepancy was resolved by the proposed model with two different decision variables contingent on outcome expectation: the support-stay and conflict-shift bias. Electrophysiological data analyses revealed that striatal neurons encode our model's key variables. Furthermore, the inactivation of striatal direct and indirect pathways neutralizes the effect of past expected and unexpected outcomes, respectively, on the action-selection strategy following an unexpected outcome. Our study suggests unique roles of the striatum in arbitrating between different action selection strategies for few-shot adaptation.","fake_abstract":"Animals often exhibit rapid action changes in context-switching environments.
