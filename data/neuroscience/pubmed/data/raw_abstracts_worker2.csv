Patients on treatment with risdiplam in Italy: challenges in the interpretation of the real-world data.,"(i) provide a snapshot from a large cohort of Italian patients with SMA on risdiplam in the real-world setting; (ii) identify any differences in the cohorts before and after commercial drug approval considering the different eligibility access criteria (iii) describe preliminary data on adherence to treatment and reasons for shifting from nusinersen to risdiplam. Charts from patients on risdiplam were retrospectively reviewed. Results wereÂ then compared between patients accessing the drug during an initial restricted compassionate use program (cohort 1) and those after commercial approval, with no restrictions (cohort 2). Side effects and adherence were recorded for both cohorts as well as data on shifters. 283 patients (median age: 22 years) were included. Only a minority were walkers. Respiratory and bulbar comorbidities were more severe in cohort 1 (58% non sitters) than in cohort 2 (52% sitters). 35% and 46% of patients from cohorts 1 and 2 shifted from nusinersen to risdiplam respectively. Adherence and safety profile were good in both cohorts. This is the largest cohort described so far providing insights on the characteristics of patients on risdiplam in the real world. The disability level and age were very different from those that had driven efficacy results in the trials. This may at least in part produce some evidence to account for the variable results reported so far in the realworld. Importantly, the safety profile was confirmed even in these more severely disabled and older patients compared to those in the trials.",10.1007/s10072-025-08125-7,"['Emilio Albamonte', 'Adrea Lizio', 'Giorgia Coratti', 'Lorenzo Maggi', 'Elena Pegoraro', 'Marika Pane', 'Sonia Messina', 'Riccardo Masson', ""Adele D'Amico"", 'Enrico Bertini', 'Antonella Pini', 'Federica Ricci', 'Tiziana Mongini', 'Claudio Bruno', 'Katia Patanella', 'Maria Sframeli', 'Claudia Dosi', 'Silvia Bonanno', 'Gaia Scarpini', 'Noemi Brolatti', 'Alice Zanolini', 'Chiara Bravetti', 'Maria Carmela Pera', 'Eugenio Maria Mercuri', 'Valeria Ada Sansone']",2025-Mar,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,"['Humans', 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation', 'Male', 'Female', 'Adult', 'Electroencephalography', 'Motor Cortex', 'Young Adult', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Neural Pathways', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Humans', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Folate Receptor 1', 'Aged', 'Brain', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Middle Aged', 'Humans', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Aged', 'Gait Disorders, Neurologic', 'Middle Aged', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Antiparkinson Agents', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Humans', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Adult', 'Young Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Aging', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Electrophysiological Phenomena', 'Female', 'Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Mice', 'Neurotensin', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Hypothermia, Induced', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Male', 'Peptides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
Stimulation Parameters Recruit Distinct Cortico-Cortical Pathways: Insights from Microstate Analysis on TMS-Evoked Potentials.,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked potentials (TEPs) represent an innovative measure for examining brain connectivity and developing biomarkers of psychiatric conditions. Minimizing TEP variability across studies and participants, which may stem from methodological choices, is therefore vital. By combining classic peak analysis and microstate investigation, we tested how TMS pulse waveform and current direction may affect cortico-cortical circuit engagement when targeting the primary motor cortex (M1). We aim to disentangle whether changing these parameters affects the degree of activation of the same neural circuitry or may lead to changes in the pathways through which the induced activation spreads. Thirty-two healthy participants underwent a TMS-EEG experiment in which the pulse waveform (monophasic, biphasic) and current direction (posterior-anterior, anterior-posterior, latero-medial) were manipulated. We assessed the latency and amplitude of M1-TEP components and employed microstate analyses to test differences in topographies. Results revealed that TMS parameters strongly influenced M1-TEP components' amplitude but had a weaker role over their latencies. Microstate analysis showed that the current direction in monophasic stimulations changed the pattern of evoked microstates at the early TEP latencies, as well as their duration and global field power. This study shows that the current direction of monophasic pulses may modulate cortical sources contributing to TEP signals, activating neural populations and cortico-cortical paths more selectively. Biphasic stimulation reduces the variability associated with current direction and may be better suited when TMS targeting is blind to anatomical information.",10.1007/s10548-025-01113-2,"['Delia Lucarelli', 'Giacomo Guidali', 'Dominika Sulcova', 'Agnese Zazio', 'Natale Salvatore Bonfiglio', 'Antonietta Stango', 'Guido Barchiesi', 'Marta Bortoletto']",2025-Mar,Brain topography,"['Humans', 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation', 'Male', 'Female', 'Adult', 'Electroencephalography', 'Motor Cortex', 'Young Adult', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Neural Pathways', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Humans', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Folate Receptor 1', 'Aged', 'Brain', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Middle Aged', 'Humans', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Aged', 'Gait Disorders, Neurologic', 'Middle Aged', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Antiparkinson Agents', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Humans', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Adult', 'Young Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Aging', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Electrophysiological Phenomena', 'Female', 'Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Mice', 'Neurotensin', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Hypothermia, Induced', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Male', 'Peptides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"

Prefrontal-hippocampal pathways underlying adolescent resilience.,"The prefrontal-hippocampal pathways are integral to memory suppression, facilitating positive and adaptative responses following traumatic events. However, the role of these circuits in promoting resilience among adolescents remains largely unknown. This study used structural similarity analysis of MRI-based gray matter volume (GMV) to map connectivity networks centered on the hippocampus, investigating whether structural similarity between prefrontal regions and hippocampus were related to resilience in a cohort of 145 adolescents. Additionally, spatial correlation analyses of resilience-related structural similarity network and neurotransmitter distribution maps were conducted to identify molecular adaptations within prefrontal-hippocampal circuits associated with resilience. The results showed that higher resilience levels were correlated with stronger structural similarity between the prefrontal areas (i.e., middle frontal gyrus and orbitofrontal cortex) and hippocampus. Furthermore, the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, which modulates neural oscillations in prefrontal-hippocampal pathways, appears to be associated with resilience. The current findings suggest that structural and molecular adaptations within prefrontal-hippocampal circuits, which are implicated in the suppression of intrusive, unwanted memories, may foster resilience in young people. These insights advance our knowledge of the neurobiological markers of resilience, paving the way for more targeted and effective therapeutic interventions to bolster resilience and mitigate adverse outcomes in developmental populations.",10.1007/s00787-025-02704-x,"['Luqing Wei', 'Zhengdong Wu', 'Qi Xia', 'Chris Baeken', 'Guo-Rong Wu']",2025-Mar,European child & adolescent psychiatry,"['Humans', 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation', 'Male', 'Female', 'Adult', 'Electroencephalography', 'Motor Cortex', 'Young Adult', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Neural Pathways', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Humans', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Folate Receptor 1', 'Aged', 'Brain', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Middle Aged', 'Humans', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Aged', 'Gait Disorders, Neurologic', 'Middle Aged', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Antiparkinson Agents', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Humans', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Adult', 'Young Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Aging', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Electrophysiological Phenomena', 'Female', 'Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Mice', 'Neurotensin', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Hypothermia, Induced', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Male', 'Peptides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
Sex-specific modulation of FOLR1 and its cycle enzyme genes in Alzheimer's disease brain regions.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by progressive cognitive and functional decline. Its incidence increases significantly with age and is more prevalent in women than men. We investigated the folate receptor alpha (FOLR1) gene expression levels in the central nervous system (CNS) of AD and non-demented healthy control (NDHC) subjects. Our cohort included 3,946 samples: 2,391 NDHC and 1,555 AD patients, stratified by brain region, age, and sex. Interestingly, a significant increase in FOLR1 expression was observed only in females with AD compared to NDHC females. Furthermore, we found that FOLR1 expression was differentially increased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and diencephalon (DIE) only in AD females. Moreover, in females, genes involved in the folic acid (FA) cycle that drives DNA synthesis were significantly modulated. In contrast, in males, downregulation of TYMS effectively blocks the completion of the cycle, thereby preventing downstream DNA synthesis. Tissue Transcriptome Deconvolution (TTD) analysis revealed astrocytes and endothelial cells associated with FOLR1 expression in both AD males and females. Gene Ontology analysis supported these findings, showing enrichment in processes aligned with these cell types. Positive correlations between brain FOLR1 expression and markers for astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and endothelial cells (CD31) provided further validation. Our findings suggest a potential role for sex-dependent FOLR1 expression and its association with specific brain regions and cellular processes in AD.",10.1007/s11011-025-01578-x,"['Cristina Sanfilippo', 'Paola Castrogiovanni', 'Rosa Imbesi', 'Michele Vecchio', 'Manlio Vinciguerra', 'Kaj Blennow', 'Henrik Zetterberg', 'Michelino Di Rosa']",2025-Mar,Metabolic brain disease,"['Humans', 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation', 'Male', 'Female', 'Adult', 'Electroencephalography', 'Motor Cortex', 'Young Adult', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Neural Pathways', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Humans', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Folate Receptor 1', 'Aged', 'Brain', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Middle Aged', 'Humans', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Aged', 'Gait Disorders, Neurologic', 'Middle Aged', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Antiparkinson Agents', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Humans', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Adult', 'Young Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Aging', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Electrophysiological Phenomena', 'Female', 'Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Mice', 'Neurotensin', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Hypothermia, Induced', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Male', 'Peptides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
The effects of dopaminergic medication and task load on trembling and akinetic freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease.,"In people with Parkinson's disease (PD), freezing of gait (FOG) can manifest as an absence of leg movement (akinetic) or a presence of high-frequency leg trembling. FOG is triggered most often during turning or dual-tasking when OFF-medication, but it is unclear whether the same holds true for akinetic and trembling FOG. To investigate the effects of dopaminergic medication and cognitive and motor tasks on trembling and akinetic FOG. Sixty-three PD patients with daily FOG performed a home-based FOG-provoking protocol OFF and ON-dopaminergic medication. FOG was video-annotated based on pre-specified definitions. We compared the % time in trembling and in akinetic FOG between OFF and ON. We also analyzed these outcomes during various motor tasks and with- and without a cognitive dual task. To identify subgroups, an exploratory k-means cluster analysis was performed. Trembling and akinetic FOG co-occurred in most patients (82.5%), although trembling was observed most frequently. Both manifestations were ameliorated by medication, but we identified four different patterns: a responsive mild group (nâ=â32), an unresponsive akinetic-dominant group (nâ=â8), and two trembling-dominant groups with (nâ=â12) and without (nâ=â11) a response to medication. Task load also affected the manifestations differentially, as dual-tasking and gait initiation induced more akinetic FOG compared to other conditions. Trembling and akinetic FOG respond similarly to dopaminergic medication (except for a specific trembling subgroup), yet they are differentially influenced by FOG triggers. Altogether, we suggest that ""trembling"" may represent a milder form of FOG, although ""trembling"" as a distinct FOG-variant cannot be rule out.",10.1007/s00415-025-13023-1,"['Demi Zoetewei', 'Pieter Ginis', 'Talia Herman', 'Moran Gilat', ""Nicholas D'Cruz"", 'Luca Palmerini', 'Eran Gazit', 'Jeffrey M Hausdorff', 'Alice Nieuwboer']",2025-Mar,Journal of neurology,"['Humans', 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation', 'Male', 'Female', 'Adult', 'Electroencephalography', 'Motor Cortex', 'Young Adult', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Neural Pathways', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Humans', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Folate Receptor 1', 'Aged', 'Brain', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Middle Aged', 'Humans', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Aged', 'Gait Disorders, Neurologic', 'Middle Aged', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Antiparkinson Agents', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Humans', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Adult', 'Young Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Aging', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Electrophysiological Phenomena', 'Female', 'Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Mice', 'Neurotensin', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Hypothermia, Induced', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Male', 'Peptides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
Managing impulse control and related behavioral disorders in Parkinson's disease: where we are in 2025?,"Impulse control and related behavioral disorders (ICBDs) commonly complicate Parkinson's disease (PD) course. The ICBDs spectrum encompasses two groups of conditions, with distinct pathophysiology: proper 'impulse control disorders (ICDs)' (e.g. gambling) and the 'ICDs related disorders (ICDs-RD)' (e.g. punding). Behavioral disturbances are associated with dopamine replacement therapies. ICBDs significantly affect the quality of life of patients and caregivers, making their management essential for reducing the overall burden of PD. This article reviews the current management strategies for ICBDs in PD. The authors highlight their strengths and limitations of these strategies, and explore the potential role of emerging treatment options, giving particular focus to new compounds and invasive therapies. Prevention, close monitoring and caregiver involvement are essential in managing ICBDs in PD. Treatment approaches should be tailored to ICBDs' functional impact and aimed to reduce the pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors, especially D2. Dopamine agonist (DA) tapering remains the primary therapeutic approach for ICDs, alongside psychotherapy and second-line agents, like atypical antipsychotics and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. Insights into ICDs pathophysiology and DA-specific pharmacodynamics indicate safer profiles for certain preparations (e.g. rotigotine patches) and possibly for D1/D5 agonists like tavapadon. Invasive treatments, including deep brain stimulation and infusion therapies, should be prioritized in advanced-stage PD complicated by ICBDs.",10.1080/14737175.2025.2485337,"['Leonardo Rigon', 'Carmelo Fogliano', 'K Ray Chaudhuri', 'Karolina Poplawska-Domaszewicz', 'Cristian Falup-Pecurariu', 'Iulia Murasan', 'Mirjam Wolfschlag', 'Per Odin', 'Angelo Antonini']",2025-Mar,Expert review of neurotherapeutics,"['Humans', 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation', 'Male', 'Female', 'Adult', 'Electroencephalography', 'Motor Cortex', 'Young Adult', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Neural Pathways', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Humans', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Folate Receptor 1', 'Aged', 'Brain', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Middle Aged', 'Humans', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Aged', 'Gait Disorders, Neurologic', 'Middle Aged', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Antiparkinson Agents', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Humans', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Adult', 'Young Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Aging', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Electrophysiological Phenomena', 'Female', 'Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Mice', 'Neurotensin', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Hypothermia, Induced', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Male', 'Peptides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
Electrophysiology and morphology of human cortical supragranular pyramidal cells in a wide age range.,"The basic excitatory neurons of the cerebral cortex, the pyramidal cells, are the most important signal integrators for the local circuit. They have quite characteristic morphological and electrophysiological properties that are known to be largely constant with age in the young and adult cortex. However, the brain undergoes several dynamic changes throughout life, such as in the phases of early development and cognitive decline in the aging brain. We set out to search for intrinsic cellular changes in supragranular pyramidal cells across a broad age range: from birth to 85 y of age and we found differences in several biophysical properties between defined age groups. During the first year of life, subthreshold and suprathreshold electrophysiological properties changed in a way that shows that pyramidal cells become less excitable with maturation, but also become temporarily more precise. According to our findings, the morphological features of the three-dimensional reconstructions from different life stages showed consistent morphological properties and systematic dendritic spine analysis of an infantile and an old pyramidal cell showed clear significant differences in the distribution of spine shapes. Overall, the changes that occur during development and aging may have lasting effects on the properties of pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex. Understanding these changes is important to unravel the complex mechanisms underlying brain development, cognition, and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.",10.7554/eLife.100390,"['PÃ¡l BarzÃ³', 'IldikÃ³ SzÃ¶ts', 'Martin TÃ³th', 'Ãva Adrienn CsajbÃ³k', 'GÃ¡bor MolnÃ¡r', 'GÃ¡bor TamÃ¡s']",2025-Mar,eLife,"['Humans', 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation', 'Male', 'Female', 'Adult', 'Electroencephalography', 'Motor Cortex', 'Young Adult', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Neural Pathways', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Humans', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Folate Receptor 1', 'Aged', 'Brain', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Middle Aged', 'Humans', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Aged', 'Gait Disorders, Neurologic', 'Middle Aged', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Antiparkinson Agents', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Humans', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Adult', 'Young Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Aging', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Electrophysiological Phenomena', 'Female', 'Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Mice', 'Neurotensin', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Hypothermia, Induced', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Male', 'Peptides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
"A peptide-neurotensin conjugate that crosses the blood-brain barrier induces pharmacological hypothermia associated with anticonvulsant, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory properties following status epilepticus in mice.","Preclinical and clinical studies show that mild to moderate hypothermia is neuroprotective in sudden cardiac arrest, ischemic stroke, perinatal hypoxia/ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and seizures. Induction of hypothermia largely involves physical cooling therapies, which induce several clinical complications, while some molecules have shown to be efficient in pharmacologically induced hypothermia (PIH). Neurotensin (NT), a 13 amino acid neuropeptide that regulates body temperature, interacts with various receptors to mediate its peripheral and central effects. NT induces PIH when administered intracerebrally. However, these effects are not observed if NT is administered peripherally, due to its rapid degradation and poor passage of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We conjugated NT to peptides that bind the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) to generate 'vectorized' forms of NT with enhanced BBB permeability. We evaluated their effects in epileptic conditions following peripheral administration. One of these conjugates, VH-N412, displayed improved stability, binding potential to both the LDLR and NTSR-1, rodent/human cross-reactivity and improved brain distribution. In a mouse model of kainate (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE), VH-N412 elicited rapid hypothermia associated with anticonvulsant effects, potent neuroprotection, and reduced hippocampal inflammation. VH-N412 also reduced sprouting of the dentate gyrus mossy fibers and preserved learning and memory skills in the treated mice. In cultured hippocampal neurons, VH-N412 displayed temperature-independent neuroprotective properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the successful treatment of SE with PIH. In all, our results show that vectorized NT may elicit different neuroprotection mechanisms mediated by hypothermia and/or by intrinsic neuroprotective properties.",10.7554/eLife.100527,"['Lotfi Ferhat', 'Rabia Soussi', 'Maxime Masse', 'Grigorios Kyriatzis', 'StÃ©phane Girard', 'Fanny Gassiot', 'Nicolas Gaudin', 'Mathieu Laurencin', 'Anne Bernard', 'AngÃ©lique BÃ´le', 'GÃ©raldine Ferracci', 'Maria Smirnova', 'FranÃ§ois Roman', 'Vincent Dive', 'Salvatore Cisternino', 'Jamal Temsamani', 'Marion David', 'Pascaline LÃ©corchÃ©', 'Guillaume Jacquot', 'Michel Khrestchatisky']",2025-Mar,eLife,"['Humans', 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation', 'Male', 'Female', 'Adult', 'Electroencephalography', 'Motor Cortex', 'Young Adult', 'Evoked Potentials, Motor', 'Neural Pathways', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Humans', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Folate Receptor 1', 'Aged', 'Brain', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Middle Aged', 'Humans', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Male', 'Female', 'Aged', 'Gait Disorders, Neurologic', 'Middle Aged', 'Dopamine Agents', 'Antiparkinson Agents', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Humans', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Adult', 'Young Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Aging', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Electrophysiological Phenomena', 'Female', 'Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Mice', 'Neurotensin', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Hypothermia, Induced', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Male', 'Peptides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
