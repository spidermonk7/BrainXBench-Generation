Improvement in multiple cognitive domains via combined revascularization by 6 months' follow-up: a new potential surgical indication in moyamoya disease.,"Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a cerebrovascular condition characterized by progressive stenosis of the main branches of the cerebral artery. Patients with MMD are prone to cognitive decline due to chronic hypoperfusion. Whether revascularization surgery can reverse cognitive dysfunction by improving cerebral blood flow perfusion and what types and levels of cognitive dysfunction can benefit most from the surgery remain unclear. Between July 31, 2022, and May 15, 2024, a total of 155 patients were prospectively enrolled in this trial and underwent combined or indirect revascularization with an average 6-month follow-up. Eleven types of cognitive domains were tested. Subgroup analysis was used to compare the postoperative benefits of different surgical procedures and preoperative cognitive levels. Choice reaction time (adjusted p = 0.032), verbal working memory (adjusted p = 0.006), mental rotation (adjusted p = 0.002), complex subtraction (adjusted p < 0.001), and word memory (adjusted p < 0.001) improved significantly after surgery. Combined revascularization led to improvement in more cognitive domains (choice reaction time, p < 0.001; mental rotation, p < 0.001; word memory, p < 0.001; executive inhibition in the same direction, p = 0.016; complex subtraction, p = 0.001; and verbal working memory in reverse order, p = 0.001) than indirect revascularization (word memory, p = 0.023; and complex subtraction, p = 0.007). Revascularization can selectively reverse cognitive dysfunction by improving cerebral blood flow perfusion in adults with MMD. Combined revascularization may allow more definite hemodynamic improvement than indirect revascularization, leading to more frequent and greater potential improvement in more cognitive domains; however, more studies are needed to confirm this. A population with lower preoperative cognition and good postoperative collateral formation may benefit more from the surgery.",10.3171/2024.11.JNS241932,"['Ziqi Liu', 'Xiaokuan Hao', 'Chaoran Shen', 'Shihao He', 'Jing Gu', 'Junze Zhang', 'Yanru Wang', 'Xilong Wang', 'Zhenyu Zhou', 'Ning Ma', 'Ran Duan', 'Weitao Jin', 'Xin Lou', 'Xinlin Zhou', 'Tao Yu', 'Yongbo Yang', 'Rong Wang']",2025-Mar,Journal of neurosurgery,"['Humans', 'HeLa Cells', 'Gases', 'Acoustics', 'Micromanipulation', 'Animals', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices']"
"Mapping, classification, and surgical strategy for vertebral artery variation in posterior atlantoaxial joint release, distraction, and fusion surgery for basilar invagination and atlantoaxial instability.","The objective of this study was to develop a vertebral artery (VA) classification system that improves risk assessment using a 2D map of the VA position at the craniovertebral junction (CVJ), and to outline surgical strategies for managing anomalous VAs during the posterior atlantoaxial joint release, distraction, and fusion technique in the treatment of basilar invagination (BI) and atlantoaxial instability (AAI). In this retrospective study, 125 patients (mean age 44.1 years) with BI and AAI who underwent surgery between January 2019 and April 2021 using the atlantoaxial joint release, distraction, and fusion technique were included. A distribution map was used to better delineate the course of VA and its relationship with the atlantoaxial facet. Under the concept of the current technique, the morphology of VA was reclassified according to the severity of anomaly and surgical risk. Intraoperative risks were graded, and different strategies for handling anomalous vessels were discussed based on the classification. A system of mapping VA distribution was proposed and showed that up to 27% of VAs coursed posterior to the atlantoaxial facet joint, which evidently hampered the facet joint release and manipulation. The VAs coursed in the inferomedial field less frequently. Based on the surgical risk of the posterior atlantoaxial joint release, distraction, and fusion technique, the morphology of VA was classified into 5 types. Additionally, patients were categorized into low-risk, medium-risk, high-risk, and contraindicated groups, according to bilateral VA patterns and institutional surgical experience. Different intraoperative strategies for handling anomalous vessels were introduced and discussed. Intragenic VA injury occurred in 2 of 125 patients (1.6%). The authors introduced a novel method of describing the VA course at the CVJ, called VA mapping, and a VA classification system was proposed to enhance the understanding of risk evaluation in the context of atlantoaxial joint release, distraction, and fusion. A risk stratification system was determined based on bilateral VA patterns, and specific surgical strategies were formulated. The overall iatrogenic VA injury rate was 1.6%, indicating the proposed classification and surgical protocol are reliable and reproducible for minimizing the risk of intraoperative VA injury.",10.3171/2024.12.SPINE24185,"['Yue-Qi Du', 'Wanru Duan', 'Mao-Yang Qi', 'Jia-Lu Wang', 'Bo-Yan Zhang', 'Hong-Feng Meng', 'Tian-Yu Jin', 'Can Zhang', 'Peng-Hao Liu', 'Jian Guan', 'Feng-Zeng Jian', 'Zan Chen']",2025-Mar,Journal of neurosurgery.

"Indications and outcomes of the extended endoscopic endonasal approach for the removal of ""unconventional"" suprasellar pituitary neuroendocrine tumors.","Pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) rarely harbor ""unconventional"" inner features such as wide intracranial extension, fibrous consistency, irregular shape, vessel encasement, and subarachnoid space invasion that increase surgical complexity, as they are not suitable for the standard transsphenoidal route. Among this subset of difficult adenomas, PitNETs harboring an unconventional suprasellar extension present peculiar surgical considerations and challenges. Herein, the authors present an international multicentric study, intending to analyze the indications and outcomes of the endoscopic endonasal transtuberculum-transplanum approach (ETTA) for the removal of these so-called unconventional PitNETs in a large cohort of patients. PitNETs removed via an endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) between January 2000 and December 2023 at 4 primary referral centers were retrospectively reviewed. Tumors removed via the ETTA and harboring one or more of the following unconventional suprasellar features, regardless of size and/or cavernous sinus invasion, were included in the study: irregular shape, vessel encasement, subarachnoid invasion at the supradiaphragmatic space, and firm or fibrous consistency. Clinical, radiological, surgical findings, and outcomes were reviewed. Of a total of 5138 patients with PitNETs, 257 patients underwent an ETTA (5%). Nonfunctioning PitNETs were the most common (65.4%). The most common presenting symptoms were visual field restriction (64.6%), decreased visual acuity (51%), anterior pituitary deficiency (44.8%), and endocrine hyperproduction syndromes (20.6%). All PitNETs harbored prominent suprasellar extension: 33.1% were giant and 30.7% were fibrous; the majority were multilobular (43.6%) and Knosp grade ≥ 3 (54.1%). Overall, 51.8% of patients had undergone previous treatment. The gross-total resection (GTR) rate was 49.8%. Visual field and visual acuity improved in 67.5% and 82.4% of cases, respectively. The postoperative complication rate was 19.1%. Previous treatment, vessel encasement, and Knosp grade ≥ 3 were independent risk factors affecting extent of resection. A suprasellar tumor remnant was the only significant risk factor for vascular complications, and tumor GTR the only protecting factor. This is the largest series in the literature describing indications and outcome expectations of the ETTA for the removal of unconventional suprasellar PitNETs. Tumor size, shape, and consistency did not represent a limitation to favorable surgical outcomes. The difficulty in achieving total removal of unconventional PitNETs, especially in the presence of vessel encasement and recurrent lesions, should raise the awareness of the increased risk of suprasellar tumor remnant apoplexy and arterial vasospasm, particularly in tumors with subarachnoid invasion.",10.3171/2024.11.JNS242484,"['Domenico Solari', ""Elena d'Avella"", 'Garni Barkhoudarian', 'Matteo Zoli', 'Stephanie Cheok', 'Ilaria Bove', 'Gianluca Lorenzo Fabozzi', 'Gabriel Zada', 'Diego Mazzatenta', 'Daniel F Kelly', 'Paolo Cappabianca', 'Luigi Maria Cavallo']",2025-Mar,Journal of neurosurgery,"['Humans', 'HeLa Cells', 'Gases', 'Acoustics', 'Micromanipulation', 'Animals', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices']"
The mood stabilizers lithium and valproate disrupt hepatic and intestinal farnesoid X receptor signalling and increase bile synthesis in the rat.,"The mood stabilizers lithium and valproate are psychotropic medications widely used in clinical practice. Despite their proven benefits, many individuals stop their treatment due to the adverse effects. Chronic diarrhoea is a common reason for discontinuation of these drugs; however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Excessive loss of bile acids (BA) into the colon is a major cause of diarrhoea. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of these drugs on BA metabolism. We measured BA levels in the liver, plasma and faeces of Sprague-Dawley rats treated with lithium or valproate for 4 weeks. Next, we analysed changes in the expression of genes and proteins involved in BA production and enterohepatic circulation. Lithium and valproate markedly increased BA levels across all body sites. This was accompanied by the up-regulation of hepatic cytochrome P450 7A1 (Cyp7a1), the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo BA synthesis. Under normal conditions, elevated levels of BAs suppress Cyp7a1 via activation of the hepatic farnesoid X receptor (Fxr)/small heterodimer partner (Shp) and intestinal Fxr/fibroblast growth factor 19 (Fgf19) pathways. This signalling was disrupted in both treatment groups. The Fxr-mediated responses in the expression of Ntcp, Asbt, Ilbp and Ostα/β bile transporters were also affected by treatment. In conclusion, lithium and valproate disrupted farnesoid X receptor signalling at the hepatic and intestinal levels, inducing sustained overproduction of bile in rats. These findings provide novel insights into the peripheral effects of these drugs. Given that similar changes in bile circuits underlie the pathophysiology of primary BA diarrhoea in humans, this study suggests a potential mechanism behind chronic diarrhoea in patients undergoing lithium or valproate therapy.",10.1113/EP092451,"['Sofia Cussotto', 'Anna V Golubeva', 'Alvaro Lopez Gallardo', 'Thomaz F S Bastiaanssen', 'Alexander V Zhdanov', 'Gerard M Moloney', 'Caitriona Scaife', 'Jane A English', 'Susan A Joyce', 'Timothy G Dinan', 'John F Cryan']",2025-Mar,Experimental physiology,"['Humans', 'HeLa Cells', 'Gases', 'Acoustics', 'Micromanipulation', 'Animals', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices']"
Chemical genomics informs antibiotic and essential gene function in Acinetobacter baumannii.,"The Gram-negative pathogen, Acinetobacter baumannii, poses a serious threat to human health due to its role in nosocomial infections that are resistant to treatment with current antibiotics. Despite this, our understanding of fundamental A. baumannii biology remains limited, as many essential genes have not been experimentally characterized. These essential genes are critical for bacterial survival and, thus, represent promising targets for drug discovery. Here, we systematically probe the function of essential genes by screening a CRISPR interference knockdown library against a diverse panel of chemical inhibitors, including antibiotics. We find that most essential genes show chemical-gene interactions, allowing insights into both inhibitor and gene function. For instance, knockdown of lipooligosaccharide (LOS) transport genes increased sensitivity to a broad range of chemicals. Cells with defective LOS transport showed cell envelope hyper-permeability that was dependent on continued LOS synthesis. Using phenotypes across our chemical-gene interaction dataset, we constructed an essential gene network linking poorly understood genes to well-characterized genes in cell division and other processes. Finally, our phenotype-structure analysis identified structurally related antibiotics with distinct cellular impacts and suggested potential targets for underexplored inhibitors. This study advances our understanding of essential gene and inhibitor function, providing a valuable resource for mechanistic studies, therapeutic strategies, and future key targets for antibiotic development.",10.1371/journal.pgen.1011642,"['Jennifer Suzanne Tran', 'Ryan David Ward', 'Rubén Iruegas-López', 'Ingo Ebersberger', 'Jason Matthew Peters']",2025-Mar,PLoS genetics,"['Humans', 'HeLa Cells', 'Gases', 'Acoustics', 'Micromanipulation', 'Animals', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices']"
1953-2023. Seventy Years of the Nerve Growth Factor: A Potential Novel Treatment in Neurological Diseases?,"Rita Levi-Montalcini's 1953 discovery of nerve growth factor (NGF) in mouse sarcoma tumors marked a groundbreaking moment in neuroscience. NGF, a key signaling molecule, became the first identified neurotrophic factor, influencing the growth, differentiation, and survival of neurons in both peripheral and central nervous systems. NGF and related neurotrophic factors hold therapeutic potential for various neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, neuropathies, traumatic brain injuries, and stroke. However, despite promising in vitro studies and animal models findings, NGF efficacy in patients remains unproven. Indeed, its use as a therapeutic agent faces challenges in delivery and clinical translation. This review delves into these challenges, exploring ongoing research on refined delivery methods, dosages, and safety profiles. Innovative strategies, including molecular mimicking, combination therapies, gene therapy, and coupling with neuromodulation techniques like transcranial magnetic stimulation and vagal nerve stimulation, are discussed. Incorporating nerve growth factor (NGF) into a comprehensive strategy may prove beneficial, particularly in non-neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke, trauma, and neuropathies. In these instances, NGF holds promise for promoting tissue regeneration and repair. Challenges persist in addressing the complexity of neurodegenerative pathologies for a combined therapeutic approach.",10.14336/AD.2024.0573,"['Davide Norata', 'Fioravante Capone', 'Francesco Motolese', 'Massimo Marano', 'Mariagrazia Rossi', 'Rosalinda Calandrelli', 'Marta Sacchetti', 'Flavio Mantelli', 'Vincenzo Di Lazzaro', 'Fabio Pilato']",2025-Mar,Aging and disease,"['Humans', 'HeLa Cells', 'Gases', 'Acoustics', 'Micromanipulation', 'Animals', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices']"
Association Between Dementia and Optical Coherence Tomography Scan Quality.,"It is generally assumed that dementia affects the quality of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans. However, the magnitude of this effect and its independence from other factors require further clarification. In this cross-sectional study, our aim was to evaluate the association between cognitive impairment and OCT scan quality, adjusting for key confounders, in a multiethnic cohort. 541 participants aged 50 years or older were recruited from memory clinics and the community at the National University Hospital and St. Luke's Hospital, Singapore. They were then stratified into three groups: no cognitive impairment (NCI, n=112), cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND, n=235), and dementia (n=194); OCT scan quality was subsequently assessed based on the presence and severity of artifacts. We found that dementia patients were nearly three times more likely to produce poor-quality OCT scans compared to NCI participants (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=2.90; 95% CI, 1.24-6.80). Lower cognitive scores, including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (OR=0.92; 95% CI, 0.88-0.96), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (OR=0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.94), and higher Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores (OR=2.11; 95% CI, 1.43-3.10), were also independently associated with poor scan quality. In conclusion, cognitive impairment, particularly dementia, substantially increases the likelihood of poor-quality OCT scans, even after accounting for key demographic and clinical factors. Hence, strategies tailored to improve imaging in this population are essential for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and patient care.",10.14336/AD.2024.1744,"['Reuben Jyong Kiat Foo', 'Damon Wong', 'Nur Fidyana Binte Abdul Gani', 'Bingyao Tan', 'Munirah Binte Ismail', 'Gerhard Garhöfer', 'Laetitia Hinterhuber', 'Narayanaswamy Venketasubramanian', 'Christopher Li-Hsian Chen', 'Leopold Schmetterer', 'Jacqueline Chua']",2025-Mar,Aging and disease,"['Humans', 'HeLa Cells', 'Gases', 'Acoustics', 'Micromanipulation', 'Animals', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices']"
μSonic-hand: Biomedical micromanipulation driven by acoustic gas-liquid-solid interactions.,"Micromanipulation is crucial for operating and analyzing microobjects in advanced biomedical applications. However, safe, low-cost, multifunctional micromanipulation for operating bio-objects across scales and modalities remains inaccessible. Here, we propose a versatile micromanipulation method driven by acoustic gas-liquid-solid interactions, named μSonic-hand. The bubble contained at the end of a micropipette and the surrounding liquid form a gas-liquid multiphase system susceptible to acoustic waves. Driven by a piezoelectric transducer, the oscillating gas-liquid interface induces acoustic microstreaming, markedly increasing the mass transfer efficiency. It enables multiple liquid micromanipulations, including mixing, dispersion, enhancing cell membrane permeability, and harvesting selected cells. Furthermore, a controllable three-dimensional axisymmetric vortex in an open environment overcomes the constraints of microfluidic chip, enabling stable trapping, rapid transportation, and multidirectional rotation of HeLa cells, embryos, and other bio-objects ranging from micrometers to millimeters. A variety of applications demonstrate that the μSonic-hand, with its wide-range capabilities, inherent biocompatibility, and extremely low cost could remarkably advance biomedical science.",10.1126/sciadv.ads8167,"['Xiaoming Liu', 'Yuyang Li', 'Fengyu Liu', 'Qing Shi', 'Lixin Dong', 'Qiang Huang', 'Tatsuo Arai', 'Toshio Fukuda']",2025-Mar,Science advances,"['Humans', 'HeLa Cells', 'Gases', 'Acoustics', 'Micromanipulation', 'Animals', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices']"
