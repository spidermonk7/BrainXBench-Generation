Septo-hypothalamic regulation of binge-like alcohol consumption by the nociceptin system.,"High-intensity alcohol drinking during binge episodes contributes to the socioeconomic burden created by alcohol use disorders (AUDs), and nociceptin receptor (NOP) antagonists have emerged as a promising intervention. To better understand the contribution of the NOP system to binge drinking, we found that nociceptin-containing neurons of the lateral septum (LS",10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115482,"['Harold Haun', 'Raul Hernandez', 'Luzi Yan', 'Meghan Flanigan', 'Olivia Hon', 'Sophia Lee', 'Hernán Méndez', 'Alison Roland', 'Lisa Taxier', 'Thomas Kash']",2025-Mar,Cell reports,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
Neural correlates of visual object recognition in rats.,"Invariant object recognition-the ability to recognize objects across size, rotation, or context-is fundamental for making sense of a dynamic visual world. Though traditionally studied in primates, emerging evidence suggests rodents recognize objects across a range of identity-preserving transformations. We demonstrate that rats robustly perform visual object recognition and explore a neural pathway that may underlie this capacity by developing a pipeline from high-throughput behavior training to cellular resolution imaging in awake, head-fixed animals. Leveraging our optical approach, we systematically profile neurons in primary and higher-order visual areas and their spatial organization. We find that rat visual cortex exhibits several features similar to those observed in the primate ventral stream but also marked deviations, suggesting species-specific differences in how brains solve visual object recognition. This work reinforces the sophisticated visual abilities of rats and offers the technical foundation to use them as a powerful model for mechanistic perception.",10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115461,"['Juliana Y Rhee', 'César Echavarría', 'Edward Soucy', 'Joel Greenwood', 'Javier A Masís', 'David D Cox']",2025-Mar,Cell reports,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
Monocytic TLR4 expression and activation in schizophrenia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The role of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in schizophrenia remains unclear, with studies reporting conflicting results on its expression and activation in persons with schizophrenia (PwSCZ). This systematic review/meta-analysis compared basal monocytic TLR4 expression, as well as its activation pattern between PwSCZ and healthy controls (HCs). This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021273858) and adhered to the PRISMA guidelines. A systematic search was conducted through MEDLINE (via PubMed), Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to December 12, 2023. Quantitative syntheses were conducted for (a) basal monocytic TLR4 density, (b) basal percentage of TLR4+ monocytes, and (c) basal TLR4 gene expression. Effect sizes were computed using Hedges' g for mean differences. Random-effect models with restricted maximum-likelihood estimation were used, and subgrouping was conducted based on antipsychotic status. The studies' risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tool. Eleven studies (473 PwSCZ, 416 HCs) were included. Pooled analysis revealed a nonsignificant trend toward increased basal monocytic TLR4 density in PwSCZ (Hedges' g = 0.317 [95% CI: -0.060, 0.694], τ2 = 0.127, I2 = 68.91%). The difference became significant after sensitivity analysis and excluding one study (Hedges' g = 0.469 [0.195,0.742], p = 0.001). No significant difference was found between the groups in terms of TLR4+ monocytes percentage (Hedges' g = 0.235 [-0.245, 0.715], τ2 = 0.31, I2 = 87.30%) or TLR4 gene expression (Hedges' g = 0.179 [-0.502, 0.861], τ2 = 0.29, I2 = 79.04%). According to qualitative synthesis, TLR4 stimulation resulted in reduced monocytic activation in PwSCZ compared to HCs. This study suggested a trend toward an increased basal monocytic TLR4 density in PwSCZ, with no difference in the basal percentage of TLR4+ monocytes or TLR4 gene expression. However, the limited available data underscores the need for future studies.",10.1371/journal.pone.0319171,"['Melika Jameie', 'Sanaz Bordbar', 'Reza Samiee', 'Mobina Amanollahi', 'Mehdi Azizmohammad Looha', 'Mir Sajjad Aleyasin', 'Mohammad Reza Abdol Homayuni', 'Mehrdad Mozafar', 'Seyed Behnamedin Jameie', 'Shahin Akhondzadeh']",N/A,PloS one,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
Delivering systems-level change to improve post-diagnostic dementia support: Qualitative findings from the PriDem study.,"There are 900,000 people with dementia in England and Wales. Existing models of post-diagnostic support are unsustainable and unaffordable. The PriDem programme developed a new model of primary care-based dementia care, whereby a Clinical Dementia Lead (CDL) would facilitate systems-level change. To assess barriers and facilitators to implementation of the PriDem intervention. 7 general practices participated in a qualitative process evaluation, as part of the mixed-methods feasibility and implementation study. Practices were located within 4 Primary Care Networks in the North East and South East of England. 26 healthcare professionals, 14 people with dementia and 16 carers linked to participating general practices participated in semi-structured individual and small group interviews. Additional qualitative data were generated through nonparticipant observations and researcher fieldnotes from CDL intervention supervision sessions. Data were analysed using abductive codebook thematic analysis informed by Normalisation Process Theory (NPT). Six themes were generated: 1) The rocky ground of primary care; 2) The power of people; 3) Tension between adaptability and fidelity; 4) Challenging the status quo: reimagining care planning; 5) One size doesn't fit all; 6) Positive effects on people and systems: towards sustainability. Through the lens of NPT we can understand the contextual challenges facing primary care, the mechanisms (e.g., work undertaken by individuals) to overcome those challenges, as well as the potential outcomes of such an approach, in terms of longer-term sustainability of changes made. Despite the pressures facing primary care within England and Wales, meaningful change can be made to practice in the care of people with dementia. The presence of motivated and engaged staff are critical to implementation, as is ensuring understanding of complex interventions, so that fidelity can be maintained. People with dementia and carers benefitted from improved care systems. Commissioners should consider the benefits of a CDL-led approach.",10.1371/journal.pone.0317811,"['Emily Spencer', 'Katie Flanagan', 'Marie Poole', ""Federica D'Andrea"", 'Maud Hevink', 'Jane Wilcock', 'Kate Walters', 'Louise Robinson', 'Greta Rait', 'Sarah Griffiths']",N/A,PloS one,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
The impact of self-isolation on psychological wellbeing in adults and how to reduce it: A systematic review.,"To synthesise evidence on the impact of self-isolation at home on the psychological and emotional wellbeing of adults in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022378140). We searched Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Embase, and grey literature. Wellbeing included adverse mental health outcomes and adaptive wellbeing. We followed PRISMA and synthesis without meta-analysis (SWiM) guidelines. We extracted data on the impact of self-isolation on wellbeing, and factors associated with and interventions targeting wellbeing during self-isolation. Thirty-six studies were included. The mode quality rating was 'high-risk'. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were most investigated. Evidence for an impact of self-isolation on wellbeing was often inconsistent in quantitative studies, although qualitative studies consistently reported a negative impact. People with pre-existing mental and physical health needs reported increased symptoms of mental ill health during self-isolation. Studies reported modifiable stressors that have been reported in previous infectious disease contexts, such as inadequate support, poor coping strategies, inadequate and conflicting information, and highlighted the importance of regular contact from trusted healthcare professionals. Interventions targeting psychological wellbeing were rare and evaluative studies of these had high or very high risk of bias. When implementing self-isolation directives, public health officials should prioritise support for individuals who have pre-existing mental or physical health needs, lack support, or who are facing significant life stressors. Focus should be directed toward interventions that address loneliness, worries, and misinformation, whilst monitoring and identifying individuals in need of additional support.",10.1371/journal.pone.0310851,"['Alex F Martin', 'Louise E Smith', 'Samantha K Brooks', 'Madeline V Stein', 'Rachel Davies', 'Richard Amlôt', 'Neil Greenberg', 'Gideon James Rubin']",N/A,PloS one,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
The value of initiating a pursuit in temporal decision-making.,"Reward-rate maximization is a prominent normative principle in behavioral ecology, neuroscience, economics, and AI. Here, we identify, compare, and analyze equations to maximize reward rate when assessing whether to initiate a pursuit. In deriving expressions for the value of a pursuit, we show that time's cost consists of both apportionment and opportunity cost. Reformulating value as a discounting function, we show precisely how a reward-rate-optimal agent's discounting function (1) combines hyperbolic and linear components reflecting apportionment and opportunity costs, and (2) is dependent not only on the considered pursuit's properties but also on time spent and rewards obtained outside the pursuit. This analysis reveals how purported signs of suboptimal behavior (hyperbolic discounting, and the Delay, Magnitude, and Sign effects) are in fact consistent with reward-rate maximization. To better account for observed decision-making errors in humans and animals, we then analyze the impact of misestimating reward-rate-maximizing parameters and find that suboptimal decisions likely stem from errors in assessing time's apportionment-specifically, underweighting time spent outside versus inside a pursuit-which we term the 'Malapportionment Hypothesis'. This understanding of the true pattern of temporal decision-making errors is essential to deducing the learning algorithms and representational architectures actually used by humans and animals.",10.7554/eLife.99957,"['Elissa Sutlief', 'Charlie Walters', 'Tanya Marton', 'Marshall G Hussain Shuler']",2025-Mar,eLife,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
Layer 6 corticocortical neurons are a major route for intra- and interhemispheric feedback.,"The neocortex comprises anatomically discrete yet interconnected areas that are symmetrically located across the two hemispheres. Determining the logic of these macrocircuits is necessary for understanding high level brain function. Here in mice, we have mapped the areal and laminar organization of the ipsi- and contralateral cortical projection onto the primary visual, somatosensory, and motor cortices. We find that although the ipsilateral hemisphere is the primary source of cortical input, there is substantial contralateral symmetry regarding the relative contribution and areal identity of input. Laminar analysis of these input areas show that excitatory Layer 6 corticocortical cells (L6 CCs) are a major projection pathway within and between the two hemispheres. Analysis of the relative contribution of inputs from supra- (feedforward) and infragranular (feedback) layers reveals that contra-hemispheric projections reflect a dominant feedback organization compared to their ipsi-cortical counterpart. The magnitude of the interhemispheric difference in hierarchy was largest for sensory and motor projection areas compared to frontal, medial, or lateral brain areas due to a proportional increase in input from L6 neurons. L6 CCs therefore not only mediate long-range cortical communication but also reflect its inherent feedback organization.",10.7554/eLife.100478,"['Simon Weiler', 'Manuel Teichert', 'Troy W Margrie']",2025-Mar,eLife,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
A Flexible Spatio-Temporal Architecture Design for Artifact Removal in EEG with Arbitrary Channel-Settings.,"Electroencephalography (EEG) data is easily contaminated by various sources, significantly affecting subsequent analyses in neuroscience and clinical applications. Therefore, effective artifact removal is a key step in EEG preprocessing. While current deep learning methods have demonstrated notable efficacy in EEG denoising, single-channel approaches primarily focus on temporal features and neglect inter-channel correlations. Meanwhile, multi-channel methods mainly prioritize spatial features but often overlook the unique temporal dependencies of individual channels. A common limitation of both single-channel and multi-channel methods is their strict requirements on the input channel setting, which restricts their practical applicability. To address these issues, we design a flexible architecture named Artifact removal Spatio-Temporal Integration Network (ASTI-Net), a dual-branch denoising model capable of handling arbitrary EEG channel settings. ASTI-Net utilizes spatio-temporal attention weighting with dual branches that capture inter-channel spatial characteristics and intra-channel temporal dependencies. Its architecture incorporates deformable convolutional operations and channel-wise temporal processing, accommodating varying numbers of EEG channels and enhancing applicability across diverse clinical and research settings. By integrating features from both branches through a fusion reconstruction module, ASTI-Net effectively restores clean multi-channel EEG. Extensive evaluation on two semi-simulated datasets, along with qualitative assessment on real task-state EEG data, validates that ASTI-Net outperforms existing artifact removal methods.",10.1109/JBHI.2025.3555813,"['Yilin Han', 'Aiping Liu', 'Heng Cui', 'Xun Chen']",2025-Mar,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
Imaging of musculoskeletal injury: timing estimation and medico-legal issues.,"Musculoskeletal imaging plays a pivotal role in the evaluation of trauma, with applications spanning medical, forensic, and insurance contexts. Precisely dating musculoskeletal injuries is vital for reconstructing the timeline of events leading to trauma and verifying their accuracy. In forensic medicine, radiologists are frequently called upon by law enforcement and insurance companies to estimate the age of such injuries. This review aims to provide an overview of musculoskeletal imaging findings that can be used in medico-legal issues related to trauma to reach a comprehensive understanding of the causal relationship between the traumatic event and the clinical findings, with a particular focus on assessing causality, timing estimation and post-traumatic injury and impairment. Imaging plays a pivotal role in the precise and comprehensive evaluation of musculoskeletal traumatic injuries, with applications extending from immediate clinical care to legal and insurance considerations. Through various imaging modalities, it is possible to estimate the time elapsed since the injury and assess the impact of any pre-existing conditions. Effective collaboration between the forensic physician and the radiologist is essential to accurately determine the causal link between the injurious event and the resulting damage. This interdisciplinary approach ensures appropriate compensation and addresses the complex forensic aspects involved.",10.1007/s11547-025-01990-4,"['Giuseppe Davide Albano', 'Antonina Argo', 'Stefania Zerbo', 'Carlotta Scavone', 'Francesco Vitale', 'Carmelo Messina', 'Salvatore Gitto', 'Silvia Albano', 'Mauro Midiri', 'Paolo Vitali', 'Francesca Serpi', 'Giuseppe Lo Re', 'Massimo Galia', 'Cristina Cattaneo', 'Luca Maria Sconfienza', 'Domenico Albano']",2025-Mar,La Radiologia medica,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
Time restricted feeding with or without ketosis influences metabolism-related gene expression in a tissue-specific manner in aged rats.,"Many of the ""hallmarks of aging"" involve alterations in cellular and organismal metabolism. One pathway with the potential to impact several traditional markers of impaired function with aging is the PI3K/AKT metabolic pathway. Regulation of this pathway includes many aspects of cellular function, including protein synthesis, proliferation, and survival, as well as many downstream targets, including mTOR and FOXOs. Importantly, this pathway is pivotal to the function of every organ system in the human body. Thus, we investigated the expression of several genes along this pathway in multiple organs, including the brain, liver, and skeletal muscle, in aged subjects that had been on different experimental diets to regulate metabolic function since mid-life. Specifically, rats were fed a control ad lib diet (AL), a time restricted feeding diet (cTRF), or a time restricted feeding diet with ketogenic macronutrients (kTRF) for the majority of their adult lives (from 8 to 25 months). We previously reported that regardless of macronutrient ratio, TRF-fed rats in both macronutrient groups required significantly less training to acquire a biconditional association task than their ad lib fed counterparts. The current experiments expand on this work by quantifying metabolism-related gene expression across tissues and interrogating for potential relationships with cognitive performance. Within the brain, SIRT1 and MAPK8 were reduced in CA3 of kTRF-fed rats. Additionally, IGF1 expression was significantly upregulated in the CA1 of cTRF-fed rats, but this effect was ameliorated in the kTRF fed group. AKT and FOXO1 expression were significantly reduced in kTRF-fed rats within liver. Interestingly, AKT expression within the perirhinal cortex (PER) was higher in kTRF rats with the best cognitive performance, and FOXO1 expression was higher in the CA3 of AL-fed rats correlated with the poorest cognitive performance. Together, these data demonstrate diet- and tissue-specific alterations in metabolism-related gene expression and their correlation with cognitive status.",10.1007/s11357-025-01632-7,"['Sarah Ding', 'Anisha Banerjee', 'Sara N Burke', 'Abbi R Hernandez']",2025-Mar,GeroScience,"['Schizophrenia', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Humans', 'Monocytes', 'Humans', 'Dementia', 'Primary Health Care', 'England', 'Female', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Caregivers', 'Wales', 'Health Personnel', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Mental Health', 'Adult', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Isolation', 'Pandemics', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Reward', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Animals', 'Time Factors', 'Animals', 'Mice', 'Neurons', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Motor Cortex', 'Female', 'Neocortex', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']"
