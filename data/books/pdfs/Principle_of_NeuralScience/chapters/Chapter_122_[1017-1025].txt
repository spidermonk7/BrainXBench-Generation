The Biology of Emotion, 
Motivation, and Homeostasis
E
motional and homeostatic behaviors all involve  the 
coordination of one or more somatic, autonomic, hormonal, or 
cognitive processes. Subcortical brain regions concerned with a 
range of functions—including feeding, drinking, heart rate, breath-
ing, temperature regulation, sleep, sex, and facial expressions—play 
a critical role in this coordination. Subcortical brain regions are bidi-
rectionally connected with cortical brain areas, providing a means 
for reperesentations of internal state variables (eg, visceral informa-
tion) to influence cognitive operations, such as subjective feelings, 
decision-making, and attention, and for cognitive functions to regu-
late or extinguish neural representations in subcortical brain areas 
that help coordinate behavior reflecting emotional states.
Our consideration of these systems begins with the brain stem, a 
structure critical for wakefulness and conscious attention on the one 
hand and sleep on the other. The significance of this small region of 
the brain—located between the spinal cord and the diencephalon—is 
disproportionate to its size. Damage to the brain stem can profoundly 
affect motor and sensory processes because it contains all of the 
ascending tracts that bring sensory information from the surface of 
the body to the cerebral cortex and all of the descending tracts from 
the cerebral cortex that deliver motor commands to the spinal cord. 
Finally, the brain stem contains neurons that control respiration and 
heartbeat as well as nuclei that give rise to most of the cranial nerves 
that innervate the head and neck.
Six neurochemical modulatory systems in the brain stem modu-
late sensory, motor, and arousal systems. The dopaminergic path-
ways that connect the midbrain to the limbic system and cortex are 
particularly important, because they are involved in processing stim-
uli and events in relation to reinforcement expectation, and therefore 
contribute to motivational state and learning. Addictive drugs such 
as nicotine, alcohol, opiates, and cocaine are thought to produce their 
actions by co-opting the same neural pathways that positively rein-
force behaviors essential for survival. Other modulatory transmitters

regulate sleep and wakefulness, in part by controlling information 
flow between the thalamus and cortex. Disorders of electrical excita-
tion in corticothalamic circuits can result in seizures and epilepsy.
Rostral to the brain stem lies the hypothalamus, which func-
tions to maintain the stability of the internal environment by keep-
ing physiological variables within the limits favorable to vital bodily 
processes. Homeostatic processes in the nervous system have pro-
found consequences for behavior that have intrigued many of the 
founders of modern physiology, including Claude Bernard, Walter 
B. Cannon, and Walter Hess. Neurons controlling the internal envi-
ronment are concentrated in the hypothalamus, a small area of the 
diencephalon that comprises less than 1% of the total brain volume. 
The hypothalamus, with closely linked structures in the brain stem  
and limbic system, acts directly on the internal environment, through 
its control of the endocrine system and autonomic nervous system, 
to achieve goal-directed behavior. It acts indirectly through its con-
nections to higher brain regions to modulate emotional and moti-
vational states. In addition to influencing motivated behaviors, the 
hypothalamus, together with the brain stem below and the cerebral 
cortex above, maintains a general state of arousal, which ranges from 
excitement and vigilance to drowsiness and stupor.
The neurobiological investigation of emotion has relied on exper-
iments that define emotions in terms of specific measures ranging 
from subjective reports of feelings in humans, to approach or defen-
sive behaviors, to physiological responses such as autonomic reac-
tivity. Charles Darwin observed in his seminal book The Expression of 
the Emotions in Man and Animals that many emotions are conserved 
across species, making clear the relevance of studying emotions by 
using animal models to probe neural mechansisms. In experimental 
frameworks, emotional states are thereby considered to be central 
brain states that can cause coordinated behavioral, physiological, 
and cognitive responses across species.
In recent years, much work on emotion has focused on the amyg-
dala, which can orchestrate different responses via its connections to 
the cortex, hypothalamus, and brain stem. Lesions of the amygdala 
in humans impair fear learning and expression, as well as fear recog-
nition in others, due to decreased allocation of attention to features 
of faces that communicate fear. Symptoms in a variety of psychiat-
ric disorders—ranging from addiction to anxiety to social deficits—
likely involve amygdala dysfunction. However, the amygdala is 
only one component of a larger set of brain regions that includes 
parts of the hypothalamus, the brain stem, and cortical areas also 
responsible for coordinating emotional responses. In particular, the 
medial and ventral prefrontal cortex and amygdala are closely inter-
connected. Dynamic processing within and between these structures 
likely subserves many functions beyond coordinated emotional 
behavior, including extinction, the cognitive regulation of emotional

states, interactions between social and emotional domains, and the 
influence of the amgydalar representations on decision-making and 
subjective feelings.
