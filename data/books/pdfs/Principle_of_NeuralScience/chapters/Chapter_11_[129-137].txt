The thalamus is an important step in the hierarchy 
of sensory processing, not a passive relay station where 
information is simply passed on to the neocortex. It is 
a complex brain region where substantial information 
processing takes place (Figure 4–1). To give but one 
example, the output of somatosensory information 
from the ventral posterior lateral nucleus is subject to 
four types of processing: (1) local processing within the 
nucleus; (2) modulation by brain stem inputs, such as 
from the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems; (3) 
inhibitory input from the reticular nucleus; and (4) 
modulatory feedback from the neocortex.
Sensory Information Processing Culminates in 
the Cerebral Cortex
Somatosensory information from the ventral poste-
rior lateral nucleus is conveyed mainly to the primary 
somatosensory cortex (Figure 4–1). The neurons here 
are exquisitely sensitive to tactile stimulation of the 
skin surface. The somatosensory cortex, like earlier 
stages in tactile sensory processing, is somatotopically 
organized (Figure 4–8).
Figure 4–8  Homunculi illustrate the relative amounts of corti-
cal area dedicated to sensory and motor innervation of indi-
vidual parts of the body. The entire body surface is represented 
in an orderly array of somatosensory inputs in the cortex. (From 
Penfield and Rasmussen 1950. Reproduced by permission of the 
Osler Library of the History of Medicine, McGill University.)
A.  The area of cortex dedicated to processing sensory information 
from a particular part of the body is not proportional to the mass of 
the body part but instead reflects the density of sensory receptors 
in that part. Thus, sensory input from the lips and hands occupies 
more area of cortex than, say, that from the elbow.
B.  Output from the motor cortex is organized in similar fashion. 
The amount of cortical surface dedicated to a part of the body 
is related to the degree of motor control of that part. Thus, in 
humans, much of the motor cortex is dedicated to controlling 
the muscles of the fingers and the muscles related to speech.

Fingers
When the neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield stimu-
lated the surface of the somatosensory cortex in 
patients undergoing brain surgery in the late 1940s and 
early 1950s, he found that sensation from the lower 
limbs is mediated by neurons located near the midline 
of the brain, whereas sensations from the upper body, 
hands and fingers, face, lips, and tongue are medi-
ated by neurons located laterally. Penfield found that, 
although all parts of the body are represented in the 
cortex somatotopically, the amount of surface area of 
cortex devoted to each body part is not proportional 
to its mass. Instead, it is proportional to the fineness 
of discrimination in the body part, which in turn is 
related to the density of innervation of sensory fib-
ers (Chapter 19). Thus, the area of cortex devoted to  
the fingers is larger than that for the arms. Likewise, 
the representation of the lips and tongue occupies 
more cortical surface than that of the remainder of the 
face (Figure 4–8). As we shall see in Chapter 53, the 
amount of cortex devoted to a particular body part is 
not fixed but can be modified by experience, as seen in 
concert violinists, where there is an expansion of the 
region of somatosensory cortex devoted to the fingers 
of the hand used to finger the strings. This illustrates

an important aspect of brain circuitry: It is capable 
of plastic changes in response to use or disuse. Such 
changes are important for various forms of learning, 
including the ability to recover function after a stroke.
The region of cerebral cortex nearest the surface 
of the brain is organized in layers and columns, an 
arrangement that increases its computational effi-
ciency. The cortex has undergone dramatic expansion 
in evolution. The more recent neocortex comprises 
most of the cortex of mammals. In larger brains of pri-
mates and cetaceans, the neocortical surface is a sheet 
that is folded with deep wrinkles, thus allowing for 
three times more cortical surface to be packed into an 
only modestly enlarged head. Indeed, approximately 
two-thirds of the neocortex is along the deep wrinkles 
of the cortex, termed sulci. The remainder of neocortex 
is at the external folds of the sheet, termed gyri. The 
neocortex receives inputs from the thalamus, other corti-
cal regions on both sides of the brain, and other subcor-
tical structures. Its output is directed to other regions 
of the cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, pontine nuclei, 
and spinal cord.
These complex input–output relationships are effi-
ciently organized in the orderly layering of cortical neu-
rons; each layer contains different inputs and outputs. 
Many regions of the neocortex, in particular the primary 
sensory areas, contain six layers, numbered from the 
outer surface of the brain to the white matter (Figure 4–9).
Layer I, the molecular layer, is occupied by the 
dendrites of cells located in deeper layers and axons 
that travel through this layer to make connections in 
other areas of the cortex.
Figure 4–9  The neurons of the neocortex are arranged in 
distinctive layers. The appearance of the neocortex depends 
on what is used to stain it. The Golgi stain (left) reveals a 
subset of neuronal cell bodies, axons, and dendritic trees. 
The Nissl method (middle) shows cell bodies and proximal 
dendrites. The Weigert stain (right) reveals the pattern of mye-

Layers II and III contain mainly small pyramidal 
shaped cells. Layer II, the external granular cell layer, is 
one of two layers that contain small spherical neurons. 
Layer III is called the external pyramidal cell layer (an 
internal pyramidal cell layer lies at a deeper level). The 
neurons located deeper in layer III are typically larger 
than those located more superficially. The axons of 
pyramidal neurons in layers II and III project locally to 
other neurons within the same cortical area as well as 
to other cortical areas, thereby mediating intracortical 
communication (Figure 4–10).
Layer IV contains a large number of small spheri-
cal neurons and thus is called the internal granular cell 
layer. It is the main recipient of sensory input from the 
thalamus and is most prominent in primary sensory 
areas. For example, the region of the occipital cortex that 
functions as the primary visual cortex has an extremely 
prominent layer IV. Layer IV in this region is so heavily 
populated by neurons and so complex that it is typically 
divided into three sublayers. Areas with a prominent 
layer IV are called granular cortex. In contrast, the 
precentral gyrus, the site of the primary motor cortex, 
has essentially no layer IV and is thus part of the so-
called agranular frontal cortex. These two cortical areas 
are among the easiest to identify in histological sections 
(Figure 4–11).
Layer V, the internal pyramidal cell layer, contains 
mainly pyramidally shaped cells that are typically 
larger than those in layer III. Pyramidal neurons in this 
layer give rise to the major output pathways of the cor-
tex, projecting to other cortical areas and to subcortical 
structures (Figure 4–9).
The neurons in layer VI are fairly heterogeneous in 
shape, so this layer is called the polymorphic or mul-
tiform layer. It blends into the white matter that forms 
the deep limit of the cortex and carries axons to and 
from areas of cortex.
The thickness of individual layers and the details 
of their functional organization vary throughout the 
cortex. An early student of the cerebral cortex, Korbin-
ian Brodmann, used the relative prominence of the lay-
ers above and below layer IV, cell size, and packing 
Figure 4–10  Neurons in different layers of neocortex  
project to different parts of the brain. Projections to all other 
parts of the neocortex, the so-called corticocortical or associational 
connections, arise primarily from neurons in layers II and III.  
Projections to subcortical regions arise mainly from layers V and VI.

characteristics to distinguish different areas of the neo-
cortex. Based on such cytoarchitectonic differences, in 
1909, Brodmann divided the cerebral cortex into 47 
regions (Figure 4–11).
Although Brodmann’s demarcation coincides in part 
with information on localized functions in the neocortex, 
the cytoarchitectonic method alone does not capture the 
subtlety or variety of function of all the distinct regions 
of the cortex. For example, Brodmann identified five 
regions (areas 17–21) as being concerned with visual 
function in the monkey. In contrast, modern connectional 
neuroanatomy and electrophysiology have identified 
more than 35 functionally distinct cortical regions within 
the five regions recognized by Brodmann.
Figure 4–11  The extent of each cell layer of the neocortex 
varies throughout the cortex. Sensory areas of cortex, such 
as the primary visual cortex, tend to have a very prominent 
internal granular cell layer (layer IV), the site of sensory input. 
Motor areas of cortex, such as the primary motor cortex, have 
a very meager layer IV but prominent output layers, such as 
layer V. These differences led Korbinian Brodmann and others 
working at the turn of the 20th century to divide the cortex 
into various cytoarchitectonic regions. Brodmann’s 1909 sub-
division shown here is a classic analysis but was based on 
a single human brain. (Reproduced, with permission, from

Within the neocortex, information passes from 
one synaptic relay to another using feedforward and 
feedback connections. In the visual system, for exam-
ple, feedforward projections from the primary visual 
cortex to secondary and tertiary visual areas originate 
mainly in layer III and terminate mainly in layer IV 
of the target cortical area. In contrast, feedback projec-
tions to earlier stages of processing originate from cells 
in layers V and VI and terminate in layers I, II, and VI 
(Figure 4–12).
The cerebral cortex is organized functionally into 
columns of cells that extend from the white matter to 
the surface of the cortex. (This columnar organization 
is not particularly evident in standard histological 
preparations and was first discovered in electrophysi-
ological studies.) Each column is about one-third of a 
millimeter in diameter. The cells in each column form 
a computational module with a highly specialized 
function. Neurons within a column tend to have very 
similar response properties, presumably because 
they form a local processing network. The larger the 
area of cortex dedicated to a function, the greater the 
number of computational columns that are dedicated 
to that function (Chapter 23). The highly discrimina-
tive sense of touch in the fingers is a result of many 
cortical columns in the large area of cortex dedicated 
to processing somatosensory information from the 
hand.
Beyond the identification of the cortical column, a 
second major insight from the early electrophysiologi-
cal studies was that the somatosensory cortex contains 
not one but several somatotopic maps of the body sur-
face. The primary somatosensory cortex (anterior pari-
etal cortex) has four complete maps of the skin, one 
each in Brodmann areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 2. The thalamus 
sends, in parallel, a lot of deep receptor information 
(eg, from muscles) to area 3a and most of its cutane-
ous information to areas 3b and 1. Area 2 receives 
input from these thalamorecipient cortical areas and 
may be responsible for our integrated perception of 
three-dimensional solid objects, termed stereogno-
sis. Neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex 
project to neurons in adjacent areas, and these neu-
rons in turn project to other adjacent cortical regions  
(Figure 4–13). At higher levels in the hierarchy of 
cortical connections, somatosensory information is 
used in motor control, eye–hand coordination, and 
memory related to touch.
The cortical areas involved in the early stages of 
sensory processing are concerned primarily with a 
single sensory modality. Such regions are called pri-
mary sensory or unimodal (sensory) association areas. 
Information from the unimodal association areas con-
verges on multimodal association areas of the cortex 
concerned with combining sensory modalities (Figure 
4–13). These multimodal association areas, which are 
heavily interconnected with the hippocampus, appear 
to be particularly important for two functions: (1) the 
production of a unified percept and (2) the representa-
tion of the percept in memory (we will return to this at 
the end of this chapter).
Thus, from the mechanical pressure on a recep-
tor in the skin to the perception that a finger has been 
touched by a friend shaking your hand, somatosen-
sory information is processed in a series of increasingly 
more complex circuits (networks) from the dorsal root 
ganglia to the somatosensory cortex, to unimodal asso-
ciation areas, and finally to multimodal association 
areas. One of the primary purposes of somatosensory 
information is to guide directed movement. As one 
might imagine, there is a close linkage between the 
somatosensory and motor functions of the cortex.
Figure 4–12  Ascending and descending cortical pathways 
are distinguished by the organization of their origins and 
terminations within the cortical layers. Ascending or feed-
forward pathways generally originate in superficial layers of 
the cortex and invariably terminate in layer IV. Descending or 
feedback pathways generally originate from deep layers and 
terminate in layers I and VI. (Adapted, with permission, from

Figure 4–13  The processing of sensory information in the 
cerebral cortex begins with primary sensory areas, continues 
in unimodal association areas, and is further elaborated in 
multimodal association areas. Sensory systems also com-
municate with portions of the motor cortex. For example, the 
primary somatosensory cortex projects to the motor area in the 
frontal lobe and to the somatosensory association area in the 
parietal cortex. The somatosensory association area, in turn, 
projects to higher-order somatosensory association areas and to 
the premotor cortex. Information from different sensory systems 
converges in the multimodal association areas, which include the 
parahippocampal, temporal association, and cingulate cortices.

Voluntary Movement Is Mediated by Direct 
Connections Between the Cortex and Spinal Cord
As we shall see in Chapters 25 and 30, a major func-
tion of the perceptual systems is to provide the sensory 
information necessary for the actions mediated by the 
motor systems. The primary motor cortex is organized 
somatotopically like the somatosensory cortex (Figure 
4–8B). Specific regions of the motor cortex influence 
the activity of specific muscle groups (Chapter 34).
The axons of neurons in layer V of the primary 
motor cortex provide the major output of the neocor-
tex to control movement. Some layer V neurons influ-
ence movement directly through projections in the 
corticospinal tract to motor neurons in the ventral horn 
of the spinal cord. Others influence motor control by 
synapsing onto motor output nuclei in the medulla or 
onto striatal neurons in the basal ganglia. The human 
corticospinal tract consists of approximately one mil-
lion axons, of which approximately 40% originate in 
the motor cortex. These axons descend through the 
subcortical white matter, the internal capsule, and the 
cerebral peduncle in the midbrain (Figure 4–14). In 
the medulla, the fibers form prominent protuberances 
on the ventral surface called the medullary pyramids, 
and thus the entire projection is sometimes called the 
pyramidal tract.
Like the ascending somatosensory system, the 
descending corticospinal tract crosses to the opposite 
side of the spinal cord. Most of the corticospinal fibers 
cross the midline in the medulla at a location known as 
the pyramidal decussation. However, approximately 
10% of the fibers do not cross until they reach the level 
of the spinal cord at which they will terminate. The 
corticospinal fibers make monosynaptic connections 
with motor neurons, connections that are particularly 
important for individuated finger movements. They 
also form synapses with both excitatory and inhibitory 
interneurons in the spinal cord, connections that are 
important for coordinating larger groups of muscles in 
behaviors such as reaching and walking.
The motor information carried in the corticospinal 
tract is significantly modulated by both sensory infor-
mation and information from other motor regions. A 
continuous stream of tactile, visual, and proprioceptive 
information is needed to make voluntary movement 
both accurate and properly sequenced. In addition, 
the output of the motor cortex is under the substantial 
influence of other motor regions of the brain, includ-
ing the cerebellum and basal ganglia, structures that 
are essential for smoothly executed movements. These 
two subcortical regions, which are described in detail 
in Chapters 37 and 38, provide feedback essential for 
the smooth execution of skilled movements and thus 
are also important for the improvement in motor skills 
through practice (Figure 4–15).
Modulatory Systems in the Brain Influence 
Motivation, Emotion, and Memory
Some areas of the brain are neither purely sensory 
nor purely motor, but instead modulate specific sen-
sory or motor functions. Modulatory systems are often 
involved in behaviors that respond to a primary need 
such as hunger, thirst, or sleep. For example, sensory

and modulatory systems in the hypothalamus deter-
mine blood glucose levels (Chapter 41). When blood 
sugar drops below a certain critical level, we feel hun-
ger. To satisfy hunger, modulatory systems in the brain 
focus vision, hearing, and smell on stimuli that are rel-
evant to feeding.
Distinct modulatory systems within the brain stem 
modulate attention and arousal (Chapter 40). Small

nuclei in the brain stem contain neurons that synthe-
size and release the modulatory neurotransmitter nor-
epinephrine (the locus coeruleus) and serotonin (the 
dorsal raphe nucleus). Such neurons set the general 
arousal level of an animal through their widespread 
connections with forebrain structures. A group of 
cholinergic modulatory neurons, the basal nucleus of 
Meynert, is involved in arousal or attention (Chapter 40). 
This nucleus is located beneath the basal ganglia in the 
basal forebrain portion of the telencephalon. The axons 
of its neurons project to essentially all portions of the 
neocortex.
If a predator finds potential prey, a variety of cor-
tical and subcortical systems determine whether the 
prey is edible. Once food is recognized, other cortical 
and subcortical systems initiate a comprehensive vol-
untary motor program to bring the animal into contact 
with the prey, capture it and place it in the mouth, and 
chew and swallow.
Finally, the physiological satisfaction the animal 
experiences in eating reinforces the behaviors that led 
to the successful predation. A group of dopaminergic 
neurons in the midbrain are important for monitoring 
reinforcements and rewards. The power of the dopa-
minergic modulatory systems has been demonstrated 
by experiments in which electrodes were implanted 
into the reward regions of rats and the animals were 
freely allowed to press a lever to electrically stimu-
late their brains. They preferred this self-stimulation 
to obtaining food or water, engaging in sexual behav-
ior, or any other naturally rewarding activity. The 
role of the dopaminergic modulatory system in learn-
ing through reinforcement of exploratory behavior is 
described in Chapter 38.
How the brain’s modulatory systems, concerned 
with reward, attention and motivation, interact with 
the sensory and motor systems is one of the most 
interesting questions in neuroscience, one that is also 
fundamental to our understanding of learning and 
memory storage (Chapter 40).
The Peripheral Nervous System Is 
Anatomically Distinct From the Central 
Nervous System
The peripheral nervous system supplies the central 
nervous system with a continuous stream of infor-
mation about both the external environment and the 
internal environment of the body. It has somatic and 
autonomic divisions (Figure 4–16).
The somatic division includes the sensory neurons 
that receive information from the skin, muscles, and 
Figure 4–16  The peripheral nervous system has somatic 
and autonomic divisions. The somatic division carries infor-
mation from the skin to the brain and from the brain to mus-
cles. The autonomic division regulates involuntary functions, 
including activity of the heart and smooth muscles in the gut 
and glands.
