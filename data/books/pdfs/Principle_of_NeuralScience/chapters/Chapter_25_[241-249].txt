Figure 9–4  The resting potential of a cell is determined by 
the proportions of different types of ion channels that are 
open, together with the value of their equilibrium poten-
tials. The channels in the figures represent the entire comple-
ment of K+ or Na+ channels in this hypothetical cell membrane. 
The lengths of the arrows within the channels represent the 
relative amplitudes of the electrical (red) and chemical (blue) 
driving forces acting on Na+ or K+. The lengths of the arrows 
in the diagram on the right denote the relative sizes of the net 
driving force (the sum of the electrical and chemical driving 
forces) for Na+ and K+ and the net ion currents. Three  
hypothetical situations are illustrated.
A. In a resting cell in which only K+ channels are present, K+ 
ions are in equilibrium and Vm = EK.
B. Adding a few Na+ channels to the resting membrane allows 
Na+ ions to diffuse into the cell, and this influx begins to depo-
larize the membrane.
C. The resting potential settles at a new level (Vr), where the 
influx of Na+ is balanced by the efflux of K+. In this example, the 
aggregate conductance of the K+ channels is much greater than 
that of the Na+ channels because the K+ channels are more 
numerous. As a result, a relatively small net driving force for K+ 
drives a current equal and opposite to the Na+ current driven by 
the much larger net driving force for Na+. This is a steady-state 
condition, in which neither Na+ nor K+ is in equilibrium but the 
net flux of charge is null.

tions illustrated in parts A, B, and C.

diffusion mechanisms discussed earlier. During peri-
ods of intense neuronal activity, the increased influx 
of Na+ leads to an increase in Na+-K+ pump activity 
that generates a prolonged outward current, leading 
to a hyperpolarizing after-potential that can last for 
several minutes, until the normal Na+ concentration is 
restored. The Na+-K+ pump is inhibited by ouabain or 
digitalis plant alkaloids, an action that is important in 
the treatment of heart failure.
The Na+-K+ pump is a member of a large family 
of pumps known as P-type ATPases (because the phos-
phoryl group of ATP is temporarily transferred to the 
pump). P-type ATPases include a Ca2+ pump that trans-
ports Ca2+ across cell membranes (Figure 9–5A). All cells 
normally maintain a very low cytoplasmic Ca2+ con-
centration, between 50 and 100 nM. This concentration 
is more than four orders of magnitude lower than the 
external concentration, which is approximately 2 mM 
Figure 9–5  Pumps and transporters regulate the  
chemical concentration gradients of Na+, K+, Ca2+, and 
Cl− ions.
A. The Na-K+ pump and Ca2+ pump are two examples of active 
transporters that use the energy of adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP) hydrolysis to transport ions against their concentration 
gradient. The α-subunit of a Na-K+ pump or homologous Ca2+ 
pump (below) has 10 transmembrane segments, a cytoplas-
mic amino terminus, and a cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus. 
There are also cytoplasmic loops important for binding ATP 
(N), ATP hydrolysis and phosphorylation of the pump (P), and 
transducing phosphorylation to transport (A). The Na+-K+ pump 
also contains a smaller β-subunit with a single transmembrane 
domain plus a small accessory integral membrane protein 
FXYD, which modulates pump kinetics (not shown).
B. The Na+-Ca2+ exchanger uses the potential energy of the 
electrochemical gradient of Na+ to transport Ca2+ out of a cell. 
The Na+-Ca2+ exchanger contains nine transmembrane seg-
ments, two reentrant membrane loops important for ion trans-
port, and a large cytoplasmic regulatory loop. Chloride ions are 
transported into the cell by the Na+-K+-Cl− cotransporter and 
out of the cell by the K+-Cl− cotransporter. These transporters 
are members of a family of Cl− transport proteins with 12 trans-
membrane segments (below).

in mammals. Calcium pumps in the plasma membrane 
transport Ca2+ out of the cell; other Ca2+ pumps located 
in internal membranes, such as the smooth endoplas-
mic reticulum, transport Ca2+ from the cytoplasm into 
these intracellular Ca2+ stores. Calcium pumps are 
thought to transport two Ca2+ ions for each ATP mol-
ecule that is hydrolyzed, with two protons transported 
in the opposite direction.
The Na+-K+ pump and Ca2+ pump have similar 
structures. They are formed from 110 kD α-subunits, 
whose large transmembrane domain contains 10 
membrane-spanning α-helixes (Figure 9–5A). In the 
Na+-K+ pump, an α-subunit associates with an obliga-
tory β-subunit that is required for proper assembly and 
membrane expression of the pump. In humans, four 
genes encode highly related Na+-K+ pump α-subunits 
(ATP1A1, ATP1A2, ATP1A3, ATP1A4). Mutations in 
ATP1A2 result in familial hemiplegic migraine, a form

of migraine associated with an aura and muscle weak-
ness. Certain mutations in the neuron-specific ATP1A3 
isoform lead to rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism, a 
movement disorder that first occurs in late adolescence 
or early adulthood. A different set of mutations lead to 
a distinct neurological disorder, alternating hemiple-
gia of childhood, a paralysis that affects one side of the 
body and develops in children under the age of 2.
Most neurons have relatively few Ca2+ pumps in 
the plasma membrane. Instead, Ca2+ is transported 
out of the cell primarily by the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger  
(Figure 9–5B). This membrane protein is not an ATPase 
but a different type of molecule called a cotransporter. 
Cotransporters move one type of ion against its elec-
trochemical gradient by using the energy stored in the 
electrochemical gradient of a second ion. (The CLC 
Cl--H+ cotransporter discussed in Chapter 8 is a type 
of exchanger.) In the case of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, 
the electrochemical gradient of Na+ drives the efflux 
of Ca2+. The exchanger transports three or four Na+ 
ions into the cell (down the electrochemical gradient 
for Na+) for each Ca2+ ion it removes (against the elec-
trochemical gradient of Ca2+). Because Na+ and Ca2+ 
are transported in opposite directions, the exchanger 
is termed an antiporter. Ultimately, it is the hydrolysis 
of ATP by the Na+-K+ pump that provides the energy 
(stored in the Na+ gradient) to maintain the function of 
the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. For this reason, ion flux driven 
by cotransporters is often referred to as secondary active 
transport, to distinguish it from the primary active 
transport driven directly by ATPases.
Chloride Ions Are Also Actively Transported
So far, for simplicity, we have ignored the contribution 
of chloride (Cl−) to the resting potential. However, in 
most nerve cells, the Cl− gradient across the cell mem-
brane is controlled by one or more active transport 
mechanisms so that ECl differs from Vr. As a result, the 
presence of open Cl− channels will bias the mem-
brane potential toward its Nernst potential. Chloride 
transporters typically use the energy stored in the gra-
dients of other ions—they are cotransporters.
Cell membranes contain a number of different 
types of Cl− cotransporters (Figure 9–5B). Some trans-
porters increase intracellular Cl− to levels greater 
than those that would be passively reached if the Cl− 
Nernst potential was equal to the resting potential. In 
such cells, ECl is positive to Vr so that the opening of 
Cl− channels depolarizes the membrane. An example 
of this type of transporter is the Na+-K+-Cl− cotrans-
porter. This protein transports two Cl− ions into the cell 
together with one Na+ and one K+ ion. As a result, the 
transporter is electroneutral. The Na+-K+-Cl− cotrans-
porter differs from the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger in that the 
former transports all three ions in the same direction—
it is a symporter.
In most neurons, the Cl− gradient is determined by 
cotransporters that move Cl− out of the cell. This action 
lowers the intracellular concentration of Cl− so that ECl 
is typically more negative than the resting potential. 
As a result, the opening of Cl− channels leads to an 
influx of Cl− that hyperpolarizes the membrane. The 
K+-Cl− cotransporter is an example of such a transport 
mechanism; it moves one K+ ion out of the cell for each 
Cl− ion it exports.
Interestingly, in early neuronal development, 
cells tend to express primarily the Na+-K+-Cl− cotrans-
porter. As a result, at this stage the neurotransmitter 
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which activates ligand-
gated Cl− channels, typically has an excitatory (depo-
larizing) effect. As neurons develop, they begin to 
express the K+-Cl- cotransporter, such that in most 
mature neurons GABA typically hyperpolarizes the 
membrane and thus acts as an inhibitory neurotrans-
mitter. In some pathological conditions in adults, such 
as certain types of epilepsy or chronic pain syndromes, 
the expression pattern of the Cl− cotransporters may 
revert to that of the immature nervous system. This 
will lead to aberrant depolarizing responses to GABA 
that can produce abnormally high levels of excitation.
The Balance of Ion Fluxes in the Resting 
Membrane Is Abolished During the  
Action Potential
In the nerve cell at rest, the steady Na+ influx is balanced 
by a steady K+ efflux, so that the membrane potential 
is constant. This balance changes when the membrane 
is depolarized toward the threshold for an action 
potential. As the membrane potential approaches this 
threshold, voltage-gated Na+ channels open rapidly. 
The resultant increase in membrane conductance to 
Na+ causes the Na+ influx to exceed the K+ efflux once 
threshold is exceeded, creating a net influx of positive 
charge that causes further depolarization. The increase 
in depolarization causes still more voltage-gated Na+ 
channels to open, resulting in a greater influx of Na+, 
which accelerates the depolarization even further.
This regenerative, positive feedback cycle develops 
explosively, driving the membrane potential rapidly 
toward the Na+ equilibrium potential of +55 mV:

However, the membrane potential never quite reaches 
ENa because K+ efflux continues throughout the depo-
larization. A slight influx of Cl− into the cell also 
counteracts the depolarizing effect of the Na+ influx. 
Nevertheless, so many voltage-gated Na+ channels 
open during the rising phase of the action potential that 
the cell membrane’s Na+ conductance is much greater 
than the conductance of either Cl− or K+. Thus, at the 
peak of the action potential, the membrane potential 
approaches the Na+ equilibrium potential, just as at 
rest (when permeability to K+ is predominant), the 
membrane potential tends to approach the K+ equilib-
rium potential.
The Contributions of Different Ions to 
the Resting Membrane Potential Can Be 
Quantified by the Goldman Equation
Although K+, Na+, and Cl− fluxes set the value of the 
resting potential, Vm is not equal to EK, ENa, or ECl but 
lies at some intermediate value. As a general rule, 
when Vm is determined by two or more species of ions, 
the contribution of one species is determined not only 
by the concentrations of the ion inside and outside the 
cell but also by the ease with which the ion crosses the 
membrane.
One convenient measure of how readily the ion 
crosses the membrane is the permeability (P) of the 
membrane to that ion, which has units of velocity 
(cm/s). This measure is similar to that of a diffusion 
constant, which determines the rate of solute move-
ment in solution driven by a local concentration gradient. 
The dependence of membrane potential on ionic per-
meability and concentration is given by the Goldman 
equation:

This equation applies only when Vm is not chang-
ing. It states that the greater the concentration of an 
ion species and the greater its membrane permeabil-
ity, the greater is its contribution to determining the 
membrane potential. In the limit, when permeability 
to one ion is exceptionally high, the Goldman equation 
reduces to the Nernst equation for that ion. For example, if 
PK >> PCl or PNa, as in glial cells, the equation becomes 
as follows:

Alan Hodgkin and Bernard Katz used the Goldman 
equation to analyze changes in membrane potential 
in the squid giant axon. They measured the varia-
tions in membrane potential in response to systematic 
changes in the extracellular concentrations of Na+, Cl−, 
and K+. They found that if Vm is measured shortly after 
the extracellular concentration is changed (before the 
internal ionic concentrations are altered), [K+]o has a 
strong effect on the resting potential, [Cl−]o has a mod-
erate effect, and [Na+]o has little effect. The data for the 
membrane at rest could be fit accurately by the Gold-
man equation using the following permeability ratios:
PK : PNa : PCl = 1.0 : 0.04 : 0.45.
At the peak of the action potential, there is an instant in 
time when Vm is not changing and the Goldman equation 
is applicable. At that point, the variation of Vm with 
external ionic concentrations is fit best if a quite differ-
ent set of permeability ratios is assumed:
PK : PNa : PCl = 1.0 : 20 : 0.45.
For these values of permeability, the Goldman equation 
approaches the Nernst equation for Na+:

Thus, at the peak of the action potential, when the 
membrane is much more permeable to Na+ than to any 
other ion, Vm approaches ENa. However, the finite per-
meability of the membrane to K+ and Cl− results in K+ 
efflux and Cl− influx that partially counterbalance Na+ 
influx, thereby preventing Vm from quite reaching ENa.
The Functional Properties of the Neuron  
Can Be Represented as an Electrical  
Equivalent Circuit
The utility of the Goldman equation is limited because 
it cannot be used to determine how membrane poten-
tial changes with time or distance within a neuron in 
response to a local change in permeability. It is also 
inconvenient for determining the magnitude of the 
individual Na+, K+, and Cl− currents. This information 
can be obtained using a simple mathematical model 
derived from electric circuit theory. The model, called 
an equivalent circuit, represents all of the important 
electrical properties of the neuron by a circuit consist-
ing of conductors or resistors, batteries, and capaci-
tors. Equivalent circuits provide us with an intuitive 
understanding as well as a quantitative description of 


===== Page 5 =====

how current caused by the movement of ions gener-
ates electrical signals in nerve cells.
The first step in developing an equivalent circuit is 
to relate the membrane’s discrete physical properties 
to its electrical properties. The lipid bilayer endows 
the membrane with electrical capacitance, the ability 
of an electrical nonconductor (insulator) to separate 
electrical charges on either side of it. The nonconduct-
ing phospholipid bilayer of the membrane separates 
the cytoplasm and extracellular fluid, both of which 
are highly conductive environments. The separation of 
charges on the inside and outside surfaces of the cell 
membrane (the capacitor) gives rise to the electrical 
potential difference across the membrane. The electri-
cal potential difference or voltage across a capacitor is
V = Q/C,
where Q is the net excess positive or negative charge 
on each side of the capacitor and C is the capacitance.
Capacitance is measured in units of farads (F), and 
charge is measured in coulombs (where 96,500 cou-
lombs of a univalent ion is equivalent to 1 mole of that 
ion). A charge separation of 1 coulomb across a capaci-
tor of 1 F produces a potential difference of 1 volt. A 
typical value of membrane capacitance for a nerve cell 
is approximately 1 μF per cm2 of membrane area. Very 
few charges are required to produce a significant poten-
tial difference across such a capacitance. For example, 
the excess of positive and negative charges separated 
by the membrane of a spherical cell body with a diam-
eter of 50 μm and a resting potential of −60 mV is  
29 × 106 ions. Although this number may seem large, it 
represents only a tiny fraction (1/200,000) of the total 
number of positive or negative charges in solution 
within the cytoplasm. The bulk of the cytoplasm and 
the bulk of the extracellular fluid are electroneutral.
The membrane is a leaky capacitor because it is 
studded with ion channels that can conduct charge. 
Ion channels endow the membrane with conductance 
and with the ability to generate an electrical potential 
difference. The lipid bilayer itself has effectively zero 
conductance or infinite resistance. However, because 
ion channels are highly conductive, they provide path-
ways of finite electrical resistance for ions to cross the 
membrane. Because neurons contain many types of 
channels selective for different ions, we must consider 
each class of ion channel separately.
In an equivalent circuit we can represent each K+ 
channel as a resistor or conductor of ionic current with 
a single-channel conductance γK (remember, conduct-
ance = 1/resistance) (Figure 9–6A). If there were no K+ 
concentration gradient, the current through a single K+ 
Figure 9–6  Chemical and electrical forces contribute to cur-
rent through an ion channel.
A. A concentration gradient for K+ gives rise to an electromo-
tive force, which has a value equal to EK, the Nernst potential 
for K+. This can be represented by a battery. In this circuit, the 
battery EK is in series with the conductor γK, representing the 
conductance of the K+ channel.

channel would be given by Ohm’s law: iK = γK × Vm. 
However, normally there is a K+ concentration gradi-
ent, and thus also a chemical force driving K+ across 
the membrane, represented in the equivalent circuit 
by a battery. (A source of electrical potential is called 
an electromotive force [EMF], and an electromotive force 
generated by a difference in chemical potentials is 
called a battery.) The electromotive force of this battery 
is given by EK, the Nernst potential for K+ (Figure 9–6).
In the absence of voltage across the membrane, the 
normal K+ concentration gradient causes an outward 
K+ current. According to our convention for current, an 
outward movement of positive charge across the mem-
brane corresponds to a positive current. According to 
the Nernst equation, when the concentration gradient 
for a positively charged ion, such as K+, is directed 


===== Page 6 =====
Chapter 9 / Membrane Potential and the Passive Electrical Properties of the Neuron    201
outward (ie, the K+ concentration inside the cell is 
higher than outside), the equilibrium potential for that 
ion is negative. Thus, the K+ current that flows solely 
because of its concentration gradient is given by iK = 
−γK × EK (the negative sign is required because a nega-
tive equilibrium potential produces a positive current 
at 0 mV).
Finally, for a real neuron that has both a membrane 
potential and a K+ concentration gradient, the net K+ 
current is given by the sum of the currents caused by 
the electrical and chemical driving forces:
           iK = (γK × Vm) − (γK × EK) = γK × (Vm − EK).     (9–1)
The factor (Vm − EK) is called the electrochemical 
driving force. It determines the direction of ionic cur-
rent and (along with the conductance) its magnitude. 
This equation is a modified form of Ohm’s law that 
takes into account the fact that ionic current through 
a membrane is determined not only by the voltage 
across the membrane but also by the ionic concentra-
tion gradients.
A cell membrane has many resting K+ channels, 
all of which can be combined into a single equivalent 
circuit element consisting of a conductor in series with 
a battery. In this equivalent circuit, the total conduct-
ance of all the K+ channels (gK), ie, the K+ conductance 
of the cell membrane in its resting state, is equal to the 
number of resting K+ channels (NK) multiplied by the 
conductance of an individual K+ channel (γK):
gK = NK × γK.
Because the battery in this equivalent circuit 
depends solely on the concentration gradient for K+ 
and is independent of the number of K+ channels, its 
value is the equilibrium potential for K+, EK.
Like the population of resting K+ channels, all the 
resting Na+ channels can be represented by a single 
conductor in series with a single battery, as can the 
resting Cl− channels. Because the K+, Na+, and Cl− chan-
nels account for the bulk of the passive ionic current 
through the membrane in the cell at rest, we can calcu-
late the resting potential by incorporating these three 
pathways into a simple equivalent circuit of a neuron 
(Figure 9–7).
To complete this circuit, we first connect the ele-
ments representing each type of channel at their two 
ends with elements representing the extracellular 
fluid and cytoplasm. The extracellular fluid and cyto-
plasm are both good conductors (compared with 
the membrane) because they have relatively large 
cross-sectional areas and many ions available to carry 
charge. In a small region of a neuron, the extracellular 
Figure 9–7  An equivalent circuit of passive and active 
current in a resting neuron. The total K+ conductance rep-
resented by the symbol gK is the product of γK × N, the total 
number of open K+ channels in the resting membrane. The total 
conductances for Na+ and Cl− channels are determined in a sim-
ilar fashion. Under steady-state conditions, the passive Na+ and 
K+ currents are balanced by active Na+ and K+ fluxes (I ′Na and  
I ′K) driven by the Na-K+ pump. The active Na+ flux (I ′Na) is 50% 
greater than the active K+ flux (I ′K) because the Na+-K+ pump 
transports three Na+ ions out for every two K+ ions it transports 
into the cell. As a result, for the cell to remain in a steady state, 
INa must be 50% greater than IK (arrow size is proportional to 
current magnitude). There is no current through the Cl− chan-
nels because in this example Vm is at ECl, the Cl− equilibrium 
potential.

and cytoplasmic resistances can be approximated by 
a short circuit—a conductor with zero resistance. The 
membrane capacitance (Cm) is determined by the insu-
lating properties of the lipid bilayer and its area.
Finally, the equivalent circuit can be made com-
plete by incorporating the active ion fluxes driven 
by the Na+-K+ pump, which extrudes three Na+ ions 
from the cell for every two K+ ions it pumps in. This 
electrogenic ATP-dependent pump, which keeps the 
ionic batteries charged, is represented in the equiva-
lent circuit by the symbol for a current generator  
(Figure 9–7). The use of the equivalent circuit to ana-
lyze neuronal properties quantitatively is illustrated in 
Box 9–2, where the equivalent circuit is used to calcu-
late the resting potential.
The Passive Electrical Properties of the  
Neuron Affect Electrical Signaling
Once an electrical signal is generated in part of a neu-
ron, for example in response to a synaptic input on 
a branch of a dendrite, it is integrated with the other 
inputs to the neuron and then propagated to the axon 
initial segment, the site of action potential genera-
tion. When synaptic potentials, receptor potentials, or 
action potentials are generated in a neuron, the mem-
brane potential changes rapidly.

Figure 9–8  The electrical 
equivalent circuit used to cal-
culate the resting membrane 
potential. In this example, it is 
assumed that the Cl− cotrans-
porter maintains intracellular 
Cl− at a relatively low value. As a 
result, the Cl− equilibrium poten-
tial is more negative than the 
resting potential.
An equivalent circuit model of the resting membrane can 
be used to calculate the resting potential (Figure 9–8).  
To simplify the calculation, we ignore the electrogenic 
influence of the Na+-K+ pump because it is small. 
We also ignore membrane capacitance because Vm is 
unchanging, so the charge on the capacitance is also not 
changing.
Because there are more resting channels for K+ than 
for Na+, the membrane conductance for K+ is much 
greater than that for Na+. In the equivalent circuit in  
Figure 9–8, gK (10 × 10−6 S) is 20 times higher than gNa 
(0.5 × 10−6 S). For most nerve cells, the value of gCl ranges 
from one-fourth to one-half of gK. In this example, gCl 
equals 4.0 × 10−6 S. Given these values and the values of 
EK, ECl, and ENa, we can calculate Vm as follows.
Since the membrane potential is constant, there is 
no net current through the three sets of ion channels:
                            IK+ ICl + INa = 0.                           (9–2)
We can easily calculate each current in two steps. 
First, we add up the separate potential differences across 
each branch of the circuit. For example, in the K+ branch, 
the total potential difference is the sum of the the battery 
EK and the voltage drop across gK given by Ohm’s law 
(Vm = IK/gK):*
Vm = EK + IK/gK
Similarly, for the Na+ and Cl− conductance branches:
Vm = ECl + ICl/gCl
Vm = ENa + INa/gNa
Next, we rearrange and solve for the ionic current I 
in each branch:
                     INa = gNa × (Vm − ENa)                        (9–3a)
                      IK = gK × (Vm − EK)                          (9–3b)
                      ICl = gCl × (Vm – ECl).                         (9–3c)
These equations are similar to Equation 9–1, in 
which the net current through a single ion channel 
is derived from the currents caused by the individual

*Because we have defined Vm as Vin − Vout, the following convention must be used for these equations. Outward current (in this case 
IK) is positive and inward current is negative. Batteries whose positive pole is directed toward the inside of the membrane (eg, ENa) 
are given positive values in the equations. The reverse is true for batteries whose negative pole is directed toward the inside, such 
as the K+ battery.
What determines the rate of change in potential 
with time or distance? What determines whether a 
stimulus will or will not produce an action potential? 
Here we consider the neuron’s passive electrical prop-
erties and geometry and how these relatively constant 
properties affect the cell’s electrical signaling. The 
actions of the gated channels and the ionic currents 
that change the membrane potential are described in 
the next five chapters.
Neurons have three passive electrical properties 
that are important for electrical signaling. We have 
already described the resting membrane conductance 
or resistance (gr = 1/Rr) and the membrane capaci-
tance, Cm. A third important property that determines 
signal propagation along dendrites or axons is their 
intracellular axial resistance (ra). Although the resistiv-
ity of cytoplasm is much lower than that of the mem-
brane, the axial resistance along the entire length of an

Figure 9–9  The Na+, K+, and Cl− resting channels can 
be simplified to a single conductance and battery. For 
an equivalent circuit model of the resting membrane (eg, 
Figure 9–8), the total membrane conductance (gr) is calcu-
lated from the sum of the Na+, K+, and Cl− conductances, 
and the value of the resting potential battery (Er) is calcu-
lated from Equation 9–4.
driving forces. As these equations illustrate, the ionic 
current through each conductance branch is equal to 
the conductance of that branch multiplied by the net 
electrochemical driving force. Thus, for the K+ current, 
the conductance is proportional to the number of open 
K+ channels, and the driving force is equal to the differ-
ence between Vm and EK. If Vm is more positive than EK  
(−75 mV), the driving force is positive and the current 
is outward; if Vm is more negative than EK, the driving 
force is negative and the current is inward.
Similar equations are used in a variety of contexts 
throughout this book to relate the magnitude of a par-
ticular ionic current to its membrane conductance and 
driving force.
As we saw in Equation 9–2, INa + IK + ICl = 0. If we 
now substitute Equations 9–3a,b,c for INa, IK, and ICl in 
Equation 9–2, multiply through, and rearrange, we 
obtain the following expression:
Vm × (gNa + gK + gCl) = (ENa × gNa) + (EK × gK)
+ (ECl × gCl).
Solving for Vm, we obtain an equation for the rest-
ing membrane potential that is expressed in terms of 
membrane conductances g and batteries E:

From this equation, using the values in our equiva-
lent circuit (Figure 9–8), we calculate that Vm = −70 mV.
Equation 9–4 states that Vm approaches the value 
of the ionic batteries that have the greater conductance. 
This principle can be illustrated by considering what 
happens during the action potential. At the peak of the 
action potential, gK and gCl are essentially unchanged 
from their resting values, but gNa increases as much as 
500-fold. This increase in gNa is caused by the opening 
of voltage-gated Na+ channels. In the equivalent circuit 
in Figure 9–8, a 500-fold increase would change gNa from 
0.5 × 10−6 S to 250 × 10−6 S.
If we substitute this new value of gNa into  
Equation 9–4 and solve for Vm, we obtain +48  mV. 
Vm is closer to ENa than to EK at the peak of the action 
potential because gNa is now 25-fold greater than gK 
and 62.5-fold greater than gCl, so that the Na+ battery 
becomes much more important than the K+ and Cl– 
batteries in determining Vm.
Equation 9–4 is similar to the Goldman equation in 
that the contribution to Vm of each ionic battery is weighted 
in proportion to the conductance of the membrane for that 
particular ion. In the limit, if the conductance for one ion is 
much greater than that for the other ions, Vm approaches 
the value of that ion’s Nernst potential.
The equivalent circuit can be further simplified by 
lumping the conductance of all the resting channels that 
contribute to the resting potential into a single conduct-
ance, gr, and replacing the battery for each conductance 
channel with a single battery Er, whose value is given by 
Equation 9–4 (Figure 9–9). Here the subscript r stands 
for the resting channel pathway. Because the resting 
channels provide a pathway for the steady leakage of 
ions across the membrane, they are sometimes referred 
to as leakage channels (Chapter 10). This consolidation of 
resting pathways will prove useful when we consider 
the effects on membrane voltage of current through volt-
age-gated and ligand-gated channels in later chapters.

extended thin neuronal process can be considerable. 
Because these three elements provide the return path-
way to complete the electrical circuit when active ionic 
currents flow into or out of the cell, they determine the 
time course of the change in synaptic potential gen-
erated by the synaptic current. They also determine 
whether a synaptic potential generated in a dendrite 
will depolarize the trigger zone at the axon initial seg-
ment enough to fire an action potential. Finally, the 
passive properties influence the speed at which an 
action potential is conducted.
Membrane Capacitance Slows the Time Course of 
Electrical Signals
The steady-state change in a neuron’s voltage in 
response to subthreshold current resembles the behav-
ior of a simple resistor, but the time course of the change

does not. A true resistor responds to a step change in 
current with a similar step change in voltage, but the 
neuron’s membrane potential rises and decays more 
slowly than the step change in current because of its 
capacitance (Figure 9–10).
To understand how the capacitance slows down 
the voltage response, recall that the voltage across a 
capacitor is proportional to the charge stored on the 
capacitor. To alter the voltage, charge Q must be added 
to or removed from the capacitor C:
ΔV = ΔQ/C.
To change the charge across the capacitor (the 
membrane lipid bilayer), there must be current across 
the capacitor (Ic). Since current is the flow of charge per 
unit time (Ic = ΔQ/Δt), the change in voltage across a 
capacitor is a function of the magnitude and duration 
of the current:
ΔV = Ic · Δt/C.
Thus, the magnitude of the change in voltage across 
a capacitor in response to a current pulse depends on 
the duration of the current, because time is required to 
deposit and remove charge from the capacitor.
If the membrane had only resistive properties, 
a step pulse of outward current would change the 
membrane potential instantaneously. Conversely, if 
the membrane had only capacitive properties, the 
membrane potential would change linearly with time

Figure 9–10  The rate of change in the membrane potential 
is slowed by the membrane capacitance. The upper plot 
shows the response of the membrane potential (ΔVm) to a step 
current pulse (Im). The shape of the actual voltage response 
(red line) combines the properties of a purely resistive element 
(dashed line a) and a purely capacitive element (dashed line 
b). The time taken to reach 63% of the final voltage defines 
the membrane time constant, τ. The lower plot shows the two 
elements of the total membrane current (Im) during the current 
pulse: the ionic current (Ii) across the resistive elements of the 
membrane (ion channels) and the capacitive current (Ic).
in response to the same step of current. Because the 
membrane has both capacitive and resistive properties 
in parallel, the actual change in membrane potential 
combines features of the two pure responses. The ini-
tial slope of the change reflects a purely capacitive ele-
ment, whereas the final slope and amplitude reflect a 
purely resistive element (Figure 9–10, upper plot).
In the simple case of the spherical cell body of a 
neuron, the time course of the potential change is 
described by the following equation:
ΔVm (t) = ImRm(1 − e–t/τ),
where e is the base of the system of natural logarithms 
with a value of approximately 2.72, and τ is the mem-
brane time constant, given by the product of the mem-
brane resistance and capacitance (RmCm). The time 
constant can be measured experimentally as the time 
it takes the membrane potential to rise to 1 − 1/e, or 
approximately 63% of its steady-state value (Figure 9–10, 
upper plot). Typical values of τ for neurons range from 
20 to 50 ms. We shall return to the time constant in 
Chapter 13 where we consider the temporal summa-
tion of synaptic inputs in a cell.
Membrane and Cytoplasmic Resistance Affect  
the Efficiency of Signal Conduction
So far, we have considered the effects of the passive 
properties of neurons on signaling only within the cell 
body. Distance is not a factor in the propagation of a 
signal in the neuron’s soma because the cell body can 
be approximated as a sphere whose membrane voltage 
is uniform. However, a subthreshold voltage signal 
traveling along extended structures (dendrites, axons, 
and muscle fibers) decreases in amplitude with dis-
tance from the site of initiation because some charge 
leaks out of the resting membrane conductance as it 
flows along the dendrite or axon. To show how this 
attenuation occurs, we will consider how the geometry 
of a neuron influences the distribution of current.
If current is injected into a dendrite at one point, 
how will the membrane potential change along its 
length? For simplicity, consider how membrane poten-
tial varies with distance after a constant-amplitude cur-
rent pulse has been on for some time (t >> τ). Under 
these conditions, the membrane capacitance is fully 
charged, so membrane potential reaches a steady value. 
The variation of the potential with distance depends 
on the fraction of charge that leaks out of the dendrite 
compared to the fraction that flows inside the dendrite 
towards the soma. Since charge flows along the path of 
least resistance, this depends on the relative values of 
the membrane resistance in a unit length of dendrite rm
