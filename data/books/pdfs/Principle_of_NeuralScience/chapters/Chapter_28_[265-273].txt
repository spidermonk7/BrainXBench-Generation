This all-or-none phenomenon may seem surprising 
when one considers that Na+ conductance increases 
in a strictly graded manner as depolarization increases 
(Figure 10–6). Each increment of depolarization 
increases the number of voltage-gated Na+ channels 
that open, thereby gradually increasing Na+ current. 
How then can there be a discrete threshold for generat-
ing an action potential?
Although a small subthreshold depolarization 
increases the inward INa, it also increases two outward 
currents, IK and Il, by increasing the electrochemical 
driving forces acting on K+ and Cl−. In addition, the 
depolarization augments K+ conductance by gradu-
ally opening more voltage-gated K+ channels (Figure 
10–6). As the outward K+ and leakage currents increase 
with depolarization, they tend to repolarize the mem-
brane and thereby resist the depolarizing action of 
the Na+ influx. However, because of the high voltage 
sensitivity and more rapid kinetics of activation of the 
Na+ channels, the depolarization eventually reaches 
the point at which the increase in inward INa exceeds 
the increase in outward IK and Il. At this point, there 
is a net inward ionic current. This produces a further 
depolarization, opening even more Na+ channels, so 
that the depolarization becomes regenerative, rapidly 
driving the membrane potential Vm all the way to the 
peak of the action potential. The specific value of Vm at 
which the net ionic current (INa + IK + Il) changes from 
outward to inward, depositing a positive charge on the 
inside of the membrane capacitance, is the threshold.
Early experiments with extracellular stimulation of 
nerve fibers showed that, for a short time after an action 
potential (typically a few milliseconds), it is impossible 
to generate another action potential. This absolute refrac-
tory period is followed by a period when it is possible 
to stimulate another action potential, but only with a 
stimulus larger than what was needed for the first. This 
relative refractory period typically lasts 5 to 10 ms.
The Hodgkin-Huxley analysis provided a mecha-
nistic explanation of two factors underlying the refrac-
tory period. In the immediate aftermath of an action 
potential, it is impossible to evoke another one, even 
with a very strong stimulus, because the Na+ channels 
remain inactivated. After repolarization, Na+ channels 
recover from inactivation and reenter the resting state, 
a transition that takes several milliseconds (Figure 10–8). 
The relative refractory period corresponds to partial 
recovery from inactivation.
The relative refractory period is also influenced by 
a residual increase in K+ conductance that follows the 
action potential. It takes several milliseconds for all of 
the K+ channels that open during the action potential 
to return to their closed state. During this period, when 
the K+ conductance remains somewhat elevated, Vm is 
slightly more negative than its normal resting value, as 
Vm approaches EK (Figure 10–7, Equation 9–4). This afte-
rhyperpolarization and residual increase in gK contribute 
to the increase in depolarizing current required to drive 
Vm to threshold during the relative refractory period.
The Mechanisms of Voltage Gating Have 
Been Inferred From Electrophysiological 
Measurements
The empirical equations derived by Hodgkin and 
Huxley are quite successful in describing how the flow 
of ions through the Na+ and K+ channels generates the 
action potential. However, these equations describe 
the process of excitation in terms of changes in mem-
brane conductance and current. They tell little about 
the mechanisms that activate or inactivate channels in 
response to changes in membrane potential or about 
channel selectivity for specific ions.
We now know that the voltage-dependent con-
ductances described by Hodgkin and Huxley are 
generated by ion channels that open in a voltage- and 
time-dependent manner. Patch-clamp recordings from 
a variety of nerve and muscle cells have provided 
detailed information about the properties of the volt-
age-dependent Na+ channels that generate the action 
potential. Recordings of single voltage-gated Na+ 
channels show that, in response to a depolarizing step, 
each channel opens in an all-or-none fashion, conduct-
ing brief current pulses of constant amplitude but vari-
able duration.
Each channel opening is associated with a current 
of about 1 pA (at voltages near −30 mV), and the open 
state is rapidly terminated by inactivation. Each chan-
nel behaves stochastically, opening after a variable time 
and staying open for a variable time before inactivat-
ing. If the openings of all the channels in a cell mem-
brane in response to a step depolarization are summed 
or the openings of a single channel to multiple trials of 
the same depolarization are summed (Figure 10–9), the 
result is an averaged current with the same time course 
as the macroscopic Na+ current recorded in voltage-
clamp experiments (see Figure 10–4B).
To explain how changes in membrane poten-
tial lead to an increase in Na+ conductance, Hodg-
kin and Huxley deduced from basic thermodynamic 
considerations that a conformational change in some 
membrane component that regulates the conductance 
must move charged particles through the membrane 
electric field. As a result, membrane depolarization 
would exert a force causing the charged particles to 
move, thereby opening the channel. For a channel with 
positively charged mobile particles, the depolarization 


===== Page 2 =====

would produce an outward movement of charge that 
should precede the opening of the channel. Upon 
membrane repolarization the charge would move in 
the opposite direction, closing the channel. Because 
the mobile charge movement is confined to the mem-
brane, it is a type of capacitive current. This gating 
charge movement was predicted to generate a small 
outward current (or gating current), which was later 
confirmed when the membrane current was examined 
using very sensitive techniques. Blocking the inward 
ionic current with tetrodotoxin revealed a small out-
ward capacitive current during the time the channels 
were activating (Figure 10–10A). In later experiments, 
this gating current (Ig) was progressively reduced by 
mutating the positively charged lysine and arginine 
residues in the four S4 transmembrane regions of the 
Na+ channel to neutral residues. Thus, the gating cur-
rent is produced by outward movement of the posi-
tively charged residues in the S4 regions through the 
membrane electric field (Chapter 8). Voltage-gated K+ 
and Ca2+ channels also generate gating currents during 
channel opening.

nels from inactivation. Left:

Recent experiments have shown that the four S4 
transmembrane regions of the Na+ channel move with 
different time courses. Movement of the S4 regions of 
the first three domains (DI, DII, DIII) occurs first and 
is associated with channel activation. Movement of 
the S4 region of domain IV occurs more slowly and is 
associated with inactivation. Inactivation of Na+ chan-
nels likely involves a series of conformational changes 
whereby outward movement of the S4 region of domain 
IV enables binding of the cytoplasmic linker connecting 
domains III and IV to a binding site near the intracellular 
ends of the pore-forming S6 helices, stabilizing a noncon-
ducting inactivated state of the pore (Figure 10–10B,C).
Control of channel activation by gating charges 
results in a characteristic feature of voltage-dependent 
channels: The conductance change occurs over a rela-
tively narrow range of Vm with a saturating value 
for larger depolarizations. When peak INa is meas-
ured over a wide range of Vm and then converted to 
a conductance, as illustrated in Figure 10–6, the volt-
age dependence of peak conductance has a sigmoid 
shape (Figure 10–11). Activation of voltage-dependent 


===== Page 3 =====
222    Part II / Cell and Molecular Biology of Cells of the Nervous System
sodium conductance begins at about −50 mV (near the 
threshold for action potential firing), reaches a mid-
point near −25 mV, and saturates at about 0 mV. The 
saturation of conductance occurs when the S4 regions 
of the entire population of Na+ channels have moved 
to the activated conformation.
The relationship of conductance to voltage can be 
approximately fit by the Boltzmann function, an equa-
tion from statistical mechanics that describes the dis-
tribution of a population of molecules that can exist 
in distinct states with different potential energies. In 
the case of Na+ channels, the channels move between 
closed and open states that differ in potential energy 
because of the work done when the S4 region gating 
charges move through the electric field of the mem-
brane (Figure 10–10C). The two parameters of the fitted 
Boltzmann curve, the midpoint and the slope factor, 
provide a convenient characterization of the voltage 
dependence with which channels open. The curve 
is steeper if more gating charge moves as channels 
convert between closed and open states. The voltage 
dependence of activation and inactivation of many 
other types of voltage-dependent channels can also be 
approximated by Boltzmann curves with characteristic 
midpoints and slopes.
Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels Select for 
Sodium on the Basis of Size, Charge, and 
Energy of Hydration of the Ion
In Chapter 8, we saw how the structure of the K+ channel 
pore could explain how such channels are able to select 
for K+ over Na+ ions. The narrow diameter of the K+ chan-
nel selectivity filter (around 0.3 nm) requires that a K+ or 
Na+ ion must shed nearly all of its waters of hydration 
to enter the channel, an energetically unfavorable event.
The energetic cost of dehydration of a K+ ion is well 
compensated by its close interaction with a cage of elec-
tronegative carbonyl oxygen atoms contributed by the 
peptide backbones of the four subunits of the K+ chan-
nel selectivity filter. Because of its smaller radius, a Na+ 
ion has a higher local electric field than does a K+ ion 
and therefore interacts more strongly with its waters of 
hydration than does K+. On the other hand, the small 
diameter of the Na+ ion precludes close interaction with 
the cage of carbonyl oxygen atoms in the selectivity fil-
ter; the resultant high energetic cost of dehydrating the 
Na+ ion excludes it from entering the channel.
How then does the selectivity filter of the Na+ chan-
nel select for Na+ over K+ ions? Bertil Hille deduced 
a model for the Na+ channel’s selectivity mecha-
nism from measurements of the channel’s relative 
Figure 10–9  Individual voltage-gated ion channels open in

gated Na+ channel is electrically isolated from the rest of the

trials from the set of 300, showing six openings of the channel

recorded in a conventional voltage-clamp record (see Figure

all-or-none opening and closing of a large number of Na+ chan-
nels. (Reproduced, with permission, from Sigworth and Neher

Figure 10–10  The opening and closing of the sodium chan-
nel are associated with a redistribution of charges.
A. When the membrane is depolarized, the Na+ current (INa) is 
activated and then inactivated. The activation of the Na+ current 
is preceded by a brief capacitive gating current (Ig), reflecting the 
outward movement of positive charges within the walls of the 
Na+ channels. To detect this small gating current, it is necessary 
to block the flow of ionic current through the Na+ and K+ chan-
nels and subtract the capacitive current that depolarizes the lipid 
bilayer. (Adapted, with permission, from Armstrong and Gilly 1979.)

tains positively charged arginine and lysine residues that form 
the gating charge of the channels. (Adapted, with permission,

C. Diagrams depict the redistribution of gating charge and posi-
tions of the activation and inactivation gates when the channel 
is at rest, open, and inactivated. The red cylinders represent the 
S4 regions containing the positive gating charges. Depolariza-
tion of the cell membrane from the resting state causes the 
gating charge to move outward. Outward movement of the 
S4 regions of domains I, II, and III is associated with activation 
(1–2), whereas slower movement of the S4 region of domain IV 
is associated with inactivation (2–3). The movement of the S4 
region of domain IV allows an intracellular loop between domains 
III and IV (depicted as a green rectangle) to bind to a docking site 
near the S6 helices at the inside of the pore, allosterically stabiliz-
ing an inactivated closed state. (Adapted from Ahern et al. 2016.)

permeability to a range of organic and inorganic cati-
ons. As we learned in Chapter 8, the channel behaves 
as if it contains a selectivity filter, or recognition site, 
which selects partly on the basis of size, thus acting as 
a molecular sieve (see Figure 8–1). Based on the size 
and hydrogen-bonding characteristics of the largest 
organic cation that could readily permeate the channel, 
Hille deduced that the selectivity filter has rectangular 
dimensions of 0.3 × 0.5 nm. This cross section is just 
large enough to accommodate one Na+ ion contacting 
one water molecule (see Figure 8–1). Because a K+ ion 
in contact with one water molecule is larger than the 
size of the selectivity filter, it cannot readily permeate.
According to Hille’s model, negatively charged 
carboxylic acid groups of glutamate or aspartate resi-
dues at the outer mouth of the pore perform the first 
step in the selection process by attracting cations and 
repelling anions. The negative carboxylic acid groups, 
as well as other oxygen atoms that line the pore, can 
substitute for waters of hydration, but the degree of 
effectiveness of this substitution varies among ion spe-
cies. The negative charge of a carboxylic acid is able to 
form a stronger coulombic interaction with the smaller 
Na+ ion than with the larger K+ ion. Because the Na+ 
channel is large enough to accommodate a cation in 
contact with several water molecules, the energetic cost 
of dehydration is not as great as it is in a K+ channel. As 
a result of these two features, the Na+ channel is able

Na+ currents.

Increases in peak gNa in response to a series of depolarizing

relation with the form gNa /gNa(max) = 1/ [1 + exp − (Vm − Vh)/k], 
where Vh = −24 mV is the midpoint of the activation curve and 
k = 5.5 is the “slope factor,” with units of mV, and gNa(max) is the 
maximal sodium conductance at positive voltages. The greater 
the number of gating charges that must move to open the 
channel, the smaller is the slope factor. The voltage depend-
ence of most voltage-gated channels can be fit by similar  
Boltzmann curves. (Data from Indira M. Raman.)

the key features of Hille’s model.
Individual Neurons Have a Rich Variety of 
Voltage-Gated Channels That Expand Their 
Signaling Capabilities
The basic mechanism of electrical excitability identi-
fied by Hodgkin and Huxley in the squid giant axon 
is common to most excitable cells: Voltage-gated chan-
nels conduct an inward Na+ current followed by an 
outward K+ current. However, we now know that the 
squid axon is unusually simple in expressing only two 
types of voltage-gated ion channels. In contrast, the 
genomes of both vertebrates and invertebrates include 
large families of voltage-gated Na+, K+, and Ca2+ chan-
nels encoded by sub-families of related genes that are 
widely expressed in different kinds of nerve and mus-
cle cells.
A neuron in the mammalian brain typically 
expresses a dozen or more different types of voltage-
gated ion channels. The voltage dependence and 
kinetic properties of various Na+, Ca2+, and K+ channels 
can differ widely. Moreover, the distribution of these 


===== Page 6 =====
Chapter 10 / Propagated Signaling: The Action Potential    225
channels varies between different types of neurons 
and even between different regions of a single neu-
ron. The great variety of voltage-gated channels in the 
membranes of most neurons enables a neuron to fire 
action potentials with a much greater range of frequen-
cies and patterns than is possible in the squid axon, and 
thus allows much more complex information-processing 
abilities and modulatory control than is possible with 
just two types of channels.
The Diversity of Voltage-Gated Channel Types Is 
Generated by Several Genetic Mechanisms
The conservative mechanism by which evolution 
proceeds—creating new structural or functional enti-
ties by duplicating, modifying, shuffling, and recom-
bining existing gene-coding sequences—is illustrated 
by the diversity and modular design of the members 
of the extended gene superfamily that encodes the 
voltage-gated Na+, K+, and Ca2+ channels. This family 
also includes genes that encode calcium-activated K+ 
channels, the hyperpolarization-activated HCN non-
selective cation channels, and a voltage-independent 
cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel important for 
phototransduction and olfaction.
The functional differences between these channels 
are produced by differences in amino acid sequences 
in their core transmembrane domains as well as by 
the addition of regulatory elements in cytoplasmic 
domains. For example, some K+ channels have a mech-
anism of inactivation mediated by a tethered plug 
formed by the cytoplasmic N-terminus of the channel 
protein, which binds to the inner mouth of the channel 
when the activation gate opens. The C-terminal cyto-
plasmic end of the channel proteins is a particularly 
rich locus for regulatory elements, including domains that 
bind either Ca2+ or cyclic nucleotides, enabling these 
agents to regulate channel gating. Inward-rectifying K+ 
channels, which are tetramers of subunits with only a 
P-region and flanking transmembrane regions, have an 
internal cation-binding site that produces rectification. 
When the cell is depolarized, cytoplasmic Mg2+ or posi-
tively charged polyamines (small organic molecules 
that are normal constituents of the cytoplasm) are elec-
trostatically driven to this binding site from the cyto-
plasm, plugging the channel (Figure 10–12).
Figure 10–12 represents large families of channels 
within which there is considerable structural and func-
tional diversity. Five different mechanisms contribute 
to diversity in voltage-gated channels.
1.	 Multiple genes encode related principal subu-
nits within each class of channel. For example, 
in mammalian neurons and muscle, at nine dif-
ferent genes encode voltage-gated Na+ channel 
α-subunits.
2.	 The four α-subunits that form a voltage-gated K+ 
channel (Figure 8–11) can be encoded by differ-
ent genes. After translation, the α-subunits are in 
some cases mixed and matched in various combi-
nations, thus forming different subclasses of het-
eromeric channels.
3.	 A single gene product may be alternatively spliced, 
resulting in variations in the messenger RNA 
(mRNA) molecules that encode the α-subunit.
4.	 The mRNA that encodes an α-subunit may be 
edited by chemical modification of a single nucle-
otide, thereby changing the composition of a sin-
gle amino acid in the channel subunit.
5.	 Principal pore-forming α-subunits of all chan-
nel types are commonly combined with different 
accessory subunits to form functionally different 
channel types.
These accessory subunits (often termed β-, γ-, or 
δ-subunits) may be either cytoplasmic or membrane-
spanning and can produce a wide range of effects 
on channel function. For example, some β-subunits 
enhance the efficiency with which the channel protein 
is transported from the rough endoplasmic reticulum 
to the membrane, as well determining its final destina-
tion on the cell surface. Other subunits can regulate the 
voltage sensitivity or kinetics of channel gating. In con-
trast to the α-subunits, there is no known homology 
among the β-, γ-, and δ-subunits from the three major 
subfamilies of voltage-gated channels.
These various sources of channel diversity also 
vary widely between different areas of the nervous 
system, between different types of neurons, and within 
different subcellular compartments of a given neuron. 
A corollary of this regional differentiation is that muta-
tions or epigenetic mechanisms that alter voltage-
gated channel function can have very selective effects 
on neuronal or muscular function. The result is a large 
array of neurological diseases called channelopathies 
(Chapters 57 and 58).
Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels
The α-subunits of mammalian voltage-dependent 
Na+ channels are encoded by nine genes. Three of the 
α-subunits encoded by these genes (Nav1.1, Nav1.2, 
and Nav1.6) are widely expressed in neurons in the 
mature mammalian brain, while four others have more 
restricted expression in neurons. Nav1.3 is strongly 
expressed early in development, with little expression 
in the mature brain, but can be reexpressed in injured

D. Cation channels gated by cyclic nucleotides have a cyclic

subclass of such channels includes the voltage-independent, 
cyclic nucleotide-gated channels important in the transduction 
of olfactory and visual sensory signals. Another subclass con-
sists of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated 
(HCN) channels important for pacemaker activity (see Figure 
10–15D). The P loops in these channels lack key amino acid resi-
dues required for K+ selectivity. As a result, these channels do 
not show a high degree of discrimination between Na+  
and K+.
E. Inward-rectifying K+ channels, which are gated by blocking 
particles available in the cytoplasm, are formed from a trun-
cated version of the basic building block, with only two

tissue, for example following spinal cord injury. Nav1.7 
channels are confined to autonomic and sensory neurons 
in the peripheral nervous system. Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 
channels are largely restricted to a subset of peripheral 
sensory neurons, with particularly prominent expres-
sion in pain-sensing primary sensory neurons (noci-
ceptors). Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.3, Nav1.6, and Nav1.7 
channels have generally similar voltage dependence 
and relatively fast activation and inactivation kinet-
ics compared to Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 channels. Nav1.4 
channels in skeletal muscle fibers and Nav1.5 channels 
in cardiac muscle conduct the voltage-gated Na+ current 
that generates action potentials in these tissues.
Although Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.6 are all 
widely expressed in mammalian central neurons, they 
are expressed in different proportions in different types 
of neurons. Nav1.1 channels are particularly strongly 
expressed in some inhibitory GABAergic interneu-
rons, and some loss-of-function mutations in Nav1.1 
channels can lead to epilepsy, as in Dravet syndrome, 
perhaps reflecting greater loss of excitability of inhibi-
tory neurons relative to excitatory neurons.
Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels
Virtually all neurons contain voltage-gated Ca2+ chan-
nels that open in response to membrane depolariza-
tion. A strong electrochemical gradient drives Ca2+ into 
the cell, so these channels give rise to an inward cur-
rent that helps depolarize the cell.
A single neuron typically expresses at least four 
or five different types of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels 
with different voltage dependence, kinetic properties, 
and subcellular localization. Calcium channels that 
are widely expressed in central and peripheral neu-
rons include Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 channels (collectively 
known as L-type channels), Cav2.1 (P/Q-type chan-
nels), Cav2.2 (N-type channels), and Cav2.3 (R-type 
channels). The various Cav1 and Cav2 family channels 
are collectively known as high-threshold or high-voltage 
activated (HVA) Ca2+ channels because activation gen-
erally requires relatively large depolarizations.
Members of the Cav3 family, collectively known as 
T-type or low-voltage activated (LVA) channels, are more 
selectively expressed in certain neurons. They are opened 
by small depolarizations (as negative as −65 mV) and 
undergo inactivation over tens of milliseconds. At 
normal resting potentials, Cav3 channels are typically 
inactivated. Hyperpolarization of the membrane volt-
age (as by inhibitory synaptic input) removes resting 
inactivation, which enables transient activation of 
the LVA channels following the hyperpolarization as 
the membrane voltage moves back toward its resting 
level. This activation can produce a regenerative depo-
larization that triggers a burst of Na+ action potentials, 
which terminates when the Cav3 channels inactivate. 
Such postinhibitory burst firing is common in some 
regions of the thalamus and can help drive synchro-
nized burst firing in neural circuits (see Figure 44–2). 
Similar rebound activation of Cav3 channels following 
the hyperpolarizing phase of a slow pacemaker poten-
tial contributes to spontaneous rhythmic bursting in 
some thalamocortical neurons (see Figure 10–15).
Voltage-Gated Potassium Channels
Voltage-dependent K+ channels comprise an especially 
varied group of channels that differ in their kinetics of 
activation, voltage-activation range, and sensitivity to 
various ligands. Mammalian neurons typically express 
members of at least five families of voltage-dependent 
K+ channels: Kv1, Kv2, Kv3, Kv4, and Kv7 (Figure 10–13). 
Each family consists of multiple gene products, with 
each channel composed of four α-subunits. For exam-
ple, there are eight closely-related genes encoding the 
members of the Kv1 gene family (Kv1.1–Kv1.8).
The subunits can be of the same type (a homomeric 
channel) or of different gene products from within the 
same Kv family (a heteromeric channel). For example, 
Kv1 channels can be formed by heteromeric combina-
tions of at least five different gene products that have 
wide expression in central neurons, with each combi-
nation possessing different properties of kinetics and 
voltage dependence. The possible functional variation 
provided by different combinations of α-subunits in 
heteromeric channels is immense, although not all pos-
sible combinations actually occur.
One way of distinguishing different components 
of voltage-dependent K+ currents in a neuron is by the 
presence or absence of inactivation. Non-inactivating 
K+ current, like that described in the squid axon by 
Hodgkin and Huxley, is called delayed rectifier K+ cur-
rent. In the squid axon, delayed rectifier current flows 
through a single Kv1 family channel type. In most 
mammalian neurons, delayed rectifier current includes 
multiple components from Kv1, Kv2, and Kv3 fam-
ily channels, each with different kinetics and voltage 
dependence. Kv3 channels are unusual in requiring 
large depolarizations to become activated and also in 
having very rapid kinetics of activation. As a result, 
Kv3 channels are not activated until the action poten-
tial is near its peak, but they activate quickly enough to 
help terminate the action potential.
In addition to delayed rectifier current, many neu-
rons also have a component of inactivating K+ current 
known as A-type current. In cell bodies and dendrites,

A-type current is formed primarily by Kv4 family 
α-subunits, which form channels that inactivate over a 
range of time scales from a few milliseconds to tens of 
milliseconds. Kv1 channels that include Kv1.4 subunits 
or the auxiliary subunit Kvβ1 also mediate an inactivat-
ing component of current, which is highly expressed in 
some nerve terminals as well as some cell bodies.
As is the case for Na+ channels and Cav3 family 
channels, A-type K+ current not only inactivates dur-
ing large depolarizations but is also subject to steady-
state inactivation by small depolarizations from rest, 
providing a mechanism by which its amplitude can be 
modulated by small voltage changes around resting 
potential (see Figure 10–15B).
Kv7 subunits form non-inactivating channels that 
require only small depolarizations from rest to be acti-
vated and can even be activated significantly at the 
resting potential. In some neurons, Kv7 channels are 
downregulated by the transmitter acetylcholine acting 
through muscarinic G protein–coupled receptors (thus 
the origin of an alternative name of “M-current”). Kv7 
channels typically activate relatively slowly, over tens 
of milliseconds, and provide little current during a sin-
gle action potential but tend to suppress firing of sub-
sequent action potentials (Chapter 14).
The KCNH gene family consists of three subfami-
lies of voltage-gated K+ channels (Kv10, Kv11, and

major classes of mammalian voltage-activated potassium 
channels.
A. Simplified generalization of the voltage dependence and 
kinetics of the major voltage-gated K+ families. Because Kv1, 
Kv4, and Kv7 channels can be activated by relatively small 
depolarizations, they often help control action potential (AP) 
threshold. Kv2 and Kv3 channels require larger depolariza-
tions to be activated. Kv1, Kv3, and Kv4 channels are activated 
relatively rapidly, whereas Kv7 and Kv2 channels are activated 
more slowly.
B. Simplified generalization of the differing activation times 
of the major components of delayed rectifier K+ channels 
during an action potential. Kv1 channels require small depo-
larizations and are activated rapidly, sometimes significantly 
in advance of the action potential. Kv3 channels require large 
depolarizations and are activated late in the rising phase of 
the action potential and deactivated very rapidly thereafter. 
Kv2 channels are activated relatively slowly during the fall-
ing phase of the action potential and remain open during the 
afterhyperpolarization. (Adapted, with permission, from

Voltage-Gated Hyperpolarization-Activated Cyclic 
Nucleotide-Gated Channels
Many neurons have cation channels that are slowly 
activated by hyperpolarization. This sensitivity to 
hyperpolarization is enhanced when intracellular 
cyclic nucleotides bind to the channel. Because these 
hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated 
(HCN) channels have only two of the four negative 
binding sites found in the selectivity filter of K+ chan-
nels, they are permeable to both K+ and Na+ and have 
a reversal potential around −40 to −30 mV. As a result, 
hyperpolarization from rest, as during strong synaptic 
inhibition or following an action potential, opens the 
channels to generate an inward depolarizing current 
referred to as Ih (see Figure 10–15D).
