membrane in a continuous array (Figure 26–3F). In the 
19th century, the German physiologist Hermann von 
Helmholtz was the first to appreciate that the basi-
lar membrane’s operation is essentially the inverse 
of a piano’s. The piano synthesizes a complex sound 
by combining the pure tones produced by numerous 
vibrating strings; the cochlea, by contrast, deconstructs 
a complex sound by isolating the component tones at 
the appropriate segments of the basilar membrane.
For any frequency within the auditory range, 
there is a characteristic place along the basilar mem-
brane at which the magnitude of vibration is maximal. 
Although the morphological gradients of the basilar 
membrane are key to the process, the actual disper-
sion of a sound’s frequency components along the 
cochlea’s longitudinal axis depends on the mechani-
cal properties of the cochlear partition as a whole. In 
particular, as we shall detail later, the hair cells within 
the organ of Corti provide active mechanical feed-
back that sharpens mechanical tuning of the basilar 
membrane and enhances its sensitivity to sound. The 
arrangement of vibration frequencies along the basilar 
membrane is an example of a tonotopic map. The rela-
tionship between frequency and position along the 
basilar membrane varies monotonically, but is not lin-
ear; the logarithm of the frequency decreases roughly 
in proportion to the distance from the cochlea’s base. 
The frequencies from 20 kHz to 2 kHz, those between 
2 kHz and 200 Hz, and those spanning 200 Hz to 20 Hz 
are each represented by approximately one-third of 
the basilar membrane’s extent.
Analysis of the response to a complex sound illus-
trates how the basilar membrane operates in daily life. 
A vowel sound in human speech, for example, ordinar-
ily comprises three dominant frequency components 
termed formants. Each frequency component of the 
stimulus establishes a traveling wave that, to a first 
approximation, is independent of the waves evoked by 
the others (Figure 26–3G) and reaches its peak excur-
sion at a point on the basilar membrane appropriate for 
that frequency component. The basilar membrane thus 
acts as a mechanical frequency analyzer by distribut-
ing the energies associated with the different frequency 
components of the stimulus to hair cells arrayed along 
its length. In doing so, the basilar membrane begins the 
encoding of the frequencies in a sound.
The Organ of Corti Is the Site of Mechanoelectrical 
Transduction in the Cochlea
The organ of Corti, a ridge of epithelium extending 
along the basilar membrane, is the receptor organ of the 
inner ear. Each organ of Corti contains approximately 
16,000 hair cells that are innervated by approximately 
30,000 afferent nerve fibers; these are fibers that carry 
information into the brain along the eighth cranial 
nerve. Like the basilar membrane itself, each hair cell 
is most sensitive to a particular frequency, and these 
frequencies are logarithmically mapped in descend-
ing order from the cochlea’s base to its apex. Thus, 
the information transmitted by these sensory cells 
to their innervating nerve fibers is also tonotopically 
organized.
The organ of Corti includes a variety of cells, some 
of unknown function, but four types have obvious 
importance. First, there are two types of hair cells. The 
inner hair cells form a single row of approximately 3,500 
cells, whereas approximately 12,000 outer hair cells lie 
in three rows farther from the central axis of the coch-
lear spiral (Figure 26–4). The space between the inner 
and outer hair cells is delimited and mechanically sup-
ported by pillar cells. The outer hair cells are supported 
at their bases by Deiters’s (phalangeal) cells.
A second epithelial ridge adjacent to the organ of 
Corti, but nearer the cochlea’s central axis, gives rise 
to the tectorial membrane, a gelatinous shelf that 
covers the organ of Corti (Figure 26–4). The tectorial 
membrane is anchored at its base, and its tapered 
distal edge forms a fragile connection with the organ 
of Corti.
Hair cells are not neurons; they lack both dendrites 
and axons (Figure 26–5A). A special saline solution, 
the endolymph that fills scala media, bathes the cell’s 
apical aspect. Tight junctions between hair cells and 
supporting cells separate this liquid from the stand-
ard extracellular fluid, or perilymph, that contacts 
the basolateral surface of the cell. Immediately below 
the tight junctions, a desmosomal junction provides 
a strong mechanical attachment for the hair cell to its 
neighbors.
The hair bundle, which serves as a receptive antenna 
for mechanical stimuli, projects from the flattened api-
cal surface of the hair cell. Each bundle comprises a few 
tens to a few hundred cylindrical processes, the stereo-
cilia, arranged in 2 to 10 parallel rows and extending 
several micrometers from the cell surface. Successive 
stereocilia across a cell’s surface vary monotonically in 
height; a hair bundle is beveled like the tip of a hypoder-
mic needle (Figure 26–5B). The inner hair-cell bundles 
of the mammalian cochlea, when viewed from above, 
have a roughly linear form. Outer hair-cell bundles, in 
contrast, have a V or W shape (Figure 26–6).
Each stereocilium is a rigid cylinder whose core 
consists of a fascicle of actin filaments that are heav-
ily cross-linked by the proteins plastin (fimbrin), fas-
cin, and epsin. Cross-linking renders a stereocilium

human organ of Corti. Although there are 
differences among species, the basic plan 
is similar for all mammals.
A. The organ of Corti, the inner ear’s 
receptor organ, is an epithelial strip that 
surmounts the elastic basilar membrane. 
The organ contains some 16,000 hair cells 
arrayed in four rows: a single row of inner 
hair cells and three rows of outer hair cells. 
The mechanically sensitive hair bundles of 
these receptor cells protrude into endo-
lymph, the liquid within the scala media. 
Reissner’s membrane, which provides the 
upper boundary of the scala media, sepa-
rates the endolymph from the perilymph 
in the scala vestibuli. The hair bundles of 
outer hair cells are attached at their tops 
to the lower surface of the tectorial mem-
brane, a gelatinous shelf that extends the 
full length of the basilar membrane.
B. The hair cells are separated and sup-
ported by pillar cells and Deiters’s cells. 
One hair cell has been removed from the 
middle row of outer hair cells to reveal the 
three-dimensional relationship between 
supporting cells and hair cells. Afferent and 
efferent nerve endings are colored in red 
and green, respectively.
much more rigid than would be expected for a bundle 
of unconnected actin filaments. The actin core of the 
stereocilium is covered by a tubular sheath of plasma 
membrane. Although a stereocilium is of constant 
diameter along most of its length, it tapers just above 
its basal insertion (see Figure 25–5B). Correspondingly, 
the number of actin filaments diminishes from sev-
eral hundred to only a few dozen. This thin cluster of 
microfilaments anchors the stereocilium in the cuticu-
lar plate, a thick mesh of interlinked actin filaments 
beneath the apical cell membrane. Because of this 
tapered structure, a mechanical force applied at the tip 
causes the stereocilium to pivot around its basal inser-
tion. Horizontal top connectors interconnect adjacent 
stereocilia near their tips. These extracellular filaments 
restrict the bundle to move as a unit during stimula-
tion at low frequencies. At high frequencies, the viscos-
ity of the liquid between the stereocilia also opposes 
their separation and thus ensures the unitary motion 
of the hair bundle.

A. The epithelial character of the hair cell is evident in this 
drawing of the sensory epithelium from a frog’s internal ear. 
The cylindrical hair cell is joined to adjacent supporting cells 
by a junctional complex around its apex. The hair bundle, a 
mechanically sensitive organelle, extends from the cell’s apical 
surface. The bundle comprises some 60 stereocilia arranged 
in stepped rows of varying length. At the bundle’s tall edge 
stands the single kinocilium, an axonemal structure with a 
bulbous swelling at its tip; in the mammalian cochlea, this 
organelle degenerates around the time of birth. Deflection of 
the hair bundle’s top to the right depolarizes the hair cell; move-
ment in the opposite direction elicits hyperpolarization. The hair 
cell is surrounded by supporting cells, whose apical surfaces 
bear a stubble of microvilli. Afferent and efferent synapses con-

During its early development, every hair bundle 
includes at its tall edge a single true cilium, the 
kinocilium (Figure 26–5). Like other cilia, this structure 
possesses at its core an axoneme, or array of nine paired 
microtubules, and often an additional central pair of 
microtubules. The kinocilium is not essential for mecha-
noelectrical transduction, for in mammalian cochlear hair 
cells, it degenerates around the time of birth.
Hair Cells Transform Mechanical Energy Into 
Neural Signals
Deflection of the Hair Bundle Initiates 
Mechanoelectrical Transduction
Just as in vestibular organs (Chapter 27), mechani-
cal deflection of the hair bundle is the stimulus that 
excites hair cells of the cochlea. Stimuli elicit an elec-
trical response, the receptor potential, by opening or 
closing—a process termed “gating”—mechanically 
sensitive ion channels. The hair cell’s response depends 
on the direction and magnitude of the stimulus.
In an unstimulated cell, 10% to 50% of the chan-
nels involved in stimulus transduction are open. As a 
result, the cell’s resting potential, which lies within a 
range of approximately –70 to –30 mV, is determined in 
part by the influx of cations through these channels. A 
stimulus that displaces the bundle toward its tall edge 
opens additional channels, thereby depolarizing the 
cell (Figure 26–7). In contrast, a stimulus that displaces 
the bundle toward its short edge shuts transduction 
channels that are open at rest, thus hyperpolarizing

A. A recording electrode is inserted into a frog hair cell.
B. A probe attached to the bulbous tip of the stereocilium is

erally only one-tenth as large as those portrayed.
C. When the top of a hair bundle is displaced back and forth 
(upper trace), the opening and closing of mechanically sensi-
tive ion channels produce an oscillatory receptor potential 
(lower trace) that—as here—may saturate in both the depolar-
izing and the hyperpolarizing directions.
D. The relation between hair-bundle deflection (abscissa) and 
receptor potential (ordinate) is sigmoidal. The entire operating 
range is only approximately 100 nm, less than the diameter 
of an individual stereocilium. At rest, the hair bundle operates 
within the steep region of the sigmoid, which ensures signifi-
cant receptor potentials in response to weak stimuli.

the cell. Hair cells respond most to stimuli parallel to 
the hair bundle’s axis of morphological mirror sym-
metry: Stimuli at right angles to the axis produce little 
change from the resting potential. An oblique stimulus 
elicits a response proportional to its vectorial projec-
tion along the axis of sensitivity.
A hair cell’s receptor potential is graded. As the 
stimulus amplitude increases, the receptor potential 
grows progressively larger up to the point of satura-
tion. The receptor potential of an inner hair cell can be 
as great as 25 mV in peak-to-peak magnitude. The rela-
tion between a bundle’s deflection and the resulting 
electrical response is sigmoidal (Figure 26–7D). A dis-
placement of only ±100 nm represents approximately 
90% of the response range. During normal stimulation, 
a hair bundle moves through an angle of ±1° or so, that 
is, by much less than the diameter of one stereocilium.
When observed in vitro, a hair bundle exhibits 
Brownian motion of approximately ±3 nm, whereas 
the threshold of hearing corresponds to basilar-
membrane movements of as little as ±0.3 nm. There 
are at least three mechanisms that explain how the 
hair bundle may respond to motion smaller than its 
own noise. First, because the cochlear partition does 
not move as a rigid body, the movement of the hair 
bundle is larger than that of the basilar membrane. 
Second, frequency-selective amplification of low stim-
uli actively pulls the signal out of the noise. Finally, 
mechanical coupling to a group of neighbors results in 
synchronization that effectively reduces noise. At hear-
ing threshold, a stimulus evokes a receptor potential 
near 100 μV in amplitude.
The ion channels in hair cells that mediate mecha-
noelectrical transduction are relatively nonselective, 
cation-passing pores with a conductance near 100 pS. 
From the known size of small organic cations and 
fluorescent molecules that can traverse the channel, 
the transduction channel’s pore must be about 1.3 nm 
in diameter. Most of the transduction current is car-
ried by K+, the cation with the highest concentration 
in the endolymph bathing the hair bundle. Although 


===== Page 6 =====
Chapter 26 / Auditory Processing by the Cochlea    609
endolymph is relatively poor in Ca2+, a small fraction 
of the transduction current is carried by this ion. Flu-
orescent indicators indicate that Ca2+ entry, and thus 
mechanoelectrical transduction, occurs precisely at 
the stereociliary tips of a deflected hair bundle. Single-
channel recordings, together with the observation that 
the magnitude of the transduction current is roughly 
proportional to the number of functional stereocilia 
remaining in a microdissected bundle, indicate that 
there are probably only two active transduction chan-
nels per stereocilium.
The large diameter and poor selectivity of the 
pore permit transduction channels to be blocked by 
aminoglycoside antibiotics such as streptomycin, gen-
tamicin, and tobramycin. When used in large doses to 
counter bacterial infections, these drugs have a toxic 
effect on hair cells; the antibiotics damage hair bun-
dles and eventually kill hair cells. These drugs pass 
through transduction channels at a low rate and thus 
cause long-term toxic effects by interfering with pro-
tein synthesis on the mitochondrial ribosomes, which 
resemble bacterial ribosomes. Consistent with this 
hypothesis, human sensitivity to aminoglycosides is 
maternally inherited, as are the mitochondria, and in 
many instances reflects a single base change in the 12S 
ribosomal RNA gene of the mitochondrion.
Mechanical Force Directly Opens  
Transduction Channels
The mechanism for gating of transduction channels in 
hair cells differs fundamentally from the mechanisms 
used for electrical signals in neurons such as the action 
potential or postsynaptic potential. Many ion channels 
respond to changes in membrane potential or to spe-
cific ligands (Chapters 8, 10, and 12–14). In contrast, 
two lines of evidence suggest that the mechanoelectri-
cal transduction channels in the hair cell are activated 
by mechanical strain.
First, a bundle is stiffer along its axis of mechani-
cal sensitivity than at a right angle. This observation 
suggests that a portion of the work done in deflecting a 
bundle goes into elastic elements, termed gating springs, 
which pull on the molecular gates of the transduction 
channels. Because the gating springs contribute over 
half of a hair bundle’s stiffness, the transduction chan-
nels efficiently capture the energy supplied when a 
bundle is deflected. In addition, the mechanical prop-
erties of a hair bundle vary during channel gating: 
When channels open or close, stiffness decreases and 
friction increases. Both phenomena are expected if the 
channels are gated directly through a mechanical link-
age to the hair bundle.
A second indication that transduction channels 
are directly controlled by gating springs is the rapidity 
with which hair cells respond. The response latency is 
so brief, only a few microseconds, that gating is more 
likely to be direct than to involve a second messenger 
(Chapter 14). Moreover, the electrical responses of hair 
cells to a series of step stimuli of increasing magnitude 
become both larger and faster. This behavior favors a 
kinetic scheme in which mechanical force controls the 
rate constant for channel gating.
The tip link is a probable component of the gating 
spring. A tip link is a fine molecular braid joining the 
distal end of one stereocilium to the side of the long-
est adjacent process (Figure 26–8A). Deflection of a 
hair bundle toward its tall edge tenses the tip link and 
promotes channel opening; movement in the opposite 
direction slackens the link and allows the associated 
channels to close (Figure 26–8B).
Three experimental results suggest that the tip links 
are components of the gating springs. First, tip links are  
universal features of hair bundles and are situated at 
the site of transduction. The transduction channels 
are indeed located at the stereociliary tips, thus near 
the lower insertion point of the tip link. Second, the 
orientation of the links is consistent with the vectorial 
sensitivity of transduction. The links invariably inter-
connect stereocilia in a direction parallel with the hair 
bundle’s axis of mechanosensitivity. Finally, when tip 
links are disrupted by exposing hair cells to Ca2+ chela-
tors, transduction vanishes. As the tip links regenerate 
over the course of approximately 12 hours, a hair cell 
regains mechanosensitivity. It remains unclear whether 
the elasticity of gating springs resides primarily in the 
tip links or in the structures at their two insertions.
In the mammalian cochlea, hair bundles are 
deflected through their linkage to the tectorial mem-
brane. When the basilar membrane oscillates up 
and down in response to a sound, the organ of Corti 
and the overlying tectorial membrane move with it. 
Because the basilar and tectorial membranes pivot 
about different lines of insertion, however, their up-
and-down motion is accompanied by a back-and-
forth shearing motion between the upper surface of 
the organ of Corti and the lower surface of the tecto-
rial membrane. This is the motion that is detected by 
hair cells (Figure 26–9).
The hair bundles of outer hair cells, whose tips are 
firmly attached to the tectorial membrane, are directly 
deflected by this movement. The hair bundles of inner 
hair cells, which do not contact the tectorial membrane, 
are deflected by movement of the liquid beneath the 
membrane. This mode of stimulation affords some 
mechanical magnification of the signals reaching hair

gate. The enhanced tension promotes 
channel opening and the influx of cations,

bundles. At least for high-frequency stimuli, the move-
ments of hair bundles are thought to be severalfold 
greater than that of the basilar membrane.
Direct Mechanoelectrical Transduction Is Rapid
Hair cells operate much more quickly than do other 
sensory receptor cells of the vertebrate nervous system 
and, indeed, more quickly than neurons themselves. 
To deal with the frequencies of biologically relevant 
sounds, transduction by hair cells must be rapid. 
Given the behavior of sound in air and the dimen-
sions of sound-emitting and sound-absorbing organs 
such as vocal cords and eardrums, optimal audi-
tory communication occurs in the frequency range of  
10 Hz to 100 kHz. Much higher frequencies propagate

in the cochlea are stimulated when the basilar membrane is

hair cells, which are attached to the lower surface of the tecto-
rial membrane. The hair bundles of inner hair cells, which are

poorly through air; much lower frequencies are inef-
ficiently produced and poorly captured by animals of 
moderate size. Even in animals sensitive to relatively 
low frequencies, such as frogs, the in vitro transduc-
tion current in response to a step stimulus of moder-
ate intensity rises with a time constant of only 80 μs 
at room temperature. For mammals to be able to 
respond to frequencies greater than 100 kHz, the hair 
cells evidently display gating times that are an order 
of magnitude smaller. Locating sound sources, one 
of the most important functions of hearing, sets even 
more stringent limits on the speed of transduction  
(Chapter 28). A sound from a source directly to one 
side of a person reaches the nearer ear somewhat 
sooner than the farther, by at most 700 μs in humans. 
An observer can locate sound sources on the basis of 
much smaller delays, about 10 μs. For this to occur, 
hair cells must be capable of transducing acoustic 
waveforms with microsecond-level resolution.
Deafness Genes Provide Components of the 
Mechanotransduction Machinery
Genetic studies of deafness in both humans and mouse 
models have provided entry points into the molecular 
composition of the mechanotransduction machinery of 
the hair cell. In particular, the upper two-thirds of the 
tip link consist of two parallel molecules of cadherin-23, 
whereas the lower third comprises two parallel mol-
ecules of protocadherin-15 (Figure 26–10). The two 
components are joined at their tips in a Ca2+-sensitive 
manner; lowering the extracellular Ca2+ concentration 
below approximately 1 μM disrupts their association. 
In humans, mutations in the genes coding for cadherin 
23 (USH1D) and protocadherin 15 (USH1F) lead to the 
most severe form of the Usher syndrome, an autosomal 
recessive disorder that associates severe-to-profound 
congenital deafness, constant vestibular dysfunction, 
and retinitis pigmentosa with a prepubertal onset. The 
study of other genes involved in this type of Usher 
syndrome has revealed that the upper end of the tip 
link is anchored to the actin core of a stereocilium by a 
protein complex that includes the scaffolding proteins 
sans (USH1G) and harmonin (USH1C), as well as the 
molecular motor myosin 7a (USH1B).
The small number of channels in a hair cell, along 
with the lack of high-affinity ligands with which to 
label them, explains why the biochemical identity of 
the transduction channels has long remained uncertain. 
However, recent genetic, biochemical, and biophysical 
experiments indicate that four integral transmembrane 
proteins are intimately related to the transduction 
channel: transmembrane channel-like proteins 1 and

A. The tip link is composed of the heterophilic association of 
protocadherin 15 and cadherin 23. Two transduction channels 
are localized near the lower insertion point of the tip link at 
the tip of the shorter stereocilium. Each channel is part of a 
molecular complex that includes the proteins TMC1/2, LHFPL5, 
and TMIE. At the upper insertion point on the flank of the 
longer stereocilium, cadherin 23 interacts with harmonin b and 
the molecular motor myosin 7a, which both bind to actin and 
thus anchor the tip link. The protein sans serves as a scaffolding 
protein. In vestibular hair cells, myosin 1c may set the tip link 
under tension, but the presence of this motor protein is uncer-
tain in cochlear hair cells.

arrangement of these proteins within the transduction apparatus 
is still unknown. Unlike what the figure suggests, TMC1 has been 
proposed to assemble as a dimer, with each TMC1 molecule  
contributing a permeation pathway for cations. (Adapted, with

2 (TMC1 and TMC2), tetraspan membrane protein 
in hair-cell stereocilia (TMHS; official nomenclature

gene (TMIE; Figure 26–10). Mechanotransduction 
is abolished in mouse hair cells lacking TMIE, even 
though all other known components of the trans-
duction machinery appear to be properly in place. 
However, because TMIE contains only two pre-
dicted transmembrane domains, it seems highly 
unlikely that this protein alone constitutes an ion 
channel. In the absence of LHFPL5, the conductance 
of the transduction channel is reduced, but signifi-
cant transduction currents can still be measured, 
suggesting that this protein is not an essential part 
of the channel pore.
Multiple lines of evidence advocate for TMC1 and 
TMC2 as components of the transduction channel. 
Both proteins are localized near the lower insertion 
point of the tip link, where the transduction current 
enters the hair cell, interact with the tip-link constit-
uent protocadherin 15, and their onset of expression 
coincides with that of mechanoelectrical transduction. 
In addition, transduction channels in a mouse carrying 
a single point mutation in the Tmc1 gene show lower 
conductance and Ca2+ permeability, indicating that 
TMC1 is very close to the channel’s pore. Individual
