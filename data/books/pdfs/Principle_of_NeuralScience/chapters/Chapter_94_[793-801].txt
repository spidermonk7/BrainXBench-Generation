Figure 31–9  (Opposite) The sarcomere is the basic  
functional unit of muscle. (Adapted from Bloom and  
Fawcett 1975.)
A. This section of a muscle fiber shows its anatomical organi-
zation. Several myofibrils lie side by side in a fiber, and each 
myofibril is made up of sarcomeres arranged end to end and 
separated by Z disks (see part B). The myofibrils are surrounded 
by an activation system (the transverse tubules, terminal 
cisternae, and sarcoplasmic reticulum) that initiates muscle 
contraction.
B. Sarcomeres are connected to one another and to the muscle 
fiber membrane by the cytoskeletal lattice. The cytoskeleton 
influences the length of the contractile elements, the thick and 
thin filaments (see part C). It maintains the alignment of these 
filaments within a sarcomere, connects adjacent myofibrils, 
and transmits force to the extracellular matrix of connective 
tissue through costameres. One consequence of this organiza-
tion is that the force generated by the contractile elements in 
a sarcomere can be transmitted along and across sarcomeres 
(through desmin and skelemin), within and between sarcom-
eres (through nebulin and titin), and to the sarcolemma through 
the costameres. The Z disk is a focal point for many of these 
connections.
C. The thick and thin filaments comprise different contractile 
proteins. The thin filament includes polymerized actin along 
with the regulatory proteins tropomyosin and troponin. The 
thick filament is an array of myosin molecules; each molecule 
includes a stem that terminates in a pair of globular heads.  
The protein titin maintains the position of each thick filament in 
the middle of the sarcomere.
of the potential cross bridges are formed. This explains 
why the peak force of a twitch is less than the maxi-
mal force of the muscle fiber (see Figure 31–2A). Maxi-
mal force can be achieved only with a series of action 
potentials that sustains the Ca2+ concentration in the 
sarcoplasm, thus maximizing cross bridge formation.
Although Ca2+ activates formation of the cross 
bridges, cross bridges can be formed only when the 
thick and thin filaments overlap. This overlap varies 
as the filaments slide relative to one another (Figure 
31–11A). The amount of overlap between actin and 
myosin is optimal at an intermediate sarcomere length 
(Lo), and the relative force is maximal. Increases in sar-
comere length reduce the overlap between actin and 
myosin and the force that can be developed. Decreases 
in sarcomere length cause the thin filaments to overlap, 
reducing the number of binding sites available to the 
myosin heads. Although many muscles operate over 
a narrow range of sarcomere lengths (approximately  
94 ± 13% Lo, mean ± standard deviation), among 
muscles, there is considerable diversity in sarcomere 
lengths during movement.
Because structures that connect the contractile pro-
teins to the skeleton also influence the force that a mus-
cle can exert, muscle force increases with length over its 
operating range. This property enables muscle to function 
like a spring and to resist changes in length. Muscle 
stiffness, which corresponds to the slope of the rela-
tion between muscle force and muscle length (N/m), 
depends on the structure of the muscle. A stiffer mus-
cle, similar to a stronger spring, is more resistant to 
changes in length.
Once activated, cross bridges perform work and 
cause the thick and thin filaments to slide relative to one 
another. Due to the elasticity of intracellular cytoskel-
etal proteins and the extracellular matrix, sarcomeres 
will shorten when the cross bridges are activated and 
the length of the muscle fiber is held fixed (isometric 
contraction). When the length of the muscle fiber is not 
kept constant, the direction and rate of change in sar-
comere length depend on the amount of muscle fiber 
force relative to the magnitude of the load against 
which the fiber acts. Sarcomere length decreases when 
the muscle fiber force exceeds the load (shortening con-
traction) but increases when the force is less than the 
load (lengthening contraction). The maximal force that 
a muscle fiber can exert decreases as shortening veloc-
ity increases but increases as lengthening velocity 
increases (Figure 31–11B).
The maximal rate at which a muscle fiber can 
shorten is limited by the peak rate at which cross 
bridges can form. The variation in fiber force as con-
traction velocity changes is largely caused by differ-
ences in the average force exerted by each cross bridge. 
For example, the decrease in force during a shorten-
ing contraction is attributable to a reduction in cross-
bridge displacement during each power stroke and the 
failure of some myosin heads to find attachment sites. 
Conversely, the increase in force during a lengthen-
ing contraction reflects the stretching of incompletely 
activated sarcomeres, the more rapid reattachment of 
cross bridges after they have been pulled apart, and 
the attachment of Ca2+ to titin.
The rate of cross-bridge cycling depends not only on 
contraction velocity but also on the preceding activity of 
the muscle. For example, the rate of cross-bridge cycling 
increases after a brief isometric contraction. When a 
muscle is stretched while in this state, such as would 
occur during a postural disturbance, muscle stiffness 
is enhanced, and the muscle is more effective at resist-
ing the change in length. This property is known as 
short-range stiffness. Conversely, the cross-bridge cycling 
rate decreases after shortening contractions, and the 
muscle does not exhibit short-range stiffness.

Figure 31–10  The cross-bridge cycle. Several nonactivating 
states are followed by several activating states triggered by 
Ca2+. The cycle begins at the top (step 1) with the binding of 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the myosin head. The myosin 
head detaches from actin (step 2), ATP is cleaved to phosphate 
(Pi) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (step 3), and the myosin 
becomes weakly bound to actin (step 4). The binding of Ca2+ to 
troponin causes tropomyosin to slide over actin and enables the 
two myosin heads to close (step 5). This results in the release 
of Pi and the extension of the myosin neck, the power stroke of 
the cross-bridge cycle (step 6). Each cross-bridge exerts a force 
of approximately 2 pN during a structural change (step 7) and 
the release of ADP (step 8). (•, strong binding; ∼, weak binding;

Muscle Torque Depends on  
Musculoskeletal Geometry
The anatomy of a muscle has a pronounced effect on 
its force capacity, range of motion, and shortening 
velocity. The anatomical features that influence func-
tion include the arrangement of the sarcomeres in 
each muscle fiber, the organization of the muscle fib-
ers within the muscle, and the location of the mus-
cle’s attachments on the skeleton. These features vary 
widely among muscles.
At the level of a single muscle fiber, the number 
of sarcomeres in series and in parallel can vary. The 
number of sarcomeres in series determines the length

Chapter 31 / The Motor Unit and Muscle Action    751
Figure 31–11  Contractile force varies with the change in 
sarcomere length and velocity.
A. At an intermediate sarcomere length, Lo, the amount of 
overlap between actin and myosin is optimal and the relative 
force is maximal. When the sarcomere is stretched beyond the 
length at which the thick and thin filaments overlap (length a),  
cross bridges cannot form and no force is exerted. As sar-
comere length decreases and the overlap of the thick and 
thin filaments increases (between lengths a and b), the force 
increases because the number of cross bridges increases. With 
further reductions in length (between lengths c and e), the 
extreme overlap of the thin filaments with each other occludes 
potential attachment sites and the force decreases.
B. Contractile force varies with the rate of change in sarcomere 
length. Relative to the force that a sarcomere can exert during 
an isometric contraction (zero velocity), the peak force declines 
as the rate of shortening increases. Muscle force reaches a 
minimum at the maximal shortening velocity (Vmax). In contrast, 
when the sarcomere is lengthened while being activated, the 
peak force increases to values greater than those during an 
isometric contraction. Shortening causes the myosin heads to 
spend more time near the end of their power stroke, where 
they produce less contractile force, and more time detaching, 
recocking, and reattaching, during which they produce no force. 
When the muscle is actively lengthened, the myosin heads 
spend more time stretched beyond their angle of attachment 
and little time unattached because they do not need to be 
recocked after being pulled away from the actin in this manner. 
Titin also contributes significantly to sarcomere force during 
lengthening contractions.

Figure 31–12  Five common 
arrangements of tendon and 
muscle. The fundamental distinc-
tion between these arrangements 
is whether or not the muscle fas-
cicles are aligned with the line of 
pull of the muscles. The fascicles 
in muscles A and B are parallel to 
the line of pull (longitudinal axis 
of the muscle), whereas the fas-
cicles in muscles C, D, and E are 
rotated away from the line of pull. 
The magnitude of this rotation is 
expressed as the pennation angle.

Alexander and Ker 1990.)
of the myofibril and thus the length of the muscle fiber. 
Because one sarcomere can shorten by a certain length 
with a given maximal velocity, both the range of motion 
and the maximal shortening velocity of a muscle fiber 
are proportional to the number of sarcomeres in series. 
The force that a myofibril can exert is equal to the aver-
age sarcomere force and is not influenced by the num-
ber of sarcomeres in series. Rather, the force capacity of 
a fiber depends on the number of sarcomeres in paral-
lel and hence on the diameter or cross-sectional area 
of the fiber. At the level of the muscle, the functional 
attributes of the fibers are modified by the orientation 
of the fascicles (bundles of muscle fibers) to the line of 
pull of the muscle and the length of the fiber relative 
to the muscle length. In most muscles, the fascicles are 
not parallel to the line of pull but fan out in feather-like 
(pennate) arrangements (Figure 31–12).
The relative orientation, or pennation angle of the 
fascicles, ranges from close to 0° (biceps brachii, sarto-
rius) to approximately 30° (soleus). Because more fib-
ers can fit into a given volume as the pennation angle 
increases, muscles with large pennation angles typi-
cally have more fascicles in parallel and hence large 
cross-sectional areas when measured perpendicular 
to the long axis of individual muscle fibers. Given the 
linear relation between cross-sectional area (quantity

of contractile proteins in parallel) and maximal force 
(∼22.5 N • cm–2), these muscles are capable of a greater 
maximal force. However, the fibers in pennate muscles 
are generally short and have a lesser maximal shorten-
ing velocity than those in nonpennate muscles.
The functional consequences of this anatomical 
arrangement can be seen by comparing the contractile 
properties of two muscles with different numbers of 
fibers and fiber lengths. If the two muscles have iden-
tical fiber lengths but one has twice as many fibers, 
the range of motion of the two muscles will be similar 
because it is a function of fiber length, but the maxi-
mal force capacity will vary in proportion to the num-
ber of muscle fibers. If the two muscles have identical 
numbers of fibers but the fibers in one muscle are twice 
as long, the muscle with the longer fibers will have a 
greater range of motion and a greater maximal short-
ening velocity, even though the two muscles have a 
similar force capacity. Because of this effect, the muscle 
with longer fibers is able to exert more force and pro-
duce more power (the product of force and velocity) 
at a given absolute shortening velocity (Figure 31–13).
Muscle fiber lengths and cross-sectional areas 
vary substantially throughout the human body, which 
suggests that the contractile properties of individual 
muscles also differ markedly (Table 31–2). In the leg,

Figure 31–14  Muscle torque varies over the range of 
motion about a joint. A muscle’s torque about a joint is the 
product of its contractile force (F) and its moment arm relative 
to the joint (d). The moment arm is the shortest perpendicular 
distance from the line of pull of the muscle to the center of 
rotation of the joint. Because the moment arm changes when 
the joint rotates, muscle torque varies with angular displace-
ment about the joint. The net torque about a joint, which deter-
mines the mechanical action, is the difference in the torques 
exerted by opposing muscles, such as extensors (ext) and flex-
ors (flex). Similarly, a force applied to the limb (Fload) will exert 
a torque about the joint that depends on Fload and its distance 
from the joint (dseg).
for example, pennation angle ranges from 1° (sarto-
rius) to 30° (vastus medialis), fiber length ranges from 
4 mm (soleus) to 40 mm (sartorius), and cross-sectional 
area ranges from 2 cm2 (sartorius) to 52 cm2 (soleus). 
In addition, the fact that muscle fiber length is usually 
less than muscle length indicates that muscle fibers are 
connected serially within a muscle. Functionally cou-
pled muscles tend to have complementary combina-
tions of these properties. For example, the three vasti 
muscles have similar muscle fiber lengths (10 cm), 
but they differ in pennation angle (intermedius is the 
smallest) and cross-sectional area (lateralis is the larg-
est). A similar relation exists for soleus and the two 
heads (medial and lateral) of gastrocnemius.
Movement involves the muscle-controlled rota-
tion of adjacent body segments, which means that 
the capacity of a muscle to contribute to a movement 
also depends on its location relative to the joint that 
it spans. The rotary force exerted by a muscle about a 
joint is referred to as muscle torque and is calculated as 
the product of the muscle force and the moment arm, 
the shortest perpendicular distance from the line of 
pull of the muscle to the joint’s center (Figure 31–14).
The moment arm usually changes as a joint rotates 
through its range of motion; the amount of change 
depends on where the muscle is attached to the skeleton

relative to the joint. If the force exerted by a muscle 
remains relatively constant throughout the joint’s range 
of motion, muscle torque varies in direct proportion to 
the change in the moment arm. For many muscles, the 
moment arm is maximal in the middle of the range of 
motion, which usually corresponds to the position of 
maximal muscle force and hence greatest muscle torque.
Different Movements Require Different 
Activation Strategies
The human body has approximately 600 muscles, each 
with a distinct torque profile about one or more joints. 
To perform a desired movement, the nervous system 
must activate an appropriate combination of muscles 
with adequate intensity and timing of activity. The 
activation must be appropriate for the contractile prop-
erties and musculoskeletal geometry of many muscles, 
as well as the mechanical interactions between body 
segments. As a result of these demands, activation 
strategies differ with the details of the movement.
Contraction Velocity Can Vary in Magnitude  
and Direction
Movement speed depends on the contraction velocity 
of a muscle. The only ways to vary contraction velocity 
are to alter either the number of motor units recruited or 
the rates at which they discharge action potentials. The 
velocity of a contraction can vary in both magnitude 
and direction (see Figure 31–11B). To control the veloc-
ity of a contraction, the nervous system must scale the 
magnitude of the net muscle torque relative to the load 
torque (Figure 31–14), which includes both the weight of 
the body part and any external load acting on the body.
When muscle torque exceeds load torque, the muscle 
shortens as it performs a shortening contraction. When 
muscle torque is less than load torque, the muscle length-
ens as it performs a lengthening contraction. For the 
example shown in Figure 31–14, the load is lifted with a 
shortening contraction of the flexor and lowered with a 
lengthening contraction of the flexor. Both types of con-
tractions are common in daily activities.
Shortening and lengthening contractions are not 
simply the result of adjusting motor unit activity so 
that the net muscle torque is greater or less than the 
load torque. When the task involves lifting a load with 
a prescribed trajectory, activation of the motor units 
must be aligned so that the sum of the rise times pro-
duce the appropriate torque so as to match the desired 
trajectory while lifting (shortening contractions), 
whereas while lowering the load (lengthening con-
tractions), the sum of the decay times must be similarly

controlled. The nervous system accomplishes this with 
different descending input and sensory feedback dur-
ing the two types of contractions. Because of these dif-
ferences in required motor unit activity, the control of the 
two types of contraction respond differently to stresses 
imposed on the system. Declines in the capacity to con-
trol motor unit activity, such as observed in older adults 
and persons performing rehabilitation exercises after an 
orthopedic procedure, are associated with greater diffi-
culty in performing lengthening contractions.
The amount of motor unit activity relative to the 
load also influences the contraction velocity. This effect

A. According to Newton’s law of acceleration (force = mass × 
acceleration), force is required to change the velocity of a mass. 
Muscles exert a torque to accelerate the inertial mass of the skel-
etal segment around a joint. For angular motion, Newton’s law is 
written as torque = rotational inertia × angular acceleration.
B. The angular velocity for movement of a limb from one position 
to another has a bell-shaped profile. Acceleration in one direction is 
followed by acceleration in the opposite direction—the flexor and 
extensor muscles are activated in succession. The records here 
show the activation profiles and associated muscle torques for a 
fast elbow flexion movement. Because contractile force decays 
relatively slowly, the flexor muscle is usually activated a second 
time to counter the prolonged acceleration generated by the exten-
sor muscle and to stop the limb at the intended joint angle.
depends on both the number of motor units recruited 
and the maximal rates at which the motor units can 
discharge action potentials. As described previously, 
physical training with rapid contractions, such as 
power training, increases the rate at which motor units 
can discharge trains of action potentials, which can be 
mimicked by step injections of current into a motor 
neuron. Changes in the maximal shortening veloc-
ity of a muscle after a change in the habitual level of 
physical activity are the result, at least partly, of factors 
that influence the ability of motor neurons to discharge 
action potentials at high rates.
Movements Involve the Coordination  
of Many Muscles
In the simplest case, muscles span a single joint and cause 
the attached body segments to accelerate about a single 
axis of rotation. Because muscles can exert only a pulling 
force, motion about a single axis of rotation requires at 
least two muscles or groups of muscles when the action 
involves shortening contractions (Figure 31–15A).
Because most muscles attach to the skeleton 
slightly off center from the axis of rotation, they can 
cause movement about more than one axis of rotation. 
If one of the actions is not required, the nervous system 
must activate other muscles to control the unwanted 
movement. For example, activation of the radial flexor 
muscle of the wrist can cause the wrist to flex and 
abduct. If the intended action is only wrist flexion, 
then the abduction action must be opposed by another 
muscle, such as the ulnar flexor muscle, which causes 
wrist flexion and adduction. Depending on the geom-
etry of the articulating surfaces and the attachment 
sites of the muscles, the multiple muscles that span a 
joint are capable of producing movements about one 
to three axes of rotation. Furthermore, some structures

Figure 31–16  A single muscle can 
influence the motion about many 
joints.
A. Muscles that cross one joint can 
accelerate an adjacent body seg-
ment. For example, at the beginning 
of the swing phase while running, 
the hip flexor muscles are activated 
to accelerate the thigh forward (red 
arrow). This action causes the lower 
leg to rotate backward (blue arrow) 
and the knee joint to flex. To control 
the knee joint flexion during the first 
part of the swing phase, the knee 
extensor muscles are activated and 
undergo a lengthening contraction to 
accelerate the lower leg forward (red 
arrow) while it continues to rotate 
backward (blue arrow).
B. Many muscles cross more than 
one joint to exert an effect on more 
than one body segment. For example, 
the hamstring muscles of the leg 
accelerate the hip in the direction of 
extension and the knee in the direc-
tion of flexion (red arrows). During 
running, at the end of the swing 
phase, the hamstring muscles are 
activated and undergo lengthening 
contractions to control the forward 
rotation of the leg (hip flexion and 
knee extension). This strategy is more 
economical than activating individual 
muscles at the hip and knee joints to 
control the forward rotation of the leg.
can be displaced linearly (eg, the scapula on the trunk), 
adding to the degrees of freedom about a joint.
The off-axis attachment of muscles enhances the 
flexibility of the skeletal motor system; the same move-
ment can be achieved by activating different combina-
tions of muscles. However, this additional flexibility 
requires the nervous system to control the unwanted 
actions. A solution used by the nervous system is to 
organize relations among selected muscles to produce 
specific actions. A particular sequence of muscle acti-
vations is known as a muscle synergy, and movement is 
produced through the coordinated activation of these 
synergies. For example, EMG recordings of human 
subjects suggest that variations of movements with the 
same general purpose, such as grasping various objects 
with the hand, reaching and pointing in different direc-
tions, or walking and running at several speeds, are con-
trolled by approximately five muscle synergies.
The number of muscles that participate in a move-
ment also varies with the speed of the movement. For 
example, slow lifting of a load requires only that the 
muscle torque slightly exceed the load torque (see Figure 
31–14), and thus, only the flexor muscle is activated. This 
strategy is used when lifting a handheld weight with the 
elbow flexor muscles. In contrast, to perform this move-
ment rapidly with an abrupt termination at an intended 
joint angle, both the flexor and extensor muscles must be 
activated. First, the flexor muscle is activated to acceler-
ate the limb in the direction of flexion, followed by acti-
vation of the extensor muscle to accelerate the limb in 
the direction of extension, and finally a burst of activity 
by the flexor muscle to increase the angular momentum 
of the limb and the handheld weight in the direction 
of flexion so that it arrives at the desired joint angle  
(Figure 31–15B). The amount of extensor muscle activity 
increases with the speed of the movement.
Increases in movement speed introduce another 
factor that the nervous system must control: unwanted 
accelerations in other body segments. Because body 
parts are connected to one another, motion in one part 
can induce motion in another. The induced motion is 
often controlled with lengthening contractions, such as
