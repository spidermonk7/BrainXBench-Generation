Figure 29–16  (Right) Expression of T1R and T2R receptors 
on the tongue. Sections of mouse or rat tongue were hybrid-
ized to probes that label T1R or T2R mRNAs to detect their 
sites of expression in taste cells.
A. The T1R3 receptor is expressed in taste cells of all three 
types of papillae. However, T1R1 is found mostly in fungiform 
papillae, whereas T1R2 is located predominantly in circumval-
late (and foliate) papillae. Overlap between sites of expression 
appears as yellow cells in the micrographs at the top. The T1R1-
T1R3 umami receptor is more frequently found in fungiform 
papillae, whereas the T1R2-T1R3 sweet receptor is more fre-
quently found in circumvallate and foliate papillae. (Reproduced,

B. A taste cell that detects bitter tastants can express several 
variants of T2R receptors. Here, probes for T2R3 and T2R7 
labeled the same taste cells in circumvallate papillae. (Repro-
duced, with permission, from Adler et al. 2000.)
C. The T1R and T2R receptors are expressed in different taste 
cells. Taste cells labeled by a T1R3 probe or mixed T1R probes 
(green) did not overlap with cells labeled by a mixture of T2R 
probes (red). (Reproduced, with permission, from Nelson et al.

complex can interact with all l-amino acids (Figure 
29–15B), but in humans it is preferentially activated 
by glutamate. Purine nucleotides, such as inosine 
5′-monophosphate (IMP), are often added to mono-
sodium glutamate to enhance its pleasurable umami 
taste. Interestingly, in vitro studies demonstrated that 
IMP potentiates the responsiveness of T1R1/T1R3 to 
l-amino acids, acting as a strong positive allosteric 
modulator of the receptor (Figure 29–15B).
Taste cells with both T1R1 and T1R3 are concen-
trated in fungiform papillae (Figure 29–16A). Studies 
in genetically engineered mice in which individual 
T1R genes have been deleted indicate that the T1R1/
T1R3 complex is solely responsible for umami taste, 
whereas T1R2/T1R3 is solely responsible for sweet 
taste. As expected, a genetic knockout of T1R1 selec-
tively abolishes umami taste, a knockout of T1R2 spe-
cifically abolishes sweet taste, while a knockout of 
T1R3 eliminates both sweet and umami taste (exactly 
as predicted, given that it is a common subunit of both 
the umami and sweet taste receptors).
Sweet and umami receptors differ significantly 
among different species. Most interestingly, different 
T1R subunits have been lost in some species, likely 
reflecting their evolutionary niche and diet. For exam-
ple, the giant panda, which feeds almost exclusively 
on a bamboo diet, lacks a functional umami receptor. 
On the other hand, domestic cats, tigers, and cheetahs 
do not have a functional sweet receptor, whereas vam-
pire bats that feed on a blood diet have mutations that 
have eliminated both sweet and umami functional 
receptors.
Bitter Taste Receptor
Bitter taste is thought to have evolved as an aversive 
signal of toxic molecules. Bitter taste sensation is elic-
ited by a variety of compounds, including caffeine, 
nicotine, alkaloids, and denatonium, the most bitter-
tasting chemical known (this compound is sometimes 
added to toxic products that are odorless and tasteless 
to prevent their ingestion).
Bitter tastants are detected by a family of 
approximately 30 G protein–coupled receptors called 


===== Page 2 =====

T2Rs (Figure 29–14). However, different animal spe-
cies contain different numbers of bitter receptors 
(varying from just a handful in the chicken genome 
to over 50 in the western clawed frog; humans have 
28 T2R genes). These receptors recognize bitter com-
pounds that have diverse chemical structures, with 
each T2R tuned to detect a small number of bitter com-
pounds (Figure 29–15C). The T2R receptors recognize 
chemicals with high-affinity binding in the micro-
molar range, allowing detection of minute quantities 
of harmful compounds. A single taste cell expresses 
many, probably most, types of T2R receptors (Figure 
29–16B). This arrangement implies that information 
about different bitter tastants is integrated in individ-
ual taste cells. Because different bitter compounds are 
detected by the same cells, all these compounds elicit 
the same perceptual bitter taste quality. The degree 
of bitterness might be caused by a compound’s effec-
tiveness in activating bitter taste cells.
Interestingly, genetic differences in the ability to 
perceive specific bitter compounds have been identi-
fied in both humans and mice. For example, humans 
are either super-tasters, tasters, or taste-blind to the 
bitter chemical 6-n-propylthiouracil. It was by map-
ping variation in this trait to specific chromosomal 
loci, and then by searching for novel G protein–coupled 
receptor genes within that chromosomal interval, that 
the T2R receptors were first identified. In the case of 
6-n-propylthiouracil detection, the gene responsible 
for the genetic difference has proven to be a particular 
T2R gene. Thus, some bitter compounds may be recog-
nized predominantly by only one of the approximately 
30 T2R receptor types.
Taste cells expressing T2R receptors are found in 
both foliate and circumvallate papillae in mice (Figure 
29–16C). A given taste cell expresses either T2R or T1R 
receptors (ie, one taste cell–one receptor class), but a 
single taste bud can contain taste cells of all types (eg, 
sweet, umami, bitter). Such mixing of cells accords 
with the observation that a single taste bud can be acti-
vated by more than one class of tastant; for example, 
sweet as well as bitter.
Salty Taste Receptor
Salt intake is critical to maintaining electrolyte bal-
ance. Perhaps because electrolytes must be maintained 
within a stringent range, the behavioral response to 
salt is concentration dependent: Low salt concentra-
tions are appetitive, whereas high salt concentrations 
are aversive. How does the response to salt change 
based on concentration? It turns out that multiple taste 
cells detect salt. The essential salt taste receptor cell 
uses the epithelial sodium channel ENaC (see Figure 
29–14). These specialized salt taste receptors are dis-
tinct from sweet, bitter, or umami receptors. At much 
higher salt concentrations, some bitter and sour taste 
cells also respond to salt, although the molecular 
details of detection have not been determined. There-
fore, appetitive concentrations of salt drive responses 
via the ENaC salt taste receptor in the salt-sensing 
cells, whereas high salt concentrations activate the bit-
ter and sour cells and thus trigger behavioral aversion.
Sour Taste Receptor
Sour taste is associated with acidic or fermented 
foods or drink. As with bitter compounds, animals 
are innately averse to sour substances, suggesting that 
the adaptive advantage of sour taste is avoidance of 
spoiled foods. Sour, like the other 4 taste qualities, is 
also detected by its own type of taste receptor cells 
(Figure 29–14). The ion channel Otopetrin-1 (Otop1), a 
proton-selective channel normally involved in the sen-
sation of gravity in the vestibular system, is the sour-
sensing ion channel in the taste system. As expected, a 
knockout of Otop1 in mice eliminated acid responses 
from sour taste receptor cells. Furthermore, mice engi-
neered to express Otop1 in sweet taste receptor cells 
now have sweet cells that also respond to sour stimuli, 
demonstrating that this channel is sufficient to confer 
acid sensing.
Molecular-genetic studies have demonstrated that 
the different taste modalities are detected by distinct 
subsets of taste cells. As we have seen, a combina-
tion of T1R1 and T1R3 is responsible for all umami 
taste, and a combination of T1R2 and T1R3 is needed 
for all sweet taste detection except for the detection 
of high concentrations of sugars, which can be medi-
ated by T1R3 alone. The T1R1 and T1R2 receptors are 
expressed by separate subsets of taste cells, indicating 
that the detection of sweet and umami tastants is seg-
regated. Similarly, receptors and molecular markers 
uniquely define bitter, low salt, and sour taste cells.
A dramatic demonstration that each taste quality 
is detected by a different category of taste cells comes 
from studies of mice lacking a specific taste receptor 
gene or cell type. These studies showed that the loss 
of one taste modality did not affect the others. For 
example, mice in which sweet cells have been geneti-
cally ablated do not detect sugars but still detect amino 
acids, bitter compounds, salts, and sour compounds. 
Similarly, mice engineered to lack specific taste recep-
tors cannot detect the corresponding tastants. For 
instance, mice lacking selective bitter receptors are 
not responsive to the corresponding bitter tastants, 


===== Page 3 =====
702    Part IV / Perception
and mice lacking ENaC cannot detect the taste of salt. 
These types of studies have shown that different tastes 
are detected by different receptors expressed in differ-
ent classes of taste cells that drive specific behaviors.
Studies in mice further indicate that it is the taste 
cells rather than the receptors that determine the ani-
mal’s response to a tastant. The human bitter recep-
tor T2R16 recognizes a bitter tastant that mice cannot 
detect. When this receptor was expressed in mouse 
taste cells that normally express T2R bitter receptors, 
the ligand caused strong taste aversion. However, 
when that receptor was expressed in cells that express 
the T1R2/T1R3 sweet complex (ie, sweet cells), the bit-
ter ligand elicited strong taste acceptance. These find-
ings showed that innate responses of mice to different 
tastants (sweet and bitter in this example) operate via 
labeled lines that link the activation of different subsets 
of taste cells to different behavioral outcomes.
Gustatory Information Is Relayed From the 
Periphery to the Gustatory Cortex
Each taste cell is innervated at its base by the periph-
eral branches of the axons of primary sensory neurons 
(Figure 29–13). Each sensory fiber branches many times, 
innervating several taste cells within taste buds. The 
release of neurotransmitter from taste cells onto the sen-
sory fibers induces action potentials in the fibers and the 
transmission of signals to the sensory cell body.
The cell bodies of gustatory sensory neurons lie 
in the geniculate, petrosal, and nodose ganglia. The 
peripheral branches of these neurons travel in cranial 
nerves VII, IX, and X, while the central branches enter 
the brain stem, where they terminate on neurons in 
the gustatory area of the nucleus of the solitary tract  
(Figure 29–17). In most mammals, neurons in this 
nucleus transmit signals to the parabrachial nucleus of 
the pons, which in turn sends gustatory information to 
the ventroposterior medial nucleus of the thalamus. In 
primates, however, these neurons transmit gustatory 
information directly to the taste area of the thalamus.
From the thalamus, taste information is transmit-
ted to the gustatory cortex, a region of the cerebral 
cortex located along the border between the anterior 
insula and the frontal operculum (Figure 29–17). The 
gustatory cortex is believed to mediate the conscious 
perception and discrimination of taste stimuli. The 
taste areas of the thalamus and cortex also transmit 
information both directly and indirectly to the hypo-
thalamus, which controls feeding behavior and auto-
nomic responses.
Large-scale calcium imaging revealed that some 
neurons in the gustatory cortex respond preferentially 
to one taste modality, such as bitter or sweet. These 
neurons are localized in segregated cortical fields or 
hot spots. Interestingly, using a light-activated ion 
channel to activate neurons in the sweet hot spot elicits 
innately attractive responses. In contrast, activation of 
the bitter hot spot evokes suppression of licking and 
strong aversive orofacial responses, mimicking what is 
often seen in response to bitter tastants. These experi-
ments showed that direct control of primary taste cor-
tex can evoke specific, reliable, and robust behaviors 
that mimic responses to natural tastants. They also 
illustrated that the gustatory pathway can activate 
innate, immediate responses to sweet and bitter chem-
icals. To demonstrate that these cortically triggered 
behaviors are innate (ie, independent of learning or 
experience), similar stimulation experiments were per-
formed in mutant mice that had never tasted sweet or 
bitter chemicals (the mutation abolished all sweet and 
bitter signal transduction). Even in these animals, acti-
vation of the corresponding cortical fields triggered 
the expected behavioral response, thus substantiating 
the predetermined nature of the sense of taste.
Perception of Flavor Depends on Gustatory, 
Olfactory, and Somatosensory Inputs
Much of what we think of as the flavor of foods derives 
from information provided by the integration of the 
taste and olfactory systems. Volatile molecules released 
from foods or beverages in the mouth are pumped into 
the back of the nasal cavity (“retronasal passage”) by 
the tongue, cheek, and throat movements that accom-
pany chewing and swallowing. Although the olfactory 
epithelium of the nose clearly makes a major contribu-
tion to sensations of flavor, such sensations are local-
ized in the mouth rather than in the nose.
The somatosensory system is also thought to be 
involved in this localization of flavors. The coinci-
dence between taste, somatosensory stimulation of 
the tongue, and the retronasal passage of odorants 
into the nose is assumed to cause odorants to be per-
ceived as flavors in the mouth. Sensations of flavor 
also frequently have a somatosensory component 
that includes the texture of food as well as sensations 
evoked by spicy or minty foods and by carbonation.
Insects Have Modality-Specific Taste Cells That 
Drive Innate Behaviors
Insects have a specialized gustatory system that evalu-
ates potential nutrients and toxins in food. Taste neu-
rons are found on the proboscis, internal mouthparts, 
legs, wings, and ovipositor, allowing insects to sample

in taste buds in the oral cavity. Taste buds on the tongue and 
pharynx are innervated by the peripheral fibers of gustatory 
sensory neurons, which travel in the glossopharyngeal, chorda 
tympani and vagus nerves and terminate in the nucleus of the 
solitary tract in the brain stem. From there, taste information is 
relayed through the thalamus to the gustatory cortex as well as 
to the hypothalamus.

the local chemical environment prior to ingestion. As 
in mammals, only a few different types of taste cells 
detect different tastes. In the Drosophila fly, the different 
taste cell classes include those that sense sugars, bitter 
compounds, water, and pheromones. As in mammals, 
activation of these different taste cells drives differ-
ent innate behaviors; for example, activation of sugar 
cells drives food acceptance behavior, whereas activa-
tion of bitter cells drives food rejection. Thus, the basic 
organization of taste detection is remarkably similar in 
insects and mammals, despite divergent evolutionary 
histories.
The taste receptors in insects are not related to ver-
tebrate receptors. Members of the gustatory receptor 
(GR) gene family participate in the detection of sug-
ars and bitter compounds. The GRs are membrane-
spanning receptors that are distantly related to the 
odorant receptors of the fly. The fly has approximately 
70 GR genes, a surprisingly large number considering 
it has approximately 60 olfactory receptor genes. Dif-
ferent GRs are found in sugar cells versus bitter cells, 
with many GRs present in a single neuron. In addi-
tion to GRs, other gene families participate in insect 
taste, including variants of ionotropic glutamate recep-
tors and other ion channel classes. Similar to olfactory 
detection, the gene families involved in taste recog-
nition differ across phyla, demonstrating that the 
gene families for chemical recognition have evolved 
independently.
Highlights
  1.  Odor detection in the nose is mediated by a large 
family of odorant receptors that number approxi-
mately 350 in humans and 1,000 in mice. These 
receptors vary in protein sequence, consistent with 
an ability to detect structurally diverse odorants.


===== Page 5 =====
704    Part IV / Perception
  2.  Individual odorant receptors can detect multiple 
odorants, and different odorants activate differ-
ent combinations of receptors. This combinato-
rial strategy explains how we can discriminate a 
multitude of odorants and how nearly identical 
odorants can have different scents.
  3.  Each olfactory sensory neuron in the nose 
expresses a single type of receptor. Thousands of 
neurons with the same receptor are dispersed in 
the olfactory epithelium and intermingled with 
neurons expressing other receptors.
  4.  In the olfactory bulb, the axons of the sensory 
neurons expressing the same receptor converge 
in a few receptor-specific glomeruli, generating 
a map of odorant receptor inputs that is similar 
among individuals.
  5.  The axons of olfactory bulb projection neurons 
project broadly to multiple areas of the olfactory 
cortex, generating a highly distributed organiza-
tion of cortical neurons responsive to individual 
odorants. The olfactory cortex transmits informa-
tion to many other brain areas.
  6.  In mice, pheromones can be detected in the nose 
or in the vomeronasal organ, a structure absent in 
humans. Signals from the nose and vomeronasal 
organ travel through different neural pathways 
in the brain.
  7.  The olfactory system of the fruit fly Drosophila 
melanogaster resembles that of mammals in many 
aspects. It uses a large number of diverse olfac-
tory receptors, with one or a few olfactory recep-
tors expressed by each olfactory sensory neuron. 
Moreover, neurons with the same receptor syn-
apse in a few specific glomeruli in the antennal 
lobe of the brain. From there, olfactory signals are 
transmitted to two major brain areas involved in 
innate versus learned odor responses. The ease 
of using genetic approaches in fruit flies has ena-
bled rapid study of mechanisms underlying odor 
coding and behavior.
  8.  The gustatory system detects five basic tastes: 
sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami (amino 
acids). Tastants that activate these taste qualities 
are detected by taste receptor cells located pri-
marily in taste buds on the tongue and palate epi-
thelium. The detection of the five different taste 
modalities is mediated by different taste receptor 
cells, each dedicated to one modality.
  9.  Sweet tastants are detected by a single type of 
receptor, which is composed of two subunits, 
T1R2 and T1R3. Umami receptors are related 
but comprise a combination of T1R1 and T1R3 
subunits.
10.  Bitter taste receptors constitute a family of 
approximately 30 related but diverse receptors 
that vary in ligand specificity. Individual taste 
receptor cells express many or all bitter receptors.
11.  In contrast to sweet, umami, and bitter receptors, 
which are all G protein–coupled receptors, salty 
and sour tastes are detected by ion channels: 
ENaC for salt taste and Otopetrin-1 for sour taste.
12.  Taste signals travel from taste buds through cra-
nial nerves from gustatory sensory neurons in 
the geniculate, petrosal, and nodose ganglia via 
labeled lines (sweet taste receptor cells to sweet 
neurons, bitter taste cells to bitter neurons, etc.). 
They then travel to the gustatory area of the 
nucleus of the solitary tract and parabrachial 
nucleus, and from there to the taste area of the 
thalamus and then the gustatory cortex. The 
gustatory cortex, in turn, projects to many brain 
areas, including those involved in motor control, 
feeding, hedonic value, learning, and memory.
13.  The gustatory cortex contains hot spots for sweet 
and bitter taste, which, when directly stimulated, 
can elicit behavioral responses similar to those 
obtained with tastants applied to the tongue.
14.  The fruit fly Drosophila also has a specialized gus-
tatory system that evaluates potential nutrients 
and toxins in food. Different classes of taste cells 
sense sugars, bitter compounds, pheromones, or 
water. Activation of these different peripheral 
sensors drives different innate behaviors, such as 
food acceptance or rejection.

Fresco of dancing Peucetian women from the Tomb of the Dancers in the Corso 
Cotugno necropolis of Ruvo di Puglia, 4th–5th century BC. The tomb has a semicham-
ber design. Its six painted panels depict 30 dancing women, moving from left to right 
with arms interlocked as though they were dancing in a circle around the interior of the 
tomb. The skeletal remains of the deceased in the tomb clearly belonged to a distin-
guished male warrior. The tomb is named after the dancing women that appear on the 
frescoes in the tomb. The panels with the frescoes are now exhibited in the Naples 
National Archaeological Museum, inv. 9353. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
