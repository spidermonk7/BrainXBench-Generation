Figure 26–10  Molecular composition of the transduction 
machinery.
A. The tip link is composed of the heterophilic association of 
protocadherin 15 and cadherin 23. Two transduction channels 
are localized near the lower insertion point of the tip link at 
the tip of the shorter stereocilium. Each channel is part of a 
molecular complex that includes the proteins TMC1/2, LHFPL5, 
and TMIE. At the upper insertion point on the flank of the 
longer stereocilium, cadherin 23 interacts with harmonin b and 
the molecular motor myosin 7a, which both bind to actin and 
thus anchor the tip link. The protein sans serves as a scaffolding 
protein. In vestibular hair cells, myosin 1c may set the tip link 
under tension, but the presence of this motor protein is uncer-
tain in cochlear hair cells.
B. Model of the transduction-channel complex. TMC1/2, LHFPL5, 
and TMIE interact with protocadherin 15 and, thus, with the lower 
end of the tip link. TMIE also interacts with LHFPL5. The detailed 
arrangement of these proteins within the transduction apparatus 
is still unknown. Unlike what the figure suggests, TMC1 has been 
proposed to assemble as a dimer, with each TMC1 molecule  
contributing a permeation pathway for cations. (Adapted, with

in hair-cell stereocilia (TMHS; official nomenclature 
LHFPL5), and transmembrane inner-ear-expressed 
gene (TMIE; Figure 26–10). Mechanotransduction 
is abolished in mouse hair cells lacking TMIE, even 
though all other known components of the trans-
duction machinery appear to be properly in place. 
However, because TMIE contains only two pre-
dicted transmembrane domains, it seems highly 
unlikely that this protein alone constitutes an ion 
channel. In the absence of LHFPL5, the conductance 
of the transduction channel is reduced, but signifi-
cant transduction currents can still be measured, 
suggesting that this protein is not an essential part 
of the channel pore.
Multiple lines of evidence advocate for TMC1 and 
TMC2 as components of the transduction channel. 
Both proteins are localized near the lower insertion 
point of the tip link, where the transduction current 
enters the hair cell, interact with the tip-link constit-
uent protocadherin 15, and their onset of expression 
coincides with that of mechanoelectrical transduction. 
In addition, transduction channels in a mouse carrying 
a single point mutation in the Tmc1 gene show lower 
conductance and Ca2+ permeability, indicating that 
TMC1 is very close to the channel’s pore. Individual

Figure 26–11  Tuning curves for cochlear hair cells.  To con-
struct a curve, the experimenter presents sound at several fre-
quencies. At each frequency, the stimulus intensity is adjusted 
until the cell produces a criterion response, here 1 mV. The 
curve thus reflects the threshold of the cell for stimulation over 
a range of frequencies. Each cell is most sensitive to a specific 
frequency, its characteristic frequency. The threshold rises 
briskly—the sensitivity falls rapidly—as the stimulus frequency 
is raised or lowered. The characteristic frequency depends on 
the position of the hair cell along the longitudinal axis of the 
cochlea. (Reproduced, with permission, from Kiang 1980.

cysteine substitutions made at sites that are predicted 
to be in or near the channel pore confirm that TMC1 
belongs to the main conductive pathway. Indeed, 
covalent modification of the cysteine residues with a 
positively charged reagent leads to a reduction of the 
single-channel conductance in several TMC1 mutants. 
The cysteine-modifying reagent has no effect when 
the reagent is applied after the hair bundle has been 
deflected towards its short edge (to close the transduc-
tion channels) or when access to the channel pore is 
prevented by a channel blocker. TMC1 is thus unlikely 
to constitute an accessory channel subunit that forms 
a vestibule to the pore-forming protein(s). Instead, the 
evidence is strong that TMC1 forms at least part of the 
pore of the transduction channel. In cochlear hair cells, 
TMC1 and TMC2 are coexpressed during neonatal 
development, but only TMC1 expression is maintained 
through adulthood.
Dynamic Feedback Mechanisms Determine the 
Sensitivity of the Hair Cells
Hair cells must cope with acoustic stimuli that have 
a very low energy content. If the stimulus consists of 
a periodic signal, such as the sinusoidal pressure of a 
pure tone, a detection system can increase the signal-
to-noise ratio by enhancing selectively the response 
to a relevant frequency. Hair cells respond best at a 
characteristic frequency of acoustic stimulation. The 
frequency selectivity of a given hair cell results in part 
from passive extrinsic filtering of its mechanical input, 
in particular as a result of the tonotopic arrangement 
of the mammalian basilar membrane. In addition, 
when it is appropriate that low-frequency inputs be 
disregarded, hair cells possess a unique mechanism of 
adaptation that acts as a high-pass filter. Hair cells also 
employ mechanical amplification that enhances and 
further tunes their mechanosensitivity.
Hair Cells Are Tuned to Specific Stimulus Frequencies
Every cochlear hair cell is most sensitive to stimula-
tion at a specific frequency, termed its characteristic, 
natural, or best frequency. On average, the charac-
teristic frequencies of adjacent inner hair cells dif-
fer by approximately 0.2%; adjacent piano strings, in 
comparison, are tuned to frequencies some 6% apart. 
Because the traveling wave evoked even by a pure 
sinusoidal stimulus spreads somewhat along the basi-
lar membrane, the sensitivity of a cochlear hair cell 
extends within a limited range above and below its 
characteristic frequency, the more so with a greater 
level of stimulation. At low levels, a pure tone recruits 
approximately 100 hair cells. The frequency sensitiv-
ity of a hair cell may be displayed as a tuning curve. 
To construct a tuning curve, an experimenter stimu-
lates the ear with pure tones at numerous frequencies 
below, at, and above the cell’s characteristic frequency. 
The level of stimulation is adjusted for each frequency 
until the cell’s response reaches a predefined criterion 
magnitude. The tuning curve is then a graph of sound 
level, presented logarithmically in decibels SPL, as a 
function of stimulus frequency.
The tuning curve for an inner hair cell is typically 
V-shaped (Figure 26–11). The curve’s tip represents 
the cell’s characteristic frequency, the frequency that 
produces the criterion response for the lowest level of 
the stimulus. Sounds of greater or lesser frequencies 
require higher levels to excite the cell to the criterion 
response. As a consequence of the traveling wave’s 
shape, the slope of a tuning curve is far steeper on its 
high-frequency flank than on its low-frequency flank.

In the same way as a tuning fork’s resonant fre-
quency depends on the size of its tines, the heights of the 
hair bundles vary systematically along the tonotopic 
axis. Hair cells that respond to low-frequency stimuli 
have the tallest bundles, whereas those that respond 
to the highest-frequency signals possess the shortest 
bundles. In the human cochlea, for example, an inner 
hair cell with a characteristic frequency of 20 kHz bears 
a 4-μm hair bundle. At the opposite extreme, a cell sen-
sitive to a 20-Hz stimulus has a bundle more than 7 μm 
high. A similar morphological gradient is observed 
with outer hair cells, supplementing the extrinsic tun-
ing accomplished by the basilar membrane.
Hair Cells Adapt to Sustained Stimulation
Despite the precision with which a hair bundle grows, 
it cannot develop in such a way that the sensitive 
transduction apparatus is always perfectly poised 
at its position of greatest mechanosensitivity. Some 
mechanism must compensate for developmental 
irregularities, as well as for environmental changes, by 
adjusting the gating springs so that transduction chan-
nels are responsive to weak stimuli at the bundle’s 
resting position. To ensure this, an adaptation process 
continuously resets the hair bundle’s range of mechan-
ical sensitivity. As a result of adaptation, a hair cell can 
maintain a high sensitivity to transient stimuli while 
rejecting static inputs a million times as large.
Adaptation manifests itself as a progressive 
decrease in the receptor potential during protracted 
deflection of the hair bundle (Figure 26–12). The 
process is not one of desensitization, for the respon-
siveness of the receptor persists. Instead, during a 
prolonged step stimulus, the sigmoidal relationship 
between the initial receptor potential and the bundle’s 
position shifts in the direction of the applied stimulus. 
As a result, the membrane potential of the hair cell 
progressively returns to near its resting value. Adapta-
tion is incomplete, however; the relation between the 
membrane potential and the bundle position shifts by 
approximately 80% of the deflected position.
How does adaptation occur? Because the mechani-
cal force exerted by a hair bundle changes as adaptation 
proceeds, the process evidently involves an adjustment 
in the tension borne by the gating springs. It appears 
likely that the structure anchoring the upper end of 
each tip link, the insertional plaque, is repositioned dur-
ing adaptation by an active molecular motor (Figure 
26–12). The transduction channels are inherently more 
stable in a closed state, for they close when the tip links 
are disrupted. A motor is thus also required to maintain 
a significant fraction (10%–50%) of the transduction 
channels open at rest by continuously pulling on the 
gating springs. Several dozen myosin molecules asso-
ciated with the upper end of each tip link are thought 
to maintain tension by ascending the actin core of the 
stereocilium and pulling the link’s insertion with them.
When a stimulus step increases the tension in a gat-
ing spring, the associated transduction channel opens, 
permitting an influx of cations. As Ca2+ ions accumu-
late in the stereociliary cytoplasm, they reduce the 
upward force of the myosin molecules, thereby short-
ening the gating spring. When the spring reaches its 
resting tension, closure of the channel reduces the Ca2+ 
influx to its original level, restoring a balance between 
the upward force of myosin and the downward ten-
sion in the spring.
Hair bundles contain at least five isoforms of 
myosin, the motor molecule associated with motility 
along actin filaments (Chapter 31). In vestibular hair 
cells, immunohistochemical studies and site-directed 
mutagenesis implicate myosin 1c in adaptation. In 
cochlear hair cells, the role of myosin 1c in adapta-
tion has remained elusive. Another motor protein, 
myosin 7a, is present near the upper insertion point of 
the tip link and mutations in the corresponding gene 
(USH1B) are associated with deafness. Hair-cell bun-
dles defective for myosin 7a are disorganized, suggest-
ing that this motor is involved at least in hair-bundle 
development.
If it were only to set the operating point of the trans-
duction apparatus, adaptation could afford to operate 
on much slower timescales than the period of acous-
tic stimuli. This is the case in response to large deflec-
tions of the hair bundle, for which the time constant 
of adaptation is approximately 20 ms or more when 
endolymph bathes the hair bundle. This slow adapta-
tion is compatible with the activity of a myosin-based 
motor driven by the cyclical hydrolysis of adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP). Yet, after being pulled open by an 
excitatory step stimulus of small magnitude, transduc-
tion channels reclose with typical timescales of less 
than 1 ms and thus short enough to be compatible with 
auditory frequencies. Current models posit that Ca2+ 
ions entering a hair cell through a transduction chan-
nel bind to or near the channel’s pore, thereby energeti-
cally favoring channel closure. The kinetics of this fast 
adaptation varies systematically along the tonotopic 
axis of auditory organs, indicating that adaptation may 
help in setting the hair cell’s characteristic frequency 
of maximal responsiveness. In addition, the recipro-
cal relationship between channel gating and tip-link 
tension means that adaptive channel rearrangements 
evoke internal forces that drive active hair-bundle 
movements. The mechanical correlate of adaptation

Figure 26–12  Adaptation of mechanoelectrical transduction 
in hair cells. A. Prolonged deflection of the hair bundle in the 
positive direction (upper trace) elicits an initial depolarization 
followed by a decline to a plateau and an undershoot at the 
cessation of the stimulus (lower trace). The four schematic 
hair-cell bundles illustrate the states of the transduction chan-
nels before (a) and during the illustrated phases of the adapta-
tion (b–d). Initially, the stimulation increases tension in the tip 
link (second bundle), thus opening transduction channels. As 
stimulation continues, however, a tip link’s upper attachment is 
thought to slide down the stereocilium, allowing each channel 
to close during adaptation (third bundle). Prolonged deflection 
of the hair bundle in the negative direction elicits a comple-
mentary response. The cell is slightly hyperpolarized at first but 
shows a rebound depolarization at the end of stimulation; ten-
sion is restored to the initially slack tip link as myosin molecules 
actively pull up the link’s upper insertion.
B. As adaptation proceeds, the sigmoidal relation between 
hair bundle displacement and the receptor potential of the 
hair cell shifts to the right along the abscissa, in the direc-
tion of the new hair-bundle position (dashed line), without 
substantial changes in the curve’s shape or amplitude. The 
shift explains why the receptor potential decreases over 
time as shown in A between states b and c, restoring the 
membrane potential of the hair cell to near its value when 
there is no stimulus. This result implies that adaptation 
restores mechanical sensitivity to small rapid deflections of 
the hair bundle in the presence of a protracted stimulus that 
would otherwise saturate mechanoelectrical transduction. 
The four states of the transduction channels shown in A are 
marked (a–d). (Adapted, with permission, from Hudspeth

Figure 26–13  The cochlea actively emits sounds.
A. The records display evoked otoacoustic emissions from the ears 
of five human subjects. A brief click (top trace) was played into 
each ear through a miniature speaker. A few milliseconds later, a 
tiny microphone in the external auditory meatus detected one or 
more bursts of sound emission from the ear. (Adapted, with per-

thus provides feedback that can enhance the stimulus 
to the hair cell.
Sound Energy Is Mechanically Amplified  
in the Cochlea
The inner ear faces an important obstacle to efficient 
operation: A large portion of the energy in an acous-
tic stimulus goes into overcoming the damping effects 
of cochlear liquids on hair-cell and basilar-membrane 
motion rather than into excitation of hair cells. The 
sensitivity of the cochlea is too great, and auditory fre-
quency selectivity too sharp, to result solely from the 
inner ear’s passive mechanical properties. The cochlea 
must therefore possess some means of actively ampli-
fying sound energy.
One indication that amplification occurs in the 
cochlea comes from measurements of the basilar 
membrane’s movements with sensitive laser inter-
ferometers. In a preparation stimulated with low-
level sound, the basilar-membrane motion is highly 
dependent on frequency. The movement is maximal 
at the appropriate frequency for the position at which 
the measurement is made—the characteristic fre-
quency—but drops abruptly at higher or lower fre-
quencies. As the sound level is increased, however, 
the frequency selectivity of the vibration becomes less 
sharp; the peak in the relationship between ampli-
tude and frequency broadens. In addition, the mem-
brane’s sensitivity to sound, defined as the vibration 
amplitude per unit of sound pressure, declines pre-
cipitously. When stimulated at the characteristic fre-
quency, the sensitivity of basilar-membrane motion to 
stimulation at 80 dB SPL is less than 1% of that for 
10 dB SPL excitation. The basilar membrane displays 
a compressive nonlinearity that accommodates the 
millionfold variation of sound pressure that charac-
terizes audible sounds (0–120 dB SPL) into only two 
to three orders of magnitude of vibration amplitude 
(±0.3–300 nm). The sensitivity and frequency selectiv-
ity predicted in modeling studies of a passive cochlea 
correspond to those observed with high-level stim-
uli. This result implies that the motion of the basilar 
membrane is augmented more than 100-fold during 
low-level stimulation at the characteristic frequency, 
but that amplification diminishes progressively as the 
stimulus grows in strength. Consequently, amplifica-
tion lowers the threshold of hearing by more than 40 
to 50 dB SPL.
In addition to this circumstantial evidence, experi-
mental observations support the idea that the coch-
lea contains a mechanical amplifier. When a normal 
human ear is stimulated with a click, that ear emits 
one to several measurable pulses of sound within

Figure 26–14  Voltage-induced motion of an outer hair 
cell.  Depolarization of an isolated outer hair cell through the 
electrode at its base causes the cell body to shorten (left); 
hyperpolarization causes it to lengthen (right). The oscillatory 
motions of outer hair cells may provide the mechanical energy 
that amplifies basilar-membrane motion and thus enhances the 
sensitivity of human hearing. (Reproduced, with permission, 
from Holley and Ashmore 1988.)
Because sharp frequency selectivity, high sensi-
tivity, and otoacoustic emissions are also observed in 
animal species that lack outer hair cells and lack high 
concentrations of prestin, electromotility cannot be the 
only form of mechanical amplification by hair cells. 
In addition to detecting stimuli, hair bundles are also 
mechanically active and contribute to amplification. 
Hair bundles can make spontaneous back-and-forth 
movements that have been shown in some nonmam-
mals to underlie spontaneous otoacoustic emissions. 
Under experimental conditions, bundles can exert 
force against stimulus probes, performing mechani-
cal work and thereby amplifying the input. In vitro 
experiments indicate that active hair-bundle motility 
milliseconds (Figure 26–13A). Because they can carry 
more energy than the stimulus, these so-called evoked 
otoacoustic emissions cannot simply be echoes; they rep-
resent the emission of mechanical energy by the coch-
lea, triggered by acoustic stimulation. In accordance 
with the compressive nonlinearity associated with 
cochlear amplification, the relative level of the emis-
sions decreases with the stimulus level.
A still more compelling manifestation of the 
cochlea’s active amplification is spontaneous otoacous-
tic emission. When a suitably sensitive microphone is 
used to measure sound pressure in the ear canals of 
subjects in a quiet environment, at least 70% of normal 
human ears continuously emit one or more pure tones  
(Figure 26–13B). Although these sounds are generally 
too faint to be directly audible by others, physicians 
have reported actually hearing sounds emanating 
from the ears of newborns!
What is the source of evoked and spontaneous 
otoacoustic emissions, and thus presumably of coch-
lear amplification as well? Several lines of evidence 
implicate outer hair cells as the elements that enhance 
cochlear sensitivity and frequency selectivity and 
hence act as the motors for amplification. The afferent 
nerve fibers that extensively innervate the inner hair 
cells make only minimal contacts with the outer hair 
cells (Figure 26–4). Instead, the outer hair cells receive 
an extensive efferent innervation that, when activated, 
decreases cochlear sensitivity and frequency discrimi-
nation. In addition, when stimulated electrically, an 
isolated outer hair cell displays the unique phenom-
enon of electromotility: The cell body shortens by up to 
several micrometers when depolarized and elongates 
when hyperpolarized (Figure 26–14). This response 
can occur at frequencies exceeding 80 kHz, an attrac-
tive feature for a process postulated to assist high-
frequency hearing.
The energy for these movements is drawn from 
the experimentally imposed electrical field rather 
than from hydrolysis of an energy-rich substrate such 
as ATP. Movement occurs when changes in the elec-
tric field across the membrane reorient molecules of 
the protein prestin. The concerted movement of sev-
eral million of these molecules, which are packed in 
the lateral cell membranes of outer hair cells, changes 
the membrane’s area and thus the cell’s length. When 
an outer hair cell transduces mechanical stimulation 
of its hair bundle into receptor potentials, cochlear 
amplification might then occur when voltage-induced 
movement of the cell body augments basilar-membrane 
motion. Consistent with this hypothesis, mutation  
of certain amino acid residues required for the volt-
age sensitivity of prestin abolishes the active process 
in mice.

contributes to the cochlear active process even in the 
mammalian ear.
Active hair-bundle movements can be fast enough 
to mediate otoacoustic emissions at sound frequencies 
at least as high as a few kilohertz. However, it remains 
uncertain whether bundles can generate forces at the 
very high frequencies at which sharp frequency selec-
tivity and otoacoustic emissions are observed in the 
mammalian cochlea. Active hair-bundle motility and 
somatic electromotility may function synergistically, 
with the former serving metaphorically as a tuner 
and preamplifier and the latter as a power amplifier. 
Alternatively, hair-bundle motility may dominate at 
relatively low frequencies but be superseded by elec-
tromotility at higher frequencies.
Cochlear Amplification Distorts Acoustic Inputs
When stimulated by two tones at nearby frequen-
cies f1 and f2 (f1 < f2), the basilar membrane vibrates 
not only at these frequencies but also at additional 
frequencies—the distortion products—that are not 
present in the acoustic stimulus. As reported by the 
Italian violinist Giuseppe Tartini in the 18th century, 
distortion products can be heard as phantom tones 
in the auditory percept. Remarkably, the cubic dif-
ference tone 2f1 – f2 is heard even at very low sound 
levels, and its magnitude grows in proportion to the 
stimulus. Correspondingly, the relative level of distor-
tion remains practically constant over a broad range 
of sound levels. This phenomenon is explained by the 
particular form of the compressive nonlinearity asso-
ciated with cochlear amplification. Clearly, the coch-
lea does not work as a high-fidelity sound receiver. 
Distorted cochlear vibrations are strong enough to be 
reemitted from the ear canal as distortion-product 
otoacoustic emissions. Because they are a property of 
healthy ears, these emissions are extensively used to 
screen hearing in newborns.
The Hopf Bifurcation Provides a General Principle 
for Sound Detection
Detailed in vivo and in vitro studies have revealed 
four cardinal features of auditory responsiveness. 
First, an active amplification process lowers the detec-
tion threshold. Second, because amplification operates 
only near a characteristic frequency, the input to the 
sensory system is actively filtered, which sharpens 
frequency selectivity. Third, for stimulation near the 
characteristic frequency, the response displays a com-
pressive nonlinearity that represents a wide range of 
stimulus levels by a much narrower range of vibration 
amplitudes. Finally, even in the absence of a stimulus, 
mechanical activity can produce self-sustained oscilla-
tions that result in otoacoustic emissions.
These features have been recognized as signatures 
of an active dynamical system—a critical oscillator—
that operates on the verge of an oscillatory instabil-
ity termed the Hopf bifurcation (Box 26–1). They are 
generic: They do not depend on the subcellular and 
molecular details of the candidate mechanism that 
brings the system to the brink of spontaneous oscil-
lation. The fact that active hair-bundle motility dem-
onstrates a Hopf bifurcation in vitro provides further 
evidence that this mechanism contributes to cochlear 
amplification.
Within this framework, the characteristic frequency 
is set by that of the critical oscillator. The cochlear parti-
tion may be viewed as a set of active oscillatory mod-
ules that are hydrodynamically coupled by the cochlear 
fluids and with characteristic frequencies tonotopically 
distributed along the longitudinal axis of the cochlea. 
The hypothesis of critical oscillation facilitates modeling 
of the traveling wave and cochlear amplification. This is 
because the generic behaviors of a critical oscillator can 
be described by a single equation termed the “normal 
form” (Box 26–1). A critical oscillator is ideally suited 
for auditory detection, even if its inherent nonlinearity 
yields pronounced distortions in response to complex 
sound stimuli. Nonlinear interference between the fre-
quency components of complex stimuli in fact appears 
as a necessary price to pay for the exquisite sensitivity, 
sharp frequency selectivity, and wide dynamic range 
of auditory detection afforded by a critical oscillator. 
The Hopf bifurcation provides generic properties that 
account for numerous disparate experimental observa-
tions at the level of a single hair bundle, of the basilar 
membrane, and even in psychoacoustics. This physical 
principle of auditory detection thus greatly simplifies 
our understanding of hearing. Although this chapter 
focusses primarily on mammalian hearing, the com-
mon necessity to hear with high sensitivity and sharp 
frequency selectivity poses similar physical constraints 
to the ears of all land vertebrates. These constraints have 
led to the independent evolution of ears that share simi-
lar structural features and whose operation is based on 
similar physical principles, including the use of critical 
oscillators to amplify sound (Box 26–2).
Hair Cells Use Specialized Ribbon Synapses
Being sensory receptors, hair cells form synapses with 
sensory neurons. The basolateral membrane of each 
cell contains several presynaptic active zones at which

Figure 26–15  Frequency-selective amplification near a 
Hopf bifurcation.
A. As the control parameter C increases to approach the 
critical value CC, the response to a sinusoidal stimulus of 
constant amplitude increases: The system gets more sen-
sitive. For C > CC, the system oscillates spontaneously at 
a constant amplitude and frequency, even if no stimulus 
is applied. The Hopf bifurcation corresponds to C = CC. 
(Reproduced, with permission, from Hudspeth 2014.)
B. When the system is poised at the bifurcation (C = CC), 
the sensitivity to a low-level stimulus is greatly enhanced 
near the characteristic frequency fC (here 5000 Hz; dashed 
line), but drops rapidly if the stimulus is detuned from this 
frequency (red line). For a stimulus 60 dB more intense, 
the maximal sensitivity is 100-fold lower, and the peak in 
sensitivity is 100-fold broader (blue line): A critical oscillator 
enhances the weakest stimuli much more than the strongest 
and with much sharper frequency selectivity. (Adapted, with 
permission, from Hudspeth, Jülicher, and Martin 2010.)
C. At the characteristic frequency fC, the response—here 
displacement—displays a compressive growth that cor-
responds to a line of slope 1/3 in this doubly logarithmic 
plot (red line): A large range of stimulus levels is repre-
sented by a much narrower range of response amplitudes. 
In contrast, when the frequency of the stimulus departs 
significantly from the characteristic frequency (blue line), 
the response is proportional to the input, corresponding 
to a line of slope unity. By amplifying weak inputs near its 
characteristic frequency, the critical oscillator lowers the 
stimulus level required to elicit a threshold vibration, here 
by 60 dB for a threshold of 0.3 nm. (Adapted, with permis-
sion, from Hudspeth, Jülicher, and Martin 2010.)
A dynamical system displays a Hopf bifurcation when 
it abruptly transits from quiescence to a state of sponta-
neous oscillation while subject to continuous variation 
of a control parameter C. If the system is poised in the 
vicinity of the critical point, at which C = CC, its steady-
state response to sinusoidal forces can be described by 
a single equation—the “normal form”—of a complex 
variable Z:
Λ dZ
dt   ≅ -Λ(Cc − C − 2ip fc)Z − B|Z|2 Z + F        (26–1)
Here, the real part of Z may represent the position of 
the basilar membrane or of the hair bundle, Λ is a friction 
coefficient, and F is the external force provided by a sound 
stimulus. In the absence of an external force (F = 0), spon-
taneous oscillations emerge when the control parameter 
becomes larger than the critical value CC (Figure 26-15A); 
the parameter fC corresponds to the frequency of sponta-
neous oscillation at the critical point. A Hopf bifurcation 
must be driven by an active process, whereby the system 
mobilizes internal resources of energy to power sponta-
neous movements. A system operating precisely at the 
critical point is called a critical oscillator. The response of 
a critical oscillator to sinusoidal stimuli is endowed with

Mammals are not alone in possessing sensitive and 
frequency-selective hearing. Amphibians and rep-
tiles, including birds, also do. It is a remarkable fact 
that these various groups of land vertebrates actually 
acquired their good hearing systems largely indepen-
dently. The small, dedicated auditory receptor organ 
was present in the inner ear of their common ancestor. 
Much later, the ancestors of modern lizards, birds, and 
mammals each independently evolved middle-ear sys-
tems with eardrums collecting sound from the outside 
world. Some species, such as birds and their relatives, 
even evolved two groups of sensory hair cells that have 
a division of labor similar to that of mammalian inner 
and outer hair cells. Comparison of middle-ear and 
inner-ear structures and functions across all living ver-
tebrate groups has revealed that they share many com-
mon features and that hearing performance is largely 
comparable between them. Sound amplification associ-
ated with active hair-bundle motility was already pre-
sent in the very first hair cells that evolved, even before 
the first fishes. This amplifying system was inherited 
by all groups and, as described earlier, plays a critical 
role in improving hearing sensitivity and sharpening 
frequency selectivity. The greatest difference between 
mammals and the other groups is that the upper fre-
quency limit of hearing is generally higher in mam-
mals. Nonmammalian ears are limited in response to 
frequencies lower than about 12 to 14 kHz, whereas 
some mammals can hear beyond 100 kHz.
In addition to active hair-bundle motility, the second 
mechanism that tunes individual hair cells to specific 
frequencies in many nonmammalian ears is electrical 
in nature. In many fishes, amphibians, and birds, the 
membrane potential of each hair cell resonates at a par-
ticular frequency. Several factors, including alternative 
splicing of the mRNA encoding cochlear K+ channels 
and expression of these channels’ auxiliary β subunit, 
tune the characteristic frequency of the resonance along 
the tonotopic axis of the auditory organ. Whether elec-
trical resonance contributes to frequency tuning in the 
ears of mammals, including humans, remains uncertain. 
It is plausible that mammalian hair cells use instead an 
interplay between somatic electromotility, which seems 
absent in nonmammalian species, and the microme-
chanical environment, including hair-bundle motility, to 
actively amplify and filter their inputs.
The key signatures of a Hopf bifurcation have been 
recognized in spontaneous mechanical oscillations of 
the hair bundle, in electrical oscillations of the mem-
brane potential, and in sound-evoked vibration of the 
basilar membrane. It is likely that the parallel evolu-
tion of hearing organs in different groups of vertebrates 
resulted in several ways of benefitting from the generic 
properties of critical oscillation.

chemical neurotransmitter is released. An active zone 
is characterized by four prominent morphological fea-
tures (Figure 26–16).
A presynaptic dense body or synaptic ribbon 
lies in the cytoplasm adjacent to the release site. This 
fibrillar structure may be spherical, ovoidal, or flat-
tened, and usually measures a few hundred nanometers 
across. The dense body resembles the synaptic rib-
bon of a photoreceptor cell and represents a special-
ized elaboration of the smaller presynaptic densities 
found at many other synapses. In addition to molecu-
lar components shared with conventional synapses, 
ribbon synapses contain large amounts of the protein 
ribeye.
The presynaptic ribbon is surrounded by clear 
synaptic vesicles, each 35 to 40 nm in diameter, which 
are attached to the dense body by tenuous filaments. 
Between the dense body and the presynaptic cell mem-
brane lies a striking presynaptic density that comprises 
several short rows of fuzzy-looking material. Within 
the cell membrane, rows of large particles are aligned 
with the strips of presynaptic density. These particles 
include the Ca2+ channels involved in the release of 
transmitter as well as the K+ channels that participate 
in electrical resonance in nonmammalian vertebrates.
Studies of nonmammalian experimental models 
show that, as with most other synapses (Chapter 15),  
the release of transmitter by hair cells is evoked by 
presynaptic depolarization and requires influx of Ca2+ 
from the extracellular medium. Hair cells lack synap-
totagmins 1 and 2, however, and the role of those pro-
teins as rapid Ca2+ sensors has probably been assumed 
by the protein otoferlin, which also promotes the 
replenishment of synaptic vesicles. Although gluta-
mate is the principal afferent neurotransmitter, other 
substances are released as well.
The presynaptic apparatus of hair cells has several 
unusual features that underlie the signaling abilities of
