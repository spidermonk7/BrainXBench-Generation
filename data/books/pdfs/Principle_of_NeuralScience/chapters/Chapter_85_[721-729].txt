Figure 28–14  The auditory system of the bat has special-
ized areas for locating sounds.
A. A sonogram of an animal’s calls (solid lines) and the result-
ant echoes (dashed lines) illustrates the two components 
of the call: the protracted, harmonically related constant-
frequency (CF) signal and the briefer frequency-modulated (FM) 
signal. The duration of the calls declines as the animal approaches 
its target. (Adapted, with permission, from Suga 1984.)
B. A view of the cerebral hemisphere of the mustached bat 
shows three of the functional areas within the auditory cor-
tex. The FM area is where the distance from the target is 
computed; the CF area is where the velocity of the target is 
computed; and the Doppler-shifted CF area is specialized for 
the identification of small fluttering objects. The expanded 
cortical representation of Doppler-shifted CF signals near the 
second harmonic of the call frequency (60–62 kHz) forms the 
acoustic “fovea.” (Adapted, with permission, from Suga 1984.)
C. The FM-FM combination-sensitive neuron shown does not 
respond significantly to either pulses or echoes alone, but 
responds very strongly to a closely paired pulse-echo. However, 
the neuron is also sensitive to the time difference between the 
pulse and echo, as seen in the record on the right, where the 
neuron fails to respond to a pulse-echo combination that is not 
closely paired. (Adapted, with permission, from Suga et al. 1983.)

choice of appropriate stimuli is likely to be as impor-
tant in studying these other species as it has been in 
studies of bats.
The Auditory Cortex Is Involved in Processing Vocal 
Feedback During Speaking
Vocal communication involves both speaking and 
hearing, often taking place concurrently. When we 
speak, the sound of our voice is delivered not only to 
the intended listener but also back to our own ears. 
Such feedback to our auditory system during vocal 
production is conducted not only through the air but 
also through bone and can be loud as a result of the 
proximity of the mouth and the ears.
The auditory system must distinguish an auditory 
percept as being self-generated or externally generated. 
To monitor external sounds from the acoustic environ-
ment during speaking, self-generated sounds have to 
be masked. At the same time, the auditory system must 
also monitor our own voice in order to detect errors in 
vocal production. An accurate representation of one’s 
own voice through vocal feedback is crucial to main-
taining desired vocal production and to the learning of 
a new language. In humans and animals, perturbations 
of the vocal feedback can lead to alterations in vocal 
production, and interruptions or blockages of the vocal 
feedback can result in degradation in vocal learning.
The evidence for the involvement of the auditory 
cortex in processing vocal feedback comes from both 
human and animal studies. Responses in the audi-
tory cortex of human subjects to their own voice 
while speaking are smaller than the responses to the 
playback of the same sounds. This reduction can be 
observed in electrocorticographical (ECoG) recordings 
(Figure 28–15A) or with a variety of imaging methods 
(eg, fMRI, PET, magnetoencephalography [MEG]).
Single-neuron recordings from the auditory cortex 
of vocalizing monkeys have shown that self-initiated 
vocalizations result in suppression of cortical responses 
to monkeys’ own vocalizations, of external sounds 
heard during vocalization, and also spontaneous activ-
ity (Figure 28–15B). Because in many instances firing 
rates are suppressed to below spontaneous activity, the 
suppression is likely caused by inhibition. Neurons sup-
pressed by self-initiated vocalizations show frequency 
and intensity tuning, as is typical of auditory cortical 
neurons, and respond to the playback of vocalizations.
The vocalization-induced suppression begins sev-
eral hundred milliseconds prior to the onset of vocali-
zation (Figure 28–15B), suggesting that these neurons 
receive modulatory signals originating in vocal 
production circuits. In humans, vocal production is 
carried out by cortical areas in the frontal lobe, from 
Broca’s area to premotor and motor cortex. In humans 
and monkeys, axons from the premotor cortex to audi-
tory regions of the superior temporal gyrus have been 
described, and presumably, they mediate the vocali-
zation-induced suppression. This modulatory connec-
tion is not active when humans or monkeys simply 
listen to vocal sounds played to them.
Why do we suppress our auditory cortex when we 
speak? A simple answer is that this suppression helps 
reduce the masking effect of our own voice, which can 
be very loud. A more interesting answer is that this 
suppression results from a vocal feedback-monitoring 
network in auditory cortex. In humans, there is less 
or no suppression of auditory cortex if vocal feed-
back is experimentally altered through earphones, for 
example, when the pitch of the voice is shifted (Figure 
28–15A). In marmoset monkeys, neurons suppressed 
by self-initiated vocalizations may become less sup-
pressed or even excited when the animal hears its 
own frequency-shifted vocalizations (Figure 28–15C). 
This sensitivity to feedback perturbations suggests 
that neurons exhibiting vocalization-induced suppres-
sion are part of a network responsible for monitoring 
vocal feedback signals. The presence of vocal feed-
back-related neural activity in the auditory cortex of 
both humans and monkeys suggests that the auditory 
cortex combines both internal modulation and vocal 
feedback responses, rather than merely responding to 
sensory signals coming through the ears.
Not all neurons in the auditory cortex are sup-
pressed by speaking or vocalizing. A smaller propor-
tion (~30%) of neurons in marmoset A1 increase their 
responses during self-initiated vocalizations, consistent 
with their auditory response characteristics. In contrast 
to vocalization-induced suppression, vocalization-
related excitation begins after the onset of vocalization 
and is likely the result of feedback through the ascend-
ing auditory pathway. The vocalization-related excita-
tion may help maintain the sensitivity of the auditory 
cortex to the external acoustic environment during 
speaking or vocalizing.
Vocalization-induced suppression of auditory 
responses has been observed in several mammalian 
subcortical structures, including the brain stem and 
inferior colliculus. Such suppression begins a few 
milliseconds before or is synchronized with vocal 
production. In contrast, cortical suppression begins 
several hundred milliseconds before the vocal onset. 
It is possible that subcortical suppression of auditory 
responses during speaking or vocalizing is initiated by 
cortical commands.

Figure 28–15  Vocal feedback processing in auditory cortex.
A. Examples of vocalization-induced suppression and sensitiv-
ity to pitch perturbation in human cerebral cortex. 1. A subject’s 
vocalizations (red arrow) went through a digital signal proces-
sor that shifted pitch and delivered the distorted auditory feed-
back (blue arrow) to the subject’s earphones. 2. Pitch track of 
an example trial shows the pitch recorded by the microphone 
(produced) and the pitch delivered to the earphones (heard). 
Shaded region indicates the time interval when the signal 
processor shifted the pitch by −200 cents (1 cent = 1/1200 
octave). 3. The locations of electrodes that recorded from two 
sites in the auditory cortex on the surface of the superior tem-
poral gyrus. 4. The Z variable represents the power in the 50 to 
150 Hz (high-γ) range of cortical activity, which has been shown 
to correlate well with neuronal spiking activity. It was extracted 
from the signals recorded at each electrode in the speaking 
(red) and listening (blue) conditions. Vertical lines in the left 
column of plots indicate vocalization onset, and shaded regions 
in the right column of plots indicate the onset and offset of per-
turbation. The response of a subject’s auditory cortex to his or 
her own self-produced vocalization is generally smaller than the 
response seen when the subject passively listens to playback 
of the same vocalization (left column). The response of auditory 
cortex to the perturbation during active phonation (speaking) 
is enhanced (right column). (Adapted, with permission, from 
Houde and Chang, 2015.)
B. 1. Vocalization-induced suppression of neural activity in mar-
moset monkey auditory cortex. Population-averaged firing rate 
of all vocalization-suppressed responses are aligned by vocal 
onset (a “Phee” call). The blue line is a moving average (100 ms 
window) and shows that suppression begins prior to vocaliza-
tion (indicated by arrow). The thick bar indicates the period 
over which suppression is continuously significant (P <0.05).

2. Neurons subject to vocalization-induced suppression are 
sensitive to vocal feedback perturbations. Top: Self-produced 
vocalizations with or without feedback alterations were deliv-
ered to the marmoset through a customized headphone. 
Bottom: This auditory cortical neuron was suppressed during 
normal vocalization (dark blue) but showed a large increase in 
firing rate when the auditory feedback of the vocalization was 
shifted in the frequency domain (light blue). Amplifying audi-
tory feedback alone did not generate firing rate changes (black).

Highlights
  1.  Sound impinging on two ears carries informa-
tion that the brain uses to compute where sounds 
arise and what they mean. Sounds are charac-
terized by the amount of energy at one or more 
frequencies. To determine where sounds arise in 
the horizontal plane, many mammals compute 
differences in the time of arrival at the two ears 
for sounds less than approximately 3,000 Hz. 
To determine where sounds arise in the vertical 
dimension and whether they arise from the front 
or the back, mammals use spectral filtering of 
sounds greater than approximately 6,000 Hz by 
the head, shoulders, and external ears.
  2.  Acoustic information is brought to the brain 
from the cochlea by auditory nerve fibers, each 
sharply tuned to a narrow range of frequen-
cies and together representing the entire hear-
ing range of the animal. Auditory nerve fibers 
terminate in the ventral and dorsal cochlear 
nuclei, distributing acoustic information to four 
major groups of principal cells that form paral-
lel ascending pathways through the brain stem. 
The topographic organization of the auditory 
nerve inputs imparts a tonotopic organization to 
the ipsilateral cochlear nuclei that is preserved 
all along the auditory pathway, including audi-
tory cortex.
  3.  A marked feature of auditory neurons at process-
ing stations along the ascending pathway is their 
progressively increasing stimulus selectivity.
  4.  The ventral cochlear nucleus extracts three fea-
tures of sounds: (a) The monaural pathways 
through octopus cells of the ventral cochlear 
nucleus, the superior paraolivary nucleus, and 
ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus detect 
coincident firing of auditory nerve fibers that is 
useful for detecting onsets and gaps in sounds. 
(b) Stellate cells detect and sharpen the encod-
ing of spectral peaks and valleys and convey 
that spectral information to the dorsal coch-
lear nucleus, olivocochlear neurons in the ven-
tral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, ventral 
nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, inferior col-
liculus, and thalamus. Spectral information is 
used for understanding the meaning of sounds 
and for localizing their sources. (c) Bushy cells 
sharpen and convey information about the fine 
structure of sounds, which is used in the bin-
aural pathways through the medial and lateral 
superior olivary nuclei to make the interaural 
comparisons of timing and intensity of sounds 
at the two ears, which are used to localize sound 
sources along the azimuth.
  5.  The dorsal cochlear nucleus integrates acous-
tic signals with somatosensory information in 
its principal cells. Somatosensory information 
helps distinguish the spectral cues generated by 
an animal’s own movements, which are biologi-
cally uninteresting, from those that arise from 
the environment.
  6.  Auditory brainstem pathways converge in the 
inferior colliculus. The inferior colliculus feeds 
acoustic information through the medial genicu-
late body of the thalamus to auditory cortex.
  7.  A projection from the inferior colliculus carries 
information about the location of sounds to the 
superior colliculus, a part of the brain that con-
trols reflexive orienting movements of the head 
and eyes.
  8.  Within auditory cortex, auditory neurons con-
tinue to become more selective to the stimuli to 
which they respond. Subregions of the auditory 
cortex represent different biologically significant 
features such as pitch of tones that form har-
monic complexes. Auditory cortex also transforms 
rapidly varying features of sounds into firing-
rate-based representations, while representing 
slowly varying sounds using spike timing.
  9.  Auditory circuits in the cerebral cortex are seg-
regated into separate processing streams, with 
dorsal and ventral streams concerned respec-
tively with sound location in space and sound 
identification.
10.  The cerebral cortex modulates processing in 
subcortical auditory areas. Projections from the 
auditory cortex innervate the thalamus, inferior 
colliculus, olivocochlear neurons, some basal 
ganglionic structures, and even the dorsal coch-
lear nucleus.
11.  Auditory cortex is involved in processing vocal 
feedback signals during speaking. Speaking 
induces suppression of neural activity in audi-
tory cortex that begins several hundred millisec-
onds prior to the vocal onset. This suppression 
results from a vocal feedback-monitoring net-
work that functions to guide vocal production 
and learning.

Smell and Taste: The Chemical Senses
Perception of Flavor Depends on Gustatory, Olfactory, 
and Somatosensory Inputs
Insects Have Modality-Specific Taste Cells That Drive 
Innate Behaviors
Highlights
T
hrough the senses of smell and taste, we are 
able to perceive a staggering number and variety 
of chemicals in the external world. These chemi-
cal senses inform us about the availability of foods and 
their potential pleasure or danger. Smell and taste also 
initiate physiological changes required for the diges-
tion and utilization of food. In many animals, the olfac-
tory system also serves an important social function by 
detecting pheromones that elicit innate behavioral or 
physiological responses.
Although the discriminatory ability of humans is 
somewhat limited compared with that of many other 
animals, odor chemists estimate that the human olfac-
tory system may be capable of detecting more than 
10,000 different volatile chemicals. Perfumers who are 
highly trained to discriminate odorants can distinguish 
as many as 5,000 different types of odorants, and wine 
tasters can discern more than 100 different components 
of taste based on combinations of flavor and aroma.
In this chapter, we consider how odor and taste 
stimuli are detected and how they are encoded in 
patterns of neural signals transmitted to the brain. In 
recent years, much has been learned about the mecha-
nisms underlying chemosensation in a variety of ani-
mal species. Certain features of chemosensation have

olfactory sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium, which

A Large Family of Olfactory Receptors Initiate 
the Sense of Smell
Odorants—volatile chemicals that are perceived as 
odors—are detected by olfactory sensory neurons 
in the nose. The sensory neurons are embedded in a 
specialized olfactory epithelium that lines part of the 
nasal cavity, approximately 5 cm2 in area in humans 
(Figure 29–1), and are interspersed with glia-like sup-
porting cells (Figure 29–2). They are relatively short 
lived, with a life span of only 30 to 60 days, and are 
continuously replaced from a layer of basal stem cells 
in the epithelium.
The olfactory sensory neuron is a bipolar nerve 
cell. A single dendrite extends from the apical end to 
the epithelial surface, where it gives rise to numerous

Figure 29–2  The olfactory epithelium.
A. The olfactory epithelium contains sensory neurons inter-
spersed with supporting cells as well as a basal layer of stem 
cells. A single dendrite extends from the apical end of each 
neuron; sensory cilia sprout from the end of the dendrite into 
the mucus lining the nasal cavity. An axon extends from the 
basal end of each neuron to the olfactory bulb.
B. A scanning electron micrograph of the olfactory epithelium 
shows the dense mat of sensory cilia at the epithelial surface. Sup-
porting cells (S) are columnar cells that extend the full depth of the 
epithelium and have apical microvilli. Interspersed among the sup-
porting cells is an olfactory sensory neuron (O) with its dendrite and 
cilia, and a basal stem cell (B). (Reproduced, with permission, from

thin cilia that protrude into the mucus that coats the 
nasal cavity (Figure 29–2). The cilia contain the odor-
ant receptors as well as the transduction machinery 
needed to amplify sensory signals from the receptors 
and transform them into electrical signals in the neu-
ron’s axon, which projects from the basal pole of the 
neuron to the brain. The axons of olfactory sensory 
neurons pass through the cribriform plate, a perfo-
rated region in the skull above the nasal cavity, and 
then terminate in the olfactory bulb (see Figure 29–1).
Mammals Share a Large Family of  
Odorant Receptors
Odorant receptors are proteins encoded by a mul-
tigene family that is evolutionarily conserved and 
found in all vertebrate species. Humans have approxi-
mately 350 different odorant receptors, whereas mice 
have approximately 1,000. Although odorant receptors 
belong to the G protein–coupled receptor superfamily, 
they share sequence motifs not seen in other superfam-
ily members. Significantly, the odorant receptors vary 
considerably in amino acid sequence (Figure 29–3A).
Like other G protein–coupled receptors, odorant 
receptors have seven hydrophobic regions that are 
likely to serve as transmembrane domains (Figure 
29–3A). Detailed studies of other G protein–coupled 
receptors, such as the β-adrenergic receptor, suggest 
that odorant binding occurs in a pocket in the trans-
membrane region formed by a combination of the 
transmembrane domains. The amino acid sequences 
of odorant receptors are especially variable in several 
transmembrane domains, providing a possible basis 
for variability in the odorant binding pocket that could 
account for the ability of different receptors to recog-
nize structurally diverse ligands.
A second, smaller family of chemosensory recep-
tors is also expressed in the olfactory epithelium. 
These receptors, called trace amine-associated recep-
tors (TAARs), are G protein–coupled, but their protein 
sequence is unrelated to that of odorant receptors. 
They are encoded by a small family of genes present 
in humans and mice as well as fish. Studies in mice, 
which have 14 different olfactory TAARs, indicate 
that TAARs recognize volatile amines, one of which 
is present in high concentrations in the urine of male
