filopodia project from the body of the growth cone. 
Between the filopodia lie lamellipodia, which are also 
motile and give the growth cone its characteristic ruf-
fled appearance (Figure 47–6C,D).
Growth cones sense environmental signals through 
their filopodia: rod-like, actin-rich, membrane-limited 
structures that are highly motile. Their surface mem-
branes bear receptors for the molecules that serve as 
directional cues for the axon. Their length—tens of 
micrometers in some cases—permits the filopodia to 
sample environments far in advance of the central core 
of the growth core. Their rapid movements permit 
them to compile a detailed inventory of the environ-
ment, and their flexibility permits them to navigate 
around cells and other obstacles.
When filopodia encounter signals in the envi-
ronment, the growth cone is stimulated to advance, 
retract, or turn. Several motors power these orienting 
behaviors. One source of power is the movement of 
actin along myosin, an interaction similar to the one 
that powers the contraction of skeletal muscle fibers, 
although the actin and myosin of neurons are different 
from those in muscle. The assembly of actin monomers 
into polymeric filaments also contributes a propulsive 
force for filopodial extension. As the actin filaments 
are constantly depolymerized at the base of filopodia, 
the balance of polymerization and depolymerization 
enables the filopodia to move forward without becom-
ing longer. Depolymerization slows during periods of 
growth cone advance, leading to greater net forward 
motion. The movement of membranes along the sub-
strate provides yet another source of forward motion.
The contribution of each type of molecular motor 
to the advance of the growth cone is likely to vary from 
one situation to another. Nevertheless, the final step 
involves the flow of microtubules from the central core 
of the growth cone into the newly extended tip, thus 
moving the growth cone ahead and leaving in its wake 
a new segment of axon. New lamellipodia and filopo-
dia form in the advancing growth cone and the cycle 
repeats (Figure 47–7).
Accurate pathfinding can occur only if the growth 
cone’s motor action is linked to its sensory function. 
Therefore, it is crucial that the recognition proteins on 
the filopodia are signal-inducing receptors and not 
merely binding moieties that mediate adhesion. The 
binding of a ligand to its receptor affects growth in 
diverse ways. In some cases, it engages the cytoskele-
ton directly, through the intracellular domain of recep-
tors (Figure 47–7). Integrin receptors couple to actin 
in growth cones when they bind molecules associated 
with the surface of adjoining cells or the extracellular 
matrix, thereby influencing motility.
Of equal if not greater importance is the ability 
of ligand binding to stimulate the formation, accu-
mulation, and even breakdown of soluble intracel-
lular molecules that function as second messengers. 
These second messengers affect the organization of 
the cytoskeleton, and in this way regulate the direction 
and rate of movement of the growth cone.
One important second messenger is calcium. The 
calcium concentration in growth cones is regulated 
by the activation of receptors on filopodia, and this 
affects the organization of the cytoskeleton, which in 
turn modulates motility. Growth cone motility is opti-
mal within a narrow range of calcium concentrations, 
called a set point. Activation of filopodia on one side of 
the growth cone leads to a concentration gradient of 
calcium across the growth cone, providing a possible 
basis for changes in the direction of growth.
Other second messengers that link receptors and 
motor molecules include cyclic nucleotides, which 
modulate the activity of enzymes such as protein 
kinases, protein phosphatases, and rho-family guano-
sine triphosphatases (GTPases). In turn, these messen-
gers and enzymes regulate the activity of proteins that 
regulate the polymerization and depolymerization of 
actin filaments, thereby promoting or inhibiting axonal 
extension.
The critical role of intracellular signals in growth 
cone motility and orientation can be demonstrated 
using embryonic neurons grown in culture. Applica-
tion of growth factors to one side of a growth cone 
activates receptors locally and leads to extension and 
turning of the growth cone toward the source of the 
signal. In essence, the factor attracts the growth cone. 
Yet when cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) 
levels in the neuron are decreased, the same stimulus 
acts as a repellent and the growth cone turns away 
from the signal (Figure 47–8A). Other repulsive factors 
can become attractive when levels of the second mes-
senger cyclic guanosine 3’,5’-monophosphate (cGMP) 
are raised.
Recently, another mechanism for coupling guid-
ance molecules to growth cone behavior has come to 
light. It was long thought that all neuronal protein 
synthesis occurs in the cell body, but we now know 
that growth cones (as well as some dendrites) con-
tain the machinery for protein synthesis, including a 
subset of messenger RNAs. Initial evidence that these 
molecules play an important role came from experi-
ments in which axons were severed from their parent 
cell body. The growth cones continued to advance for 
a few hours; they could be stimulated to turn toward 
or away from local depots of guidance molecules, and 
these behaviors were abolished by inhibitors of protein

A. A filopodium contacts an adhesive cue and contracts, thus 
pulling the growth cone forward (1). Actin filaments assemble 
at the leading edge of a filopodium and disassemble at the 
trailing edge, interacting with myosin along the way (2). Actin 
polymerization pushes the filopodium forward (3). Force gen-
erated by the retrograde flow of actin pushes the filopodium 
forward. Exocytosis adds membrane to the leading edge of the 
filopodium and supplies new adhesion receptors to maintain 
traction. Membrane is recovered at the back of the filopodium. 
The actin polymer is linked to adhesion molecules on the 
plasma membrane.
B. The combined action of these motors creates an actin-
depleted space that is filled by the advance of microtubules 
from the central core.

synthesis. The local protein synthesis is regulated by 
second messengers produced in response to activa-
tion of guidance receptors on the growth cones (Figure 
47–8). This mechanism leads to synthesis of new motor 
proteins precisely when and where they are needed. 
Thus, the growth cone has many strategies and mecha-
nisms for integrating molecular signals to direct the 
axon in specific directions.

A. The state of protein kinase A (PKA) activity can alter the 
growth cone’s response to an extracellular orienting factor, in

low, the growth cone is repelled by netrin. When PKA activity 
is high, the resulting elevation in intracellular cAMP causes

Molecular Cues Guide Axons to Their Targets
For much of the 20th century, a debate raged between 
advocates of two very different views of how growth 
cones navigate embryonic terrains to reach their tar-
gets. A molecular view of axonal guidance was first 
articulated at the turn of the 20th century by the physi-
ologist J. N. Langley. But by the 1930s, many emi-
nent biologists, including Paul Weiss, believed that 
axonal outgrowth was essentially random and that 
appropriate connections persisted largely because of 
productive, matching patterns of electrical activity in 
the axon and its target cell.
In our molecular age, Weiss’s ideas may seem sim-
plistic, but they were not unreasonable at the time. 
In tissue culture, axons grow preferentially along 
mechanical discontinuities (scratches and bumps on 
a cover slip), and embryonic nerve trunks often align 
themselves with solid supports (blood vessels or carti-
lage). It seemed logical to Weiss that mechanical guid-
ance, called stereotropism, could account for axonal 
patterning. Today, we are quite comfortable with the 


===== Page 4 =====
Chapter 47 / The Growth and Guidance of Axons    1167
idea that electrical signals can be used to change the 
way current flows in a computer without the need 
to resolder connections. Likewise, patterns of activ-
ity and experience can strengthen or weaken neural 
connections without requiring the formation of new 
axonal pathways. Then why not consider that congru-
ent activity, called resonance by Weiss, is involved in 
establishing appropriate connections?
Today, few scientists believe that stereotaxis or 
resonance is a crucial force in initial patterning of 
neuronal circuits. The tipping point that shifted opin-
ion in favor of the molecular view was an experi-
ment performed with frogs and other amphibia in the 
1940s by Roger Sperry (ironically, a student of Weiss). 
Sperry manipulated the information carried from the 
eye to the brain by the axons of retinal ganglion cells. 
These axons terminate in their target areas—the lat-
eral geniculate body in the thalamus and the superior 
colliculus (called optic tectum in lower vertebrates) in 
the midbrain—in such a way that an orderly retino-
topic map of the visual field is created.
Because of the optics of the eye, the visual image 
on the retina is an inversion of the visual field. The 
retinal ganglion cells reinvert the image by the pattern 
in which their axons terminate in the optic tectum, 
the main visual center in the brain of frogs (Figure 
47–9A). If the optic nerve is cut, the animal is blinded. 
In lower vertebrates, cut retinal axons can reestab-
lish projections to the tectum, whereupon vision is 
restored. This is not the case in mammals, as we will 
discuss in Chapter 50.
Sperry’s key experiment was to sever the optic 
nerve in a frog and then rotate the eye in its socket 
by 180° before regeneration of the nerve. Remarkably, 
the frog exhibited orderly responses to visual input, 
but the behavior was wrong. When the frog was pre-
sented with a fly on the ground, it jumped up, and 
when offered a fly above its head, it struck downward 
(Figure 47–9B). Importantly, the animal never learned 
to correct its mistakes. Sperry suggested—and later 
verified with anatomical and physiological methods—
that the retinal axons had reinnervated their original 
tectal targets, even though these connections pro-
vided the brain with erroneous spatial information 
that led to aberrant behavior. The inference of these 
experiments was that recognition between axons and 
their targets relied on molecular matching rather 
than functional validation and refinement of random 
connections.
But Weiss’s ideas are by no means obsolete. 
Indeed, we now recognize that the activity of neu-
ral circuits can play a crucial role in shaping connec-
tivity. The current view is that molecular matching 
predominates during embryonic development and 
that activity and experience modify circuits after they 
have formed. In this chapter and the next, we describe 
the molecular cues that guide the formation of neural 
connections, and then in Chapter 49, we examine the 
role of activity and experience in the fine-tuning of 
synaptic connections.
Sperry’s conjecture, often called the chemospeci-
ficity hypothesis, prompted developmental neurobiol-
ogists to search for axonal and synaptic “recognition 
molecules.” Success was limited for the first few dec-
ades, in part because these molecules are present in 
small amounts and on discrete subsets of neurons 
and there were no effective methods for isolating 
rare molecules from complex tissues. Eventually 
advances in biochemical and molecular-biological 
methods made this task more feasible, and many 
proteins involved in the guidance of axons to their 
targets have now been discovered. These proteins 
typically consist of paired ligands and receptors: The 
ligands are presented by cells along the pathway an 
axon follows and the receptors by the growth cone 
itself.
In the most general terms, guidance cues can be 
presented on cell surfaces, in the extracellular matrix, 
or in soluble form. As described above (Figure 47–8), 
they interact with receptors embedded in the growth 
cone membrane to promote or inhibit outgrowth of the 
axon. Most receptors have an extracellular domain that 
selectively binds the cognate ligand and an intracellular 
domain that couples to the cytoskeleton, either directly 
or through intermediates such as second messengers. 
The ligands can speed or slow growth. Ligands pre-
sented to one side of the growth cone can result in local 
activation or inhibition, leading to turning. In this way, 
the local distribution of environmental cues determines 
the pathway of the advancing growth cone.
As a result of these recent discoveries, axon 
guidance—a process that appeared mysterious years 
ago—can now be viewed as the orderly consequence 
of protein–protein interactions that instruct the growth 
cone to grow, turn, branch, or stop (Figures 47–10, 11). 
This limited set of instructions is sufficient, when pre-
sented with spatial precision, to choreograph growth 
cone behaviors with exquisite subtlety. Axonal guid-
ance can therefore be explained by describing how 
and where ligands are presented and how the growth 
cone integrates this information to generate an orderly 
response. In the rest of the chapter, we illustrate les-
sons learned by describing the journeys of two types of 
axons: those of retinal ganglion neurons and those of a 
particular class of sensory relay neurons in the spinal 
cord.

Figure 47–9  Roger Sperry’s classical experiments on  
regeneration in the visual system provided evidence for 
chemoaffinity in the wiring of connections.
A. In the visual system of the frog, the lens projects an inverted 
visual image onto the retina and the optic nerve then transfers 
the image, with an additional inversion, to the optic tectum. 
The spatial arrangement of retinal inputs to the tectum allows 
for this transfer. Neurons in the anterior retina project axons 
to the posterior tectum, while neurons in the posterior retina 
project to the anterior tectum. Similarly, neurons in the dorsal 
retina project to the ventral tectum, and neurons in the ventral 
retina project to the dorsal tectum. As a result, visually guided 
behaviors (here catching a fly) are accurate. (Abbreviations: A, 
anterior; D, dorsal; P, posterior; V, ventral.)
B. If the optic nerve is cut and the eye is surgically rotated in its 
socket before the nerve regenerates, visually guided behavior 
is aberrant. When a fly is presented overhead, the frog per-
ceives it as below, and vice versa. The inversion of behavioral 
reflexes results from the connection of regenerating retinal 
axons to their original targets, even though these connections 
now transfer an inverted, inappropriate map of the world into 
the brain.
The Growth of Retinal Ganglion Axons Is 
Oriented in a Series of Discrete Steps
Sperry’s experiment implied the existence of axon 
guidance cues but did not reveal where they were or 
how they worked. For a time, one prominent view 
was that recognition occurred mostly at or near 
the target and that mechanical forces or long-range 
chemotactic factors sufficed to get axons to the vicin-
ity of the target.
We now know that axons reach distant targets in 
a series of discrete steps, making frequent decisions at 
closely spaced intervals along their route. To illustrate 
this point, we shall trace in greater detail the path that 
Sperry was trying to understand, that of a retinal axon 
growing to the optic tectum.

Chapter 47 / The Growth and Guidance of Axons    1171
Figure 47–11  (Opposite) Diverse molecular families control 
the growth and guidance of developing axons.
A. A large family of classical cadherins promote cell and axonal 
adhesion, primarily through homophilic interactions between 
cadherin molecules on adjacent neurons. Adhesive interac-
tions are mediated through interactions of the extracellular EC1 
domains. Cadherins transduce adhesive interactions though 
their cytoplasmic interactions with catenins, which link cadher-
ins to the actin cytoskeleton.
B. A diverse array of immunoglobulin superfamily proteins 
are expressed in the nervous system and mediate adhesive 
interactions. The three examples shown here, NCAM, L1, and 
TAG1, can bind both homophilically and heterophilically to pro-
mote axon outgrowth and adhesion. These proteins contain 
both immunoglobulin domains (circles) and fibronectin type III 
domains (squares). Homophilic interactions typically involve 
amino terminal immunoglobulin domains. Different immuno-
globulin adhesion molecules interact with the cytoskeleton via 
diverse cytoplasmic mediators, only a few of which are shown 
here.
C. Different ephrin proteins bind to Eph class tyrosine kinase 
receptors. Class A ephrins are linked to the surface membrane 
through a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol tether, whereas class B 
ephrins are transmembrane proteins. Class A ephrins typically 
bind class A Eph kinases, and class B ephrins typically bind 
class B Eph kinases. Forward Eph signaling usually elicits repel-
lant or inhibitory responses in receptive cells, whereas reverse 
ephrin signaling can elicit adhesive or inhibitory responses. 
Ephrin-Eph signaling involves many different cytoplasmic 
mediators.
D. Laminin proteins are components of the extracellular matrix 
and promote cell adhesion and axon extension through interac-
tions with integrin receptors. Integrins mediate adhesion and 
axon growth through interactions with the cytoskeleton via 
many intermediary proteins.
E. Semaphorin proteins can promote or inhibit axonal growth 
through interaction with a diverse array of plexin and neuropilin 
receptors, which transduce signals via Rho class GTPases and 
downstream kinases.
F. Slit proteins typically mediate repellant responses through 
interaction with Robo class receptors, which influence axonal 
growth via intermediary GTPases such as Rac.
G. The secreted or extracellular matrix–associated netrin 
proteins mediate both chemoattractant and chemorepellent 
responses. Attractant responses are mediated through interac-
tion with DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) receptors, whereas 
repellent responses involve interactions with DCC and unc-5 
coreceptors. Netrin receptors signal via GTPases and cyclic 
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) cascades.
Growth Cones Diverge at the Optic Chiasm
The first task of the axon of a retinal ganglion cell is 
to leave the retina. As it enters the optic fiber layer, it 
extends along the basal lamina and glial end-feet at the 
retina’s edge. The growth of the axon is oriented from 
the outset, indicating that it can read directional cues 
in the environment. As it approaches the center of the 
retina, it comes under the influence of attractants ema-
nating from the optic nerve head (the junction of the 
optic nerve with the retina proper), which guide it into 
the optic stalk. It then follows the optic nerve toward 
the brain (Figure 47–12).
The first axons to travel this route follow the cells 
of the optic stalk, the rudiment of the neural tube that 
connects the retina to the diencephalon from which it 
arose. These “pioneer” axons then serve as scaffolds 
for later-arriving axons, which are able to extend 
accurately simply by following their predecessors (see  
“fasciculation” in Figure 47–10). Once they reach the 
optic chiasm, however, the retinal axons must make 
a choice. Axons that arise from neurons in the nasal 
hemiretina of each eye cross the chiasm and proceed to 
the opposite side of the brain, whereas those from the 
temporal half are deflected as they reach the chiasm and 
so stay on the same side of the brain (Figure 47–13A).
This divergence in trajectory reflects the differen-
tial responses of axons from the nasal and temporal 
hemiretinas to guidance cues presented by midline 
chiasm cells. Some retinal axons contact and traverse 
chiasm cells, whereas others are inhibited by these 
cells and deflected away, thus remaining on the ipsi-
lateral side. One of the key molecules presented by 
chiasm cells is a membrane-bound repellent of the 
ephrin-B family (Figure 47–13B), which also figures in 
later steps of retinal ganglion cell axon guidance.
The fraction of temporal retinal axons that project 
ipsilaterally varies among species: few in lower verte-
brates, some in rodents, and many in humans. These 
differences reflect placement of the eyes. In many ani-
mals, the eyes point to the sides and monitor different 
parts of the visual world, so that information from the 
two eyes need not be combined. In humans, both eyes 
look forward and sample largely overlapping regions 
of the visual world, so coordination of visual input is 
essential.
After crossing the optic chiasm, retinal axons assem-
ble in the optic tract along the ventral surface of the 
diencephalon. Axons then leave the tract at different 
points. In most vertebrate species, the tectum of the 
midbrain (called the superior colliculus in mammals) 
is the major target of retinal axons, but a small num-
ber of axons project to the lateral geniculate nucleus of 
the thalamus. In humans, however, most axons project 
to the lateral geniculate, a sizable number reach the

Figure 47–12  The axons of retinal ganglion cells grow to 
the optic tectum in discrete steps.  Two neurons that carry 
information from the nasal half of the retina are shown. The 
axon of one crosses the optic chiasm to reach the contralateral 
optic tectum. The axon of the other also crosses the optic chi-
asm but projects to the lateral geniculate nucleus. The numbers 
indicate important landmarks on the axon’s journey. The grow-
ing axon is directed toward the optic nerve head (the junction 
of the nerve with the retina) (1), enters into the optic nerve 
(2), extends through the optic nerve (3), swerves to remain 
ipsilateral (not shown) or crosses to the contralateral side at the 
optic chiasm (4), extends through the optic tract (5), enters into 
the optic tectum or lateral geniculate nucleus (not shown) (6), 
navigates to an appropriate rostrocaudal and dorsoventral position 
on the tectum (7), turns to enter the neuropil (descends in chicks 
as shown here; ascends in mammals) (8), stops at an appropriate 
layer where a rudimentary terminal arbor is formed (9), and finally 
is remodeled (10). (Abbreviations: A, anterior; P, posterior).

colliculus, and small numbers project to the pulvinar, 
superchiasmatic nucleus, and pretectal nuclei. Within 
these targets, different retinal axons project to differ-
ent regions. As Sperry showed, the retinal axons form 
a precise retinotopic map on the tectal surface. Similar 
maps form in other areas innervated by retinal axons 
such as the lateral geniculate nucleus.
Having reached an appropriate position within 
the tectum, retinal axons need to find an appropriate 
synaptic partner. To achieve this last leg of their jour-
ney, retinal axons turn and dive into the tectal neuropil 
(Figure 47–12), descending (or, in mammals, ascend-
ing) along the surface of radial glial cells, which pro-
vide a scaffold for radial axonal growth. Although 
radial glial cells span the entire extent of the neu-
roepithelium, each retinal axon confines its synaptic 
terminals to a single layer. The dendrites of many post-
synaptic cells extend through multiple layers and form 
synapses along their entire length, but retinal inputs 
are restricted to a small fraction of the target neuron’s 
dendritic tree. These organizational features imply that 
layer-specific cues arrest axonal elongation and trigger 
arborization.
The problem of long-distance axon navigation is 
therefore solved by dividing the journey into short 
segments in which intermediate targets guide the 
axons along the path to their final targets. Some inter-
mediate targets, such as the optic chiasm, are “decision” 
regions where axons diverge.
Reliance on intermediate targets is an effective 
solution to the problem of long-distance axonal navi-
gation but is not the only one. In some cases, the first 
axons reach their targets when the embryo is small and 
the distance to be covered is short. These “pioneer” 
axons respond to molecular cues embedded in cells 
or the extracellular matrix along their way. The first 
axons to exit the retina fall within this class. Axons that 
appear later, when distances are longer and obstacles 
more numerous, can reach their targets by following 
the pioneers. Yet another guidance mechanism is a 
molecular gradient. Indeed, as we will see, gradients 
of cell-surface molecules in the tectum inform axons 
about their proper termination zone.
Gradients of Ephrins Provide Inhibitory  
Signals in the Brain
So far, we have seen how retinal axons reach the tectum 
by responding to a series of discrete directional cues. 
However, these choices during growth do not account
