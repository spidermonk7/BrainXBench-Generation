Figure 19–12  The somatosensory areas of the cerebral cor-
tex in the human brain.
A. The somatosensory areas of cortex lie in the parietal lobe 
and consist of three major divisions. The primary somatosen-
sory cortex (S-I) forms the anterior part of the parietal lobe. 
It extends throughout the postcentral gyrus beginning at the 
bottom of the central sulcus, extending posteriorly to the 
postcentral sulcus, and into the medial wall of the hemisphere 
to the cingulate gyrus (not shown). The S-I cortex comprises 
four distinct cytoarchitectonic regions: Brodmann’s areas 3a, 
3b, 1, and 2. The secondary somatosensory cortex (S-II) is 
located on the upper bank of the lateral sulcus (Sylvian fis-
sure) and on the parietal operculum; it covers Brodmann’s 
area 43. The posterior parietal cortex surrounds the intrapari-
etal sulcus on the lateral surface of the hemisphere, extend-
ing from the postcentral sulcus to the parietal-occipital sulcus 
and medially to the precuneus. The superior parietal lobule 
(Brodmann’s areas 5 and 7) is a somatosensory area; the infe-
rior parietal lobule (areas 39 and 40) receives both somatosen-
sory and visual inputs.
B. A coronal section through the postcentral gyrus illustrates 
the anatomical relationship of S-I, S-II, and the primary motor 
cortex (area 4). S-II lies adjacent to area 2 in S-I and extends 
medially along the upper bank of the lateral sulcus to the 
insular cortex. The primary motor cortex lies rostral to area 3a 
within the anterior wall of the central sulcus.
cortex (S-I), whereas the VPS nucleus conveys proprio-
ceptive information principally to area 3a.
The Somatosensory Cortex Is Organized Into 
Functionally Specialized Columns
Conscious awareness of touch is believed to originate 
in the cerebral cortex. Tactile information enters the 
cerebral cortex through the primary somatosensory 
cortex (S-I) in the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe. 
The primary somatic sensory cortex comprises four 
cytoarchitectural areas: Brodmann’s areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 
2 (Figure 19–12). These areas are interconnected such 
that processing of sensory information in S-I involves 
both serial and parallel processing.
In a series of pioneering studies of the cerebral cor-
tex, Vernon Mountcastle discovered that S-I cortex is 
organized into vertical columns or slabs. Each column 
is 300 to 600 μm wide and spans all six cortical lay-
ers from the pial surface to the white matter (Figure 
19–13). Neurons within a column receive inputs from 
the same local area of skin and respond to the same 
class or classes of touch receptors. A column there-
fore comprises an elementary functional module of 
the neocortex; it provides an anatomical structure that 
organizes sensory inputs to convey related informa-
tion about location and modality.
The columnar organization of the cortex is a direct 
consequence of intrinsic cortical circuitry, the projec-
tion patterns of thalamocortical axons, and migration 
pathways of neuroblasts during cortical development. 
The pattern of connections within a column is ori-
ented vertically, perpendicular to the cortical surface. 
Thalamocortical axons terminate primarily on clus-
ters of stellate cells in layer IV, whose axons project 
vertically toward the surface of the cortex, as well as 
on star pyramid cells. Thus, thalamocortical inputs 
are relayed to a narrow column of pyramidal cells 
that are contacted by the layer IV cell axons. The api-
cal dendrites and axons of cortical pyramidal cells in 
other cortical layers are also largely oriented vertically, 
parallel to the thalamocortical axons and stellate cell 
axons (Figure 19–14). This allows the same information 
to be processed by a column of neurons throughout the 
thickness of the cortex.
Pyramidal neurons form the principal excitatory 
class of somatosensory cortex; they compose approxi-
mately 80% of S-I neurons. Pyramidal neurons in

Figure 19–13  Organization of neuronal circuits 
within a column of somatosensory cortex. Sensory 
inputs from the skin or deep tissue are organized in 
columns of neurons that run from the surface of the 
brain to the white matter. Each column receives tha-
lamic input primarily in layer IV from one part of the 
body. Excitatory neurons in layer IV send their axons 
vertically toward the surface of the cortex, contacting 
the dendrites of pyramidal neurons in layers II and III 
(supragranular layers) as well as the apical dendrites of 
pyramidal cells in the infragranular layers (layers V and 
VI). In this manner, tactile information from a body part 
such as a finger is distributed vertically within a column 
of neurons.

Figure 19–14  Columnar organization of the somatosensory 
cortex. Cortical excitatory neurons in the six layers have distinc-
tive pyramidal-type shapes with large cell bodies, a single apical 
dendrite that projects vertically toward the cortical surface and 
arborizes in more superficial layers, and multiple basal dendrites 
that arborize close to the cell body. Pyramidal neurons differ 
in size, gene expression patterns, the length and thickness of 
their apical dendrite, and the projection targets of their axons. 
All of these neurons synapse on targets within the cerebral 
cortex. Additionally, the pyramidal neurons in layer V project 
subcortically to the spinal cord, brain stem, midbrain, and basal 
ganglia. Corticothalamic neurons in layer VI project back to the 
afferent thalamic nucleus providing sensory input to that col-
umn. Spiny stellate neurons in layer IV are the only excitatory 
cells shown that are not pyramidal neurons. (Adapted, with per-

each of the six cortical layers project to specific targets 
(Figure 19–14). Recurrent horizontal connections link 
pyramidal neurons in the same or neighboring col-
umns, allowing them to share information when acti-
vated simultaneously by the same stimulus. Neurons 
in layers II and III also project to layer V in the same 
column, to higher cortical areas in the same hemi-
sphere, and to mirror-image locations in the opposite 
hemisphere. These feedforward connections to higher 
cortical areas allow complex signal integration, as 
described later in this chapter.
Pyramidal neurons in layer V provide the princi-
pal output from each column. They receive excitatory 
inputs from neurons in layers II and III in the same 
and adjacent columns as well as sparse thalamocorti-
cal inputs. Neurons in the superficial portion of layer 
V (layer V-A) send feedforward outputs bilaterally 
to layer IV of higher-order cortical areas (see Figure 
19–17C) as well as to the striatum. Neurons deeper 
in layer V (layer V-B) project to subcortical structures, 
including the basal ganglia, superior colliculus, pon-
tine and other brain stem nuclei, the spinal cord, and 
dorsal column nuclei. Layer VI neurons project to local 
cortical neurons, and back to the thalamus, particu-
larly to regions of the ventral posterior nuclei provid-
ing inputs to that column.
In addition to feedforward signals of information 
from touch receptors, feedback signals from layers II 
and III of higher somatosensory cortical areas are pro-
vided to layer I in lower cortical areas, regulating their 
excitability. Such feedback signals originate not only 
in somatosensory cortical areas but also in sensorimo-
tor areas of the posterior parietal cortex, frontal motor 
areas, limbic areas, and regions of the medial temporal 
lobe involved in memory formation and storage. These 
feedback signals are thought to play a role in the selec-
tion of sensory information for cognitive processing 
(by the mechanisms of attention) and in short-term 
memory tasks. Feedback pathways may also gate sen-
sory signals during motor activity. Various local inhibi-
tory interneurons within each column serve to focus 
columnar output.
Cortical Columns Are Organized Somatotopically
The columns within the primary somatic sensory cor-
tex are arranged topographically such that there is a 
complete somatotopic representation of the body in 
each of the four areas of S-I (Figure 19–15). The corti-
cal map of the body corresponds roughly to the spinal 
dermatomes (see Figure 18–13). Sacral segments are 
represented medially, lumbar and thoracic segments 
centrally, cervical segments more laterally, and the 
trigeminal representation of the face at the most lateral 
portion of S-I cortex. Knowledge of the neural map of 
the body in the brain is important for localizing dam-
age to the cortex from stroke or head trauma.
The body surface is represented in at least 10 dis-
tinct neural maps in the parietal lobe: four in S-I, four in 
S-II, and at least two in the posterior parietal cortex. As 
a result, these regions mediate different aspects of tac-
tile sensation. Neurons in areas 3b and 1 of S-I process 
details of surface texture, whereas those in area 2 rep-
resent the size and shape of objects. These attributes of 
somatic sensation are further elaborated in S-II and the 
posterior parietal cortex, where neurons are engaged in 
object discrimination and manipulation, respectively.
Another important feature of somatotopic maps 
is the amount of cerebral cortex devoted to each body 
part. The neural map of the body in the human brain, 
termed the homunculus, does not duplicate exactly the 
spatial topography of the skin. Rather, each part of 
the body is represented in proportion to its importance 
to the sense of touch. Disproportionately large areas are 
Figure 19–15  (Opposite) Each region of the primary soma-
tosensory cortex contains a topographic neural map of the 
entire body surface. (Adapted, with permission, from Nelson

A. The primary somatosensory cortex in the macaque monkey 
lies caudal to the central sulcus as in the human brain. The 
colored areas on the macaque cortex correspond to the homol-
ogous Brodmann’s areas of the human brain in Figure 19–12. 
Area 5 in the macaque monkey is homologous to areas 5 and 7 
in humans. Area 7 in macaques is homologous to areas 39 and 
40 in humans. 
B. The flat map diagram on the right shows the somatosensory 
cortex of the macaque monkey unfolded along the central sulcus 
(dotted line that parallels the border between areas 3b and 1). 
The upper part of the diagram includes cortex unfolded from 
the medial wall of the hemisphere. Body maps were obtained 
from microelectrode recordings in the postcentral gyrus. The 
body surface is mapped to columns within rostrocaudal bands 
arranged in the order of the spinal dermatomes. The body maps 
in areas 3b and 1 form mirror images of the distal-proximal or 
dorsal-ventral axes of each dermatome. Each finger (D5–D1) 
has its own representation along the medial-lateral axis of the 
cortex in areas 3b and 1, but inputs from several adjacent fin-
gers converge in the receptive fields of neurons in areas 2 and 5.
C. Cortical magnification of highly innervated skin areas. 
Although the trunk (violet) is covered by a greater area of skin 
than the fingers (red), the number of cortical columns respond-
ing to touch on the fingers is nearly three times the number 
activated by touching the trunk because of the higher innerva-
tion density of the fingers.

The rodent whisker-barrel system is a widely used ani-
mal model in modern neuroscience. Most mammals and 
all primates except man possess specialized tactile hairs 
on their face called vibrissae. Distinct from other hairs on 
the skin, vibrissae grow from a follicle that is densely 
innervated by the trigeminal cranial nerve and sur-
rounded by a blood-filled sinus.

devoted to certain body regions, particularly the hand, 
foot, and mouth, and relatively smaller areas to more 
proximal body parts. In humans and monkeys, more 
cortical columns are devoted to the fingers than to the 
entire trunk (Figure 19–15C).
The amount of cortical area devoted to a unit area 
of skin—called the cortical magnification—varies by more 
than a hundredfold across different body surfaces. It 
is closely correlated with the innervation density and 
thus the spatial acuity of the touch receptors in an area 
of skin. The areas with greatest magnification in the 
human brain—the lips, tongue, fingers, and toes—
have tactile acuity thresholds of 0.5, 0.6, 1.0, and 4.5 mm, 
respectively.
Rodents and other mammals that probe the envi-
ronment with their whiskers have a large number of 
columns in S-I, named barrels, that receive inputs from 
individual vibrissae on the face (Box 19–2). Barrel cor-
tex provides a widely used experimental preparation 
for studying cortical circuitry.

Chapter 19 / Touch    457
The Receptive Fields of Cortical Neurons Integrate 
Information From Neighboring Receptors
The neurons in S-I are at least three synapses beyond 
touch receptors in the skin. Their inputs represent 
information processed in the dorsal column nuclei, the 
thalamus, and the cortex itself. Each cortical neuron 
receives inputs arising from receptors in a specific area 
of the skin, and these inputs together are its receptive 
field. We perceive that a particular location on the skin 
is touched because specific populations of neurons in 
the cortex are activated. This experience can be induced 
experimentally by electrical or optogenetic stimulation 
of the same cortical neurons.
The receptive fields of cortical neurons are much 
larger than those of somatosensory fibers in periph-
eral nerves. For example, the receptive fields of SA1 
and RA1 fibers innervating the fingertip are tiny spots 
on the skin (Figure 19–5), whereas those of the corti-
cal neurons receiving these inputs cover an entire 
fingertip or several adjacent fingers (Figure 19–17B). 
The receptive field of a neuron in area 3b represents a 
Figure 19–16  (Opposite)  The “barrel cortex” of rodents 
represents the vibrissae in topographic patterns.  The 
barrel cortex, a subregion of the rodent primary soma-
tosensory (S-I) cortex that represents the facial vibrissae, 
is a widely studied structure used to decipher cortical  
circuits. (Adapted from Bennett-Clarke et al. 1997 and 
Wimmer et al. 2010.)
A. Tangential histological section through layer IV of the 
somatosensory cortex of a juvenile rat stained for sero-
tonin. The darker immunoreactive patches correspond to 
cortical representations of specific body parts. The largest 
part of the rodent somatosensory cortical map is devoted 
to the vibrissae.
B. Enlarged view of the macrovibrissae representation in 
S-I. The spatial pattern of the whiskers on the face is ste-
reotyped from animal to animal, allowing each cortical “barrel” 
to be identified by row with the letter, and by arc (column) 
with the number of the corresponding whisker. Neurons in 
each barrel are most responsive to motion of this principal 
whisker.
C. A rat brain section cut obliquely along the path axons 
travel from the ventroposterior medial (VPM) thalamic 
nucleus to S-I. Green fluorescent protein–labeled VPM 
axons project through the internal capsule (IC) to the sub-
cortical white matter and travel parallel to the pial surface 
before entering the cortex. The axons densely innervate 
layer IV where they form discrete barrels and more 
sparsely and diffusely innervate the border of layers V and 
VI. Scale bar = 1 mm.
D. The topographic arrangement of the barrels in the cor-
tex matches the spatial arrangement of vibrissae on the 
face in rows (letters) and arcs (numbers).
Many mammalian species actively move these large 
facial whiskers using specialized muscles that wrap like 
slings around each individual follicle. Mice and rats, two 
of the most commonly used vertebrate model organisms, 
rely more heavily on their sense of whisker-mediated 
touch than on their other senses during exploration.
Rodents rhythmically sweep their whiskers across 
objects in much the same way that humans palpate 
objects with their fingertips. Despite their structural 
differences, vibrissae and fingertips afford similar psy-
chophysical thresholds and discriminative sensitivities. 
Whiskers mediate diverse abilities, including localizing 
objects in space, discriminating textures and shapes, 
navigating the environment, interacting socially, and 
capturing prey.
The rodent somatosensory cortex has evolved pro-
portional to this system’s high ethological relevance. For 
instance, the rat somatosensory cortex is thicker than the 
primary visual cortex of the cat, a highly visual animal.
The representation of the largest whiskers (mac-
rovibrissae) in rodent S-I is enlarged relative to that of 
other parts of the body (Figure 19–16). In contrast to the 
continuous representations of the skin or retina, the cor-
tical networks dedicated to processing information from 
individual whiskers are discrete and anatomically iden-
tifiable. Each whisker maps one-to-one onto a distinct 
cluster of excitatory neurons visible in cortical layer IV 
called a barrel.
Barrels are densely interconnected networks that 
are established during development by the interaction of 
thalamocortical axons with cortical neurons. This unique 
correspondence facilitates diverse studies of cortical micro-
circuits, development, experience-dependent plasticity, 
sensorimotor integration, tactile behavior, and disease.

Figure 19–17  The hand area of S-I cortex.
A. This sagittal section through the hand representation 
illustrates the rostrocaudal anatomy of the four subregions 
of S-I (areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 2) in the human brain and the 
adjacent primary motor cortex (area 4) and posterior pari-
etal cortex (area 5). Labels on the cortical surface indicate 
columns representing individual fingers (D2–D5); arrows 
to the right denote the section orientation in the brain. The 
four S-I regions process different types of somatosensory 
information indicated by color-matched rectangles below 
the cortical section. Neurons in area 5 respond mainly to 
goal-directed active hand movements. (Abbreviations: RA1, 
rapidly adapting type 1; RA2, rapidly adapting type 2; SA1, 
slowly adapting type 1.)
B. Typical receptive fields of neurons in each area of S-I of 
macaque monkeys are shown as colored patches on the 
hand icons. The fields are outlined by applying light touch 
to the skin or moving individual joints. Receptive fields are 
smallest in areas 3a and 3b, where tactile information first 
enters the cortex, and are progressively larger in areas 1, 2, 
and 5, reflecting convergent inputs from neurons in area 3b 
that are stimulated together when the hand is used. Neu-
rons in area 5 and in S-II cortex often have bilateral recep-
tive fields because they respond to touch at mirror-image 
locations on both hands. (Adapted from Gardner 1988;  
Iwamura et al. 1993; Iwamura, Iriki, and Tanaka 1994.)
C. Feedforward hierarchical connections between soma-
tosensory cortical areas. The strength of thalamocortical 
and corticocortical connections is indicated by the thick-
ness of arrows interconnecting these areas. Neurons in 
the thalamus send their axons mainly to areas 3a and 3b, 
but some also project to areas 1 and 2. In turn, neurons in 
cortical areas 3a and 3b project to areas 1 and 2. Informa-
tion from the four areas of S-I is conveyed to neurons in the 
posterior parietal cortex (area 5) and in S-II. Many of these 
connections are bidirectional; neurons in higher order corti-
cal areas project back to lower order regions, particularly to 
layer I. (PR, parietal rostroventral cortex; PV, parietal ventral 
cortex; VPL, ventral posterior lateral nuclei; VPM, ventral 
posterior medial nuclei; VPS, ventral posterior superior 
nuclei). (Adapted, with permission, from Felleman and

composite of inputs from 300 to 400 nerve fibers, and 
typically covers a single phalanx or palm pad. Inputs 
from SA1 and RA1 touch receptors in the same skin 
region converge on common neurons in area 3b.
Receptive fields in higher cortical areas are even 
larger, spanning functional regions of skin that are 
activated simultaneously during motor activity. These 
include the tips of several adjacent fingers, or an entire 
finger, or both the fingers and the palm. Neurons in 
areas 1 and 2 of S-I are concerned with information 
more abstract than just their innervation sites on the 
body. Neurons whose receptive fields include more 
than one finger fire at higher rates when several fingers 
are touched simultaneously and, in this way, signal the 
size and shape of objects held in the hand. These large 
receptive fields allow cortical neurons to integrate the 
fragmented information from individual touch recep-
tors, enabling us to recognize the overall shape of an 
object. For example, such neurons may distinguish the 
handle of a screwdriver from its blade.
Convergent inputs from different sensory recep-
tors in S-I may also allow individual neurons to detect 
the size and shape of objects. Whereas neurons in areas 
3b and 1 respond only to touch and neurons in area 
3a respond to muscle stretch, many of the neurons 
in area 2 receive both inputs. Thus, neurons in area 2 
can integrate information about the hand shape used 
to grasp an object, the grip force applied by the hand, 
and the tactile stimulation produced by the object; this 
integrated information may be sufficient to recognize 
the object.
The receptive fields of cortical neurons usually 
have an excitatory zone surrounded by or superim-
posed upon inhibitory zones (Figure 19–18A). Stimula-
tion of regions of skin outside the excitatory zone may 
reduce the neuron’s responses to tactile stimulation 
within the receptive field. Similarly, repeated stimula-
tion within the receptive field may also decrease neu-
ronal responsiveness because the excitability of the 
pathway is diminished by longer lasting inhibition 
mediated by local interneurons.
Inhibitory receptive fields result from feedforward 
and feedback connections through interneurons in 
the dorsal column nuclei, the thalamus, and the cor-
tex itself that limit the spread of excitation. Inhibition 
generated by strong activity in one circuit reduces the 
output of nearby neurons that are only weakly excited. 
The inhibitory networks ensure that the strongest of

B. Convergence of three presynaptic neurons with the same 
arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory zones allows direction 
and orientation selectivity in a neuron in area 2. 1. Downward 
motion of a horizontal bar across the receptive field of the post-
synaptic cell produces a strong excitatory response because the 
excitatory fields of all three presynaptic neurons are contacted 
simultaneously. Upward motion of the bar strongly inhibits fir-
ing because it enters all three inhibitory fields first. The neuron 
responds poorly to upward motion through the excitatory field 
because the initial inhibition outlasts the stimulus. 2. Motion of 
a vertical bar across the receptive field evokes a weak response 
because it simultaneously crosses the excitatory and inhibitory 
receptive fields of the input neurons. Motion to the left or right 
cannot be distinguished in this example.

several competing responses is transmitted, permit-
ting a winner-take-all strategy. These circuits prevent 
blurring of tactile details such as texture when large 
populations of touch neurons are stimulated. In addi-
tion, higher centers in the brain use inhibitory circuits 
to focus attention on relevant information from the 
hand when it is used in skilled tasks, by suppressing 
unwanted, distracting inputs.
The size and position of receptive fields on the skin 
are not fixed permanently but can be modified by expe-
rience or injury to sensory nerves (Chapter 53). Cortical 
receptive fields appear to be formed during develop-
ment and maintained by simultaneous activation of 
the input pathways. If a peripheral nerve is injured or 
transected, its cortical projection targets acquire new 
receptive fields from less effective sensory inputs that 
are normally suppressed by inhibitory networks, or 
from newly developed connections from neighboring 
skin areas that retain innervation. Likewise, extensive 
stimulation of afferent pathways through repeated 
practice may strengthen synaptic inputs, improving 
perception and thereby performance.
Touch Information Becomes Increasingly 
Abstract in Successive Central Synapses
Somatosensory information is conveyed in parallel 
from the four areas of S-I to higher centers in the 
cortex, such as the secondary somatosensory cortex 
(S-II), the posterior parietal cortex, and the primary 
motor cortex (Figure 19–17C). As information flows 
toward higher-order cortical areas, specific com-
binations of stimulus patterns are needed to excite 
individual neurons.
Signals from neighboring neurons are combined 
in higher cortical areas to discern global properties of 
objects such as their orientation on the hand, or the 
direction of motion (Figure 19–19). In general, corti-
cal neurons in higher cortical areas are concerned with 
sensory features that are independent of the stimu-
lus position in their receptive field, abstracting object 
properties common to a particular class of stimuli.
A cortical neuron is able to detect the orientation 
of an edge or the direction of motion because of the 
spatial arrangement of the presynaptic receptive fields. 
The receptive fields of the excitatory presynaptic neu-
rons are typically aligned along a common axis that 
generates the preferred orientation of the postsynaptic 
neuron. In addition, the receptive fields of inhibitory 
presynaptic neurons at one side of the excitatory fields 
reinforce the orientation and direction selectivity of 
postsynaptic neurons (Figure 19–18B).
Cognitive Touch Is Mediated by Neurons in the 
Secondary Somatosensory Cortex
An S-I neuron’s response to touch depends primarily 
on input from within the neuron’s receptive field. This 
feedforward pathway is often described as a bottom-up 
process because the receptors in the periphery are the 
principal source of excitation of S-I cortical neurons.
Higher-order somatosensory areas not only receive 
information from peripheral receptors but are also 
strongly influenced by top-down cognitive processes, 
such as goal-setting and attentional modulation. Data 
obtained from a variety of studies—single-neuron stud-
ies in monkeys, neuroimaging studies in humans, and 
clinical observations of patients with lesions in higher-
order somatosensory areas—suggest that the ventral and 
dorsal regions of the parietal lobe serve complementary 
functions in the touch system similar to the “what” and 
“where” pathways of the visual system (see Figure 17–13).
S-II is located on the upper bank and adjacent pari-
etal operculum of the lateral sulcus in both humans 
and monkeys (Figures 19–12B and 19–20B). Like S-I, 
the S-II cortex contains four distinct anatomical sub-
regions with separate maps of the body. The central 
zone—consisting of S-II proper and the adjacent pari-
etal ventral area—receives its major input from areas 
3b and 1, largely tactile information from the hand and 
face. A more rostral region, the parietal rostroventral 
area, receives information from area 3a about active 
hand movements as well as tactile information from 
areas 3b and 1 (Figure 19–20). The most caudal soma-
tosensory region of the lateral sulcus extends onto the 
parietal operculum (Figure 19–12A). This region abuts 
the posterior parietal cortex and plays a role in inte-
grating somatosensory and visual properties of objects.
Physiological studies indicate that S-II plays key 
roles in tactile recognition of objects placed in the hand 
(stereognosis), distinguishing spatial features, such as 
shape and texture, and temporal properties, such as 
vibratory frequency. The receptive fields of neurons in 
S-II are larger than those in S-I, covering the entire sur-
face of the hand, and are often bilateral, representing 
symmetric, mirror-image locations on the contralateral 
and ipsilateral hands. Such large receptive fields enable 
us to sense the shape of an entire large object grasped 
in one hand, allowing us to integrate the overall con-
tours of a tool as it contacts the palm and different fin-
gers. Bilateral receptive fields enable us to perceive still 
larger objects with two hands, such as a watermelon or 
basketball, sharing the load between them.
The large receptive fields of S-II neurons also 
influence their physiological responses to motion and 
vibration. S-II neurons do not represent vibration as
