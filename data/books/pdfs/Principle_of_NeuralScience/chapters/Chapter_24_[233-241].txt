Membrane Potential and the Passive Electrical 
Properties of the Neuron
I
nformation is carried within neurons and from 
neurons to their target cells by electrical and chemi-
cal signals. Transient electrical signals are particu-
larly important for carrying time-sensitive information 
rapidly and over long distances. These transient elec-
trical signals—receptor potentials, synaptic potentials, 
and action potentials—are all produced by temporary 
changes in the electric current into and out of the cell, 
changes that drive the electrical potential across the 
cell membrane away from its resting value. This cur-
rent represents the flow of negative and positive ions 
through ion channels in the cell membrane.
Two types of ion channels—resting and gated—
have distinctive roles in neuronal signaling. Resting 
channels are primarily important in maintaining the 
resting membrane potential, the electrical potential 
across the membrane in the absence of signaling. Some 
types of resting channels are constitutively open and 
are not gated by changes in membrane voltage; other 
types are gated by changes in voltage but are also open 
at the negative resting potential of neurons. Most voltage-
gated channels, in contrast, are closed when the mem-
brane is at rest and require membrane depolarization 
to open.
In this and the next several chapters, we consider 
how transient electrical signals are generated in the 
neuron. We begin by discussing how particular ion 
channels establish and maintain the membrane poten-
tial when the membrane is at rest and briefly describe 
the mechanism by which the resting potential can be 
perturbed, giving rise to transient electrical signals

such as the action potential. We then consider how the 
passive electrical properties of neurons—their resistive 
and capacitive characteristics—contribute to the inte-
gration and local propagation of synaptic and receptor 
potentials within the neuron. In Chapter 10 we exam-
ine the detailed mechanisms by which voltage-gated 
Na+, K+, and Ca2+ channels generate the action poten-
tial, the electrical signal conveyed along the axon. Syn-
aptic potentials are considered in Chapters 11 to 14, 
and receptor potentials are discussed in Part IV in con-
nection with the actions of sensory receptors.
The Resting Membrane Potential Results  
From the Separation of Charge Across  
the Cell Membrane
The neuron’s cell membrane has thin clouds of positive 
and negative ions spread over its inner and outer sur-
faces. At rest, the extracellular surface of the membrane 
has an excess of positive charge and the cytoplasmic 
surface an excess of negative charge (Figure 9–1). This 
Figure 9–1  The cell membrane potential results from the 
separation of net positive and net negative charges on 
either side of the membrane. The excess of positive ions 
outside the membrane and negative ions inside the membrane 
represents a small fraction of the total number of ions inside 
and outside the cell at rest.

separation of charge is maintained because the lipid 
bilayer of the membrane is a barrier to the diffusion 
of ions (Chapter 8). The charge separation gives rise 
to the membrane potential (Vm), a difference of electrical 
potential, or voltage, across the membrane defined as
Vm = Vin − Vout ,
where Vin is the potential on the inside of the cell and 
Vout the potential on the outside.
The membrane potential of a cell at rest, the resting 
membrane potential (Vr), is equal to Vin since by conven-
tion the potential outside the cell is defined as zero. Its 
usual range is −60 mV to −70 mV. All electrical signal-
ing involves brief changes away from the resting mem-
brane potential caused by electric currents across the 
cell membrane.
The electric current is carried by ions, both posi-
tive (cations) and negative (anions). The direction of 
current is conventionally defined as the direction of net 
movement of positive charge. Thus, in an ionic solution, 
cations move in the direction of the electric current and 
anions move in the opposite direction. In the nerve cell 
at rest, there is no net charge movement across the 
membrane. When there is a net flow of cations or ani-
ons into or out of the cell, the charge separation across 
the resting membrane is disturbed, altering the electri-
cal potential of the membrane. A reduction or reversal 
of charge separation, leading to a less negative mem-
brane potential, is called depolarization. An increase in 
charge separation, leading to a more negative mem-
brane potential, is called hyperpolarization.
Changes in membrane potential that do not lead to 
the opening of gated ion channels are passive responses 
of the membrane and are called electrotonic potentials. 
Hyperpolarizing responses are almost always passive, 
as are small depolarizations. However, when depolari-
zation approaches a critical level, or threshold, the cell 
responds actively with the opening of voltage-gated 
ion channels, which produces an all-or-none action 
potential (Box 9–1).
The Resting Membrane Potential Is 
Determined by Nongated and  
Gated Ion Channels
The resting membrane potential is the result of the 
passive flux of individual ion species through several 
classes of resting channels. Understanding how this 
passive ionic flux gives rise to the resting potential 
enables us to understand how the gating of different

Reliable techniques for recording the electrical potential 
across cell membranes were developed in the late 1940s. 
These techniques allow accurate recordings of both the rest-
ing membrane potential and action potentials (Figure 9–2).
Glass micropipettes filled with a concentrated salt 
solution serve as electrodes and are placed on either 
side of the cell membrane. Wires inserted into the back 
ends of the pipettes are connected via an amplifier to 
an oscilloscope, which displays the amplitude of the 
membrane potential in volts. Because the diameter of 
such a microelectrode tip is minute (<1 μm), it can be 
inserted into a cell with relatively little damage to the 
cell membrane (Figure 9–2A).
As a result, the inside of the membrane becomes 
more positive while the outside of the membrane 
becomes more negative. This decrease in the separation 
of charge is called depolarization.

When both electrodes are outside the cell, no electri-

microelectrode is inserted into the cell, the oscilloscope 
shows a steady voltage, the resting membrane potential. 
In most nerve cells at rest, the membrane potential is 
approximately −65 mV (Figure 9–2B).

The membrane potential can be experimentally 
changed using a current generator connected to a sec-
ond pair of electrodes—one intracellular and one 
extracellular. When the intracellular electrode is made 
positive with respect to the extracellular one, a pulse of 
positive current from the current generator causes posi-
tive charge to flow into the neuron from the intracellular 
electrode. This current returns to the extracellular elec-
trode by flowing outward across the membrane.

Small depolarizing current pulses evoke purely 
electrotonic (passive) potentials in the cell—the size of 
the change in potential is proportional to the size of the 
current pulses. However, a sufficiently large depolar-
izing current triggers the opening of voltage-gated ion 
channels. The opening of these channels leads to the 
action potential, which differs from electrotonic poten-
tials in the way in which it is generated as well as in 
magnitude and duration (Figure 9–2C).
Reversing the direction of current—making the 
intracellular electrode negative with respect to the extra-
cellular electrode—makes the membrane potential more 
negative. This increase in charge separation is called 
hyperpolarization.

Hyperpolarization does not trigger an active

increases proportionately (Figure 9–2D).

types of ion channels generates the action potential, as 
well as the receptor and synaptic potentials.
No single ion species is distributed equally on the 
two sides of a nerve cell membrane. Of the four most 
abundant ions found on either side of the cell mem-
brane, Na+ and Cl− are concentrated outside the cell and 
K+ and A− (organic anions, primarily amino acids and 
proteins) inside. Table 9–1 shows the distribution of 
these ions inside and outside of one particularly well-
studied nerve cell process, the giant axon of the squid, 
whose extracellular fluid has a salt concentration simi-
lar to that of seawater. Although the absolute values of 
the ionic concentrations for vertebrate nerve cells are 
two- to three-fold lower than those for the squid giant 
axon, the concentration gradients (the ratio of the exter-
nal to internal ion concentration) are similar.
The unequal distribution of ions raises several 
important questions. How do ionic gradients contrib-
ute to the resting membrane potential? What prevents 
the ionic gradients from dissipating by diffusion of 
ions across the membrane through the resting chan-
nels? These questions are interrelated, and we shall 
answer them by considering two examples of mem-
brane permeability: the resting membranes of glial 
cells, which are permeable to only one species of ion, 
and the resting membranes of nerve cells, which are 
permeable to three. For the purposes of this discussion, 
we shall only consider the resting channels that are not 
gated by voltage and thus are always open.
Open Channels in Glial Cells Are Permeable to 
Potassium Only
The permeability of a cell membrane to a particular ion 
species is determined by the relative proportions of the 
various types of ion channels that are open. The sim-
plest case is that of the glial cell, which has a resting 
potential of approximately −75 mV. Like most cells, a 
glial cell has high concentrations of K+ and A− on the

inside and high concentrations of Na+ and Cl− on the 
outside. However, most resting channels in the mem-
brane are permeable only to K+.
Because K+ ions are present at a high concentration 
inside the cell, they tend to diffuse across the mem-
brane from the inside to the outside of the cell down 
their chemical concentration gradient. As a result, the 
outside of the membrane accumulates a net positive 
charge (caused by the slight excess of K+) and the inside 
a net negative charge (because of the deficit of K+ and 
the resulting slight excess of anions). Because opposite 
charges attract each other, the excess positive charges 
on the outside and the excess negative charges on the 
inside collect locally on either surface of the membrane 
(Figure 9–1).
The flux of K+ out of the cell is self-limiting. The 
efflux of K+ gives rise to an electrical potential difference—
positive outside, negative inside. The greater the flow 
of K+, the more charge is separated and the greater 
is the potential difference. Because K+ is positive, the 
negative potential inside the cell tends to oppose the 
further efflux of K+. Thus, K+ ions are subject to two 
forces driving them across the membrane: (1) a chemi-
cal driving force, a function of the concentration gradi-
ent across the membrane, and (2) an electrical driving 
force, a function of the electrical potential difference 
across the membrane.
Once K+ diffusion has proceeded to a certain point, 
the electrical driving force on K+ exactly balances the 
chemical driving force. That is, the outward movement 
of K+ (driven by its concentration gradient) is equal to 
the inward movement of K+ (driven by the electrical 
potential difference across the membrane). This poten-
tial is called the K+ equilibrium potential, EK (Figure 9–3). 
In a cell permeable only to K+ ions, EK determines the 
resting membrane potential, which in most glial cells is 
approximately −75 mV.
The equilibrium potential for any ion X can be cal-
culated from an equation derived in 1888 from basic

Since RT/F is 25 mV at 25°C (77°F, room tempera-

Figure 9–3  The flux of K+ across a cell membrane is deter-
mined by both the K+ concentration gradient and the mem-
brane potential.
A. In a cell permeable only to K+, the resting potential is gener-
ated by the efflux of K+ down its concentration gradient.
B. The continued efflux of K+ builds up an excess of positive 
charge on the outside of the cell and leaves behind an excess 
of negative charge inside the cell. This buildup of charge leads 
to a potential difference across the membrane that impedes 
the further efflux of K+, so eventually an equilibrium is reached: 
The electrical and chemical driving forces are equal and oppo-
site, so as many K+ ions move in as move out.
The Nernst equation can be used to find the equilib-
rium potential of any ion that is present on both sides 
of a membrane permeable to that ion (the potential is 
sometimes called the Nernst potential). The equilibrium 
potentials for the distributions of Na+, K+, and Cl− ions 
across the squid giant axon are given in Table 9–1.
In our discussion so far, we have treated the gener-
ation of the resting potential as a passive mechanism—the 
diffusion of ions down their chemical gradients—
one that does not require the expenditure of energy by 
the cell. However, energy from hydrolysis of adeno-
sine triphosphate (ATP) is required to set up the initial 
concentration gradients and to maintain them in neu-
rons, as we shall see below.
Open Channels in Resting Nerve Cells Are 
Permeable to Three Ion Species
Unlike glial cells, nerve cells at rest are permeable to 
Na+ and Cl− ions in addition to K+ ions. Of the abun-
dant ion species in nerve cells, only the large organic 
anions (A−) are unable to permeate the cell membrane. 
How are the concentration gradients for the three per-
meant ions (Na+, K+, and Cl−) maintained across the 
membrane of a single cell, and how do these three

gradients interact to determine the cell’s resting mem-
brane potential?
To answer these questions, it is easiest to examine 
first only the diffusion of K+ and Na+. Let us return to 
the simple example of a cell having only K+ channels, 
with concentration gradients for K+, Na+, Cl−, and A− as 
shown in Table 9–1. Under these conditions, the rest-
ing membrane potential Vr  is determined solely by the 
K+ concentration gradient and is equal to EK (−75 mV) 
(Figure 9–4A).
Now consider what happens if a few resting 
Na+ channels are added to the membrane, making it 
slightly permeable to Na+. Two forces drive Na+ into 
the cell: Na+ tends to flow into the cell down its chemi-
cal concentration gradient, and it is driven into the cell 
by the negative electrical potential difference across 
the membrane (Figure 9–4B). The influx of Na+ depo-
larizes the cell, but only slightly from the K+ equilib-
rium potential (−75 mV). The new membrane potential 
does not come close to the Na+ equilibrium potential of 
+55 mV because there are many more resting K+ chan-
nels than Na+ channels in the membrane.
As soon as the membrane potential begins to depo-
larize from the value of the K+ equilibrium potential, K+ 
flux is no longer in equilibrium across the membrane. 
The reduction in the electrical force driving K+ into the 
cell means that there is now a net flow of K+ out of  
the cell, tending to counteract the Na+ influx. The more 
the membrane potential is depolarized and driven 
away from the K+ equilibrium potential, the greater is 
the net electrochemical force driving K+ out of the cell 
and consequently the greater the net K+ efflux. Even-
tually the membrane potential reaches a new resting 
level at which the increased outward movement of K+ 
just balances the inward movement of Na+ (Figure 
9–4C). This balance point (usually approximately −65 mV) 
is far from the Na+ equilibrium potential (+55 mV) and 
is only slightly more positive than the K+ equilibrium 
potential (−75 mV).
To understand how this balance point is deter-
mined, bear in mind that the magnitude of the flux of 
an ion across a cell membrane is the product of its 
electrochemical driving force (the sum of the electrical 
and chemical driving forces) and the conductance of 
the membrane to the ion:
ion flux = (electrical driving force 
+ chemical driving force) 
× membrane conductance.
In a resting nerve cell, relatively few Na+ channels 
are open, so the membrane conductance of Na+ is quite 
low. Thus, despite the large chemical and electrical 
forces driving Na+ into the cell, the influx of Na+ is 
small. In contrast, many K+ channels are open in the 
membrane of a resting cell so that the membrane con-
ductance of K+ is relatively large. Because of the high 
conductance of K+ relative to Na+ in the cell at rest, the 
small net outward force acting on K+ is enough to pro-
duce a K+ efflux equal to the Na+ influx.
The Electrochemical Gradients of Sodium, 
Potassium, and Calcium Are Established by Active 
Transport of the Ions
As we have seen, the passive movement of K+ out of 
the resting cell through open channels balances the 
passive movement of Na+ into the cell. However, this 
steady leakage of ions cannot be allowed to continue 
unopposed for any appreciable length of time because 
the Na+ and K+ gradients would eventually run down, 
reducing the resting membrane potential.
Dissipation of ionic gradients is prevented by the 
sodium-potassium pump (Na+-K+ pump), which moves 
Na+ and K+ against their electrochemical gradients: 
It extrudes Na+ from the cell while taking in K+. The 
pump therefore requires energy, and the energy comes 
from hydrolysis of ATP. Thus, at the resting membrane 
potential, the cell is not in equilibrium but rather in 
a steady state: There is a continuous passive influx of 
Na+ and efflux of K+ through resting channels that is 
exactly counterbalanced by the Na+-K+ pump.
As we saw in the previous chapter, pumps are sim-
ilar to ion channels in that they catalyze the movement 
of ions across cell membranes. However, they differ in 
two important respects. First, whereas ion channels are 
passive conduits that allow ions to move down their 
electrochemical gradient, pumps require a source of 
chemical energy to transport ions against their electro-
chemical gradient. Second, ion transport is much faster 
in channels: Ions typically flow through channels at a 
rate of 107 to 108 per second, whereas pumps operate at 
speeds more than 10,000 times slower.
The Na+-K+ pump is a large membrane-spanning 
protein with catalytic binding sites for Na+ and ATP 
on its intracellular surface and for K+ on its extracellu-
lar surface. With each cycle, the pump hydrolyzes one 
molecule of ATP. (Because the Na+-K+ pump hydro-
lyzes ATP, it is also referred to as the Na+-K+ ATPase.) It 
uses this energy of hydrolysis to extrude three Na+ ions 
from the cell and bring in two K+ ions. The unequal 
flux of Na+ and K+ ions causes the pump to generate 
a net outward ionic current. Thus, the pump is said 
to be electrogenic. This pump-driven efflux of positive 
charge tends to set the resting potential a few millivolts 
more negative than would be achieved by the passive

Figure 9–4  The resting potential of a cell is determined by 
the proportions of different types of ion channels that are 
open, together with the value of their equilibrium poten-
tials. The channels in the figures represent the entire comple-
ment of K+ or Na+ channels in this hypothetical cell membrane. 
The lengths of the arrows within the channels represent the 
relative amplitudes of the electrical (red) and chemical (blue) 
driving forces acting on Na+ or K+. The lengths of the arrows 
in the diagram on the right denote the relative sizes of the net 
driving force (the sum of the electrical and chemical driving 
forces) for Na+ and K+ and the net ion currents. Three  
hypothetical situations are illustrated.
A. In a resting cell in which only K+ channels are present, K+ 
ions are in equilibrium and Vm = EK.
B. Adding a few Na+ channels to the resting membrane allows 
Na+ ions to diffuse into the cell, and this influx begins to depo-
larize the membrane.
C. The resting potential settles at a new level (Vr), where the 
influx of Na+ is balanced by the efflux of K+. In this example, the 
aggregate conductance of the K+ channels is much greater than 
that of the Na+ channels because the K+ channels are more 
numerous. As a result, a relatively small net driving force for K+ 
drives a current equal and opposite to the Na+ current driven by 
the much larger net driving force for Na+. This is a steady-state 
condition, in which neither Na+ nor K+ is in equilibrium but the 
net flux of charge is null.
D. Membrane voltage changes during the hypothetical situa-
tions illustrated in parts A, B, and C.
