Yuan et al. \n \n1.2 Molecular Architecture of NMDA Receptor Subtypes \nSimilar to AMPA and kainate receptors, NMDA receptor subunits share a common \nmembrane topology. Each subunit consists of a large extracellular amino terminal \ndomain, the bi-lobed agonist binding domain, three transmembrane domains (mem-\nbrane associated regions M1, M3, and M4), one cytoplasmic re-entrant pore loop \n(referred to as the P-region for pore forming region, or alternatively M2 for the sec-\nond membrane-associated domain), and an intracellular carboxyl terminal domain \n(Fig. 2). The ion channel pore region of NMDA receptors, which bears strong re-\nsemblance to an inverted potassium channel architecture, is composed of the re-\nentrant pore forming loop from all four subunits. Among NMDA receptor subunits, \nthe sequences of the pore region are highly conserved and this region determines \nbasic permeation properties. One of the key determinants of ion permeation for \nNMDA receptors resides at the apex of the re-entrant pore forming loop, which is \nsometimes referred to as the Q/R/N site on the basis of amino acid residues found at \nthis position in AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptors. This site partially defines the \nCa2+ permeability as well as the sensitivity to Mg2+. \n \nTwo modular semi-autonomous extracellular domains are thought to be encoded \nby each subunit. The amino terminal domain is composed of approximately the first \n350 amino acids of the protein and appears to form a clamshell-like structure, which \nshows sequence homology with bacterial leucine/isoleucine/valine binding domain \nas well as the glutamate binding site of the G-protein coupled receptor mGluR1. The \namino terminal domain interacts with various extracellular allosteric modulators such \nas zinc and polyamines, plays an important role in subunit assembly, and influences \ndeactivation (see below). This domain can also bind allosteric regulators such as \nifenprodil. Although no crystallographic structural information exists describing the \namino terminal domain, important insights have been derived from structural models \n(Fig. 2) (88, 109). \n \nThe glutamate and glycine binding domains are formed by two lobes referred to \nas D1 and D2, which are composed jointly of S1 (the polypeptide chain between \nthe amino terminal domain and the first transmembrane domain) and S2 (the ex-\ntracellular polypeptide chain between the second and third transmembrane do-\nmains) (see Fig. 2). The NR1 subunit binds glycine, whereas the NR2 subunit \nbinds glutamate. These regions fold into a hinged bi-lobed, clamshell-like structure \nthat contains the agonist binding site. This domain has been crystallized ((46, 47, \n56) see below), and shows sequence homology with bacterial periplasmic amino \nacid binding proteins such as the glutamine binding protein (QBP) and ly-\nsine/arginine/ornithnine-binding protein (LAOBP). The agonist binding site likely \nexists as a pair of NR1/NR2 heterodimers that form an extracellular portion of the \ntetramer (47)."}

Yuan et al. \n \n2 Structure and Function of Agonist Binding Domain \nWhile much has been learned about the structure and function of AMPA receptors in \nthe past 10 years, crystal structures of the glutamate binding domain of NMDA re-\nceptors have only recently been solved. The release of these structures has provided \na great deal of information about the agonist binding domains of NMDA receptors, \nand provided a means by which to interpret a large amount of mutagenesis work. A \nnumber of excellent reviews have summarized the structure-function relationship \nderived from this crystallographic data (22, 50, 67, 91, 94). \n2.1 Structural Features of the NR2 Glutamate Binding Site \nWhen the structure of the NR2A agonist binding domain in complex with the NR1 \nagonist binding domain was described (47), it provided the first experimental struc-\nture of the glutamate binding site of the NMDA receptor as well as the first structural \ninformation about the heterodimer interface within the NMDA receptor multimeric \ncomplex. The existence of this interface between NR1 and NR2 provides a possible \nstructural explanation for allosteric interactions observed between glutamate and \nglycine. This allosteric interaction is shown by NR2 control of glycine potency at \nNR1 (98) as well as glycine-dependent desensitization (see below). The agonist \nglutamate binds in the cleft between the two clearly defined lobes (D1 and D2) of the \nagonist binding domain, near the hinge region (Fig. 2). The lower half of the binding \npocket is formed largely by the ends of helix F and helix I. Residues from loops \nwithin the upper lobe (D1) form most of the upper half of the binding pocket, al-\nthough an arginine (Arg499 in NR2A) is located on a more distant helix with the \nlength of its side chain allowing it to reach the ligand. The pocket is largely lined with \npolar amino acid side chains, although some aromatic character is provided by a his-\ntidine (His466 in NR2A) and two tyrosines (Tyr711 and Tyr742 in NR2A) (Fig. 2). \nVirtually all of the contact residues in NR2A are analogous to contact residues in \n  \n \nFig. 2.

Despite being tucked away between the \nlobes, the binding site is fairly accessible to water, with 6 water oxygens found within \n4 Å of the NR2A-bound glutamate. Two of these waters form hydrogen bonds with \nbound glutamate, one with the amino group and one with the γ-carboxyl group (47). \n \nIn addition to this contact with water, the γ-carboxyl group of the glutamate ago-\nnist also makes hydrogen bond contact to the side chain and backbone amide of a \nthreonine (Thr671 in NR2A) (Fig. 2). The amino group of glutamate forms hydrogen \nbonds with the backbone carbonyl of a serine (Ser492 in NR2A), the side chain of a \nthreonine (Thr494 in NR2A), and the previously mentioned water molecule. In \nNR2A, the α-carboxyl group of glutamate forms a bifurcated salt bridge with \nArg499, as well as hydrogen bonds with the amide backbones of both Ser670 and \nThr494. \n2.2 Determinants of Glutamate Binding and Function  \nwithin the NR2 Subunit \nPrior to the crystallographic data, many residues were suggested to influence gluta-\nmate binding on the basis of mutagenesis studies (summarized in (22, 32)). For ex-\nample, Anson et al. (3) probed the glutamate binding site of NR2A using site-\ndirected mutagenesis. Three of ten mutations (H466A, G669A, and T671A) were \nfound to increase the EC50 of glutamate by over 100-fold, with the effect of the \nNR2A(T671A) mutation increasing EC50 over 1000-fold. His466 and Tyr671 contact \nglutamate in the crystallographic structure and Gly669 is proximal to glutamate and \nmutation of Gly669 likely disturbs the structure of the binding pocket. More re-\ncently, effects of mutations at agonist contact residues were examined for several \ndifferent agonists and partial agonists of NR2A (21). \n \nAlthough only structural information for the NR2A agonist binding domain ex-\nists, investigations on other NR2 subtypes have resulted in important data about the \nfunction of these. Recent studies have examined the effects of mutants in the agonist \nbinding site of NR2B, and suggested structural roles for several of these mutants on \nthe basis of changes in potency and efficacy of glutamate and several other ligands \n(31, 50, 78). A molecular dynamics study of NR1/NR2A and a homology model for \nNR1/NR2D ligand binding domains showed similar contact residues in the NR2A \nand NR2D glutamate binding pockets, with the exception of Tyr711 (Tyr732 in \nNR2D), which forms an inter-domain bridge in NR2A and a direct ligand contact in \nNR2D (42). These similar contacts occurred although simulations showed differ-\nences between NR2A and NR2D in the placement of the D2 region, specifically in \nhelix F. Mutagenesis studies support the proposed difference in the NR2D pocket, \nand also predict that a number of additional inter-domain hydrogen bonds in NR2D \nenhance the affinity of that subunit for glutamate. Interestingly, 4-methyl glutamate \ncan distinguish between the NR2A and NR2D binding pockets, with the methyl \ngroup clashing with Tyr711 in NR2A because of its position as an inter-domain con-\ntact. However, the corresponding residue in NR2D (Tyr732) bends out of the way as it \nmakes contact with the agonist, creating space for the 4-methyl group. This leads to a \n50-fold increase in potency of (2S,4R)-4-methyl glutamate (SYM2081; (42)) for NR2D \nover NR2A."}
{"text": "===== Page 8 =====\n296 \nH. Yuan et al. \n \n2.3 Structural Features of the NR1 Glycine Binding Site \nGlycine was first found to potentiate NMDA receptors, and later argued to be a \nrequired co-agonist for NMDA receptor activation (60, 70, 81). Mutagenesis stud-\nies provided the initial evidence that the NR1 subunit harbors the glycine binding \nsite (77, 145, 150), which was subsequently confirmed when structures of the NR1 \nagonist binding domain were solved by Furukawa and Gouaux (46). The binding \npocket for the co-agonist glycine in NR1 is situated similarly within the agonist \nbinding domain as the glutamate pocket was in NR2, primarily formed by residues \nat the end of two D2 helices and loops from D1. The pocket is smaller and more \nhydrophobic than that found in NR2A, with Phe484, Trp731, and Phe758 replacing \nthe three more hydrophilic aromatic residues in NR2A (His466, Tyr711, and \nTyr742) (Fig. 2). Furthermore, Thr671 in NR2A is replaced by a valine in NR1 \n(Val689). The hydrophobic Val689 and the larger hydrophobic residues Phe484, \nTrp731, and Phe758 likely occlude binding of glutamate to NR1. Glycine binds \ndeeper between the two lobes, and is less exposed to water than glutamate in \nNR2A. The amino group of glycine forms hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl back-\nbone of Pro516 and the side chains of Thr518 and Asp732. The alpha-carboxyl of \nglycine forms a similar hydrogen bonding interaction as seen with glutamate, a \nbifurcated salt bridge with Arg523, and interactions with the backbone amides of \nThr518 and Ser688. Structures are also available for the endogenous agonist D-\nserine, which shows additional interactions between the hydroxyl of D-serine and \nresidues Thr518 and Ser688. \n \nA pair of cysteine residues within the NR1 subunit are conserved across the \nglutamate receptor family (NR1 Cys744 and Cys798), and have been proposed to \nform a site that is sensitive to redox potential (1, 133). These two residues are \noxidized in the crystal structure, and the resulting disulfide bond imparts some \nconformational constraints on the receptor. Mutagenesis studies suggest that relief \nof this constraint in NR1 (but not NR2) by reduction of the Cys744-Cys798 disul-\nfide bond enhances receptor function (133), apparently by increasing channel \nopening frequency with little effect on single channel conductance or channel open \ntime (135). Interestingly, NR1(C744A) and NR1(C798A) mutations enhance the \npotency of NMDA acting at the NR2 subunit by an unknown mechanism (133). \nSeveral other disulfide bonds exist within the crystallized NR1 and NR2A sub-\nunits, although functional effects of their reduction or oxidation have not yet been \ndescribed (46, 47). \n2.4 Determinants of Glycine Binding and Function  \nwithin the NR1 Subunit \nMultiple ligands have each been crystallized in the NR1 agonist binding domain (46, \n47, 56), providing a structural basis for understanding the effects of partial agonists, \nagonists, and antagonists. Similar to previous structures of related glutamate receptors \nas described in the chapter by Mayer, the antagonist 5,7-dichlorokynurenate stabilizes \nan open-cleft conformation of the NR1 agonist binding domain, resulting in a loss of \n24 degrees of domain closure when compared to the glycine-bound structure.

However, despite this similarity, the structure of NR1 bound by partial \nagonists was unlike that observed for AMPA and kainate receptors. While previous \nstructures of AMPA receptor glutamate binding domains showed partial domain \nclosure that correlated with the efficacy of the partial agonist (e.g. (58)), no such \nrelationship was seen in the NR1 agonist binding domain. Multiple structures \nshowed that the partial agonists D-cycloserine, ACPC, and ACBC bound with virtu-\nally identical degrees of domain closure of NR1 compared to the glycine complex. \nBy contrast, a more subtle effect is revealed in the incremental shift in the position of \nhelix F and the hinge region between the two lobes of the clamshell structure (56, \n71). These and other data (see (71) suggest that the position of helix F may influence \nefficacy, or perhaps may be involved in translating the effects of agonist binding to \ngating. \n \nInterestingly, the heterodimer interface between NR1 and NR2A may also impact \nreceptor function. Three separate areas of contact between NR1 and NR2A were \nidentified from the dimer crystal structure (47). Mutagenesis in the two outer regions \n(sites I and III) was shown to influence dimerization of the soluble agonist binding \ndomains of NR1 and NR2A. Modification of site II, which is analogous to a binding \nsite for small ligands that modulate deactivation in AMPA receptors (59, 96, 107), \nimpacts deactivation with different mutants of Tyr535 in NR1 capable of increasing \nor decreasing the rate of deactivation. These results suggest domain interface stabil-\nity can control NMDA receptor function, similar to what has been found for AMPA \nand kainate receptors as discussed in the chapter by Mayer. \n2.5 Agonist Binding to the NR3 Subunit \nSeveral groups simultaneously isolated cDNAs that encoded proteins with similarity \nto the NMDA receptor subunits NR1 and NR2 (27, 132). The two subunits compris-\ning this new subfamily (NR3A and NR3B) appear to co-assemble with the NR1 \nsubunit alone to produce glycine-activated excitatory currents (16). In addition, the \nNR3 subunit can also co-assemble with the NR1 and NR2 subunits as heterotrimeric \nreceptors. NMDA receptors containing the NR3 subunit show reduced Ca2+ perme-\nability, reduced sensitivity to voltage dependent block by extracellular Mg2+, and \nreduced single channel conductance (16, 27, 90, 102, 108, 120, 132). A soluble \nNR3A agonist binding domain has been purified, which shows high affinity for gly-\ncine (40 nM) and pharmacology distinct from the NR1 subunit (157). The NR3A \nsubunit also binds D-serine with lower affinity than glycine. Interestingly, glycine \nbinding to the NR1 subunit appears to play an auto-inhibitory role in NR1/NR3A \nheterodimers, since NR1-selective antagonists can enhance glycine-evoked current \n(87). This suggests a strikingly different role of the NR1 subunit in NR1/NR3 recep-\ntors compared to NR1/NR2 receptors, which require glycine binding to NR1 for \nactivation."}

Yuan et al. \n \nand Channel Block \n3.1 Receptor Gating \nNMDA receptor activation is a complex series of events that start with agonist bind-\npore, block and unblock by Mg2+, and cation permeation. The structural basis of the \nmechanisms that control the opening and closing of the channel are not fully under-\nstood. The activation of NMDA receptors requires the binding of glutamate and \nglycine to the receptor. Although the structure of the apo form of the NR1 or NR2A \nagonist binding domain has not been described, we will assume NMDA receptors \ngenerally bind glutamate as AMPA or kainate receptors do. In this scenario, the \ninitial interactions of glutamate with its binding site are associated with a rapid rear-\nrangement of the agonist binding domain that involves closure of the angle between \nthe two lobes that comprise the clamshell binding site. This leads to association of \nthe γ-carboxyl of glutamate with the lower portion of the bi-lobed binding site, and \nthe ultimate formation of intra-lobe hydrogen bonds. The resulting energy associated \nwith closure of the clamshell structure is conveyed through long range intra-protein \ninteractions to cause the structure of the channel to undergo a conformational change \nthat opens a permeation pore. There is as yet insufficient structural or functional data \n \nSite-directed mutagenesis studies show that all three transmembrane domains \n(M1, M3, and M4) as well as the reentrant pore forming loop are involved in the \ngating. Among these regions, the second transmembrane domain is thought to be an \nimportant component of channel gating, since activation of the channel causes this \ndomain to move. Within this domain, there is a highly conserved nine amino acids \nmotif (SYTANLAAF). Site-directed mutagenesis of residues on this motif signifi-\ncantly alters the channel function (8, 62, 85). The NMDA receptor second trans-\nmembrane domain is presumably a rigid helix that physically contacts the reentrant \ndomain of both subunits moves during the gating, which directly results in the \nmovement of the pore forming loop, and in turn, the channel pore. The narrowest \nconstriction within the channel pore, which consists of the reentrant loop tip, might \nthus control opening or closing of the pore. \n \nThe first widely accepted kinetic model for NMDA receptor activation was pro-\nposed by Lester and Jahr (82) (Fig. 3a).

To overcome these limitations, newer models, which incorpo-\nrate both glutamate and glycine binding steps, have been proposed (11, 83, 100). \n \nA key feature of several recently published conceptual models of function that \nprovide a better description of single channel data is the incorporation of multiple \nsteps between binding and gating (7, 41, 112, 114, 123). A recent study of single \nchannel and macroscopic responses to full and partial agonists on recombinant \nNR1/NR2B receptors (7) suggested that agonist binding to different subunits in some \nfashion controls different steps in the receptor activation scheme, suggesting a work-\ning hypothesis that the binding of glutamate and glycine on separate subunits con-\ntrols different, perhaps subunit specific, conformational changes that are required for \nchannel opening (Fig. 3b). These conformational changes are hypothesized to occur \nin either order to arrive at an intermediate state that is then followed by channel \nopening. Similar models have been proposed by Schorge et al. (123) and Auerbach \nand Zhou (4). A number of additional models (39, 113) can also account for micro-\nscopic and macroscopic properties by incorporating multiple gating steps in a linear \nreaction scheme in which a specific sequence of transitions is implicit in the reaction \nmechanism. An important point made by all of these studies is that faithful represen-\ntation of single channel data as well as macroscopic responses requires multiple pre-\ngating steps as well as multiple open states (Fig. 3c). \n3.2 Structural Determinants of Ion Permeation \nThe channel pore of NMDA receptors consists of an outer extracellular vestibule, an \ninner intracellular vestibule and a narrow constriction, which likely lies just past the \nmidpoint traversing the membrane from extra- to intracellular. The extracellular \nvestibule is formed by the residues on the N-terminal side of the first transmembrane \ndomain segment, the C-terminal portion of the second transmembrane domain, and \nthe N-terminal portion of the third transmembrane domain of both NR1 and NR2 \nsubunits. In NR1/NR2 receptors, both NR1 and NR2 subunits contribute to the ex-\ntracellular vestibule; the contribution of NR1 and NR2 may be staggered by one \nhelical turn in the vertical axis perpendicular to the plane of the membrane (130). \nThe second transmembrane domain of NR1 and NR2 appears to be the only trans-\nmembrane helix that contributes to the deep voltage-dependent portion of the vesti-\nbule (129). The re-entrant pore-forming loop lines an intracellular vestibule with the \ntip of the loop forming the narrowest constriction of the channel. Both extracellular \nand intracellular vestibules are thought to be water-filled (8, 76). The narrow con-\nstriction, which may act as a molecular sieve, is referred to as the selectivity filter, \nand is typically a major determinant of ion selectivity in channels. By using the rela-\ntive permeability of differently sized organic cations as an indicator of the dimension \nof the narrow constriction, the cross-sectional diameter of the narrow constriction of \nwild type recombinant NR1/NR2A receptor was suggested to be approximately 0.55 \nnm (142). \n \nAn accumulating body of evidence suggests that ionotropic glutamate receptors \nand potassium channels share a common architecture in their transmembrane pores. \nSequence comparison, topology profiling, and analogy to a bacterial glutamate-\nto this model, such as the disregard of the glycine binding steps, which are important"}
{"text": "===== Page 13 =====\nStructure and Function of the NMDA Receptor\n301\n \n \n \nactivated receptor with a potassium-selective channel pore (92) provides compelling \nevidence for structural similarity between glutamate receptors and potassium chan-\nnels. The primary differences in the pore-forming region between potassium chan-\nnels and glutamate receptors is the orientation of the pore loop relative to the mem-\nbrane as well as the lack of a selectivity filter for NMDA receptors; NMDA \nreceptors are permeable to Na+, K+, Ca2+, whereas potassium channels are selectively \nface the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, whereas both ends in potassium channels \nsuch as KcsA face the extracellular side. The structures of the KcsA and MthK chan-\nnels have created a template for understanding glutamate receptor transmembane \nstructure (33, 57). \n \nOne feature that distinguishes NMDA receptors from other ligand gated channels \nis their unique subconductance levels and permeability to Ca2+. Multi-sublevel con-\nductance of NMDA receptors has been observed not only on recombinant NMDA \nreceptors, but also in native neurons. The unitary conductance roughly correlates \nwith Ca2+ permeability among NMDA receptors containing different NR2 subunits. \nIn contrast to studies of AMPA receptors (117, 128), the frequency of subconduc-\ntance level transitions in NMDA receptors are concentration-independent. The chan-\nnel of NMDA receptors is more selective for Ca2+ than for monovalent ions such as \nNa+ and K+. The NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx not only alters intracellular \nCa2+ concentration, but also triggers many biological functions, such as changes in \nsynaptic efficacy, gene expression, development of synaptic connections, as well as \npathological processes. A number of lines of investigation suggest that the apex of \nthe reentrant pore forming loop reaches towards the extracellular vestibule and forms \nthe narrow region, which contributes to the ion selectivity (153). Several residues \nthat determine the ion permeability have been identified (15, 55, 66, 126). The same \nasparagine residue in the pore forming reentrant loop of both NR1 and NR2 subunits \nthat plays a key role in Mg2+ block also is involved in the Ca2+ permeation (15). This \nresidue is analogous to the Q/R-site in AMPA receptors, which also controls Ca2+ \npermeation. \n3.3 Structural Determinants of Channel Block \nOne unique feature of NMDA receptors is their voltage-dependent channel block by \nextracellular Mg2+. Both native and recombinant NMDA receptors show a strong \nvoltage-dependent block by physiological concentrations of Mg2+, which acts to \nprevent influx of Ca2+ and monovalent cations. This Mg2+ blockade is relieved by the \ndepolarization of the membrane potential, providing the receptor with the ability to \ndetect coincident release of glutamate and postsynaptic membrane depolarization. If \nthe membrane potential is sufficiently depolarized to relieve voltage-dependent \nchannel block by extracellular Mg2+ at the time NMDA receptors bind glutamate and \nglycine, the channel will open and allow ion permeation that can lead to a significant \ninflux of Ca2+. This in turn will trigger a series of intracellular events under both \nphysiological and pathophysiological conditions that can alter the strength of synap-\ntic signaling.

In addition, NR2A- and NR2B-containing receptors exhibit a \nslower component of Mg2+ unblock than NR2C- and NR2D-containing receptors \n(29). \n \nAlthough the structural determinants of Mg2+ block are becoming clearer, more \ninformation is still needed before a specific model of Mg2+ block at atomic resolution \ncan be proposed. An N-site asparagine has been located as a key determinant of \nMg2+ block. Several mutagenesis studies suggest that channels containing amino acid \nsubstitutions at the N-site or adjacent asparagines in the NR2A subunit show an \nincreased Mg2+ permeability, suggesting that these adjacent asparagine residues form \na barrier for inward Mg2+ influx (152). Other than the N-site asparagines, several \nadditional regions for blockade by Mg2+ have been identified. Studies of chimeric \nreceptors suggest that multiple structural elements control the NR2 subunit specific-\nity of Mg2+ block, including the first transmembrane domain, the small linker con-\nnecting pore forming reentrant loop and the second transmembrane domain, and the \nthird transmembrane domain (74). \n \nBesides external Mg2+, a number of other rigid organic cations of diverse chemi-\ncal structures are capable of blocking the NMDA pore when the channel opens. Most \nof these compounds are positively charged at physiological pH and function as un-\ncompetitive inhibitors. A defining property of these channel blockers is that they \nbind to and block agonist-gated open channels more rapidly than the closed channels, \na feature termed use-dependence. Based on the difference in the interaction with the \nchannel gate, the open channel blockers are further classified into three categories: \n(1) trapping blockers, such as MK-801, phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine, which \nunbinds; (2) “sequential” or “foot-in-the-door” blockers, such as aminoacridine de-\nrivatives and tetraetylammonium (TEA), which bind to the channel only when it is \nopen and prevent channel closure; (3) partial trapping blockers, such as memantine \n \nNumerous studies show that NMDA channel blockers are neuroprotective in \nanimal models of neurological disorders that involve excessive stimulation of the \nNMDA receptors, such as traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, stroke, neuropathic pain, \nas well as neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson’s \ndisease and Huntington’s disease. However, clinical trials have largely been disap-\npointing, as dose-limiting side effects and a narrow temporal window for interven-\ntion have likely confounded interpretation and derailed positive results. Interestingly, \nlow affinity channel blockers are well tolerated, and memantine, which shows fast \nblocking/unblocking kinetics, has been approved for clinical use in the United States \nfor treating Alzheimer’s disease (84). With more attention to subunit selectivity, \nrapid block and unblock kinetics, additional channel blockers may show promise as \nclinically useful agents. \n \nare trapped inside the pore as the channel returns to the closed state and the agonist \nand amantadine, which exhibit intermediate properties between above two categories, \nimpede the channel closure without completely preventing it."}
{"text": "===== Page 15 =====\nStructure and Function of the NMDA Receptor\n303\n \n \n \n4 Regulation of NMDA Receptor Function \nNMDA receptors are regulated by phosphorylation, extracellular ions, and intracellu-\nlar binding proteins. We will focus primarily on regulation of NMDA receptor func-\ntion by extracellular ions and molecules, with particular attention given to mecha-\nnisms for which structural information exists. \n4.1 Desensitization of NMDA Receptors \nDesensitization is operational defined as a decrement in receptor response in the \ncontinued presence of a stimulus. Native and recombinant NMDA receptors desensi-\ntize by several different mechanisms, including glycine-dependent desensitization, \nZn2+-dependent desensitization, Ca2+ dependent desensitization, and glycine/Ca2+/ \nZn2+-independent desensitization. We will consider each in turn. \n \nMayer and colleagues (93) were the first to describe an apparent desensitization \nof neuronal NMDA receptors in the presence of sub-saturating glycine concentration, \nwhich abated with increases in the concentration of extracellular glycine. They pos-\ntulated that a negative allosteric interaction occurred between the glutamate- and \nglycine binding domains such that the binding of glutamate decreased the affinity for \nglycine (10, 83). The idea embodied in this working hypothesis was simple—when \nglutamate binds, the affinity for the glycine binding site becomes lower, and in the \nabsence of high concentrations of glycine, the current diminishes with the relaxation \nto a new equilibrium as glycine unbinds from the receptor. Since glycine is a re-\nquired co-agonist of the NMDA receptor, sub-saturating concentrations of glycine \nresults in a desensitization of the current. The time course for the desensitization thus \nreflects the unbinding of glycine from the receptor, and is within the range of synap-\ntic NMDA receptor time course, suggesting it could impact synaptic signaling. While \nthis mechanism was proposed purely from functional data, subsequent structural \nstudies (47) showed that the glycine binding domain of the NR1 subunit crystallizes \nas a heterodimer with the glutamate binding domain of NR2, providing a plausible \nstructural model for negative allosteric coupling between the glutamate and glycine \nbinding sites. \n \nExtracellular Zn2+ has long been known to inhibit neuronal NMDA receptors \n(110, 146). A number of investigators have reported high affinity regulation of \nNR2A-containing recombinant NMDA receptors by nanomolar concentrations of \nextracellular Zn2+ (20, 104, 137, 150). However, Raymond and colleagues observed \nthe appearance of a rapid component of desensitization in the presence of extracellu-\nlar Zn2+, and postulated that Zn2+ accelerated receptor desensitization (20). Subse-\nquent work showed that Zn2+-induced desensitization occurred by a similar mecha-\nnism as glycine-dependent desensitization. Zheng et al. (159) proposed that a \npositive allosteric intra-subunit interaction exists between the glutamate binding \ndomain and the Zn2+ binding domain, which likely resides in the NR2A amino ter-\nminal domain (26, 45, 86, 106). The working hypothesis, supported by a range of \nexperimentation, suggests that binding of glutamate enhances Zn2+ binding, such that \nin the presence of subsaturating concentrations of Zn2+, the system relaxes to a new \nequilibrium with Zn2+ binding to the receptor in a concentration-dependent fashion."}
{"text": "===== Page 16 =====\n304 \nH. Yuan et al. \n \nThus, the desensitization time course reflects the time course for Zn2+ binding to the \nreceptors following a shift of the Zn2+ binding site into a high affinity state (42). \n \nNMDA receptors additionally undergo a Ca2+-dependent inhibition that is propor-\ntional to the magnitude of the current, and is often referred to as Ca2+ dependent \ndesensitization or inactivation (28, 80, 116, 143). Ca2+-dependent desensitization \ndevelops slowly over seconds, and can be blocked by introduction of Ca2+ chelators \ninto the cell. The magnitude of Ca2+-dependent desensitization varies among NR2 \nsubunits, being more prominent for NR2A than for NR2D, and absent for NR2B and \nNR2C receptors (72, 95). The working hypothesis underlying this form of regulation \nis that an increase in the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ occurs in the immediate \nvicinity of the intracellular portion of the channel, and this increased Ca2+ inhibits the \nreceptor by stimulating the uncoupling of the receptor from filamentous actin in a \nmanner sensitive to second messenger systems (118). Additional data suggest a role \nfor calmodulin binding to the NR1 subunit of the receptor in this form of desensitiza-\ntion. NR1 splice variants can remove one of a pair of calmodulin binding sites from \nthe receptor and abolish Ca2+-dependent desensitization (37, 38). Furthermore, muta-\ntions within one of these NR1 calmodulin binding sites disrupt Ca2+-dependent de-\nsensitization (73, 158). Interestingly, alpha-actinin2 binds to the intracellular C-\nterminal of the NR1 subunit in a manner that is antagonized by calmodulin (2, 156), \nsuggesting alpha-actinin2 may be involved in Ca2+-dependent desensitization. \n \nA wide range of ligand-gated channels undergo a form of desensitization that \nappears to reflect conformational changes within the receptor. Independent of the \nforms of desensitization discussed above, the NMDA receptor can additional desen-\nsitize in the continued presence of agonist by a mechanism that is independent of \nCa2+, Zn2+ and glycine; such desensitization is more prominent in excised outside-out \nmembrane patches, suggesting a regulation by a diffusible factor (121, 122). This \nform of desensitization can be reduced by mutations both in the conserved \nSYTANLAAF motif in the second transmembrane domain and deep within the \nchannel pore, suggesting that it may be coupled to the gating mechanism (19, 53). \nInterestingly, glycine and Ca2+-independent desensitization of certain subunits are \nalso controlled by the presence of CamKII, which accelerates the rate of desensitiza-\n(125). \n4.2 Allosteric Regulation of NMDA Receptor Function by Protons \nsensitivity (reviewed by (136)), NMDA receptors appeared somewhat unique in that \nprotons potently (IC50 50 nM) and completely inhibited receptor function with a \nconcentration-effect relationship that approximately followed a single binding site \nisotherm. These reports suggested that neuronal NMDA receptors are tonically inhib-\nited by physiological concentrations of protons with an IC50 value that corresponds \nto about pH 7.4, or approximately 50 nM protons. Proton inhibition depends on \nalternative RNA splicing of the NR1 subunit and the identity of the NR2 subunit \n(140). Under physiological conditions, the NMDA receptor resides under tonic inhi-\ntion of NR1/NR2B, but slows the rate of desensitization of NR1/NR2A receptors \nA number of studies have described inhibition of NMDA receptors by extracellular \nprotons (49, 134, 139, 144). Although virtually all receptors show some form of pH"}

At the single channel level, protons appear to reduce open prob-\nability for NR1/NR2B recombinant receptors, with only modest effects on the open \ntime and no effects on single channel conductance (6, 138). Mutagenesis data, while \nnot implicating any single residue as causative for proton inhibition, shows a cluster-\ning of residues at which mutagenesis alters pH sensitivity that is near the linkers \ncoupling the agonist binding domain to the transmembrane helices (85). Interest-\ningly, inward rectifier potassium channels, which share a number of common fea-\ntures with the glutamate receptor family (75), are also pH sensitive (e.g. (124)), rais-\ning the possibility that the two channels share some structural determinants or \nmechanisms of proton inhibition. \n \nSeveral recent studies suggest that the downstream effects of a number of modu-\nlators may reflect a subtle change in the pKa of the proton sensor that either en-\nhances or reduces tonic proton inhibition at physiological pH; enhancement of proton \nsensitivity will appear as inhibition, whereas a reduction in sensitivity to protons \nappears as a potentiation. For example, regulation of NMDA receptor function by \nextracellular polyamines such as spermine (61, 148) occurs in a subunit-dependent \nfashion, with only the NR2B subunit showing potentiation by 100’s of micromolar \nspermine (35, 36). The potentiation by polyamines only occurs at pH values that \nproduce tonic inhibition, suggesting that the binding of polyamines such as spermine \nshifts the pKa of the proton sensor to reduce tonic inhibition. Consistent with this \nidea, spermine can shift the experimentally-determined proton inhibition curve, and \nthere is a strong correlation between the degree of proton inhibition and the degree of \nspermine potentiation, consistent with a relief of proton inhibition by polyamines \n(140). There is also a strong correlation between the ability of various mutations to \nshift the proton sensitivity and their effects on polyamine potentiation (64, 65, 89, \n140, 151). These data all suggest that the full potentiating effect of polyamine bind-\ning (in the presence of saturating glutamate and glycine) can be accounted for by \nrelief of tonic proton inhibition. This finding created two important precedents. First, \nthis conclusion (spermine relieves proton inhibition by shifting the pKa of a proton \nsensor; (140)) established the idea that exogenous molecules could regulate NMDA \nreceptor function through actions on the proton sensor. Second, implicit in this straight-\nforward mechanism is the idea that agents that enhance or diminish proton sensitivity \ncan cause inhibition and potentiation of NMDA receptor function, respectively. \n4.3 Allosteric Regulation of NMDA Receptor Function  \nThe isolation of cDNA’s encoding the NMDA receptor subunits in the 1990’s pro-\nvided an opportunity to pursue a molecular understanding of Zn2+ inhibition. One of \nthe first observations made was that the NR2A subunit was exquisitely sensitive to \nchanges with neuronal activity (24). Changes in pH driven by pathological situations, \nsuch as seizure or ischemia, are also more than sufficient to inhibit NMDA receptor \nby Extracellular Zn2+"}
{"text": "===== Page 18 =====\n306 \nH. Yuan et al. \n \nextracellular Zn2+, with variable IC50 values reported in the nM range (e.g. (20, \n147)). Paoletti et al. (104) used buffered Zn2+ to unambiguously determine the IC50 \nvalue for the high affinity Zn2+ site, and further showed that hundreds of nanomolar \nZn2+ often persists as a contaminant of physiological saline solutions made from \ncommercially available salts. One interesting feature to emerge from these studies is \nthat Zn2+ inhibition curves for NR1/NR2A receptors are biphasic. The interpretation \nof this was that saturating concentrations of Zn2+ at the nM high affinity site do not \nimpart full inhibition, which could only be observed at higher concentrations of Zn2+ \n(10’s of micromolar), which cause a voltage-dependent channel block. Studies of \nchimeric NR2A-NR2C receptors suggested that the amino terminal domain of NR2A \ncontrolled the high affinity Zn2+ site (45). Site-directed mutagenesis further isolated a \nseries of histidine residues that were candidates for chelating Zn2+ within its binding \nsite (26, 45, 86). The amino terminal domain harboring the Zn2+ site shows a number \nof similarities to both bacterial periplasmic amino acid binding proteins as well as \nthe glutamate binding site of mGluR1, allowing structural models of amino terminal \ndomain to be developed (105). These models and supporting experimentation show \nconvincingly that the amino terminal domain folds into a bi-lobed clamshell struc-\nture, with the Zn2+ binding site residing within the cleft. \n \nFollowing work on ifenprodil ((99), see below) and spermine control of NMDA \nreceptor proton sensitivity of receptors (140), Choi and Lipton (26) proposed that the \nbinding of extracellular Zn2+ to the amino terminal domain enhances the sensitivity \nof the NR1/NR2A receptor to protons. The leftward shift of the proton inhibition \ncurve for Zn2+-bound receptors means that at pH 7.4, the extent of inhibition by \nprotons increases from 50% to perhaps 80%. The result of this is an apparent Zn2+-\ninduced inhibition that reflects an increase in the proportion of protonated and non-\nfunctional receptors. A number of lines of evidence support this hypothesis. At alka-\nline pH values where the proton inhibition is absent, Zn2+ causes no inhibition.  \nFurthermore, the close functional interactions of Zn2+ binding and proton inhibition \nimplies a strong correlation between the ability of mutations to shift the proton sensi-\ntivity and their effects on the Zn2+ inhibition (86). Lastly, kinetic modeling of Zn2+-\ninduced enhancement of proton inhibition can quantitatively account for the actions \nof Zn2+on proton binding rates, providing additional support to this hypothesis (43). \n \nZn2+ inhibits the NR2B-containing NMDA receptors with an IC50 value near 1 \nmicromolar. Rachline et al. (115) have recently extended the structural hypothesis \ndeveloped for Zn2+ inhibition at NR2A to the NR2B subunit. Their ideas are consis-\ntent with functional model of inhibition originally proposed by Choi & Lipton (26) \nfor Zn2+ inhibition of both NR2A and NR2B containing receptors. This idea is also \nconsistent with mutagenesis studies showing similar sensitivity to mutations of Zn2+ \nand proton IC50 values (137). Interestingly, the high affinity Zn2+site is partially \nmaintained in heterotrimeric NR1/NR2A/NR2B receptors, but shows shallower \ninhibition (51). \n4.4 NR2B Selective Allosteric Modulators \nThe phenylethanolamine ifenprodil was the first subunit-selective antagonist identi-\nfied at any NMDA receptor subunit (149).

Most data support the idea that ifenprodil binds to the \namino terminal domain of an NR2B subunit in a fashion analogous to Zn2+ binding \nto NR2A (14, 48, 109, 154), although residues in the NR1 amino terminal domain \nalso have important effects on ifenprodil binding (89). Molecular modeling studies \nsupport an intra-cleft binding site within the NR2B bi-lobed amino terminal domain \n(54, 88, 109), analogous to that proposed for Zn2+ binding to the NR2A amino termi-\nnal domain. In addition, ifenprodil and its analogues exert a range of actions includ-\ning a positive allosteric enhancement of submaximal glutamate responses (68, 69). \nAt higher concentrations, ifenprodil induces a non-competitive, voltage-independent \ninhibition of NR1/NR2B receptors that is incomplete. Extensive studies of the \nmechanism suggest ifenprodil promotes entry of the receptor into a long-lived shut \nstate that is analogous to desensitization (68, 69). A large number of structural \nclasses of NR2B-selective ligands have been described, which show a surprising \ndegree of diversity in structure (12, 17, 23, 79). \n \nMott et al. (99) have proposed that ifenprodil binding causes a unique action on \nthe proton sensor, which enhances the proton sensitivity of the receptor. Evaluation \nof the proton inhibition curve in the absence and presence of ifenprodil shows a \nleftward shift, with ifenprodil enhancing proton inhibition of receptor function at all \npH values except alkaline levels. This enhancement of proton sensitivity increases \nthe level of tonic inhibition at physiological pH, which appears as inhibition. The \npotency of ifenprodil is pH sensitive, and there is a strong correlation with the po-\ntency shift induced in ifenprodil and proton sensitivity by a series of mutants (99, \n103). Perhaps the strongest evidence supporting the idea of enhancement of proton \nsensitivity by ifenprodil comes from experiments at alkaline pH values where there \nis little proton inhibition; under this condition there is no effect of ifenprodil even \nthough it remains bound to the receptor. These data provide a link between mecha-\nnisms of regulation by ligands of the amino terminal domain, and also suggest that \nthe tight regulation of gating by protons could be a downstream substrate for several \nregulatory pathways. \n5 Conclusions \nThe remarkable advances in our understanding of all features of the NMDA recep-\ntors suggest that their modular receptor design impacts function and regulation. That \nis, autonomous domains have clear and distinct effects on receptor function. It is also \nclear that key features of receptor structure are conserved across the glutamate recep-\ntor family, although different subunit families appear to have perhaps somewhat \ndifferent mechanisms of activation and desensitization. What seems clear is that the \nfirst steps of channel activation are similar between AMPA, kainate and NMDA \nreceptors, which all presumably undergo agonist-induced domain closure.

Petralia \nLaboratory of Neurochemistry, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication \nAbstract. NMDA receptors (NMDARs) play a distinct role at excitatory glutamatergic syn-\napses, where they are usually localized with other ionotropic glutamate receptors, including \ntors. Two features are essential to their specialized roles in synaptic plasticity and the excito-\ndependent magnesium block, the removal of which requires depolarization of the membrane \npotential. Second, upon activation, the NMDAR channel passes sodium and, importantly, \ncalcium into the neuron. Calcium is the universal second messenger in numerous intracellular \nsignaling cascades and is critical in synaptic plasticity and mechanisms of neurotoxicity (288). \n1 NMDAR Structure and Subunits \nThe functional NMDAR is a tetrameric protein complex with subunits comprised of \nthree gene families: NR1, NR2, and NR3. All NMDAR subunits have similar mem-\nbrane topology: an extracellular amino-terminal domain (ATD), 3 transmembrane \ndomains (TM1, 3, 4), a re-entrant P loop at TM2 that lines the pore of the channel, \nand an intracellular C-terminal tail. The ATD is implicated in subunit assembly (210, \n213) and in receptor sensitivity to modulators such as protons, polyamines, Zn2+, and \nifenprodil (76, 198, 256) (for review, see (122)). The extracellular S1 (N-terminal) \nand S2 (between TM3 and TM4) regions comprise the glycine-binding domains of \nNR1 (124, 162, 350) and NR3 (10, 40), and the glutamate-binding domains of the \nNR2 subunits (172, 318). The intracellular C-terminal tail, the sequence and length \nof which varies considerably among the different subunits, interacts with numerous \nbinding partners (252, 364) and contains multiple phosphorylation sites (145, 283, \n364). \n \nNR1 subunits contain three alternatively spliced exons- one near the N-terminus \n(N1; exon 5) and two in the C-terminal tail (C1 and C2/C2’; exons 21 and 22). Thus, \nthere are eight different splice forms, seven of which have been identified in vivo \n(174), that exhibit distinct regional distributions over development (175, 269, 392). \nDisorders, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA, wenthold@nidcd.nih.gov \n \nAMPA receptors (AMPARs) and kainate receptors, as well as metabotropic glutamate recep-\ntoxic cell death that results from their deregulation (66).

{"text": "===== Page 10 =====\n326 \nR.J. Wenthold et al. \nFig. 2. Summary of NMDAR trafficking at the synapse in mature forebrain. NMDARs are \nclustered at the postsynaptic membrane. Their presence in this region is regulated by interac-\ntions with PDZ proteins and adhesion molecules that can serve as scaffolds to bring them into \ncontact with signaling and regulatory proteins (see sections on interacting proteins). The num-\nber of NMDARs at the synapse can also be modulated by their addition or removal from the \nsynaptic membrane (see Section 4.1.1). To be internalized, NMDARs move to an endocytic \nzone located in the perisynaptic membrane to undergo clathrin-dependent endocytosis. \nNMDARs may also be internalized by a clathrin-independent pathway, although this mecha-\nnism is not well defined. The insertion of newly synthesized or recycled NMDARs may occur \nin the endocytic zone or the postsynaptic density. In addition, mobile pools of NMDARs may \ndiffuse laterally between the extrasynaptic and synaptic membranes (see Section 5). Down-\nstream signaling of extrasynaptic and synaptic NMDARs may differ, resulting in deactivation \nor activation, respectively, of CREB and BDNF. \nthe olfactory system requires NMDAR activation and enhances the expression of \nNR2A-containing receptors relative to NR2B-containing receptors in the piriform \ncortex (270). However, there also may be regional differences in the mechanisms of \nsynaptic insertion for NR2A- and NR2B-containing receptors. In hippocampal slices \nprepared from rats at P6-7 and cultured for approximately 2.5 days, the insertion of \nNR2B-containing receptors does not change the kinetics of synaptic NMDARs (12), \nwhereas the insertion of NR2A-containing receptors induces a faster decay time (12, \n272). This suggests that both are replacing pre-existing NR2B-containing receptors. \nIn contrast, in cerebellar granule cells harvested at P6 and cultured for 6-8 DIV, \noverexpression of NR2B slows the decay of NMDAR-mediated currents and over-"}
{"text": "===== Page 11 =====\nMolecular Properties and Cell Biology of the NMDA Receptor\n327\n \n \n \n \nexpression of NR2A quickens their kinetics (268), indicating that both types of \nNMDARs can replace the other form.  \n \nThe mechanism that determines the number of synaptic NMDARs is unknown, \nalthough it appears to be distinct from the mechanism regulating extrasynaptic recep-\ntors. In cultured cerebellar granule cells, overexpression of NR2A or NR2B subunits \ncauses an increase in the total number of functional NMDARs, whereas overexpres-\nsion of the NR1 subunit does not (268). However, overexpression of NR2 subunits \ndoes not change the number of synaptic receptors, indicating that synaptic receptors \nare not regulated solely by availability. On the other hand, extrasynaptic receptors \nappear to be determined, at least to some extent, by the number of receptors synthe-\nsized. It is important, however, to point out that this latter property may vary among \ndifferent neuron types. \n \n \n \nThe removal of synaptic receptors likely requires at least three stages. First, the \nreceptor is released from its anchor that holds it at the synapse. Second, for clathrin-\ndependent internalization, the receptor moves in the plasma membrane to the edge of \nthe synapse either by diffusion or some form of active transport (see Section 5). \nFinally, the receptor is removed from the plasma membrane. Most current evidence \nshows that NMDARs are endocytosed through a clathrin-dependent mechanism \n(176, 237, 258, 279, 348). For clathrin-dependent internalization from the plasma \nmembrane, proteins often contain an endocytic motif that is recognized by the AP-2 \nadaptor complex. Interestingly, NR2A and NR2B subunits use different motifs for \nremoval. The NR2B subunit has a tyrosine-based YXXФ consensus motif, YEKL, \nnear its C-terminus that can bind to AP-2 and promote clathrin-dependent internali-\nzation (279). In contrast, a homologous tyrosine-based YKKM motif on the NR2A \nsubunit is not involved with NMDAR endocytosis, but rather, a dileucine motif (LL), \nwhich also binds to the AP-2 complex, is involved in endocytosis of NR2A subunits \n(176). Another YXXФ consensus motif of the NR2A subunit near its last transmem-\nbrane domain binds to AP-2 and leads to use-dependent rundown of NMDAR cur-\nrent (348). In fact, tyrosine-containing motifs present near the last transmembrane \ndomain of all NR2 subunits are involved in NMDAR internalization and may target \nNMDARs to late endosomes for degradation (294). Therefore, multiple sites on the \nC-termini of both NR1 and NR2 subunits are involved in endocytosis of NMDARs, \nand additional sites are likely to be identified. \n \nRecent evidence suggests that NMDARs may also be removed by nonclathrin-\nmediated pathways. For instance, prolonged activation of NMDARs leads to their \ndegradation by calpain in a process that is not dependent on clathrin-mediated endo-\ncytosis (371). In clathrin-independent pathways, endocytosis occurs via uncoated \ninvaginations in lipid rafts (149, 234), microdomains of the membrane proposed to \nact as platforms for neurotransmitter signaling (5). Although little is known about \nclathrin-independent internalization of NMDARs, it may occur in concert with \nclathrin-mediated pathways. Similar to the paradigm for internalization of epidermal \ngrowth factor receptors (302), higher levels of glutamate in the synapse may trigger \nclathrin-independent removal of NMDARs. The site of clathrin-independent endocy-\ntosis is undefined."}
{"text": "===== Page 12 =====\n328 \nR.J. Wenthold et al. \n \n \nOnce NMDARs are removed from the synaptic membrane, the intracellular \npathways of NR2A- and NR2B-containing receptors diverge. Both encounter early \nendosomes, but then most NR2B-containing receptors are sent to recycling en-\ndosomes, whereas most NR2A-containing receptors travel to late endosomes (176). \nThis implies that although NR2B-containing receptors are endocytosed more readily \nthan NR2A-containing receptors (176), they are more likely to recycle and return to \nthe synapse. \n4.1.2 Modification of NMDARs by Phosphorylation  \nMembers of the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) family include Src, Fyn, Lyn, Lck, \nand Yes. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on NR2A and NR2B subunits potenti-\nates NMDAR-mediated currents (357). Tyrosine residues exist on NR2A and NR2B \nsubunits (283). The YEKL internalization motif on the NR2B subunit discussed \nabove contains the tyrosine residue Tyr1472 that is a major substrate for Fyn kinase \n(231). In cerebellar granule cells, phosphorylation of this residue by Fyn increases \nthe synaptic localization of NMDARs by preventing their internalization (267). Also, \nin striatal tissue of Fyn knockout mice, basal tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and \nNR2B is reduced and NMDARs fail to redistribute to the synapse upon stimulation \nof dopamine receptors (72). \n \nCalcium influx through NMDARs generates the production of cyclic AMP, \nwhich activates cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). PKA can phosphory-\nlate NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunits. This phosphorylation can increase NMDAR \nactivity by promoting synaptic targeting (54) or enhancing calcium permeability of \nNMDARs (305). PKA also can associate indirectly with NMDARs via Yotiao, al-\nlowing it to overcome the constitutive activity of protein phosphatase 1 (366). In \naddition, PKA can have indirect effects on NMDARs, such as in its phosphorylation \nof the immediate early gene cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), \nwhich can then activate other signaling cascades such as the MAP kinase pathway or \ninduce new protein synthesis (352). Due to its calcium-dependent role, PKA is im-\nportant for the induction of LTP and spatial long-term memory (1). \n \nProtein kinase C (PKC) also phosphorylates NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunits. \nPKC activation increases the amplitude of NMDAR-mediated currents and channel \nopen probability (43, 101, 374), in part by increasing the number of NMDARs in-\nserted into the synaptic membrane (167). However, these enhancements are probably \ndue to indirect signaling through second messenger cascades (390). Direct phos-\nphorylation of NMDARs by PKC induces rapid dispersal of NMDARs from the \nsynaptic to extrasynaptic membrane (87, 329) and increases their sensitivity to inac-\ntivation by intracellular Ca2+ (202). \n \nActivation of casein kinase II (CKII) potentiates NMDAR activity by prolonging \nchannel open time (187) and may contribute to the induction of LTP (39). CKII may \nalso facilitate the replacement of NR2B-containing receptors with NR2A-containing \nreceptors because it phosphorylates serine residue Ser1480 in the PDZ binding do-\nmain of the NR2B subunit, thereby blocking the interaction of NR2B-containing \nreceptors with PDZ proteins and decreasing their surface expression in an activity-\ndependent manner (49)."}
{"text": "===== Page 13 =====\nMolecular Properties and Cell Biology of the NMDA Receptor\n329\n \n \n \n \nCyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) phosphorylates NR2A subunits at serine resi-\ndue Ser1232 (184). This modification is important for mediating NMDA-evoked \nsynaptic currents during the induction of LTP (184), as well as ischemic degenera-\ntion of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (355). \n4.1.3 Other Modifications  \nUbiquitin conjugation involves the sequential actions of ubiquitin-activating en-\nzymes (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and ubiquitin ligases (E3) (362). \nThe E3 ubiquitin ligase confers protein specificity, in part by forming a complex \nwith F-box proteins. Many postsynaptic proteins undergo ubiquitination and subse-\nquent degradation by proteasomes, and this process may be dependent on neuronal \nactivity (78). It is unclear whether NMDARs undergo ubiquitination. In synapto-\nsomal membranes from cortical neurons, ubiquitination of the NR1, NR2A, and \nNR2B subunits was not detectable (78). However, in a separate study, expression \ncloning identified F-box protein 2 (Fbx2) as an interactor of the NR1 subunit (143). \nFbx2 was shown to induce the ubiquitination of the NR1 subunit in HEK293T cells \nthrough binding to high-mannose glycans on the extracellular domain of the NR1 \nsubunit. Interestingly, effects of Fbx2 inhibition on NMDAR ubiquitination were \nonly observed under conditions of enhanced neuronal activity (143). \n \nNMDARs are also modified by S-nitrosylation of cysteines of the NR2A subunit \nby nitric oxide, which can down regulate ion channel activity (47). \n4.1.4 Interactions with PDZ Proteins  \nNMDARs can bind to the PDZ domains of all MAGUKs (156, 171, 235). MAGUKs \nare abundant at all excitatory synapses, although their expression varies during de-\nvelopment. In the hippocampus, the expression of SAP102 peaks during early devel-\nopment whereas the expressions of PSD-95 and PSD-93 are highest during adult-\nhood (82, 287). This parallels the developmental shift from NR2B-containing \nreceptors to NR2A-containing receptors at synapses, suggesting that SAP102 may \npreferentially bind to NR2B-containing receptors and PSD-95 and PSD-93 may \nselectively bind to NR2A-containing receptors (287, 336). \n \nMAGUKs may function as anchors that retain and cluster proteins such as \nNMDARs at a particular cellular location. Studies on animal models have shown that \nthe NR2 C-terminus is required for synaptic localization of NMDARs (312, 317). \nHowever, these results, in which nearly the entire C-terminus was deleted, could be \ndue to the loss of other components of the C-terminus rather than only the PDZ bind-\ning domain. Studies using transfection of wild type and mutant NMDAR subunits \n \nActivity-dependent calcium influx induces autophosphorylation of Ca2+/ \ncalmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), leading to its increased localiza-\ntion at the postsynaptic density (67, 299). CaMKII can bind NR1, NR2A, or NR2B \nsubunits (100, 180), although its interaction with NR2B-containing receptors is much \nstronger than with NR2A-containing receptors (320). The interaction of CaMKII and \nNR2B-containing receptors locks CaMKII in an active conformation (16), enabling it \nto phosphorylate AMPARs and mediate LTP (7, 13, 63)."}
{"text": "===== Page 14 =====\n330 \nR.J. Wenthold et al. \n \nhave shown that NR2B-containing receptors depend on the PDZ binding domain for \nentry/retention at the synapse (267), while NR2A-containing receptors do not (12, \n267, 327). Overexpression studies are conflicting, for in hippocampal neurons PSD-\n95 overexpression does not affect the synaptic clustering or function of NMDARs \n(81, 290), although in cerebellar granule cells it does promote the synaptic insertion \nof NR2A-containing receptors (196). Knockout mice lacking PSD-95 (218) or PSD-\n93 (208) have no significant loss of synaptic NMDARs. However, double knockout \nmice lacking both PSD-95 and PSD-93 show a reduction in NMDAR-mediated cur-\nrents (82), indicating that compensatory mechanisms may stabilize NMDARs at \n \nMAGUKs also function as scaffolds that bring NMDARs into contact with regu-\nlatory and signaling molecules. For example, interactions with MAGUKs may in-\nhibit internalization of NR2B-containing NMDARs by promoting the phosphoryla-\ntion of Tyr1472 by Fyn kinase (72, 267), thus preventing the interaction of the NR2B \nsubunit with AP-2 (see Section 4.1.1). Some proteins can be linked to NMDARs by \nbinding to adjacent PDZ domains of MAGUKs. Examples include neuronal nitric \noxide synthase (nNOS), which can mediate NMDAR-induced excitotoxicity (36), \nand synaptic Ras-GTPase activating protein (SynGAP), which couples NMDARs to \nthe MAP kinase pathway (148). Other proteins may be linked to NMDARs by \nguanylate kinase-associated protein (GKAP), a central molecule that binds to the GK \ndomain of MAGUKs (146). For instance, GKAP binds to Shank, which binds to \nHomer dimers that then bind to various other proteins including metabotropic gluta-\nmate receptors or IP3 receptors (230, 339). \n \nNMDARs are linked to the actin cytoskeleton through interactions (147) such as \nPSD-95-SPAR-actin, GKAP-Shank-cortactin-actin, or PSD-95-citron, which is a \ntarget of Rho (94). NMDARs can also associate with actin filaments via actinin \n(372) or α1-chimerin, an inhibitor of Rac1 (344). This suggests a mechanism for \nNMDAR activity to control overall spine structure (see Section 6.2). \n \nOther PDZ proteins that can also act as scaffolding molecules for NMDARs \ninclude synaptic scaffolding molecule (S-SCAM) (125) and channel interacting PDZ \ndomain protein (CIPP) (161). CIPP is highly expressed in thalamus, colliculi, cere-\nbellum, and brainstem, and can also bind to adhesion molecules (161). S-SCAM can \nlink the MAP kinase pathway to NMDARs by binding to nRap GEP (neural \nGDP/GTP exchange protein for Rap1 small G-protein). S-SCAM (or PSD-95) also \nbinds to membrane-associated guanylate kinase interacting protein (MAGUIN) \n(377), which may affect cell polarity (242). \n4.1.5 Interactions with Adhesion Molecules  \nNMDARs interact directly and indirectly with a variety of adhesion molecules at the \nsynapse, including some that act transynaptically to link NMDARs to the presynaptic \nterminal. Adhesion molecules play a role in the formation, maturation, function, and \nplasticity of synapses (56). Similar to PDZ proteins, one of their functions may be to \nsynapses. NMDARs are less affected than AMPARs by changes in MAGUK expres-\nsion. Acute knockdown studies using shRNA for PSD-95 show either no change in \nNMDARs while AMPARs decrease (82) or a moderate reduction in NMDA EPSCs \n(79)."}
{"text": "===== Page 15 =====\nMolecular Properties and Cell Biology of the NMDA Receptor\n331\n \n \n \ncluster NMDARs at synapses. Recent evidence suggests that PDZ proteins and adhe-\nsion molecules work together (95, 278), perhaps in a compensatory manner. \n \nThe binding of presynaptic ephrin-B to postsynaptic EphB receptors induces a \ndirect interaction of EphB receptors with the extracellular domain of NR1 subunits \n(57) that enhances NMDAR-mediated synaptic function (108, 120). Activated EphB \nreceptors also have tyrosine kinase activity that can indirectly potentiate NMDAR-\nmediated Ca2+ influx (325) and lead to synapse formation (57). EphB is critical for \nthe formation of the postsynaptic density and dendritic spines (121). \n \nA family of synaptic adhesion-like molecules (SALMs) was recently discovered \non the basis of its interactions with MAGUKs (153, 353). Of the five members, \nSALMS1-3 have PDZ binding domains which could allow SALMs to be linked \nindirectly with NMDARs at the synapse. However, SALM1 can also bind directly to \nthe extracellular domain of the NR1 subunit when expressed in heterologous cells \n(353). Although a presynaptic ligand has not yet been found, SALM1 and SALM2 \ncan induce synapse formation and neurite outgrowth (153, 353). \n \nOther families of transynaptic adhesion molecules may act indirectly to affect \nsynaptic NMDARs ((56); see also the Section 6.1 below). Presynaptic neurexin binds \nto postsynaptic neuroligin, which interacts with the MAGUKs. Neuroligin localiza-\ntion at synapses may help recruit NMDARs to synapses and determine if developing \nsynapses become excitatory or inhibitory (182). Similarly, homophilic interactions \nbetween presynaptic and postsynaptic cadherins induce interaction with postsynaptic \nβ-catenin, which can bind directly to the PDZ scaffold S-SCAM and may control its \nsynaptic targeting (236). NrCAM binds directly to SAP102 (59) and has been impli-\ncated in neuronal positioning and dendrite orientation (62). NCAM180 may interact \ndirectly with the NR2A subunit (96) to help mediate synaptic plasticity (31). Fur-\nthermore, integrins mediate the developmental switch from NR2B-containing recep-\ntors to NR2A-containing receptors at synapses (41) and potentiate NMDAR-\nmediated currents by activating src tyrosine kinases (21, 190). \n4.2 Presynaptic NMDARs \nNMDARs are also found at the presynaptic terminal. The effect of presynaptic \nNMDARs on synaptic transmission varies among regions of the central nervous \nsystem. In some areas they negatively regulate neuronal excitability. They can inhibit \nglutamate release in spinal cord (11), enhance GABA release in cerebellum (71), or \nmediate LTD in the cerebellum (38), cortex (304), and retinotectal projections (188). \nHowever, in other brain regions they positively impact synaptic transmission. Acti-\nvation of presynaptic NMDARs enhances glutamate release in hippocampal CA1 \npyramidal neurons during early postnatal development (203) and is involved in asso-\nciative LTP of the lateral amygdala (128). Interestingly, the function of presynaptic \nNMDARs in the entorhinal cortex decreases during development but can be elevated \nduring epileptic states (375). Presynaptic NMDARs may preferentially contain \nNR2B (138, 375) or NR2D subunits (11, 203, 328) along with NR1 subunits with \nexon 5 inserts in the N-terminal domain (356)."}
{"text": "===== Page 16 =====\n332 \nR.J. Wenthold et al. \n \n5 Extrasynaptic NMDARs \n5.1 Distribution \nNMDARs in extrasynaptic membrane locations, i.e., anywhere except within the \nsynaptic junction, consist largely of NR1/NR2B and NR1/NR2D receptor complexes \n(30, 183, 333); in fact, NR1/NR2D may never enter the synapse (30). In much of the \nadult brain, typical mature synapses contain mainly NMDARs with NR2A, while \nNR2B-containing NMDARs are common in the extrasynaptic membrane (255, 333, \n336). One explanation for this pattern is that NR2B-containing NMDARs are re-\nmoved more readily from synapses than NR2A-containing NMDARs (176, 255, \n336); in contrast, NR2A-containing NMDARs form more stable associations with \nPSD-95 at synapses (12, 255, 336). Nevertheless, this separation of NR2A in syn-\napses and NR2B in the extrasynaptic membrane is not absolute, since some NR2B \noccurs in adult synapses ((257, 333); either as NR1/NR2B or NR1/NR2A/NR2B). \nConversely, extrasynaptic NMDARs can contain NR2A (183, 281, 327). Unlike \nhippocampal neurons, cerebellar granule cells lose all of their NR2B, both synaptic \nand extrasynaptic, in later maturation and have both NR2A and NR2C in the adult \n(91, 281). \n5.2 Function \nThe function of the predominant separation of NMDARs into synaptic NR2A-\ncontaining and extrasynaptic NR2B-containing receptors in adults is not clear, but \nmay relate to a separation of short distance (synaptic) and long distance (extrasynap-\ntic) signals. Thus, a precise release of glutamate at the synapse could activate synap-\ntic receptors, while extensive release of glutamate followed by spillover into the \nextrasynaptic spaces could be required to activate extrasynaptic receptors. In this \nway, extrasynaptic NMDARs could elicit plastic changes to compensate for synapse \noveractivity. NR2A has been reported to be associated mainly with LTP and NR2B \nmainly with LTD (193, 369) although several studies show that both NR2A and \nNR2B can induce LTP (20, 363). However, problems in specificity of the antagonist \nused in the former studies make their results for NR2A problematic (90, 233, 363). \nrundown (decline in peak current with repeated, sustained agonist application) than \nsynaptic NMDARs, apparently for both NR2A- and NR2B-containing NMDARs \n(183). Rundown may protect neurons from damage following hyperactivity leading \nto glutamate spillover. In addition, activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs generates \ninhibitory currents via BK-type calcium-activated potassium channels in rat olfactory \nbulb granule cells (134). Also, synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs can mediate \nopposite long-term changes in neuron gene expression, probably due to differences \nin their local, associated signaling complexes (reviewed by (214, 346, 388)). The \nsignaling pathways of synaptic NMDARs selectively activate a regulatory cascade \ninvolving Ras, the kinase ERK, and CREB, while that of extrasynaptic NMDARs \ninactivate them.

Activation of synaptic NMDARs may up-regulate pro-\nsurvival genes and down-regulate pro-death genes, while activation of extrasynaptic \nNMDARs does the exact opposite (214, 388). Lastly, a more general function of \nextrasynaptic NMDARs is to form a mobile reserve pool of receptors for interchange \nwith those in the synapse (338) (see below). \n5.3 Localization, Mobility, and Relation to Synaptic Receptors \nRelatively little is known about the arrangement and distribution of extrasynaptic \nNMDARs on the neuron cell membrane; in fact, relatively little is known about \ngeneral protein distribution on the plasma membrane (163, 189). Some of the func-\ntional studies noted above indicate the presence of some extrasynaptic NMDARs that \nmay be stabilized in extrasynaptic domains, but other extrasynaptic NMDARs may \nbe moving to sites of endocytosis or moving out of sites of exocytosis. In some \ncases, extrasynaptic NMDARs may associate with specialized non-synaptic junctions \nsuch as the cadherin-based attachment plaques of the cerebellar glomeruli. These \ncontain abundant NMDARs and associated PSD-95, and thus glutamate spillover \nfrom adjacent synapses in the glomerulus may control the overall stability of the \nglomerulus (262). Other examples of specialized extrasynaptic locations of \nNMDARs are those on or near exocytic or endocytic zones or in the perisynaptic \nregion directly surrounding the synapse. In addition, there are extrasynaptic \nNMDARs of presynaptic membranes. \n \nClathrin-mediated endocytosis of NMDARs (and glutamate receptors in general) \nmay be localized mainly to the extrasynaptic membrane on the side of a spine (24, \n258, 273). While this location is typical for endocytosis in mature synaptic spines, in \nimmature synapses and early postnatal ages, the site of endocytosis often is located \nat the edge of the postsynaptic density (PSD) in the perisynaptic region (24, 258). \nOnly a few examples of labeling for NMDARs in clathrin-coated pits have been \nfound ((258) and Petralia et al., unpublished data). Also, RNAi knockdown of CPG2 \n(candidate plasticity gene 2), which is localized specifically to the postsynaptic en-\ndocytotic zone of excitatory synapses, increases the number of postsynaptic clathrin-\ncoated vesicles, including some that contain NMDARs, and increases the number of \nsurface NR1 and AMPAR GluR2 molecules (53). \n \nTargeting of the NMDARs to sites of endocytosis may be influenced by stabiliza-\ntion of NMDARs on the surface, especially in extrasynaptic locations. GIPC is asso-\nciated with endocytosis and contains a PDZ domain that binds to the C-terminal \nESDV domain of NR2B. Preliminary studies indicate that GIPC helps regulate the \nsurface stabilization, endocytosis, and recycling of NMDARs, but the localization of \nextrasynaptic GIPC/NMDAR associations is not clear (379, 380). The adaptor \nPACSIN1/syndapin1 binds to the C-terminal of the NR3A, as well as to dynamin \nand the actin-organizing protein N-WASP, and mediates the selective endocytosis of \nNR3A-containing NMDARs during postnatal development. This mechanism is activ-\nity-dependent and may help regulate synaptic maturation (253). In this case, NR3A \nis localized largely in the outer zone of the synapse and in the adjacent perisynaptic"}

Wenthold et al. \n \narea; it is suggested that PACSIN1 might facilitate movement of NR3A out of syn-\napses and into the endocytic zone on the side of the spine. \n \nIt is not clear exactly where NMDARs and other glutamate receptors enter the \nplasma membrane via exocytosis (105, 152). Labeling for AMPARs is often seen in \npit-like structures, without evident clathrin coats, on the sides of spines in adults \n(258, 259, 332). These structures probably correspond to the noncoated pits seen in \nstructural studies in these locations (311) and could be exocytic sites or noncoated \nendocytic sites. Preliminary data indicate that the soluble NSF attachment protein \nreceptor (SNARE), SNAP-23, is concentrated in this area, suggesting that these are \nsites of exocytosis or sites of lipid raft/caveoli, which might be involved in receptor \nregulation (64, 123, 141). In addition to these possible sites of exocytosis of AM-\nPARs on the sides of spines (248), we also find immunogold-labeled vesicles and \npits, labeled with either AMPARs or NMDARs, in the perisynaptic region and pos-\nsibly within the PSD itself (102, 259, 260). Consistent with this, some studies have \nsuggested that NMDARs could be incorporated more directly into synapses, pre-\nsumably via actin/myosin-mediated transport (110), although it also has been re-\nported that newly-exocytosed NMDARs form extrasynaptic clusters first (276). \n \nIn any case, wherever they reach the surface, NMDARs can be very mobile in the \nsurface membrane, and thus may move readily to and from sites of function (334). In \nhippocampal neuron cultures, at least 65% of synaptic NMDARs are mobile and can \nbe exchanged rapidly (334). Extrasynaptic NMDARs are not as mobile as extra-\nsynaptic AMPARs, while mobility for these two kinds of receptors is similar within \nthe synapse (104, 338). Also, while changes in neuronal activity modify AMPAR \nmobility but not NMDAR mobility, activation of PKC modifies mobility for both \n(104, 338). These latter studies employed live surface labeling of native NMDARs \non cultured hippocampal neurons using either single molecule-fluorescence micros-\ncopy tracking of receptors labeled with Cy3-coupled antibodies or single particle-\ntracking of semiconductor quantum dot-coupled antibodies. Similar methods reveal \nthat NR2A-containing NMDARs are less mobile than NR2B-containing NMDARs \n(105). In addition, overexpression of NR2A subunits reduces surface diffusion of \nNR2B-containing NMDARs, possibly due to formation of NR1/NR2A/NR2B trihet-\neromers that retain the stabilizing effect of NR2A. One caveat for these studies is \nthat they are limited by the resolution of light microscopy; their definitions of synap-\ntic versus extrasynaptic areas cannot be as accurate as those obtained with electron \nmicroscopy (EM). EM using markers such as DAB and immunogold may be useful \nfor showing surface localization of glutamate receptors including AMPARs (258) \nand NMDARs (Petralia et al., unpublished data). Nevertheless, such EM studies may \nbe affected by artifacts such as DAB “bleeding” and restrictions of movements of the \nrelatively large gold particles, which may have difficulty entering into the synaptic \ncleft (for surface labeling protocols;(258) and Petralia et al., unpublished data); simi-\nlar difficulties are indicated in the above light microscope studies comparing Cy3 \ntracking versus the larger quantum dots."}

This switchover within synapses has been confirmed specifically with \nultrastructural studies in the thalamus and cerebral cortex (84, 194) and hippocampus \n(257). The latter study examined postnatal development in the CA1 region of the \nhippocampus using EM immunogold analysis, and results correlate well with previ-\nous immunoblot analyses (287). Synaptic labeling for NR2B is highest at P2 and \ndecreases gradually to approximately half that level by P35. In contrast, immunogold \nlabeling for NR2A at synapses is present but very low at P2, and there is about \ntwelve times as much present by P35; this is consistent with mRNA studies in the \nmouse, where the first distinct signal for NR2A is in the CA1 region of the hippo-\ncampus at P1, and this is followed by a substantial increase throughout the brain over \nthe next 2 postnatal weeks (360). Interestingly, AMPARs are not common at these \nsynapses at P2, and like NR2A, they increase during maturation (261). Such syn-\napses are probably “silent synapses” (133) because, in the absence of AMPARs, the \nNMDAR channels remain blocked by magnesium during neurotransmitter release; \nactivation of these channels normally requires activation of AMPARs and the subse-\nquent change in membrane potential necessary to release the magnesium block. \nWithout AMPARs, activation of these early NMDAR-containing synapses might \nrequire initial activation of excitatory GABA receptors, which are prevalent in the \nearly postnatal brain ((342); but see also (250)). Alternatively or in addition, activa-\ntion of NR2B-containing NMDARs could be preceded by activation of NMDARs \nwith low sensitivity to magnesium, including those with NR2C, NR2D, or NR3A \n(252) (see also Sections 4.2, 5, and 6.3). Several studies show that the switch from \nNR2B- to NR2A-containing NMDARs is linked to learning experiences (255), in-\ncluding visual experience (271, 272) and rule learning in odor discrimination (270). \nNR1, NR2B, NR2D and NR3A (discussed below in relation to neuronal migration), \nand maintain this pattern in early postnatal development (see also Section 1). Over-\nall, NR2B, NR2D and NR3A tend to decrease during later postnatal development \nand maturation; conversely, NMDARs that contain NR2A and/or NR2C tend to \nbecome more abundant in the maturing brain (50, 150, 173, 360, 365); relative levels \nof different NR1 splice variants also change with age (175). This has been studied \nbest in the forebrain and cerebellum (see below), and exceptions occur in other areas. \nThus, motoneurons of the hypoglossal, facial and trigeminal motor nuclei in the \nmouse express abundant mRNA for NR2A early in development (245). In the hypo-\nglossal nucleus, NR2A mRNA is high at least by embryonic day 13 (E13) and peaks \nat P1-P7; the protein is evident at least by P1. It is likely that this early appearance of \nNR2A in these motoneurons reflects their function in the suckling reflex at birth. \nHowever, NR2A knockout mice manage to develop normally after birth, perhaps due \nto substitution of NR2B for NR2A in these circuits."}
{"text": "===== Page 20 =====\n336 \nR.J. Wenthold et al. \n \nThis change is also accompanied by an increase in PSD-95 (255, 287, 381) as dis-\ncussed in other sections of this chapter. \n \nAnother major switch in NR2 subunits of NMDARs occurs in cerebellar granule \ncells, where NR2C replaces NR2B. Once the granule cells complete migration and \nare innervated by the mossy fibers, they down-regulate NR2B and begin to express \nNR2C (246), developing in a caudal to rostral progression through the cerebellum \n(142); note also that NR2A is present during this period (91, 281). Expression of \nNR2C by granule cells is regulated by neuregulin secreted by mossy fiber terminals. \nNeuregulin can interact with ErbB2 and ErbB4 receptors on granule cells, inducing \nNR2C expression. In this case, expression of NR2C may involve MAGUKs that can \nform an indirect structural link between neuregulin and NMDARs (98, 111). \n6.2 Role in Synapse Formation \nNMDARs probably are not present in the earliest nascent excitatory synaptic con-\ntacts, which likely are formed largely by various adhesion factors ((186, 257, 391); \nlabeling for catenin shows a preference for the more immature-appearing synaptic \ncontacts, while in comparison, labeling for NR2B, SAP102, and Homer 1b/c is more \nprevalent on the mature-appearing synapses, again suggesting a progression with \nadhesion proteins preceding entry of other proteins at early synaptic contacts (257). \n \nAfter the initial contact mediated by adhesion factors, presynaptic components \ncan be delivered in packets, followed by delivery of postsynaptic MAGUKs and \nNMDARs (89, 186). This process is surprisingly rapid; a distinctive PSD containing \nmultiple proteins linked directly or indirectly to NMDARs is formed in less than two \nhours (28, 89). Consistent with this, ultrastructural studies of the developing CA1 \nregion of the hippocampus at P2 reveal that many PSDs appear to be relatively ma-\nture and they label with immunogold for many of the proteins found in adult syn-\napses (257). Also, the spatial arrangements of these proteins resemble those found in \nthe adult. Thus, at all ages studied (P2, P10 and adult), positions of gold labeling for \nPSD proteins reflect their molecular associations. For example, NMDARs at the \npostsynaptic membrane link to MAGUKs, which link to GKAP and subsequently to \nShank and Homer; these latter two are positioned below the density where they can \nform further links to proteins in internal storage organelles and to other proteins in \nsee also above in Section 4.1.5). One example is NCAM, which associates with both \nsides of nascent synaptic contacts and may play a major role in synaptogenesis and \nsynapse maturation (266, 323). Other adhesion factors implicated in the earliest \ncontacts are neuroligin, EphB receptors, and cadherins/catenins (discussed above in \nthe Section 4.1.5). In the CA1 stratum radiatum of the hippocampus, immunogold \nthe perisynaptic membrane surrounding the synapse.  \n \nIn these developing synapses of the hippocampus, while this basic chain of mole-\ncules remains the same throughout postnatal development, the forms of the first  \nthree components, i.e., NMDARs, MAGUKs, and GKAP, change from types preva-\nlent in early development to those more prevalent in the adult. Thus, as noted above: \n(1) the predominant NMDAR changes from NR2B- to mainly NR2A-containing, (2) \nthe predominant MAGUK changes from SAP102 to mainly PSD-95, and also (3) the \npredominant GKAP changes from mainly a higher molecular weight form (130 kD)"}
{"text": "===== Page 21 =====\nMolecular Properties and Cell Biology of the NMDA Receptor\n337\n \n \n \n \nThe final stage in the maturation of excitatory synapses, especially those on prin-\ncipal output neurons, is the development of the postsynaptic spine. A number of \nproteins that bind to NMDARs or to NMDAR-associated proteins help regulate actin \nformation, which is a major component of spine formation. The NR2A-binding pro-\ntein α1-chimerin contains a GTPase-activating (GAP) domain that can inhibit the \nRho GTPase family member Rac1; Rac1 promotes actin polymerization, increases \ndendrite arbor complexity, and stimulates spine formation (344). EphB2 receptors \n6.3 Neuronal Migration and Neurite Outgrowth \nNMDARs are expressed on the surface of young neurons prior to synapse formation \nand can modulate neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth and differentiation. In \nmice, mRNAs for NR1 and NR2B are widespread throughout the brain (along with a \nmore restricted distribution of NR2D) by E13 (360). Also, NR3A mRNA is present \nin the rat brain at least by E15 (50), and its earliest distribution is somewhat similar \nto that of NR2D in mice. In rats, functional NMDARs that respond to endogenous \nneurotransmitters appear on neurons of the cortical plate at least by E16 (within one \nday of the first appearance of this structure; (197)). Neuronal migration appears to \nto a more even mixture of two forms (130 and 95 kD) in the adult (257, 287, 345, \n381). Note, however, that in adults, NR2B and SAP102 are still fairly common at \nsynapses in the hippocampus, but the overall pattern of NMDAR/MAGUK/GKAP \nhas changed dramatically during maturation. The importance of these changes is \nreflected in studies of NR2A knockout mice (336). In visual neurons in these mice, \nPSD-95 may not form an effective scaffold for NR2B-containing NMDARs, since \nthere is a selective loss of spontaneous NMDAR currents in these mice during devel-\nopment. Again, normally there would be a general replacement of NR2B-containing \nNMDARs that are associated with SAP102, with NR2A-containing NMDARs \nthat are associated with PSD-95. However, it is not clear how selective this \nNMDAR/MAGUK association may be; at least in adults, NR2A and NR2B appear to \nassociate equally with SAP102, PSD-95 and PSD-93 (3). Another change during \nsynapse maturation is the appearance of CaMKIIα, which is usually absent from \nearly postnatal synapses (257); although other isoforms such as CaMKIIβ may be \npresent early on. Switching from NR2B-containing NMDARs, which bind CaMKII \nwith high affinity, to NR2A-containing NMDARs, which bind CaMKII with low \naffinity, results in a substantial reduction in LTP and may be associated with the \nreduced plasticity of glutamatergic synapses of the mature forebrain (13). \ncan bind to NMDARs and play a role in Rac regulation and spine formation ((221, \n330, 331); see also Sections 4.1.4 and 4.1.5). SPAR is a Rap-specific GAP that binds \nto the GK domain of PSD-95 and regulates spine morphology, both via a direct in-\nteraction with actin and perhaps also through Rap signaling (247). Finally, citron is a \nPSD-95-associated protein that may mediate forms of NMDAR-dependent synaptic \nplasticity in some specialized neurons; it is a target of Rho, which regulates organi-\nzation of the actin skeleton (94, 389). In spite of these studies indicating that \nNMDARs play roles in spine formation, mice with CA1-targeted NR1-knockout \n(NR1 is lost gradually, mainly during late postnatal development) nevertheless can \nmaintain spines and even may produce new spines in the adult after environmental \nenrichment (92, 275)."}

In the mouse embryonic cortex, glutamate \nacts at NMDARs to stimulate neuronal migration (18). In the hippocampus, GABA \nand NMDA receptors modulate radial migration of pyramidal neurons, while, in \ncontrast, tangential migration of interneurons involves AMPARs but not GABA or \nNMDARs (204, 205). In the mouse olfactory bulb, tangentially migrating neurons \nexpress GABA receptors first, then calcium-impermeable (presumably containing \nGluR2) AMPARs, and express NMDARs only after changing to radial migration \n(37). Similarly, migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons from their \norigin in the nose and then into the brain is enhanced by AMPAR (including all four \nAMPAR subunits) activation (303). Once in the brain, these neurons begin express-\ning NMDARs, which may slow migration. In the mouse cerebellum, the rate of \ngranule cell migration is regulated by changes in calcium influx through N-type \ncalcium channels and NMDARs; completion of migration involves the loss of these \ntransient calcium elevations (155, 159). Note also that neuronal migration can in-\nvolve various locomotor mechanisms that differ in sensitivity to NMDAR and other \nreceptor activation. Thus, in mouse cortical interneurons, nucleokinesis (movement \nof the nucleus through the neuron) involves a calcium elevation in the proximal \nregion of the leading process, and this does not involve responses to agonists includ-\ning NMDA (227). Finally, overall neuroanatomy at birth in full NR1 knockout mice \nappears normal, suggesting that at least embryonic neuronal migration can proceed \nin the absence of functional NMDARs, presumably due to some compensatory \nmechanisms (88). \n \nOnce a neuron migrates to its final destination, it undergoes substantial differen-\ntiation involving neurite outgrowth, including both axon and dendrites, and dendrite \narborization, involving formation of specific branching patterns. Early studies impli-\ncated NMDARs in neurite outgrowth. In rat cerebellar granule cell cultures, NMDA \napplication increases the rate of neurite outgrowth and the proportion of neuronal \nprocesses with growth cones, while the NMDAR antagonist APV causes a retraction \nof existing processes (251, 277). Similarly, in rat hippocampal dentate gyrus granule \ncell cultures, NMDA increases total neurite length and the number of branch points \nper neuron, although it does not affect the number of major neurite branches off of \nthe soma (29). Interestingly, the effect of NMDARs is different for growing axons \nand dendrites. In developing neurons of Xenopus optic tectum, during early devel-\nopment of the dendritic arbor, APV treatment decreases the number of branch exten-\nsions and new branch additions (274). These effects are independent of the genera-\ntion of sodium-dependent action potentials since they are not affected by TTX. Thus, \nthey may involve NMDARs that are either extrasynaptic or are synaptic but activated \nby inputs that are below the threshold needed for firing action potentials. Later in \ndevelopment, when the dendritic arbor is more complex, AMPARs and NMDARs \nappear to work together to control the rate of branch length extension, and antago-\nnists to both AMPARs and NMDARs decrease growth rates (274). However, an-\ntagonists cannot alter rates of branch additions or retractions in these more mature \narbors. Others have found evidence that NMDARs can suppress neurite sprouting \nand elongation in cultured Xenopus optic tectal neurons (191, 220). This is depend-\nent on calcium influx through NMDARs at the earliest neurite contacts between"}

Es-\nsentially, this mechanism allows the neurite to stop growing when it has found a \nsuitable contact, and appears to apply at least to axonal neurites (effects on dendrites \nare less clear). These controls of axon growth in Xenopus optic tectal neurons were \nclarified by Ruthazer et al. (282) in which they show that NMDARs help mediate \naxon branch elimination from inappropriate locations and selective stabilization of \nbranches to appropriate locations. Similarly, in rat hippocampal slice cultures, \nNMDARs can suppress axonal outgrowth (211). Also, Colonnese et al. (52) exam-\nined axon sprouting in the superficial visual layers of the superior colliculus of the \nrat and found that during early postnatal ages, activation of NMDARs seems to re-\nduce early axon sprouting and synapse formation. In conclusion, it appears that \nNMDARs in immature neurons can stimulate the growth of the dendrite arbor and \nalso regulate the stabilization of early axon-dendrite contacts, by modulating axonal \ngrowth and synapse formation. \n7 NMDA Receptor Trafficking and Disease \nExcessive calcium influx through the NMDAR may trigger excitotoxic cell death \n(55, 201). Interestingly, increased intracellular calcium resulting from other channel \nor receptor activities does not lead to excitotoxic cell death, implying that NMDAR-\nmediated calcium influx mediates specific downstream signaling cascades that may \nultimately lead to cell death (341). While excitotoxic cell death has been regarded to \nbe the major mechanism by which NMDARs contribute to these disease states, \nmounting evidence suggests that disruptions in NMDAR trafficking and targeting \nmay play a distinct role. Loss of synaptic function, involving disruptions in protein \ncomplexes and/or NMDAR dysfunction, may mediate a collapse of the synaptic \nfunctional unit in the absence of calcium-mediated cell death. Furthermore, while \nloss of synaptic function was believed to result from excitotoxic cell death, evidence \nsuggests that these changes may actually occur before cell death and, in some dis-\neases, pre-symptomatically (85, 107, 296, 306). Thus, the complex nature of \nNMDAR function in disease states has expanded beyond the traditional view of \nexcitotoxic cell death to include NMDAR deregulation. Extensive reviews have been \npublished that thoroughly detail the role of NMDARs in multiple diseases; therefore, \nour goal is to review recent developments addressing NMDAR mistargeting in neu-\nropathological conditions (for a recent review, see (170)). \n7.1 NMDAR Subunit-Specific Determinants of Excitotoxic Cell Death \nMechanisms of NMDAR deregulation may be common to various diseases. Firstly, \nNMDAR subunit composition is an important determinant in NMDAR-mediated \nexcitotoxicity: cells transfected with NR1/NR2B or NR1/NR2A subunits are more \nsusceptible to cell death than those transfected with NR1/NR2C or NR1/NR2D \n(201). These subunit-specific effects may be determined by higher calcium perme-\nability of NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2B NMDARs. Furthermore, increases in toxicity"}
{"text": "===== Page 24 =====\n340 \nR.J. Wenthold et al. \n \noccur with development as NR2B decreases and NR2A increases (46), consistent \nwith subunit-specific vulnerability to excitotoxic cell death. \n \nSecondly, subcellular localization may determine subunit-specific effects. NR2A-\ncontaining receptors are enriched at the synapse while NR2B-containing receptors \nare found extrasynaptically and are coupled to distinct downstream signaling cas-\ncades (see Section 5). Extrasynaptic NMDARs are associated with the induction of \ncell death mechanisms, while synaptic receptors mediate induction of synaptic plas-\nticity mechanisms (116, 310). Thus, multiple factors such as subunit composition \nand localization are involved in determining whether NMDAR activation will lead to \nsynaptic plasticity or to neurotoxicity (115). \n7.2 Huntington’s Disease \nHuntington’s disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that results in \ncognitive deficits, motor decline, and mood dysfunction (118). Cell death occurs \nmost extensively in GABAergic projection medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) of \nthe neostriatum and, to a lesser extent, in the cortex (349). Expansion of the polyglu-\ntamine repeat in the gene encoding the protein huntingtin (htt) has been identified as \nthe cause of the disease (168). \n \nNumerous lines of evidence implicate the NMDAR in HD neuropathology (for \nreview, see (85)). A disproportionate loss of NMDAR binding sites occurs in the \nstriatum of HD patients compared to GABAergic or cholinergic binding sites, sug-\ngesting that NMDAR expression increases vulnerability of the neurons to cell death \n(382). Administration of NMDAR agonists such as quinolinic acid into the striatum \nin rodents and primates induces HD-like behavioral and neuropathological symptoms \n(114, 292). In addition, in cultured striatal neurons, NMDAR agonists induce neuro-\ntoxicity more effectively than agonists for other glutamate receptor subclasses (re-\nviewed in (65)). In HD, cognitive deficits often precede motor symptoms (137, 177, \n249). Similarly, presymptomatic alterations in glutamatergic transmission occur in \ndissociated cortical neurons from a mouse model of HD (8), suggesting a role for the \nNMDARs in the disease independent of excitotoxicity. In a transgenic Huntington’s \nmouse model, NMDAR physiological properties were altered in a population of \nMSNs, exhibiting an increased response to glutamate and decreased sensitivity to \nmagnesium (315). Mouse models of HD display behavioral and electrophysiological \nalterations in the absence of cell loss (181), suggesting that the observed neuropa-\nthology is not merely the result of cell death. \n \nWhile numerous studies report inconsistent results regarding changes in NMDAR \nsubunit expression (for review, see (85)), a specific role for NR2B has been identi-\nfied (44). The striatum is enriched in NR2B (160, 169) with a significantly higher \nratio of NR2B to NR2A than in cortex or hippocampus (185). Furthermore, the ma-\njority of NMDARs in MSNs are sensitive to the NR2B-specific antagonist ifen-\nprodil, which is as effective at blocking NMDAR-mediated cell death as the \nNMDAR antagonist MK-801 (387), indicating a high population of NR2B-\ncontaining receptors. The current model suggests that striatal neurons expressing \nNR2B are more susceptible to excitotoxic cell death (387) (see above in the Section \n7.1). Co-expression of NR2B with mutant htt in HEK293 cells leads to larger"}

Apoptotic cell death is also \nsignificantly greater in cells co-transfected with mutant htt and NR2B, but not NR2A \n(386). Furthermore, the NR2B subunit is enriched extrasynaptically, and a role for \nextrasynaptic NR2B-containing receptors in mediating cell death has been suggested \n(116, 310). \n \nNMDAR function may be affected by other factors, such as receptor trafficking. \nNR1 localization on the cell surface is increased in cultured MSNs from transgenic \nmice expressing htt with moderately expanded polyglutamine lengths, and NMDAR \nmay be linked to htt by cytoskeletal proteins (85), supporting a trafficking compo-\nnent.

As mentioned above, \nSrc regulates NMDAR channel activity. Additionally, changes in PKC and PKA \nphosphorylation may be affected by mutant htt (85). Studies on transgenic mouse \nmodels of HD report decrease of NR1 phosphorylation at Ser897 (136), which re-\nsults in decreased dopamine D1-mediated CREB activation (70). Inhibition of CRE-\nmediated gene transcription has been linked to HD (168), and decreased CREB ac-\ntivity has been linked to increased NMDAR-mediated cell death (116). Further sup-\nport for a role for NMDAR-mediated downstream signaling events in HD neuropa-\nthology comes from a study reporting increased CRE-mediated transcription in \ntransgenic mice over-expressing mutant htt compared with mice overexpressing \nwild-type htt (239). \n7.3 Alzheimer’s Disease \nAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized \nby impairments in memory and cognition, likely caused by the pathogenic accumula-\ntion of a hydrophobic 42-amino-acid form of the β-amyloid peptide. While much of \nthe earlier work focused on the role of the cholinergic system, mounting evidence \nsuggests AD also exhibits a glutamatergic synaptic dysfunction in early disease \nstages (296, 306). Memantine, a non-competitive antagonist that more effectively  \n \naptic localization (see above in Section 4.1.4), binds htt in transfected HEK293 cells \nand in human cortical tissue (322). The PSD-95/htt association decreases in the pres-\nence of mutant htt, presumably increasing the availability of unbound PSD-95 to \nbind to NMDARs (322) and stabilize them on the cell surface (279). Thus, wild-type \nhtt serves a neuroprotective role by blocking excessive NMDAR activity (178). \nFurthermore, PSD-95 links NMDARs to downstream signaling molecules, including \nneuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) (48); in a transgenic model of HD, a decrease \nin membrane-associated nNOS was observed in addition to a decrease in PSD-95 \n(136, 200). Therefore, the presence of mutant htt may disrupt NMDAR function not \nonly by increasing calcium influx, but also by disrupting normal synaptic function."}

Furthermore, β-amyloid oligomers were \nfound to interrupt synaptic plasticity in vivo and in slices (166) and to transiently \nimpair learned behavior in rats (51, 335, 351). Interestingly, non-toxic amounts of \nsecreted β-amyloid reduce synaptic plasticity and glutamatergic transmission (140), \nsuggesting an effect on NMDAR transmission that is independent of cell death. \n \nAlterations of NMDAR subunit expression have been reported in analyses of \npostmortem AD brain. NR1 isoforms containing the N1 alternatively spliced cassette \nare decreased in AD affected patients in brain regions most susceptible to pathologi-\ncal damage (129, 130). Furthermore, while levels of NR2C and NR2D mRNA are \nnot altered, NR2A and NR2B mRNA and protein show a decrease in susceptible \nbrain regions (131). In a study investigating subunit expression in hippocampal \nsubregions, NR1 and NR2B mRNA and protein levels were reduced, while NR2A \nmRNA and protein levels were unchanged (219), suggesting an altered neuronal \nvulnerability. Additional studies investigating subunit expression have reported in-\nconsistent results, suggesting that additional mechanisms may be involved in the \nneuropathological changes (reviewed in (132)). \n \nProtein trafficking may also play a role in the neuropathology of AD. Interest-\ningly, β-amyloid decreases NMDAR localization at synaptic sites (308). Addition-\nally, the 42-amino-acid form of β-amyloid increases endocytosis of NMDAR in \ncultured cortical neurons and in transgenic mice expressing mutant amyloid precur-\nsor protein (APP), with no affect on the GABAA β 2/3 subunit (308). Furthermore, \nan increase in the tyrosine phosphatase function of Striatal-Enriched Phosphatase \n(STEP) is responsible for the decrease in phosphorylation of NR2B at Tyr1472 \n(308), which results in increased endocytosis of the receptor (279). One might specu-\nlate that prolonged depression of NMDAR-mediated transmission may initiate the \npathological changes. Alternatively, a depression of NMDAR function may be neu-\nroprotective based on the finding that preconditioning with β-amyloid reduces glu-\ntamate-induced neurotoxicity by promoting endocytosis of NMDARs (103). \n7.4 Parkinson’s Disease \nParkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive disorder characterized by degeneration of \nthe dopaminergic neurons projecting from the substantia nigra to the striatum. Ani-\nmal models of PD, including nigrostriatal denervation induced by 6-\nhydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injections, mimic this dopamine deficit (112) (for \nreview, see (99, 113)). Treatment with L-DOPA (levodopa) alleviates the character-\nistic symptoms of PD, which include resting tremors, rigidity, and other motor symp-\ntoms. However, chronic treatment results in dyskinesia, i.e., abnormal, involuntary \nspasmodic movements (113). NMDAR antagonists, including the NR2B antagonists"}
{"text": "===== Page 27 =====\nMolecular Properties and Cell Biology of the NMDA Receptor\n343\n \n \n \nifenprodil and CP-101,606, are effective in reducing the neuropathology in experi-\nmental models (195, 232) as well as in humans (343), suggesting a role for the glu-\ntamatergic system in PD neuropathology. \n \nAlterations in the subcellular organization and function of NMDARs have been \n(112) (for review, see (99, 113)). In the unilateral 6-OHDA model of PD, alterations \nin synaptic function include reorganization of spines (34), decrease in synapse num-\nber (9), and reduction of LTP and LTD (32, 33). Also, changes in NMDAR binding \nhas been reported in experimental models of PD and human postmortem PD brain \n(reviewed in (113)). In human postmortem brain of PD patients, NR1 expression is \nnot altered (35, 217); however, in a nonhuman primate model of dyskinesia, NR2A \nis upregulated (112). \n \nChanges in subunit composition, subcellular localization, and phosphorylation \nstates of NMDARs have been reported in 6-OHDA mouse models of PD (74, 216, \n265). Similarly, in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, NR2B redistributes from a synaptic \nto an extrasynaptic localization (99). While no changes were observed in total \nNMDAR subunit expression ((74, 216); but see (240)), the abundance of NR1 and \nNR2B in synaptosomal membrane fractions was found to decrease in the lesioned \nstriatum relative to unlesioned striatum, with no change in NR2A (74), indicating \ndecreased synaptic localization. Significantly, chronic L-DOPA treatment of 6-\nOHDA-lesioned rats restores the abundance of NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunits in \nhomogenate and synaptosomal membrane fractions (74, 240). \n \nWhile the exact mechanisms by which NR2B-containing receptors redistribute \nfollowing 6-OHDA lesions are not known, these may be affected by changes in \nphosphorylation. NR2A and NR2B subunits in the synaptosomal membrane, but not \nthe light membrane of synaptic vesicle-enriched fractions, are tyrosine phosphory-\nlated (73). While no changes were measured in the phosphorylation of NR2A or \nNR2B in total homogenates (74, 216), changes in NR2B tyrosine phosphorylation \nwere reported in the PD 6-OHDA lesion model (216, 240). This decrease in NR2B \nphosphorylation is specific for the subpopulation of NMDARs in the membrane \nfraction (74), suggesting that changes in phosphorylation alter subcellular localiza-\ntion in PD. In support of this model, the dopamine D1 agonist increases NR1, NR2A, \nand NR2B localization to the synaptosomal membrane fraction and tyrosine phos-\nphorylation of the subunits located in that fraction (73). \n \nFurthermore, dopamine depletion decreases phosphorylation of NR1 at Ser890 \nand Ser896 in a unilateral 6-OHDA rat model of PD (74). While Ser897 was not \naffected in this study, increased phosphorylation was reported in another study utiliz-\ning the 6-OHDA model, as well as in an MPTP primate model of PD (23). Phos-\nphorylation of Ser890 results in the dispersion of surface NMDARs (329), and in-\ncreased phosphorylation at Ser897 results in increased dopamine D1-mediated \nCREB activation (see Section 7.2 above) (70). Also, an increase in serine phosphory-\nlation of NR2A, but not NR2B, was reported (241). Interestingly, chronic L-DOPA \ntreatment enhances serine phosphorylation of NR1 at Ser890, Ser896, and Ser897 \nand of NR2A, as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of both NR2A and NR2B (74, \n240, 241). These results indicate that surface delivery and/or stabilization can be \nregulated by dopamine via alterations in NMDAR subunit phosphorylation. \nreported in animal models of PD, as well as following chronic L-DOPA treatment"}
{"text": "===== Page 28 =====\n344 \nR.J. Wenthold et al. \n \n7.5 Schizophrenia and Mood Disorders \nInvestigations into therapies for schizophrenia and mood disorders have more re-\ncently focused on the glutamate dysfunction hypothesis (313). In the case of schizo-\nphrenia, reduction of NMDAR function by non-competitive antagonists such as \nketamine or phencyclidine result in dopaminergic hyperactivity and behavioral \nchanges characteristic of schizophrenia (199). Altered NR1, NR2A, NR2B, and, \ninterestingly, NR3A expression has been reported in postmortem tissue of schizo-\nphrenic patients (68, 97, 212, 229). Additionally, mice expressing only 5% of normal \nlevels of NR1 display behavioral abnormalities that correlate with schizophrenia, \nwhich can be reversed by treatment with the antipsychotics haloperidol or clozapine \n(223). Decreased striatal expression of SAP102 was reported (158), suggesting pos-\nsible changes in trafficking or localization of NMDARs. Interestingly, schizophrenia \nis associated with hypofunction of the glutamatergic system (313); notably, this is \nstrong evidence that NMDARs play a role in neuropathologies such as schizophrenia \nby mechanisms other than excitotoxic cell death. \n \nNeuregulins, which are widely expressed growth and differentiation factors, have \nbeen genetically linked to schizophrenia (316). Neuregulin function has been associ-\nated with changes in glutamatergic synapse function (109, 111), perhaps providing a \nlink between neuregulins, glutamatergic hypofunction, and schizophrenia. The \nneuregulin-β isoform has been shown to induce NR2C mRNA expression in cultured \ncerebellar granule cells in an NMDAR activity-dependent manner (246). Further-\nmore, in the prefrontal cortex, neuregulin 1 promotes actin-dependent NMDAR \ninternalization and decreases NMDAR-mediated EPSCs (109). While similar studies \nin hippocampal neurons report neuregulin-1-mediated decreases in AMPAR-\nmediated EPSCs, not NMDAR EPSCs, and a corresponding increase in AMPAR \nendocytosis (164), these data support a role for glutamatergic regulation by \nneuregulins. Furthermore, analysis in postmortem brain tissue of schizophrenic pa-\ntients identified a more tightly coupled complex of the neuregulin receptor ErbB4, \nPSD-95, and NMDARs than in normal controls (111). Neuregulin 1 activity sup-\npresses NMDAR activation, an effect that is more pronounced in schizophrenic \nsubjects than in normal controls (111). These data, therefore, suggest that the effects \nof neuregulins on NMDAR function may be related to the glutamatergic hypofunc-\ntion model. \n \nMajor depression and bipolar disorder have been linked to the glutamatergic \nsystem, largely as a result of effective treatment of these diseases with antagonists of \nNMDARs (384). Notably, subjects with major depressive disorder exhibited signifi-\ncant improvements following a single dose of the NMDAR-specific antagonist \nketamine (385). Furthermore, mice lacking the NR2A subunit exhibit anxiolytic and \nantidepressant-like effects (27). Exercise in NR2A knockout mice does not enhance \nneurogenesis as in wild-type mice (151), in agreement with the model that depres-\nsion may result from impaired neurogenesis (17). Treatment of rats with lithium, an \neffective treatment for bipolar disorder, results in block of NMDAR-mediated signal-\ning via phopholipase A2 activation and arachadonic acid release (15). As in schizo-\nphrenia, alterations in NR1, NR2A, NR2B, and, interestingly, NR3A subunit expres-\nsion have been reported for bipolar disorder and depression (158, 207, 229, 370)."}

Bulk ap-\nproaches, i.e. probing large numbers (fifty to few hundreds) of molecules simultane-\nously has permitted the observation of dynamic reorganization of synaptic compo-\nnents, and this has challenged the notion that synapses are stable entities. However, \nthese approaches did not allow the behavior of individual molecules to be followed. \nThe first single molecule technique to be used in synaptic biology was patch-clamp \nrecordings measuring the electrophysiological properties of individual ion channels. \nThis approach, though powerful, does not allow for a determination of the spatial \ndistribution of a given molecule over time. As trafficking of molecular components \nhas emerged as a major pathway in the regulation of synapse function, the field was \nsearching for means to investigate the microscopic behavior of molecules with high \nspatio-temporal resolution. Once the concept was established that synaptic molecules \nare in movement, it was implicit that they are in reversible interactions in a short \ntime scale (i.e. receptor scaffold interactions). \n \nThe recent developments in single molecule imaging technologies are now lead-\ning to wide applications in cellular biology allowing for the unraveling of new \nmechanisms related to molecular movements. These advances were made possible \nby a combination of improvements in optical detectors combined with new molecu-\nlar tagging strategies and the advent of biocompatible nanotechnological tools. \n \nSingle molecule imaging has been critical for synaptic biology since molecules \ntraffic between microdomains with specific molecular composition. In recent years, \nfluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP, e.g. (3, 143)) and single particle \ntracking (SPT, see (142)) have revealed that synaptic molecules move and change \ndiffusive behavior over short time scales.

Receptors are synthe-\nsized mainly in the cell body but possibly also in dendrites (67) and then trafficked intracellu-\nlarly along dendrites by microtubule based vesicular transport. There is debate (1, 100–102) \non the site of insertion of receptors that could occur at the cell body (1), along dendrites (102), \nwithin the spine (100, 101), or even directly at the PSD (52). Receptor endocytosis occurs \nperi-synaptically. On the other hand, most receptors constantly move in and out synapses by \nlateral diffusion within the plane of the membrane. Receptors trafficking into and out of syn-\napses thus rely on sequential and complementary routes involving diffusion, endo- and exocy-\ntosis. \n \nMultiple studies have shown that AMPAR localization is a very dynamic process, \nwith AMPARs cycling in and out of synapses under a variety of situations related to \nsynaptic plasticity and development (e.g. (12, 46, 78, 84, 86, 129, 145)). Similarly, \nNMDARs also cycle in and out synapses, albeit at slower rates (reviewed in (74)). \n3.1 Exocytosis \nOne of the last steps in the long journey of receptors to the synapse is their delivery \ninto the specialized dendritic membrane that constitutes the postsynaptic terminal. \nExocytosis of receptors is not only required for insertion of new receptors in basal \nconditions but appears to be also required for LTP (81, 100).

As previously described, subunit-\nspecific functions govern the synaptic delivery of AMPARs in hippocampal slice \ncultures (61, 124, 148) and in dissociated cultures (102). The sites of receptor exocy-\ntosis, either coming from a pool of newly synthesized receptors (67) or from a pool \nof recycling receptors, still remains elusive. Excitatory or inhibitory receptors could \nbe either directly exocytozed at the synapse, as suggested by recent work (52), or \nfirst exocytosed in the extrasynaptic membrane and followed by their lateral diffu-\nsion at the neuronal surface and trapping at synaptic sites. This was shown initially \nby using cleavable extracellular epitope tags on transfected receptors. These studies \n(102, 113) have suggested that glycine receptor and AMPARs can be inserted at the \nsoma or along dendrites followed by their lateral translocation to synaptic sites. This \napproach indicated that receptors diffuse along dendrites with a linear speed of about \n1 µm/min (113). For AMPA receptors, it was established that the surface insertion of \nAMPARs occurs along dendrites in a subunit-dependent manner (102). Surface in-\nsertion of the GluR1 subunit occurs slowly in basal conditions and is stimulated by \nNMDAR activation (see also (105)) and insulin, whereas GluR2 exocytosis is consti-\ntutively rapid. Although both subunits ultimately concentrate in synapses, GluR2 \naccumulation at synapses is faster than that of GluR1 suggesting that either GluR1 is \ninserted initially at extrasynaptic sites while GluR2 is inserted more directly at syn-\napses or that both receptors are inserted at extrasynaptic sites but that GluR2 diffuses \nfaster in the membrane and can thus accumulate faster in synapses. The rapid accu-\nmulation of newly exocytosed GluR2 subunits at synaptic sites was found to depend \non the NSF binding sites in the C terminus of GluR2 (14). Similar dendritic insertion \nof AMPAR subunits was found in other studies using different types of epitope tags \n(bungarotoxin binding site or bi-arsenical dyes) (67, 120). \n \nStudies on native AMPARs found that LTP was accompanied by a rapid insertion \nof native AMPARs and by increased clustering of AMPARs at the surface of den-\ndritic membranes. AMPAR insertion was blocked by intracellular tetanus toxin, \nproviding evidence that AMPARs are inserted into excitatory synapses via a \nSNARE-dependent exocytosis during LTP (82). Real-time measurements of receptor \nexocytosis onto the surface of neurons have recently been made possible through the \nuse of green fluorescent protein (GFP) variants that display strong pH-dependent \nfluorescence (ecliptic pHluorins) (91). Using this assay, it has been shown that \nchemically induced LTP rapidly enhances spine size with subsequent surface incor-\nporation of GluR1 AMPARs by exocytosis from intracellular sites. GluR1 receptors \nincrease on spine surfaces with no significant net change on the nearby dendrite. \nGluR2 receptors increase moderately and transiently on the spine surface (69). Al-\nthough the exact site of exocytosis could not be determined, the absence of change in \nnet dendritic signal may suggest that there is no significant net shift of receptors \nfrom dendritic surface to spine surface. However, a small amount of lateral move-\nment from dendrite to spines could have been missed due to the large amount of \ndendritic surface receptors. A recent study on the role of components of the exocyst \ncomplex in AMPAR delivery have suggested that Exo70 mediates AMPAR insertion \ndirectly within the postsynaptic density, rather than at extrasynaptic membranes (52). \nMost interestingly, recent results indicate that LTP-inducing stimuli promote the"}

Adesnik et al. used a photo-\nreactive AMPAR antagonist (6-azido-7-nitro-1,4-dihydroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, \nANQX) (1, 29). Its global or focal photoactivation (by UV light) allows for meas-\nurement of the recovery of currents after specific inactivation of all or a sub-\npopulation of surface AMPARs. The turn-over rate of synaptic receptors with intra-\ncellular pools was found to be surprisingly slow, in the time scale of several hours, \ndiffering from previous results. In contrast, AMPARs were shown to be rapidly \nexocytosed to the plasma membrane in the somatic compartment. Importantly it was \nalso found that somatic surface AMPARs diffuse laterally at high rate. Thus, it is \npossible that new functional AMPARs in the dendrites come from receptors exocyto-\nsed at the soma and traveling down dendrites by lateral diffusion. This model is \nhowever hard to reconcile with the wealth of data that has shown AMPARs recycling \nin dendrites and it is improbable that receptors are delivered to distal dendrites purely \nby diffusion at the neuronal surface as this would take extended periods of time (a \nfew to several hours per 100 µm is an optimistic estimate). Moreover, it is not clear \nhow this model fits with electrophysiological measurements indicating an increasing \ngradient of AMPA receptors as one moves proximally to distally in CA1 pyramidal \nneurons. \n \nIn contrast to the flurry of information on AMPARs, much less is known regard-\ning the exocytosis of NMDARs. Interactions between SAP102 and Sec8 are involved \nin the delivery of NMDARs to the cell surface in heterologous cells and neurons \n(115). \n3.2 Endocytosis \nAMPARs undergo rapid constitutive internalization that is regulated by synaptic \nactivity (46, 78). For NMDARs, constitutive internalization in mature neurons is \nslow relative to AMPARs and not regulated by activity but is rapid in immature \nneurons (46, 78, 112). Although NMDA receptors are thought to be relatively stable \nduring synaptic plasticity, certain stimuli can induce their acute internalization (96, \n129). Mounting evidence suggests that the internalization of glutamate receptors is a \nprimary mechanism of long-term depression (LTD) (12, 78, 86, 129, 145), wherein a \nspecific stimulus causes a decrease in synaptic strength (11). Upon internalization, \nAMPARs are sorted in early endosomes either to a specialized recycling endosome \ncompartment for reinsertion to the plasma membrane or to late endosomes and ly-\nsosomes for degradation (46, 75). \n \nWhere are the endocytosis sites? Glutamate receptor internalization is thought to \noccur through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (12, 28, 46, 78, 86, 145). An endocytic \nzone at the postsynaptic side of excitatory synapses, segregated from the postsynap-\ntic density (PSD), is thought to be the site of internalization for synaptic proteins, \nincluding glutamate receptors (17). Electron microscopy has shown the presence of \nclathrin-coated pits and vesicles in dendritic spines (36, 104, 131, 139). In young \nneurons, clathrin assembly and disassembly occur rapidly, locally, and repeatedly at \n“hot spots” throughout dendrites and at the tips of dendritic filopodia (17). In"}
{"text": "===== Page 6 =====\n374 \nD. Choquet and A. Triller \n \ncontrast, clathrin coats in mature dendrites reside in stable, long-lasting zones at sites \nof endocytosis, where clathrin undergoes continuous exchange with local cytosolic \ndevelop and persist independently of synaptic activity, akin to the PSD itself (17). \n \nProteins mediating endocytosis are systematically arrayed within dendritic \nspines, tangential to the synapse (108). While the disruption of components of the \ngeneral endocytic machinery has been shown to disrupt glutamate receptor internali-\nzation (27, 83, 89, 147), CPG2 is a protein that was recently shown to be specifically \ninvolved in the internalization of postsynaptic proteins. CPG2 is a component of the \npostsynaptic endocytic pathway that mediates both constitutive and activity-\nregulated glutamate receptor internalization (37). CPG2 localizes to an endocytic \nzone of excitatory synapses. CPG2 knockdown disrupts constitutive AMPAR and \nNMDAR internalization and activity-induced AMPAR internalization. Since CPG2 \nis primarily localized to the postsynaptic endocytic zone of excitatory synapses, it is \nnot a constitutive part of the ubiquitous endocytic machinery. In CPG2 knockdown \nneurons, there is an increase in synaptic glutamate receptors, which is likely due to \nthe disruption of glutamate receptor endocytosis. Although some reports have indi-\ncated that endocytosis inhibition does not affect the number of surface AMPARs (81, \n86), this data is consistent with results showing that acute blockade of endocytosis \ncauses an increase in synaptic transmission (83). These ultrastructural data are cor-\nroborated by direct imaging of removal of AMPARs from synapses showing that it is \npreceded by transient endocytosis of extrasynaptic AMPARs. Ecliptic pHluorin-\ntagged GluR2 has been used to visualize changes in AMPAR surface expression in \nreal time. Synaptic and extrasynaptic AMPARs respond very differently to NMDAR \nactivation; there is a rapid internalization of extrasynaptic AMPARs that precedes \nthe delayed removal of synaptic AMPARs (2). \n4 Approaches to Track Receptor Mobility \nExperimental studies of diffusion of particles have originally been carried out by \nusing methods that measure the average behaviour of an entire population, such as \ndynamic light scattering (15) or neutron scattering (62) in physics, or FRAP (110) or \nfluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) (6) commonly used in biology. Bulk \nmeasurements using FRAP demonstrated long ago that biological membranes are \nfluid mosaics (5). Early on, this was recognized to be also true for neuronal mem-\nbranes (e.g. (68)). However, single molecule techniques have only recently been \napplied in neuroscience (39, 133). \n \nFor twenty years, optical methods have been developed for observing the motion \nof molecules through the use of single particle imaging (51, 117). These methods, \nreferred to as SPT methods, rely on following the trajectory of a marker attached to \nthe diffusing molecule. Transport properties of the particle are then derived through a \nstatistical analysis of the trajectory, which includes measurement of the mean square \ndisplacement. \n \nVisualisation of the diffusive behaviour of single membrane proteins in living \ncells has revealed that these molecules undergo a variety of motions, such as \nBrownian, confined, or directed (70, 117). In this context, SPT is a powerful tool for \npools (17). In dendritic spines, endocytic zones lie laterally to the PSD where they"}

In this approach, mole-\ncules of interest are tagged with a fluorophore (e.g. fluorescent irreversible antago-\nnist or antibody). A small area of the cell is quickly photobleached using an intense \nexcitation light and the rate of fluorescence recovery in the excited spot is monitored \nover time. The fluorescence recovery depends on protein mobility from the area \nsurrounding the bleached spot. This technique only gives averaged estimates of pro-\ntein mobility, as the movements of many molecules are measured simultaneously \nand derivation of diffusion coefficients are based on assumption on bleaching beam \nprofile and membrane isotropy. Further, it has limited spatial resolution (~250 nm). \nThe relationship between FRAP and single molecule tracking is discussed below. \n4.2 Single Particle and Molecule Tracking \nThe emergence of single particle tracking experiments allowed real-time monitoring \nof the movement of individual or small groups of proteins (Fig. 2). In SPT ap-\nproaches, submicrometer-sized particles are bound to the protein of interest, such as \nneurotransmitter receptors, through ligands that recognize the extracellular domain \n(7, 21, 33, 70, 117). Particles vary in composition, size and in the optical method \nused for their detection. \n \nThe advent of fluorescence imaging in the 1990s together with the improvement \nof charge-coupled device (CCD) camera sensitivity allowed the detection of single \nfluorophores in living cells. Organic dyes were the first fluorescent probes to be used \nand present the advantages of being small (<1 nm), easily coupled to ligands by \nsimple chemistry and amenable to multicolor detection. However their use is limited \nby their rapid (few seconds) photobleaching. \n \nTo gather sufficient photons to image one dye molecule, the preparation must be \nexcited at saturation through a defocused laser. However, this substantially acceler-\nates the photobleaching, and thus single dye molecules can usually be imaged for \nonly few seconds (at 30 Hz rate acquisition). Thus, the single molecule detection \napproach provides the advantage of small probe size that enters confined spaces but \nhas the disadvantage of a limited tracking time. An alternative approach, FCS, has \nbeen developed. Using FCS, the mobility of individual fluorescent molecules is \nmeasured as their residence time in a small illumination volume. The faster mole-\ncules diffuse, the shorter their residence time is in the excitation volume. As with \nFRAP, this approach gives measurements of the population mobility. Furthermore, it \nis limited to the measurement of rapidly moving molecules, as the fluorophore must \nremain active during the whole period of residence in the measurement volume and \nnot photobleach."}

These links can be used to \nrecognize endogenous unmodified receptors, or receptor subunits modified geneti-\ncally or chemically to add a target tag. \n \nAdequate linkers between the probes and the studied molecules must fulfill some \nprerequisites: linkers have to bind extracellular domains of receptors in living cells \nwithout modifying their function; linker affinity has to be in the nanomolar range to \nensure stability of the receptor-linker-probe complex.

{"text": "===== Page 10 =====\n378 \nD. Choquet and A. Triller \n \n \nThese requisites are met differently for the various ligands. In the central nervous \nsystem, there are only few natural ligands which can be used, mainly because their \naffinities are too low or because chemical modifications needed for their coupling to \nthe probes destroys their binding properties. In most cases only antibodies are avail-\nable for recognition. Specific tagging of receptors is best achieved using artificial \ntags added chemically or genetically allowing the use of excellent ligands. Various \nstrategies have been used with success: epitope tags (88, 121), biotin tags (64), toxin \nbinding sites (120), polyhistidine-NTA (73), cysteine modification (130). The link-\ning to the probe (a dye or a nano particle) is performed either by passive adsorption \nor by covalent linkage. For single molecule tracking it is usually straightforward to \nchemically link an organic fluophore. Fluorescent proteins (XFPs) represent a spe-\ncific case in which the fluorophores are directly genetically encoded with the studied \nprotein. However, the poor signal to noise ratio yielded by these natural fluorophores \nmake them of difficult use for SMT (32). The recent progress in fluorescence excita-\ntion procedures (44) may open the track to a new era for SMT of XFPs. \n \nIn the case of particles, the situation is more complex as complexation of the \nligand to the probe can alter the physical properties of one or the other. Interesting \nnew directions lie is the direct binding of peptides to gold or QD nanoparticles, al-\nlowing for marked decrease in the hydrodynamic radii of the probe-linker complex. \nIn any case, the main hurdles appear to be the nonspecific binding of the probe to \nbiological sample and the control of the stoichiometry of the probe-linker-target \ncomplex. Indeed, while it is relatively easy to ascertain a one-to-one labelling ratio of \nreceptor to organic dyes, it is much more difficult to do it with functionalized parti-\ncles. \n4.5 Effect of Label Size on Diffusion and Trafficking of Surface \nReceptors \nParticle or molecule movement, and therefore diffusion of the underlying receptors, \nis imaged by video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy or fluo-\nrescence imaging. The relative position of the particle is then measured with good \naccuracy (in the 10 nm range). In open spaces, the size of the tag only marginally \ninfluences the membrane protein movements, which are dominated by Brownian and \nviscous forces, because membrane viscosity is approximately 500-fold greater than \nthat of extracellular fluids. The membrane-anchored receptors thus slow down the \nparticles and not the opposite. This is of course only true when the probe diffusion is \nnot hindered by extracellular molecular obstacles or narrow spaces between cells. \nAnother issue lies in the difficulty to determine whether a given tracked particle \nremains at the cell surface and/or interferes with the endocytosis of the bound recep-\ntor. On the one hand, the available particles do not report a surface versus intracellu-\nlar localization and the optical resolution does not permit an unambiguous determi-\nnation of this localization. Incorporation of pH sensitive dyes in particles may allow \ndetecting internalization events through the normal acidification of the luminal do-\nmain within the endocytotic vesicles (128). On the other hand, there are few pub-\nlished data that have studied the impact of particles on the endocytic process (26)."}

However access to \nmore intact systems (tissue slices and in vivo) has still resisted investigations at the \nsingle molecule level. A few recent reports have analyzed the dynamics of synaptic \nmolecules in slices or in vivo using the FRAP approach (53). Interestingly, the dy-\nnamics which have been measured are only mildly quantitatively different from \nthose found in neuronal culture. Two elements are detrimental to measurements of \nsingle molecules in tissue: the size of the probe, and light diffraction which imposes \nthe need for a large number of photons. Measurement of diffusion volumes in brain \nslices indicate that probes with hydrodynamic diameters of 5–10 nm may be used to \ntrack receptors (136). The need for a high photon yield being already satisfied by \nQDs or metallic nanoparticles, development for small functionalizing linkers remain \nthe main obstacle. In addition, rapid 3-D tracking is still to be developed. Altogether, \ntracking individual receptors in tissue slices is the next challenge that now seems to \nbe within reach. \n4.7 Pointing Accuracy \nAn important advantage of SPT and SMT approaches lies in their high pointing \naccuracy that allows localisation of the tracked object below the optical diffraction \nlimits reaching in the best case few nanometers. This property results from the fact \nthat pixel sizes are images of areas smaller than the point spread function of the \noptical pathway (PSF) and are intensity coded. The center of gravity of the image of \nthe PSF on the CCD is a good approximation of the localization of the source and \ncan be computed with a precision where signal variance is dominated by photon \nnoise and varies according to the inverse square root of photon numbers. This im-\nplies that the more photon is gathered the better is the pointing accuracy. The latter \nbeing given by: \n \nwhere λem, na, γ, A, and t denote the emission wavelength of the single molecule, the \nnumerical aperture of the objective, the efficiency of the optical system, the emission \nrate of the single molecule and the acquisition time, respectively (98) \n \nTrajectories are reconstructed from sequences of images of single particles or \nmolecules. First, single objects must be detected in the images. That a single object is \ndetected is ascertained according to the adequate characteristics of each probe. In the \ncase of micron-sized latex beads, the center of gravity of the image is used to posi-\ntion the object. In the case of single fluorophores such as organic dyes or QDs, the \nobject is smaller than the diffraction limit and thus its image corresponds to the point \nspread function of the optical system. Single organic dyes are recognized by one step \nphoto-bleaching while single QD are identified by their fluorescence intermittency. \nFluorescent spots are detected by cross-correlating the image with a Gaussian model"}

A least-squares Gaussian fit is applied (around the local \nmaximum above a threshold) to determine the center of each spot with a spatial \naccuracy of 5–10 nm (depending on the signal-to-noise ratio). This is applied succes-\nsively to each frame of the sequence. \n \nThe pointing accuracy is different from the resolution, which is the ability to \nseparate two objects. Single nano object imaging display the standard optical resolu-\ntion given by half the light wavelength. Other techniques (see below) aim at breaking \nthis diffraction limit. This is at the origin of the difficulty to assert colocalization of a \nsingle molecule with a bulk labelling (e.g. a synaptic stain) because strictly speaking \nthe resolution is not improved. In case of multiple single nano-object markers, the \nuse of pointing accuracy allows for the indirect improvement in resolution, breaking \nthe diffraction limit, as recently applied in the PALM technique (16). \n4.8 Trajectory Reconstruction and Analysis \nAfter nano-object detection, trajectories are assembled automatically by linking, \nfrom frame to frame, the centers of fluorescent spots likely arising from the same \nprobe (7, 21, 32). The association criterion is based on the assumption of free \nBrownian diffusion, and takes into account short blinking events in the case of QDs. \nFor analysis, the following parameters can be calculated from the reconstructed \ntrajectories: (1) The mean square displacement (117), which allows one to character-\nize the movement (directed, free Brownian or confined), (2) the diffusion coefficient \n(71) which characterizes the speed of molecular displacement; (3) the confinement \narea (71, 30) which measure the space in which a molecule diffuses with a given \nmotion type; and (4) the rotational diffusion (58) that depend on the shape and inter-\nactions of the diffusing object. These physical parameters give access to the proper-\nties of the followed molecule that diffuses in a given molecular environment. It al-\nlows important elements to be characterized such as molecular interactions (e.g. \nreceptors with scaffold molecules), or diffusional restriction due to local molecular \ncrowding. \n4.9 Transition Between Compartments and Dwell Time  \nWithin a Compartment \nSpecial compartments such as synapses can be labelled with fluorescent dyes. Over-\nlaying the image of a compartment marker with the QD-trajectory allows the transi-\ntions of a QD-labelled molecule in and out synapses to be directly observed (7, 30, \n39). Transitions between compartments, dwell time, and the average diffusion coef-\nficient within a compartment can thus be estimated from the trajectory (30). \n \nIt is immediately observable from individual trajectories that molecule diffusion \ndisplays spatial and temporal heterogeneities (Fig. 3). Refining the analysis indicate \nthat molecules alternate between states with different diffusional properties follow-\ning Markovian rules. This results either from intrinsic properties of the receptor or \nfrom reversible interactions with its immediate environment.

{"text": "compartmentalization results from the existence of corrals formed by membrane \nproteins anchored to a submembranous cytoskeleton network. This heterogeneity, \nwhether structured or not, dynamic or not, affects the diffusion of proteins in the \nmembrane. This heterogeneity can be quantified by a characteristic length below \nwhich the membrane is homogenous and does not contain any obstacle/trap for the \ndiffusing protein. \n \nProperties of diffusion within a compartment are characterized by several pa-\nrameters such as the instantaneous diffusion coefficient, the degree of confinement \nand the dwell time. In neurons, the instantaneous diffusion of receptors spans several \norders of magnitude but is within the same range inside and outside synapses, indi-\ncating that receptors can reach comparable slow and high instantaneous speeds in \nboth compartments. Yet, the averaged movements are strikingly different in synaptic \nand extrasynaptic domains. Movements in synapses are confined within submicron \ndomains while they are free and Brownian outside synapses. As a result, extrasynap-\ntic receptors can travel much longer distances. \n4.10 Bulk Versus Single Molecule Measurements \nAlthough detailed analysis of the trajectories of individual molecules can yield con-\nsiderably precise information, the representativeness of the measures can always be \nbiased by sampling and labeling procedures. Therefore, single molecule data cannot \nbe interpreted without knowledge of the population behavior. The most common \nbulk approach to receptor movements is FRAP. Both FRAP and SPT are different \nviews of the same phenomenon which is related to the movement and immobiliza-\ntion of receptors entering and exiting a defined subdomain. However the interpreta-\ntion of FRAP data and extraction of pertinent parameters such as diffusion coeffi-\ncients, dwell times and confinement requires multiple and hidden assumptions while \nsingle molecule tracking directly provides these parameters (63). \n \nFRAP experiments consist of bleaching tagged receptors in a specific region, \nsuch as the PSD, and measuring the time it takes for unbleached receptors to fill the \nbleached area. The recovery process depends on different molecular events such as \nthe lateral diffusion of unbleached receptors into the PSD, which depends on both \ntheir availability and mobility, and the exit of bleached receptors from the PSD, \nwhich depends on both their mobility and unbinding from scaffolding molecule. \nThe recovery curves depend on different parameters such as the geometrical charac-\nteristics of the bleached spot, the flux of incoming receptors in the bleached area, and \nthe total number of binding sites. From the recovery curves, two main parameters \ncan be recovered, the time constant of recovery and the amount of recovery once \nsteady state is reached, otherwise called mobile fraction. \n \nThe time constant of recovery depends on the incoming flux which itself depends \non gradients creating a chemical potential and on the mobility of the molecules.

Variations of FRAP approaches such as FRAP at varying \nradius (114) or FLIP (fluorescence loss in photobleaching (79)) can however facili-\ntate this correlation. \n4.11 The Next Challenge: Live Imaging of Receptor Trafficking in Slices \nTracking individual receptors in primary neuronal cultures has now been achieved in \nmany labs, and all the studies have confirmed the highly dynamic nature of mem-\nbrane protein organization. However the access to more intact systems (slices and in \nvivo) has resisted single molecule investigations. A few recent reports have analyzed \nthe dynamic of synaptic molecules in slices or in vivo using FRAP approach (53). \nInterestingly the dynamics which have been measured are nearly identical to those \nfound in culture. Two elements are detrimental to measurements of single molecules \nin tissues: the size of the probe, and the light diffraction which impose large number \nof photons. Further improvements in probe size and quantum yield are likely to al-\nlow single particle tracking in tissue slices in a foreseeable future. \n5 Diffusion Properties of Neuronal Membranes: Differences  \nand Similarities Between Synaptic and Extrasynaptic Membranes \nNeuronal membranes are not homogeneous environments for diffusion and barriers \nto diffusion have been described at several levels. The distribution of proteins, such \nas the neurotransmitter receptors and voltage-gated channels, at the neuronal surface \nis highly compartmentalized. The most striking example of such compartmentaliza-\ntion in neurons is between the somatodentritic and axonal compartments. A diffusion \nbarrier is present in the cell membrane of the axonal initial segment (AIS), which \nseparates the somatodendritic domain and the axon domains. It is formed by the \naccumulation of proteins anchored to the dense membrane skeleton which function \nas rows of pickets, which even stop the overall diffusion of phospholipids (94, 146). \nNeurons control polarized delivery of membrane proteins to each domain, and in \naddition, this diffusion barrier could block diffusion mixing of proteins between \nthese domains. At a smaller scale, the synapse is a sub-compartment where neuro-\ntransmitter receptors are concentrated and confined within the postsynaptic mem-\nbrane. \n \nBecause of the high heterogeneity of the neuronal membrane, that varies in space \nand time, diffusion coefficients of receptors span several orders of magnitude, rang-\ning from the immobile within detection limits (below 10–3 µm2/s) to very mobile  \n(1 µm2/s). It is noteworthy that this value is still lower than that expected form a \ntransmembrane protein diffusing in a pure lipid bilayer. \n \nEarly on, it was recognized that diffusion rates of excitatory and inhibitory recep-\ntors varies extensively over time (88, 121), switching often (within seconds) and \nabruptly between states of rapid sow movements as the receptors explored the den-\ndritic space. These observations provided additional evidence for the spatial hetero-\ngeneity of the neuronal membrane and indicated that molecules can exchange be-\ntween compartments. Further studies indicated that states of low mobilities were"}

Triller \n \npreferentially, although not exclusively, associated with the presence of receptors \nover clusters of scaffolding molecules or synaptic sites. An important point to raise is \nthat analysis of the exchange of receptors between optically resolved compartments \nis limited by the diffraction limit of visible light used in optical microscopy. As a \nconsequence, receptor trajectories can only be ascertained to correspond to an opti-\ncally identified compartment with a precision of around 250 nm. Importantly, the \ndynamic signature of movements that is obtained with a sub-diffraction resolution in \neach compartment verifies that receptors diffuse in specific environments. The diffu-\nsional properties that characterize a compartment are (1) the distribution of the \nspeeds (instantaneous diffusion rate) at which molecules move within the compart-\nment (2) the size of the compartment, (3) the dwell time of the molecule within the \ncompartment. The global diffusion rate, averaged over all time intervals and obtained \nby fitting the whole MSD curve instead of the initial slope, provides a mean value of \nreceptor diffusion and can be related to the rate of recovery obtained in FRAP ex-\nperiments. All these parameters are calculated from trajectories and the derived MSD \nfunction. \n \nTo date, most studies have concentrated on the specific diffusional differences \nthat exist between synaptic and extrasynaptic domains (3, 30, 39, 47, 56, 133). Gen-\nerally speaking, and at first glance, the differences between these two domains ap-\npear surprisingly minor. For AMPARs, the percentage of immobile receptors is only \nabout two fold larger in synaptic versus extrasynaptic domains. Similarly, the median \ninstantaneous diffusion coefficients are about two fold smaller in synapses. In strik-\ning contrast, the level of confinement is very different in both compartments. While \nreceptors display free Brownian diffusion in extrasynaptic domains, traveling several \nmicrons per minute, they display confined diffusion in synapses, their movement \nbeing rapid, but restricted to a sub-domain of a few hundreds of nanometer perfectly \nco-localized with synaptic markers (Fig. 3). As a consequence, receptors dwell pro-\nportionally for longer times in a synaptic than an extra-synaptic area. These findings \nobtained by single molecule measurements are translated in FRAP experiments by \nslower rates of recovery and a higher immobile fraction in synapses. \n \nSpine shape might be another regulator of receptor diffusion. Spine necks likely \nact as passive filters that help maintaining recycling receptors in the spine head \n(100). In mammalian excitatory neurons, dendritic spines are separated from den-\ndrites by thin necks. Diffusion across the neck limits the chemical and electrical \nisolation of each spine. The neck also represents a barrier to membrane (111) and \nvolume (18) diffusion and these barriers seem to be bi-directionally regulated by \nneuronal activity. Glutamate receptors activation regulates the mobility of molecules \nin the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane through an action upon the actin cy-\ntoskeleton, suggesting a mechanism for the regulation of postsynaptic receptor den-\nsity and composition. The regulation of spine/dendrite diffusional equilibration may \nhave several functional consequences as the susceptibility of individual synapses to \nplasticity induction may be influenced by the ability of signalling molecules and \nreceptors to move into and out of the spine head (3). This reinforces the control of \nthe autonomy of the synapses on spines by isolating the spine head as an individual \ndiffusion domain (63)."}
{"text": "===== Page 17 =====\nSurface Trafficking of Membrane Proteins at Excitatory and Inhibitory Synapses\n385\n \n \n \n \nWhat might be the biological basis for corralling in synapses? Obviously, intra-\ncellular scaffold and cytoskeletal elements, transmembrane adhesion proteins, and \nextracellular matrix are candidates. The differentiating feature between these obsta-\ncle molecules lies in whether they act as specific binding sites for the receptors (e.g. \nPSD-95 for stargazin or gephyrin for GlyRs) or participate in overall crowding of the \nsynapse acting as posts to slow receptor movements. As for elements participating in \nspecific binding, the affinity and avidity of the receptor-target interaction will deter-\nmine the residency time of the interaction. When the target is itself immobile, for \ncentage of time receptors remain immobile within the PSD. Interestingly, residency \ntimes of receptors in clusters or synapses, whether AMPARs, mGluRs, GlyRs, or \nGABARs, follow distributions that cannot be fit by monoexponential functions and \nthus very likely do not follow a simple reaction rate kinetic with one bound and one \nunbound state (88, 121). This further suggests that receptor-binder interactions gen-\nerate multiple states of distinct stability and could also indicate that receptor sub-\npopulations move in and out synapses with different rate constants. \n \nThe PSD itself is most likely to have a spatially heterogenous structure. Immuno-\nelectron microscopy has suggested that some molecules display anisotropic colocali-\nzation in the PSD. For example the adhesion protein cadherin and mGluR1/5 have \nbeen reported to lie laterally in the PSD. Classical EM however has a limited label-\ning efficacy, thus questioning the significance of these observations. Recent ad-\nvanced cryo-immunoelectron microscopy associated with partial solubilization of \nfreeze-fracture replicates (87) has demonstrated a near 100% labeling efficacy (132) \nand has demonstrated a concentration of AMPARs in a few tens of nanometer sized \nwithin the PSD at most cerebellar synapses, while the remaining ones display diffuse \nstaining for AMPARs. Interestingly, high resolution single QD tracking has revealed \nthat AMPARs are confined in 50 nm areas at active synapses while they explore the \nwhole PSD at silenced synapses (47). Altogether, these data indicate that the PSD \nmay bear subdomains in which receptors are more stable than others.

The percentage of time and the properties of each individual state vary con-\nsiderably from one receptor to the other. Generally speaking, one can assume that the \nstate of free diffusion corresponds to receptors unbound from stabilizing elements \nand moving in relatively non-crowded membrane areas, such as the extrasynaptic \nmembrane. The state of free diffusion is characterized by a linear MSD indicating \nthat the area explored by the receptors increases proportionally with time.

While basal AMPAR diffusion does not seem to \ndepend on subunit composition, NMDARs diffusion strikingly depend on the pres-\nence of NR2A or NR2B subunits (57). While NR2A containing NMDARs are \nlargely immobilized at synaptic sites, with only 20% being in a mobile state at any \ngiven time, NR2B containing NMDARs are rather mobile, albeit at slower rates than \nAMPARs. Triheteromeric NR2A/NR2B/NR1 containing NMDARs likely behave as \ndiheteromeric NR2A/NR1 NMDARs (57). The synaptic composition of NMDARs \nchanges over maturation with an increase in the NR2A/NR2B subunit ratio (92, 122, \n134, 140). Interestingly, the developmental switch in the synaptic NR2A- and \nNR2B-containing NMDAR surface distribution correlates with developmental \nchanges in the time spent by subunits within synapses (54). This suggests that the \nswitch in synaptic NMDAR subtypes depends on the regulation of receptor surface \ntrafficking. Regarding AMPARs, a global decrease in surface diffusion is observed \nduring synaptic development (20, 55), but receptors can still diffuse in and out of \nmature spines (3, 8). \n6.2 Glycine, GABA and Other Receptors \nUsing latex beads and SPT, glycine receptors (88) where the first to be shown to be \nmobile in plane of the neuronal plasma membrane and to exchange between clusters \nof gephyrin (its scaffold protein) through lateral diffusion. Quantum dots were used \nto track individual glycine receptors (GlyRs) and to analyze their lateral dynamics in \nthe neuronal membrane of living cells for periods ranging from milliseconds to min-\nutes (39). This allowed the characterization of multiple diffusion domains in relation \nto the synaptic, perisynaptic, or extrasynaptic GlyR localization. The median diffu-\nsion rate in the plane of the plasma membrane was in the range of 10–1–10–2µm2/s in \nthe extracellular space, and 10–3 µm2/s or below at synapses. The entry of GlyRs into \nthe synapse by diffusion could also be observed and further confirmed by electron \nmicroscopy imaging of QD-tagged receptors. A careful analysis of the diffusive \nproperties further revealed that the receptor scaffold interaction is rather complex \nand results from multiple association states (48). \n \nThe dynamics of GABAA receptor mobility between synaptic and extrasynaptic \nlocations in hippocampal pyramidal neurons has also been established by FRAP using \nfluorescent GABAA receptors that are capable of binding α-bungarotoxin (Bgt) (19) \nand by introducing a binding site for an irreversible inhibitor into the GABAA receptor \nalpha1 subunit channel lining region that can be accessed only when the receptor is \nactivated (135). These studies established that the synaptic receptor population turns \nover rapidly by the import of new functional receptors within minutes through receptor \ndiffusion within the plane of the membrane rather than trafficking from intracellular \npools. Imaging with Bgt in hippocampal neurons revealed that GABAA receptor endo-\ncytosis occurred exclusively at extrasynaptic sites, consistent with the preferential \ncolocalization of extrasynaptic receptors with the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex."}

Using organotypic culture from \nrat striatum transfected with D1R fused to a fluorescent protein, the majority of den-\ndritic D1R has been shown to diffuse laterally (118). NMDA receptors can act as a \nscaffold to recruit laterally diffusing dopamine D1 receptors (D1R) to neuronal \nspines. Human mu opiod receptors have been shown to diffuse in permeable sub-\nmicrometer sized domains (40, 116). The cell surface dynamics of the 5HT1A recep-\ntor is modulated in a G protein-dependent manner (107). The movement of the hu-\nman odorant receptor OR17-40 has been monitored in living cells by ensemble and \nsingle-molecule imaging. Although mobile receptors initially diffused either freely \nor within domains of various sizes, binding of an agonist or an antagonist increased \npartitioning of receptors into small domains of approximately 190 nm, which likely \nare precursors of clathrin-coated pits (66). \n7 Receptor Scaffold Interactions and Cytoskeleton as Key \nDeterminants of Surface Trafficking \nSynapses contain over 300 types of proteins (65, 103), including neurotransmitter \nreceptors, adhesion proteins and intracellular scaffolding, cytoskeleton or signaling \nelements.

Receptor activation by glutamate increases receptor diffusion, whereas the \nscaffolding protein Homer favours confinement of receptor movements within clus-\nters of Homer-mGluR5. However, this stabilization is reversible, because even in the \npresence of Homer, receptors still enter and exit from clusters at fast rates. Further-\nmore, clusters themselves are highly dynamic both in their movements and in their \ncomposition, which can vary within tens of seconds. These results first demonstrated \nthat the exchange of receptors between dispersed and clustered states is fast and \nregulated during physiological processes and that receptor number in a cluster results \nfrom a dynamic equilibrium between the pools of stabilized and freely mobile recep-\ntors. This suggested that modification of this equilibrium could be involved in regu-\nlation of the number of receptors at synapses and may explain certain fast changes in \nreceptor composition. \n \nMore recently, AMPAR stabilization at excitatory synapses has been shown to be \nmediated by interactions with the AMPAR-associated protein stargazin (95, 149) via \nthe PDZ-domain scaffold protein PSD-95 (8). Using single quantum dot imaging and \nFRAP in live hippocampal neurons, AMPARs were shown to diffuse in the neuronal \nmembrane together with Stargazin and to be trapped reversibly at synapses through \nthe specific binding of stargazin to PSD-95 (Fig. 5). Disruption of the interaction \nbetween stargazin and PSD-95 strongly increased AMPAR surface diffusion, remov-\ning AMPARs from postsynaptic sites. Interestingly, and in contrast, the C-terminal \ndomain of GluR2 does not seem to be involved in controlling AMPAR lateral diffu-\nsion. The direct interaction of the GluR2 C-terminus with the PDZ-containing pro-\nteins ABP/GRIP and PICK1 has been shown to play an important role in the regula-\ntion of AMPARs expression at synaptic sites (reviewed in (35)). These proteins may \nbe involved primarily in modulating the surface expression of AMPARs rather than \nanchoring them at synaptic sites. The GluR2 PDZ-binding motif could be either \nrequired for AMPAR retention in plasma membrane (99) or for receptor recycling at \nthe surface (102). \n \nCytoskeletal elements have also been shown to control receptor diffusion (30). \nPharmacological disruption of F-actin and microtubules decreases the amount of \nGlyR and gephyrin, the backbone of the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold, at syn-\napses. F-actin and microtubule disruption increases GlyR exchange between the \nsynaptic and extrasynaptic membranes and decreases receptor dwell time at synapses \n(Fig. 7). GlyR lateral diffusion is predominantly controlled by microtubules in the \nextrasynaptic membrane and by actin at synapses. Both diffusion coefficients and \nconfinement at synapses are affected after F-actin disruption. These results indicate \nthat receptor exchange between synaptic and extrasynaptic compartments depends on \nthe properties of both the postsynaptic specialization and the extrasynaptic mem-\nbrane. Consequently, GlyR number at synapses may be rapidly modulated by the \ncytoskeleton through the regulation of lateral diffusion in the plasma membrane and \nof receptor stabilization at synapses. In fact, the receptor is not diffusing above a \nstable matrix of gephyrins, and the postsynaptic scaffolds display a submicrometric \nrapid lateral motion continuously moving on the dendritic shaft (59).

These are observed during development \n(synaptogenesis and synaptic maturation) and in the adult. In the last decade, activ-\nity-dependent synaptic plasticity has been shown to rely in large part on changes in \nthe number and subtype of receptors concentrated in synapses (reviewed in (42, 54, \n80, 85)). Surface diffusion of receptors in and out synaptic sites has emerged as a \nmajor mechanism to control these changes and this has fostered the analysis of activ-\nity-dependent regulation of receptor lateral diffusion (31, 142). \n \nAlthough this field is only in its infancy, it is becoming apparent that both excita-\ntory and inhibitory receptor diffusion is strongly and tightly regulated. It was initially \nshown that local rises in intracellular calcium or glutamate uncaging induce a rapid \nand reversible immobilization of AMPARs associated with a local accumulation of \nreceptors (20). Although the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are \nstill unclear, this is likely an important process to locally stabilize AMPARs during \nactivity dependent processes. In contrast, global neuronal depolarization or bath \napplication of glutamate induce an increase in AMPAR mobility (56, 133). This \ncould underlie the loss of synaptic receptors observed during synaptic depression, \nalthough this remains to be established. \n \nBasal synaptic activity was also recently shown to regulate AMPAR accumula-\ntion at synapses (47). Using single-molecule tracking together with the selective \nsilencing of individual presynaptic boutons, local synaptic activity was shown to \nreduce diffusional exchange of GluR1 between synaptic and extrasynaptic domains, \nresulting in the postsynaptic accumulation of GluR1 (Fig. 8). At neighboring inactive \nsynapses, GluR1 is highly mobile with individual receptors frequently escaping the \nsynapse. Within the synapse, spontaneous activity confines the small-scale diffu-\nsional movement of GluR1 to restricted subregions of the postsynaptic membrane. \nThus, local activity restricts GluR1 diffusional mobility on a submicron scale, defin-\ning a novel input-specific mechanism for regulating AMPA receptor composition \nand abundance. \n \nThe molecular mechanisms underlying short- or long-term activity-dependent \nregulation of AMPARs surface trafficking are still unknown but most likely involve \nregulation of interactions between the AMPAR/TARP complex and intracellular \nscaffold proteins. The C-termini of GluR1 and GluR2 have both been extensively \nshown to be involved in activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR numbers at syn-\napses (reviewed in (35, 149)). Alternatively, phosphorylation of the C-terminus of \nTARPs has been shown to bi-directionally regulate synaptic plasticity (138). Deci-\nphering the respective roles of AMPARs and TARPs in synaptic plasticity will un-\ndoubtedly require analyzing their differential involvement in the various trafficking \npathways (lateral diffusion versus recycling) to and from the synapse."}

This leads to the concept that synapses are multimolecular assemblies \nwhose components are in a dynamic equilibrium with the reserve pools of molecules \nin the extrasynaptic membrane and in intracellular compartments (Figs. 6 and 9). The \nnew concept is that synaptic plasticity results from changes in the equilibrium set \npoints rather than all or none addition or removal of receptors. Equilibrium set points \nare likely to be part of a continuum rather than representing discrete states. The mo-\nlecular basis for the changes in set points likely lies at several levels such as of re-\nceptor/scaffold affinities, flux rate of molecules, as well as their absolute levels of \nexpression. In any case, the transition between equilibrium states relies on diffusion \nof molecules (including receptors and scaffold proteins) in and out synapses and the \ncharacteristic residence time of individual molecules or molecular assemblies in \nspecific subcellular compartments. Diffusion provides a rapid sorting mechanism as \nalready postulated for other cellular systems. Given the size of PSDs (diameter \naround 300 nm), the density of synapses (about 1 per µm2), and the diffusion coeffi-\ncients measured in the synaptic and extrasynaptic compartment, reasonable assump-\ntions allow one to estimate the time needed for a receptor to exit (100 msec) or en-\ncounter a synapse (in the order of the minute) (63). This scale difference results from \nthe large ratio of extrasynaptic to synaptic surface. Interestingly at excitatory syn-\napses, local delivery of receptors to the spine head (101) which itself constitute a \nconfined space, may allow an increase of the probability of diffusing receptors to be \ntrapped by the PSD. Changes in the shape of spines may regulate this trapping effi-\nciency (3). \n \nThat molecules only reside transiently in synapses implies that the molecular \ninteractions underlying their stabilization are reversible over a short time scale. Time \nresolved measurements indicate that receptor exchange between the outside and \ninside of the PSD results from multiple kinetic pathways. This suggests multiple \nassociation states between receptors and scaffolding molecules as described above \nfor the GlyR-gephyrin interaction (48). In a minimal model, these states can be de-\nfined as bound synaptic, bound extrasynaptic, superbound, etc. The latter state corre-\nsponds to receptors which stay for a long period (>30 s) and a higher confinement. \nAllocating the different states to identified structural features and determining the on \nand off rates between the states will allow access to the molecular biochemistry of \nreceptor binding to scaffolding proteins and scaffolding proteins binding to other \nscaffolding proteins in living cells. \n \nreverse rate constants with respect to affinity.

It explains how changes in concen-\ntrations, i.e. chemical potentials, of receptors and scaffolds, lead to new steady state \nof the postsynaptic molecular assembly: the cooperativity at the origin of the discon-\ntinuous change of density distributions allows the system to switch from one set \npoint of equilibrium to another one by small changes of key parameters. These \nchemical kinetics will need to be reconciled with specific biological mechanisms. \nThis can now be achieved because the behaviour of individual molecules can be \nmonitored, therefore allowing access to mechanisms normally hidden in the convo-\nluted statistics of the behaviour of large numbers of molecules. \n9.3 Reconciling Component Turnover and Synapse Structure Stability at \nSteady State \nStability of the synaptic structure in light of mobile receptors is a complex matter, \nbecause the local turnover (at synapses) of constitutive elements of the synapse is \nshorter than the lifetime of the structure (the synapse) (123). Recently, a new model \nhas been proposed (125) in which the stability of receptor density is compatible with \nreceptor individual turnover (Fig. 9). It accounts for the key idea that molecular \ninteractions and cooperativity can be at the origin of a metastability of clusters and \nthat their lifetime could be several orders of magnitude larger than that of their con-\nstitutive molecules. This quasi-equilibrium maintaining a stable density of receptor is \nalso shared by our model. \n \nThe question of how much time an individual receptor spends in the synaptic \nzone is an important issue (Fig. 9). At steady state, the fraction of time spent by a \nparticular receptor on a particular synaptic contact should be proportional to the \ndensity of the receptors at the contact. This is true if every receptor is well mixed so \nthat there are no separation between the permanently stagnant receptors and mobile \nreceptors. However, if some receptors are immobilized irreversibly (superbound) \nwithin the synaptic zone, the model can be modified to incorporate the contribution \nof these receptors. In order to test the hypothesis of mixing using single particle \ntracking, care must be taken so that the ensemble of trajectories tracked are not bi-\nased: if only those receptors which are initially diffusing in the extrasynaptic zone \nare sampled, then the statistics will be biased because of undetected receptors which \nstay within a synaptic site throughout the tracking experiment. Single-particle-\ntracking measurement has established at central excitatory synapses that about half \nof the receptors are mobile (39, 133). In contrast, FRAP (fluorescence recovery after \nphoto-breaching) experiments of glutamate receptors at Drosophila neuromuscular \njunctions suggests that they are immobilized once they enter into the postsynaptic \ndomain (109). However, one should stress that the stabilization of receptor density in \nthe synaptic zone with indefinite lifetime is compatible with a finite residence time \nof an individual receptor on a synaptic site. Recently, Fusi et al. proposed a cascade"}

Actually, dif-\nferent timescales can coexist to account for the dynamic turnover of constituting \nmolecules in the postsynaptic density. \n \nAnother concept, which arises from the present model, is that stabilization is a \nreciprocal and cooperative mechanism. In other words, scaffold proteins stabilize \nreceptors, and receptors stabilize scaffold proteins. This means that the local turnover \nof a given protein is not likely to determine by itself the turnover of the structure (see \nabove). Indeed, the characteristic time of the individual molecule is independent \nfrom that of the structure, but one should also consider the molecular interactions. In \nbiological terms, scaffolding molecules are not stabilizing the structure because they \nwould have a longer turnover in the structure. Actually, reciprocity can either attenu-\nate or amplify the amplitude of stochastic fluctuations of the receptor numbers at \neach synaptic site, depending on phase matching and consequently at the origin of a \nphase locking by reciprocity. This introduces robustness against the fluctuations of \ntotal receptor number associated with exo-/endocytosis at extrasynaptic sites. \n10 Conclusion \nDo receptor movements also exist in vivo in the freely behaving animal? This is a \ntechnical challenge. However in slices, FRAP experiments have revealed that cell \nsurface receptors such as AMPAR and NMDAR also display diffusive behaviors. \nThe basic biophysical properties of membranes have no reason to be fundamentally \ndifferent from those characterized in cultured cells. Until now, nobody has chal-\nlenged the fluid mosaic membrane model (127) in vivo. Nevertheless, extracellular \nand intercellular environments are likely different in vivo than in vitro and thus may \nimpose supplementary constraints on receptor diffusion. These measurements repre-\nsent the next frontier in this field. \nAcknowledgements \nWe wish to thank Cecile Bats, Cédric Bouzigues, Cécile Charrier, Laurent Cognet, \nMaxime Dahan, Marie-Virginie Erhensperger, Laurent Groc, Cyril Hanus, Martin \nHeine, David Holcman, Sabine Lévi, Brahim Lounis and Ken Sekimoto whose work \nis presented here and without whom this chapter would not be possible. \nReferences \n1. \nAdesnik H, Nicoll RA, and England PM.

For this reason, much effort has been made to \ndiscover how the delicate mechanisms of signal transduction at synapses lead to \nmodification of synaptic strength. One fruitful area of research over the last twenty \nyears has been the postsynaptic signaling apparatus in glutamatergic spines (8, 97, \n99, 106). Spines contain clusters of receptors and signaling proteins located in a \ndense submembranous structure that can be seen in the electron microscope and is \ncalled the postsynaptic density or PSD (For review of early work see 98). \nIn the 1970’s, Philip Siekevitz (40) and Carl Cotman (42) worked out subcellular \nfractionation methods to purify tiny disks from brain that contain many of the pro-\nteins that are most tightly bound to the PSD. Their purification methods were later \nused to obtain material from which several ubiquitous PSD proteins were identified \nand sequenced, including the prototypical scaffold protein, PSD-95 (37, 109, 113), \nsynGAP (35), the shank/proSAP family (20), and densin (6). At the same time, and \nindependently, some of these proteins, and additional new ones from the PSD frac-\ntion, were identified by their interactions in yeast two hybrid screens, including \nGKAP (104), synGAP (107), shank/proSAP (158), and homer (24). Continuing \nproteomic analyses of the PSD fraction or related “NMDA-receptor complexes” (89, \n127, 177, 235) have produced a catalog of putative PSD-associated proteins that \ncomprises a few hundred individual proteins. More recent studies have begun to \naddress the crucial question of the relative abundance of each protein in the PSD \nfraction and their stoichiometric ratios (126, 127, 177). \n \nHowever, we are still in the early stages of understanding which core protein \ncomplexes are present in most excitatory synapses, and which proteins are present \nonly in a subset of synapses, perhaps conferring specialized properties. \nJ.W.

It is a tetramer comprised of a pair of \nNR1 subunits and a pair of NR2 subunits. The NR2 subunits have unusually long cytosolic \ntails of 500 to 600 amino acids. These tails extend into the cytosol and interact with a variety \nof scaffold proteins and signaling enzymes. Of the four known NR2 subunits, NR2A and \nNR2B are the most abundant in forebrain neurons where the protein interactions of the tails \nhave been most thoroughly studied. Individual receptors in forebrain neurons can contain two \ncopies of NR2A, two of NR2B, or one copy of each (50, 86, 147, 148). \ncontain four transmembrane domains and are homologous to γ-subunits of Ca2+ channels.

{"text": "===== Page 5 =====\nScaffold Proteins in the Postsynaptic Density\n411\n \n3.1 The PSD-95 Family \nPSD-95 (also known as SAP90) was first identified as an abundant component of the \nPSD (37, 109). The first hint that it might be a scaffold protein came from the pres-\nence in its sequence of three repeated 90 residue domains and an SH3 domain. A \nfifth domain, now called a GK-domain (guanylate kinase-like) was at first thought to \nhave an enzymatic function; but it has been shown to be enzymatically silent and \ninstead to act as a protein-binding domain (104, 108). The three repeated domains \nare now called PDZ domains. Indeed, PDZ domains were first defined in PSD-95 \n(37, 113). A PDZ domain is a consensus protein-binding motif that is found in a \nwide variety of membrane-associated proteins. They bind specific sequences (e.g. a \n“tSXV motif”) that are usually located at the carboxyl terminus of a membrane pro-\ntein (114, 164) or they can associate through PDZ-PDZ interactions (164). In \nNMDARs, the C-terminal consensus sequence S-I/L-E-S-D/E-V in NR2 subunits \nbinds to the first and second PDZ domains of PSD-95 (113). This tSXV motif can \nalso bind to the corresponding PDZ domains of the other MAGUKs, SAP97, PSD-\n93, and SAP102. The PDZ domains of the PSD-95 family are relatively promiscuous \n“multifunctional” scaffold proteins. It is still not fully understood how the precise \nassociations of PSD-95 and the other MAGUKs are controlled inside cells in situa-\ntions when many binding partners are available. \nOverexpression of PSD-95 family proteins, NMDARs, or other target proteins in \nheterologous cells induces their clustering (103). Studies of NMDARs expressed \nwith PSD-95 in Xenopus oocytes suggest that PSD-95 can also modulate surface \nexpression and biophysical properties of NMDARs (131, 252). These findings were \ninterpreted to mean that PSD-95 might be important for insertion into the plasma \nmembrane and postsynaptic clustering of NMDARs. However, mutant mice in which \nthe first and second PDZ domains of PSD-95 are deleted have normal levels of sur-\nface synaptic NMDARs (154). They do, however display abnormal synaptic plastic-\nity, suggesting that the crucial role of PSD-95 is organization of signaling machinery \nnear the NMDAR. \nInterestingly, PSD-95 and its homologues play a role in targeting of AMPA re-\nceptors to synapses in hippocampal neurons (36, 122, 199) (see below). When both \nPSD-95 and PSD-93 are deleted, AMPA-receptor trafficking, but not NMDAR traf-\nficking, is altered in many synapses (12, 59). Taken together these data suggest that \n \n \nFig. 2.

The interaction between the NMDAR \nand PSD-95 appears to be important for proper alignment and interaction of signaling \nproteins within the spine but it is not crucial for NMDAR clustering at the synapse. \n3.1.1 Complexes Formed by PSD-95  \nThe PDZ domains of PSD-95 have been shown to bind to several proteins that are \nlocated in spines. However, it is still not known which of these associations actually \noccurs in vivo. Nor is it clear whether a particular set of associations predominates in \nthe spine, or whether the range of associations shifts depending on regulatory cues. \nThe first and second PDZ domains of PSD-95 can bind to the cytosolic carboxyl \ntermini of the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB4 (71, 88), semaphorin adhesion proteins \n(31, 201), the tails of shaker-type voltage-gated K+ channels (105), and several in-\nwardly rectifying potassium channels (161). The third PDZ domain binds the postsy-\nnaptic adhesion protein neuroligin (91, 212) and thus influences synaptic develop-\nment (185) and retrograde signaling (69). It also can bind to synGAP and kalirin7, \nboth of which influence signaling through small GTPases. Like EphB2, PSD-95 can \nbind to Src-family kinases and thus may localize and/or regulate them in the PSD \n(93, 94, 224). \nOne important role for PSD-95 is as a scaffold for Ca2+-activated signaling enzymes, \nplacing them in proximity to Ca2+ flowing through the NMDAR and, thus, forming a \nsignaling module whose activity is spatially and temporally restricted (64, 97). PSD-\n95 can bind to neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) through an atypical interaction \nwith the first and second PDZ domains (27, 38) and to synGAP, an abundant ras-\nGTPase activating protein in the PSD fraction, through the third PDZ domain (35, \n107). Both nNOS and synGAP are regulated by Ca2+ entry through the NMDAR (38, \n167). \n3.1.3 Small GTPases  \nPSD-95 has been reported to bind to several regulators of small GTPase proteins, \nincluding synGAP (35, 107), kalirin7 (179), SPAR (174), and citron (259), suggest-\ning that it may play a significant role in the orchestration of GTPase signaling in the \npostsynaptic spine. \nSynGAP is a ras and rap GTPase that is concentrated in the PSD presumably by \nvirtue of its interaction with the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 (35, 116). Its GAP \nactivity would be expected to increase the rate of inactivation of ras that has been \nactivated by rasGRF (see below), or by postsynaptic TrkB receptors stimulated by \nBDNF. This activity is enhanced by phosphorylation by CaMKII that is activated by \nstimulation of NMDARs (167). Deletion of the synGAP gene is lethal in mice a few \ndays after birth, indicating that it is a particularly crucial regulatory protein (110, \n111, 234). Mice heterozygous for the synGAP deletion have behavioral learning \n3.1.2 Ca2+-Regulated Enzymes"}
{"text": "===== Page 7 =====\nScaffold Proteins in the Postsynaptic Density\n413\n \n \n \ndeficits and defects in generation of LTP (111). Neurons cultured from mouse em-\nbryos homozygous for the synGAP deletion show derangements in cytoskeletal \nregulation (234) and in AMPA receptor trafficking (116, 192). The association of \nsynGAP with PSD-95 is important for regulation of the cytoskeleton, as evidenced \nby the fact that a mutant synGAP protein with a deletion of its tSXV domain cannot \nrescue the cytoskeletal defects (234). Taken together, these studies suggest that PSD-\n95 is important for proper coordination of signaling through small GTPases in the \nPSD. \nKalirin7, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Rho family of small \nGTPases, associates with the third PDZ domain of PSD-95. By virtue of this associa-\ntion, PSD-95 may help to coordinate regulation by EphB2 of spine morphology and \nNMDA receptor current. Kalirin7 has been shown to regulate formation and mainte-\nnance of dendrites and spines during development (138, 179, 180, 187). When it is \nactivated by binding of ephrin to the EphB2 receptor, kalirin7 activates Rac which \nthen activates PAK1, an enzyme that controls the actin cytoskeleton. During devel-\nopment, activation of PAK1 in dendrites leads to formation of mature dendritic \nspines (178). Activation of EphB2 also triggers an independent structural rearrange-\nment by promoting association between EphB2 itself and the NR1 subunit of the \nNMDAR (45), as well as, with postsynaptic PDZ domain-containing scaffold pro-\nteins such as GRIP/ABP (51, 215) and PICK1 (227). In this way, activated EphB2 is \nrecruited to the postsynaptic membrane. There it, in turn, recruits and activates \nmembers of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases which phosphorylate \nNR2 subunits of the NMDA receptor, resulting in an increase in conductance of Ca2+ \nupon glutamate stimulation (221, 237, 256). \nThe GK-domain of PSD-95 can bind directly to a spine-associated Rap-GAP \ntermed SPAR and recruit it into the NMDAR complex. SPAR also binds to actin and \ncontributes to regulation of the actin cytoskeleton of the spine by down-regulating \nthe activity of Rap (174). It also acts as a scaffold through its association with the \nmaster scaffold protein shank/proSAP (discussed below) via an intermediate protein \n(proSAPiP1) (241). \nFinally, the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 can associate with citron-N, a splice \nvariant of citron-kinase that lacks the kinase domain, and is situated in neuronal cell \nbodies, as well as concentrated at glutamatergic synapses in inhibitory neurons in the \nhippocampus and cortex and excitatory neurons in the thalamus and basal ganglia \n(68, 258, 259). Citron-N is a target of activated Rho and participates in organization \nof the Golgi apparatus in neurons (32). It binds to the Golgi apparatus, and controls \nactin filaments locally by assembling a complex of the Rho effector ROCK-II and \nthe neuron-specific actin-binding protein profilin-IIa. The precise role of citron-N at \nsynapses is still unknown. However, mutations in the gene encoding citron were \nrecently implicated in genetic predisposition toward affective disorders (137). \n3.1.4 AMPA Receptors  \nAs we will discuss in a later section, the PDZ domains of PSD-95 and its homologues, \nincluding SAP97 can associate with complexes surrounding AMPA receptors."}
{"text": "===== Page 8 =====\n414 \nM.B. Kennedy et al. \n \n3.1.5 The Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) Domain and Linkage to the Shank/proSAP \nScaffold  \nThe C-terminal GK-domain of PSD-95 and its homologues also acts as a specific \nprotein interaction site. One important family of PSD proteins called GK-associated \nproteins (GKAPs) (104, 198, 222) bind to the GK-domain and link the PSD-95 scaf-\nfold to members of the shank/proSAP family (21, 158). Shank proteins are large \nscaffold proteins that contain a series of protein interaction motifs and lack identified \ncatalytic domains. The single PDZ domain of shank binds to the C-terminus of \nGKAP. Shank proteins interact with a series of other scaffold proteins linking to-\ngether protein complexes associated with all three major classes of glutamate  \nreceptors. \nThe protein kinase scaffold AKAP-79/150 binds to the SH3 and GK-domains of \nPSD-95 or SAP97 (41). AKAP-79/150 contains binding sites for cAMP-dependent \nprotein kinase, C-kinase, and the Ca2+-regulated phosphatase, calcineurin. Its asso-\nciation with MAGUKs may help to properly position these enzymes near the postsy-\nnaptic membrane. \nHow and when each of these possible complexes is formed at different synapses, \nand how they are regulated, are subjects for future study. \n3.1.6 Dynamics of Association of PSD-95 with the PSD  \nBecause PSD-95 and the other MAGUK proteins are capable of a large number of \nhigh affinity associations with synaptic proteins, it is easy to imagine that individual \nPSD-95 proteins remain stably bound within a particular PSD once they arrive there. \nHowever, one study of tagged PSD-95 proteins in vivo reveals quite a different situa-\ntion. Although the size of individual PSDs is generally stable, individual PSD-95 \nproteins exist in a dynamic equilibrium moving rapidly among neighboring spines \nwith an average retention time in a single spine of 1–2 hr (78). The behavior suggests \nthat individual spines compete for limiting amounts of PSD-95 and that larger PSDs \ncontain more PSD-95 binding sites. This rapid dynamic equilibrium may permit \ncorrespondingly rapid remodeling of individual PSDs in response to biochemical \nchanges in PSD-95 binding proteins triggered by synaptic activity. \nStructural studies of PSD-95 itself suggest possible regulatory mechanisms that \ncould control the availability of its binding sites. The SH3 domain of PSD-95 inter-\nacts intimately with the GK domain such that a portion of the GK domain is neces-\nsary to complete the SH3 fold (149, 150, 223). Point mutations that disrupt the inter-\naction between the two domains interfere with the ability of PSD-95 to cluster \npotassium channels in heterologous cells, suggesting the conformation and/or avail-\nability of PDZ domains has been altered (209). Furthermore, patch analysis of the \ntertiary structure of PSD-95 suggests that it can exist in two distinct stable conforma-\ntions; one that obscures the binding cleft of the third PDZ domain and another that \nexposes it (112). Future studies of regulation of the conformation of PSD-95 may \nreveal new mechanisms that contribute to control and remodeling of signaling com-\nplexes in the spine."}
{"text": "===== Page 9 =====\nScaffold Proteins in the Postsynaptic Density\n415\n \n \n \n3.2 Direct Association of Signaling Proteins with the Tails of NMDA \nReceptor Subunits \nThe structure of the NMDA receptor is unusual in several ways. One of its most \nstriking structural features is the extended carboxyl termini of the NR2 subunits. \nThese tails comprise approximately 600 residues and extend into the cytosol where \nthey interact with PSD-95 (113); but also bind directly to the signaling enzymes \nCaMKII (11) and rasGRFI (115). The tails can also associate with the actin-\nassociated protein, α-actinin (248), and the scaffold protein yotiao which binds pro-\ntein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein kinase A (PKA) (242). Thus, these tails appear \nto serve a scaffolding function of their own that helps to arrange the NMDA receptor \nsignaling complex. \n3.2.1 CaMKII  \nThe most thoroughly studied enzyme that binds to the tail of NR2 subunits is \nCa2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) (14, 190). It is one of several \ncritical determinants of synaptic plasticity that are activated by influx of Ca2+ \nCaMKII has an elaborate structure. Individual catalytic subunits are activated by \nthe Ca2+-bound form of calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM), which binds to a single CaM-\nbinding domain within each subunit, and in so doing opens up the catalytic site so \nthat it is able to interact with substrate proteins (14, 15, 176). The catalytic subunits \nassemble into a large holoenzyme made up of 12 catalytic units held together by \ninteractions among association domains in the carboxyl third of their sequence (14, \n189, 190). The holoenzymes are randomly assembled from two closely related cata-\nlytic subunits termed α and β (14, 29, 100). In the forebrain, α-subunits predominate \nover β-subunits by a ratio of 3 to 1. When all of the subunits are in an inactive state, \nthe holoenzyme takes the form of six dimers because individual pairs of catalytic \nsubunits bind to each other by a coiled coil interaction between their calmodulin \nbinding domains (190). Activation of subunits by binding of Ca2+/CaM is accompa-\nnied by autophosphorylation of a key residue in each subunit, threonine-286. Phos-\nphorylation of this site prevents the catalytic site from closing when CaM later disso-\nciates; thus, it holds the subunit in an active conformation (155). In order for this \nautophosphorylation to occur, Ca2+/CaM must be bound to two neighboring subunits, \none that acts as the “kinase” and a second that acts as the “substrate” (79). Based on \ntheir crystal structure, Rosenberg et al. (190) proposed that binding of Ca2+/CaM \ndissociates the members of an inactive dimer pair, exposing their active sites and \npermitting autophosphorylation to occur between them. \nCaMKII is an abundant constituent of the PSD fraction (101) which implies that \nthe PSD contains many sites at which it can bind. In turn, each holoenzyme likely \ncontains at least 12 possible sites that could bind to docking proteins in the PSD. \nCaMKII is an abundant protein in the forebrain, constituting ~ 1–2% of the total \nprotein content (60). Therefore, it is likely to be present in excess of its individual \nbinding sites in the PSD. At least three proteins in the PSD have been identified as \nthrough the NMDAR (65, 99, 132, 193, 261). Its positioning near the NMDAR \nwould place it in an ideal location to influence synaptic plasticity."}

Kennedy et al. \n \npotential docking sites for CaMKII; the tails of the NR2 subunits of the NMDA \nreceptor, the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor, and densin, a sialylated trans-\nmembrane protein that has a short cytosolic domain and is highly enriched in the \nPSD (6). Three other proteins located near the PSD also bind CaMKII. α-actinin \nbinds to CaMKII directly and forms a stable ternary complex with CaMKII and \ndensin (236), and also with CaMKII and NR2B (121). F-actin, which makes up the \nspine cytoskeleton, binds the less abundant β-subunit of CaMKII, but does not bind \nthe more abundant α-subunit (168, 205). Finally, the PDZ-domain-containing scaf-\nfold protein MUPP-1 has been reported to bind directly to CaMKII (116). The best \nstudied of all of these potential interactions is the one with the tails of the NR2A and \nNR2B subunits. \nThe two most prominent NR2 subunits in the forebrain, NR2A and NR2B, both \nbind CaMKII at sites located in their long cytosolic carboxyl termini (73, 123, 216). \nBinding to either one requires activation of CaMKII by Ca2+/CaM; however, the \nbinding sites in NR2A and NR2B are not identical. The tail of NR2B binds CaMKII \nwith high affinity at two distinct sites (11, 217); a site distal to the membrane (resi-\ndues 1259–1310) that requires binding of Ca2+/CaM to CaMKII, and a more proxi-\nmal site (residues 829–1120) that only binds CaMKII after autophosphorylation at \nThr286 (11, 200). Binding to the distal site stabilizes the activated form of CaMKII \n(11). However, phosphorylation by CaMKII of Ser1303 on NR2B reduces the affin-\nity of the distal site and leads to slow dissociation of the kinase from NR2B (217). \nThe tail of NR2A binds CaMKII with a lower affinity than NR2B. Binding to a site \nin NR2A between residues 1244 and 1464 is enhanced by activation by Ca2+/CaM \nand by autophosphorylation (74). Phosphorylation by protein kinase C of Ser1416 in \nNR2A inhibits binding of CaMKII and promotes dissociation of the CaMKII/NR2A \ncomplex, providing a mechanism by which activation of mGluRs could decrease \nbinding of CaMKII to the NMDA receptor (72). These interactions are likely impor-\ntant for appropriate positioning of CaMKII in the spine, although their precise func-\ntional roles, in particular, the significance of the difference in binding bwtween \nNR2A and NR2B, have not yet been dissected. \nThe NR1 subunit, which contains a 30 residue membrane proximal region termed \nC0 in its short cytosolic tail (121), can bind to CaMKII. Like the binding to the \nmembrane proximal domain of the tail of NR2B, binding to NR1 requires autophos-\nphorylation of CaMKII at Thr286. Both α-actinin and Ca2+/CaM also bind to the C0 \ndomain, and binding of CaMKII is competitive with their binding (121). Binding of \nα-actinin has been shown to increase the open probability of the NMDAR. For this \nreason, it has been suggested that the competitive binding of autophosphorylated \nCaMKII may contribute to Ca2+-dependent inactivation of NMDARs (117, 257). \nTranslocation of CaMKII into spines following stimulation of glutamate recep-\ntors has been observed with the use of GFP-labeled CaMKII transfected into cultured \nneurons. In young, cultured hippocampal neurons, pharmacological stimulation of \nNMDARs caused a rapid, transient redistribution of CaMKII from the actin cy-\ntoskeleton to synaptic sites (203, 204). In another paradigm, chemical induction of \nLTP in hippocampal slices by application of forskolin in medium containing no Mg2+ \ncaused translocation of CaMKII into spines (172). Hypoxia can also cause accumula-\ntion of CaMKII in the PSD (53, 218), so there was some doubt about whether"}
{"text": "===== Page 11 =====\nScaffold Proteins in the Postsynaptic Density\n417\n \n \n \nphysiological stimulation in vivo produces translocation of CaMKII to the PSD. \nHowever, translocation under normal physiological circumstances in vivo was re-\nported in living zebrafish (76) where repeated sensory stimulation produced repro-\nducible and reversible translocation of GFP-CaMKII to the PSD in an identified \ninterneuron in the sensorimotor circuit. \nThe complex regulation of localization of CaMKII in the spine observed in cells \nand in the PSD, studied biochemically, illustrates how scaffold proteins may help to \ndynamically configure the location of regulatory proteins in the spine. For example, \nbinding of Ca2+/CaM to CaMKII causes its release from F-actin (168) and from the \nscaffold protein MUPP1 (116). On the other hand, binding of Ca2+/CaM and auto-\nphosphorylation dramatically increase binding of CaMKII to the NMDAR. Thus, \nCa2+ influx into the spine would be predicted to promote release of CaMKII from the \nspine actin cytoskeleton and subsequent binding to the NMDAR (2, 152). As another \nexample, binding of CaMKII to the NMDAR or to densin is facilitated by concomi-\ntant binding of these proteins to α-actinin (121, 236). However, densin has a much \ngreater affinity for the α-subunit of CaMKII than for the β-subunit (236); whereas, \nthe NMDAR does not show this selectivity. The α-subunit, and not the β-subunit, \ncan be synthesized from mRNA in dendrites in response to synaptic stimuli that \ninduce potentiation (30, 173). Thus, densin in the PSD may preferentially concen-\ntrate holoenzymes of CaMKII that are newly synthesized in dendrites. \n3.2.2 RasGRF1  \nActivation of ras is critical for regulation of insertion and removal of AMPA recep-\ntors in the spine (260) and for activation of the protein kinase cascade leading to \nactivation of MAP kinases Erk 1 and 2 (219). Ras can be activated at synapses via \nseveral different receptors, including the Trk receptor protein tyrosine kinases. How-\never, rasGRF1, a ras-specific GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF) that is regulated by \nCa2+/CaM, provides a means by which activation of the NMDAR can directly acti-\nvate ras and its downstream pathways (62, 80, 115). RasGRF1 has been shown to \nbind to the cytosolic tail of the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor (115). This \nbinding would locate rasGRF1 near the mouth of the NMDAR and thus enable it to \nefficiently sense a local rise in Ca2+ concentration around the activated receptor. \nLearning and memory are impaired in rasGRF1 knockout mice (25, 75), confirming \nthe importance of this protein in synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, disruption of the \ninteraction between rasGRF1 and the NMDA receptor by introduction of a specific \npeptide blocker into neurons disupts activation of the ERK1/2 pathway following \napplication of NMDA (115). \nThe finding that rasGRF1 associates specifically with the NR2B subunit of the \nNMDAR, and not with NR2A, suggests that the presence of rasGRF1 might be an \nimportant difference between signaling complexes formed near receptors containing \nNR2A subunits and those containing only NR2B. There may be competition between \nrasGRF1 and CaMKII for binding to NR2B. The binding sites for the two proteins \non NR2B overlap extensively; however, it hasn’t yet been demonstrated that they \ncompete for binding. SynGAP, a ras inactivating GTPase that binds to PSD-95 is \nstimulated by phosphorylation by CaMKII that is activated by Ca2+ flux through the"}
{"text": "===== Page 12 =====\n418 \nM.B. Kennedy et al. \n \nNMDA receptor. The relative timing of activation of rasGRF and synGAP would \ndetermine the time course of ras activation near NMDARs. It will be interesting to \nlearn how interactions among the scaffold proteins associated with the NMDAR in \nthe PSD regulate this timing. Since ras can drive insertion of AMPA receptors into \nthe synaptic plasma membrane, and also leads to changes in the actin cytoskeleton \nthrough activation of rac, the answer will have implications for the orchestration of \nactivity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the spine. \n4 Scaffold Proteins Associated with AMPA-Type Glutamate \nReceptors \nAMPARs mediate rapid excitatory glutamatergic transmission in the brain. They are \ncomposed of four homologous subunits (GluR1-4, also called GluRA-D) which \nassemble in combinations to form the distinct AMPAR subtypes (50, 86, 147, 148). \nTheir trafficking to, insertion into, and removal from the postsynaptic membrane is \ntightly regulated at all stages of development. In mature neurons, this regulation \nunderlies activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength such as LTP and LTD (7, \nFive scaffold proteins interact directly with GluR subunits and participate in \nregulation of AMPAR trafficking: Stargazin (a TARP protein), GRIP (GluR-\ninteracting protein)/ABP (AMPAR-binding protein), PICK1 (protein interacting with \nC kinase 1), and NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor). PSD-95 participates indi-\nrectly in trafficking of AMPARs through its interaction with Stargazin. In addition, \nPSD-95 binds directly to the GluR6 and KA2 subunits of kainate receptors (70, 151). \n4.1 GRIP/ABP, PICK1, and NSF \nCertain scaffold proteins bind selectively to the GluR2/3 AMPARs and are believed \nto regulate their insertion into, and removal from, synaptic sites (133). Two of these, \nthe homologous proteins GRIP (GRIP1) (51) and ABP (GRIP2) (52, 213, 249) con-\ntain a total of six to seven PDZ domains and no catalytic domains. The cytosolic tail \nof GluR2 can bind to the fourth or fifth PDZ domain of either protein. Both GRIP \nand ABP are palmitoylated. The palmitoylated form is targeted to the postsynaptic \nmembrane; whereas, the nonpalmitoylated form is targeted to intracellular mem-\nbranes (48, 253). Thus, regulated palmitoylation of GRIP and ABP is believed to \nanchor AMPARs to one or the other of these membrane compartments to modulate \nAMPAR trafficking (23, 47, 48, 66, 85, 102, 169, 202). However, disruption of the \n9, 16, 26, 43, 82, 92, 128, 140, 141, 145, 175, 207, 208, 210). In pyramidal neurons \nof the hippocampus, where their regulation is most often studied, AMPARs are pri-\nmarily hetero-oligomers of GluR1 and 2 subunits (GluR1/2) or of GluR 2 and 3 \nsubunits (GluR2/3). The insertion of GluR1/2 AMPARs into the postsynaptic mem-\nbrane is regulated by synaptic activity (207); whereas, GluR2/3 AMPARs cycle \nconstitutively in and out of the postsynaptic membrane. The detailed mechanisms of \nAMPAR trafficking are discussed in the Chapter by Esteban. Here we focus on in-\nteractions of GluR subunits with scaffold proteins that contribute to their localization \nat the postsynaptic membrane."}
{"text": "===== Page 13 =====\nScaffold Proteins in the Postsynaptic Density\n419\n \n \n \ninteraction between the AMPAR and GRIP/ABP interferes more severely with synap-\ntic localization of the receptors than with internal trafficking (51). Thus, we still have \nan incomplete understanding of the role of GRIP and ABP in receptor localization. \nA third scaffold protein that binds to GluR2 is PICK1, which contains a PDZ \ndomain that binds selectively to protein kinase C-α (PKCα) (214) and a BAR do-\nmain that binds preferentially to curved membranes (182). PICK1 and GRIP/ABP \nappear to work together to regulate trafficking and surface expression of GluR2/3 \nreceptors. In addition to PKCα, the single PDZ domain of PICK1 also associates \nwith the cytosolic tail of the short forms of GluR2 and GluR3 subunits (49). Through \nformation of homomultimers, PICK1 is believed to position PKCα near the tail of \nGluR2 (39, 181) where it can phosphorylate GluR2 on serine-880 (144, 181). This \nphosphorylation releases GluR2 from GRIP/APB, but leaves it bound to PICK1. \nDissociation of GluR2 from GRIP/ABP appears to be required for both insertion \nand removal of AMPARs at synaptic sites (23, 47, 66, 85, 102, 169, 202). The pro-\nposed mechanism begins with PICK1 promoting dissociation of GluR2 from \nGRIP/ABP when it binds to the GRIP/ABP/GluR2 complex and induces phosphory-\nlation of GluR2 on serine-880 by PKC. As GRIP/ABP unbinds from the phosphory-\nlated form of GluR2, PDZ domains on PICK1 multimers bind to the freed PDZ-\nbinding motif on GluR2. The BAR domain on PICK1 then promotes association of \nGluR2 with budding endo- and exocytotic vesicles that mediate trafficking of AM-\nPARs to and from the postsynaptic membrane. This mechanism is consistent with the \nfindings that PICK1 promotes both internalization and recycling of GluR2 (133), and \nthat disruption of interaction of GluR2/3 with PICK1 or GRIP/ABP impairs expres-\nsion of LTD (102, 202). \nAlthough they are not strictly scaffold proteins, NSF (N-ethylmaleimide sensitive \nfusion protein) and the clathrin adaptor AP2 interact with the cytosolic tail of the \nGluR2 subunit at a membrane proximal region different from the C-terminal PDZ-\nbinding domain that interacts with GRIP/ABP and PICK1. They are required for \nregulation of AMPAR trafficking and surface expression and thus they also have \nbeen shown to be important for normal expression of synaptic plasticity, in particular \nLTD (120, 136, 163, 170, 211). \nScaffold proteins generally interact with several proteins, sometimes at the same \nsites. In this regard, PSD scaffold proteins are no exception. In addition to the \nAMPAR, GRIP/ABP binds to the cytosolic tail of the receptor tyrosine kinase \nEphB2 (87), the scaffold protein Liprin-α (247), and the neuronal ras-GEF GRASP-1 \n(255). Interactions with these proteins likely help to regulate other, less well under-\nstood, aspects of postsynaptic function. \n4.2 SAP97 and SAP102 \nThe PSD-95 homologues, SAP97 and SAP102, have functions distinct from, but \nrelated to, those of PSD-95. SAP97 binds specifically to the tail of the GluR1 subunit \nof AMPARs (122, 197). It can form a trimeric complex with GluR1 and the motor \nprotein myosin VI (244). The interaction of GluR1 and SAP97 occurs early in the \nbiosynthetic pathway of the receptor, either in the endoplasmic reticulum or cis-\nGolgi apparatus; on the other hand, few synaptic receptors are associated with"}
{"text": "===== Page 14 =====\n420 \nM.B. Kennedy et al. \n \nSAP97 (197). These results suggest that SAP97 may mediate trafficking of GluR1 to \nthe synapse via a myosin VI motor pathway. SAP102 associates with the tails of \nNMDA receptor subunits, but is most prominently expressed early in development \n(184). In mice, the levels of SAP102 decrease during the second week after birth, \nwhile levels of PSD-95 increase. Thus, SAP102 may play an important role in trans-\nport or targeting of NMDARs in the early stages of synaptic development. \n4.3 Stargazin and PSD-95 \nStargazin is a member of a family of proteins, collectively referred to as TARPs. The \nfamily comprises Stargazin (also called  γ-2) and three homologous proteins (γ-3, γ-\n4, and γ-8), all of which are transmembrane auxiliary subunits of AMPARs (162, \n171, 225). Stargazin/γ-2 is structurally related to the γ-1 subunit of the voltage-\ndependent calcium channel (VDCC) and was initially believed to be a calcium chan-\nnel subunit (124). It was soon recognized that the TARPs are not part of the VDCC; \nrather they bind to subunits of the AMPA receptor (36, 226) and influence their \ntrafficking, targeting, and biophysical properties (67, 159, 233). \nTARPs contain a C-terminal consensus binding motif that binds selectively to the \nfirst two PDZ domains of PSD-95 (67). This interaction is required for activity-\ndependent translocation of AMPA receptors to postsynaptic sites (199). Disruption \nof the synaptic localization of PSD-95 dramatically reduces the number of synaptic \nAMPARs (58). In contrast, when PSD-95 is over-expressed the number of synaptic \nAMPARs increases (199), producing an enhancement of AMPA receptor-mediated \nsynaptic transmission that occludes LTP and increases the amplitude of LTD (215). \nThese findings suggest that interaction of AMPAR/TARP complexes with PSD-95 \nrecruits extrasynaptic AMPAR/TARP complexes to postsynaptic sites in order to \nincrease synaptic strength (57). The mechanisms of AMPA receptor trafficking and \nits role in synaptic plasticity are discussed in more detail in Chapters by Esteban, \nChoquet and Triller, and Lisman and Hell. \n5 Protein Complexes Associated with the Metabotropic Glutamate \nReceptor Through the Scaffold Protein Homer \nGlutamate activates two groups of G-protein coupled metabotropic receptors that \nmodulate neuronal excitability and synaptic strength. Group I mGluRs, mGluR1 and \nmGluR5, regulate phospholipase C which produces the second messengers IP3 and \ndiacylglycerol. Group I mGluRs are concentrated at the periphery of the PSD (10, \n135, 165) and can influence synaptic plasticity (22). Their linkage to the PSD is \nmediated by the homer family of scaffold proteins (24, 250). The family comprises \nhomer1, 2, and 3, each of which is alternatively spliced into long and short isoforms \n(termed “a” isoforms) (95, 250). All of the homers contain an N-terminal EVH1 \nproteins (13). The long homer isoforms contain a C-terminal coiled-coil (CC) do-\nmain which promotes their self-association into tetramers (81, 220). In contrast, the \nshort isoforms do not contain the CC domain and thus are monomeric (95). The short \ndomain which binds to a proline-rich motif (PPXXF) in mGluRs and in several other"}
{"text": "===== Page 15 =====\nScaffold Proteins in the Postsynaptic Density\n421\n \n \n \nhomers, for example homer1a, were originally discovered as “immediate early \ngenes” whose expression is rapidly induced by synaptic activity (24). In contrast, \nlong homers, for example homer1b/c, are constitutively expressed (61, 251). \n5.1 Linkage to the IP3R and Shank/proSAP \nIn addition to group 1 mGluRs, the EVH1 domain of homer binds to the type 1 inosi-\ntol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) (229) and shank, a PSD scaffold protein (228). \nBecause the long homer isoforms can form tetramers, they act as hubs that cross-link \nthe different EVH1 domain-interacting proteins (228, 229). In contrast, the short \nmonomeric homers antagonize this function and thus act as endogeneous “dominant \nnegatives”, breaking up linkages between mGluRs and other EVH1-interacting  \nproteins when they are rapidly and transiently expressed upon synaptic stimulation \n(24, 96). \nAn interesting example of this dynamic is the coupling between group 1 mGluRs \nand IP3Rs (229). The IP3R is an IP3-sensitive Ca2+ channel localized in the smooth \nendoplasmic reticulum (SER). Activation of group 1 mGluRs results in production of \nthe second messenger IP3. IP3 binds to the nearby IP3R causing it to open and re-\nlease Ca2+ from the SER, which functions as an intracellular calcium store. The \nmGluR/homer/IP3R complex thus couples synaptic activation of group 1 mGluRs to \nrelease of Ca2+ from SER located in dendritic spines (196). In the electron micro-\nscope, the SER of dendritic spines can be seen juxtaposed to the postsynaptic mem-\nbrane at the periphery of the PSD where group I mGluRs and homer are located \n(250). Activity-induced expression of short isoforms of homer apparently interferes \nwith the coupling between mGluRs and the IP3R, because over-expression of a short \nhomer impairs release of intracellular calcium evoked by quisqualate, an mGluR \nagonist (229). Binding of the short form homer1a to receptor isoforms mGluR1a and \nmGluR5a and b also induces constitutive receptor activation (5). When the long \nhomer3 is in excess, it masks the constitutive activity conferred by homer1a (5). \nThus, expression of homer1a would be expected to reduce release of Ca2+ from intra-\ncellular stores following activation of mGluRs; but, for some receptor subtypes, \nincrease production of IP3 and diacylglycerol. \n6 The Shank/proSAP Scaffold of Scaffolds \nThe distribution of scaffold proteins in the PSD, measured by immunoelectron mi-\ncroscopy, suggests a laminar organization (183, 232). The peak concentration of \nPSD-95 occurs at an average distance of 12 nm from the synaptic plasma membrane; \nwhereas, the peak of GKAP-shank was detected at an average distance of 24–26 nm \nfrom the membrane. Cript and dynein, which may help to link PSD proteins to cy-\ntoskeletal elements, lie even further away, 29–31 nm from the membrane. The \nshank/ProSAP family of scaffold proteins (20, 21, 129, 158, 228, 254) acts as a scaf-\nfold of scaffolds, linking together PSD-95-associated proteins, homer-associated \nproteins, and the actin cytoskeleton (8, 19, 206)."}
{"text": "===== Page 16 =====\n422 \nM.B. Kennedy et al. \n \n6.1 Shank/proSAP Multimerization \nShank forms homomultimers through interactions of its SAM domains with each \nother and with sharpin (130, 158). Its single PDZ domain can also dimerize in an \nanti-parallel configuration, contributing to multimerization (90). The SAM domains \nform sheets of helical rods in vitro suggesting that shank multimers may form a \nplatform that stabilizes the organization of the PSD (8). By virtue of shank’s rich \ncollection of protein-interaction domains (6-7 ankyrin repeats, an SH3 domain, a \nPDZ domain, a proline-rich region) this two-dimensional protein lattice could likely \naccommodate several ligands including homer and GKAP/SAPAP, which links to \nPSD-95 (8). The shank platform could thus cross-link the NMDA and metabotropic \nglutamate receptor complexes. It may also link to AMPAR complexes either via \ndirect binding to the GluR1 subunit (230) or through interactions between the TARP \nproteins and PSD-95 (162). \n6.2 Interaction with Homer \nThe physical interaction between group 1 mGluRs and the shank scaffold is medi-\nated by the long isoforms of homer (56). This structural coupling may underlie func-\ntional coupling between group 1 mGluRs and the NMDAR (166), in which mGluR1 \ncan upregulate current through the NMDAR by stimulating phosphorylation of the \nreceptor by the proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) and Src-family kinases that are \npart of the NMDAR complex (83). The long isoforms of homer and shank also ap-\npear to cooperate in morphogenesis of dendritic spines. Accumulation of shank in \nsynapses depends on its ability to bind to Homer (194) and also to GKAP/SAPAP \n(158). When over-expressed alone or in combination, the long isoforms of homer \nand shank synergistically increase the number and size of spines (195). As expected, \noverexpression of the short isoforms of homer have the opposite effect on spine \nmorphogenesis, reducing synaptic targeting of shank and other PSD proteins, and \ninhibiting synaptic transmission (194). \n6.3 Interaction with the Actin Cytoskeleton \nThrough its interactions with cortactin, Abp1 and spectrin/fodrin, the shank scaffold \nmediates binding of the PSD to the underlying spine actin cytoskeleton (18, 158, \n186) and thus facilitates a functional connection between activation of postsynaptic \nreceptors and changes in the spine cytoskeleton, as discussed below. \n7 Attachment of the Cytoskeleton to the PSD by Actin-Associated \nProteins \nDendritic spines contain a higher density of actin filaments than any other neuronal \nstructure, and the arrangement of these filaments gives spines their characteristic \nshapes (63, 143). The narrow neck contains longitudinally bundled filaments, \nwhereas the head contains a lattice-like mesh that supports its bulbous shape (118)."}
{"text": "===== Page 17 =====\nScaffold Proteins in the Postsynaptic Density\n423\n \n \n \nIn mature synapses, the actin cytoskeleton immobilizes some, but not all, compo-\nnents of the PSD. For example, treatment of cultured neurons with latrunculin A, a \ntoxin that causes depolymerization of actin by sequestering G-actin, results in a de-\ncrease in spines of AMPA and NMDA receptors, α-actinin-2, drebrin (an actin bind-\ning protein that can cluster actin), and CaMKII. Thus, the attachment of F-actin to \nthe PSD contributes to immobilization of receptors and other proteins at the synapse \nand helps to regulate their function. In contrast, PSD-95 remains in spines even after \nthe depolymerization of actin (3, 4), suggesting that PSD-95 may form a stable core \nscaffold that does not require the cytoskeleton for its aggregation. \nThree actin binding proteins physically connect the cytoskeleton to the PSD: α-\nactinin, cortactin, and spectrin. \n7.1 α-Actinin \nα-Actinin is an actin binding protein that can cross-link actin filaments (153). The α-\nactinin family comprises 4 members (α-actinin1-4), of which isoforms 1, 2, and 4 are \nexpressed in the brain (235, 236, 246). Proteins of the α-actinin family contain an \nactin-binding domain at the N-terminus, four spectrin repeats in their central region \n(153), and a Ca2+-binding EF hand motif (243) and PDZ domain-binding sequence at \nthe C-terminus (236). α-Actinin self-associates into antiparallel dimers that can bind \nactin at both ends, which gives it the ability to crosslink F-actin. Overexpression of \nα-actinin-2 has been shown to increase the length and density of dendritic protru-\nsions in cultured hippocampal neurons (160). \nα-actinin also plays an important role in the localization and function of NMDA \nreceptors. α-actinin-2 colocalizes with NMDA receptors in spines and binds directly \nto both the NR1 and NR2 subunits (55, 248). This interaction is antagonized by both \ncalcium-bound CaM and autophosphorylated CaMKII (121, 248). Interestingly, \ndissociation of the NMDA receptor from F-actin causes rapid inactivation of the \nchannel (248, 257), while association with the cytoskeleton enhances NMDA recep-\ntor activity (191). Thus, NMDA receptors are probably tethered to F-actin under \nresting conditions but dissociate and become inactivated in response to calcium in-\nflux through the channel. \nAnother possible point of attachment in the PSD for F-actin via α-actinin is \ndensin. The conserved C-terminal region of α-actinin-4 has been shown to bind to \nthe PDZ domain of densin. α-actinin-4 can also bind directly to CaMKII; whereas, \ndensin binds both α-actinin-4 and CaMKII. Thus, the three proteins form a highly \nstable ternary complex. Autophosphorylation of CaMKII increases its affinity for \ndensin, indicating that formation of the complex probably depends on the level of \nintracellular calcium (236). \n7.2 Cortactin \nCortactin drives de novo nucleation of actin filaments and creates branch points on \npreexisting filaments by activating the ARP2/3 complex. In addition to promoting \nextension of actin filaments, cortactin stabilizes existing F-actin. Cortactin contains"}
{"text": "===== Page 18 =====\n424 \nM.B. Kennedy et al. \n \nan acidic domain at its N-terminus, as do other actin nucleation promoting proteins, \nincluding WASP, N-WASP, and SCAR/WAVE; all of which interact with the \nARP2/3 complex (231, 238, 240, 245). The central region of cortactin comprises 6.5 \ntandem copies of a 37 amino acid repeat that are the sites of interaction with F-actin \n(245). Its C-terminus contains a helical domain, a proline-rich domain, and an SH3 \ndomain (46). The SH3 domain of cortactin interacts with a PSD protein originally \nnamed CortBP1 (54), which is a splice variant of shank2/proSAP-1. This interaction \nhas been shown to physically link the PSD scaffold to the cytoskeleton (54, 158). \nCortactin is highly enriched in spines where it colocalizes with F-actin (84, 188). \nElectron microscopic studies of immunogold labeled cortactin show that approxi-\nmately 10% of cortactin in the spine is located in the PSD, while the bulk of the \nstaining occurs within the core of the spine, with the peak average concentration \n100–150 nm away from the PSD (188). This finding indicates that there are at least \ntwo pools of cortactin in the spine, a small one interacting with the PSD, and a larger \none interacting with the actin cytoskeleton of the spine. Interestingly, NMDA recep-\ntor activation induces translocation of cortactin from spines into the dendrite (84), \nsuggesting that movement of cortactin might be important for activity-dependent \nremodeling of the spine cytoskeleton. \nAs predicted, the level of cortactin is a strong determinant of spine morphology in \ncultured hippocampal neurons. Knockdown of endogenous cortactin in mature cul-\ntured hippocampal neurons by siRNA drastically reduces the total number of den-\ndritic protrusions (84). This result means that cortactin is required for the mainte-\nnance of mature spines perhaps because it stabilizes filaments or promotes overall \ngrowth of the actin network. Overexpression of cortactin in cultured neurons pro-\nduces abnormally long spines, similar to those observed when α-actinin is overex-\npressed. This elongation requires both the N-terminal region of cortactin that inter-\nacts with F-actin and the Arp2/3 complex (84). \n7.3 Spectrin/fodrin \nSpectrin is the main component of the cytoskeleton that underlies cell membranes \nand gives them their shape. It was first identified in erythrocytes where it forms a \nfilamentous network required for red blood cells to maintain their shape and elastic-\nity (142). The spectrin family of proteins includes α- and β-spectrin and α- and β-\nfodrin. Fodrin is the predominant form of spectrin in the brain and is also referred to \nas spectrin II or brain spectrin. The α and β subunits of fodrin differ in their domain \ncomposition: the α subunit contains 21 triple helical repeats with a segment contain-\ning an SH3 domain in the 10th repeat, while the β subunit contains only 17 triple \nhelical repeats and does not contain an SH3 domain. The β subunit also contains an \nactin-binding region at its N-terminus and some splice variants of β subunits contain \na PH domain. Within the membrane cytoskeleton, the α and β subunits typically \nform heterotetramers by first forming antiparallel heterodimers which then associate \nhead to head to form a tetramer. Fodrin connects the actin cytoskeleton to the cell \nmembranes by interacting with transmembrane proteins such as ankyrin (44, 77). \nIn spines, fodrin is also present in the PSD where it binds directly to NR1, NR2A \nand NR2B subunits of NMDA receptors in an activity-dependent manner (33, 125,"}
{"text": "===== Page 19 =====\nScaffold Proteins in the Postsynaptic Density\n425\n \n \n \n239). The interaction between fodrin and the NMDAR is regulated by calcium and \nby various protein kinases. Such regulation provides a potential mechanism by which \nthe motility of the NMDA receptor in the membrane may be regulated by synaptic \nactivity. CaM inhibits binding between fodrin and NR1 and Ca2+ antagonizes binding \nbetween fodrin and NR2B (239). Binding of fodrin is also inhibited by phosphoryla-\ntion of the NR1 C-terminal domain by PKA and PKC and the NR2A C-terminal \ndomain by the tyrosine kinase fyn (239). In the neuromuscular junction, removal of \nactin and spectrin from myotube membranes results in dispersal of AChRs (17). By \nanalogy, fodrin may be important for immobilizing receptors at the synapse (1). \n8 Conclusion \nThe postsynaptic density provides a quintessential example of the organization of \nsignaling proteins to provide specificity of regulatory control. Three classes of pro-\nteins; the PSD-95 family of MAGUK proteins, the homer family, and the \nshank/proSAP family, have evolved to provide a highly organized structural frame-\nwork to which signaling molecules can bind to carry out their functions. Future stud-\nies will allow us to understand how this scaffold structure provides for accurate regu-\nlation of synaptic plasticity, and how the structure is maintained and sculpted in a \ndynamic equilibrium. \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank the members of the Kennedy laboratory for many useful discussions.

Sabatini1 and Karel Svoboda2 \n1 Department of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School, 220 Longwood Avenue,  \n \n \nAbstract. Dendritic spines are neuronal microcompartments that are diffusionally isolated \nfrom their parent dendrites and neighboring spines. Optical studies of spine Ca2+ dynamics \nhave revealed the Ca2+ sources and Ca2+ clearance mechanisms under a variety of \nexperimental conditions and in diverse experimental systems. Here we review our \nunderstanding of Ca2+ signaling in spines, point out gaps in our knowledge, and discuss the \nlimits of the existing experimental techniques. \n1 Introduction \nPostsynaptic calcium (Ca2+) signals couple synaptic transmission and neuronal \nexcitation to complex intracellular biochemical signals and transduction pathways. \nOf particular interest are Ca2+ accumulations in dendrites and dendritic spines. Spine \nCa2+ accumulations trigger long-term-potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) of \nsynaptic transmission (75). They also trigger structural plasticity of dendritic spines \n(123), activate transcriptional programs (30), and induce cytotoxicity (114). How \ndoes one second messenger participate in these disparate functions? \n \nThe diverse functions of Ca2+ can likely be attributed in part to the diverse \nmolecular pathways underlying Ca2+ influx. Depending on the stimulus conditions, \nCa2+ can enter the spine cytoplasm through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels \n(VSCCs), synaptic glutamate receptors, Ca-induced Ca2+ release and other pathways. \nIn addition, Ca2+ signals with different amplitudes and durations likely have different \nmeanings for postsynaptic signal transduction. The dynamics of spine Ca2+ signals \ndepend on the properties of the Ca2+ sources, on the concentration and affinity of \nendogenous Ca2+ buffers, the efficiency of Ca2+ extrusion, and the local morphology \nof the spine and surrounding dendrite. \n \nThe advent of two-photon excitation laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) (16) \nhas allowed high-resolution imaging in intact brain slices and even in the intact \nbrain.

We begin by reviewing general and cell-type specific aspects of Ca2+ \nsignals in mammalian central nervous system neurons. We then discuss the methods \nused for measuring Ca2+ signals in neuronal microcompartments, with a particular \nemphasis on their limitations. \n \n \nFig. 1. Simultaneous TPLSM [Ca2+] Imaging and TPPR of Glutamate at Single Spines. Ca2+ \ninflux was through NMDARs. (a) A neuron loaded with a high-affinity [Ca2+] indicator (Fluo-\n5F; green) and a Ca2+-insensitive fluorophore (Alexa 594; red). (b) Time-lapse image of a \nregion of interest (white arrow in (A)). TPPR of glutamate is indicated by the white bar (top, \nleft) and occurred immediately after the first image. Two regions of interest are also shown. \n(c) NMDA-receptor-mediated current measured using a somatic whole cell pipette (black) and \nchanges in calcium concentration (boxes in b). Under these conditions ΔG/R = 1 corresponds \nto [Ca2+] = 220 nM. Note that the dendritic Ca2+ accumulations are due to the presence of the \nhigh-affinity indicator, which slows the extrusion of Ca2+ and facilitates the spread of Ca2+ \n(Equation (1)). Adapted from (100). \n2 General Classes of Postsynaptic Ca2+ Signals \n2.1 Back-Propagating Action Potentials \nIn most vertebrate neurons, action potentials are generated near the soma and \nactively propagate down the axon. In many classes of neurons, the action potential \nalso invades and propagates through at least the proximal portion of the dendritic \narbor. These “back-propagating action potentials (bAPs)” open voltage-sensitive"}
{"text": "===== Page 3 =====\nCa2+ Signaling in Dendritic Spines\n443\n \nCa2+ channels (VSCCs), triggering Ca2+ entry into the dendrite and spines. The \nmagnitude and kinetics of bAP-mediated Ca2+ transients as well as the distance that \nthe bAP propagates into the dendrite varies among different classes of neurons. \nFurthermore, the classes of VSCCs that are expressed differ between the dendrite \nshaft and spine, between basal and apical dendrites, and between neurons classes. \n \nNevertheless, bAP-evoked Ca2+ transients share common features across \nneurons. Because the duration of the bAP is typically brief and because VSCC \nactivation and deactivation kinetics are fast, bAPs evoke short-lived Ca2+ currents \n(~1 ms). Indeed, the rising phases of bAP-evoked Ca2+ transients in dendrite shafts \nand in spines is so brief that they must result from the opening of voltage-sensitive \nCa2+ channels (VSCCs) directly in both compartments (e.g. (124)). Pharmacological \nanalysis has identified multiple classes of VSCCs in spines with the exact \ncomplement of channels varying both by cell type and species (8, 12, 21, 40, 89, 95, \n122). The functional relevance of bAP triggered activation of VSCCs is unclear, but, \nas discussed below, opening of VSCCs on the spine head can activate Ca-dependent \nsignaling cascades that regulate other ion channels expressed in the spine (8, 122). \n2.2 Synaptically-Evoked Ca2+ Transients \nGlutamatergic synapses typically contain at least one class of ionotropic glutamate \nreceptor that is Ca2+ permeable. This can be NMDA-type glutamate receptors \n(NMDARs), which efficiently conduct Ca, or certain isoforms of AMPA (AMPARs) \nand Kainate-type glutamate receptors (KRs) that, depending on their subunit \ncomposition, can be Ca2+ permeable. In addition, metabotropic-glutamate receptors \n(mGluRs) may also be expressed at synapses. These G-protein coupled receptors \n(GPCRs) typically signal through Gq-type G-proteins and phospholipase C (PLC) to \ntrigger the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. \n \nSynaptically-evoked Ca2+ transients are spatially and temporally complex \ncompared to those evoked by bAPs (17, 124). Since Ca2+ entry is spatially \ninhomogeneous – i.e. it occurs at active synapses but neither in the remainder of the \ndendrite nor in inactive spines – [Ca] gradients are present along the dendrite. In \nspiny neurons, the thin spine neck (see Chapter by Harris) posses a significant barrier \nto diffusion that restricts synaptically-evoked Ca2+ increases to the head of the active \nspine (59, 87, 104). In aspiny neurons, synaptically-evoked Ca2+ increases are \nrestricted to small stretches of dendrites in the immediate vicinity of active synapses \ndue to the action of low-mobility Ca-binding proteins, efficient Ca2+ clearance, and \nother specializations of the dendrite (31, 102). \n \nBecause of its relevance to the induction of synaptic plasticity, NMDAR-\ndependent Ca2+ signaling has been extensively studied (Fig. 1). NMDARs typically \nbind glutamate with high-affinity and therefore stay open for ~100 ms (50), \ngenerating prolonged Ca2+ increases in the spine head (58, 125). NMDAR opening \ndepends not only on glutamate binding but is also regulated by extracellular Mg ions \nthat transiently enter and exit the conduction pore and provide a flickering, voltage-\ndependent block of the channel (64, 80). For this reason, NMDAR conductance at \ntypical resting potentials is reduced ~20 fold compared that in the absence of \nextracellular Mg. However, because the block by Mg is incomplete and the driving"}

Svoboda \n \nforce for Ca2+ entry is very large, NMDAR mediated Ca2+ transients in active spines \nreach ~ 1 μM even in neurons at resting potentials and in the presence of normal \nextracellular Mg (90). Furthermore, the voltage-dependence of Mg block makes Ca2+ \ninflux through NMDARs dependent on the local, subthreshold changes in membrane \npotential and sensitive to the activity of AMPARs, voltage-sensitive Na and Ca2+ \nchannels, and Ca-activated K channels near or in the postsynaptic terminal (8, 21, 48, \n76, 78). Lastly, if synaptic stimulation is followed shortly by a bAP, Mg block of the \nNMDAR is further relieved and Ca2+ influx through the receptor is accentuated (12, \n46, 57, 76, 77, 124). However, because the bAP is brief and the kinetics of Mg block \nare rapid, this effect is transient and contributes a rapid, pulse-like increase in Ca2+ \ninflux through the NMDAR. Conversely, a bAP that arrives shortly before a synaptic \nstimulus can suppress synaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals in spines (46, 76), although \nthe effect is small. \n \nThese nonlinear effects on Ca2+ signals of closely timed synaptic stimuli and \nbAPs may be necessary for “spike-timing dependent plasticity” (STDP) generated by \npairing protocols (reviewed (14)). This form of plasticity has been demonstrated in a \nvariety of neurons including hippocampal (7, 15), layer 5 and 2/3 (25, 29, 61) \n \nCa-permeable AMPARs may also contribute to synaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals \nin a variety of non-pyramidal cell types (12, 102, 116). AMPARs lacking the GluR2 \nsubunit have high Ca2+ permeability compared to receptors that contain this subunit \n(37, 39, 42, 96). Ca-permeable AMPARs are not found in all neurons and are even \ndifferentially expressed in synapses of individual neurons (81, 110). Furthermore, \neven in neurons that express GluR2, highly Ca-permeable GluR2-lacking AMPARs \nmay still form and endow spines with AMPAR-mediated synaptic Ca2+ signals. For \n2.3 General Mechanisms of Ca2+ Clearance and Sequestration \nThe resting level of free Ca2+ in neurons is on the order of 100 nM and is set by the \nbalance of Ca2+ influx and efflux. When Ca2+ is increased beyond the resting level \nnet extrusion of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm occurs through one of several mechanisms. \nATP-utilizing transporters pump Ca2+ across the plasmamembrane and out of the cell \n(plasmamembrane Ca2+ ATPase, PMCA) or across the ER membrane and into its \nlumen (smooth endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase, SERCA). In addition, the \nCa/Na exchanger uses net influx of Na to power the extrusion of Ca2+ and may \ncontribute not only to the clearance of Ca2+ but to the accumulation of Na following \nstrong activity (84). Once Ca2+ enters the cytoplasm, most of it is rapidly bound by \nCa2+ binding proteins. The concentrations and affinities of Ca2+ binding proteins vary \n \npyramidal neurons as well as in striatal medium spiny (28), cortical layer 4 (20), and \ndorsal cochlear nucleus neurons (113). In general, LTP is triggered if the synaptic \nactivity consistently precedes bAPs by <10 ms, whereas LTD occurs if the bAP \nprecedes the synaptic activity by less than ~100 ms (25, 55, 57, 61, 118, 119, 126) \n(however see (20, 113) for exceptions). \nexample, in striatal medium spiny neurons, which express GluR2, a subpopulation of \nCa-permeable AMPARs contribute a small fraction of the total synaptic current but \nmediate a large fraction of synaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals (12)."}
{"text": "===== Page 5 =====\nCa2+ Signaling in Dendritic Spines\n445\n \nfrom neuron to neuron and even within different regions of the cell. For example, in \napical dendritic spines of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons ~25 ions of Ca2+ are \nbound by protein for every one that remains free whereas in the cell body and apical \ndendrite the ratio is closer to 100:1 (60, 90). As explained in the Perturbations due to \nCa2+ indicators section below, the ratio of bound to free Ca2+ is referred to as the \n“Ca2+ binding ratio” and affects the amplitude and time course of intracellular Ca2+ \ntransients as well as the diffusion of Ca2+ within the cytoplasm. \n3 Cell-Type Specific Features of Ca2+ Signaling \n3.1 Pyramidal Neurons \nIn pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus and cortex, activation of the synapse \nassociated with an individual dendritic spine leads to Ca2+ accumulation that is \nlimited to the spine head (48, 58, 70, 79, 87, 100, 124, 125). These synaptically-\nevoked Ca2+ signals are principally mediated by NMDARs and are largely \neliminated by pharmacological antagonists of these receptors (48, 58, 87, 125). \nSynaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals have been most extensively examined in spines of \nCA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons and results from studies of these cells will be \nused for the discussion in this section. In these cells, the amplitude and kinetics of \nsynaptically-evoked spine head Ca2+ signals are determined by the properties and \nnumbers of NMDARs present in the postsynaptic terminal as well as by the \nmembrane potential, the activity of kinases and phosphatases, and the opening of \nother ion channels in the active spine. \n \nNMDARs are heteromers of NR1 and NR2 subunits, and the subunit \ncomposition of the receptor strongly influences synaptic Ca2+ signals. In rat CA1 \npyramidal neurons, NMDARs containing NR1 and NR2A or NR2B subunits are \ntypically found in spines and at synapses. The contributions of NR2A and NR2B \ncontaining receptors to NMDAR-dependent currents and spine head Ca2+ transients \nvary widely from spine to spine (100). Since NR2B-containing NMDARs deactivate \nmore slowly (67), contribute relatively more Ca2+ to synaptically-evoked Ca2+ \ntransients (100), and are coupled to different downstream signaling systems than \nNR2A-containing receptors (3, 101), this heterogeneity may allow NMDAR opening \nto have different functional implications for plasticity induction (4, 52, 62) (but see \n(5, 69)). Once incorporated into the synapse, the Ca2+ permeability of NMDARs is \nalso regulated on a fast timescale by phosphorylation. For example, PKA activity \nenhances the Ca2+ permeability of both NR2A and NR2B containing receptors (99) \nand repetitive activation of NR2B-containing NMDARs activates a serine/threonine \nphosphatase that acts within an inhibitory regulatory loop to decreases Ca2+ \npermeability of NMDARs (101). \n \nSynaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons cells \nare also shaped by the activity and properties of ion channels other than NMDARs. \nSeveral studies have shown that blocking AMPARs reduces synaptically-evoked \nCa2+ signals in active spines (23, 48) (although see (58)). Since Ca-permeable \nAMPARs are typically not found at synapses made onto pyramidal neurons"}
{"text": "===== Page 6 =====\n446 \nB.L. Sabatini and K. Svoboda \n \n(although see (83, 109)), these effects suggest that the spine is sufficiently \ndepolarized during the synaptic potential to reduce the efficacy of Mg-block of the \nNMDAR, thereby enhancing Ca2+ entry. \n \nDepolarization in the spine head also activates VSCCs that contribute directly to \nspine head Ca2+ transients and indirectly shape synaptic signals. In mouse \nhippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons blockade of L-type VSCCs reduces spine head \nCa2+ transients evoked by 2-photon glutamate uncaging, suggesting that these \nchannels contribute to synaptically-evoked Ca2+ transients (8). In these same cells, \nR-type VSCCs are found selectively on the spine and not in the dendrite and their \nblockade leads to a counter-intuitive increase in the amplitude of spine head Ca2+ \ntransients and somatic synaptic potentials. This phenomenon is explained by the \npresence of an inhibitory regulatory mechanism in which Ca2+ influx through R-type \nVSCCs activates SK-type Ca-activated K channels which repolarize the spine and \ntruncate Ca2+ influx through NMDARs (8, 78). Interestingly, the properties of R and \nL-type VSCCs in the spine head can be quickly modulated and may offer points of \nregulation of synaptic signals. In rat CA1 pyramidal neurons L-type VSCCs opening \nis revealed by activation of noradrenergic receptors (38) whereas activation of L-type \nVSCCs during prolonged bAP trains reduces the opening probability of R-type \nVSCCs (122). \n \nHowever, conclusions drawn from the analysis of one class of pyramidal neuron \nin one species should not be considered to be generally applicable. Thus, although \nspines of mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons express L-type VSCCs whose \n \ninflux through these channels is not detectable in spines of rat CA1 pyramidal \nneurons in the basal state (38, 89). Similarly, contributions of N and P/Q-type \nVSCCs to spine Ca2+ signals are seen in rat cortical layer 5 and mouse CA1 \nhippocampal pyramidal neurons but not in rat CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons \n(8, 89, 95, 122). Furthermore, the contribution of Ca2+ release from intracellular \nstores to synaptic signals in pyramidal neurons in controversial. Endoplasmic \nreticulum (ER) is a prominent internal Ca2+ store found in many spines in \nhippocampal pyramidal neurons (2, 103), with ryanodine receptors (RyRs) found in \nboth dendrites and spines, and IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) restricted to dendrites (6, 97). A \nsubset of studies have found that NMDAR activation triggers Ca2+ release from \ninternal Ca2+ stores (1, 23), possibly via Ca-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). However, \nthis contribution may depend on the recording conditions or experimental \npreparation, having been described in organotypic slices (23) but not in acute slices \n(48, 58, 87). Other studies have found that combinations of strong synaptic \nstimulation, bAPs trains, and GPCR activation can trigger waves of Ca2+ release \nfrom intracellular stores in the apical dendrite (72, 73). \n3.2 Purkinje Cells \nCerebellar Purkinje Cells (PCs) have large dendrites with a very high density of \nspines and receive >100,000 glutamatergic synapses from parallel fibers (PFs), the \naxons of granule cells (98). In addition, mature PCs receive a powerful input from a \nsingle climbing fiber, the terminal axon of a neuron in the inferior olive. \nopening contributes to both bAP- and synaptically-evoked Ca2+ transients (8), Ca2+"}
{"text": "===== Page 7 =====\nCa2+ Signaling in Dendritic Spines\n447\n \nSynaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals in PCs dendrites have been extensively studied and \nfound to be fundamentally different than those in pyramidal neurons. Mature PCs \nlack functional NMDARs (24, 82), and PF-evoked Ca2+ signals are instead mediated \nby activation of synaptic AMPARs and mGluRs. Furthermore, PF-evoked Ca2+ \nsignals in PC dendrites vary dramatically in amplitude and spatial extent depending \non the strength of stimulation (35, 65). Weak synaptic stimulation triggers fast Ca2+ \nsignals that are localized to individual spines and are mediated either by direct Ca2+ \ninflux through AMPARs or by activation of VSCCs in the spine triggered by the \nsynaptic potential (17). Stronger stimulation, such as brief trains of subthreshold PF \ninput, produces biphasic Ca2+ transients in individual spines or small stretches of \ndendrites and the additional slow component is blocked by mGluR or IP3R \nantagonists (27, 107). Similar, prolonged dendritic Ca2+ transients can be evoked by \ndirect activation of mGluRs or intracellular generation of IP3 and are mediated by \nCa2+ release from internal stores (44, 53). Purkinje cells have ER in dendrites and \nspines and express IP3Rs and RyRs in dendrites as well as IP3Rs in spines (6, 34, 93, \n115). Brief trains of PF activity also induce, in a Ca-dependent manner, production \nof endocannabinoids in the PC dendrite which signal retrogradely to reduce \nprobability of glutamate release from the presynaptic bouton (10, 11). Lastly, strong \nparallel fiber stimulation triggers dendritic spikes and large Ca2+ signals that are \nmediated by VSCCs and extend through larger portions of the dendrite (22). \n \nIn contrast to the graded nature of PF responses, activation of the CF input \nelicits a complex spike in the PC and a widespread Ca2+ signal in the proximal \ndendrites (85). CF-evoked Ca2+ signals are blocked by AMPAR antagonists, and are \nmediated by VSCCs (45, 47, 65). CF stimulation, when paired with stimulation of PF \nstimulation, nonlinearly boosts synaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals in the regions of \ndendrite containing active PF inputs (10, 117). Although CF stimulation alone is \ninsufficient to trigger endocannibinoid release, this pairing protocol elevates \nintracellular Ca2+ to levels that trigger production and release of endocannabinoids \nfrom the PC (9, 10). The mechanism by which pairing CF inputs with weak PF \nstimulation generates supralinear Ca2+ signals is unclear and may include saturation \nof Ca2+ binding proteins in the dendrite (56). A contribution of release of Ca2+ \nrelease from internal stores has been reported in a study that focused on signaling \nwithin spines (27, 117) whereas other studies have reported no contribution of Ca2+ \nrelease (10). \n \nRepetitive, paired activation of CF and PF induces long-term depression (LTD) \nof active PF to PC synapses (41, 51). LTD induction requires Ca2+ signaling, is \nabolished by blocking mGluRs, depleting internal Ca2+ stores, or interfering with \nendocannabinoid mediated signaling (27, 43, 91, 92, 117). \n3.3 Other Spiny Neurons \nSynaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals in several other cell types have also been \nexamined, including layer 4 spiny stellate cells (76), striatal medium spiny neurons \n(12), olfactory bulb granule cells (21) and lateral amygdala projection neurons (40). \nIn the somatosensory cortex, the spines of layer 4 spiny stellate cells display \nsynaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals mediated by NMDARs (76). While blocking"}

Svoboda \n \nAMPARs in these cells also reduces the synaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals, this is \nthought to be due to the elimination of relief of Mg block of the NMDARs. In \ncontrast, medium spiny neurons in the striatum have synaptically-evoked Ca2+ \nsignals in spines that are mediated by both Ca-permeable AMPARs and NMDARs \n(12). In these cells, both AMPAR and NMDAR Ca2+ signals are strongly influenced \nsubthreshold shifts in the resting membrane potential. These depolarizations decrease \nthe AMPAR Ca2+ signal due a decreased driving force for Ca2+ entry, and increase \nthe NMDAR Ca2+ signal via relief of Mg block. Finally, granule cells in the olfactory \nbulb have synaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals at dendrodendritic synapses mediated by \na variety of Ca2+ sources, including NMDARs, T-type channels and release from \ninternal Ca2+ stores (21) \n4 Measuring Spine Ca2+ Signals \nCa2+ imaging has revolutionized our understanding of Ca2+ signaling in neurons. Ca2+ \nimaging in spines has been made possible by the development of fluorescent Ca2+ \nindicators (reviewed in (112)) and microscopy methods that allow high-resolution \nand high-sensitivity imaging (reviewed in (19)). Cooled CCD cameras and confocal \nmicroscopy for the first time allowed the imaging of Ca2+ changes in single dendritic \nspines in cultured neurons (71). However, synapses ultimately need to be studied in \nintact tissues, such as brain slices or whole animals. Scattering by neural tissue \nseverely degrades contrast and resolution in wide-field and confocal microscopy. \nThe problems posed by scattering can be overcome by two-photon excitation laser \nscanning microscopy (TPLSM) (16) (reviewed in (105)). TPLSM can resolve \nindividual spines in brain slices (19) and even in the intact brain (18, 49). TPLSM \ncan be combined with fluorescent Ca2+ indicators to image Ca2+ dynamics in \nneuronal microcompartments, including spines (124) and presynaptic terminals (13) \nin intact tissues. \n \nCa2+ imaging has been used to measure the time-course of Ca2+ signals in \nresponse to physiological stimuli. However, since Ca2+ indicators are Ca2+ buffers, \n \nindicators are non-linear Ca2+ sensors with limited dynamic ranges. A critical \nassessment of results derived with Ca2+ imaging in dendritic spines must take the \nlimitations of Ca2+ imaging into account. \n4.1 Resolution Limits \nTPLSM can resolve objects ~0.5 micrometers apart, sufficient to isolate fluorescence \nsignals arising from most spines without crosstalk with other spines and the parent \ndendrite (105). For example, Ca2+ signals in “mushroom” and “thin” spines can be \nisolated (definitions of spine types are from (33)). However, the length of “stubby \nspines”, which lack spine necks, is on the order of the resolution limit of TPLSM, \nmaking them impossible to resolve from their parent dendrite. In addition, the lack of \na spine neck makes the delineation of spine head and dendrite arbitrary. For stubby \nspines, fluorescence signals from spine and dendrite will thus be mixed. \ntheir presence\ndistorts the Ca2+ signals (36, 60, 74, 88). Furthermore, Ca2+ \n–"}

The excitation volume is on the order of the size of typical spine heads \n(33). Using standard synthetic Ca2+ indicators, TPLSM is therefore insensitive to the \nstrong Ca2+ gradients that must exist in dendritic spines. Over the last few years it \nhas become clear that Ca2+ gradients, over length scales of nanometers, may be a \ncritical determinant of Ca-dependent signaling. In particular, molecular Ca2+ sensors, \nsuch as calmodulin, are often fixed in Ca2+ microdomains close to a particular Ca2+ \nsources, such as voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs). For example, these \nmolecular level interactions determine the VSCC response to intracellular Ca2+ (68). \nThe length scales of Ca2+ microdomains (nanometers) are therefore 10–100 times \n4.2 Ca2+ Indicator Calibration \nStandard Ca2+ indicators consist of a fluorophore coupled to a Ca2+ buffer, such as \nethylenedioxybis(o-phenylenenitrilo) tetraacetic acid (BAPTA). Ca2+ binding \nchanges the fluorescence properties of the indicator (typically the fluorescence yield \nincreases). A large number of Ca2+ indicators, with differing Kd and dynamic range, \nhave become available. The choice of the particular indicator must be made on the \nbasis of the amplitude and time-course of the Ca2+ signal to be studied. \n \nFor quantitative experiments it is important to operate in the linear range of the \nindicator. Nonlinearities cause difficulties in quantifying [Ca], buffering capacities, \nand biologically interesting fluctuations in [Ca] (89). The fractional nonlinearity \n(NL) is given by ~ [Ca]/Kd. Therefore, when [Ca] <<KD, the fluorescence intensity \nis proportional to [Ca]. Similarly, to limit NL to less than 20%, [Ca] should not \nexceed ~ KD/5. It is best practice to express Ca2+ transient amplitudes in fractional \nunits, where “1” corresponds to saturating Ca2+ (8, 94, 101). \n4.3 Perturbations Due to Ca2+ Indicators \nCa2+ signals in cells are shaped by the Ca2+ sources, Ca2+ buffers, and Ca2+ clearance \nmechanisms (36, 60, 74, 88, 108). Since Ca2+ indicators themselves are Ca2+ buffers \ntheir presence perturbs Ca2+ signals and downstream signals. Measuring Ca2+ \ntherefore invariably perturbs Ca2+ signals and Ca2+ signaling. \n \nA variety of Ca2+ indicators are available to measure Ca2+ over many orders of \nmagnitude in concentration. The perturbing effects of Ca2+ buffers can be summarized \nby the buffer binding ratio (κ), the fraction of the total Ca2+ entering the cell that is \nbound to buffers. For buffer X, κx is approximately equal to the concentration of the \nbuffer divided by its dissociation constant for Ca2+ (κx = [X]/Kd,x). \nsmaller than the resolution limit of optical microscopy. \n \nAction potential-evoked evoked Δ[Ca] can be measured using a variety of \nindicators, but only low affinity indicators (e.g. Fluo-4FF, X-Rhod-FF) are \nappropriate for quantitative measurements of the larger NMDA-mediated [Ca] \naccumulations. Higher Ca2+ indicator concentrations lead to smaller changes in [Ca], \nand therefore also tend to improve linearity, but at the expense of decreasing signal-\nto-noise ratio (SNR). Supposedly quantitative Ca2+ imaging studies that do not treat \nindicator non-linearities explicitly should be viewed with skepticism."}
{"text": "===== Page 10 =====\n450 \nB.L. Sabatini and K. Svoboda \n \n \nThe binding ratios for endogenous buffers (κB) are on the order of 100, but can \nrange from 20 in small pyramidal dendrites and spines (90) up to more than 1,000 in \nPurkinje neurons (26). The buffer added by the indicator (κi) is typically on the order \nthe measured Ca2+ signal. In most experiments the indicator dominates intracellular \nbuffers, markedly reducing the amplitudes and prolonging the durations of [Ca] \ntransients (86, 90, 121). A variety of schemes have been used to correct for the \npresence of Ca2+ indicators and thereby calculate Ca2+ dynamics in the absence of \nCa2+ indicators (36, 60, 90). However, these schemes generally are applicable only to \nconditions in which spatial Ca2+ gradients are negligible. This might apply for \nsituations in which Ca2+ signals are relatively global and in which Ca2+ dynamics can \nbe described by single-compartment models (e.g. action potential-evoked Ca2+ \ndynamics). The vast majority of Ca2+ imaging studies are performed in the regime κI \n>> κB. This means that nearly all Ca2+ ions entering the cell bind to the indicator, and \nchanges in fluorescence are proportional to the total amount of Ca2+ entering the cell \n(i.e. the charge). Very few studies have seriously attempted to correct for the \n \nIn the presence of Ca2+ gradients, Ca2+ indicators can have highly perturbative \nand non-intuitive effects. In particular, Ca2+ indicators can dramatically accelerate \nthe transport of Ca. Transport of Ca2+ is characterized by an effective diffusion \ncoefficient, Deff, which depends on the diffusion coefficients of free Ca2+ (DCa), and \nCa2+ bound to mobile buffers (Dm) and indicator (Di): \ni\nm\nB\ni\ni\nm\nm\nCa\neff\nD\nD\nD\nD\nκ\nκ\nκ\nκ\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\n1\n  \n \n \n \n \n(1) \n4.4 Genetically Encoded Ca2+ Indicators \nGenetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (GECIs) have the potential to overcome some of \nthe limitations of synthetic indicators (66). GECIs could be used to reduce the effect \nof Ca2+ indicators on Ca2+ spread. For example, GECIs could be fused to actin, \nwhich is concentrated in spines and stable over the time scales relevant to Ca2+ \naccumulations. Alternatively, GECIs could be used to selectively read out Ca2+ \nentering neurons through particular channels. For example, low-affinity GECIs could \nof κi ~ 500 (100 µM of Oregon Green Bapta-1 or Fluo-4). The relative magnitudes of \nκi and κB determine the extent to which the presence of the Ca2+ indicator perturbs \nindicator and extrapolate to κI = 0 (e.g. 87). \nκ\nendogenous buffers seem to be largely immobile (κm≈0). Equation (1) therefore \nimplies that even in situations of “low added buffer” (κi ≤ κB), where [Ca] \namplitudes and extrusion rates are relatively unperturbed, the spread of Ca2+ can still \nbe highly distorted. The presence of indicator rapidly breaks down micrometer-level \ndendritic [Ca] gradients and thus accelerates equilibration of [Ca] between spine and \ndendrite (Fig. 1c). Conclusions about the spread of Ca2+ based on Ca2+ imaging \ntherefore need to be viewed with great skepticism. For example, the slight spread of \nCa2+ observed in Fig. 1b,c can be attributed to the presence of the indicator. \n \nHere κB represents the strength of immobile buffers (DB = 0).

Under the appropriate \nconditions (distance between GECI and the mouth of the channel, affinity between \nGECI and Ca2+) GECIs would only respond to Ca2+ entering the cell through the \ntagged channel. However, current GECIs are inferior Ca2+ sensors compared to \nsynthetic indicators, producing smaller and slower responses, limiting their use in \nsmall compartments such as dendritic spines. Furthermore, their responses to Ca2+ \nare complex and non-linear, which may make quantitative Ca2+ measurements \nchallenging (121). \n4.5 Two-Photon Glutamate Uncaging \nAnalysis of spine Ca2+ signaling has benefited from combining TPLSM and two-\nphoton photorelease (TPPR) of caged glutamate (63). One laser is used to trigger \nphotolysis of caged glutamate while a second is used for Ca2+ imaging (12, 54, 100) \n(Fig. 1). Using this approach, the postsynaptic terminal on a spine can be stimulated \nwhile the evoked signals are monitored. Furthermore, combined TPLSM and TPPR \nallow analysis of postsynaptic signaling using perturbations that might affect the \npresynaptic terminal. TPPR on single spines can produce postsynaptic currents with \namplitudes and time-courses that mimic unitary synaptic currents (12, 63). \n \nHowever, several limitations of this approach must be considered. Glutamate is \nuncaged throughout the two-photon excitation volume and may spread further by \ndiffusion before binding to glutamate receptors. The effective volume of TPPR (~1 \nfL) is therefore far larger than the synaptic cleft. A different set of receptors, \nincluding extrasynaptic receptors, may therefore be activated with TPPR compared \nto synaptic transmission. This problem is exacerbated if the duration of the uncaging \nlaser pulse is more than a few hundred microseconds. \n \nA related issue is that the efficiency of glutamate receptor activation falls off \nrelatively slowly with distance from the spine, with a length constant of ~1 μm (100). \nDendritic spines need to be chosen for stimulation that are well-separated from other \nspines, biasing the sample. When stimulating short spines, such as stubby spines, \nglutamate receptors on the shaft may also be activated. \n \nLastly, control of the laser pulse duration and power allows the production of a \nbroad range of spatio-temporal glutamate concentration profiles. It is important to \navoid strong stimuli that might uncover phenomena that have no physiological \nrelevance. It is critical to calibrate and standardize the amount of glutamate released \nonto spines at different depths and in varying optical environments (e.g. (8)). \n5 Conclusions and Outlook \nThe development of Ca2+ indicators and high-resolution imaging methods have \nrevolutionized our understanding of neuronal Ca2+ signaling. In a number of systems, \nand under a variety of physiologically relevant conditions, we understand how Ca2+ \nenters spines. We also understand what fraction of Ca2+ binds to buffers and how \nCa2+ is eventually cleared from the neuronal cytoplasm. However, we know \nrelatively little about the dynamics and roles of the fast nanometer sized Ca2+"}

Hell \n \n1 Introduction \nThe discovery of an unsuspected number of protein-protein interactions during the \npast 15 years was an eye opener for the unanticipated detailed spatial and functional \norganization of proteins inside cells. Colocalization of protein kinases and \nphosphatases with their regulators and substrates is of special interest because it is \ncritical for swift, effective, and specific signaling (189). At the plasma membrane a \nnumber of extracellular signals are relayed with high selectivity to specific \nintracellular signaling pathways. Synapses are rather small subcellular compartments \nthat fulfill multiple functions: signal transmission between neurons, processing of \nneuronal signals, and storage of information. Targeting mechanisms for kinases and \nphosphatases are thus particularly important at synapses to ensure spatial and \ntemporal fidelity of signal transduction. Such targeting is not limited to kinases but \noften includes upstream regulators and downstream effectors of kinases. For \ninstance, PKA forms a signaling complex with the postsynaptic L-type Ca2+ channel \nCav1.2 that contains all elements of the classic β-adrenergic – PKA signaling \ncascade including the β2 adrenergic receptor, the trimeric G protein Gs, and adenylyl \ncyclase (55, 93). Upon activation of the β2 adrenergic receptor and the ensuing \ncAMP production, PKA phosphorylates Cav1.2 to increase its Ca2+ channel activity. \nDespite involving the diffusible second messenger cAMP, signaling from the β2 \nformation of a supramolecular signaling complex (55). \n \nThis chapter describes the molecular basis and functional relevance of \npostsynaptic kinase and phosphatase anchoring at glutamatergic synapses.

Hell \n2.1.3 Molecular Mechanisms of Postsynaptic CaMKII Accumulation \n \n  \nCaMKII binding proteins that are specifically concentrated at postsynaptic sites are \nthe NMDA receptor, densin-180, F-actin, and α-actinin (Table 1). The NMDA \nreceptor consists of two NR1 and two NR2 subunits, the latter encoded by four \ngenes (NR2A – NR2D) (Chapters by Yuan et al. and Wenthold et al., this volume). \nThe prevailing NR2 subunits in mammalian forebrain are NR2A and NR2B. \nCaMKII interacts with NR1 (19, 122, 124, 161), NR2A (81, 83), and NR2B  \n(19, 122, 124, 228, 229). The CaMKII binding site on NR1 is formed by residues \n847–861 constituting the C-terminal half of the so-called C0 domain with residues \n849–857 being most critical for the interaction (122) (Leonard and Hell, \nunpublished) (Fig. 1b). CaMKII independently binds to the membrane-proximal \nresidues 839–1120 (NR2B/P) and residues 1290–1310 in the 644 amino acid-long \nC-terminus of NR2B (Fig. 1b) (19, 124, 228, 229). The NR2A region that is nearly \nidentical to NR2B/C does not bind CaMKII because of the insertion of two vicinal \nresidues (Ile-Asp) right in the middle of this motif (15, 83, 229). However, a region \nfurther downstream has been reported to interact with CaMKII, with residues 1412–\n1419 forming the core of this interaction site (80, 82). Phosphorylation of S1303 in \nNR2B/C by CaMKII and of S1415 in NR2A by PKC inhibits CaMKII association \nwith these sites (80, 229). \n \n \nFig. 1. (Continued) (a) Linear model of CaMKII and binding to α-actinin and densin-180. The \ncatalytic domain of CaMKII (red) contains the ATP binding site, the substrate binding site  \n(S site), and the hydrophobic pocket (T site), which interacts with T286 under resting \nconditions. The T286 segment (brown; T287 in CaMKIIβ) and pseudosubstrate region \n(orange) form the autoinhibitory domain, which binds to the T and S site, respectively, in the \nbasal inactive state. 12 subunits interact with their C-terminal association domains (green) to \nform one CaMKII complex. The pseudosubstrate region (orange) overlaps with the Ca2+/CaM \nbinding site (yellow). Autophosphorylation of T305 or T306 blocks Ca2+/CaM binding. α-\nactinin consists of two calponin-homology domains (CH1, CH2), four spectrin repeats (SR1-\n4), two EF hands and a C-terminal region. It binds with its C-terminal region to the catalytic \ndomain and possibly the Ca2+/CaM binding site of CaMKII. Densin-180 carries a PDZ \ndomain at its N-terminus that interacts with the very C-terminal ESDL sequence of α-actinin. \nThe membrane-proximal region of densin-180 is differentially spliced and binds to the \nassociation domain of CaMKII. It is followed by a transmembrane segment, a glycosylated \nregion, and a leucine-rich region (LRR). (b) CaMKII binding sites on NR1 and NR2B/C and \nPhosphorylation Targets stargazin and GluR1. CaMKII binds to the region surrounding \nSer1303 in the C-terminus of NR2B and to the C0 region in the C-terminus of NR1 (dark \nblue). Critical residues defined by binding studies with peptide libraries of overlapping \nsequences of NR1 C0 and by interaction studies with NR2B/C constructs carrying point \nmutations are given in white on black background. CaMKII can phosporylate S1303 in NR2B, \nS831 in GluR1 (blue) and 9 diferent serines in stargazin (light blue). (c) Interactions of CaM, \nα-actinin, and CaMKII with NR1 C0. Under resting conditions, NR1 C0 simultaneously binds \nto α-actinin and the C-domain of apo-CaM, with α-actinin preventing CaMKII binding.

These biochemical characteristics \nimmediately suggest that CaMKII binding to the NMDA receptor depends on Ca2+ \ninflux to allow Ca2+/CaM binding to CaMKII and T286 autophosphorylation of \nCaMKII (Section 2.1.4). The Kd values for CaMKII binding to NR1 and NR2B are \nin the high nM to low μM range (124, 225, 228), well below the average \nconcentration of CaMKII in neurons. Binding to NR2A is much weaker than to NR1 \nand NR2B and often hard to detect (124, 228, 229). \n \nThe C-terminal half of the NR1 C0 region interacts not only with CaMKII but \nalso with CaM and α-actinin (122). The CaMKII binding site partially overlaps with \nthe CaM/α-actinin binding site, the latter being C-terminally shifted by 3–4 residues \n(122). Ca2+ free (apo) CaM and α-actinin concurrently bind to NR1 C0 under basal \nconditions (2, 161). Addition of Ca2+ leads to displacement of α-actinin by \nCa2+/CaM from NR1 C0 (161, 266), which causes inactivation of the NMDA \nreceptor (118, 277), likely to limit excessive Ca2+ influx. It is currently unknown \nwhat role CaMKII binding to NR1 C0 plays. In vitro, NR1 C0 can simultaneously \nsupp. 180"}

We propose that under \nbasal conditions with low intracellular Ca2+, apo-CaM and α-actinin interact with \nNR1 C0. Ca2+ influx induces dislocation of α-actinin by Ca2+/CaM, which then \npermits binding of activated CaMKII to this site (Fig. 1c). \n \nDensin-180 selectively binds to CaMKIIα but not CaMKIIβ. Forebrain CaMKII \nholoenzymes, which contain on average 9α and 3β subunits, show little if any \nbinding to densin-180 (198, 255). Homomeric CaMKIIα holoenzymes could arise \nfrom local translation of CaMKIIα mRNA, which is present throughout dendrites in \ncontrast to CaMKIIβ mRNA (36). Association of CaMKIIα with densin-180 is \nstimulated by T286 autophosphorylation but does not strictly dependent on it (Kd is \n75–250 nM for T286-autophosphorylated CaMKII and likely more than 10 fold \nhigher for unphosphorylated CaMKII) (197, 230, 255). The association domain of \nCaMKIIα binds to residues 1331–1404 immediately upstream of the PDZ domain \nthat is located at the C-terminal end of densin-180 (198, 230, 255) (Fig. 1a). \n \nα-actinin is an F-actin binding protein concentrated at various cell adhesion \nsites including dendritic spines (182, 190, 254, 255, 266). The α-actinin family \ncomprises 4 genes encoding the highly homologous α-actinin-1 through -4. In \nforebrain neurons mRNA and protein are detectable for α-actinin-1, -2, and -4 but \nnot -3 (Schnizler, Hall, and Hell, unpublished results) (190, 254, 255, 266). α-\nactinins consist of two calponin homology domains, followed by four spectrin \nrepeats, two EF hand motifs, and a C-terminal tail (Fig. 1a). A fragment of CaMKII \nthat includes the catalytic and autoinhibitory domain binds to the C-terminal 74–76 \nresidues of α-actinin-2 and -4 immediately downstream of the two EF hand motifs \n(198, 255) (Fig. 1a). This CaMKII binding site on α-actinin is likely composed of \nnon-contiguous segments (198). Whether the extreme C-terminus of α-actinin is \nrequired for CaMKII binding is a matter of debate (198, 255). This segment and \nespecially the last four residues of α-actinin constitute a classical PDZ interaction \nmotif (ESDL-COO–; moieties critical for PDZ binding are in bold). This motif binds \nto the PDZ domain at the C-terminal end of densin-180 (198, 255). Densin-180 can \nthus provide an additional link that acts in a synergistic manner to promote CaMKII \n– α-actinin binding (198). \n \nT286 autophosphorylation does not modulate CaMKII binding to α-actinin. \nHowever, autophosphorylation of T305 and T306 in the Ca2+/CaM binding site of \nthe autoinhibitory domain of CaMKII abrogates CaMKII binding for α-actinin (197) \nas it does for Ca2+/CaM (47, 187). T305/306 phosphorylation can occur upon \nCa2+/CaM dissociation from T286 autophosphorylation CaMKII (161) or association \nwith Camguk/CASK (138) (see below). Furthermore, Ca2+/CaM binding to this \nautoinhibitory CaMKII segment and Ca2+/CaM-dependent CaMKII activity is \ncompetitively blocked by α-actinin indicating that α-actinin and Ca2+/CaM compete \nfor the same binding site on CaMKII (EC50 for α-actinin is ~1 μM) (197). Because \nthe affinity of Ca2+/CaM for T286-phosphorylated CaMKII is more than 1000 fold \nhigher than for unphosphorylated CaMKII (162), Ca2+/CaM competes most \neffectively with α-actinin for T286-phosphorylated CaMKII and much less so for \nunphosphorylated CaMKII (197)."}
{"text": "===== Page 7 =====\nPostsynaptic Targeting of Protein Kinases and Phosphatases\n465\n \n \nNR2B/C and α-actinin do not compete with each other or with densin-180 for \nCaMKII binding. Furthermore, monomeric CaMKII lacking the association domain, \nwhich mediates oligomerization of CaMKII and association with densin-180, is \ncapable of simultaneously binding NR2B/C and α-actinin-2. By forming \ndodecameric holoenzyme CaMKII can simultaneously bind multiple NR2B/C, \ndensin-180 or α-actinin-2 polypeptides; it can concomitantly interact with NR2B/C \nplus densin-180 or α-actinin and with densin-180 plus α-actinin (198, 255). CaMKII \ncould thus play a structural role at the postsynaptic site by forming multimeric \ncomplexes with NR2B/C, α-actinin, and densin-180 (198, 255). A non-catalytic role \nfor CaMKIIα was recently demonstrated in presynaptic events underlying short-term \npotentiation (99) and for CaMKIIβ in bundling F-actin in spines (177). \n \nCaMKIIβ binds with its variable region located between the autoinhibitory and \nassociation domain to F-actin, which is concentrated in dendritic spines (78, 214). \nThis segment is not conserved in CaMKIIα, which thus does not directly interact \nwith F-actin but can be recruited to cortical F-actin through CaMKIIβ if co-\nassembled into holomers. The F-actin binding segment of CaMKIIβ is located \nimmediately downstream of the Ca2+/CaM binding site in the CaMKII autoinhibitory \ndomain. Ca2+/CaM binding and T287 autophosphorylation leads to displacement of \nCaMKIIβ from F-actin (212, 214). As this interaction is very dynamic (212, 214) \nand inhibited by CaMKII activation, it cannot mediate activity-induced postsynaptic \nCaMKII accumulation. Nevertheless, it recruits CaMKIIβ to F-actin in spine shafts \n(176, 212), which could function to provide a readily available CaMKII pool for \nswift translocation to the PSD. Furthermore, recent work indicates that CaMKIIβ is \nimportant for maintaining dendritic spine structure by bundling F-actin with its F-\nactin binding domain in conjunction with the CaMKII association domain but \nindependent of the kinase domain (177). It seems F-actin and CaMKIIβ mutually \nsupport each others accumulation in spines. However, the strong rise in postsynaptic \nCaMKII signal following Ca2+ influx can only be explained by translocation of \nextrasynaptic CaMKII to spines (183, 212, 213) (see below and Fig. 2). \n \nAnother postsynaptic binding partner for CaMKII is Camguk (138). It is the \nDrosophila homolog of CASK, which consists of an N-terminal CaMKII-like \ndomain, followed by SH3, GK, and PDZ domains. The interaction of CaMKII with \nCamguk is enhanced by ATP if Ca2+/CaM is present and by non-hydrolizable ATP \nanalogues (138). Perhaps binding of ATP to CaMKII promotes initial Camguk \nbinding by fostering exposure of a Camguk binding site on CaMKII. With Ca2+/CaM \npresent, autophosphorylation of T287 in Drosophila CaMKII occurs in this complex. \nIn the absence of Ca2+/CaM, Camguk-associated CaMKII autophosphorylates on \nT306/307 without T287 autophosphorylation, which is normally required for \nT306/307 phosphorylation (T287/T306/T307 in Drosophila CaMKII are equivalent \nto T286/T305/T306 in mammalian CaMKIIα). T306/307 phosphorylation displaces \nCaMKII from Camguk. T306/307 phosphorylated CaMKII cannot bind Ca2+/CaM. \nAt quiescent synapses with little Ca2+/CaM present, Camguk can thus induce \nsilencing of CaMKII (138). At active synapses Ca2+/CaM can bind to T306/307, \nthereby inhibiting T306/307 phosphorylation and stabilizing the CaMKII-Camguk \ncomplex. CASK might perform a similar function in mammals but no evidence is \navailable."}

This chemically induced \nform of LTP increases the amount of CaMKII in a subcellular fraction that is \nenriched in postsynaptic densities (PSD) (227). Specific activation of Ca2+ influx \nthrough the NMDA receptor by NMDA in the presence of the Na+ channel blocker \ntetrodotoxin (97) augments CaMKII binding to the NMDA receptor NR1 and NR2B \nsubunit (124). NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx stimulates postsynaptic \naccumulation of ectopically expressed GFP-CaMKIIα as observed by live imaging \nin hippocampal cultures (183, 212, 213) and in zebrafish in vivo (87). GFP-tagged \nCaMKIIα and β have a pronounced tendency to cluster in neuronal somata and \ndendritic shafts under basal conditions (Chen and Hell, unpublished data). We tested \nwhether endogenous CaMKII undergoes activity-driven postsynaptic targeting. \nCaMKII is detectable in synapses under resting conditions likely due to basal \nNMDA receptor activity as postsynaptic CaMKII clustering is reduced by the \nNMDA receptor antagonist AP5 (Fig. 2). Short (60–90 s) application of glutamate \naugments synaptic accumulation of endogenous CaMKIIα and CaMKIIβ in \ndendritic spines as obvious from the enhanced CaMKII staining intensity at synapses \ncompared to the intensity in the dendritic shaft (Fig. 2). Glutamate-induced CaMKII \naccumulations colocalize with the presynaptic marker synapsin (Fig. 2) and with \nAMPA receptors, NMDA receptors, and PSD-95 (Chen and Hell, unpublished). \nCaMKII clustering is blocked by removal of extracellular Ca2+ and by the NMDA \nreceptor antagonist MK-801 (Chen and Hell, unpublished). An increase in \nendogenous CaMKIIα  immunoreactivity at the PSD is also detectable by \nimmunogold electron microscopy upon glutamate treatment of hippocampal cultures \nfor 90 s (69). \n \nOptimal CaMKII binding to the NMDA receptor and densin-180 requires Ca2+ \nfor Ca2+/CaM binding to CaMKII and ensuing T286 autophosphorylation and for \ndisplacement of α-actinin from NR1C0 (Section 2.1.3). Therefore, the NMDA \nreceptor and densin-180 are the prime candidates for mediating activity-driven \npostsynaptic CaMKII accumulation. These interactions strategically target CaMKII \nto postsynaptic sites that experience increased activation of NMDA receptors as \noccurring during LTP and other forms of synaptic plasticity. CaMKII thus \naccumulates at postsynaptic sites where Ca2+ influx through the NMDA receptor is \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2.

LTP specifically occurs at those \nsynapses that receive increased stimulation. Ca2+-induced binding supports CaMKII \naccumulation specifically at those synapses that undergo LTP. Such activity-driven \naccumulation is not only economical but likely also constitutes positive feedback \nthat ensures reliable and specific potentiation of stimulated synapses. \n \nPostsynaptic CaMKII accumulation might foster phosphorylation of the AMPA \nreceptor GluR1 subunit at S831 (Fig. 1b), which is elevated during LTP (16, 121). \nThis phosphorylation increases ion currents through homomeric GluR1 but not \nheteromeric GluR1/R2 receptors (61, 174). However, this phosphorylation likely \ncontributes only to a limited degree to LTP and only in mice that are 2 and perhaps \nmore than 7 weeks but not 3–4 weeks old. The reason for this limitation is that only \nat the former ages are GluR2-lacking, presumably GluR1 homomeric, AMPA \nreceptors functionally present and only transiently so during the first 20 min of LTP \n(1, 142, 193) (Chapter by Lisman and Hell, this volume). This constraint was met in \nprevious work showing an increase in AMPA receptor single channel conductivity \nfollowing LTP induction (25). It reduces the time window during which this \nregulation could contribute to potentiation and thereby establishment of LTP during \nits early phase. \n \nCaMKII also contributes to postsynaptic accumulation of GluR1-containing \nAMPA receptors (95, 201). CaMKII phosphorylation of stargazin (see Fig. 1b) (and \npotentially of its relatives γ3, γ4, γ7, γ8) recently emerged as an important molecular \nmechanism in LTP by fostering postsynaptic accumulation of AMPA receptors \n(244). Stargazin also positively modulates gating of AMPA receptors (194, 243, \n250) but it is unclear whether CaMKII regulates gating by phosphorylating \nstargazin. \n2.1.5 Regulation of Postsynaptic Accumulation by CaMKII Autophosphorylation \nUpon Ca2+ influx T286A mutant CaMKIIα translocates like wild-type CaMKIIα to \npostsynaptic sites. However, in contrast to wild-type CaMKII, the T286A mutant \ndisperses within a few seconds rather than minutes following cessation of Ca2+ \ninflux (212, 213). Furthermore, Ca2+ influx also induces postsynaptic accumulation \nof the phosphomimetic T286D mutant, which requires more than 1 h for relocation \nafter termination of Ca2+ influx (213). Accordingly, T286 phosphorylation is not \nsufficient for activity-induced translocation but does stabilize CaMKII at \npostsynaptic sites. The resulting prolonged postsynaptic CaMKII accumulation can \nbe reversed by phosphorylation of T305/306 and dephosphorylation of T286: \nmutating T305 and T306 to alanine or application of the phosphatase inhibitor \ncalyculin A, like the T286D mutation, slow postsynaptic CaMKII dispersal in \ncultured neurons (212) whereas mutating T305 to aspartate reduces the CaMKII \ncontent of PSDs in knock-in mice under basal conditions (73). If PKA is stimulated \nin parallel with Ca2+ influx postsynaptically clustered CaMKII is retained for \nextended time periods (183, 213). PKA phosphorylates inhibitor-1, which then \ninhibits the phosphatase PP1 and thereby dephosphorylation of CaMKII on T286 to \npromote LTP (28). PKA could also be involved in prolonged postsynaptic CaMKII \naccumulation upon extended stimulation with glutamate (20), as the ensuing Ca2+ \ninflux can activate Ca2+-stimulated adenylyl cyclase 1 and 8."}
{"text": "===== Page 11 =====\nPostsynaptic Targeting of Protein Kinases and Phosphatases\n469\n \n \nAs T286 autophosphorylation is not sufficient for postsynaptic CaMKII \naccumulation, initial binding might be triggered by Ca2+/CaM, which can induce \nCaMKII binding to NR2B/C in the absence of ATP in vitro (19, 122). In support of \nan important role for binding of Ca2+/CaM to CaMKII in postsynaptic targeting, \nblocking Ca2+/CaM binding by mutating CaMKII A302 to arginine prevents \nglutamate-induced translocation of CaMKIIα (212). A second potential mechanism \ninvolves displacement of α-actinin from NR1 C0 (Fig. 1c): binding to this site \nrequires both T286 phosphorylation and dislocation of α-actinin by Ca2+/CaM (161). \nAccordingly, CaMKII T286D will not be able to bind to NR1 C0 under basal \nconditions as long as α-actinin is associated with NR1 C0. Such a mechanism would \nalso explain the finding that translocation of CaMKII to postsynaptic sites requires \nspecifically Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors (241). \n2.1.6 Binding-Induced CaMKII Activity \nOnce formed, Ca2+/CaM-triggered CaMKII binding to NR2B/C is stable even after \nCa2+ chelation to remove CaM (19). Notably, a complex between non-\nphosphorylated CaMKII and NR2B possesses autonomous activity similar to T286-\nautophosphorylated CaMKII (19). Binding of CaMKII to the Drosophila eag K+ \nchannel leads to an analogous constitutive activation of CaMKII (232). The amino \nacid sequence of the NR2B/C and the eag binding site are similar to the T286 region. \nWe hypothesize that displacement of T286 from the T site (Section 2.1.2) allows \nstable binding of NR2B/C or eag with this site to prevent re-association of not only \nT286 with the T site but also the pseudosubstrate region with the S site. These \ninteractions would in this way confer autophosphorylation-independent autonomous \nactivity, which in turn could promote T286 phosphorylation of a neighboring \nCa2+/CaM-bound subunit in the CaMKII holoenzyme. Binding to NR2B/C or eag \ncould, thereby, locally spark autonomous activity when a limited amount of \nCa2+/CaM is available. However, S1303 in NR2B/C is a CaMKII phosphorylation \nsite (180) and NR2B/C can also interact with catalytic sites in a not fully understood \ncomplex manner to inhibit CaMKII activity under certain conditions (197). \n2.2 Postsynaptic Targeting of PKA by AKAPs \nPKA is a tetramer that consists of two dimerized regulatory (R) and two catalytic (C) \nsubunits. Four genes encode RIα, RIβ, RIIα, and RIIβ and three genes Cα, Cβ, and \nCγ (33, 65). Cγ is only detectable in testis. Binding to R dimers inhibits catalytic \nactivity of C subunits until their release by cAMP binding to R. RII and to a lesser \nextent RI associate with a number of substrates via A kinase anchor proteins \n(AKAPs) (37, 204, 264). AKAPs are diverse proteins that range from 15 to >300 \nkDa in size but share 14–18 residue long amphipathic α helices that bind the R \ndimer. \n \nFull activation of C subunits requires their release from R subunits by cAMP, \nwhich should displace C from AKAP – RII complexes and thereby reduce \nphosphorylation of the targeted proteins. In fact, prolonged stimulation via cAMP of \nCav1.1 reduces its potentiation by PKA consistent with dislocation of the C subunit"}

However, C subunits can be activated by cAMP without \nfully dissociating from RII subunits (252, 274). Incomplete dissociation might keep \nC subunits anchored near their substrates. RI isoforms, which are anchored to a \nlesser degree than RII, appear to more fully release their C subunit during substrate \nphosphorylation in vitro (252). \n2.2.1 Postsynaptic Localization of AKAP5 and its Function \nRodent AKAP150, human AKAP79, and bovine AKAP75 are orthologs and were \nrecently re-named AKAP5. AKAP150 differs from AKAP75/79 by an insert of 36 \nimperfect octapeptide repeats of unknown function (204). AKAP5 is the main \nAKAP that targets PKA to postsynaptic sites (88, 142, 264). Removal of its PKA \nanchoring site reduces the PKA content of postsynaptic densities by 70–80% (142). \nAKAP5 binds to the SH3 and GK domain of PSD-95 and its homolog SAP97 (48, \n237) (Fig. 3). PSD-95 interacts directly with the NMDA receptor and via stargazin \nor its homologs with AMPA receptors (Chapter by Kennedy et al., this volume). \nSAP97 binds to the C terminus of AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit (123) thereby \nbridging AKAP5 and associated PKA with GluR1 (237, 264) (Fig. 3). Disruption of \nAKAP-mediated PKA anchoring leads to run-down of AMPA receptor-mediated \nexcitatory postsynaptic currents (203). PKA-mediated phosphorylation of S845 on \nGluR1 requires its association with PKA via AKAP5 and SAP97 is a critical linker \n(237). Anchored PKA increases channel activity (12), surface expression, and \npostsynaptic accumulation of GluR1-containing AMPA receptors (74, 150, 175). \nThe role of PSD-95/AKAP5–anchored PKA in NMDA receptor regulation is less \nclear. \n \nAKAP5 also interacts with PKC and the Ca2+/CaM-activated phosphatase \ncalcineurin (PP2B) (45, 115). AKAP5 is critical for reversal of PKA-mediated \nGluR1 upregulation by PP2B (220, 237). Although PKA, PKC, and PP2B regulate \nNMDA receptor activity (134, 140, 195, 219) (Sections 2.2.3 and 2.3.1) it is \nunknown whether these effects depend partially or fully on their anchoring by \nAKAP5. \n \nAKAP5 also binds to F-actin, cadherin, and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-\nbisphosphate (PIP2; Fig. 3), all of which are present if not enriched at postsynaptic \nsites and can thereby contribute to its postsynaptic localization (59, 88, 89). It is thus \ndifficult to precisely define whether a certain interaction is especially critical for \ntargeting AKAP5 in general to postsynaptic sites or specifically to defined PKA \nsubstrates. Furthermore, a 3 min stimulation of Ca2+ influx through the NMDA \nreceptor, which induces LTD, leads to redistribution of postsynaptic AKAP5 to the \ncytoplasm in a PP2B-dependent fashion (88, 102, 220). This Ca2+ influx also reduces \nthe postsynaptic content of F-actin and PSD-95 but not cadherin (49, 88, 89, 220). In \naddition, PKC as well as Ca2+/CaM inhibit AKAP5 binding to F-actin, cadherin, \nPIP2, and PSD-95 (88, 89, 220). Stabilization of F-actin by jasplakinolide inhibits \nAKAP5 relocalization and dissociation from PSD-95 (88, 220). Furthermore, \ninhibition of phospholipase C to prevent PIP2 hydrolysis blocks the Ca2+ influx-\ninduced dispersal of AKAP5, F-actin, and PSD-95 (102). It thus appears that \nmultiple interactions that foster each other are required for proper postsynaptic"}

The function of AKAP5 and PKA relocalization is unclear but \ncould contribute to downregulation of signaling pathways that otherwise lead to \noverstimulation. The observation that dephosphorylation of GluR1 on its PKA site \nS845 precedes persistent AKAP5 relocation during chemically induced LTD is \ncompatible with AKAP5 being important for linking PP2B to GluR1 (220). PKA \nwill be displaced in parallel with AKAP5, thereby preventing GluR1 \nrephosphorylation in this form of LTD. \n2.2.2 The β2Adrenergic Receptor – Adenylyl Cyclase – Gs – AKAP5 – PKA – \nCav1.2 Signaling Complex \nThe L-type Ca2+ channel Cav1.2 regulates neuronal excitability and gene expression \nand triggers cardiac contraction. β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs) stimulate via Gs, \nadenylyl cyclase, and PKA Cav1.2 currents during the fight or flight response (21, \n181, 196) in part by phosphorylation of S1928 in the central Cav1.2 subunit α11.2 \n(93, 179). Cav1.2 is concentrated at postsynaptic sites of glutamatergic and \nGABAergic synapses (55, 97, 173) where it contributes to Ca2+ influx especially \nupon β-AR stimulation (101). L-type channels mediate a portion of LTP induced by \nhigh frequency tetani (92) (Chapter by Lisman and Hell, this volume) and of \nactivity-induced homeostasis of synaptic transmission by suppressing GluR1 \nexpression (242). \n \nAKAP5 and AKAP7 (AKAP15/18) bind directly to Cav1.2 for PKA-mediated \nregulation of Cav1.2 in brain (93, 179) and heart, respectively (108). This spatial \nconfinement of PKA signaling extends in the case of Cav1.2 beyond the kinase: the \nCav1.2 also contains the β2-AR, Gs, and adenylyl cyclase (11, 55). The C-terminus of \nthe β2-AR directly binds to the central, pore-forming α11.2 subunit (55). It is unclear \nhow Gs and adenylyl cyclase are linked to Cav1.2. AKAP5 binds adenylyl cyclase 5 \nand 6 (18) and could thereby recruit one or both isoforms to Cav1.2. During cell-\nattached patch clamp recording, administration of a β2-AR- agonist increases L-type- \ncurrents by more than two fold inside, but not outside, the recording pipette \nelectrode in neurons (55) and cardiomyocytes (42) via PKA (6, 101, 179, 268, 278). \nThese results suggest that cAMP signaling can be restricted to sub-μm dimensions. \n \nMechanisms of cAMP compartmentalization are not fully understood but \ninvolve cAMP hydrolysis by phosphodiesterases (PDEs) (224, 268). Some AKAPs \ninteract with PDEs (23) and different PDE4 isoforms are recruited to activated β2 -\nARs via β arrestin for localized breakdown of cAMP (10, 192). In the heart cGMP-\ninhibited cAMP PDEs (PDE3 family) and the cAMP-specific PDEs (PDE4 family) \ncontribute to the spatial restricted regulation of Cav1.2 by the β2-AR (111, 199). The \nabundant PDE4D3 isoform binds to AKAP6 (mAKAP) (64, 66), the longer splice \nform of AKAP9 (AKAP350) (236) and AKAP12 (gravin, AKAP250) (263). Co-\nlocalization of PDE4D with PKA by AKAPs fosters phosphorylation of PDE4D by \nPKA to stimulate cAMP hydrolysis (51, 66). \n \nLike AKAP5, AKAP12 binds to the β2-AR C-terminus for agonist-induced \ninternalization of the β2-AR and also recovery of the β2-AR from this desensitization \n(76, 132, 216).

It binds to \nthe C1 cassette in the C-terminus of the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors (262). It \nrecruits PKA to upregulate currents through the NMDA receptor (262). A recent \nreport indicates that PKA acts mainly by selectively increasing Ca2+ permeability of \nthe NMDA receptor (219). AKAP9 also links the phosphatase PP1 to the NMDA \nreceptor to counteract the PKA effect (262). Anchoring of PKA and a phosphatase \nby AKAP9 is analogous to AKAP5, which links PKA and PP2B to GluR1 (220, \n237) and Cav1.2 (179). However, PKA-mediated upregulation of Cav1.2 is not only \ncounterbalanced by AKAP5-anchored PP2B but also by PP2A, which requires a \ndirect stable association with Cav1.2 (56, 94) (Section 3.3.2). \n2.3 PSD-95 as a Hub for Targeting PKC, Pyk2, Src, and Fyn \n2.3.1 Regulation of the NMDA Receptor by PKC – Pyk2 – Src \nGq-coupled receptors including the metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR1 and 5 \nactivate phospholipase Cγ for hydrolysis of PIP2 to inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) \nand diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 induces Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. DAG \ncan either alone or in conjunction with Ca2+ stimulate most PKC isoforms. \nConventional PKCα, PKCβ, and PKCγ isoforms are activated when DAG or Ca2+ \nbind to the conserved C1 and C2 domains, respectively (164, 172). Novel isoforms \n(PKCδ, PKCε, PKCη, PKCθ) have no C2 domain and require only DAG but not \nCa2+ for full activation. Atypical isoforms (human PKCι, mouse PKCλ, PKCζ) lack \nC1 and C2 domains and their regulation is not well understood. \n \nPKC increases surface expression, opening probability (119), and peak currents \nof NMDA receptors (141). However, PKC can also decrease steady state currents by \nincreasing inactivation (140). PKC can directly act on the NMDA receptor to reduce \nsteady state currents and through Pyk2 and Src or related kinases (SRKs) to increase \npeak currents (140, 141). Inhibition of Src prevents PKC- and also Pyk2-induced \nincreases in NMDA receptor peak currents and inhibition of Pyk2 abrogates PKC- \nbut not Src-induced increases in NMDA receptor peak currents (106, 140, 141). \nThese results place Pyk2 downstream of PKC and upstream of Src. \n \nPyk2 is a close homolog of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK). It consists of a Band \n4.1 homology domain, a region with Y402 for autophosphorylation, which is part of \nthe activation process, the kinase domain, a region with two proline-rich segments, \nand the Focal Adhesion Targeting (FAT) domain (9, 125, 209, 275). It is present in \ndendrites (159, 211). Pyk2 can indirectly be activated by PKC or by Ca2+ influx. \nPyk2 links Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors and Ca2+ channels and activation of \na number of Gq coupled receptors including mGluR1 and 5 to signaling via tyrosine \nphosphorylation pathways (60, 63, 70, 86, 106, 125, 206). The precise mechanisms \nof Pyk2 activation are unclear. In contrast to FAK, Pyk2 can be activated \nindependently of Src (186, 265) (but see (43, 222))."}
{"text": "===== Page 16 =====\n474 \nS. Strack and J.W. Hell \n \n \nAutophosphorylation of Pyk2 on Y402 allows binding of the SH2 domain of \nSrc to promote Src activation (63, 206). Src then phosphorylates Y579 and Y580 in \nthe activation loop to fully activity Pyk2 (8, 17, 63, 125, 128). Src activation by \nPyk2 upregulates NMDA receptor peak currents likely through phosphorylation of \nNR2 subunits (41, 106, 116, 206, 260). This NMDA receptors regulation is \nimportant for LTP that depends on Ca2+ influx through the NMDA receptor (106, \n143, 206, 269). \n2.3.2 Binding of PKC, Pyk2, Src to PSD-95 and ND2 \nPostsynaptic anchoring mechanisms exist for all three kinases. PKCα has a C-\nterminal type I PDZ domain binding motif (ETAV- COO–; critical moieties in bold). \nThis motif mediates PKCα binding to PICK1 and PSD-95. PICK1 is another \npostsynaptic structural protein that contains a PDZ domain and was first identified as \na PKCα interacting protein (223). It plays a critical role in promoting AMPA \nreceptor trafficking involving PKC, although precise mechanisms are not known \n(e.g., (139, 267)). PSD-95 also interacts with one ore more of its three PDZ domains \nwith PKCα (130). PSD-95 is of special interest in the context of the PKC – Pyk2 – \nSrc pathway because it also binds with its somewhat unusual SH3 domain to Pyk2 \n(211) and with its N-terminal region in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner to the \nSH2 domain of Src (112). Like PSD-95, Src and Pyk2 co-immunoprecipitate with \nthe NMDA receptor (211, 276). PSD-95 might thus link PKCα, Pyk2, and Src to the \nNMDA receptor. A second potential linker is RACK1, initially identified as binding \nprotein for activated PKCβ (200). RACK1 also binds Src (40) and the related Fyn \n(271) and thus can provide a scaffold that links these two tyrosine kinases with \nPKCβ. However, PSD-95 and RACK1 binding suppresses Src and Fyn activity (40, \n112, 271). It is possible that RACK1 functions in anchoring Src and Fyn at \npostsynaptic sites and that certain stimuli relax the inhibitory interaction as occurring \nfor PKA C subunits upon their release from AKAP-anchored R subunits by cAMP \n(see above). The unique domain of Src also binds to the NADH dehydrogenase \nsubunit 2 (85). ND2 is a mitochondrial protein but remarkably is also present outside \nmitochondria at postsynaptic sites and required for regulation of NMDA receptors \nby Src (85). Binding to ND2 does not block Src activity. \n3 Targeting of Phosphatases to Postsynaptic Sites \n3.1 Phosphatase Classification \nThe human genome encodes more than 500 protein kinases but only ~140 protein \nphosphatases (5, 151). This ratio has been interpreted as evidence for greater \npromiscuity of phosphatases compared to kinases. However, PP1 and PP2A exist as \nmultimeric enzymes composed of catalytic and variable regulatory subunits, thereby \nincreasing the complexity of the “phosphatome” considerably. \n \nProtein phosphatases are classified according to catalytic mechanisms as metal-\nbased, Cys-based, or Asp-based phosphatases.

The PPP group includes \nthe catalytic subunits of PP1, PP2A, PP2B (calcineurin), and PP4-7. The PPM (or \nPP2C) family consists of magnesium-dependent protein phosphatases, which have \nsome structural similarity to PPP-class catalytic domains. PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and \nPP2C account for the majority of Ser/Thr phosphatase activity and are abundant \nproteins, particularly in brain. The more recently identified PP4 through PP7 are less \nabundant and may have relatively narrow substrate specificities. \n \nCys-based phosphatases feature a conserved catalytic motif (CX5R) and are \nclassified into four groups (5). Similar to Tyr kinases, the protein Tyr phosphatase \n(PTP) group can be further divided into receptor and non-receptor PTPs. The Asp-\nbased phosphatases are characterized by a catalytic motif containing two aspartates \n(DXDXT). This growing group of Tyr/Ser phosphatases contains the eyes absent \n(Eya) transcription factors and a cofilin phosphatase. \n \nHere we will discuss synaptic functions of the widely studied PPP group of \nSer/Thr phosphatases (PP1, PP2A, PP2B). The reader is referred to excellent \nreviews for more information on tyrosine phosphatases in the brain (32, 188). \n3.2 Protein Phosphatase PP1 \nTogether with PP2A, PP1 contributes about 90% of phospho-Ser/Thr directed \nactivity in most cell types. The PP1 catalytic subunit is a ~36 kD globular protein \nthat is highly conserved from yeast to man. In mammals, there are four PP1 isoforms \n(α, β/δ, γ1, γ2) encoded by three genes (α-γ). PP1γ1 and PP1γ2 arise by differential \nsplicing from the same gene. The C-termini of PP1 isoforms display the most \nsequence variability and may contribute to isoform-specific association with \nregulatory proteins (38). \n \nThe crystal structure of the PP1 catalytic subunit complexed with a regulatory \nprotein, myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1), illustrates how regulatory \nsubunits confer substrate specificity (Fig. 4b–e). The PP1/MYPT1 complex mediates \nsmooth muscle contraction through dephosphorylation of the myosin regulatory \nchain, but has also a critical role in cerebellar LTD by dephosphorylating Ser880 of \nGluR2 (75). MYPT1 extends the substrate binding pocket of PP1 with an acidic \ngroove, which may help attract substrates with clusters of basic residues next to the \nphospho-Ser/Thr (239). \n \nNeuronal roles of the PP1 targeting/regulatory subunits spinophilin, neurabin, \nand DARPP-32 are well established. DARPP-32 knockout mice are largely \nunaffected by several drugs of abuse, underscoring the importance of this protein in \n \nFree PP1 catalytic subunits are not known to exist in significant quantities in \ncells; rather they form complexes with more than 50 binding partners (Fig. 4a). PP1 \nregulatory proteins determine the physiological functions of specific PP1 \nholoenzymes. They can be classified into substrate-independent activity modulators \n(e.g., inhibitor-1, inhibitor-2, dopamine and cAMP-dependent phosphoprotein of 32 \nkDa (DARPP-32)), and targeting subunits/substrate specifiers (e.g., spinophilin, \nneurabin). Binding of many PP1 associated proteins involves an “RVXF” motif that \nslots into a hydrophobic pocket on the catalytic subunit. The actual consensus \nsequence for PP1 binding is [K/R]X0–1[I/V]<P>[F/W], where X can be any residue \nand <P> can be any residue but proline (38)."}

Spinophilin/neurabin has therefore been \nproposed as an adapter complex that links the cortical cytoskeleton to receptors in \nthe plasma membrane. Indeed, spinophilin has been shown to stabilize GPCRs at the \ncell surface (31), and regulates GPCR signaling by competing with arrestin for \nbinding to the 3iL and recruiting RGS proteins to the receptor complex (257–259). \n \nWhereas neurabin is found exclusively in neurons (170), spinophilin is \nexpressed in many mammalian tissues (3, 210). Both are highly enriched in dendritic \nspines and co-fractionate with the PSD (3, 145, 170, 210). Neurabin, but not \nspinophilin, has also been localized to subsets of presynaptic terminals (168, 169). \nWhile both proteins are believed to target PP1 to key synaptic substrates, specific \ninteraction partners and the differential localization of the two proteins may be \nresponsible for the different phenotypes of spinophilin and neurabin knockout mice \n(see below). \n \nA significant fraction, possibly as much as 60% of PP1 in certain brain regions \nexists in complexes with spinophilin and neurabin, because single knockouts \ndecrease PP1 catalytic subunit content in homogenates of the striatum by ~30% (4). \nA similar decrease in PP1 content was observed in the synaptoneurosome fraction of \nhippocampal slice cultures infected with virus expressing a dominant-negative \nneurabin construct (104). Taking into account that presumably only a fraction of \nneurons expressed the dominant-negative construct, these experiments suggest that \nneurabin and spinophilin are largely responsible for targeting PP1 to dendritic \nspines. \n3.2.2 Spinophilin and Neurabin in Cytoskeletal Dynamics and Spine Formation \nThe N-terminal F-actin binding domain is necessary and sufficient for the \nlocalization of spinophilin and neurabin to dendritic spines, and spine targeting of \nneurabin requires an intact actin cytoskeleton (13, 90, 279). Expression of the \nisolated F-actin binding domain of spinophilin/neurabin induces reorganization of \nthe actin cytoskeleton and filopodial outgrowth in cultured neurons (178, 240). The \nneurabin N-terminus increases the density of innervated dendritic spines in cultured \nhippocampal slices (279). It is unclear whether these phenotypes are a non-specific \nconsequence of the actin bundling activity of this domain (170, 210), or whether \nthey result from a dominant-negative displacement of endogenous actin associated \nproteins, because overexpression of full-length spinophilin/neurabin did not have an \neffect.  \n \nFurther evidence suggests that spinophilin and neurabin are important for the \nmorphological differentiation of neurons. Gene knockout of spinophilin causes a \ntransient increase in dendritic spine density in vivo and excessive filopodial \nextensions in vitro (77). While data on spine development in neurabin knockout \nmice are not available, expression of a PP1 binding-deficient neurabin mutant delays \nthe maturation of dendritic filopodia into spines (240). Spinophilin/neurabin may \nalso affect F-actin organization and spine morphology independent of PP1 through \nrecruitment of the Rho GEFs kalirin-7 and Lcf (191, 205). \n \nSpinophilin also regulates the neuronal microtubule cytoskeleton. Doublecortin, \nthe protein product of the disease gene for the human neuronal migration disorder \ndouble cortex and X-linked lissencephaly, is a microtubule-associated protein that \nalso interacts with the coiled-coil region of spinophilin (26, 248).

Neurons from \ndoublecortin or spinophilin knockouts have splayed or unevenly spaced \nmicrotubules, and the double knockout exacerbated this defect and additionally \nprevented axons from crossing the midline to form the corpus callosum (26). \n3.2.3 Spinophilin and Neurabin in Synaptic Transmission and Plasticity \nPP1 is critical for the induction of LTD in the hippocampus and other brain areas. \nLTD-inducing stimuli promote translocation of PP1 into spines, coinciding with the \ndephosphorylation and internalization of AMPA receptors (71, 121, 165). Inhibition \nof PP1 activity or displacing PP1 from its targeting subunits (for instance with an \n“RVXF” motif-containing peptide) blocks LTD (165, 166). \n \nRecent results suggested that neurabin targets PP1 to dendritic spines of CA1 \nhippocampal neurons to regulate surface expression of specific pools of AMPA \nreceptors (104). Neurabin-targeted PP1 tonically stabilizes basal synaptic \ntransmission by dephosphorylating GluR2 at S880, thereby preventing the \ninteraction of GluR2 with PICK1 and the internalization of GluR2-containing \nAMPA receptors. During LTD, neurabin recruits PP1 into the vicinity of GluR1 \ncontaining AMPA-receptors, resulting in the dephosphorylation of GluR1 on S831 \nand S845, which in turn reduces single channel activity and surface expression of \nGluR1-containing AMPA receptors (Section 2). In this study, endogenous PP1-\nneurabin complexes were displaced with a “dominant-negative” mutant that binds to \nactin, but not PP1 (neurabin1–490F460A), which may also displace PP1-spinophilin \ncomplexes from the F-actin cytoskeleton in dendritic spines. Given that spinophilin \nknockout mice are deficient in hippocampal LTD (77), it is possible that spinophilin \nand neurabin have at least partially overlapping functions at hippocampal synapses. \n \nKnockout mice show that spinophilin and neurabin have distinct functions in \ndopamine-mediated plasticity (4). Deletion of neurabin blocks AMPA receptor \npotentiation by the D1 dopamine receptor in prefrontal cortex and striatum, whereas \nspinophilin deletion shows this defect only in the striatum. While neurabin knockout \nmice are deficient in corticostriatal LTP, spinophilin knockout mice lack LTD at this \nsynapse. Supporting a role in AMPA receptor dephosphorylation, both knockout \nstrains displayed enhanced induction of GluR1 S845 phosphorylation by D1-\nreceptor activation. Interestingly, basal GluR1 S845 phosphorylation was reduced in \nboth knockout mice, which is consistent with biochemical studies showing that \nspinophilin and neurabin are potent PP1 inhibitors in vitro (103, 145, 156). A factor \nthat complicates the interpretation of these knockout studies is that both neurabin \nand spinophilin have been implicated in dendritic spine formation (77, 240). \n3.3 PP2A and its Localization in Neurons \nPP2A constitutes between 0.3 and 1% of total protein in mammalian cells. It \nsupplies most of the soluble Ser/Thr phosphatase activity (100, 109). PP2A exists \npredominantly as a holoenzyme formed by three subunits.

In mammals, A and C subunits are each encoded by two highly \nsimilar genes (Aα/β, Cα/β), with Aα and Cα isoforms being more abundant. \nRegulatory subunits are encoded by three multi-gene families, referred to as B, B’, \nproteins with molecular masses of ~55 kDa (96, 155, 184, 226, 280). The B’ family \n(also referred to as B56 or PR61) consists of at least 7 isoforms encoded by five \ngenes (B’α, B’β, B’γ, B’δ, and B’ε) (52, 157, 158, 234, 238, 281), with molecular \nmasses between 54 and 74 kDa. There are at least four members of the B” family, \ndesignated according to their size as PR48 (273), PR59 (253), and PR72/130 (98). \nPR72 and PR130 are splice- or promoter-use variants of the same gene. Several \nPP2A regulatory subunits show restricted tissue expression; in particular, Bβ1, Bβ2, \nand Bγ can only be detected in brain, and B’β and B’δ are enriched in brain (155, \n231, 280). \n \n \nFig. 6.

The brain-enriched PP2A/B’β complex specifically dephosphorylates and \ninactivates tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine \nsynthesis. PP2A/B’β was largely restricted to the somata of dopaminergic neurons in \nthe substantia nigra and could not be detected in dopaminergic terminal fields in the \nstriatum, which correlated with regional differences in tyrosine hydroxylase \nphosphorylation. B’β may curb dopamine synthesis and build-up of toxic \nmetabolites of catecholamine at non-synaptic sites (207). Even though PP2A has \nbeen shown to regulate several pre- and postsynaptic proteins, the identity of the \nregulatory subunits that recruit the phosphatase holoenzyme to synapses remains to \nbe established. \n3.3.1 PP2A in Synaptic Plasticity \nCompared to PP1 and PP2B, relatively little is known about the role of PP2A in \nsynaptic function. The majority of studies implicating PP2A in synaptic transmission \nand plasticity employed pharmacological inhibitors such as okadaic acid or \nfostriecin, rather than inhibitory proteins or genetic tools. Even though okadaic acid \ninhibits PP2A at 10-fold lower concentration than PP1 in vitro, it is often applied at \nnon-selective concentrations to overcome the slow uptake of the drug into cells. \n \nPerhaps the best evidence for an involvement of PP2A derives from studying \nsynaptic plasticity between granule and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, which is \nthought to be critical for motor learning. Contrasting LTP/LTD in the CA1 region of \nthe hippocampus, cerebellar LTD requires kinase activation and phosphatase \ninactivation (146), whereas LTP requires the activity of multiple phosphatases, \nincluding PP2A (24). In dissociated cerebellar cultures, specific inhibition of \npostsynaptic PP2A induces synaptic depression that occludes electrically-evoked \nLTD. Synaptic depression was use-dependent and was associated with declustering \nor internalization of GluR2-containing AMPA receptors(120). Available data point \nto a developmental switch in the phosphatases whose inhibition mediates cerebellar \nLTD, with PP2A playing the major role in mature cerebellar cultures (>22 DIV), and \nPP1 dominating in younger cultures (75, 120). \nPP2A forms complexes with several ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors, \nwhich often contain an opposing kinase, to increase the spatial and temporal fidelity \nand specificity of signaling events in response to discretely localized stimuli. \n \nPhosphorylation of the Ca2+ channel CaV1.2 on S1928 by PKA increases its \nactivity. PP2A containing B’ and B”, but not B-family regulatory subunits interacts \nwith a region downstream of this phosphorylation site to downregulate Cav1.2 phos-\nphorylation and activity (94). The N-type Ca2+ channel (CaV2.2) mediates neuro-\ntransmitter release from nerve terminals. It binds the PP2A scaffolding A subunit, \nalthough the functional consequences of this association were not studied (114). \n \nIntracellular Ca2+ release channels are also intimately associated with the \nphosphatase. The ryanodine receptor RyR2 contains three leucine-isoleucine zipper \n(LIZ) motifs. One mediates PP2A binding, possibly through the B” regulatory \n3.3.2 Complexes of PP2A with Ca2+ Channels and the NMDA Receptor"}

AKAP6-anchored PKA increases open \nprobability of RyR2, which is opposed by PP2A and PP1. RyR1 in skeletal muscle \nlacks the LIZ motif that mediates PP2A binding, and therefore assembles selectively \nwith PP1 and PKA (154). The neuronal isoform of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphatase \nreceptor (IP3R1) exists as a similar supramolecular signaling complex with PP1, \nPP2A, and PKA (62). AKAP9 (yotiao) recruits both PKA and PP1 to the IP3R1, \nwhereas PP2A could assemble into the complex through AKAP450, a longer splice \nvariant of AKAP9/yotiao (249). The relative importance of the two phosphatases in \nintracellular Ca2+ channel regulation remains to be investigated. \n \nRecruitment of PKA and PP1 to the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit via \nAKAP9/yotiao (262) has been described above in Section 3.3. Yeast two-hybrid \nscreening identified the PP2A catalytic subunit as an interaction partner for the C-\nterminus of NR3A subunit (39, 144). Whereas NR1 and NR2 form Ca2+-permeable \nNMDA receptors, receptors containing NR1 and NR3 function as Ca2+-impermeable \nexcitatory glycine receptors during development (185). NR3A associates with PP2A \nin brain lysates and thereby mediates dephosphorylation of NR1 at S897 (39, 144). \n3.3.3 Regulation of CaMKII by PP2A \nAutophosphorylation of CaMKII confers Ca2+-independent activity and is critical for \nLTP (Section 2 and Chapter by Lisman and Hell, this volume). Autophosphorylation \nat T305 or T306 in the CaM binding region will keep CaMKII inactive by \npreventing its activation through Ca2+/CaM binding. There are additional in vivo \nautophosphorylation sites (e.g., T253) with unclear functional relevance (67, 163). \n \nPP1 and PP2A dephosphorylate CaMKII in different subcellular locations (PSD \nvs. cytosolic fractions, respectively) (14, 68, 225). This compartment-specific \ndephosphorylation is maintained when soluble or PSD-associated CaMKII are \nincubated with excess phosphatase in vitro, suggesting that conformational changes \nor local accessibility of CaMKII dictate selectivity for PP1 vs. PP2A (225, 227). \nRecent evidence suggests that T286 in PSD-associated CaMKII is somehow \nprotected from dephosphorylation, and that PSD-bound PP1 dephosphorylates \nCaMKII at other sites (167). The identity of the CaMKII T305/306 phosphatase is \nless well defined, but genetic reduction of PP2A activity increases inhibitory \nautophosphorylation of CaMKII in Drosophila (138). Therefore, available evidence \npoints to PP2A as the principal phosphatase that opposes autophosphorylation of \nCaMKII at both stimulatory (T286) and inhibitory (T305/306) sites. \n \nLTP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus is associated with a decrease in \nPP2A activity, as shown with 32P-labeled CaMKII as an in vitro substrate (79). LTP \nis accompanied by an increase in CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of B’β subunit \nof PP2A (denoted as B’α in that report according to older nomenclature). \nPhosphorylation of B’β inhibited its activity towards T286-autophosphorylated \nCaMKII in vitro, suggesting a negative feedback mechanism in which autonomous \nCaMKII inactivates its modulator for persistent Ca2+/CaM -independent activity \nduring LTP (79). Recently, dimeric PP2A containing the α4 subunit was found to \nassociate with cytosolic CaMKII, and neuron-specific α4 knockout mice displayed \nlearning and memory deficits and increased Ca2+/CaM-dependent CaMKII activity."}
{"text": "===== Page 25 =====\nPostsynaptic Targeting of Protein Kinases and Phosphatases\n483\n \nHowever, Ca2+-independent activity was unchanged in the α4 knockout, leaving it \nunclear as to exactly how the PP2A/α4 dimer regulates the kinase (272). \n \nThe importance of phosphatases in returning CaMKII to its basal, Ca2+/CaM \nresponsive state is illustrated by the molecular etiology of Angelman syndrome, a \ndevelopmental disorder characterized by mental retardation and seizures. Angelman \nsyndrome can be caused by loss of function of the maternal copy of the UBE3A \ngene, which, due to brain region-specific imprinting, is the only copy expressed in \nthe hippocampus and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum (54, 72). UBE3A codes for the \nE3A ubiquitin ligase. The few identified substrates have yet to be tied to the \npathology. Mice with a maternally inherited UBE3A mutation display Angelman \ndisease-like symptoms and show hyperphosphorylation of CaMKII at T286 and \nT305. CaMKII hyperphosphorylation correlated with reduced phosphatase activity \nin the hippocampus, most likely PP2A (261). Connecting dysregulated CaMKII \nphosphorylation to the disease, the neurological symptoms could be rescued by \ncrossing Angelman syndrome mice with mice expressing a mutant CaMKII that \ncannot undergo inhibitory autophosphorylation (T305V/T306A) (251). \n3.4.1 Basic Features and Functions of PP2B \nPP2B is a ubiquitously expressed, Ca2+/CaM activated Ser/Thr phosphatase with \nparticularly high levels in the somatodendritic compartment of neurons (91, 152). \nPP2B is perhaps best known as a central mediator of T lymphocyte activation and \ntarget for the immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and cyclosporine A. The enzyme \nconsists of a 60 kDa catalytic subunit (CaN-A), and a 19 kDa regulatory subunit \n(CaN-B), which has structural similarity to CaM. Three genes code for catalytic \nsubunits, with Aα and Aβ being the predominant forms in brain. The regulatory \nsubunit is encoded by two genes, of which only B1 is detectably expressed in \nneurons. Full activity requires both Ca2+/CaM binding to an autoinhibitory domain \non CaN-A and Ca2+ binding to the EF hands of CaN-B. \n \nPP2B has a much lower threshold for activation by Ca2+/CaM (0.1–1 nM) than \nCaMKs including CaMKII, which might leads to the preferential activation of the \nphosphatase during LTD-inducing low frequency stimulation (165, 166). Ca2+-\ndependent phosphorylation events could predominate at the higher stimulation \nfrequencies that induce LTP in part because accumulation of superoxide anions upon \nCa2+ influx results in inactivation of PP2B through oxidation of metal ions in the \nactive site (27, 171). \n \nBecause of steric constraints of the substrate binding region (105), PP2B has \nnarrower substrate specificity than other Ser/Thr phosphatases. The number of \nPP2B-sensitive phospho-proteins is considerable because PP2B also acts indirectly \nby disinhibiting PP1. As discussed above, this disinhibition is accomplished through \ndephosphorylation of PKA sites on inhibitor-1 and DARPP-32, two cytosolic PP1 \ninhibitory proteins (38). Direct and indirect (PP1-mediated) PP2B actions can be \ndistinguished by pharmacological inhibition of PP1 with tautomycin or calyculin A. \n \nMany PP2B targets and anchoring proteins, including AKAP5 feature a PxIxIT \nmotif (actually Px1–2IxIT) that interacts with the CaN-A subunit (7, 30, 35, 53, 58, \n179). First identified in the transcription factor NFAT, this sequence motif binds to a \n3.4 The Ca2+/CaM-Dependent Phosphatase PP2B/Calcineurin"}

Hell \n \nhydrophobic groove on CaN-A that is structurally related to the region on the PP1 \ncatalytic subunit, where proteins containing the RVXF motif dock (126, 127). \nPP2B is a potent modulator of excitatory neurotransmission and can downregulate \nionotropic glutamate receptors by multiple mechanisms. NMDA receptor activity is \nnegatively constrained by PP2B (129, 215, 245, 246), and this effect may be \nmediated by dephosphorylation of the NR2A subunit, possibly of S900 in its C-\nterminal tail (117, 247). PP2B further decreases surface expression and single-\nchannel activity and of AMPA receptors, mediated through dephosphorylation \n(directly or indirectly via PP1) of S831 and S845 in the GluR1 subunit C-terminus \n(22, 121, 221, 237). Dephosphorylation of components of the endocytotic machinery \nprovides an additional mechanism by which PP2B promotes internalization of \nAMPA receptors (22, 133). \n \nAs discussed above (Section 2.2.1), PP2B is recruited to the AMPA receptor \nGluR1 subunit through AKAP5 via SAP97 and possibly also PSD-95 (48). These \ninteractions are crucial for PP2B to antagonize upregulation of GluR1 currents by \nPKA (220, 237). AKAP5 also targets PP2B to CaV1.2 via a direct interaction of \nAKAP5 with the C-terminus of the pore-forming α1 subunit (179). In this complex, \nPP2B dominantly suppresses PKA-mediated enhancement of L-type currents. \nStrikingly, PP2B recruitment by AKAP5 is required for nuclear translocation of the \ntranscription factor NFATc4/NFAT3 in response to L-type channel activation (179). \n4 Concluding Remarks \nSynapses not only transmit signals between neurons but also process signals and \nstore information. Multiple signal pathways regulate the functions of central \nsynapses in a highly complex manner. Many kinases and phosphatases have to be \nanchored near or at defined substrates for fast, efficient, and specific regulation of \ntheir phosphorylation. A true understanding of the numerous forms of synaptic \nplasticity will require the knowledge of the precise molecular interactions of kinases \nand phosphatases at synaptic sites. As discussed above, specific recruitment of \nCaMKII to postsynaptic sites that experience a period of hightened activity likely \ncontributes to their potentiation. New sophisticated experimental approaches such as \nmodification of kinase and phosphatase anchoring by point mutations in the mouse \ngenes of anchoring proteins or, in a more acute setting, with membrane-penetrable \npeptides will help unravel the spatio-temporal organization of synaptic signaling. \nNumerous neurological and mental diseases are due to synaptic dysregulations (e.g., \nChapters by McNamara et al., Meller and Simon, and Salter, this volume). Defining \nthe exact organization of signaling pathways will pave the way for developing novel \ntherapeutics for the treatment of these diseases. \n3.4.2 Interactions of PP2B with Glutamate Receptors and Ca2+ Channels"}

Other \npatterns of stimulation can produce a long-term weakening of synapses, a process \ntermed long-term depression (LTD) or depotentiation. Synapses thus have a stable \nstrength that can be bi-directionally modified in an activity-dependent manner. \nThere are different forms of LTP at different brain synapses. This article focuses \non LTP found at glutamatergic synapses in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, the \nmost studied form of LTP. A typical experiment starts by measuring the strength of a \ngroup of synapses. This is done by ﬁring a single action potential in some of the \naxons that enter this region. These axons make synapses with pyramidal cells and \ngenerate an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). The collective strength of the \nsynapses is defined by the magnitude of the average EPSP. LTP is then induced by \nstimulating the axons to ﬁre at high frequency (typically 100 Hz for 1 s), a stimulus \nreferred to as a tetanus. Remarkably, this brief tetanus causes a long-lasting potentia-\ntion of the strength of the synapses. The size of the EPSP typically increases by \n50%–100%, but can rise by as much as 800% in some situations. In the brain-slice \npreparation used for most studies, potentiation persists until the slice is no longer \nviable (5–12 h). LTP can also be induced in living animals, where it can persist for at \nleast a year (1). \nThe evidence that such changes in synaptic strength are actually involved in \nmemory has strengthened in recent years. Studies have examined the effect of a \nlearning experience on synapses in the hippocampus. Two groups (67, 225) have \ndemonstrated that learning induces an LTP-like process, which reduces the subse-\nquent ability to experimentally induce LTP at these synapses. This occlusion sug-\ngests that learning-induced and experimentally-induced potentiation affect the same \nJ.W.

Each such module contains vesicle release site on the presynaptic \nside. In AMPA receptor silent modules (see upper left of figure), transmission fails both be-\ncause of slow release of glutamate (red dots) and because of the absence of AMPA receptors \nin the module (green and blue marked cylinders). AMPA receptors are missing because their \nanchoring slot proteins (green and blue boxes with corresponding notches) are not bound to \neach other to form a ‘hyperslot’ (lower left) that would be anchored by synaptic core proteins. \nUnder basal conditions (upper left synaptic region) silent modules are interspersed with func-\ntional modules. These can be identified by fast release of glutamate from vesicles (no neck and \ncloud of glutamate released) and the presence of postsynaptic AMPA receptors held in register \nby the hyperslot. AMPA receptors in the slot are in equilibrium with free AMPA receptors \nfound in extrasynaptic membrane. Note that NMDA receptors (purple cylinder) are sparsely \nlocated on the periphery (purple slot protein) of the synapse. The small amount of glutamate \nthat diffuses out of functional AMPA receptor modules is sufficient to activate these NMDA \nreceptors. During early LTP (upper right synaptic region) transmission is enhanced by three \nmechanisms (inward green arrows): slow release of glutamate from a vesicle is converted to \nfast release, increasing glutamate concentration in the cleft at that module; complexes of \nAMPA receptors and hyperslots form at previously silent modules causing a step increase in \nconductance; and more AMPA receptors are inserted into the extrasynaptic membrane driving \noccupancy of hyperslot sites to higher levels.

Hell \n \n7 LTP Maintenance: the Molecular Basis of Synaptic Memory \n7.1 The Role of CaMKII in the Maintenance of LTP \nMemory processes must involve molecules that change their state during LTP induc-\ntion. This change must be persistent and have the power to affect the expression \nprocesses that underlie LTP. Such persistent processes constitute the maintenance \nprocesses. The most critical aspect of the maintenance process is stability: the stor-\nage must be stable for years. Thus, whatever molecular mechanisms underlie main-\ntenance can be described as a switch with stable on and off states. Whatever mole-\ncules are involved in maintenance must undergo turnover, which generally occurs \nwithin hours or days. Thus, special mechanisms must exist that allow the state of the \nswitch to be stable despite the turnover of its constituent molecules. The study of \nmaintenance poses special difficulties, but one particular test is useful in distinguish-\ning maintenance from induction processes. In this test, saturating LTP is induced and \nthen a drug is transiently applied. If the drug produces a reversible effect on LTP, \nthen an expression processes has been affected. If the drug produces an irreversible \neffect and if additional LTP can then be induced, then the drug has, affected a main-\ntenance process. \nCaMKII is a major candidate as a memory molecule because it has switch-like \nproperties that make its activity persist after calcium elevation returns to baseline \n(145). This ‘memory’ occurs because Thr286 becomes autophosphorylated during \ncalcium elevation (146, 196) and can persist for many hours after LTP induction \n(56). What potentially limits long-term information storage by such a process is \nspontaneous phosphatase activity, which could dephosphorylate Thr286. Further-\nmore, all proteins undergo protein turnover, so information stored by any one mole-\ncule would be slowly eliminated by this process. Theoretical work, however, points \nto the possibility that Thr286-phosphorylated ‘on’ CaMKII holoenzymes (there are \n12 homologous subunits in a holoenzyme) could retain the on-state for many years \n(144). Dephosphorylation of Thr286 sites could be counteracted by rapid re-\nphosphorylation of these sites by neighboring subunits. Cooperative interactions \nbetween holoenzymes could also lead to phosphorylation of holoenyzmes newly \ninserted in the process of protein turnover. In this way, information could be stably \nstored by groups of CaMKII holoenzymes (116). \nAlthough there are indications that CaMKII is responsible for the maintenance of \nLTP, the evidence is not yet conclusive. The strongest experiments (191) involved \nthe saturation of LTP and the subsequent bath-application of a membrane-permeant \nCaMKII inhibitor. This application reduced transmission; importantly a component \nof this reduction persisted after the inhibitor was removed. At this point, it was pos-\nsible to induce additional LTP, indicating that the inhibitor had reversed a process \ncritical in the maintenance of LTP. \nGiven the importance of CaMKII in LTP and its abundance in the PSD, it be-\ncomes critical to understand what happens to the enzyme within the PSD. CaMKII \nbinds to a number of PSD proteins including the NMDA receptor, densin-180, and \nα-actinin (32, 142) (see Chapter by Strack and Hell). Binding to the NMDA receptor \nNR1 and NR2B subunits requires CaMKII activation by either Ca2+/calmodulin"}
{"text": "===== Page 17 =====\nLong-Term Potentiation\n517\n \n \n \nOnce induced, binding of CaMKII to NR2B is stable even if calmodulin is re-\nmoved by chelating Ca2+. It can also persist if T286 autophosphorylation has not \noccurred (14). The complex between non-phosphorylated CaMKII and NR2B exhib-\nits autonomous activity similar to T286-autophosphorylated CaMKII (14). Analo-\ngous constitutive CaMKII activation is observed when CaMKII is associated with \nthe Drosophila eag K+ channel (209). The CaMKII binding sites on NR2B and eag \npossess significant similarity with the Thr286 region. This region of CaMKII binds \nto the so-called T-site to foster intramolecular inhibition of CaMKII catalytic activity \nby placing the autohinhibitory pseudosubstrate region near the catalytic site (Chapter \nby Strack and Hell). When Thr286 is displaced from the T site by Ca2+/calmodulin, \nwhich binds immediately downstream of Thr286, NR2B or eag associate with the T \nsite. The pseudosubstrate region then cannot re-associate with the catalytic site, \nmuch as occurs when Thr286 CaMKII is phosphorylated. This autophosphorylation-\nindependent autonomous activity may support continued CaMKII activity, in part by \nfostering Thr286 phosphorylation of neighboring subunits in the CaMKII holoen-\nzyme (for this event the substrate subunit must bind Ca2+/calmodulin, but such bind-\ning can occur at a low rate even at resting Ca2+ levels). Thus, NR2B binding can \nlocally support autonomous CaMKII activity when Ca2+/calmodulin is limited. Such \nactivation of CaMKII would explain the lasting autonomous activity and apparent \ninaccessibility for phosphatases that CaMKII exhibits upon LTP induction (57). The \nmaintenance of CaMKII phosphorylation in the PSD appears to be further supported \nby reactions that keep the phosphatase away from the Thr286 site (152, 206). \n7.2 The Role of PKMζ in Maintenance of LTP \nEvidence is accumulating that another kinase, the PKMζ isoform of PKC, has an \nimportant role in LTP maintenance. The concentration of this enzyme is increased \nduring LTP and decreased during LTD (79). The increase of PKMζ after LTP induc-\ntion is due to protein synthesis (76). The gene produces a protein that lacks a regula-\n \n(NR2B) or Thr286 autophosphorylation (NR1, NR2B). Stimulation of postsynaptic \nCa2+ influx through NMDA receptors augments binding of endogenous CaMKII to \nthe NMDA receptor in acute hippocampal slices (106) and postsynaptic clustering of \nGFP-tagged CaMKII in primary hippocampal cultures (200). LTP produces a persis-\ntent translocation of CaMKII from the cytoplasm to the synapse (170). Such translo-\ncation is driven specifically by Ca2+calmodulin influx through the NMDA receptor \n(214). One surprising aspect of the translocation process is that the Thr286Asp muta-\ntion, which mimics Thr286 phosphorylation and stimulates binding to NR1 and \nNR2B, does not automatically induce translocation, but requires synaptic activity. \nOne possible explanation is that although capable of binding to the NMDA receptor, \nit cannot bind to NR1 until α-actinin is removed from NR1 by the Ca2+/calmodulin \nelevation produced by synaptic activity (α-actinin and CaMKII compete for binding \nto the C0 region in the C-terminus of NR1) (143). Important evidence for the func-\ntional relevance of the association of CaMKII with the NMDA receptor comes from \nstudies in hippocampal slice cultures: overexpression of NR2B with mutations in the \nCaMKII binding site that abrogate the CaMKII interaction produces an strong inhibi-\ntion of LTP (9)."}

Rather late phase LTP will not develop or will be reversed if \ninhibitor is applied after LTP is already established (111). Basal synaptic transmis-\nsion is not affected. Importantly, a membrane- penetrable peptide inhibitor of PKMζ, \nZIP, not only reverses LTP when applied in the slice preparation, but can irreversibly \ndestroy a memory (place avoidance), when applied in vivo after learning (175, 199). \nRecent work shows that CaMKII activity is necessary for the synthesis of PKMζ \n(94). It is thus possible that CaMKII and PKMζ are both involved in the maintenance \nprocess. \n7.3 Late Phase LTP \nThe early phase of LTP develops within seconds (101) and does not require protein \nsynthesis. However, late-phase LTP is inhibited by protein synthesis inhibitors. In \nsome reports, the effects of a protein synthesis inhibitor take hours to develop (51), \nbut others report strong effects within 30 min (204). The induction of LTP triggers \nan increase in protein synthesis. For instance, it is known that some forms of mRNA \nare translated locally in the dendrites and that local regulators of translation can \nthemselves be controlled by NMDA receptor activation. These effects on protein \nsynthesis can occur within minutes after LTP induction (218). \nThe utilization of these proteins is affected by a process called synaptic tagging \n(53). After inducing LTP in one pathway, subsequent application of a protein synthe-\nsis inhibitor does not prevent LTP induced in a second pathway recorded from the \nsame neuron. LTP in this second pathway had a normal late phase, despite the pres-\nence of protein synthesis inhibitor, presumably because it was able to use the pro-\nteins whose synthesis that was triggered by the first pathway. This ability of one \npathway to enhance another has a limited lifetime; if the pathways were stimulated \nmore than a few hours apart, there was no interaction. To explain these results, it was \nproposed that LTP induction produces a transient synapse-specific biochemical \nmodification that functions as a tag to incorporate proteins whose synthesis is trig-\ngered by a process that is not synapse-specific. \nLTP induction causes changes in the transcription of many genes and triggers \nnew protein synthesis. The early, transient burst of protein synthesis in the post-\nsynaptic dendrite utilizes pre-existing mRNA transcribed earlier from what are \nknown as intermediate-early genes (IEGs) (33). These genes encode proteins such as \nthe transcription factors zif/268 (33), growth factors such as BDNF (26, 42, 176), \nand enzymes such as CaMKII (124). Another immediate early gene product, \nArc/Arg3.1 interacts with dynamin and endophilin to regulate AMPA receptor endo-\ncytosis (221). Experiments in which inhibitors of transcription were found to block \nlate LTP and the findings that some IEGs are transcription factors have suggested a \nrole for the nucleus in supplying something needed for late LTP. In support of this \nhypothesis, in mutant mice lacking the transcription factor CREB, LTP is nearly \nnormal soon after induction but is reduced at late times (21). \nIt was originally thought that transient elevation of cAMP could directly activate \nthe late phase of LTP, perhaps by stimulating CREB, which is responsive to cAMP. \nHowever, it now appears that this process is not a purely biochemical process, but"}
{"text": "===== Page 19 =====\nLong-Term Potentiation\n519\n \n \n \nrather depends on presynaptic electrical activity induced by cAMP (which can lead \nto closure of K+ channels). In fact, the potentiation induced by elevating cAMP re-\nquires NMDA receptor activity (147, 169). \nWhile cAMP may not be sufficient for late LTP, it is probably necessary. This \nscenario may explain why dopamine modulation is necessary for late LTP. D1 recep-\ntors activate adenylate cyclase and thereby elevate cAMP levels. Experiments with \ndopamine antagonists (52) or knockout of D1 receptors (135) indicate that late LTP \nis blocked under these conditions. These findings raise the question of what causes \nthe firing of the dopamine cells in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that provides \ndopamine to the hippocampus. It now seems likely that the hippocampus itself com-\nputes the novelty of incoming information and that the resulting novelty signal \nstimulates the VTA. In this way, the transition to long-term information storage (late \nLTP) may be conditional upon the novelty of the incoming information (114). \nBDNF has a major role in late LTP (23) and a single nucleotide polymorphism \nthat impairs BDNF secretion correlates with poor episodic memory (44). The peptide \nis secreted from the presynaptic cell during LTP induction (234), primarily as \nproBDNF (149), and is converted to BDNF through the action of plasmin, a protease \nthat itself undergoes activity-dependent secretion and activation by tpA (173) and \npossibly MMP-9 (154). BDNF acts on presynaptic TrkB receptors to enhance the \nsynaptic vesicle release process during high frequency stimulation (49, 219, 220). \nBDNF also appears to be released in response to activity from the postsynaptic cell \n(72, 99). The relative contributions of pre- and post-synaptic release have not been \ndetermined. \nThe early phase of LTP that occurs during the first 30 min does not appear to re-\nquire BDNF action, but later phases do (92, 229). Notably, interfering with TrkB \nfunction at 30 min after LTP induction produces a rapid decrease in potentiation, \nsuggesting that BDNF action is required for a considerable time after induction to \nmaintain LTP. Surprisingly, the synthesis of BDNF may be the only protein synthe-\nsis that is required for late LTP as demonstrated by the ability of BDNF to restore \nlate LTP in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor. This finding takes on special \nimportance given the recent evidence on the role of test pulses in the transition from \nearly LTP to late LTP. Specifically, if test pulses are stopped after induction and then \nresumed about an hour later, the system is sensitive to protein synthesis inhibitor \napplied at this late time (50). \nThese findings can be understood in terms of the model shown in Fig.2. LTP induc-\ntion creates a potentiated state that is stable in the absence of stimulation, but labile in \nthe presence of even low frequency test pulses. Normally, a product of protein synthe-\nsis, likely BDNF, helps to convert the labile state into a stable state through an activity-\ndependent process. If, however, a protein synthesis inhibitor is applied, a second com-\npeting reaction becomes the most likely, the phosphatase-dependent de-potentiation of \nthe labile state (232). Thus any of the following actions will interfere with the devel-\nopment of the stable state: 1) Raising the frequency of test pulses because this activity \nattacks the labile state by a phosphatase-dependent process. 2) Factors that prevent \nBDNF-dependent processes including: protein synthesis inhibition (91); failure to \nprocess proBDNF to BDNF (173); lack of the BDNF receptor, TrkB (229); and inter-\nference with the phospholipase C pathway gated by TrkB (59, 90)."}
{"text": "===== Page 20 =====\n520 \nJ.E. Lisman and J.W. Hell \n \n \nFig. 2. Model for the BDNF-driven conversion of labile early LTP to stable late LTP. Induc-\ntion of synaptic potentiation induces early LTP by increasing the amplitude of AMPA recep-\ntor-mediated responses. Activity-dependent release of BDNF has no direct effect on this step, \nbut does induce TrkB-phospholipase-C activity, which strongly favors the activity (test pulse)-\ndependent transition to late LTP. In the absence of coordinated BDNF release, neuronal activ-\nity (test pulses) drives depotentiation, the first step down a distinct pathway to return to the \nbasal state. \n8 Modulatory Effects on LTP: Metaplasticity \nScores of substances affect the induction of LTP, giving the impression that synaptic \nmodification may be an extremely complex process. However, many of these may \nnot interfere with the biochemistry of synaptic modification itself, but rather act \nindirectly to affect postsynaptic depolarization. As such action will influence NMDA \nreceptor currents, LTP will be secondarily affected. For instance, the inhibition that \nis also evoked by the stimulating electrode may be so strong that LTP cannot be \ninduced. Thus, blocking inhibition can enhance LTP induction (226). GABA antago-\nnists ease the induction of LTP by blocking the rapid GABA-A receptor iontropic \ncurrent, which would otherwise reduce the depolarization that is necessary to relieve \nMg2+ block of the NMDA receptor (41, 77). Activation of the slower metabotropic \nGABA-B receptors sustains the hyperpolarizing IPSP. On the other hand, there are \nsome GABA-dependent processes that can lead to an enhancement of LTP induction. \nGABA can bind to presynaptic GABA-B autoreceptors on interneurons (39). Slow \nactivation of these receptors inhibits GABA release, thereby facilitating the induction \nof LTP by subsequent glutamategic input. This ‘priming’ effect peaks at approxi-\nmately 200 ms with the consequence that theta patterns of stimuli optimally produce \nLTP (37, 38). \nOther work shows that activation of MAP-kinase through the insulin receptor can \nenhance the BK K+ conductance in hippocampal neurons thereby reducing excitabil-"}
{"text": "===== Page 21 =====\nLong-Term Potentiation\n521\n \n \n \nity (163). The resulting interference with synaptically induced depolarization may \naccount for the reduction of LTP by insulin. Also of clear importance in LTP are \ntyrosine kinases, particular Src. Results indicate that a major role of Src and its up-\nstream regulator, the tyrosine kinase Pyk2, is in the activity-dependent upregulation \nof the NMDA receptor itself (81, 121). \n9 Prospects \nThere are many developing areas of research that will yield new insight into the \nmechanisms of LTP and memory. In the past, physiological studies have dealt almost \nexclusively with the study of populations of synapses, but techniques are now being \ndeveloped to study individual synapses. Combined with imaging methods, it should \nbe possible to watch synapses as they undergo LTP and to obtain insight into struc-\nture–function issues. \nRapid progress is also being made in understanding the molecular composition of \nthe synapse. Once a molecule is identified, it is possible to screen for other mole-\ncules that bind to that molecule. A picture is emerging of the molecular complexes \non both sides of the synapse. However, this effort is hindered by lack of direct struc-\ntural information about the PSD. Refinements of EM methods using tomography \noffers hope in this regard. \nUltimately, the testing of hypotheses regarding the molecular basis of memory \nrequires the ability to assay memory itself. There is increased understanding that \nthere are many forms of memory and that they may be mediated by different mecha-\nnisms. New behavioral tests are being developed that allow particular forms of \nmemory to be assessed. The ability of genetic methods to produce defined molecular \nchanges at precise times and precise locations in living animals will make it possible \nto test whether particular forms of memory rely on particular molecules. \nWe are who we are largely because of our accumulated experience stored in \nmemory. As more is learned about LTP, it will become possible to manipulate mem-\nory. It would clearly be undesirable to wipe our memory clear. But as we come to \nunderstand the biochemical basis of memory, it may become possible to affect spe-\ncific memories. This may help in the treatment of unwanted memories, such as those \ninvolved in posttraumatic stress disorders. On the other hand, an understanding of \nmemory and the process of forgetting is likely to yield drugs that will help in the \ntreatment of memory disorders. The implications for understanding the molecular \nbasis of memory are vast and probably largely unanticipated. \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thank Roger Nicoll for his comments on the manuscript.

Homeostatic synaptic plasticity mechanisms provide a means for neurons and cir-\ncuits to maintain stable function in the face of perturbations such as developmental or activity-\ndependent changes in synapse number or strength. These forms of plasticity use negative \nfeedback signaling to adjust synaptic properties to keep activity close to some internal set \npoint value. Recent work suggests that there are likely multiple forms of synaptic homeostasis, \nmediated by distinct signaling pathways and with distinct expression mechanisms. Both exci-\ntatory and inhibitory synapses are subject to homeostatic regulation, and the form of plasticity \npresent at a particular synapse likely depends on its function within a neuronal circuit. \n1 Introduction \n“Somehow the unstable stuff of which we are composed has learned the trick of \nmaintaining stability.” \n- Walter Cannon, The Wisdom of the Body, 1932 \n \nNervous systems are faced with a fundamental problem: how to allow plastic \nmechanisms to shape their output and function, without compromising the stability \nand integrity of the underlying circuits that drive behavior. Many of the plastic \nchanges that underlie developmental and learning-related adaptations are thought to \nrequire synapse-specific changes in synaptic strengths, yet these processes exert a \npowerful destabilizing influence on network function (1, 56). “Hebbian” (after Don-\nald Hebb) forms of synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and \nlong-term depression (LTD), strengthen synaptic inputs that are effective at depolar-\nizing the postsynaptic neuron, and weaken inputs whose firing is not correlated with \nthe postsynaptic neuron. Such correlation-based mechanisms are problematic: by \nanalogy to unconstrained capitalism, the rich continually get richer, and the poor get \npoorer. For example, in the synaptic arena this happens because strong synapses that \nare effective at depolarizing the postsynaptic neuron will continue to be strength-\nened, and will thus become better able to depolarize the postsynaptic neuron, initiat-\ning an unconstrained positive feedback cycle. \nJ.W.

Activity-dependent alternative splicing of NMDAR controls export \nof receptors from the endoplasmic reticulum, and can exert one level of control over \nthe surface expression of NMDA receptor (57). A second level of control has been \ndemonstrated in spinal neurons (which normally have very low levels of synaptic \nNMDAR), where synaptic activity has been shown to inhibit the surface redistribu-\ntion of NMDAR into synaptic sites (72). Whether this mechanism also operates at \ncortical and hippocampal synapses is not known. The slower NMDA potentiation \nduring LTP at neocortical synapses depends upon AMPA potentiation and can be \nblocked by manipulations that prevent insertion of AMPAR, suggesting that accumu-\nlating more AMPA receptors at synaptic sites eventually leads to the accumulation of \nmore NMDA receptors (93), possibly through protein-protein interactions within the \npostsynaptic density. \n \n \nFig. 2.

On the other hand, increasing or decreasing NMDA current may \nstrongly affect NMDAR-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity. Given that high \nlevels of calcium influx through NMDAR tend to induce LTP, while lower levels \ntend to induce LTD, the likelihood of inducing potentiation or depression by any \ngiven pattern of pre and postsynaptic co-activation will be altered by scaling NMDA \ncurrents up or down. If neurons are inactive and scale up synaptic strengths, this \nshould promote LTP and the expense of LTD, and vice-versa. Scaling of NMDA \ncurrents may thus generate the kind of “sliding plasticity threshold” that has been \npostulated to operate in sensory cortex, and can contribute to the generation of stabil-\nity within plastic neuronal networks (4). \n8 Homeostatic Plasticity of Inhibitory Synapses  \nHomeostatic plasticity at excitatory synapses is probably not sufficient to maintain \nnetwork stability in many central networks. For example, cortical networks have \nextensive positive feedback connections between excitatory pyramidal neurons both \nwithin and between cortical layers, which are kept in check by feedback and feed-\nforward inhibition mediated by several types of inhibitory interneurons. Small \nchanges in the balance between excitation and inhibition in such networks can dis-\nrupt cortical function (10, 38, 60) and can affect the induction of Hebbian forms of \nexperience-dependent plasticity (27, 29, 34, 35). This suggests that excitation and \ninhibition must be delicately balanced to keep CNS networks functional, In more \nmature networks, recent work has established that several kinds of plasticity at syn-\napses onto and from GABAergic interneurons are present in the CNS, and like plas-\nticity at excitatory synapses can provide both stabilizing and destabilizing influences \non network function (21, 39, 40, 44, 61). \nReduced visual experience has long been known to induce compensatory changes \nin inhibition within primary visual cortex (26). A similar phenomenon has been \nfound in dissociated cortical and hippocampal networks, where activity-blockade \nreversibly decreases GABA immunoreactivity (52, 53, 73), and reduces the amount \nof functional inhibition received by pyramidal neurons (73). Like homeostatic plas-\nticity at excitatory synapses inhibition is modified through changes in quantal ampli-\ntude and receptor clustering. However, a major locus of expression is also a dramatic \nreduction in the number of functional inhibitory synapses (33), at a time in vitro \nwhen there are no changes in excitatory synapse number (97); conversely, inhibitory \nsynapse number does not change in older cultures (25) (at a time when excitatory \nsynapse number does (97)). Excitatory and inhibition synapses onto cultured cortical \npyramidal neurons are therefore regulated in opposite directions, and utilize a differ-\nent subset of expression mechanisms. Changes in inhibition are an important compo-\nnent of firing rate homeostasis within these cultured networks (45, 74), and these \nstudies strongly suggest that the balance between excitation and inhibition is not a \nfixed quantity, but can be continually adjusted by ongoing activity.  \n \nGABAergic interneurons are very diverse in morphology and connectivity, and \nplay distinct roles within cortical and hippocampal microcircuits. This raises the"}
{"text": "===== Page 12 =====\n546 \nG. Turrigiano \n \nimportant question of whether all inhibitory synapse types are regulated the same by \nhomeostatic mechanisms, or whether functionally distinct classes of interneuron \nrespond differently to long-lasting changes in activity. This question has recently \nbeen addressed within the cortical microcircuitry of layer 4, where visual deprivation \nduring early postnatal development was found to induce compensatory changes in \nnetwork excitability through reciprocal changes in total excitation and inhibition \n(45). These effects look very similar to those seen in dissociated cortical networks \n(74). In slices from deprived and control cortex it was possible to independently \nevaluate changes at two distinct types of inhibitory synapse onto layer 4 star pyrami-\ndal neurons, fast-spiking (FS) basket cells and regular-spiking non-pyramidal \n(RSNP) neurons. FS synapses onto star pyramidal neurons behaved as expected from \nchanges in total inhibition (i.e., reduced visual drive reduced the strength of these \nconnections). However, RSNP synapses actually underwent an increase in synaptic \nstrength following visual deprivation. This was accompanied by a reduction in con-\nnection probability between RSNP and star pyramidal neurons, so that the net effect \nat this synapse is that a given star pyramid is contacted by only half as many RSNP \nneurons, but each unitary connection is twice as strong (45). While the functional \neffects of this synaptic remodeling are not clear, this study illustrates the point that \nthe rules for homeostatic plasticity within real microcircuits are likely to be quite \ncomplicated.  \n \nStudies on both in vivo and in vitro cortical networks show that homeostatic \nsynaptic plasticity rules function to independently adjust excitatory and inhibitory \nfeedback loops, in a manner predicted to preserve the level of network activity in the \nface of changes in drive to the network (45, 74). When activity falls too low (be-\ncause, for example, sensory drive is reduced), excitation between pyramidal neurons \nis boosted, and feedback inhibition is reduced, which should cooperate to raise the \nfiring rates of pyramidal neurons. Conversely, when activity is too high, excitation \nbetween pyramids is reduced (85), while inhibition is increased (Hurvitz and Tur-\nrigiano, unpublished observations), so that the activity of pyramidal neurons is re-\nduced (74, 85). Homeostatic regulation of network activity in recurrent cortical cir-\ncuits thus appears to be “pyramidal neuron-centric”, operating through a coordinated \nset of changes that selectively adjust synaptic strengths to drive pyramidal neuron \nactivity toward some set point range.  \n \nOne important signaling pathway in the homeostatic regulation of inhibitory \nsynapses is through the activity-dependent release of BDNF (25, 73, 74, 79). Since \nBDNF is produced and released by pyramidal neurons, this suggests that inhibitory \nsynapses onto pyramidal neurons should be regulated as a function of pyramidal \nneuron, rather than interneuron, activity. Interestingly, although hyperpolarization of \nindividual pyramidal neurons is capable of inducing some forms of excitatory synap-\ntic homeostasis (8), hyperpolarization of neither individual pyramidal neurons nor \nindividual interneurons was capable of inducing homeostatic changes in inhibition. \nOnly global changes in network activity accomplished this, suggesting that network \nactivity is monitored through extracellular BDNF levels, which then act to homeo-\nstatically adjust inhibitory synapses.  \n \nBDNF plays an important role in the maturation of inhibitory circuits in vivo and \nin vitro. In cortical cultures a chronic increase in BDNF levels has been shown to"}
{"text": "===== Page 13 =====\nHomeostatic Synaptic Plasticity\n547\n \n \n \npotentiate excitatory synapses onto inhibitory interneurons, as well as inhibitory \nsynapses onto pyramidal neurons. These two effects act synergistically to strengthen \nfeedback inhibition onto pyramidal neurons, and thus cooperate to shift the balance \nbetween excitation and inhibition within these cultured networks toward inhibition. \nThis suggests that when pyramidal neuron activity rises too high the resulting in-\ncreased release of BDNF recruits additional inhibition, which then dampens pyrami-\ndal neuron activity again. Somewhat at odds with this idea that BDNF acts as a net-\nwork-wide homeostatic regulator of circuit activity is the demonstration that BDNF \ncan acutely potentiate excitatory synapses onto hippocampal and cortical neurons \nunder some conditions (see section on excitatory synaptic scaling above). BDNF \nplays many roles in synaptic function, and so understanding its specific role in ho-\nmeostatic plasticity will require a better understanding of the different effects of \nacute and chronic changes in BDNF signaling, as well as local versus global release \nand action of this neurotrophin. The role of other signaling pathways in inhibitory \nhomeostatic plasticity has not as yet been investigated.  \n9 Homeostatic synaptic plasticity in vivo \nMajor challenges for the field now include understanding when and why different \nforms of homeostatic plasticity are present in real neuronal networks, and how these \nhomeostatic mechanisms interact with Hebbian forms of plasticity to generate flexi-\nble yet stable microcircuits. When one measures a change in synaptic properties, it is \nvery difficult to determine which plasticity mechanism gave rise to that change. \nProgress in assigning cellular mechanisms to experience-dependent changes in cir-\ncuit properties will require that we know the full range of plasticity mechanisms \npresent within a given microcircuit, as well as possess a much deeper mechanistic \nunderstanding of how each change is produced. Only when we can selectively inter-\nfere with particular forms of Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity during experience-\nMicrocircuits in intact brains are generally quite complex. Most are composed of \nmany different neuron types, and have extensive feedback and feedforward connec-\ntions that can be excitatory, inhibitory, or modulatory. It is now clear, from a number \nof studies. that homeostatic plasticity is present in the central nervous system in vivo, \nand plays important roles in shaping connectivity during development and in re-\nsponse to experience (17, 22, 23, 37, 45, 76). How homeostatic plasticity rules work \nwithin such complex networks is far from understood, but several points are becom-\ning clear. First, like many other forms of plasticity, homeostatic synaptic plasticity is \nstrongly developmentally regulated, and can be turned on and off in different cell \ntypes at different times in development (17, 22, 44). Second, different synapse \n“types” respond differently to the same activity-manipulation, indicating that homeo-\nstatic plasticity rules for a given synapse type depend on the identity of both the \npresynaptic and the postsynaptic neuron (45). For example, excitatory synapse onto \ninterneurons are regulated differently than excitatory synapses onto pyramidal neu-\nrons within neocortical layer 4 of rodent visual cortex; additionally, different classes \nof inhibitory synapse respond differently to visual deprivation (44)."}

Ehlers \n \nHoward Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Neurobiology, Duke University Medical\nCenter, Durham, NC 27710, USA, helton@neuro.duke.edu, ehlers@neuro.duke.edu  \n \n1 Introduction \nThe remodeling of synapses is a fundamental mechanism for information storage and \nprocessing in the brain. During brain development, and in response to learning-\nrelated activity, synapses undergo remarkable structural changes, including growth, \nshrinkage, and elimination. Such structural plasticity provides a physical basis for \nenduring changes in neural circuits that are mediated by alterations in the molecular \ncomposition of the synapse. Indeed, stabilization or removal of neurotransmitter \nreceptors, scaffold proteins, and signaling molecules from the synapse has been \nproposed to account for long-term changes in synaptic strength. Patterns of molecu-\nlar changes in large sets of synaptic proteins, which ultimately encode the history of \nactivity at the synapse, represent a level of complexity that we are only now begin-\nning to understand. \nLong-lasting changes in the molecular content of synapses arise by two general \nmechanisms: the incorporation of new proteins and the selective removal of existing \nsynaptic proteins. For much of the past two decades, the prevailing model for endur-\ning changes in synapse function and structure has been stimulus-dependent gene \nexpression and protein synthesis. Indeed, substantial evidence indicates that tran-\nscriptional events are critical for long-term activity-dependent plasticity (135, 184). \nIn addition, local translation of mRNAs is thought to orchestrate long-lasting forms \nof learning-related synaptic plasticity (269). On the other hand, considerably less \nattention has been given to the contribution of protein turnover to long-term struc-\ntural and functional changes at synapses. \nWhat controls the turnover and replacement of synaptic proteins? For most cel-\nlular proteins, the major pathway of degradation occurs by ubiquitin conjugation and \nsubsequent targeting of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins to the proteasome. Here we \nwill discuss the role of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) in the structural and \nJ.W.

{"text": "===== Page 3 =====\nUbiquitin and Protein Degradation in Synapse Function\n555\n \nFig. 1. Overview of the UPS.  \nUbiquitin (Ub) monomers are activated in an ATP-dependent reaction by the Ub-activating \nenzyme (E1) and subsequently transferred to a Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2). Ub ligases (E3) \nfacilitate the transfer of Ub to normal or abnormal target proteins. The covalent transfer of Ub \nmonomers to lysine (K) acceptor residues of the previously attached Ub results in the forma-\ntion of a poly-Ub chain. Poly-Ub chains linked through lysine 48 (K48) target proteins for \ndegradation at the 26S proteasome. The residual poly-Ub chains are recycled into Ub mono-\nmers by deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes. DUBs can also trim or remove ubiquitin from \nubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Monoubiquitination and K63-linked polyubiquitination direct \nnon-proteasomal functions including endocytosis, protein trafficking, DNA repair, and tran-\nscription. Proteins possessing ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs) act as ubiquitin receptors. \nRecognition of ubiquitin moieties signals key regulatory events in biological pathways.

During infection, the \nubiquitin ligase E6-AP, also known as Ube3a (Fig. 2, Table 1), complexes with the \nE6 viral protein, causing the degradation of the p53 tumor suppressor and other \npathological substrates (247). Sequence alignment revealed conservation between the  \n \nFig. 2. E3 ligase subtype structure.  \nTwo principal classes of E3 ligases. (A) Two examples of HECT (homologous to E6-AP  \ncarboxyl terminus) domain E3 ligases are shown: Ube3a/E6-AP and NEDD4. Ube3a/E6-AP \ncontains an E6 substrate-binding domain and a C-terminal HECT domain. NEDD4 has an N-\nterminal C2 domain and several WW domains conferring cellular localization and substrate \nrecognition, and a C-terminal HECT domain. In both cases, ubiquitin moities are covalently \ncoupled to the HECT domain prior to being transferred to substrate lysine residues. (B) RING \ndomain E3 ligase. Two examples of unit RING E3 ligases are shown. Parkin has an N-terminal \nUBL domain and two RING-binding domains separated by an IBR (in between RING) domain. \nMdm2 has a single C-terminal RING domain along with an N-terminal p53-binding domain, a \nzinc finger (ZF) domain, a nuclear localization signal (NLS), a nuclear exclusion signal (NES), \nand a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS). RING domains recognize substrates and, by position-\ning substrates near cognate E2s, mediate the transfer of Ub from E2 enzymes to target proteins. \n(C) SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box) is a member of a multisubunit RING E3 ligase class where target \nproteins are recognized through members of the F-box family of proteins which are linked to \ncullin scaffolds by a Skp1 adaptor. A key feature of the cullin-RING E3 ligases is that each cullin \ncan assemble with any number of substrate receptors to form ubiquitin ligase complexes contain-\ning a common structural core but different substrate specificities."}

{"text": "===== Page 6 =====\n558 \nT.D. Helton and M.D. Ehlers \nAnother family of RING ubiquitin ligases is the cullin-RING ligases (82, 256). \nCullins are scaffold proteins with a distinct globular C-terminal domain (cullin ho-\nmology domain) and a series of N-terminal repeats of a five-helix bundle (cullin \nrepeats) (316). In mammals, cullin-RING ligases are composed of one of seven \nknown cullin proteins (CUL1, 2, 3, 4a, 4b, 5, and 7) and a catalytic RING protein. \nThe core complex is linked to specific targets by various adaptor proteins, most \nnotably F-box proteins. A well-studied group of cullin-RING ligases is the SCF \nfamily. The SCF ubiquitin ligases are multisubunit E3 ligases consisting of a \nCUL1/RING core and SKP1 and F-box proteins that confer substrate specificity \n(Fig. 2). The combination of the several identified classes of E3 ligases along with \nnumerous possible subunit combinations, such as the cullin proteins and diverse F-\nbox proteins, affords a capacity to recognize a wide array of target proteins for ubiq-\nuitination. \n2.2 The 26S Proteasome \n \nC-terminus of E6-AP, including the critical catalytic cysteine, and several seemingly \nunrelated proteins (123), defining the HECT class of E3 ligases. Most non-HECT \ndomain E3 enzymes possess a RING domain (81, 132, 173, 178) (Fig. 2). The RING \nclass of E3 enzymes is further subdivided into the plant homeobox domain/leukemia-\nassociated protein and U-box families, both characterized by small modifications in \ntheir RING domains. It is interesting to note that ubiquitin fusion degradation 2, the \nfirst identified U-box protein, is also classified as an E4 enzyme (154). E4 enzymes \nare a novel class of proteins that coordinate with E3 ligases and facilitate ubiquitin \nchain elongation.  \nThe 26S proteasome is a 2.5 MDa protein machine made up of two copies of at least \n32 different subunits that are highly conserved among eukaryotes (93). The protea-\nsome is an abundant complex making up approximately 1% of total cellular protein \n(168). The 26S proteasome has been localized to nearly every subcellular compart-\nment including the nucleus, nucleolus, and cytoplasm (302). The 26S proteasome \nitself is composed of two stable, multimeric complexes, the catalytic 20S particle and \nthe 19S regulatory complex (14, 289) (Fig. 1). The 20S component is composed of \nseven α and seven β subunits that assemble to form two α and two β heptameric \nrings. The rings are stacked to form a cylinder with two β rings bordered on each \nside by an α ring (Fig. 1) (14, 208). In eukaryotes, the two β heptameric rings con-\ntain multiple proteolytic sites. There are at least two trypsin-like, two chymotrypsin-\nlike, and two caspase-like proteolytic regions that act cooperatively to allow the \nproteasome to cleave target proteins at distinct peptide linkages. The base of the 19S \ncomponent is composed of eight subunits and a ring of six AAA family ATPases that \ngate the lumen of the proteasome and regulate the energy-dependent unfolding of \ntarget proteins (30, 94, 155, 206). Within the 19S complex, the S5a subunit (known \nas Rpn10 or Pus1 in budding yeast and fission yeast, respectively), Rad23, and one \nof the ATPases have been shown to interact with polyubiquitin chains and ubiquitin-\nlike protein domains (74, 75, 161, 283, 310), thereby participating in the targeting of \npolyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome."}
{"text": "===== Page 7 =====\nUbiquitin and Protein Degradation in Synapse Function\n559\n \n2.3 Deubiquitinating Enzymes \nJust as the addition of ubiquitin is carried out by ubiquitin ligases, there are more than \n70 deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in two major classes, both of which cleave the \nG76 isopeptide bond of ubiquitin (258). The ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCH) \nprocess ubiquitinated precursor molecules into their mature forms, as well as interact \nwith monoubiquitinated proteins (212, 295), and recycle ubiquitin from polyubiquiti-\nnated proteins at the proteasome to maintain a free ubiquitin pool (Fig. 1, Table 1) (4, \n26, 74, 102, 170). Ubiquitin-specific proteases (USP) have conserved 350-amino acid \ncore catalytic domains that disassemble polyubiquitinated protein chains (270). \n2.4 Degradative Pathway of Ubiquitinated Substrates  \n2.4.1.Ubiquitin Recognition  \nTarget proteins typically contain at least four K48-linked ubiquitin molecules that are \nable to bind the proteasome via S5a/Rpn10 (274), the major proteasome subunit \nknown to bind ubiquitin chains (see Section 2.2). Rpn10 contains a ubiquitin-binding \nsite within its C-terminus in a hydrophobic region containing a LALAL motif (86). \nThe carboxy termini of Rpn10 homologs (p54 from Drosophila and mammalian S5a) \ncontain two such hydrophobic repeats within their ubiquitin-interacting motifs \n(UIM), and both have been shown to bind ubiquitin (103, 310). While \nRpn10/p54/S5a is the primary proteasome subunit with an affinity for polyubiquitin \nchains, Rad23 can be co-precipitated with substrates that contain short multiubiquitin \nchains and contain a ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA) at the carboxy terminus of \nthe protein that can directly interact with ubiquitin (18, 114). Rad23 and its human \ncounterparts hHR23a and hHR23b bind to proteasomes via an amino terminal ubiq-\nuitin-like (UBL) domain which shares homology with ubiquitin (112, 246). While \nthese proteins have been shown to aid in ubiquitin recognition, it is likely that more \nproteins on the proteasome are involved in this process. \n2.4.2 Substrate Binding  \n2.4.3 Unfolding and Translocation  \nProteolysis of proteins by the proteasome is ATP-dependent (62, 108, 113). ATP \nhydrolysis cycles the regulatory 19S subunit between high- and low-affinity states, \nalternately binding and releasing substrates. The subsequent conformational changes \n \nRpn1 and Rpn2 comprise the proteasome base along with the six AAA ATPases. \nRpn1 and Rpn2 contain multiple leucine-rich repeats, regions that promote protein–\nprotein interactions with substrates (182). In order for substrate binding to occur, the \ntarget protein must be properly positioned to be unfolded by the base and translo-\ncated into the proteasome core. The distal positioning of the proteasome lid likely \nensures that ubiquitin chains conjugated to substrates do not occlude access of the \ntarget protein to the channel. The proteasome base can also bind to non-\nubiquitinated, unfolded substrates and promote their folding (30, 268)."}
{"text": "===== Page 8 =====\n560 \nT.D. Helton and M.D. Ehlers \n \nassociated with ATPase activity lead to gating of the proteolytic channel, substrate \nunfolding, and threading of the linearized substrate through the channel into the \ncatalytic lumen of the 20S core particle.  \nProtein unfolding is required for proteolysis because the estimated inner diame-\nter of the 20S subunit lumen is too narrow for proteins to enter in their native state. \nATP hydrolysis alters 19S subunit affinities for substrate proteins, thus stabilizing \nthem in an unfolded state. The location of the proteasome base points to its role in \npromoting substrate unfolding. The base, with its six ATPases, covers the entry ports \ninto the 20S core particle. The archaea proteasome base homolog, PAN, unfolds \nproteins before translocation to the 20S subunit (205, 318). Similar to the 19S regula-\ntory particle, the 20S subunit also binds unfolded proteins in an ATP-dependent \nmanner, releasing them in vitro (30, 268). Thus, substrates are translocated from one \ndomain within the proteasome (19S) to another (20S) in an ATP-dependent manner. \n2.4.4 Gating  \n2.4.5 Proteolysis  \nTypically, the proteasome cleaves protein substrates into peptides from 3 to 23 \namino acids in length (149, 213). This process is restrictive such that a protein is \nhydrolyzed within the proteasome to its final products before the next substrate en-\nters, leading to a pattern of generated peptides from a specific substrate that is stable \nover time (148, 210). The resulting peptide products are likely rapidly hydrolyzed by \ndownstream proteases and aminopeptidases.  \nThe 20S core particle has the ability to cleave peptide bonds after any amino \nacid, but each of the three active site-containing β-subunits preferentially cleaves \nafter specific amino acids. The β1-subunit has been shown to cleave after acidic or \nsmall hydrophobic amino acids, β2 cleaves after small hydrophobic or basic amino \nacids, while β5 hydrolyzes the peptide bond after hydrophobic residues (64). Inter-\nestingly, the 20S core particle and the proteasome holoenzyme can generate different \nThe N-termini of α-subunits in the α-rings obstruct access to the proteolytic chamber \nof the 20S core particle (see Fig. 1), indicating that the proteasome channel is gated \n(99, 100). The N-terminus of α3 is distinct from the other α-subunits in that it points \ndirectly across the α-ring surface toward the center of the lumen contacting every \nother α-subunit. For substrates to enter and exit the proteolytic core, the blocking N-\nterminal residues of these α-subunits must be altered. The formation of the well-\ndefined closed configuration of the gate requires dramatic changes in the structure of \nthe core particle. A possible mechanism for gating activation is the attachment of the \n19S regulatory particle to the core particle. Attachment of the 19S regulatory particle \nto the α-ring forms competing interactions with tyrosine, aspartate, or arginine resi-\ndues in the α-subunits themselves. This realignment then allows the passage of un-\nfolded substrates into the core particle. It has been shown that the Rpt2-α3 (one of \nthe six AAA ATPases and one of the 19S α-subunits, respectively) pairing is in-\nvolved in the gating of the channel into the core particle. However, it is possible that \ngating is controlled by more than one Rpt-α interaction (60, 85, 99, 155, 237)."}

This implies \nthat the 19S regulatory particle can affect the behavior of the core particle. \n2.4.6 Deubiquitination  \nFree ubiquitin is also a product of the proteasome. After proteolysis, ubiquitin, or \nubiquitin attached to residual peptide chains, is released from the proteasome and \nrecycled back into the ubiquitin pathway (Fig. 1, Table 1) (116, 270). In order to \ndismantle polyubiquitin chains, a deubiquitinating enzyme must work in conjunction \nwith the 19S regulatory particle to replenish the monoubiquitin pool. The 19S regula-\ntory particle from various sources has been shown to possess ubiquitin hydrolase \nactivity leading to editing or complete removal of ubiquitin from protein substrates \n(78, 160, 162, 167). The 19S regulatory particle p37a is thought to be responsible for \nthis deubiquitinating activity in Drosophila. Doa4 has been suggested as the deubiq-\nuitinating subunit of the 19S regulatory particle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (218), \nand the 19S lid subunit Rpn11/POH1 has been shown to have deubiquitinating activ-\nity in mammals (228). The deubiquitinating enzyme USP14 (the mammalian  \nhomolog to yeast Ubp6p) has also been shown to associate with mammalian protea-\nsomes (26). \n2.5 Protein Domains That Bind or Mimic Ubiquitin \nVarious adaptor proteins that regulate protein degradation and trafficking possess \nprotein domains that bind or mimic ubiquitin (110, 146). These domains include \nubiquitin-associated (UBA), ubiquitin-like (UBL), and ubiquitin E2-variant (UEV) \ndomains, as well as ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIM), and CUE domains. The \nstructure of UPS adaptor proteins points to the general function of these domains. \nFor example, the DNA repair protein Rad23 in yeast contains two UBA domains and \nan N-terminal UBL domain (232). This protein arrangement indicates that Rad23 has \nthe ability to bind polyubiquitinated proteins via its UBA domain while simultane-\nously docking with the proteasome through its UBL domain.  \n \nA number of proteins associated with the endocytic pathway have UIM domains \nincluding Eps15, Eps15R, epsins, and Hrs (151, 229, 233, 253). Eps15 and Hrs form \nprotein complexes that mediate sorting of ubiquitinated membrane cargo in the lu-\nmen of endocytic vesicles that are destined for lysosomal degradation. The Hrs-UIM \nhas recently been shown to simultaneously bind two ubiquitin molecules (111). This \ndouble ubiquitin-interacting motif (DUIM)-binding ability is thought to make Hrs-\nubiquitin interaction more efficient, assisting in endosomal sorting. As another ex-\nample, Tsg101 (the mammalian homolog to yeast Vps23), a component of the \nESCRT-I complex, contains a UEV domain that participates in sorting ubiquitinated \ncargo in late endocytic compartments (further discussed in the next section). On the \nother hand, CUE domains are structurally related to UBA domains. The ubiquitin-\nbinding CUE domain of the yeast protein Vps9 and Vps9 domain-containing proteins \nin mammals have conserved functions in intracellular receptor trafficking through \nthe endocytic pathway (40). These proteins are discussed in further detail in the \nfollowing sections."}
{"text": "===== Page 10 =====\n562 \nT.D. Helton and M.D. Ehlers \n \n2.6 Ubiquitination in the Endocytic Pathway \nIn all eukaryotic cells, a highly organized network of endosomes facilitates protein \ntrafficking between the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and the plasma membrane. \nUbiquitination and ubiquitin adaptor proteins regulate cargo endocytosis from the \nplasma membrane and subsequent sorting in the endocytic pathway (37, 132, 151, \n192, 229, 233, 253, 261, 298). Often, the addition of ubiquitin itself can trigger sur-\nface protein internalization of a variety of transmembrane proteins, including ion \nchannels, G protein-coupled receptors, and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) (109, \n195, 252, 264). \nThe epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an extensively studied model of \ncell signaling and receptor internalization through the endocytic pathway. EGFRs are \nRTKs involved in controlling the proliferation, differentiation, migration, adhesion, \nand survival of numerous mammalian cell types including neurons. EGF binding \ninduces the dimerization of EGFRs which form docking sites for Src-homology-2 \n(SH2) domain effector proteins (Fig. 3). Upon ligand binding, the internalization of \nEGFRs is mediated by the SH2 domain-containing E3 RING ubiquitin ligase Cbl. At \nthe cell surface, activated, dimerized EGFRs enter clathrin-coated pits where the \nmultiubiquitinated receptor-Cbl complex associates with Cbl-interacting protein of \n85 kDa (CIN85) and endophilins (Fig. 3). At this point, EGFRs autophosphorylate \nand induce the monoubiquitination of EGFR-pathway substrate-15 (Eps15) and \nepsin, the latter of which interacts with the plasma membrane. As indicated in the \nprevious section, Eps15 and epsin contain UIMs. These domains promote interac-\ntions between EGFRs and Eps15/epsin via ubiquitin binding. Interestingly, \nmonoubiquitinated epsin loses its ability to interact with AP2 and clathrin indicating \nthat ubiquitination may promote the release of internalized EGFRs from clathrin \nadaptor proteins (187). \nOn early endosomes, the hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase \nsubstrate (Hrs) binds to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) where it as-\nsembles in a ternary complex with signal transduction adaptor molecule (STAM) and \nEps15 (Fig. 3) (11). Once internalized into early endosomes, EGFRs are either  \nrecycled back to the cell surface or sorted to multivesicular endosomes \n(MVE)/multivesicular bodies (MVB) where Hrs interacts with Tsg101 (Fig. 3), a \ncomponent of the ESCRT-I complex. The mammalian ESCRT-I complex, consisting \nof Tsg101, Vps28, and one of four isotypes of Vps37(A-D), binds to ubiquitin \nthrough the N-terminal UEV domain of Tsg101 increasing the efficiency of ubiquiti-\nnated cargo sorting (19). \nThe next step in MVE/MVB sorting includes the association of ESCRT-II with \nvesicular cargo (Fig. 3). ESCRT-II consists of Vps22, Vps25, and Vps36. The N-\nterminus of Vps36 has been termed a GLUE (GRAM-like ubiquitin binding in EAP45) \ndomain which binds ubiquitin in vitro (257). In yeast, ESCRT-II binds ESCRT-I with \nhigh affinity through an interaction with the Vps36 GLUE domain and the Vps28 \nsubunit of ESCRT-I (92). In yeast and Drosophila, deletion of ESCRT-II components \nresults in missorting of vacuolar hydrolases and surface accumulation of Notch, respec-\ntively (273). In mammalian cells, siRNA-mediated depletion of ESCRT-II inhibits the \ndownregulation of specific cell surface receptors (163)."}

Ubiquitin in receptor trafficking.  \nThe EGF receptor is a model for ubiquitin-dependent receptor trafficking. Upon binding \nligand, EGFRs dimerize and autophosphorylate their tyrosine residues. Activated EGFRs then \nenter clathrin-coated pits where the phosphorylated receptors recruit the E3 ubiquitin ligase \nCbl, which multiubiquitinates the EGFR leading to an association with the Cbl-interacting \nprotein of 85 kDa (CIN85) and endophilins. The clathrin adaptors epsin and Eps15 form a \ncomplex and bind to monoubiquitinated EGFRs through their ubiquitin-interacting motifs \n(UIMs). Within early endosomes, Hrs binds to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) \nforming a multiprotein complex with signal transduction adaptor molecule (STAM) and Eps15 \nwhich in turn interacts with EGFRs. Hrs and STAM bind ubiquitin directly through their UIM \ndomains, and Hrs undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation after receptor tyrosine kinase activation. \nIn early endosomes, EGFRs can be either recycled back to the cell surface or directed to the \nmultivesicular endosome/multivesicular body (MVE/MVB) for degradation. At the \nMVE/MVB, Hrs binds to Tsg101, a UIM-containing component of the ESCRT-I complex. \nThis interaction shuttles endocytosed EGFRs to ESCRT-II and ESCRT-III complexes and \nthen into the intralumenal vesicles of MVEs/MVBs. Following invagination into \nMVEs/MVBs, EGFRs are then degraded by delivery to the lysosome."}
{"text": "===== Page 12 =====\n564 \nT.D. Helton and M.D. Ehlers \n3 The Ubiquitin–Proteasome System in Synapse Development \n3.1 Axon Growth, Steering, and Pruning \nThe yeast ESCRT-III complex consists of Vps2, Vps24, Snf7, and Vps20 which \nform two subcomplexes (Fig. 3) (9). Studies have suggested that ESCRT-III proteins \nexist in a stable, monomeric closed form where the C-terminal region blocks het-\nerodimerization with the cores of other ESCRT-III subunits until an activation signal \nremoves it (176, 311). The activated, open-form subunits are then thought to assem-\nble into ESCRT-III lattices on the endosomal membrane (9, 287). Although yet un-\nproven, it is proposed that the ESCRT-III lattices spatially restrict membrane curva-\nture-inducing factors to initiate budding toward the lumen. ESCRT-III subunit \nactivation triggers interactions with components of the MVB pathway such as the \nVps25 subunit of ESCRT-II (Fig. 3) (10, 272) and PtdIns(3,5)P2 (294). In yeast, \ndeletion of ESCRT-III subunits results in endocytic cargo accumulation, and deple-\ntion of the ESCRT-III subunit Vps24 in mammalian cells inhibits the degradation of \nEGFRs (12, 117). As a final step, the protein Vps4 is required for proper disassembly \nof ESCRT components and sorting of cargo to MVBs (Fig. 3). The N-terminus of \nVps4 has been shown to interact with C-terminal regions of ESCRT-III proteins (9, \n176). In yeast, all ESCRT complexes remain tightly associated with membranes in \nthe absence of Vps4 (9, 209), and it has been shown in mammalian cells that Vps4 \nfunction is required to disassemble clathrin coats on endocytotic vesicles (239). \nWhile the major components of the MVB pathway have largely been identified, \nseveral questions remain. What is the molecular organization of the ESCRT-III lat-\ntice, what is its function, and how is it disassembled? Do the multiple mammalian \nESCRT subunits have distinct roles in the endocytic pathway or are they redundant? \nHow does cargo ubiquitination and endosomal sorting regulate membrane composi-\ntion in highly compartmentalized cells such as neurons? \nUbiquitin-dependent protein trafficking has been implicated in early axonal growth \ncone migration. Two of the better characterized proteins in axon guidance are the \nroundabout (Robo) and DCC/Frazzled (Fra) receptors that respond to extracellular \nmigration signals. DCC/FRA is an attractant receptor that responds to the secreted \nprotein Netrin-1, while the repellent receptor Robo responds to secreted Slit protein \nligand (32, 61). Growth cone surface expression of either DCC/FRA or Robo is in-\nvolved in proper steering of the growth cone. During early growth cone development, \nRobo expression is controlled by an association with Commisureless (Comm), prevent-\ning Robo cell surface expression by facilitating Robo targeting to the lysosome for \ndegradation (89, 140). At this stage, the absence of Robo ensures that the growth cone \nwill continue migrating toward the midline. The HECT domain E3 ligase Nedd4 rec-\nognizes Comm and the subsequent ubiquitination of Comm/Robo regulates its delivery \nto lysosomes for degradation (Table 1) (203). Once the growth cone has crossed the \nmidline, transcriptional regulation mechanisms diminish Comm expression leading to \nRobo expression on the surface of the growth cone (140). In contrast to Robo, \nDCC/FRA expression on the surface of the growth cone leads to steering toward the \nmidline. DCC/FRA is polyubiquitinated by the RING domain E3 ligase Siah and"}
{"text": "===== Page 13 =====\nUbiquitin and Protein Degradation in Synapse Function\n565\n \nInterestingly, as Robo signaling directs the growth cone toward its synaptic target, \nformation of the synapse requires an elimination of Comm surface expression (303). \nWithout Comm removal, synaptogenesis fails. Comm localizes to intracellular vesicles \nin muscle and endocytosis of Comm requires binding to dNedd4 via its two PY motifs \nand accompanying ubiquitination of Comm (125). Comm has also been shown to \nregulate the delivery of Robo to the growth cone (141). Muscle surface accumulation \nof Comm and innervation defects are observed when dNedd4 is knocked down by \nRNAi in the muscle or in muscles overexpressing catalytically inactive dNedd4. Ex-\npression of Comm mutants fused to a single ubiquitin which cannot be polyubiquiti-\nnated prevents the defects in both Comm endocytosis and synaptogenesis, suggesting \nthat monoubiquitination is sufficient for Comm endocytosis in muscles (125). Expres-\nsion of Comm mutants after synaptic innervation has no effect.  \nAnother regulator of axon growth is the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) \n(Table 1). The APC is a multimeric ubiquitin ligase complex that is well known to \nmediate progression through the cell cycle (222, 223). In the brain, the APC im-\nmunopurifies as a catalytically active ubiquitin ligase from brain extracts and is \npresent in postmitotic neurons (91). Knocking down the APC co-activator Cdh1 in \ndissociated cerebellar granule neurons using RNA interference (RNAi) increased \naxonal growth rates while leaving dendritic growth unaltered (156). Dominant nega-\ntive forms of the catalytic APC11 subunit (172, 271), as well as the APC inhibitor \nEmi1 (234, 235), likewise increase axonal growth rates. Similarly, Cdh1-depleted \nneurons in vitro grow over myelinated substrates and exhibit random growth patterns \nwhen plated on cerebellar slices, while in vivo, the parallel fibers of cerebellar gran-\nule neurons transfected with Cdh1-specific RNAi defasciculate and move away from \nnormal anatomic pathways (156).  \nsubsequently degraded (Table 1) (118). Robo, Comm, and DCC/Fra have also been \nimplicated in dendritic growth, indicating that ubiquitin-dependent regulation of guid-\nance molecule receptors is not restricted to axons (87).  \nThe APCCdh1 also targets inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2) and the transcriptional \ncorepressor SnoN for degradation (Fig. 4) (164, 265). Id2 is a member of the Id fam-\nily of proteins linked to cell proliferation and tumor progression. Id2 inhibits basic \nhelix–loop–helix (bHLH) transcription factors that limit axonal growth. Activation of \nAPCCdh1 targets Id2 for degradation through a destruction box motif (D box) motif \nconserved in Id1 and Id4. Id2 D box mutants, which are resistant to APCCdh1 degrada-\ntion, enhance axonal growth in cerebellar granule neurons and overcome the myelin \ninhibitory signals for growth (164). Conversely, bHLH activation induces genes with \nstrong axonal inhibitory functions including the Nogo receptor, a known effector of \nmyelin inhibition (164). The APCCdh1 has also been shown to operate in the nucleus \nand inhibit axonal growth and patterning in the mammalian brain (265). The APCCdh1 \nhas been shown to physically interact with SnoN initiating the ubiquitin-dependent \nproteasomal degradation of SnoN in rat cerebellar granule neurons in vitro. RNAi \nknockdown of SnoN reduces axonal growth and suppresses APCCdh1 RNAi-enhanced \naxon outgrowth (265). Furthermore, in vivo knockdown of SnoN in developing rat \ncerebellum significantly impairs the development of granule neuron parallel fibers by \ninhibiting their growth and/or stabilization (265). These findings point to the APCCdh1 \nas an important mediator in the control of axonal morphogenesis."}

The UPS regulates many aspects of synaptic physiology.  \nPresynaptic monoubiquitination (Mono-Ub) modulates endocytosis and interactions of endo-\ncytic adaptors. Polyubiquitination (Poly-Ub) and proteasomal degradation alter the abundance \nof synaptic proteins. Presynaptic effects include (1) the regulation of neurotransmitter release \nby proteolysis of Munc-13, (2) regulation of vesicle dynamics by Ca2+ and calcineurin-\ndependent modulation of fat facets/FAM activity on epsin 1, (3) regulation of synapse growth \nand development by Highwire/RPM-1, FSN-1, and the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) fat \nfacets/FAM, and (4) APCCdh1 regulation of the axonal transcription factor Id2.

These results show \nthat LIN-23 activity is important for multiple stages of nervous system development.  \nFurther evidence from Xenopus retinal ganglion neurons demonstrates that the \nUPS is important for growth cone steering. Isolated growth cones from Xenopus \nretinal ganglion neurons are highly enriched with ubiquitin, proteasomes, and E1 \nenzymes. In addition, pharmacological blockade of the proteasome leads to a de-\ncrease in growth cone sensitivity to extracellular guidance molecules (39, 282). \nThese findings show that the presence of a functional UPS is essential for proper \naxonal growth and guidance.  \nFurther supporting a role for the UPS in axon guidance is the finding that Rnf6, a \nRING domain ubiquitin ligase, targets LIM kinase 1 in mammalian neurons (Table 1, \nFig. 4) (278). LIM kinase 1 is a Rho GTPase effector that modulates cellular mor-\nphology via phosphorylation of the actin depolymerizing factor cofilin (7, 306). \nCofilin phosphorylation disrupts its association with actin, thereby increasing fila-\nmentous actin in the cell. Proteasomal inhibition in hippocampal neurons leads to \nincreased levels of LIM kinase 1 while Rnf6, which polyubiquitinates LIM kinase 1 \nin vitro, has been shown to coimmunoprecipitate along with LIM kinase 1 (278). \nRnf6 localizes to growth cones, and overexpression of an Rnf6 mutant lacking its \nRING domain and RNAi knockdown of Rnf6 both increase axon growth (278). In \ncontrast, wild-type Rnf6 overexpression suppresses axon growth (278). It is widely \naccepted that local actin polymerization and depolymerization are important con-\ntributors to axon formation and growth (29), and thus localized proteasomal activity \nmay be involved in modulating actin cytoskeletal changes that induce directional \nextension of neurites. \nThe UPS also influences neuronal differentiation by modulating the levels and \nactivity of small GTPases such as Rap1B and Rho family members. Sequential \nRap1B-Cdc42 activity is needed for establishment of hippocampal neuron polarity. \nFurthermore, Rap1B is initially present at the tips of all neurites of unpolarized early \nstage 2 neurons, but is then later restricted to a single late stage 2 neurite (249). The \nconfinement of Rap1B is required to establish neuronal polarity, and recent evidence \npoints to selective degradation of Rap1B by the UPS as a mechanism to discriminate \nwhich neurite becomes an axon. The HECT domain E3 ligase Smurf2 regulates \nneurite extension and polarity through Rap1B (Table 1, Fig. 4). Smurf2 ubiquitinates \ninactive Rap1B, initiating its degradation via the UPS. In cultured, stage 3 rat hippo-\ncampal neurons, overexpression of wild-type Smurf2 leads to a loss of neuronal \npolarity while overexpression of a catalytically inactive Smurf2 mutant results in \nneurons with supernumerary axons and a significant reduction in minor neurites \n(248). Thus, the E3 ligase Smurf2 modulates axonal outgrowth by ubiquitinating \nRap1B, initiating its UPS degradation. The degradation of Rap1B then allows the \nrestriction of axonal outgrowth to a single neurite. Intriguingly, in non-neuronal \ncells, Par6 phosphorylation recruits Smurf1 which in turn degrades RhoA to locally \nregulate cell polarity, migration, and motility (214, 240, 292). Similar mechanisms \nhave been shown to control neurite outgrowth (34)."}
{"text": "===== Page 16 =====\n568 \nT.D. Helton and M.D. Ehlers \n \nThe UPS is also involved in axonal degeneration. Axonal degeneration is a \ncommon pathological characteristic of many neurodegenerative diseases. In studies \nof rat transected axons, termed Wallerian degeneration, pharmacological and genetic \ninhibition of the UPS markedly delays axon degeneration both in vitro and in vivo \n(312). Also, similar to transected axons, degeneration of axons from nerve growth \nfactor (NGF)-deprived sympathetic neurons is also suppressed by proteasome inhibi-\ntors (312). In a further study of both developmental and Wallerian axonal degenera-\ntion, Wlds mutant mice, which overexpress a chimeric protein consisting of the first \n70 amino acids of the UPS protein UFD2/E4 and the full-length nicotinamide mono-\nnucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nmnat), an enzyme that facilitates NAD synthesis, \nprotects against degeneration of injury-induced retinal ganglion cells (115). In  \ncontrast, overexpression of the Wlds protein does not effect the naturally occurring \ndegeneration of these same axonal projections during the identical developmental \ntime period (115). These data indicate that naturally occurring developmental degen-\nerative axonal pruning and injury-induced axon degeneration differ significantly in \nearly steps, but may ultimately converge onto a common pathway which may  \ninvolve the UPS.  \n3.2 The UPS in Synapse Formation and Elimination  \n3.2.1 Pam/Highwire/RPM-1  \nOne of the first links discovered between the UPS and synapses was the isolation of \nthe Drosophila mutant highwire (hiw). The hiw mutant results from a disruption in \nthe function of a RING domain E3 ligase (290, 304), resulting in a variety of mor-\nphological and signaling defects at neuromuscular synapses (Table 1, Fig. 5) (304). \nSpecifically, highwire loss-of-function mutations result in excessive synaptic bouton \nformation and reductions in both quantal size and content (290, 304). Interestingly, \nhiw loss-of-function mutants are phenocopied by the gain of function in a deubiquit-\ninating enzyme called fat facets (Table 1, Fig. 4) (37, 63, 121). Such a phenotypic \nsimilarity shows that a proper balance between ubiquitination and deubiquitination \nevents is critical for synaptic development. \nInterestingly, the conserved Pam/Highwire/RPM-1 class of proteins, consisting \nof Drosophila highwire, its C. elegans ortholog RPM-1, and the mammalian \northologs Phr1 and Pam are all involved in synapse development (36, 101, 244, 290, \n314). As discussed above, highwire mutants in Drosophila display normal neuro-\nmuscular junction motor axon targeting and synaptogenesis, but synapse growth is \nexcessive with increases in both the number of boutons and the overall length of \naxonal branches (Fig. 5) (290). Similarly, RPM-1 loss-of-function C. elegans mu-\ntants display retracted synaptic branches, ectopically extended axons, and altered \nNMJ phenotypes including motor neuron overgrowth which often manifests as a \nsingle large presynaptic terminal with multiple active zones (Fig. 5) (244, 314). \nMoreover, mice lacking the RPM-1 ortholog Phr1 exhibit incomplete diaphragm \ninnervation by the phrenic nerve, and at a more detailed level, nerve terminal mor-\nphologies are disrupted as NMJs show excessive postsynaptic sprouting of nerve \nterminals (36)."}

The Pam/Highwire/RPM-1 (PHR) family of ubiquitin ligases regulates synapse forma-\ntion and function. In flies (highwire), worms (RPM-1), and mammals (Pam/Phr), PHR family \nubiquitin ligases control axonal sprouting, synapse morphology, and maintenance of synaptic \ntransmission. Loss-of-function mutations in the Highwire/RPM-1/Pam E3 ligase result in \nsynaptic defects including excessive synaptic bouton formation and reductions in both quantal \nsize and content, retracted synaptic branches, ectopically extended axons, and excessive post-\nsynaptic accumulation of nerve terminals. Phenotypes vary between worms, flies, and mam-\nmals, but have been best studied at the Drosophila neuromuscular synapse, and mechanosen-\nsory and motor synapses in C. elegans. \n \nIn addition to the conserved function of the Pam/Highwire/RPM-1 class of pro-\nteins, the signaling components of the highwire pathway are also conserved. A genetic \nscreen in Drosophila for modulators of the highwire phenotype identified mutations in \nwallenda, a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase (MAPK.KK) of the \np38 pathway (52).  \nWhile mutations in highwire lead to neuromuscular synapse defects, this pheno-\ntype is suppressed by loss-of-function mutations in wallenda, which is consistent \nwith the idea that wallenda is negatively regulated by highwire (52). In C. elegans, \nscreens for suppressors of the RPM-1 loss-of-function phenotype identified the \nwallenda homolog DLK-1 (204). DLK-1 loss-of-function mutants show no signifi-\ncant changes in synaptic growth, but DLK-1 loss of function in an RPM-1 mutant \nbackground suppresses the RPM-1 mutant synaptic overgrowth phenotype (204). \nAlthough the complete pathway remains to be elucidated, these data indicate that \nHighwire/RPM-1 modulates a key signaling pathway involving the p38 MAPK \npathway that promotes synaptic growth.

Helton and M.D. Ehlers \n \n3.2.2 Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC)  \nIn addition to its role in axonal outgrowth, the APC also promotes differentiation of \npresynaptic boutons and formation of functional synapses at Drosophila neuromuscu-\nlar synapses (Table 1). Mutations in components of the APC lead to alterations in neu-\nromuscular synapse development. Flies expressing a truncated form of the cullin do-\nmain APC component protein APC2 survive to early pupal stages and display \nexpanded neuromuscular synapse size (280). This augmentation in synaptic size results \nfrom a twofold increase in the number of presynaptic terminals per endplate without an \nincrease in the size of individual boutons (280). These malformations correspond to \nenhanced spontaneous and evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents and an increase in \npostsynaptic clustering of glutamate receptors. Mutations in APC subunits in C. ele-\ngans increase the abundance of GLR-1 in the ventral nerve cord resulting in locomotor \ndefects consistent with increased synaptic strength (134). Mutations that disrupt \nclathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibit the effects of the APC mutations, indicating that \nthe APC regulates GLR-1 endocytosis or endocytic recycling (134). \nRecent studies at the mammalian neuromuscular junction have identified a PDZ \ndomain containing RING finger 3 (PDZRN3) as a synapse-associated E3 ubiquitin \nligase that regulates the surface expression of the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine \nkinase (MuSK) (Table 1), the key organizer of postsynaptic NMJ development (181). \nPDZRN3 binds to MuSK and promotes its ubiquitination, leading to endocytic re-\nmoval of MuSK from the muscle membrane. Gain- and loss-of-function studies in \ncultured myotubes and transgenic mice show that downregulation of MuSK by \n \nand overdeveloped synapses including presynaptic densities with single, presynaptic \nvesicle clusters or undifferentiated synaptic varicosities with single clusters of synap-\ntic vesicles (Fig. 3, right) (244, 314). RPM-1 is part of a cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase \ncomplex where the F-box component, such as FSN-1, is interchangeable and deter-\nmines substrate specificity (Table 1) (5). The multiple effects of RPM-1/FSN-1 loss-\nof-function mutants may indicate the existence of synapse-specific cullin-RING \ncomplexes that direct the growth and maturation of distinct synapses by targeting \ndiscrete substrates, such as DLK-1, in certain synaptic populations. \nAnother putative neuronal substrate for the APC, liprin-α, was identified \nthrough database homology screens using the conserved APC destruction box motif \nRXXLXXXXN as a template (Fig. 4) (95, 144, 280). Liprin-α has been shown to \naffect NMJ bouton numbers in flies (139) while its C. elegans ortholog, SYD2, regu-\nlates synapse size and function (315). Furthermore, the multi-PDZ domain protein \nGRIP/ABP binds to liprin-α and, through an association with LAR receptor protein \ntyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs), clusters AMPA receptors at mammalian exci-\ntatory synapses (Table 1) (305). Loss-of-function APCmr3 (the Drosophila ortholog \nof APC2) mutant flies show a 33% increase in presynaptic levels of liprin-α, while a \nsimultaneous expression of loss function liprin-α rescues the APCmr3 phenotype \n(280). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that liprin-α is in \na monoubiquitinated form in vivo (280). These data indicate that the APC can modu-\nlate liprin-α activity during synapse development."}

Droso-\nphila larvae class IV dendritic arborization (C4da) neurons undergo extensive den-\ndritic pruning during metamorphosis and this pruning is regulated by UPS activity \n(158). Specifically, mutations in the Drosophila E1 enzyme uba1 and the proteasome \nsubunit mov34 prevent pruning of C4da neuron larval dendrites during metamorpho-\nsis (158). Subsequent genetic screens identified the E2-conjugating enzyme UbcD1 \nand the RING E3 ligase Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (DIAP1) as key \ncomponents in the pruning of C4da dendrites (Table 1) (159). The antiapoptotic \nprotein DIAP1 protects neurons from apoptosis by downregulating Dronc caspase \nactivity by targeting Dronc for proteasomal degradation (201, 299). Loss of DIAP1 \nleads to increased Dronc activity resulting in caspase activation and cleavage of \nproximal dendrites in C4da neurons during metamorphosis. C4da neurons lacking \nDronc have normal dendrites at early larval stages but fail to cleave their larval  \nSimilar to synapse formation, the UPS also regulates synapse elimination. The \nspine-associated Rap GTPase-activating protein (SPAR) (Fig. 4), an actin-binding \npositive regulator of spine growth that localizes to the PSD via its interaction with \npostsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) (217), undergoes proteasomal degradation \nafter phosphorylation by serum-inducible kinase (SNK, Table 1), also known as \npolo-like kinase 2 (Plk2) (216). SPAR overexpression creates enlarged spines with \nincreased PSD-95 content in cultured hippocampal neurons. Conversely, SNK/Plk2 \noverexpression with simultaneous phosphorylation of SPAR eliminates spines (216, \n217). SNK and SPAR are thus thought to play a role in homeostatic synaptic plastic-\nity by dampening synaptic signaling during chronic increases in activity (see chapter \nby Turrigiano, this issue).  \nThe UPS is also involved in synapse elimination in C. elegans. In adult worms, \nthe hermaphrodite-specific motor neuron (HSNL) interfaces with its vulval muscle \nand VC motor neuron targets via a cluster of synapses in the primary synapse region \n(PSR). Experiments have shown that stereotypical developmental elimination of \nHSNL synapses is mediated by an SCF E3 ligase complex consisting of SKR-1 and \nthe F-box protein SEL-10 (65). RNAi knockdown of SKR-1 and another obligatory \ncomponent of the SCF complex CUL-1 resulted in a marked decrease in synapse \nelimination in the PSR over control animals (65). Furthermore, the immunoglobulin \nsuperfamily synaptic adhesion molecule SYG-1 (NEPH1 and IrreC in mouse and \nDrosophila, respectively), which is exclusively expressed in the PSR during devel-\nopmental stages, binds to SKR-1 (65) and inhibits SCF complex assembly. This \ninhibition results in protection of local synapses in the PSR (65). These data indicate \nthat the localization and regulation of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation  \ncan contribute to maintaining detailed synaptic connectivity via selective synapse \nelimination."}

Mutations in UbcD1 also lead to retention of \nintact, non-severed larval dendrites 18 h after puparium formation (APF), whereas \nwild-type C4da neurons lose dendrites over this same period (159). Furthermore, \ngain-of-function DIAP1 mutants hinder larval neuron dendrite pruning. These ex-\nperiments emphasize the importance of the UPS in large-scale remodeling of den-\ndrites and postsynaptic contacts during development. \n4 The UPS in Synaptic Function \n4.1 UPS-Dependent Mechanisms of Presynaptic Regulation \nRecent studies indicate that dynamic cycles of ubiquitination and deubiquitination in \npresynaptic terminals regulate neurotransmitter release. In isolated synaptosomes, \nacute depolarization causes a rapid decrease in ubiquitin-immunopositive proteins \n(44). This loss of ubiquitin conjugates is Ca2+ dependent and is blocked by inhibitors \nof the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin/PP2B (44). Furthermore, proteasome \ninhibitors only partially block the depolarization-induced loss of ubiquitin conju-\ngates, indicating that the loss of ubiquitin immunoreactivity is due principally to \ndeubiquitination rather than proteasomal degradation. Consistent with this notion, \nRNAi knockdown of FAM, a mammalian ortholog of the DUB fat facets, causes the \nUIM protein epsin-1 to remain monoubiquitinated after depolarization, in turn alter-\ning presynaptic vesicle release dynamics by altering adaptor interactions involving \ncomponents of the endocytic pathway (Table 1, Fig. 4) (44). \nUbiquitin recycling and regulation of free pools of monomeric ubiquitin also \nplay an important role in regulating neuronal function. The ataxia mouse, which \ndisplays severe tremors and undergoes premature death (57, 300), is deficient in the \nDUB enzyme Usp14 (Table 1), a mammalian homolog of the yeast deubiquitinating \nenzyme Ubp6 (300). Usp14/Ubp6 directly interacts with the proteasome and func-\ntions to remove and recycle ubiquitin molecules from ubiquitinated proteins bound to \nthe proteasome (Fig. 4) (26, 170). Interestingly, wild-type mice have 35% greater \nmonomeric ubiquitin levels in neural tissues compared to ataxia mice (4). This de-\ncrease in free ubiquitin seen in ataxia mice can be rescued in the brain by expression \nof a full-length Usp14 transgene (56). Electrophysiological characteristics of ataxia \nmice, including defects in hippocampal short-term plasticity as well as increased \namplitudes but decreased frequencies of miniature endplate potentials at neuromus-\ncular synapses, suggest that Usp14 defects alter presynaptic function (300). \nProtein degradation after ubiquitination also has significant effects on presynap-\ntic function. In cultured hippocampal neurons, proteasome inhibitors increased FM-\ndye uptake after a 1 min, 90 mM K+ depolarization, by more than 75% over control, \nwhereas the rate and magnitude of dye release were unaltered (296). This increase in \nFM-dye uptake is not dependent on protein synthesis but does require neuronal activ-\nity as it is blocked by TTX and augmented by elevating action potential frequency \nthrough blockade of inhibitory GABAA receptors (296). These observations indicate \nthat proteasomal degradation at the presynaptic terminal negatively regulates neuro-\ntransmitter release during times of increased activity.

Both LTP and LTD are Ca2+-dependent processes requiring the \nactivation of kinase and phosphatase cascades, which lead to synaptic strengthening \nor weakening, respectively (119, 186, 199, 200). LTP and LTD result in long-lasting \nalterations in synaptic strength caused by enduring changes in synapse structure and \nprotein composition. Traditionally, changes in macromolecular synthesis, including \ngene transcription and local protein synthesis, were thought to cause long-lasting \nsynaptic remodeling (142, 143, 267). However, recent evidence points to an  \nimportant role for ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation in enduring synaptic \nmodification. \n \nPotential presynaptic proteasome substrates include the vesicle priming protein \nMunc-13, which plays an important role in action potential-evoked neurotransmitter \nrelease (13, 33, 260). Pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome or genetic altera-\ntion of the proteasome was found to increase the accumulation of Munc-13, resulting \nin decreased neurotransmitter release (33, 260). Conversely, anisomycin, a protein \nsynthesis inhibitor, had no effect on synaptic currents, demonstrating the specific \ninvolvement of protein degradation (260). Interestingly, RIM1, which is a binding \npartner for Munc-13, is degraded by the synaptic F-box E3 ligase SCRAPPER. \nScrapper knockout mice display elevated levels of RIM1 and altered synaptic activ-\nity (Table 1) (308).  \nUbiquitin-dependent protein trafficking also controls neurotransmitter reuptake \ninto nerve terminals. The HECT domain E3 ligase Nedd4-2 has been shown to regu-\nlate dopamine transporter surface expression (see Table 1). The dopamine transporter \n(DAT) is localized to dopaminergic neurons where it functions to transport extracel-\nlular dopamine (DA) into DA neurons, leading to a termination of DA signaling. The \ndynamic nature of expression of DATs at the neuronal cell surface determines the \nduration and spatial limitation of dopaminergic neurotransmission. DAT activity, in \nturn, is regulated by endocytic trafficking. Large-scale RNAi experiments disrupting \nPKC-dependent endocytosis assays involving HA-tagged DAT (HA-DAT) in cul-\ntured rat neurons revealed that Nedd4-2, as well as adaptor proteins such as epsin, \nEps15, and Eps15R, are involved in modulating surface expression of DAT. RNAi \ndepletion of Nedd4-2 results in a dramatic reduction of PKC-dependent ubiquitina-\ntion of DAT (259). Furthermore, endogenous Nedd4-2, epsin, and Eps15 coim-\nmunoprecipitated with endogenous DAT isolated from rat striatum (259) indicating \ndirect interactions between DAT and the endocytic machinery. These data indicate \nthat PKC-induced ubiquitination of DAT is mediated by Nedd4-2, which leads to an \ninteraction of DAT with adaptor proteins in coated pits accelerating DAT endocytosis."}

Helton and M.D. Ehlers \n \n4.2.1 The UPS in Synaptic Plasticity  \nThe importance of the UPS in synaptic plasticity was first noted in behavioral condi-\ntioning studies of Aplysia (28, 58, 194). During long-term facilitation (LTF), a para-\ndigm similar to LTP, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity continues even \nafter cAMP levels return to baseline concentrations (105). In the absence of cAMP, \ninactivated PKA exists as a holoenzyme consisting of two catalytic subunits whose \nactivity is suppressed by a dimeric regulatory subunit. As cAMP concentrations \nincrease, four cAMP molecules interact with the regulatory dimer, releasing the \nconstitutively active catalytic subunits (see chapter by Hell and Strack, this volume). \nWhen cAMP levels return to baseline, the holoenzyme reforms, inactivating PKA \ncatalytic activity. During LTF, PKA activation is accompanied by UPS degradation \nof its regulatory subunits, leading to persistent PKA activity without elevated cAMP \nlevels (42, 90, 196, 231). Intriguingly, ubiquitin recycling also increases during LTF \nfurther enhancing degradative events. Specifically, the level of Aplysia ubiquitin C-\nterminal hydrolase Ap-uch, an ortholog of mammalian UCH-L1, is increased follow-\ning the induction of LTF leading to amplified disassembly of polyubiquitin chains \nand thus a larger free pool of ubiquitin (Table 1, Fig. 4) (105, 106). \nProtein degradation by the UPS is also important for the generation of short-\nterm and long-term memory in concert with protein synthesis. For example, the well-\ndefined odor-shock learning paradigm in Drosophila involves an increase in the \nexpression of genes involved in mRNA transport as well as local translation (277). \nThese events are regulated by components of the RNA interference (RISC) pathway. \nIn particular, armitage, a component of the RISC pathway, inversely regulates synaptic \nCaMKII expression in Drosophila in response to synaptic activity. As synaptic activ-\nity increases, armitage expression decreases, leading to increased expression of \nCaMKII and subsequent postsynaptic enhancement (54). Armitage itself is targeted \nfor degradation by the UPS (Fig. 4). In Drosophila brain, activity-dependent loss of \narmitage was prevented by a dominant-negative mutant of the proteasome β-subunit \n(DTS5) (8). Furthermore, incubation with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin \nblocked nicotine-induced loss of GFP:Armi during periods of increased neuronal \nactivity associated with memory (8).  \nAlthough it has been well documented that long-term changes in synaptic effi-\ncacy rely on protein synthesis, recent evidence indicates an equally important role for \nprotein degradation in establishing late-phase LTP at hippocampal synapses. Both \nearly and late phases of LTP induced by high-frequency stimulation are reduced at \nSchaeffer collateral CA1 synapses after the application of proteasome inhibitors (83, \n136). Interestingly, coapplication of protein synthesis inhibitors along with protea-\nsome inhibitors largely restores late LTP (83), indicating a delicate balance of pro-\nduction and destruction of plasticity-associated proteins. The precise identity of these \nplasticity-associated proteins remains to be discovered. \nWhile the majority of UPS components and targets involved in LTP/LTD are \nnot yet known, the HECT domain E3 ligase Ube3a/E6-AP has been shown to regu-\nlate synaptic plasticity.

Despite its biochemical stability, the PSD \nundergoes structural changes in response to alterations in synaptic activity (68, 69, \n88, 104, 188, 202, 207, 211, 275). Long-term time-lapse imaging has revealed con-\ntinuous turnover and remodeling of the PSD structural protein PSD-95 at excitatory \nsynapses. In addition, fluorescence photobleaching experiments have revealed sig-\nnificant ongoing exchange of PSD proteins (97, 250, 276). Biochemical pulse-chase \nexperiments have demonstrated that the aggregate turnover rate of PSD-associated \nproteins is on the order of hours (69). Evidence now indicates that these dynamic \nmolecular changes are at least partially mediated by the UPS.  \nBiochemically isolated PSD fractions have long been known to be rich in ubiq-\nuitin-immunopositive components (43). Recent studies show that altering the amount \nof neuronal activity causes reciprocal changes in global protein composition of the \nPSD (Fig. 6) (69). Correlating with these protein compositional changes, decreasing \nsynaptic activity diminishes ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in the PSD and decreases \nprotein turnover, whereas increasing synaptic activity increases ubiquitin conjugation \nand accelerates protein turnover (Fig. 6) (69). These results indicate that the rate of \npostsynaptic protein turnover is tightly tuned by synaptic activity during molecular \nremodeling.  \nTo date, few PSD-associated proteins have been shown to be directly ubiquiti-\nnated. However, among the known targets of ubiquitination are major PSD scaffold \nproteins including Shank, GKAP/SAPAP, AKAP79/150, and PSD-95 (51, 69).

This inhibition is due to the dominant effect of phos-\nphorylation at the inhibitory threonine 305 site and reduced postsynaptic localization \n(281, 293). One attractive possibility is that Ube3a positively regulates CaMKII \nactivity by degrading a yet to be determined negative regulator of a CaMKII phos-\nphatase.

While experiments have clearly demonstrated that glutamate receptors in \nC. elegans undergo direct ubiquitination (35), detecting ubiquitination of mammalian \nglutamate receptors has been more elusive. In this section, we will highlight key \nexperiments involving glutamate receptor trafficking in both C. elegans and mam-\nmals and point out possible mechanistic differences between the two systems. We \nwill also discuss the UPS-dependent effects on trafficking of GABAA and nicotinic \nacetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in mammals. \n4.3.1 Glutamate Receptor Regulation in C. elegans  \nUbiquitination of the GLR-1 glutamate receptor at C. elegans synapses causes recep-\ntor elimination from the postsynaptic membrane through an endocytotic mechanism \ninvolving the clathrin adaptor protein AP180 (35). While seemingly unrelated, APC \nloss-of-function mutants exhibit locomotor deficits that correspond to increases in \npostsynaptic levels of GLR-1 and synapse size (Table 1) (134). This is similar to the \nfindings that Drosophila APC mutants have enlarged synapses, increased postsynap-\ntic glutamate receptor clustering, and deficits in synaptic transmission at the neuro-\nmuscular synapse (280). Although GLR-1 has not been shown to be a direct sub-\nstrate of the APC, the APC loss-of-function phenotype is suppressed by loss of \nfunction of the unc-11/AP180 clathrin adaptor, indicating that APC activity is linked \nto the endocytotic pathway (134). The APC has not been localized to the synapse, \nalthough in Drosophila, the APC controls presynaptic size via liprin-α (280), which \nis known to organize the presynaptic active zone and regulate neurotransmitter re-\nlease (Fig. 4). \nIn a previous section, we noted that LIN-23 is important in axonal outgrowth \n(193). Recent genetic experiments have also shown that LIN-23 is a negative regula-\ntor of synaptic GLR-1 levels in the ventral nerve cord of C. elegans (Table 1) (66). \nLIN-23 shares sequence similarity to the mammalian F-box protein β-TrCP, a key \ncomponent of the Wnt signaling pathway. During Wnt signaling, β-catenin binds to \nthe TCF/Lef family of transcription factors, thereby upregulating the expression of \nWnt target genes (17, 122). Low levels of Wnt expression cause β-catenin to associ-\nate with a destruction complex where β-catenin is phosphorylated by glycogen syn-\nthase kinase-3β. Phosphorylated β-catenin is then recognized by β-TrCP and tar-\ngeted for proteasomal degradation (165, 220, 301, 309). Similar to the function of β-\nTrCP in mammalian cells, SCFLIN-23 targets the C. elegans β-catenin ortholog BAR-1 \nfor degradation (66). The effects of loss-of-function mutants of LIN-23 on GLR-1 \nclustering are rescued by an unc-11/AP180 loss of function mutant, suggesting that \nSCFLIN-23 promotes GLR-1 endocytosis. The receptor clustering phenotype in LIN-\n23 knockout animals can be partially rescued by loss of function of the TCF/Lef \nhomolog POP-1. This indicates that GLR-1 is also a target gene of Wnt signaling \n(66) and SCFLIN-23 negatively regulates GLR-1 expression through both the endo-\ncytic pathway and gene transcription."}
{"text": "===== Page 26 =====\n578 \nT.D. Helton and M.D. Ehlers \n \nAnother UPS protein shown to interact with GLR-1 is KEL-8. KEL-8 is a broad \ncomplex tramtrack bric-a-brac (BTB)-Kelch protein that directly associates with \nCUL-3, a scaffold component of cullin-RING family E3 ligases (224), imparting \nsubstrate specificity to the E3 ligase. KEL-8 localizes to sites adjacent to GLR-1 \npostsynaptic clusters along ventral cord neurites, and KEL-8 mutant worms show an \nincreased frequency of spontaneous reversal in locomotion indicative of changes in \nGLR-1 levels at synapses (245). Indeed, mutations in KEL-8 lead to increases in \nGLR-1 levels at postsynaptic clusters, while the levels and localization of other post-\nsynaptic proteins are unaltered (245). These results show that KEL-8 is involved in \nubiquitin-mediated turnover of GLR-1 subunits, and that cullin-3 ubiquitin ligases \nare required for the turnover of GLR-1 receptors. \n4.3.2 The UPS and Glutamate Receptor Regulation at Mammalian Synapses  \nOne of the primary determinants of excitatory synaptic strength is the number of \nAMPA receptors expressed at the postsynaptic surface (see chapter by Esteban, this \nvolume). AMPA receptors are endocytosed and sorted into various recycling or degra-\ndative pathways in an activity-dependent fashion. Under conditions of minimal synap-\ntic activity, AMPA receptors in hippocampal cultures undergo endocytosis in as little \nas 14 min. However, during periods of increased neuronal activity, AMPA receptor \nendocytosis is accelerated by threefold (70). AMPA receptor internalization can also be \ntriggered by direct ligand binding or by NMDA or insulin receptor activation (15, 31, \n41, 70, 175, 183). While both direct and indirect activation can initiate AMPA receptor \ninternalization, the fate of the endocytosed receptors depends on the nature of the stim-\nuli. Activation of AMPA receptors alone directs receptors to be sorted for degradation \nwhile NMDA receptor activation alone leads to AMPA receptor recycling (70, 169).  \nUnlike C. elegans GLR-1 receptors, which undergo direct ubiquitination (35), \nmammalian AMPA receptors can be internalized indirectly through ubiquitination of \nthe postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 by the RING domain ubiquitin ligase \nMdm2 (Table 1, Fig. 4) (51). In hippocampal neurons, NMDA-dependent PSD-95 \nubiquitination is inhibited in the absence of Ca2+ or in the presence of the calcineurin \ninhibitor ascomycin, (51) suggesting that Mdm2 and calcineurin function in the same \npathway with calcineurin operating upstream of Mdm2. Furthermore, overexpression \nof a ubiquitin mutant that allows monoubiquitnation, but not polyubiquitination, \nprevents AMPA-induced receptor endocytosis (219). While it has been shown that \nchanges in PSD-95 levels can modulate synaptic AMPA receptor content (71-73, \n266), PSD-95 ubiquitination is not always detectable (21, 69). This may result from a \ntight regulation of PSD-95 ubiquitination or de-ubiquitination.  \nThe degradation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors is also regulated by the \nUPS. The F-box protein Fbx2, an SCF complex component, mediates activity-\ndependent ubiquitination and degradation of NMDA receptor NR1 subunits by  \nrecognizing high mannose glycans in the N-terminal extracellular domain of NR1 \n(Table 1, Fig. 4) (137). Such high mannose modifications are typically present on \nproteins trafficking through early stages of the secretory pathway including the en-\ndoplasmic reticulum and cis-Golgi apparatus (107) (see chapter by Hanus and \nEhlers, this volume). In neurons, Fbx2 localizes to dendritic spines, and expression"}
{"text": "===== Page 27 =====\nUbiquitin and Protein Degradation in Synapse Function\n579\n \n \nof a dominant-negative form of Fbx2 leads to an increase in surface NMDA receptor \nexpression (137), suggesting that ongoing ubiquitination of NR1 by Fbx2 in intracel-\nlular compartments limits or interrupts forward trafficking.  \nIn a manner similar to ubiquitination, posttranslational modification of proteins \nby the small ubiquitin-like modifier protein (SUMO) alters protein trafficking and \nfunction. Although best known for its role in signaling within the nucleus, SUMOy-\nlation occurs at the synapse, with one key target being the kainate-type glutamate \nreceptor GluR6 (189). SUMOylation of GluR6 is increased in response to kainate \nand regulates endocytosis of the receptor. Correspondingly, kainate receptor-\nmediated postsynaptic currents in hippocampal slices are bidirectionally regulated by \nSUMOylation and deSUMOylation (189). In addition to SUMOylation, GluR6 is \nubiquitinated and binds actinfilin, a synaptic BTB-Kelch protein that acts as an adap-\ntor for a Cul3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (242) in a manner surprisingly similar to \nthe C. elegans GLR-1 receptor (245). Surface levels of GluR6 vary inversely with \nlevels of actinfilin, suggesting that the actinfilin-Cul3 complex targets kainate recep-\ntors for membrane removal and/or degradation (242). \n4.3.3 Trafficking of GABAA and Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors  \nWhile glutamatergic receptors are the primary determinants of excitatory synaptic \nstrength, GABAA receptors mediate rapid inhibitory synaptic transmission (see chapter \nby Lorena Arancibia-Carcamo et al., this issue). Certain GABAA receptor α- and β-\nsubunits have been shown to interact with protein linking IAP to cytoplasmic 1 (Plic-\n1), an adaptor protein with an N-terminal UBL domain and a C-terminal UBA domain \n(Fig. 4) (16). In neurons, Plic-1 colocalizes with GABAA receptors by immunofluores-\ncent imaging while electron microscopy shows Plic-1 in proximity to GABAA recep-\ntors (16). Disruption of the Plic-1/GABAA receptor interaction reduces GABAA recep-\ntor surface expression levels by 20%, indicating that Plic-1 enhances receptor \nexpression at the plasma membrane (16). Pulse-chase experiments in the presence of \nthe proteasome inhibitor lactacystin showed a 30% increase in the stability of recombi-\nnant β3-containing GABAA receptors when coexpressed with Plic-1, indicating that \nGABAA subunit turnover is sensitive to proteasome inhibition (16). These results indi-\ncate that the Plic-1 UBA domain may bind monoubiquitinated GABAA receptors pre-\nventing polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the receptor. \n5 The Ubiquitin–Proteasome System in Neurological Disease \nA shared characteristic of several prevalent neurodegenerative disorders such as \nParkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Huntington’s disease (HD), \nand amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the presence of ubiquitin-positive intracel-\nlular inclusions (179, 180, 238, 254). The significance of ubiquitin-rich aggregates \nassociated with the onset of these neurological disorders is not well understood. \nUbiquitin-conjugated protein aggregation may be a mechanism for coping with the \nbuildup of dysfunctional proteins or a direct consequence of the disorder itself. As \nmore information points to the UPS as an important regulator of synapse develop-"}

Helton and M.D. Ehlers \n \nment and function, the question naturally arises as to whether aberrant UPS function \ncould lead to neurological disease by impaired synapse regulation and plasticity \n(238). Furthermore, mutations in UPS-linked genes have been shown to contribute to \nthe etiology of heritable forms of neurodegenerative disorders such as familial Park-\ninson’s disease and neurodevelopmental diseases such as Angelman syndrome \nwhose underlying pathogenesis may involve synaptic dysfunction. \n5.1 Dysregulation of the UPS in Parkinson’s Disease \nParkinson’s disease (PD) is a movement disorder resulting from a gradual degenera-\ntion of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Approximately 1% of the popu-\nlation older than 65 years is affected, of which only 5% of reported cases possess an \ninherited component (27). To date, several genes have been linked to the rare, inher-\nited forms of PD, and the identification of these genes has generated important clues \ninto the mechanisms underlying an otherwise mysterious disease. Proteins encoded \nby PARK genes include α-synuclein (PARK1) (230), parkin (PARK2, Table 1) \n(150), UCH-L1 (PARK5) (171), phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chro-\nmosome 10-induced kinase 1 or PINK-1 (PARK6) (279), DJ-1 (PARK7) (24), and \nleucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (PARK8) (215). In this chapter, we focus on the role of \nparkin (PARK2) and its role in the etiology of familial PD. \n5.1.1 Parkin  \nParkin is a member of the RING class of E3 ligases. Structurally, parkin has a C-\nterminal PDZ-binding domain (80) and a modified C-terminal in-between (IBR) RING \ndomain flanked by two RING motifs. The N-terminus of parkin has a UBL domain \nthat binds the Rpn10 subunit of the proteasome and is thought to aid the shuttling of \nubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome for degradation (241). Numerous mutations \nspanning the entire parkin gene result in PD phenotypes with detectable symptoms \nmanifesting before the age of 30 (59). Interestingly, patients with PD-linked parkin \nmutations lack the accumulation of Lewy bodies commonly seen in patients with spo-\nradic forms of the disease, suggesting that Lewy body deposits are not solely responsi-\nble for PD. One possibility is that parkin activity may be involved in the conjugation of \nubiquitin to Lewy body components as evidenced by ubiquitinated forms of putative \nparkin substrates α-synuclein (255), synphilin (46), and parkin itself (45, 313), all of \nwhich have been shown to be present in Lewy bodies (27, 171).  \nParkin likely has diverse cellular roles as it localizes to both presynaptic and \npostsynaptic structures, including synaptic vesicles and dendritic vesicles as well as \nglial cell bodies (197). Parkin interacts with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 core \ncomponents of the postsynaptic density at glutamatergic synapses indicating a poten-\ntial role in postsynaptic function (80). Consistent with a role in synaptic transmis-\nsion, parkin null mice show subtle behavioral deficits and altered excitability in the \nhippocampus and striatum (96, 126, 286). The diversity of disease-linked parkin \nmutations can lead to widely varying effects on E3 ligase activity, localization, and \nsubstrate binding (190, 262). While PD linked to parkin mutations most commonly \nfollow a recessive inheritance trend, disease-linked mutations may lead to disruption"}
{"text": "===== Page 29 =====\nUbiquitin and Protein Degradation in Synapse Function\n581\n \n \nor enhancement of parkin function (243, 262, 291), indicating the cellular effects of \nparkin mutations may not be simply due to loss of protein function.  \nOf the many possible roles parkin may play in neuronal function, one common \ntheme is neuroprotection. Levels of the parkin substrate cyclin E, a positive regulator \nof neuronal apoptosis (263), is increased in patients with parkin-linked PD. Overex-\npression of wild-type parkin in cultured neurons causes a reduction in cyclin E levels \nand a greater resistance to excitotoxic insult (263). Furthermore, excitotoxicity \nlinked to overexpression of the parkin substrates α-synuclein and the Pael-1 receptor \nis reduced by coexpression of wild-type parkin (124, 225, 307). Through its N-\nterminal UBL domain, parkin also interacts with the UIM-containing adaptor protein \nEps15, and thereby regulates the internalization and trafficking of the epidermal \ngrowth factor receptor (EGFR) (53, 79). Eps15 is monoubiquitinated in the presence \nof EGF in a parkin-dependent manner reducing its binding to EGF receptors (79, \n195). Correspondingly, RNAi-mediated parkin knockdown increases the internaliza-\ntion of EGF indicating that endogenous parkin prevents Eps15-dependent EGF re-\nceptor endocytosis (79). Interestingly, EGF receptor activation protects dopaminer-\ngic neurons (79), and EGFR expression is decreased in the striata of patients with PD \n(128). Moreover, EGFR signaling activates the downstream kinase Akt (79), which \nis well known to mediate neuronal survival (67, 77, 138, 157, 226). These results \nsuggest that the neuroprotective effect of parkin may arise from its ability to increase \nthe cellular response to EGF through an Akt-dependent pathway. \nA complication in studying the function of parkin in normal neuronal physiol-\nogy or in PD pathways is that few putative parkin substrates show elevated expres-\nsion levels in parkin null mice. Also, these parkin knockout mice do not exhibit \ndopaminergic neurodegeration (96, 98, 153, 221) further clouding the link between \nparkin function and disease phenotypes (284). One recent important clue in this \nregard is that dopamine itself covalently modifies parkin inactivating its ubiquitin \nligase activity (166), suggesting a link to the progressive and selective loss of parkin \nactivity in dopaminergic neurons during sporadic Parkinson’s disease. \n5.1.2 Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Angelman Syndrome  \nAngelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe \nlearning disabilities, ataxia, limited speech, inappropriate laughter, and seizures with \nno apparent neurodegeneration or gross brain morphology defects (297). Approxi-\nmately 70% of cases of AS are caused by characteristic disruptions in the maternal \nchromosome 15q11-q13, leading to a microdeletion of chromosomal DNA (152). \nThis deleted region contains genes for the GABAA receptor β3 subunit (GABRB3) \nand Ube3a, which encodes a HECT domain E3 ubiquitin ligase generally accepted to \nbe the primary genetic cause of AS (Table 1, Fig. 4) (147, 191, 247). Indeed, in some \npatients with AS, the genetic etiology is a point mutation or small deletion within the \nmaternal Ube3a allele (3, 55, 147). Ube3a is selectively imprinted in the brain where \nexpression occurs only from the maternal allele. Ube3a expression shows a stereo-\ntypical pattern of imprinting in most brain regions. For example, the maternal copy \nof Ube3a is highly expressed in hippocampal neurons and Purkinje cells of the cere-\nbellum while the paternal copy in these regions is not (3, 236, 288). Heterozygous"}

Even though a large number of protein components comprising the \nUPS have been identified, few have been studied in great detail at synapses.

These animals show defects in hippocampal LTP, con-\ntext-dependent learning, mild motor dysfunction, and a susceptibility to audiogeni-\ncally induced seizures (130). \nWhile the genetic component of AS has been identified, the precise physiologi-\ncal role of Ube3a function has not. Recent studies indicate that Ube3a regulates the \nactivity of CamKIIα. Heterozygous mice lacking the maternal Ube3a allele (Ube3a \nm–/p+) show increased CaMKII phosphorylation on threonines 286 and 305 in hip-\npocampal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells (281, 293). As mentioned in previous \nsections, inhibitory phosphorylation of CaMKII is predicted to have a significant \nimpact on synaptic plasticity and transmission (50, 281, 293). Synaptic dysfunction \nhas been proposed as a general mechanism for neurodevelopmental disorders (317), \nwhich in the case of AS points to the involvement of the UPS. \nThe emerging importance of protein turnover at synapses raises interesting ques-\ntions about how neurons maintain their synaptic integrity. What determines synaptic \nprotein turnover? What determines replacement of specific proteins and how are they \nreplaced? How is protein degradation coupled to protein synthesis? How is synapse \nstructure preserved? Are there degradation pathways for synaptic proteins relevant to \nsynaptic plasticity similar to pathways postulated for synaptic protein synthesis? \nAlso, a central theory of learning-based synaptic plasticity is that information is \nsomehow stored by the composition of proteins at synapses. During ongoing activ-\nity-dependent protein turnover, how does the synapse sustain its molecular memory? \nWhile stimulating questions still remain, the multiple roles of the UPS in synapse \ndevelopment, signaling, and plasticity promise to offer many avenues for future \nstudy. Such efforts may be crucial in determining the link between normal synaptic \nphysiology and dysfunction in neurological disorders involving aberrant protein \ndegradation by the UPS."}

Martin \nDepartment of Biological Chemistry and Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral  \nSciences, Brain Research Institute, Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, \nUCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA, kcmartin@mednet.ucla.edu \n \n1 Introduction \nNeurons, like all other eukaryotic cells, persistently alter their structure and/or func-\ntion in response to extracellular signals through stimulus-induced changes in gene \nexpression. While signal transduction pathways that serve to convey signals from the \nplasma membrane to the nucleus have been well characterized in non-neuronal cells, \nthe transduction of signals from cell surface to nucleus poses a unique set of chal-\nlenges in neurons because the distances between the sites receiving the signal and the \nnucleus can be extremely large (Fig. 1). The polarized morphology of nerve cells, \nwith processes extending distances that can exceed the diameter of the cell body by \norders of magnitude, has thus necessitated the development of specialized mecha-\nnisms for retrograde transport of information received at the cell surface to the soma. \n \nLong-distance retrograde transport of signals is essential to the survival, growth \nand adaptability of neurons in the developing and the adult nervous system. During \ndevelopment, signals are transported from distal growth cones to the nucleus while \nneurons change their transcriptional profiles as axonal growth cones navigate and \ncontact potential synaptic partners (41). In the adult brain, long-lasting forms of \nsynaptic plasticity, including those that underlie learning and memory, depend on \nnew transcription, indicating that stimuli received at synaptic sites are relayed to the \nnucleus to alter gene expression (2, 42). Retrograde signaling from distal sites also \noccurs in mature neurons following axonal injury, when injury-induced signals are \ntransported to the nucleus to trigger transcription-dependent axonal regeneration (28, \n61). During each of these processes, signals received at distal compartments elicit \ntranscriptional changes in the nucleus. While many studies have identified genes \nwhose expression is altered by specific stimuli, the mechanisms whereby signals are \ntransduced from the site of stimulation to the nucleus are just beginning to be eluci-\ndated. \nJ.W.

Section 1 \nintroduces the synapse. Section 2 describes the structure and composition of pre-\nsynaptic axons. Section 3 elucidates postsynaptic structure and composition. Section 4\ndiscusses the impact of perisynaptic astroglial processes on synapses. Throughout \nall sections an effort is made to understand regularities in the relationships among \nthese features that might contribute to the diversity in synapse size and number in \nsystematic ways. \nA synapse has a presynaptic component, usually an axon but sometimes a den-\ndrite, and a postsynaptic component, usually part of a dendrite, cell soma, or axonal \ninitial segment and occasionally an astroglial process. Perisynaptic astroglia repre-\nsent a third component that occurs at some synapses. When perisynaptic astroglia are \npresent, the structural complex has been referred to as a ‘tripartite synapse’ (45). Figure 1 \nillustrates an electron micrograph of an ultrathin (50 nm) section through dendrites, \naxons, astroglial processes an synapses in the rat hippocampus. This picture was \nchosen to open this chapter because it nicely illustrates the diversity in the composi-\ntion of even a tiny segment of the neuropil."}

{"text": "===== Page 4 =====\n4 \nK.M. Harris \n \n2.1 Presynaptic Active Zone \nA presynaptic axonal bouton contains vesicles with a variety of shapes and sizes. \nThese vesicles contain excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters, neuromodulatory \npeptides, proteins required to concentrate neurotransmitters, and a variety of proteins \ninvolved in the vesicle cycle or that are destined for the presynaptic active zone (11). \nThe presynaptic active zone is a specialized region variously described as ‘dense \nprojections’, the ‘presynaptic grid’ or mini-active zones (34) where vesicles dock \nand become ready for release. Presynaptic vesicles are arranged along filaments that \nappear to be connected to the presynaptic active zone area (20, 25).  \n2.2 Presynaptic Vesicles – Excitatory Synapses \nExcitatory presynaptic boutons contain clear round vesicles, approximately 35–50 \nnm in diameter (Fig. 3). These vesicles usually contain the neurotransmitter gluta-\nmate. Vesicles docked at the active zones are thought to be ready for release and \nvesicles located away from the membrane are thought to be in a pool that can be \nrecruited for later release. One mechanism for neurotransmitter release involves pore \nformation and subsequent collapse of the presynaptic vesicle into the presynaptic \nmembrane at the active zone with the contents being released into the synaptic cleft. \nFollowing exocytosis, synaptic vesicle membrane and protein constituents are recy-\ncled through endocytosis (see chapter by McPherson et al., this volume). Endocyto-\nsis typically occurs distant from the active zone, and is characterized morphologi-\ncally by the presence of clathrin coated pits, vesicles and tubular compartments with \ncoated buds that give rise to new synaptic vesicles locally in the presynaptic bouton \n(e.g. Fig. 3g). \nSorting endosomal complexes also have a multivesicular body (similar to that \nshown in Fig. 12d for dendrites below) or a primary lysosome that transports pro-\nteins and membrane bound for degradation away from the axonal bouton back to the \nsoma. Presynaptic vesicles can also be rapidly recycled through a ‘kiss-and-run’ \nmechanism. During kiss-and-run, the vesicles release a portion of their contents \nthrough the pore, without collapse of the vesicular membrane.

Inhibitory synapses are most \nabundant at the neuronal soma (Fig. 4a) and proximal dendritic zones (see chapter by \nArancibia-Carcamo, Triller and Kittler, this volume). In addition, inhibitory synapses \ncan be interspersed among excitatory synapses (in the hippocampus about 1 inhibitory \nper 10–20 excitatory synapses) along a dendrite (Fig. 4b). Occasionally, inhibitory \nsynapses are located at the axonal hillock, where activation of one or a small number of \ninhibitory synapses can regulate neuronal cell firing at their axons.

Harris \n \n2.5 Local Protein Synthesis in Presynaptic Boutons? \nAlthough polyribosomes are not a prominent component of presynaptic axonal  \nboutons in the central nervous system, mRNAs have been localized to them (32). In \nsquid giant axons, local protein synthesis machinery appears to derive from the en-\nsheathing glia (9, 14). Detailed three-dimensional reconstructions will be required to \nlearn whether isolated polyribosomes are directed into vertebrate presynaptic axonal \nboutons to allow for local protein synthesis, similar to that observed in dendritic \nspines (see below). \n2.6 Nonsynaptic, Single Synaptic and Multisynaptic Axonal Boutons \nAxonal boutons containing clear synaptic vesicles, mitochondria, dense core vesi-\ncles, and multivesicular bodies occur both with and without postsynaptic partners \n(Fig. 6). In the mature hippocampus, about 96% of the vesicle-containing boutons \nhave at least one postsynaptic partner. Single-synapse boutons predominate compris-\ning about 75% of all vesicle-containing axonal boutons. About 21% of vesicle-\ncontaining boutons are multi-synaptic while about 4% are non-synaptic boutons in \nthe mature hippocampus (36, 37). There are more multisynaptic boutons when rapid \nsynaptogenesis occurs in the hippocampus, such as that which occurs during the \nestrus cycle (49) or following the preparation of mature hippocampal slices under \nice-cold conditions (22, 23, 31). Multisynaptic dendritic spines, receiving input from \nmore than one presynaptic axon occur relatively frequently during development and \nunder conditions of synaptogenesis in the mature hippocampus. The axonal segment \nin Fig. 6c was from a hippocampal slice that had been prepared under ice-cold dis-\nsection conditions, which induces new synapses. These findings suggest that rapid \nsynaptogenesis in the mature hippocampus does not require de novo formation of \npresynaptic axons. It is not known whether the nonsynaptic boutons also constitute a \nsource of available presynaptic boutons to accommodate rapid synaptogenesis, if \nthey represent vesicle clusters in transit between presynaptic varicosities, or if thery \nare sites of recent synapse loss. Similarly, presynaptic axonal boutons vary in struc-\nture along the axons from other brain regions such as cerebellar cortex (Fig. 7, (48)). \nParallel fiber axons synapse with dendritic spines of Purkinje cell spiny branchlets \n(Fig. 7a–c; see also Figs. 8d, 11c and f below for further discussion of these postsy-\nnaptic spines).

For example, neighboring dendritic spines on \na single hippocampal dendritic segment can vary more than 10 fold in their dimen-\nsions (e.g. Figs. 2b, 11d). Large highly branched dendritic spines are the postsynaptic \npartners of mossy fibers in the hippocampal area CA3 (Fig. 8a–c). The dendritic \nspines occurring along the spiny branchlets of cerebellar Purkinje cells vary widely \nin their size, yet they are more uniformly club-shaped (Fig. 8d). These cerebellar \nspines can be branched; however, the head of each branch on the spine is also club \nshaped (for more examples see (17)). Similarly, dendritic spines distributed along the \nsame presynaptic axon vary greatly in their dimensions (Fig. 6). The size of the den-\ndritic spine and its synapse correlates nearly perfectly with the number of vesicles in \nthe presynaptic bouton for all brain regions tested so far (Fig. 9). Thus, it is of great \ninterest to understand the rules that govern local changes in synaptic structure and \nhow they are coordinated between the pre- and postsynaptic structures. One strategy \nhas been to investigate the impact of altering the molecular composition of neurons \nto determine the impact on dendritic spine structure (reviewed in (4, 42)).

The diver-\nsity in molecular composition from synapse to synapse is great, with hundreds of \ndifferent proteins having been identified in the PSD. In aldehyde-fixed tissue, excita-\ntory synapses are characterized by a thick PSD relative to the thinner presynaptic \nactive zone, and hence are called ‘asymmetric synapses’ (Figs. 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, \n14, see also (15, 30)). Inhibitory synapses usually have equally thin PSDs and pre-\nsynaptic active zones and hence are referred to as ‘symmetric synapses’ (Fig. 4). \nThese relationships are highly diverse and the degree of pre- and postsynaptic thick-\nening varies greatly even among excitatory or inhibitory synapses in the same brain \nregion ((6), http://synapses.clm.utexas.edu/anatomy/chemical/colh.htm).

Harris \n \n3.4 Diversity in Composition of Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum  \nand Endosomal Compartments in Dendrites and Spines \nSome dendritic spines contain smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), which func-\ntions as an internal calcium store. In the hippocampus, only about 15% of all spines \ncontain SER, and typically only the largest spines contain SER (40). In contrast, \nnearly all cerebellar dendritic spines contain SER (17). The spine apparatus is an \nenigmatic organelle variously thought to be involved in the regulation of calcium, \nsynthesis of proteins, and post-translational modification of proteins like the Golgi \napparatus (Fig. 11a–d). It contains SER-like membranes arranged in laminae sepa-\nrated by dense-staining bars that contain the actin-binding protein synaptopodin \nwhich is necessary for maintaining its laminar structure and for positioning it into \nspines (13). Only large hippocampal and cortical spines contain a spine apparatus; in \ncontrast the SER of cerebellar spines forms a reticular membranous network without \nthe dense-staining laminations found in the spine apparatus (Fig. 11ef). Total spine \nvolume is well-correlated with the volume of SER, suggesting a functional role in \nmaintaining ionic balance of cerebellar spines. The presence or absence of SER \nmight also account for the relative stability of cerebellar spines, and plasticity among \nhippocampal spines (3).  \nThere are many other membrane-bound organelles present in dendrites and \nspines.

{"text": "===== Page 19 =====\nDiversity in Synapse Structure and Composition\n19\n \n \n \nSummary \nIn this chapter I have described the highly diverse structure and composition of pre-\nsynaptic axons, postsynaptic spines and dendrites, and perisynaptic astroglial proc-\nesses. Postsynaptic size is proportional to presynaptic vesicle content and larger \nsynaptic dendritic spines contain more of the subcellular organelles needed to re-\nmodel and sustain them. Perisynaptic astroglial processes also appear to be key play-\ners in determining synapse size. Although synapse structure may appear static in \nelectron micrographs, it is highly dynamic, undergoing dramatic changes in gross \nmorphology, as well as, the positioning of subcellular organelles during basic synap-\ntic transmission and in response to conditions that elicit changes in synapse function \nor ‘synaptic plasticity’. Similarly, the structure and composition of synapses can vary \nacross brain regions, and change dynamically during development, maturation, nor-\nmal aging, neurological disorders and trauma. Careful consideration of this structural \ndiversity and plasticity is leading to new understanding about synapse formation, \ngrowth, maintenance and elimination. \n \nThis differential arrangement of perisynaptic astroglia suggests that some syn-\napses are highly regulated and supported by this important partner in the tripartite \nsynapse, whereas other synapses are either more selective, unable to attract astroglial \nprocesses, or actively repel them (44). Exactly how this relationship is regulated by \nlocal synaptic plasticity remains to be determined, however, attraction to high concen-\ntrations of extracellular glutamate is a likely candidate mechanism (8). In the mature \nhippocampus, those synapses that have a perisynaptic astroglial process at its perime-\nter, are on average significantly larger than synapses without (47). Importantly, size is \nassociated with the presence of an astroglial process juxtaposed to the postsynaptic \nspine and/or synaptic cleft; not the degree to which the astroglial process surrounds \nthe synapse (Fig. 14de). In fact, very large hippocampal synapses might have only a \nsmall fraction of their perimeters surrounded by an astroglial process (compare Fig. \n14de). These arrangements suggest that the perisynaptic astroglial processes do more \nthan simply delineate boundaries between synapses to prevent spillover of neuro-\ntransmitter and crosstalk and are likely crucial partners in sustaining synapses (2). \nOne intriguing possibility, small, new, relatively unstable synapses in hippocampus or \ncortex, share the extracellular products released during synaptic transmission from \nother synapses, until they grow big enough to attract their own stabilizing astroglial \nprocesses (see chapter by Eroglu, Barres and Stevens, this volume). \n \n \nReferences \n1. \nAhmari SE, Smith SJ.

Martin \n \nspread, action potentials or calcium spikes to the cell soma, where the opening of \nvoltage-gated calcium channels in the plasma membrane rapidly transmits signals to \nthe nucleus (8, 18, 24, 66, 79, 80). Rapid signaling can also occur by regenerative \ncalcium waves mediated by inositol triphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs) and ryanodine \nreceptors (RYRs) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is continuous with the \nnuclear envelope yet extends into distal neuronal processes (12). Slower retrograde \nsignaling pathways include the passive or active transport of signaling molecules \n2 Rapid Synapse-Nucleus Signaling \n2.1 Signaling Mediated by Action Potentials \nElectrochemical signaling allows neurons to rapidly deliver signals from distal sites \nto the nucleus. Local depolarization of the synaptic terminal, mediated by ligand-\ngated ion channels, can activate voltage-gated ion channels. The influx of both so-\ndium and calcium ions further depolarizes the membrane, and if this depolarization \nreaches threshold at the axon hillock, it triggers action potentials, which depolarize \nthe soma and axon (and potentially into dendrites via backpropagating action poten-\ntials) (10). Synaptic potentials generated at distal dendritic sites can also be rapidly \nconveyed to the cell soma via forward-propagating dendritic spikes (80). Once they \nreach the soma, action potentials and dendritic spikes both result in the opening of \nvoltage-gated calcium channels, triggering a large increase in intracellular calcium. \nThe increase in somatic calcium can in turn activate calcium-sensitive signaling \ncascades that function to alter gene expression in the nucleus. Calcium-sensitive \nsignaling molecules can be activated directly within the nucleus via increases in \nnuclear calcium concentrations, or they can be activated in the somatic cytoplasm \nand then imported into the nucleus. These signaling molecules activate transcription \nfactors and thereby couple neuronal activity to changes in gene expression (1, 8). \nWhether calcium-dependent signaling cascades are directly activated in the nu-\ncleus or in the somatic cytoplasm, action potential or spike-mediated signaling from \nsynapse to nucleus is extremely rapid. Electrochemical signals propagate along the \nlength of the neuron within milliseconds. The propagation of calcium transients to \nthe nucleus occurs within seconds, and the transport of signaling molecules (e.g. \nactivated kinases) from somatic cytoplasm to the nucleus occurs within minutes. As \nsuch, transcriptional changes that result from action potentials or dendritic spikes \ncould occur very quickly (within minutes) after a signal is received at the synapse.  \nthrough the axon and dendrite to the cell body (58) and the transport of signals from \ndistal compartments in the form of signaling endosomes (22, 33, 36). It is likely that \nneurons use a combination of these various signaling mechanisms to transmit infor-\nmation to the nucleus. In this manner, distinct stimuli can recruit specific retrograde \nsignaling pathways, and these in turn trigger distinct changes in transcriptional pro-\nfiles that are initiated and persist over various time domains. In this chapter, we \nintroduce each of the various cell biological pathways neurons can use to convey \ninformation received at distal sites to the nucleus."}
{"text": "===== Page 5 =====\nSignaling from Synapse to Nucleus\n605\n \n \n \n \nAn additional advantage of electrochemical signaling between synapse and nucleus \nis that an influx of calcium occurs in the cell body. This increases the likelihood that \na calcium-dependent intracellular signal will be efficiently conveyed to the nucleus, \nand not be diminished as it travels the entire length of the dendrite. As a result, the \namount of signal that reaches the nucleus will be significantly greater than it would \nbe if the signal were transported directly from the synapse. \nTwo other features of signaling to the nucleus via action potentials should be \nconsidered. First, signaling by action potentials spreads throughout the cell, and \nthereby can activate signaling cascades throughout the cell. As such, it has been \nproposed that action potentials are not “synapse to nucleus” signals, but rather \nglobal, cell-wide signals initiated by synaptic stimulation (1). Presumably, in order to \nmediate signaling underlying synapse-specific changes in function, the products of \ngene expression induced by action potentials must combine with local synaptic tags \nthat are generated by the initial synaptic stimulation (20, 51). Synaptic tags are local-\nized changes that persist at synapses following stimulation and that function together \nwith the products of gene expression to produce persistent changes in synaptic struc-\nture and function. In fact, any transcriptional process should be considered to be a \n“global,” cell-wide change, and likely needs to combine with a synaptic tag to have \nsynapse-specific effects. A second consideration about electrochemical signaling is \nthat to function as a mechanism mediating activity-dependent changes in gene ex-\npression, it is likely that a threshold number of action potentials or spikes occur \nwithin a certain time window in order to activate transcriptional changes, with dis-\ntinct patterns of activity triggering differential patterns of transcription. \n2.2 Signaling Via the Endoplasmic Reticulum \nRapid calcium-dependent signaling from synapse to nucleus can also occur via the \nER, a major internal store of calcium. In neurons, the ER is continuous with the \nnuclear membrane and extends into both axons and dendrites. Within the axon, soma \nand initial dendritic segment, electron microscopy studies reveal that the ER can \ncome into close proximity to the plasma membrane (for review see (12)). Within the \ndendrite, the ER extends into spines where it forms the spine apparatus (71). \nThe ER contains two types of receptors that function to release calcium from the \nER lumen into the cytosol: InsP3Rs (19) and RYRs (84). InsP3Rs are found through-\nout the ER, including in synapses and spines as well as in regions where the ER is in \nclose proximity to the plasma membrane. InsP3Rs are activated by inositol triphos-\nphate (IP3), a second messenger generated by activation of G-protein coupled recep-\ntors that are coupled to phospholipase C, such as metabotropic glutamate receptors at \nexcitatory synapses. Their activity is critically modulated by cytosolic calcium, such \nthat calcium release is significantly potentiated by increased concentrations of cyto-\nsolic calcium. This sensitivity to calcium allows InsP3Rs to function as calcium-\ninduced calcium release (CICR) channels.  Notably, recent studies have shown that \nInsP3Rs can also be activated in the absence of IP3, through the binding of a family of \ncalcium binding proteins (77, 83).  While RYRs are found primarily in the cell body, \nthey are also present at more distal sites and can colocalize with InsP3Rs. RYRs are \nactivated when cytosolic calcium concentrations are between 1-10 μM; binding of"}
{"text": "===== Page 6 =====\n606 \nC.L. Heusner and K.C. Martin \n \ncalcium to the RYR promotes release of calcium from the ER lumen into the cytosol \n(84). As such, RYRs also function as CICR channels. \nThe sensitivity of both InsP3Rs and RYRs to calcium underlies their ability to \ngenerate regenerative calcium waves. Thus, calcium released from the internal stores \nin the ER is capable of activating neighboring InsP3Rs or RYRs, allowing the signal \nto continue along the ER. Because the ER can extend to the most distal sites in axons \nand dendrites, yet is connected with the nuclear envelope, activation of neighboring \nreceptors provides a means for a continuous signal to be rapidly propagated all the \nway to the nucleus. Receptors located at synapses and/or near the plasma membrane \nare activated by calcium influx through plasma membrane receptors; calcium re-\nleased from internal stores then promotes propagation of a calcium wave from the \ninitial site of activation through the neuronal process, to the nuclear envelope (9, 12, \n56, 74). Release of calcium from the ER amplifies the effects of calcium influx \nthrough plasma membrane calcium channels. Michael Berridge (12) has thus pro-\nposed that the ER acts as a “neuron-within-a-neuron.” While the outer membrane \nresponds quickly to external stimuli through the opening of ligand-gated ion chan-\nnels and activation of G protein-coupled receptors, the ER responds to the internal \nsignals generated in response to external stimuli. \nThe influx of extracellular calcium through ion channels and calcium released \nfrom intracellular stores in the ER both cause an increase in calcium concentrations \nin the cell body. The increases in somatic calcium concentrations can in turn activate \ncalcium-dependent signaling cascades in the somatic cytoplasm and/or in the nu-\ncleus, both of which can ultimately trigger calcium-dependent changes in gene ex-\npression. While signaling from synapse to nucleus via regenerative calcium waves in \nthe ER is somewhat slower than electrochemical signals, since it depends on both \nmetabotropic and ionotropic receptors, it is nonetheless a rapid mechanism of con-\nveying signals from distal sites to the soma. Further, the regenerative nature of the \ncalcium waves in the ER indicates that the signal is not diminished as it travels from \nthe site of initiation to the soma. \n3 Physical Translocation of Signaling Molecules from Distal \nCompartments to the Nucleus \nThe physical translocation of molecules through the axon or dendrite to the cell soma \nprovides another mechanism whereby neurons can signal from distal compartments \nto the nucleus. This type of signaling includes the retrograde transport of specialized \norganelles known as signaling endosomes as well as transport of soluble molecules \nvia either passive or active diffusion. Transport of signals via these pathways is \nmuch slower than signaling by action potentials or by regenerative calcium waves in \nthe ER. As a result, the coupling between stimulation at a distal site and the tran-\nscriptional response is slower and may persist over a longer time period. Notably, \nunlike nuclear signaling by action potentials or regenerative calcium waves in the \nER, the physical translocation of molecules from distal sites to the nucleus does not \nnecessarily depend on calcium. This thus provides a mechanism whereby stimuli that \ndo not cause depolarization or calcium influx (e.g. some modulatory inputs or \ngrowth factors) can nonetheless elicit changes in gene expression."}
{"text": "===== Page 7 =====\nSignaling from Synapse to Nucleus\n607\n \n \n \n \nBefore considering specific aspects of retrograde transport via signaling en-\ndosomes or active nuclear import pathways, it is useful to briefly discuss the role of \nthe cytoskeleton and of motor proteins in the retrograde transport of molecules to the \nneuronal soma. The neuronal cytoskeleton includes microtubules, actin and interme-\ndiate filaments. In addition to their structural roles in neurons, microtubules and actin \nfilaments serve as tracks for the directed movements of molecules within neuronal \nprocesses (27, 47). Microtubules are particularly relevant to the transport of signals \nfrom distal synapses to the soma because they provide long-range tracks for trans-\nport. In axons, microtubules are uniformly oriented with the plus ends at the synapse \nand minus ends at the cell body. In dendrites, the polarity of microtubules with re-\nspect to the cell body is mixed. Active transport along microtubules is mediated by \nmolecular motors, of which there are two major classes: kinesin motor proteins, \nwhich generally transport from minus to plus ends of microtubules, and dynein mo-\ntor proteins, which transport from plus to minus ends of microtubules. In axons, \nanterograde transport from the cell body to the synapse thus occurs via plus-end-\ndirected kinesins and retrograde transport from the terminals to the soma occurs via \ndynein, and possibly minus-end-directed kinesins. The directionality of motor-\nprotein driven transport is less clear in dendrites because of the mixed polarity of \nmicrotubules, although microtubules in distal dendrites have their plus ends oriented \ndistally indicating that dynein is required for retrograde transport of cargoes from \nthese sites (68). \nA central question in the field of molecular motors concerns the specificity and \nregulation of motor-cargo binding (27). This question is relevant to signaling from \nsynapse to nucleus in neurons since the regulated binding of cargoes to specific mo-\ntors will have obvious effects on the directionality of transport in axons and/or den-\ndrites. Cargo binding to kinesins, either directly or through adaptor or scaffolding \nproteins relieves auto-inhibition of the N-terminal tail of the motor protein by C-\nterminal sequences, allowing the cargo-containing kinesin to travel along micro-\ntubules. Cargo binding to dynein is frequently mediated by a large dynein-binding \nprotein called dynactin (34). Recent studies have indicated that post-translational \nmodifications of tubulin can also influence transport in neurons by modulating the \nassociation of motor proteins with microtubules (14). Specifically, acetylation of \ntubulin has been shown to increase the association of kinesin-1 to microtubules and \nthe transport of c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting proteins (JIPs, a family of adap-\ntor proteins for kinesin cargoes) into distal neurites (64), and to increase the traffick-\ning of BDNF-containing vesicles along microtubules in neurons (17). Thus, transport \nalong microtubules in neuronal processes may be regulated by the initial binding of \ncargoes to molecular motors and by the binding of molecular motors to microtubules. \nThe latter may be specifically regulated by post-translational modifications of tubu-\nlin, which include acetylation, tyrosination and polyglutamylation (76). \n3.1 Retrograde Signaling by Signaling Endosomes \nOne way of transmitting information received at distal compartments to the soma is \nvia the signaling endosome pathway (22, 33, 36). In this pathway, ligand-bound \nreceptors are internalized and transported back to the cell body in signaling"}
{"text": "===== Page 8 =====\n608 \nC.L. Heusner and K.C. Martin \n \nendosomes, functioning as activated receptors as they travel to the soma. This proc-\ness has been best characterized in neurons in terms of the binding of nerve growth \nfactor (NGF) to the tyrosine kinase receptor TrkA at the axon terminal. Binding of \nNGF to TrkA receptors causes dimerization of the receptor and autophosphorylation \nof specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain. The binding of the ligand \nand subsequent phosphorylation leads to an “activated” ligand-receptor complex. \nThis entire complex can be internalized through an endocytotic pathway that travels \nalong microtubules in a dynein-dependent manner. The ligand-receptor complex \nserves as the message that is transported from the nerve terminal to the soma in a \n“signaling endosome.” In the soma, the ligand-bound receptor activates signaling \ncascades that are then transmitted into the nucleus where they can alter transcription. \nA proposed advantage of the signaling endosome pathway in neurons is that it is \n“regenerative,” in the sense that the ligand remains bound to the receptor and thus \ncontinuously recruits signaling cascades as it travels through the axon to the nucleus \n(37). Many of the experiments elucidating the signaling endosome pathway have \nbeen in compartmentalized chambers in which the cell bodies of sympathetic neurons \nare separated from their axons by barriers, a powerful system that allows manipulation \nand discrimination of trafficking in distal axons from events in cell bodies (15). \nWhile there is considerable evidence for an endosome-mediated transport process \nfor transmitting neurotrophic signaling from the nerve terminal to the nucleus, there \nare alternative hypotheses for how activation of distal Trk receptors transmits infor-\nmation to the nucleus. One such alternative idea is that activation of a Trk receptor \ninitiates a ligand-independent cascade of phosphorylation of Trk receptors down the \nlength of the axon (67). A second possibility is that activation of Trk receptors at the \nnerve terminal leads to an increase in intracellular calcium (11), which as discussed \nabove, can be rapidly propagated to the nucleus. \n3.2 Translocation of Soluble Molecules Through the Process  \nto the Cell Soma \nAnother mechanism of signaling from distal compartments to the nucleus is via the \ntransport of soluble proteins through the neuronal process to the cell soma. This \ntransport could occur by passive diffusion or by active transport. Several theoretical \nstudies have indicated that passive diffusion of proteins through the cytoplasmic \nmilieu is not efficient for long-distance signaling (35), arguing that active, facilitated \ntransport of proteins is required for efficient signaling from synapse to soma. De-\npending on the size of the soluble molecule, once it reaches the soma, it may either \ndiffuse through the nuclear membrane (passive transport) or use specialized transport \nsystems and energy-dependent processes (active transport) to enter the nucleus. \n \nThe nucleus is separated from the cytoplasm by two membranes, forming the \nnuclear envelope. The outer membrane is continuous with the ER, and the space \nbetween the inner and outer membranes is continuous with the lumen of the ER. The \nnuclear envelope is perforated with nuclear pores, through which molecules can pass \nbetween the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Nuclear pores are formed by structures \nknown as nuclear pore complexes, octagonally-shaped channels, approximately 9 nm \nin diameter, and composed of more than 100 different proteins called nucleoporins"}
{"text": "===== Page 9 =====\nSignaling from Synapse to Nucleus\n609\n \n \n \n \n(48). The size of the channel formed by the nuclear pore complex limits the size of \nmolecules that can readily diffuse through the nuclear pore. Small molecules, such as \nions and second messengers can rapidly diffuse through the pore; larger molecules, \nincluding proteins up to approximately 40 kDa in size, can also diffuse through the \npore, although at a much slower rate; and proteins greater than approximately 40–60 \nkDa in size must be transported through the pore by facilitated, active nuclear im-\nport. \n3.3 The Active Nuclear Import Pathway \nProteins greater than 40-60 kDa, as well as some smaller proteins, are transported \ninto the nucleus through active, energy-dependent nuclear import, facilitated by one \nof a family of nuclear transport receptors called importins (or karyopherins). The \nlargest class of nuclear transporters is the importin βs (32), which bind directly to \ntheir cargoes and to the nucleoporins. More than 20 members of the importin β su-\nperfamily have been identified in humans, each of which transports a unique set of \ncargo proteins (38). In the classical nuclear import pathway, importin β1 binds its \ncargo through one of a family of nuclear import adaptors called importin αs. Six \nimportin αs have been identified in humans, and five in mice (38). \n \nImportin-mediated transport functions to carry any protein larger than ~40-60 kD \nfrom the cytoplasm into the nucleus. It thus is involved in the nuclear import of sig-\nnaling proteins activated by calcium transients in the somatic cytoplasm. Recent \nstudies have indicated that importin-mediated transport may additionally play a spe-\ncialized role in neurons in which it also functions to transport signals from distal \ncompartments to the nucleus (58, 61). Importins have been localized to distal axons \nand dendrites of a variety of types of neurons, including Aplysia sensory and motor \nneurons, rodent hippocampal neurons, and rodent sensory neurons (29, 73). In rodent \nCargo proteins are recognized by importins through a short amino acid sequence \nknown as a nuclear localization signal (NLS). The classical NLS, first described for \nthe large-T antigen of SV40, is a short stretch of basic amino acids, PKKKRKV (40). \nAnother type of classical NLS is bipartite, with two stretches of basic amino acids \nseparated by a short linker of nonbasic amino acids (the prototype being the NLS of \nnucleoplasmin, KRPAATKKKAGQAKKKK) (65). Although putative NLSs can be \ninferred from primary sequence data, they are defined empirically either by fusing \nthe sequence to a non-nuclear protein (which is then transported into the nucleus) or \nby mutational analysis. The part of importin α that binds to importin β1 is an NLS-\nlike domain in the N-terminus. In the absence of importin β1, this NLS-like domain \nis autoinhibitory and masks the NLS-binding portion of importin α. Thus, with im-\nportin β1 bound, the affinity of importin α for its cargo increases from the micromo-\nlar to the nanomolar range. The high affinity cargo-importin α-importin β1 complex \nis transported through the nuclear pore in an energy-dependent process in a mecha-\nnism that is not entirely understood. Inside the nucleus, the complex is disassembled \nwhen the small GTP-binding protein Ran, in its GTP-bound form, binds to importin \nβ1, dissociating it from importin α and the NLS-bearing proteins.

Martin \n \nmotor neurons, importin-mediated transport from sites of injury to the nucleus has \nbeen shown to be required for transcription-dependent phases of regeneration follow-\ning axonal crush injury (29). In rodent hippocampal and Aplysia sensory neurons, \nimportins have been shown to translocate from distal sites to the nucleus during \ntranscription-dependent forms of learning-related synaptic plasticity, and in Aplysia \nneurons, blockade of active nuclear import has been shown to block long-term plas-\nticity (73). \n \nOne important consideration regarding importin-mediated transport from synapse \nto nucleus has is that there is no amplification of the signal from the site of initiation \nto the nucleus. Unlike action potentials or retrograde calcium signals, the number of \nmolecules being transmitted is limited by the amount of that material at the stimu-\nlated synapse. Adams and Dudek (1) have referred to this as a problem of \nstoichiometry, in which the small amount of protein transported from stimulated \nsynapses has to compete with a large amount of protein in the nucleus, and is thus \nunlikely to make significant contributions to transcriptional change. Essentially, this \nis a signal to noise problem. This problem is less significant if the signal is an en-\nzyme, since the enzymatic activity serves to amplify the signal. Additionally, it is not \nclear whether a threshold number of transcription factors is required to trigger sig-\nnificant changes in transcription and gene expression. \n4 Examples of Signaling Between Distal Compartments  \nand the Nucleus in Neurons \nRetrograde signaling is required for the growth, survival and adaptability of neurons \nthroughout development and adult life. Insights into the cell biological pathways \nutilized by neurons to mediate long-distance transport to the soma have emerged \n \nIn Aplysia neurons, Richard Ambron and colleagues (5) found that when a large \nprotein (human serum albumin) was coupled to the SV40 NLS and microinjected \ninto a distal growth cone, it translocated to the nucleus in a manner that required an \nintact microtubule network. These studies indicated both that the nuclear import \nmachinery (importins) was present in distal growth cones and that transport of im-\nportins and their cargoes occurred along microtubules. More recently, Hanz et al. \ndescribed an interaction between importin α and dynein motor proteins in the motor \nneuron axon (29). In a second study, they found that importin β1 interacts with \nvimentin in motor neurons, and that vimentin serves to couple importin β1 bound to \na cargo (in this case, mitogen-activated protein kinase 42/44) to the dynein motor \nprotein complex. While the details of this pathway have not been elucidated, these \nresults are consistent with the idea that importins retrogradely transport their protein \ncargoes from distal sites to the soma along microtubule tracks in axons and den-\ndrites, in a dynein-motor protein-dependent manner. Interestingly, Giri et al. (23) \nrecently found that the intracellular domain of the ErbB2 tyrosine kinase receptor \ninteracts with importin β1, and that this interaction is required for its transport into \nthe soma and signaling to the nucleus. Since this interaction occurred when ErbB2 \nwas intact, it suggests that importins may also be involved in the retrograde transport \nof signaling endosomes."}
{"text": "===== Page 11 =====\nSignaling from Synapse to Nucleus\n611\n \n \n \n \nfrom studies in a variety of systems. Together, these studies indicate that each of the \nvarious pathways outlined above are used to transduce signals received at distal \ncompartments to the nucleus in response to distinct stimuli. \n4.1 Retrograde Transport of Signals from Distal Compartments  \nto the Nucleus During Development of the Synapse \nA number of studies have indicated that synaptogenesis and synapse differentiation \nare accompanied by transcriptional changes pre- and post-synaptically (reviewed in \n(41)). Although the signaling cascades and factors that initiate transcriptional \nchanges during synapse formation are not well understood, a number of studies have \nbegun to elucidate potential candidates. These include signaling by neurotrophins as \nwell the Wingless-Int (wnt) and Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ) signaling \npathways. In each of these pathways, signaling from synapse to nucleus appears to \noccur via signaling endosomes. \nStudies of the role of target-derived growth factors in promoting transcriptional \nchanges in the nuclei of innervating neurons have provided the bulk of evidence for \nthe signaling endosome pathway outlined above (22, 33, 36). Briefly, growth factors \nbind to their cognate Trk receptors and are internalized in endosomes that are retro-\ngradely transported the distance of the axon to the cell soma. In the cell body, the \nligand-bound Trk receptors retain their catalytic activity, and signal to downstream \nsignaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phos-\nphotidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3 kinase) and phospholipase C-γ pathways. The end \nresult is the transduction of target-derived signals (initially received at great dis-\ntances from the soma) to the nucleus where they alter transcription. \nBudnik and colleagues have shown in flies that wingless is secreted from pre-\nsynaptic terminals during synaptogenesis and binds to the Drosophila frizzled2 re-\nceptor (dFrizzled2). dFrizzled2 is internalized into endosomes in the presynaptic \nterminal and travels back, in a dynein-dependent manner, to the soma of the postsy-\nnaptic cell, where the cytoplasmic tail is cleaved and then translocated into the nu-\ncleus where it may regulate transcription (52).Interestingly, the retrograde transport \nof dFrizzled2 was also shown to depend on Drosophila glutamate receptor interact-\ning protein (dGRIP), a synaptically localized PDZ-domain containing protein (7). \nStudies of synapse formation at the neuromuscular junction of Drosophila have \nalso revealed that a TGFβ protein called Gbb is released from the muscle and binds \nto a TGFβ receptor (53, 54, 63). Ligand binding to this receptor in turn leads to \nphosphorylation of the cytoplasmic protein mammalian mothers against decapenta-\nplegic, SMAD, which in turn associates with a co-SMAD protein to translocate into \nthe nucleus and regulate transcription. Several findings indicate that this retrograde \ntransport involves signaling endosomes: TGFβ ligands and receptors are transported \nin vesicles along axons (39); and nuclear phospho-SMAD as well as the functional \neffects of TGFβ signaling are both blocked by inhibitors of the dynein motor protein \npathway (3, 54). \nStudies in Drosophila have also revealed a role for importin-mediated signaling \nduring axon guidance and synapse formation. Thus, Kumar et al. (45) expressed a \ntruncated importin β, which acts as a general inhibitor of all importin-mediated"}

Photoreceptors initially projected their axons correctly but \nlater failed to enter the optic stalk, leading to an extensive network of misguided \naxons. Disruption of importin function also led to adhesion defects that caused neu-\nrons to descend below the appropriate layer. The authors concluded that axon guid-\nance and cell adhesion in the eye rely on importin β-mediated nuclear signaling. \n4.2 Transport of Signals from Synapse to Nucleus During Synaptic \nPlasticity \nLong-lasting forms of memory and of learning-related synaptic plasticity have been \nshown to depend on transcription (2, 42), indicating that signals received at distal \nsynapses are transmitted to the nucleus. Studies in a variety of systems have revealed \nroles for rapid action potential mediated signaling, importin-mediated active nuclear \nimport as well as for signaling endosome-mediated transport during transcription-\ndependent plasticity. Many of these studies have focused on the activity-dependent \ninduction of transcription mediated by the cAMP-responsive element binding protein \n(CREB). This approach is based on research showing that long-term facilitation \n(LTF) of Aplysia sensory-motor synapses, long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippo-\ncampal synapses, and long-term hippocampal-mediated memories in rodents all \nrequire cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-driven gene expression (43, 49). The tran-\nscriptional activity of CREB is activated by phosphorylation at a particular site, \nserine 133, and antibodies that specifically recognize CREB phosphorylated at this \nsite (21) have been very useful in identifying pathways whereby activity leads to \nCREB phosphorylation in the nucleus during long-term synaptic plasticity. Such \nstudies have shown that both calcium and cAMP signaling cascades trigger CREB \nphosphorylation, and have defined roles for a number of specific kinases, including \ncalcium-calmodulin dependent kinases (CaMKs), MAPKs, and the cAMP-dependent \nkinase (PKA). \nStudies of plasticity at mammalian hippocampal synapses have revealed roles for \nrapid calcium-dependent signaling to the nucleus during transcription-dependent \nLTP. Thus, Dudek and Fields (18) have demonstrated that somatic action potentials \nare sufficient to induce CREB phosphorylation and to induce specific immediate \nearly genes in hippocampal neurons. Based on these findings, Dudek has argued that \na synapse-to-nucleus signal is not required to induce transcription during the late \nphase of hippocampal LTP (1). Consistent with this idea, Bading and colleagues (31) \nhave shown that depolarization and electrical stimulation of cultured hippocampal \nneurons can lead to CREB phosphorylation in a manner that depends entirely on \ncalcium waves in the nucleus and is independent of any import of cytoplasmic pro-\nteins into the nucleus. These studies indicate that depolarizing stimuli trigger action \npotentials and/or regenerative calcium waves in the ER, and that the increased cal-\ncium in the nucleus in turn activates nuclear kinases that phosphorylate CREB and \nactivate CRE-driven gene expression. \nEarlier studies from Richard Tsien and colleagues (16) had shown that brief \nbursts of activity in cultured hippocampal neurons triggered CREB phosphorylation \nwithin one minute, and that this was mediated by the translocation of calmodulin"}
{"text": "===== Page 13 =====\nSignaling from Synapse to Nucleus\n613\n \n \n \n \nfrom the somatic cytoplasm into the nucleus, where it activated CamKIV. The Tsien \ngroup (82) also demonstrated that strongly depolarizing stimuli recruited a second \npathway that leads to CREB phosphorylation. Activation of this pathway, the \nras/MAPK pathway resulted in a slower and more persistent phosphorylation of \nCREB. Bading and colleagues (30) also described a pathway whereby bursts of ac-\ntivity in cultured hippocampal neurons led to calcium increases near NMDA recep-\ntors, which in turn activated MAPK. MAPK then translocated into the nucleus, \nwhere it activated both serum response element (SRE)-driven gene expression as \nwell as CREB phosphorylation. Notably, the phosphorylation of CREB mediated by \nMAPK nuclear translocation was more sustained than CREB phosphorylation medi-\nated by nuclear calcium increases. Together, these studies indicate that depolarizing \nstimuli can activate cytosolic signaling molecules that are subsequently transported \ninto the nucleus where they function to alter transcription. They further reveal that \nsignaling to the nucleus can occur in a more rapid and transient manner or in more \nsustained and persistent manner. What remained unclear from these experiments, \nhowever, was whether or not these signaling molecules were transported from distal \nsynapses to the nucleus or whether the signaling molecules were generated in the \nsoma in response to depolarization, and subsequently transported into the nucleus. \nThat signals can indeed be transported from distal synapses to the nucleus during \nlearning-related synaptic plasticity is clear from studies of long-term facilitation of \nAplysia sensory-motor synapses. At this synapse, five spaced applications of the \nmodulatory neurotransmitter serotonin (5HT) produce LTF, which is dependent on \nboth mRNA and protein synthesis (42). Localized application of 5HT to distal synap-\ntic sites is sufficient to recruit transcription-dependent LTF (50, 69), indicating that \nsignals can in fact travel from a distal synpase to the nucleus. 5HT stimulation of \nsensory neurons increases cAMP concentrations in the sensory neuron, leading to \nactivation of PKA and MAPK (62). Importantly, 5HT does not increase intracellular \ncalcium in sensory neurons (13) and does not depolarize sensory neurons, indicating \nthat the signal is likely to travel as a soluble signal through the cytoplasm, and not as \nan electrical signal or in the form of an intracellular calcium wave. \nThompson et al. (73) have provided evidence that importins function to carry \nsignals from distal Aplysia synapses to the nucleus during LTF. Thus, they found that \nimportin α was present at the synapse of Aplysia sensory-motor neurons, and further \nshowed that stimuli that elicited LTF triggered importin translocation into the nu-\ncleus of the sensory neuron. Inhibition of importin-mediated transport into the nu-\ncleus by microinjection of anti-nuclear pore antibodies into the sensory neuron \nblocked LTF without affecting basal synaptic transmission or short term, transcrip-\ntion-independent plasticity. In the same study, Thompson and colleagues also \nshowed that importins were present at synapses of rodent hippocampal neurons, and \nthat importin α was present in post-synaptic density fractions. Activation of the \nNMDA receptor in dissociated hippocampal neurons triggered translocation of im-\nportins into the nucleus. In hippocampal slices, stimuli that elicited late-phase, tran-\nscription-dependent LTP also induced an NMDA receptor-dependent increase in the \nconcentration of importin in the nuclei of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Together, these \nfindings indicate that importins function to carry signals from the synapse to the nu-\ncleus during transcription-dependent forms of learning-related synaptic plasticity (58)."}
{"text": "===== Page 14 =====\n614 \nC.L. Heusner and K.C. Martin \n \nWhat are the cargoes of importins that travel from the synapse to the nucleus dur-\ning synaptic plasticity? A number of interesting candidate molecules exist, although \ndirect demonstration that importins do transport these molecules from synapse to \nnucleus during plasticity is lacking. Some of these cargoes are transcription factors \nthat localize constitutively to the cytoplasm, and travel to the nucleus following \nstimulation. One such cargo is the nuclear factor-kappa b (NF-κB), which has been \nshown to translocate from synapse to nucleus of hippocampal neurons following \nglutamatergic stimulation and to play a role in learning and memory (55, 75). A \nrecent study demonstrated that the retrograde transport of NFκB in hippocampal \nneurons occurs along microtubules, and that it requires dynein motor proteins and an \nintact NLS in NFκB (57). This study thus strongly suggests that importins do func-\ntion to carry NFκB from synapse to nucleus. Nuclear factor of activated T-cells \n(NFATc4) is another transcription factor that has been shown to undergo stimulus-\ndependent translocation from dendrites to nucleus in hippocampal neurons (25, 26). \nIt also contains an NLS and is known to require importins for its nuclear transport \n(81), suggesting that it may translocate to the nucleus in an importin-dependent man-\nner. In Aplysia neurons, a recent study by Kaang and colleagues (46) discovered that \nduring LTF of sensory-motor synapses, a cell-adhesion molecule associated protein \n(CAMAP) is phosphorylated by PKA and translocates from the synapse to the nu-\ncleus where it functions as a transcriptional co-activator. CAMAP was found to \ninteract with importin α, suggesting that it may be transported through the neurite in \nan importin-dependent manner. Studies in a number of systems have revealed roles \nfor nuclear translocation of kinases, including PKA and MAPK, during transcription-\ndependent forms of plasticity (42, 72), and these signaling molecules are thus also \npotential cargoes of importins for trafficking from distal synapses to the nucleus \n(although, see (78)). \nStudies of the role of brain-derived growth factor (BDNF) suggest a role for sig-\nnaling endosomes in transmitting signals from synapse to nucleus during transcrip-\ntion-dependent plasticity. Thus, BDNF binding to the TrkB receptor has been shown \nto be critical to long-lasting forms of long-term potentiation at hippocampal synapses \n(44, 59). Since BDNF-bound TrkB receptors are internalized into endosomes and \nsubsequently travel to the nucleus in signaling endosomes (86), it is possible that \nBDNF recruits a signaling endosome pathway to transmit signals to the nucleus \nduring learning-related synaptic plasticity. \n4.3 Transport of Signals from Distal Axons to the Nucleus During Injury \nand Regeneration \nIn the peripheral nervous system, regeneration following axonal injury requires new \ntranscription, indicating that signals are transmitted from the site of injury to the cell \nbody (for review see (28, 70)). The transcriptional component includes (1) a rapid \ncomponent that depends on injury-induced action potentials that signal from the site \nof injury to the soma; and (2) a slower component that depends both on a decrease in \nthe normal trafficking of trophic factors to the soma and on the transport of injury-\ninduced signals from the site of injury to the nucleus (28, 61). Studies of injury-\ninduced growth in Aplysia neurons has provided clear evidence that injury-induced"}
{"text": "===== Page 15 =====\nSignaling from Synapse to Nucleus\n615\n \n \n \n \nsignals are transported to the nucleus. Thus, Richard Ambron and colleagues (6, 85) \nhave shown that axoplasm isolated from lesioned neurons elicits neuronal growth \nwhen microinjected into uninjured neurons. They found that many of these proteins \ncontained NLSs, suggesting that they used importin-mediated transport mechanisms \nto be transported from the site of injury to the nucleus (4). \nStudies in lesioned dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and in sciatic nerve have \nprovided strong evidence that importins play a central role in carrying signals from \nsites of injury to the nucleus (29, 60). In these studies, Michael Fainzilber and col-\nleagues showed that importin α was present in axons. They further showed that im-\nportin β1 mRNA was present in axons where it was locally translated following \naxonal injury. Saturation of the active import pathway with excess NLS peptides \ndelayed regenerative outgrowth in culture and inhibited the growth-enhancing effects \nof an in vivo conditioning lesion. These findings are consistent with importin-\nmediated signaling functioning to transport injury signals to the nucleus to initiate \ntranscription-dependent regeneration. \n5 Concluding Remarks \nSites of signal initiation in neurons can occur at great distances from the nucleus. In \nthe case of dendrites, synapses can be hundreds of microns away from the soma, and \nin the case of axons, synapses can be as far as a meter from the soma. These dis-\ntances pose a significant challenge to the transport of signals from the site of initia-\ntion to the nucleus. Given that many processes in neurons depend on stimulus-\ninduced changes in gene expression, the question of how signals are transported from \ndistal sites to the nucleus is of great interest. \nA number of mechanisms exist whereby signals can be delivered from their site \nof initiation to the nucleus. Rapid signaling mechanisms include (1) electrochemical \nsignaling to the soma via action potentials or dendritic spikes and (2) regenerative \ncalcium waves in the ER. Slower signaling mechanisms include (1) active transport \nof signaling molecules from distal compartments to the nucleus, either as soluble \nproteins (e.g. via importin-mediated retrograde transport) or as signaling endosomes, \nas well as (2) passive diffusion of signaling molecules to the nucleus. When and how \nneurons use each of these cell biological pathways is only beginning to be eluci-\ndated. The data indicate that distinct stimuli likely recruit distinct synapse-to-nucleus \nsignaling pathways, and that each of these functions to produce changes over various \ntime domains. Cell biological investigations into the mechanisms of signal transduc-\ntion between synapse and nucleus, and between growth cone and nucleus, promise to \nprovide insight into the many physiological and pathological processes in the brain \nthat depend on stimulus-induced changes in gene expression. \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors thank Besim Uzgil and other members of the Martin lab for comments \nand helpful discussions, Donna Crandall for graphic work and Michael Poon for"}

{"text": "===== Page 3 =====\nMolecular Organization of the Postsynaptic Membrane at Inhibitory Synapses\n623\n \n \n \n1 Pharmacology of GABAA and Glycine Receptors \nThe three major GABA receptor types in the brain were initially identified based on \ntheir pharmacological and electrophysiological properties. GABA type A receptors \n(GABAA receptors) are ligand-gated ion channels, activated by muscimol and inhib-\nited by bicuculline (141). A second GABA receptor (termed GABAB receptor) is \ninsensitive to these agents, but is activated by baclofen, inhibited by 2-\nhydroxysaclofen and produces a slower inhibitory response (20, 91). GABAB recep-\ntors are G protein-coupled receptors that mediate their inhibitory effects by coupling \nto ion channels (for a detailed review of GABAB receptors see (45)). In addition to \nGABAA and GABAB receptors, a third GABA receptor type (GABAC receptor), \ninsensitive to both bicuculline and baclofen, but sensitive to the GABA analogue cis-\n4-aminocrotonic acid and picrotoxin, has also been identified (56, 162, 180). GABAC \nreceptors are ligand-gated ion channels, homologous in structure to the GABAA \nreceptor but are primarily expressed in the retina (56, 162). Glycine receptors are \nprimarily expressed in the brain stem and spinal cord where they play a crucial role \nin regulating inhibitory tone (49, 228). Glycine receptors are similar in structure to \nGABAA and GABAC receptors, are activated by glycine and also potentially taurine, \nbut are insensitive to picrotoxin and instead are inhibited by the plant alkaloid \nstrychnine (139). \n \nA range of compounds, several of which are clinically relevant therapeutic \nagents, can allosterically modulate GABAA receptor and glycine receptor function. \nGABAA receptor function is modulated by benzodiazepines, barbiturates, steroids, \nanesthetics and ethanol (141, 157, 181) (Fig.1). Benzodiazepines (such as diazepam) \npotentiate GABA responses by increasing GABAA channel opening frequency (141, \n209). Diazepam has also been reported to increase channel conductance of some \nnative receptors (58), which may be due to receptor interactions with GABAA recep-\ntor associated proteins (62). Barbiturates, such as pentobarbital, enhance GABA \nresponses by increasing the open probability of GABA-activated channels and have \nalso been reported to enhance single channel conductance of some native receptors, \nand directly activate GABAA receptors at high concentrations (11, 18, 59, 141, 144, \n209). General anesthetics such as isoflurane and halothane increase GABA-induced \ncurrents by potentiating the action of GABA or by directly activating the channel \n(for reviews see (66, 81)). Ethanol has also been shown to have a potentiating effect \non GABAA receptors (for reviews see (51, 141, 171, 189)). Recently, elegant work \nfrom several groups have reported that GABAA receptors containing the δ subunit \nare enhanced by low alcohol concentrations that are thought to mediate alcohol ef-\nfects experienced during social drinking, although several controversies with respect \nto these findings remain (for detailed discussions see (158, 171, 189)). GABAA re-\nceptors are also subject to regulation by several endogenous modulators including \nsteroids, protons and Zn2+ (9, 93, 141). At low nanomolar concentrations which \noccur during stress, alcohol intoxication and pregnancy/oestrous, neurosteroids, such \nas allopregnanolone and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosteroneprogesterone, can potentiate \nGABA responses. At higher concentrations (submicromolar to micromolar), which \nmay occur during parturition, neurosteroids can directly activate the receptor (for \ndetailed reviews see (9, 93, 124, 157)). GABAA receptors are also inhibited by a"}
{"text": "===== Page 4 =====\n624 \nI.L. Arancibia-Carcamo et al. \n \nnumber of pharmacological agents. Picrotoxin, a plant convulsant, is a noncompeti-\ntive GABAA receptor inhibitor that is thought to act by binding to a site within the \nchannel (241) leading to stabilization of receptors in an agonist bound desensitized \nstate (164). In addition, GABAA receptors lacking the γ subunit, and therefore likely \nextrasynaptic, are inhibited by Zn2+ (201). Although the pharmacology of glycine \nreceptors is not as rich as that of GABA receptors, glycine receptor function is en-\nhanced by several of the same agents that potentiate GABA receptors, such as alco-\nhols, anesthetics, and neurosteroids (30, 81, 87, 128, 153). Glycine receptors are also \nsensitive to Zn2+ which potentiates receptor activation at submicromolar Zn2+ con-\ncentrations, but causes inhibition at concentrations greater than 10 μM (13, 201). In a \nphysiological context, low nanomolar basal Zn2+ concentrations are sufficient to \nprolong the decay phase of glycinergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (128). In \ncontrast, an equivalent of benzodiazepines is lacking for glycine receptors. \n2 Molecular Identification of GABAA Receptors and Glycine \nReceptors \nGABAA receptors and glycine receptors are members of the Cys-loop ligand gated \nion channel family of receptors, which also include nicotinic acetylcholine receptors \n(nACh receptors), GABAC receptors and serotonin (5HT3) receptors (44, 192, 222). \nThe glycine receptor was the first neurotransmitter receptor to be isolated from the \nmammalian brain using aminostrychnine-agarose affinity chromatography, taking \nadvantage of the high affinity interaction (KD 1–10 nM) of the receptor with strych-\nnine (175). The receptor appeared to be a complex of three proteins: a 48 kDa α \nsubunit, 58 kDa β subunit, and an additional 93 kDa protein (80). Several biochemi-\ncal studies of the purified form of glycine receptors have established that the integral \nmembrane α and β subunit glycoproteins represent the constitutive subunits of the \nreceptor (122). Cross-linking techniques showed that α and β subunits assemble to \nform the channel-containing transmembrane core of the glycine receptor. The size of \nthe complex (250 kDa) suggested a pentameric assembly of the subunits giving a \nquaternary structure that is now well established for all members of the Cys-loop \nfamily of receptors (Fig. 1). In contrast to the receptor, the co-purifying 93-kDa \nprotein, gephyrin, is a nonglycosylated polypeptide that can interact reversibly with \nthe α/β pentamer. Gephyrin is a cytoplasmic extrinsic membrane protein that plays a \nkey role in regulating glycine receptor localization as discussed below.  \n3 Molecular Diversity and Distribution Pattern of Glycine \nReceptor Subunit Isoforms \nInitial biochemical and immunochemical studies during spinal cord development \nestablished the notion of glycine receptor subtypes (128). A comparison of glycine \nreceptor expression in neonatal and adult membranes revealed that a distinct form of \nglycine receptor predominated around birth (neonatal receptor, GlyRN). It is charac-"}
{"text": "===== Page 5 =====\nMolecular Organization of the Postsynaptic Membrane at Inhibitory Synapses\n625\n \n \n \nterized pharmacologically by its relatively low strychnine-binding affinity. It is com-\nposed of pentamers of 49 kDa polypetides denominated α2 and it is found mainly \nduring the fetal and neonatal stages. This supported the notion of a developmental \nswitch from GlyRN to the adult form, GlyRA, corresponding to the formation of \nα1/β heteromers. This switch occurs in the spinal cord within 3 weeks after birth, \nand is not as complete in other regions of the nervous system. One current view is \nthat postsynaptic glycine receptors correspond to a mixture of α2 pentamers and \nα2/β heteromers in immature neurons, while α1/β heteromers predominate in mature \nsynapses. Currently, the greater diversity of glycine receptor subunits is established \nto include not only α1 and α2 but also α3 and α2* subunits (139) and in addition an \nα4 subunit has also been identified in mouse, which is absent in rat and human \n(145). These highly homologous isoforms can form glycine-gated chloride channels \nof comparable strychnine sensitivity, except α2*, which is 99% identical to human \nα2 shows a 500-fold lower sensitivity to strychnine (123). Further, alternative exon \nusage increases glycine receptor diversity. For the α1 subunit, eight additional amino \nacids can be inserted in the M3–M4 loop. This sequence contains a serine residue, \nwhich is a potential phosphorylation site allowing a functional modulation of the α1 \nsubunit. Alternative splicing has also been identified for the α2 and α3 subunits (139).  \n \nIn situ hybridization (122, 182) revealed that the distribution of individual gly-\ncine receptor subunits was not identical for all variants. The mRNAs encoding the \nα1 and α3 subunits are mainly transcribed in spinal cord and brain stem at later \npostnatal stages. The α3 subunit mRNA is present in the infralimbic system, the \nhippocampal complex, and the cerebellar granular layer. Expression levels of the α2 \nsubunit, by contrast, are high in the embryonic and perinatal stages, but barely de-\ntectable in the adult brain, with some expression in higher cortical regions. The α4 \nsubunit, which is expressed at low levels in the adult brain and spinal cord, can form \nfunctional glycine receptors, which are restricted to the spinal cord and the sympa-\nthetic nervous system. Compared to the α subunit transcripts, the β subunit mRNA is \nmore widely expressed throughout the embryonic and adult nervous system (103) \nand is found in brain loci devoid of strychnine-binding sites or glycine receptor im-\nmunoreactivity. The physiological significance of this widespread β subunit mRNA \nexpression is not understood, and there is no evidence that glycine receptor β sub-\nunits assemble with subunits of other Cys-loop receptor family members. \n4 Molecular Heterogeneity of GABAA Receptors \nA total of 16 genes encoding GABAA receptor subunits have been identified in the \nmammalian nervous system. The GABAA receptor was initially purified using \nGABA/benzodiazepine affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed two \nreceptor subunits, α and β, with molecular weights of 53 kDa and 58 kDa respec-\ntively (199, 200). Oligonucleotides, designed based on peptide microsequencing \nresults, were used for screening bovine cDNA libraries and allowed for the cloning \nof both α and β subunits. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of α and β subunits \nrevealed that these receptor subunits showed significant homology with each other \nand with other members of the Cys-loop receptors such as the nAChRs. Based on"}
{"text": "===== Page 6 =====\n626 \nI.L. Arancibia-Carcamo et al. \n \namino acid sequence homology six α subunits as well as three β subunits have been \nidentified (96, 98, 133, 134, 137, 142, 238). Co-expression of α and β subunits in \nheterologous systems, however, formed receptors that lacked benzodiazepine sensi-\ntivity, a pharmacological trait observed in neuronal GABAA receptors. A novel \nGABAA receptor subunit that when co-expressed with α and β subunits inferred \nbenzodiazepine sensitivity on the assembled receptors was then identified (179). This \nsubunit, termed γ2, shows 42% and 35% identity to the α1 and β1 subunits respec-\ntively. Three γ subunits have been identified in total (179, 197, 231, 239). In addition \nto α, β and γ subunits other receptor subunits have been identified: δ (197), ε (50), π \n(90) and θ (17). In addition some of these genes, including the α6 (121), β2 (146), β3 \n(101), ε (230) and γ2 subunits (229), undergo alternative splicing resulting in a long \n(L) and short (S) version of the gene product. However, a complete understanding of \nthe physiological relevance of these splice variants remains to be addressed. \n \nIn situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies have provided a detailed \npicture of the regional and cellular expression patterns of GABAA receptor subunit \nmRNA and corresponding receptor subunit protein, in the nervous system (67, 82, \n126, 127, 159, 174, 176, 198, 232, 240). The α1, β2/3, and γ2 subunits are the most \nabundant and broadly expressed GABAA receptor subunits in the brain and spinal \ncord (126, 174, 176, 232). In agreement with this, gene deletion studies have re-\nvealed that α1 and β2 subunits account for up to half of all GABAA receptors in the \nCNS (212). The α1 subunit is found to be present, at high levels, in most regions of \nthe adult brain (88, 176) but not in embryonic or neonatal brain, where it is expressed \nat low levels (127). The α2 subunit is found in most brain regions, except the thala-\nmus and globus pallidum, although at lower levels than the α1 subunit (176). The α3 \nand α4 are the least abundant α subunits in the adult brain. The α3 subunit is highly \nexpressed in early developmental stages, but at low levels in the adult brain (176, \n240) where it is concentrated in the cerebral cortex, mainly on monoaminergic neu-\nrons (72), the basal forebrain, on cholinergic neurons (73), and the thalamic reticular \nnucleus (69). In contrast the α4 subunit is restricted to the thalamus, the striatum and \nthe molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (176, 232). The α5 subunit is evenly ex-\npressed throughout development and enriched in the CA1 region of the hippocam-\npus, although expression levels show a continuous decrease with aging (240). In \ncontrast the α6 subunit is found almost exclusively, postnatally in the granular layer \nof the cerebellum (126, 127, 176).  \n \nDespite a wide distribution of all three β subunits, β1 is expressed at much lower \nlevels compared to β2 and β3 subunits (176). Although there is considerable overlap \nin the expression of β2 and β3 subunits, there are some regions where higher expres-\nsion of one β subunit in certain brain regions comes at the expense of another. For \nexample, β2 subunits are highly expressed in the adult thalamus in comparison to β1 \nand β3 subunits (176, 194, 232), although the β3 subunit is expressed at higher levels \nthan the β2 in the fetal and neo-natal thalamus (127). The β3 subunit is expressed at \nhigh levels in the striatum where very low levels of the β2 subunit are found. In \naddition, β1 and β3 subunits are found at higher concentrations than the β2 subunit in \nthe hippocampus (232). Furthermore, in the hippocampus, the β2 subunit is found \nconcentrated in non-pyramidal neurons, whereas β1 and β3 subunits are found in \nprimary pyramidal neurons (155, 161, 176, 232)."}
{"text": "===== Page 7 =====\nMolecular Organization of the Postsynaptic Membrane at Inhibitory Synapses\n627\n \n \n \n \nOf the γ subunit isoforms, the γ2 subunit is, by far, the most abundant. However, \nall three γ subunits are found widely distributed, with the γ1 subunit expressed at \nhigher concentrations in the pallidum and substantia nigra whereas the γ3 subunit is \nslightly more concentrated in the cerebral cortex (126, 127, 176, 232). Similar to \nother GABAA receptor subunits, the expression of γ1 and γ3 is altered during devel-\nopment, with these two subunits being expressed at higher levels pre-natally (127). \nFurthermore, the γ2 subunit also shows a small but significant reduction in expres-\nsion levels with aging (240). Importantly, the γ1 and γ3 subunits are unable to fully \nsubstitute for the essential γ2 subunit in γ2 knockout mice, which show a lethal phe-\nnotype (4, 61). In contrast to the γ subunits, the δ subunit of GABAA receptors is \nmost highly expressed in the thalamus and in the granular layer of the cerebellum \nwhere it is thought to assemble into receptors which contain either α4 or α6 subunits, \nrespectively (176). The ε, π and θ subunits are the least abundant GABAA receptor \nsubunits expressed in the CNS. The ε subunit has been observed in the hypothala-\nmus, amygdala and brainstem (160). Interestingly, the θ subunit has also been ob-\nserved in all these regions as well as the substantia nigra and hippocampus (160). \nThe π subunit appears to be expressed mainly in the uterus, although low expression \nlevels have been observed in the hippocampus (90). \n5 GABAA and Glycine Receptor Structure  \nGABAA receptors, glycine receptors and the other members of the Cys-loop receptor \nfamily are polytopic type I membrane proteins that share a common subunit structure \n(44). Each subunit encompasses a large extended N-terminal domain, bearing poten-\ntial glycosylation sites, four highly conserved transmembrane domains (deduced by \nhydropathy analysis), and a large intracellular loop of significantly lower homology \nbetween TM3 and TM4 which protrudes into the cytoplasm (TM3–TM4 loop; Fig. 1). \nThe four membrane-spanning domains form α helices (TM2) and/or β strands (TM1, \nTM3, TM4). Based on extensive biochemical and electron microscopy analysis of \nthe nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, members of this family are assumed to be pen-\ntameric in structure where subunits are arranged around a central aqueous pore (222). \nThe tertiary and quaternary structure of the soluble pentameric acetylcholine-binding \nprotein (AChBP), which shares approximately 20% sequence homology with \nnAChR, GABA and glycine receptors, has been useful in further elucidating struc-\nture–function parameters for receptors of the family (21, 202). In addition to improv-\ning our understanding of the binding of agonists, antagonists and modulators, (1, 35, \n92, 93, 201), the AChBP crystal structure provides a powerful model of the N-\nterminal domain of the Cys-loop receptor family. AChBP is mainly a sandwich of \nantiparallel β sheets positioning conserved residues in order to stabilize the protom-\ners, whereas variable residues are at their interface (21, 202). The topology of the \ntransmembrane domains (Fig. 1) delineates the ion permeation pathway away from \nthe hydrophobic core of the phospholipid bilayer. For all Cys-loop receptors, the \nsubunit’s α-helical TM2 domain lines the central water-filled pore, while TM1, \nTM3, and TM4 form the interface with the lipids and isolate TM2 from a hydropho-\nbic environment (44). Recent studies on the GlyR α1 subunit have challenged the"}
{"text": "===== Page 8 =====\n628 \nI.L. Arancibia-Carcamo et al. \n \nfour-helix model and provide evidence that whereas TM2 and TM4 are entirely \nhelical, TM1 and TM3 also contain β strands. \n6 Glycine Receptor Assembly  \nThe α1 and β subunits assemble as a pentameric complex of 2α:3β stoichiometry \n(84, 102). Short amino acid sequences, named assembly boxes, all located in the N-\nterminal domain of the β subunit and corresponding to three diverging motifs in α \nand β subunits, have been identified (83, 102, 154). They have a role in determining \nreceptor assembly. Replacement of these motifs in the β subunit by the correspond-\ning α1 motifs results in the loss of the subunit ratio in α/β oligomers, suggesting that \ndifferent amino acid positions are determinants in the early step of subunit–subunit \ninteraction. These residues impose a mutually exclusive mode of assembly, either in \ncomplexes of invariant α/β stoichiometry or in homo-oligomers. A 2α−3β stoi-\nchiometry has recently been established following affinity purification of expressed \nengineered tandem subunits (84). These experiments indicated that the β subunit \ncontributes to the agonist binding properties of hetero-oligomeric α1/β glycine re-\nceptors. In fact, ionic interactions at the α/β interface are required to stabilize glycine \nin its binding pocket. This feature, with an agonist binding shared between two adja-\ncent subunits is characteristic of the Cys-loop receptor family and also holds true for \nGABAA receptors (102, 162). \n7 GABAA Receptor Assembly and Composition of Plasma \nMembrane Receptors \nThe large diversity of GABAA receptor subunits generates the potential for a bewil-\ndering heterogeneity of receptor structure. However, a number of functional, bio-\nchemical and immunocytochemical studies have revealed that only a limited number \nof receptor subunit combinations are likely to exist on the neuronal cell surface (162, \n198). Restriction on GABAA receptor molecular heterogeneity in the brain is due to a \nnumber of factors. GABAA receptor subunit composition is in part restricted by the \nregional and temporal selectivity in subunit expression (69, 176, 198). In addition, a \nnumber of assembly rules further restrict the heterogeneity of native GABAA recep-\ntors (44). Expression studies indicated that individual GABAA receptor subunits do \nnot result in the formation of GABA gated channels. Expression of β1 and β3 sub-\nunits alone results in the formation of chloride permeable channels that are sensitive \nto picrotoxin and barbiturates, however, these channels are insensitive to application \nof GABA. In contrast, co-expression of α and β subunits results in the production of \nfunctional GABA gated chloride channels sensitive to picrotoxin, bicuculline, barbi-\nturates and Zn2+ (55, 133, 192). This is in agreement with the binding site for GABA \nlying at the interface of α and β subunits (14, 15, 141). However, the co-expression \nof α and β subunits does not form channels that are sensitive to benzodiazepine \nmodulation, which represents the pharmacology of most native receptors. It is only"}
{"text": "===== Page 9 =====\nMolecular Organization of the Postsynaptic Membrane at Inhibitory Synapses\n629\n \n \n \nwhen γ subunits are additionally co-expressed with α and β subunits that GABA \ngated, benzodiazepine sensitive channels are formed (239) (179), which are in addi-\ntion insensitive to Zn2+ modulation (201).  \n \nAs shown with fluorescence, only certain GABAA receptor subunit combinations \ncan access the cell surface whereas other subunit combinations are retained within the \nendoplasmic reticulum (ER) (15, 43, 44, 162). This suggested the existence of mo-\nlecular mechanisms to restrict the surface expression of receptors with given composi-\ntions. With exception of the β1, β3 and γ2S subunits, individual GABAA receptor \nsubunits are mostly retained in the ER (43). Moreover, pulse chase experiments dem-\nonstrated that α1 and β2 subunits are rapidly degraded when expressed alone (77), \nsuggesting that these proteins are targeted for degradation from the ER. Importantly, \nGABAA receptor subunits have been shown to associate with BiP and calnexin (43, \n77), two chaperone molecules which assist in protein quality control in the ER (114). \nInitial studies suggested that assembly was dependent on the N-terminus of receptor \nsubunits. Using a chimeric approach, four amino acids in the N-terminal domain of \nthe β3 subunit have been shown to mediate functional cell surface expression of this \nsubunit compared to β2 (215, 216). Introduction of these four amino acids into the N-\nterminus of the β2 subunit is sufficient to enable β2 homomerization and ER exit. \nThese four amino acids are also important for the oligomerization of β subunits with γ \nsubunits but not with α subunits. Interestingly, mutation of these four amino acids \nwithin the β3 subunit abolished its ability to form homomers but not its ability to \noligomerize with γ2L suggesting that at least one alternative signal for the assembly \nof β and γ subunits must exist (215, 216). A conserved domain in the N-terminus of α \nsubunits has also been identified to play a role in the oligomerization of α with β but \nnot γ subunits (15, 16, 215, 216). Furthermore, conserved glutamine and arginine \nresidues have been shown to independently play a key role in determining the assem-\nbly of α with β subunits (15, 16, 215, 216), whereas a conserved arginine in α, β and γ \nsubunits has been shown to be essential for subunit oligomerization (85). Finally, two \nregions within the N-terminus of the γ2 subunit have been shown to mediate assembly \nof this subunit with α and β subunits (111, 112). The above results together with bio-\nchemical experiments suggest that the most prevalent GABAA receptor subunit com-\nposition in the brain consists of α, β and γ subunits with a majority of receptors con-\ntaining 2α, 2β and 1γ subunit isoform (16, 68, 138, 141, 162).  \n8 Role of GABAA Receptor Subunit Composition in Determining \nSubcellular Localization \nImmunofluorescence and EM immunogold studies have revealed that α1, α2, α3, \nα6, β2/3 and γ2 subunits are enriched at postsynaptic domains of inhibitory synapses \nin many brain regions including cortex, hippocampus, globus pallidus and cerebel-\nlum (61, 64, 67–69, 166, 167, 198). These synaptically targeted receptor subunits can \nalso be found extrasynaptically (64). Immunocytochemical and immunogold electron \nmicroscopy studies have revealed that GABAA receptor subunit combinations can be \ntargeted to different subcellular domains (67, 68, 166–168). For example, although \nthe α1–3 and α5 subunits are all expressed in hippocampal and cerebellar cells, the"}
{"text": "===== Page 10 =====\n630 \nI.L. Arancibia-Carcamo et al. \n \nα2 subunit is found concentrated in the axon initial segment (AIS) of the majority of \ncells where it colocalizes with the inhibitory synaptic marker gephyrin (25, 168). In \ncontrast, the α1 subunit is found throughout the cell and shows both diffuse and \nclustered staining suggesting both a synaptic and extrasynaptic localization (25). \nInterestingly, the α1 subunit cannot be found in the AIS on its own and is always co-\nlocalized there with the α2 subunit suggesting that subunit composition of GABAA \nreceptors in the AIS consists of one copy of α1 and one of α2 (25). Recent functional \nexperiments in hippocampal pyramidal neurons have revealed that fast phasic re-\nsponses are mediated by synaptic α2 subunit containing GABAA receptors on the \ncell soma but synaptic α1 containing GABAA receptors on dendrites (177). Recep-\ntors containing α3 are differentially targeted depending on the cell type where they \nare expressed. In pyramidal cells, the α3 subunit is found in clusters at postsynaptic \nsites, whereas in a subset of hippocampal cells characterized by a round cell body \nand numerous short dendrites, α3 containing receptors show a diffuse expression \npattern across the membrane and are not found at synaptic sites (25). α5 subunits \nhave been found highly expressed in extrasynaptic locations on hippocampal den-\ndrites where it has been proposed they may contribute to tonic inhibition (25), but \nhave also been localized to synapses both by immunofluorescence and EM postem-\nbedding immunogold (40, 195). \n \nIn addition to the α subunit, receptor subcellular localization is also determined \nby the γ and δ subunits. In the cerebellum, immunocytochemical studies on electron \nmicroscopic sections demonstrated that synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors \ndiffered in their subunit composition. Synapses in cerebellar granule neurons are \npositive for the GABAA receptor γ2 subunit, whereas the δ subunit was found exclu-\nsively in extrasynaptic membranes (165). In the hippocampus δ subunits are local-\nized perisynaptically and not at synapses (227). Interestingly, in the cerebellum pha-\nsic and tonic GABAA receptor mediated inhibition has been observed and this has \nbeen attributed to synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors respectively (22, 23). \nFurthermore, in addition to immunocytochemical studies that show γ2 and δ subunits \nbeing respectively targeted to synaptic and extrasynaptic sites, electrophysiological \nstudies have confirmed that the γ2 subunit mediates phasic inhibition whereas the δ \nsubunit plays a role in mediating tonic inhibition (23, 24, 206). In agreement with \nthis γ2 subunit GABAA receptor knockout (KO) experiments have demonstrated the \ncritical role of the γ2 subunit in mediating the synaptic targeting of GABAA receptors \nwhich is critical for correct animal behavior (2, 47, 61). Overall, it is proposed based \non work from immunofluorescent, EM, functional and gene deletion studies, that α1, \nα2 or α3 subunits, co assembled with the γ2 subunit and β subunit variants, are the \nmajor receptor subtypes localized to inhibitory synapses and contributing to phasic \ninhibition (64). In contrast, α5 subunit containing receptors assembled with the γ2 \nsubunit and β subunit variants, and α4 or α6 subunits co assembled with the δ subunit \nand β subunit variants are primarily localized extrasynaptically and mediate tonic inhi-\nbition (29, 64). Recently it has been demonstrated that in some cell types such as hip-\npocampal interneurons, the α1 subunit may also assemble with the δ subunit and β \nsubunit variants to form extrasynaptic receptors mediating tonic inhibition suggesting \nthat novel GABAA receptor subunit partnerships may yet be identified (76)."}

Schematic representation of a central inhibitory terminal.  \nThe specification and validation of inhibitory synapses and the correct apposition of \ninhibitory presynaptic terminals with inhibitory postsynaptic domains is thought to \nbe determined in part by the co-ordinated action of adhesion molecules including \ncadherins, the neurexin-neuroligin 2 complex and the dystroglycan complex. Inhibi-\ntory neurotransmitter receptors (GABAA and glycine) are confined to these inhibi-\ntory specializations by scaffold molecules, most notably gephyrin, which can form a \nsub-synaptic clustered lattice important for synaptic receptor retention. Either di-\nrectly or via intermediate binding partners, gephyrin can interact with cytoskeletal \nelements including tubulin and actin. The dystroglycan complex can interact with \ncytoplasmic binding partners including dystrobrevin and S-SCAM, which may also \nplay a role in regulating receptor clustering and trafficking and furthermore, may \nalso facilitate the co-clustering of both neurexin-neuroligin 2 and neurexin-\ndystrolgycan complexes. \nSpecific mechanisms must exist to specify the formation and maturation of synapses \nand the correct apposition of presynaptic terminals with postsynaptic domains con-\ntaining the correct cognate neurotransmitter receptors. In addition mechanisms must \nexist to direct and retain inhibitory receptors from intracellular or extrasynaptic  \ncompartments within the inhibitory postsynaptic apparatus.

{"text": "===== Page 12 =====\n632 \nI.L. Arancibia-Carcamo et al. \n \n9.1 A Critical Role for Gephyrin in the Molecular Organization of \nInhibitory Synaptic Domains \nOne of the first proteins to be found enriched at inhibitory synapses is the ubiqui-\ntously expressed 93 kDa protein gephyrin (221). Initially isolated as a protein co-\npurifying with glycine receptors from rat spinal cord (175), gephyrin was found to be \npresent in front of GABAergic terminal boutons (220) and was then demonstrated to \nplay a central role in the organization of GABAergic synapses. Immunofluorescence \nand EM studies have conclusively shown that gephyrin is enriched at inhibitory \nGABAergic and glycinergic synapses (reviewed in (162)). However, several key \ndifferences remain between gephyrin regulation of glycinergic and GABAergic syn-\napses. Firstly, whereas a direct interaction between gephyrin and glycine receptors \nhas been demonstrated between a 14 residue stretch in the glycine receptor β-subunit \nloop and gephyrin (151), the exact molecular mechanism whereby gephyrin is re-\ncruited to GABAA receptors and whether or not gephyrin can interact either directly \nor indirectly via a bridging molecule with GABAA receptors remains unclear. Fur-\nthermore, in contrast to glycine receptor clustering, not all GABAA receptor subtypes \nare clustered by gephyrin dependent mechanisms. However, gephyrin and γ2 subunit \nGABAA receptor mouse knockout experiments have emphasized the relationship \nbetween GABA receptor clustering and gephyrin (see below) (2, 61). \n9.2 Gephyrin Structure and Lattice Formation \nSeveral recent biochemical and structural studies have led to a model for the ability \nof gephyrin to forms clusters at inhibitory postsynaptic domains (7, 125). Gephyrin \nhas a modular structure consisting of an N-terminal G-domain linked by a 170 resi-\ndue central region to a C-terminal E-domain (99, 204). This structure originates from \nthe fusion of two genes of bacterial origin MogA and Moe, important for the biosyn-\nthesis of molybdenum co-factor and homologous to gephyrin G- and E-domains \nrespectively (3, 204, 236). Structural and biochemical data have revealed that the \ngephyrin N-terminal G-domain and the C-terminal E-domain can form trimers and \ndimers respectively (99, 203), suggesting a mechanism for the formation of a hex-\nagonal submembrane lattice onto which inhibitory receptors can be sequestered  \n(Fig. 3). In agreement with this, experiments using Blue Native-PAGE of affinity \npurified gephyrin expressed in Xenopus oocytes found gephyrin to run as hexamers, \npossibly dimers of trimers, in addition to some higher order complexes (188). In \ncontrast oligomerization mutants no longer formed hexamers in this expression sys-\ntem. The gephyrin hexamers may be a natural intermediate of gephyrin lattice forma-\ntion. Initial structural and mapping studies have located the GlyR β-loop binding to \nthe C-terminal E-domain of gephyrin (89, 193). More recently atomic resolution \nstructural data define the GlyR β-loop as binding to each E-domain monomer in a \npocket adjacent to the dimer interface. Complementary mutagenesis experiments \nreveal that β-loop binding is mediated by a hydrophobic interaction between \nphenylalanine 330 of gephyrin and two residues of the glycine receptor β-loop \n(phenylalanine 398, isoleucine 400) that are essential for this interaction. In contrast, \nthe mechanisms of gephyrin recruitment to GABAA receptors or GABAA receptor \nrecruitment to gephyrin, remain unknown."}

Gephyrin structure and binding partners.  \n(a) Domain and splicing map of gephyrin.

This domain is also responsible for the interaction of gephyrin with other binding \npartners such as collybistin, profilin and VASP.

On the other hand, gephyrin splicing within its central domain affects its \nability to interact with various gephyrin associated proteins (102). Of greatest inter-\nest, splicing also regulates the ability of gephyrin to form oligomers. Two groups"}
{"text": "===== Page 14 =====\n634 \nI.L. Arancibia-Carcamo et al. \n \nhave recently demonstrated that insertion of a gephyrin splice cassette C5’ into the \ngephyrin N-terminal G-domain interferes with N-terminal trimerization (7, 188). \n \nSeveral studies (e.g. (7)) have now demonstrated that interfering with gephyrin \ndimerization and trimerization inhibits gephyrin’s ability to form clusters in neurons. \nGephyrin expression constructs containing substitutions at oligomerization interfaces \nhave confirmed the essential role of G- and E-domains for clustering gephyrin at \nsynapses. Furthermore, expression of recombinant gephyrin G- or E- domains, or \ndimerization or trimerization defective gephyrin mutants, disrupts gephyrin clusters \nin cultured neurons. Furthermore this causes disruption of both GABAA receptor and \nglycine receptor clusters at inhibitory postsynaptic sites supporting a critical role of \ngephyrin lattice formation in the maintenance of inhibitory postsynaptic domains. \n9.3 Gephyrin Associated Proteins  \nSeveral gephyrin interacting partners have been identified that tie gephyrin function-\nally to cytoskeletal transport and anchoring processes (Fig. 3). Key gephyrin associ-\nated proteins identified so far include: the cdc42 guanylate exchange factor (GEF) \ncollybistin (100), tubulin (178), the motor protein component dynein light chain \n(Dlc) (71), Mena/VASP (75), profilin (143) and RAFT (187). Gephyrin binding to \ntubulin provides a physical linkage between gephyrin and microtubules. Gephyrin \nalso interacts directly with the actin monomer binding proteins profilin I and profilin \nII, and the actin microfilament adaptors Mena and VASP, providing a link to the \nactin cytoskeleton (5, 75, 143). Gephyrin can form complexes with profilin and \nMena dependent on the gephyrin E-domain and competes with G-actin and phos-\npholipids for the same binding region on profilin (75). In cell lines or cultured hippo-\ncampal neurons, profilin and Mena/VASP partially colocalize with inhibitory synap-\ntic markers and gephyrin clusters and may contribute to a link between gephyrin \ndependent receptor clustering mechanisms and the microfilament system to regulate \nthe dynamics of receptor localization at inhibitory synapses (163). \n \nOf particular interest was the identification by yeast two-hybrid screening of a \ndirect interaction of gephyrin with guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) colly-\nbistin (hPEM-2 in humans), which can accelerate the GDP-GTP exchange on small \nGTPases (100). Collybistin is a member of the Dbl family of GEFs which are com-\nposed of tandem Dbl-homology (DH) and pleckstrin-homology (PH) domains and \nare specific for the Rho GTPases (Cdc42, Rac and Rho and their isoforms) which \ncan regulate, among other processes, the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. \nCollybistin exists in a number of splice variants with three alternatively spliced C-\nterminal isoforms combined with presence or absence of an N-terminal SH3 domain. \nCollybistin 2 (the shortest version) recruits gephyrin to submembranous clusters \nwhich recruit glycine receptors (89, 100). Collybistin is a selective GEF for the \nGTPase Cdc42, which can regulate the reorganization of actin filaments. Since \ngephyrin can interact with components of the cytoskeleton, collybistin may regulate \ngephyrin function and receptor clustering by controlling local actin dynamics around \nthe gephyrin lattice. Recent structural and biochemical results indicate that gephyrin \nbinding has an inhibitory function on collybistin GEF activity (235). Collybistin may \ntherefore play a role in terminating Cdc42 signaling during the initial stages of in-"}
{"text": "===== Page 15 =====\nMolecular Organization of the Postsynaptic Membrane at Inhibitory Synapses\n635\n \n \n \nhibitory synapse formation. In addition to control of cytoskeletal dynamics, the abil-\nity of gephyrin to associate with mTOR/RAFT1 (rapamycin and FKB12 target pro-\ntein) suggests that gephyrin may also be able to participate in translational control at \nthe synapse (187). This is in line with the demonstration that glycine receptor alpha \nsubunit mRNAs can be found localized in the vicinity of the postsynaptic membrane \n(183) where a protein synthesis machinery is also present (74). \n \nGephyrin also interacts with dynein light chain 1 (also known as dynein light \nchain 8) and its homologue dynein light chain 2 (71). Dynein light chain interacts \nwith a 63 amino acid binding domain within the central linker region of gephyrin and \nthis interaction allows the recruitment of gephyrin and glycine receptors to dynein \nmotor complexes for retrograde transport in neurons (71, 140). Whether gephyrin \ncan similarly recruit GABAA receptor complexes to dynein motors remains un-\nknown. \n9.4 Functional Role of Gephyrin in Regulating the Formation and \nMaintenance of Inhibitory Glycinergic and GABAergic Synapses \nEvidence supports a role for gephyrin in regulating the formation of inhibitory syn-\napses and the recruitment of receptors to these postsynaptic specializations. Loss of \nfunction studies using antisense or gephyrin KO mice (104) (65, 104, 132) demon-\nstrated that this protein is essential for the synaptic recruitment and/or clustering of \nall synaptic glycine receptors, both in the brain and spinal cord. Furthermore, gephy-\nrin knockout mice die soon after birth, exhibiting a rigid hyperextended posture \nsimilar to animals treated with strychnine. In contrast the consequences of gephyrin \ndepletion on the function of GABAergic synapses have remained more controversial. \nAntisense treatment against gephyrin in cultured hippocampal neurons causes a \ndramatic reduction in the density of clusters for GABAA receptor α2 and γ2 subunits \n(61). Similarly RNAi mediated gephyrin knockdown resulted in a significant reduc-\ntion but did not completely abolish the clustering of α2 and γ2 containing GABAA \nreceptors (94). A complete absence of α2 and γ2 containing clusters in hippocampal \ncultures from gephyrin knockout mice was reported in one study (117). In contrast \nother studies have shown that, whereas surface and synaptic clusters of α2 and γ2 \nsubunit containing GABAA receptors are significantly reduced, many clusters could \nstill be detected, and furthermore α1 subunit clusters remain unaffected in gephyrin \nknockout neurons (116, 131, 132). Therefore in most neuronal types, gephyrin is not \nessential for GABAA receptor clustering but does appear to contribute to the aggre-\ngation of α2, α3 and γ2 but not α1 or α5 subunits. In agreement with this, GABAer-\ngic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs), although reduced in ampli-\ntude, are present in hippocampal neurons lacking gephyrin, suggesting that gephyrin \nindependent mechanisms of GABAA receptor clustering exist and may compensate \nduring inhibitory synapse development in the absence of gephyrin (132).  \n \nIntriguingly, the clustering of gephyrin at GABAergic synapses is dependent on \nGABAA receptors. Gephyrin does not form clusters in the absence of GABAA recep-\ntors in cultured neurons and gephyrin clustering is disrupted in vivo\nGABAA receptor α1, α3 and γ2 subunit knockout mice (2, 61, 125, 207). For exam-\nple, in α3 knockout neurons of the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, the absence of \n in neurons from"}
{"text": "===== Page 16 =====\n636 \nI.L. Arancibia-Carcamo et al. \n \nGABAA receptors results in gephyrin forming large intracellular aggregates rather \nthan synaptic clusters (207). Similarly in α1 knockout mice gephyrin clustering at \npostsynaptic sites is disrupted, leading to intracellular aggregates (125). In agreement \nwith these results, artificial aggregation of GABAA receptors induces co-clustering \nof gephyrin (132). These results suggest that clustered synaptic GABAA receptors \nmay recruit gephyrin to synapses. Interestingly, the glycinergic or GABAergic mixed \nphenotype of the presynaptic element determines the postsynaptic accumulation of \nspecific cognate receptors but not of gephyrin and the postsynaptic accumulation of \ngephyrin alone cannot account for the formation of glycine receptor rich microdo-\nmains (130). A developmental analysis revealed that, at mixed glycine-GABAergic \nsynapses, GABAA receptors formed clusters first, followed by gephyrin and then by \nglycine receptors (57). Gephyrin may then form a submembranous lattice that could \nserve to further stabilize newly recruited GABAA receptors at these sites. In agree-\nment with this notion, RNAi mediated gephyrin knockdown combined with fluores-\ncence imaging of GFP-labeled GABAA receptors found that gephyrin regulates \nGABAA receptor cell surface dynamics by reducing the mobility of GABAA receptor \nclusters (94). This would provide a feedback loop to promote and validate the forma-\ntion of inhibitory postsynaptic specializations. \n9.5 GRIP1 \nThe glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) is one of the few proteins to be \nfound enriched at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (52, 53). GRIP1 and its \nhomologue GRIP2 are 7 PDZ domain containing proteins originally identified to \ninteract with glutamate receptors. In addition, a second GRIP family member, ABP \n(for AMPA receptor binding protein) is a shorter splice variant derived from the \nsame gene as GRIP2 but lacking the seventh PDZ domain. GRIP1 is encoded by a \nseparate gene which can produce several GRIP1 isoforms by alternative splicing \n(GRIP1a, GRIP1b and GRIP1c4-7) (31, 32). GRIP1 associates with several proteins \nincluding the C-termini of AMPA receptor GluR2/3 and 4c subunits, ephrins and \nEph receptors, the proteoglycan NG2, the putative extracellular matrix (ECM) pro-\ntein Fraser syndrome protein (Fras1), GRASPs (for GRIP associated proteins) and \nliprin α family members (32, 52, 53, 205, 213, 233, 237). This suggests that GRIP \nmay be important for regulating the function of other proteins in addition to gluta-\nmate receptors and has a more general role in membrane transport processes. In \naddition GRIP1 associates with several signaling molecules and proteins implicated \nin cytoskeletal transport processes including kinesin motor proteins and the micro-\ntubule associated protein GABARAP. Surprisingly, several groups have reported that \nGRIP1 associates with the postsynaptic domains of inhibitory synapses. Im-\nmunofluorescence experiments in cultured neurons and brain slices reveal that \nGRIP-1 and the 4-PDZ domain splice form GRIP-1c (PDZ 4-7) co-localize with \nseveral inhibitory postsynaptic markers such as gephyrin and GABAA receptors (27, \n32, 53, 135) (234). Furthermore, using immunoelectron microscopy, GRIP1 was \nfound to localize at inhibitory synapses in intact brain where it localizes to both the \npresynaptic and postsynaptic side of inhibitory synapses (31). The role of GRIP-1 at \ninhibitory synapses remains unknown, although its ability to interact with cytoskeletal"}

Several cell ad-\nhesion molecules such as cadherins (10), the dystroglycan complex and neur-\nexin/neuroligin complexes have been localized to inhibitory synapses and proposed \nto play an important role in their formation and maintenance (Fig. 2). \n10.1 Neurexins and Neuroligins: Key Molecules for the Induction \nThe neuroligins, and their presynaptic counterparts neurexins, have emerged as key \ntrans-synaptic organizing molecules at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. \nNeurexins were originally identified as a binding partner for the black widow spider \nvenom α-latrotoxin (223). Using biochemical techniques, a number of endogenous \nneurexin binding partners were then identified such as neuroligins, neurexophilins \nand dystroglycan (46). The most well characterized neurexin complex is that with \nneuroligins. Neurexins and neuroligins form cell adhesion complexes that span the \nsynaptic cleft, with neurexins localized on the presynaptic side and the neuroligins \nlocated in the postsynaptic domain (46) (see Chapter by El-Husseini, this volume). A \nkey role of the neurexin/neuroligin complex for generating synaptic connections \nbecame clear when it was shown that neuroligins expressed in a human embryonic \nkidney (HEK) cell line could induce glutamatergic axons from co-cultured neurons \nto form functional release sites onto these non-neuronal cells (191). In a complemen-\ntary set of co-culture experiments, it was also found that when neurexins were ex-\npressed alone on non-neuronal cells they could trigger postsynaptic differentiation \nand clustering of postsynaptic receptors and scaffolds in contacting dendrites (79). \n \nNeurexins are cell surface proteins that contain a large extracellular N-terminal \ndomain, transmembrane region and short intracellular C-terminus. There are three \nvertebrate genes for Neurexins that contain two independent promoters, which allow \nthe formation of either α- or (the shorter) β-neurexins. Neurexins can be alternatively \nspliced at five different sites allowing for the expression of hundreds of alternatively \nspliced isoforms (46). The N-terminal domain of α-neurexins contains six laminin-\nneurexin-sex hormone-binding globulin (LNS) domains interspersed by three EGF-\nlike regions whereas β-neurexins contain only a single LNS domain. Neurexins have \nrelatively short intracellular domains which bind to synaptotagmin and the PDZ \ndomains of CASK, syntenin and Mint linking them to synaptic vesicles and the vesi-\ncle fusion machinery (46). Extracellularly, α- and β-neurexins bind to neuroligins, \nof Inhibitory Synapses \n \nand trafficking proteins suggest that it may be involved in the regulation of GABAA \nreceptor function or trafficking (105)."}

Arancibia-Carcamo et al. \n \nwhich are concentrated in the postsynaptic domains of inhibitory and excitatory \nsynapses.  \n \nThere are believed to be at least four main neuroligin isoforms in mammals \n(NLGN1-NLGN4). Neuroligins comprise a large extracellular domain similar in \nstructure to that of acetylcholinesterase (but lacking cholinesterase activity), which \ninteracts with neurexins. In addition, neuroligins can homo-multimerise through their \nAChE-like domain. In contrast to their large extracellular domains, the intracellular \ndomains of neuroligins are relatively short and terminate with a PDZ domain ligand. \nThe PDZ domain ligand is believed to link them to several PDZ domain containing \npostsynaptic proteins such as PSD-95 and S-SCAM family members in addition to \nShank, PICK1, GOPC and SPAR (46, 152). The identification of protein interactions \nbetween neuroligins and components of the excitatory postsynaptic scaffold sug-\ngested a mechanism allowing them to co-ordinate the formation of excitatory syn-\napses. However, the importance of neuroligins for the formation of inhibitory syn-\napses was suggested when it was reported that neuroligin-2 is enriched at inhibitory \n(but not excitatory) synapses (225). \n \nSubstantial evidence has now accumulated to support the ability of neurexin-\nneuroligin complexes to trigger presynaptic/postsynaptic differentiation and/or stabi-\nlization of inhibitory synapses. Graf et al. (2004) showed that neurexin presented \nalone on the surface of HEK cells or on beads is sufficient to induce the localized \nclustering of glutamatergic and GABAergic postsynaptic receptors and scaffolds \n(79). They also went on to demonstrate that, whereas neuroligins-1, -3 and -4 local-\nize to excitatory postsynaptic domains, neuroligin-2 localizes primarily to inhibitory \nsynapses supporting the idea that neuroligin-2 is a key factor for the differentiation \nof inhibitory synapses. In agreement with this, aggregating neuroligins-1, -3 and -4 \nresulted in clustering of only excitatory postsynaptic components, whereas aggregat-\ning neuroligin-2 resulted in redistribution of both excitatory and inhibitory postsy-\nnaptic proteins. Although it is now well established that neuroligin-2 can selectively \nlink gephyrin and GABAA receptors, the mechanisms of this linkage remain unclear. \nImportantly, the presynaptic contacts induced by neuroligins appear to exhibit many \nof the release characteristics of normal synapses. This has most recently been ele-\ngantly demonstrated by experiments showing that HEK cells co-expressing  \nneuroligins with either AMPA receptors or GABAA receptors and co-cultured with \nneurons produce miniature excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic like currents \n(mIPSCs or mEPSCs) (54, 70). \n \nAdditional functional evidence for a critical role of neuroligins comes from RNA \ninterference studies which showed that knockdown of neuroligins-1, -3 in hippocam-\npal cultures reduced the density of inhibitory and excitatory synapses identified by \nimmunofluorescence with inhibitory and excitatory presynaptic markers (38). Fur-\nthermore knockdown also resulted in a large reduction in the amplitude and fre-\nquency of mIPSCs. The synaptogenic activity of neurexins/neuroligins appears to be \nin part dependent on alternative splicing in splice site B of the neuroligin AChE-\ndomain and at site 4 in β-neurexins.

The DGC \nis a large complex containing at least 10 proteins (e.g. dystrophin, dystroglycan, \nutrophin, syntrophins, sarcoglycans and dystrobrevins) (12). Dystroglycan is a major \ncomponent of the DGC and is composed of an extracellular α-subunit and trans-\nmembrane β-subunit, both derived from proteolytic cleavage of a single pre-cursor \nprotein, and which remain bound to each other on the cell surface. Through its ex-\ntracellular domain dystroglycan binds matrix proteins agrin, laminin and perlcan and \nthe presynaptic proteins neurexins. Through its intracellular domain dystroglycan \nbinds dystrophin (a large > 400 kDa cytoskeletal protein of the α-actinin/β-spectrin \nfamily) and utrophin (12). Dystrophin interacts directly with dystrobrevins, syntro-\nphin and the actin cytoskeleton. Mutations in dystrophin result in Duchene and \nBecker muscular dystrophies in humans. Similarly, mutations in many of the genes \nencoding components of the DGC (e.g. α-, β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan, α-dystrobrevin, \nlaminin α2, and four enzymes that glycosylate dystroglycan) lead to muscular dys-\ntrophies in human or animal models (12). \n \ncontaining splice insert B selectively promote differentiation of glutamatergic syn-\napses (19, 39, 46). \n \nIt had generally been assumed that postsynaptic neuroligins interact trans-\nsynaptically with presynaptic neurexins. Using immunoelectron microscopy, it was \nrevealed that in addition to being localized pre-synaptically, neurexins were also \nfound to be abundantly expressed in the postsynaptic density suggesting that cis-\nneurexin-neuroligin complexes may also form postsynaptically (214). Furthermore \ncis-expression of recombinant neurexin was found to block the synaptogenic activity \nof neuroligin-1. Postsynaptic cis-interactions between neuroligins and neurexins \ncould provide a novel mechanism for silencing the activity of trans-synaptic com-\nplexes. Whether postsynaptic expression of neurexins can also mediate an inhibitory \neffect on synaptogenic activity of neuroligin-2 at inhibitory synapses remains un-\nclear. However, these recent findings suggest a mechanism for silencing neuroligin \nfunction to regulate synapse formation or disassembly (214). \n \nThe increase in synapse formation observed in vitro by neuroligins and neurexins \nhas been proposed to be due to the synaptogenic activity promoting the differentia-\ntion of new synapses. In contrast, in vivo although neuroligin function appears essen-\ntial for synaptic function and animal survival it does not appear to be required for \nsynapse formation per se (46, 224). Recent work reconciling these apparently con-\ntradictory observations suggests that rather than inducing the differentiation of new \nsynapses, neurexin/neuroligin complexes act to specify and validate already formed \nsynapses by an activity-dependent mechanism (42). In this model, activity-dependent \npostsynaptic signaling mechanisms converge on either neuroligin-1 or neuroligin-2 \nto validate the formation of excitatory versus inhibitory synapses, respectively (42)."}
{"text": "===== Page 20 =====\n640 \nI.L. Arancibia-Carcamo et al. \n \n \nA number of studies support a role for the DGC at inhibitory synapses (26, 119, \n120, 131). Several groups have localized components of the DGC (including α- \nand β-dystroglycan, long and short forms of dystrophin, syntrophin and α- and β-\ndystrobrevin) to a subset of inhibitory synapses on neuronal somata and dendrites \n(131). Although the role of the DGC at inhibitory synapses remains unclear, the \ndemonstration that dystrophin mutant mdx mice or DGC knockout mice have a \nlarge reduction in GABAA receptor clusters (but not gephyrin) has lead to the pro-\nposal that the DGC may be important for regulating the stability of GABAA recep-\ntors at DGC containing synapses (120). More recently, cerebellar Purkinje cells \nfrom double α- and β-dystrobrevin knockout mice have been found to have de-\npleted synaptic dystrophin levels, reduced GABAA receptor clusters and altered \nsensorimotor behaviors similar to those seen in dystrophin-deficient (mdx) mice \nsuggesting that other DGC components in addition to dystrophin can affect inhibi-\ntory synaptic structure (78). In addition, observations of the critical requirement \nfor the DGC for the proper maturation and function of a subset of inhibitory cere-\nbellar synapses suggests that the motor deficits observed in muscular dystrophy \npatients may reflect not only peripheral dysfunctions but in addition alterations of \nsynaptic inhibition in the CNS (78). \n \nThe major extracellular matrix components that bind the DGC in non-neuronal \ncells (laminin, perlecan, collagen and agrin) are not as abundant in brain and the \nextracellular space between neurons in adult brain lacks a basal lamina. This sug-\ngests that other neuro-specific ligands of the DGC may exist. In agreement with \nthis it has been demonstrated that in brain, the DGC forms a stoichiometric com-\nplex with the presynaptic neurexins (210). Both α- and β-neurexin can interact \nwith dystroglycan via the second and sixth LNS domain of α-neurexin and the \nsingle LNS domain in β-neurexin, suggesting that they may be the main neuronal \nDGC receptors. Intriguingly, in a hippocampal cell culture model of inhibitory \nsynapse formation, gephyrin and GABAARs can be mistargeted to glutamatergic \nterminals when there is insufficient inhibitory presynaptic terminal innervation \n(41, 184, 208). In contrast, components of the DGC are not mistargeted to gluta-\nmatergic synapses due to reduced inhibitory presynaptic input or in the absence of \nGABAA receptor γ2 subunits suggesting independent targeting mechanisms which \nmay rely on interaction with specific presynaptic neurexins present at inhibitory \nsynapses (26, 210). Recently it has been demonstrated that the synaptic scaffolding \nmolecule S-SCAM can be found localized to inhibitory synapses (211). S-SCAM \ncontains 5 or 6 PDZ domains, a guanylate kinase domain and two WW domains. \nS-SCAM can interact with β-dystroglycan via its WW domains and neuroligin-2 \nvia its WW domains and second PDZ domain. Furthermore, S-SCAM, β-\ndystroglycan and neuroligin-2 form a tripartite complex \nimmunoprecipitate from rat brain and partially co-localize in rat hippocampal \nneurons.

The number of surface and synaptic GABA and glycine receptors is deter-\nmined by rates of receptor cycling between surface and intracellular compartments \nand the exchange of synaptic and extrasynaptic surface receptors. This is determined \nby association with receptor associated proteins that regulates exocytosis and endo-\ncytosis of plasma membrane receptors and also by the relationship of receptors with \ntheir associated scaffold proteins. \n11.1 GABAA Receptor Associated Proteins in Receptor Transport, \nLocalization, and Internalization \nGiven the selective cellular localization of GABAA receptors and glycine receptors, it \nis clear that the trafficking, targeting and clustering of these receptors is a tightly \ncontrolled and regulated process. A number of GABAA receptor associated proteins \nthat interact directly with GABAA receptor intracellular domains have been recently \nimplicated in receptor membrane trafficking and localization (Fig. 4). Several of \nthese proteins are not highly enriched at inhibitory synapses, but rather are thought to \nbe important for receptor transport and maturation throughout the secretory pathway \n(see Chapter by Hanus and Ehlers, this volume). GABAA receptor α- and β-subunits \nare components of essentially all native GABAA receptors and play key roles in \ncontrolling receptor trafficking. Several proteins interact with the intracellular do-\nmains of these receptors. The ubiquitin related protein Plic-1 interacts with GABAA \nreceptor α- and β-subunits (8). Plic-1 is a 67 kDa protein with a ubiquitin like N-\nterminal (UBL) domain and a carboxy-terminal ubiquitin associated domain (UBA) \n(113). Plic proteins regulate ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation in the protea-\nsome by their ability to bind ubiquitin ligases and components of the proteasome \n(113) (see Chapter by Helton and Ehlers, this volume). Yeast two hybrid screens and \nGST affinity purification assays have shown that Plic-1 interacts with all α (1–6) and \nβ (1–3) subunits of GABAA receptors indicating that Plic-1 function may be relevant \nfor the majority of GABAA receptor subtypes expressed in the brain (8). Im-\nmunofluorescence studies found Plic-1 to be mainly expressed in intracellular com-\npartments and not at synapses (8). Significantly, a number of GABAA receptors \ncolocalize with Plic-1 beneath the plasma membrane at subsynaptic membranes (8). \nInterestingly binding to the intracellular loops of α and β subunits is mediated by the \nUBA domain of Plic-1 and functional studies in non-neuronal HEK293 cells and \nhippocampal brain slices revealed that blockade of the interaction between Plic-1 and \nGABAA receptors results in reduced receptor cell surface expression (8). Consistent \nwith these results, overexpression of Plic-1 in recombinant systems results in an \nincrease in surface expressed GABAA receptors without affecting internalization \nrates (8). Plic-1 may thus act to modulate GABAA receptor cell surface numbers by \ninhibiting receptor degradation in the proteasome, providing initial evidence that \nGABAA receptor function and synaptic receptor number may be regulated by ubiq-"}

In addition the ubiquitin like protein Plic-1 is localized in intracellular com-\npartments where it binds α and β subunits. This interaction is thought to regulate \nmembrane targeting by preventing degradation in the proteasome. GABAA receptors \ninserted at extrasynaptic sites can diffuse along the plasma membrane into postsy-\nnaptic sites where they are stabilized by an undefined interaction with the scaffolding \nprotein gephyrin. GABAA receptors are internalized via clathrin mediated pathway, \nwhere GABAA receptors move out of synaptic sites and are recruited to clathrin pits \nby the association of β and γ subunits with the clathrin adaptor protein AP2. The \nlarge GTPase dynamin releases the clathrin-coated vesicle which delivers the inter-\nnalized receptor to the endosomal system. In early endosomes, GABAA receptors can \nbe targeted for degradation or recycle back to the plasma membrane, a process that is \nmediated by an interaction with the Huntingtin associated protein HAP1."}

BIG2 is mainly found concentrated in the \ntrans Golgi network although a small proportion is found in vesicle-like structures \nalong dendrites and near post-synaptic sites (33). BIG2 has previously been impli-\ncated in vesicular transport by its ability to catalyse the GDP-GTP exchange on ARF \nGTPases. Interestingly, coexpression of BIG2 with the GABAA receptor β3 subunit \nresults in an increase in β3 exit from the ER suggesting that BIG2 is involved in the \npost-Golgi vesicular trafficking of GABAA receptors (33). Other GABAA receptor β-\nsubunit interacting proteins that have been identified include GRIF-1 (6) and gC1qR \n(190) whereas radixin has been shown to interact with receptor α-subunits (136). \nNeither GRIF-1 nor gC1qR have been found enriched at synapses and their func-\ntional significance remains to be established. The ERM family member radixin was \nidentified by yeast two hybrid to interact with extrasynaptic GABAA receptor α5 \nsubunits. Radixin’s ability to bind to actin suggests that it may act to link GABAA \nreceptors to the actin cytoskeleton and to the formation of extrasynaptic α5 subunit \ncontaining GABAA receptors (136). \n \nAs outlined above, the GABAA receptor γ2 subunit is essential for the synaptic \nlocalization, clustering and function of GABAA receptors. Several yeast two hybrid \nscreens using the γ2 subunit have identified γ2 subunit associated proteins that are \nimportant for the selective synaptic targeting mediated by this subunit. The first to be \nidentified was the 17 kDa GABAA receptor associated protein (GABARAP), which \nparticipates in the trafficking of GABAA receptors (226). GABARAP binds γ sub-\ncopy studies revealed that it is not found at inhibitory synapses but instead colocal-\nizes with GABAA receptors in intracellular compartments, namely at the Golgi \ncompartment and subsynaptic cisternae (109, 226). GABARAP is a member of a \nfamily of homologous small microtubule binding proteins that also includes \nGABARAP like1 (GBRL1, GEC1), GABARAP like 2 (GBRL2, GATE-16) and the \nlight chain-3A and B (LC3A, LC3B) subunits of MAP-1A and 1B (226). \nGABARAP is able to bind microtubules as well as N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor \n(NSF) supporting a role for GABARAP in GABAA receptor intracellular transport \n(109, 169, 226). Recent immunochemical and electrophysiological studies have \nprovided evidence to support a functional role for GABARAP in the trafficking of \nGABAA receptors to the plasma membrane and in inhibitory synaptic plasticity. \nCoexpression of GABARAP and GABAA receptors in COS-7 cells and neurons \nresults in an increase in the levels of GABAA receptors expressed at the cell surface \nas well as an increase of GABA mediated currents in oocytes (36, 37, 129). Several \nGABARAP associated proteins have been identified that may also be important for \nGABAA receptor function. Although GABARAP itself is not localized to inhibitory \nstrated that two other proteins localized to inhibitory postsynaptic domains, GRIP-1 \nand gephyrin interact with GABARAP, suggesting that GABARAP may be impor-\ntant for the transport of other components of the inhibitory postsynaptic domain in \naddition to GABAA receptors (105, 118).

Interestingly \nPRIP-1 knockout mice showed an impairment in GABAA receptor modulation by γ2 \nselective pharmacological agents suggesting that PRIP-1 plays a role in the regula-\ntion of GABAA receptor trafficking by GABARAP ensuring that only mature αβγ \nreceptors are delivered to the plasma membrane (95, 156). Gene deletion studies \nGABAA receptors. However whether this is due to compensation by the other closely \nrelated GABARAP family members remains to be established (170). \n \nIn addition to GABARAP, γ2 subunits have also been identified by yeast two \nhybrid to interact with the Golgi-specific palmitoyl transferase GODZ and to co-\nlocalize with this protein in Golgi compartments (63, 97). The γ2 subunit is the only \nGABAA receptor subunit family member that contains cysteine residues within its \nintracellular domain which have been shown to serve as substrates for palmitoyla-\ntion, a post-translational modification important for correct surface delivery and \nsynaptic targeting of GABAA receptors (63, 97, 185). GODZ is the major palmitoy-\nlating enzyme for GABAA receptors and RNAi mediated knockdown of this protein \ndisrupts the formation of normal whole cell and synaptic inhibitory currents. Palmi-\ntoylation of GABAA receptor γ2 subunits by GODZ (and to a lesser extent by a \nGODZ paralogue, SERZ beta) therefore is important for receptor transport through \nthe Golgi apparatus and the selective formation and normal function of inhibitory \nsynapses (63, 97). Other GABAA receptor subunits, including γ1, γ3, θ, ε and π also \ncontain cysteine residues within their intracellular domains, although whether they \nare substrates for palmitoylation remains to be addressed.  \n \nThe internalization of GABAA receptors from the cell surface by clathrin and \ndynamin dependent mechanisms has also been demonstrated to be an important \nmechanism for regulating surface and synaptic receptor number (108). GABAA re-\nceptors have been found localized to clathrin coated pits and receptor β- and γ- sub-\nunits can interact directly with the clathrin adaptor protein AP2 which facilitates the \nrecruitment of these receptors into the endocytic pathway (107). The interaction of \nGABAA receptor β-subunits with AP2 has been mapped to a phospho-dependent \nbasic amino acid motif that also contains the major site for β-subunit phosphoryla-\ntion (106). Blocking GABAA receptor internalization, by either targeting dynamin \nfunction or by blocking GABAA receptor phospho-dependent interaction with AP2 \ninhibits dopaminergic modulation of inhibitory synapse strength in the striatum sug-\ngesting that signaling dependent alterations in AP2-dependent GABAA receptor \nendocytosis may be a critical mechanism underlying functional modulation of inhibi-\ntion (34). Internalized GABAA receptors can be either targeted for degradation in the \nlysosome or rapidly recycled in a process that is dependent on a direct interaction \n(also identified by yeast two hybrid) of GABAA receptors with the huntingtin associ-\nated protein 1 (HAP1) (110).

It remains to be tested \nwhether any of the identified GABAA receptor associated proteins may also be im-\nportant for glycine receptor function and membrane trafficking (analogous to the \noverlapping role of gephyrin for regulating both these Cys-loop receptors). Interest-\ningly, gephyrin itself has been implicated in receptor transport and trafficking in \naddition to its well characterized role in receptor anchoring at the synapse (60, 86, \n115). Gephyrin associates with the vesicular compartments used for intracellular \ntrafficking of glycine receptors and has also been demonstrated to act as a mediator \nof microtubule-dependent insertion of newly synthesized receptor molecules into the \nplasma membrane (86). It has also been suggested that non-synaptic glycine recep-\ntor/gephyrin complexes can be recruited to microtubules by dynein motors for retro-\ngrade transport along neuronal processes (115), and diffusing extrasynaptic receptors \ncould also bind gephyrin (60). The demonstration of intracellular and extrasynaptic \nglycine receptor/gephyrin complexes suggests a dual function for gephyrin in both \ntrafficking and assembly of postsynaptic scaffolds, as has similarly been suggested \nfor proteins of excitatory synapses (218). Whether gephyrin also plays a role in the \nintracellular transport of GABAA receptors remains to be determined. \n11.3 Diffusional Properties of Cell Surface GABAA Receptors  \nand Glycine Receptors \nLateral diffusion within the plane of the plasma membrane has been demonstrated \nfor both GABAA receptors and glycine receptors. This concept has been extended to \nalmost all excitatory and inhibitory receptors so far studied (see Chapter by Choquet \nand Triller, this volume). The best estimates of inhibitory receptor diffusion rates in \nthe plasma membrane have been derived from single particle tracking (SPT) of gly-\ncine receptors labeled with antibodies to extracellular domains (48, 150). These \nstudies have shown that receptor movements display interspersed periods of high and \nlow diffusion rates in the extrasynaptic and synaptic membrane, respectively. \nWhereas periods of fast diffusion correspond to Brownian movement, those of slow \nmobility result from transient association of glycine receptor with clusters of gephy-\nrin. This association, which reduces diffusion coefficients from up to 0.5 μm2 s-1 to \nless than 0.01 μm2 s–1, imposes a restricted area of exploration (confinement) similar \nto that generated for other proteins by insertion into lipid rafts or by contact with \nprotein fences or obstacles. The fact that glycine receptors are not irreversibly re-\ntained in gephyrin domains suggests that any postsynaptic cluster of gephyrin can \nbehave as donor and/or acceptor for glycine receptors (219). The diffusion rates of \nsynaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors have not yet been directly measured. \nHowever, studies using electrophysiologically tagged GABAA receptors indicate that \nsignificant lateral mobility of GABAA receptors in the plasma membrane also occurs \n(217). Furthermore, combined imaging of GFP-tagged GABAA receptors and RNAi-\nmediated gephyrin knockdown demonstrate that synaptic GABAA receptors have \nlower levels of lateral mobility than their extrasynaptic counterparts and that gephy-"}

The dynamic properties of \ngephyrin interactions with glycine receptors and GABAA receptors is therefore also a \nmeans whereby the number of synaptic receptors can be regulated. Therefore, the \ninteractions between receptors and scaffold molecules is likely to be one of the tar-\ngets for the regulation of receptors at inhibitory synapses during synaptogenesis and \nin synaptic plasticity, or in homeostatic mechanisms setting the level of inhibition. \n12 Concluding Remarks \nSince their initial identification some two decades ago, significant progress has been \nmade in our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the biology of inhibitory \nligand-gated neurotransmitter receptors. Now that all subunits are cloned, we have a \nclear picture of the extent of receptor subunit heterogeneity and their specific re-\ngional and temporal expression profiles in the brain and spinal cord. In addition, a \ndetailed picture of the assembly mechanisms that specify the formation of native \nreceptor subunit combinations and the molecular mechanisms underlying recognition \nof receptors by agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators has emerged. Molecu-\nlar, biochemical, structural and genetic approaches have significantly contributed to \ndeveloping an in depth understanding of the mechanisms that underlie gephyrin-\ndependent recruitment and clustering of GABA and glycine receptors to inhibitory \nsynapses. More recently the critical role of neuroligin family cell adhesion molecules \nfor receptor clustering and the formation and validation of inhibitory synaptic sites \nhas also become apparent. Finally, the importance of intracellular membrane traf-\nficking and surface membrane diffusion of receptors has also emerged as a key \nmechanism for regulating the strength and plasticity of inhibitory synapses. Much \nwork lies ahead in establishing a detailed model of how the varying processes of \nreceptor membrane dynamics and the structural establishment of inhibitory postsy-\nnaptic domains are coordinated, both during development and in the adult, to under-\nlie the formation and synaptic remodeling of inhibitory synapses. Another challenge \nis to understand potential cross talk in the processes regulating excitatory and inhibi-\ntory receptors in a same cell. An in depth understanding of how these processes may \nbe altered could shed new light on neurological diseases where homeostatic regula-\ntion of synaptic inhibition and excitation may be dysregulated. \nReferences \n1. \nAbsalom NL, Lewis TM, Kaplan W, Pierce KD, and Schofield PR.

Although brain pH is tightly controlled, it can be more dynamic than commonly \nappreciated. Physiological fluctuations in extracellular pH provide ample opportunity for \nprotons to influence synaptic signaling. A number of synaptic proteins are modified by \nextracellular pH. Of these, the acid sensing ion channels (ASICs) are gated by extracellular \nprotons and thus they may be particularly well suited to respond to synaptic pH. Here we \nreview extracellular pH changes that accompany neural activity, the synaptic localization of \nASICs, and their known effects on synapse function. Results from manipulating ASICs in \nmice suggest important roles for synaptic ASICs in behavior and neurological disease. \n1 Introduction \nIn general, the brain’s extracellular pH is controlled within a narrow range (1). \nHowever, neural activity causes pH alterations that can vary in location and with \ntime. In addition, disease can generate sustained deviations of physiologic pH. Here, \nwe consider some of the changes in brain pH, and some possible molecular targets, \nfocusing particularly on the acid sensing ion channels.  \n2 Extracellular pH at the Synapse \n2.1 Proton Release During Neurotransmission Lowers Synaptic pH \nVacuolar-H+ATPases pump protons into synaptic vesicles lowering vesicle pH to \n~5.2–5.7 (2–5). The resulting proton gradient energizes neurotransmitter uptake; it \nmay also serve an important signaling role during neurotransmission (Fig. 1a). In \naddition to free protons, at low pH other molecules in the vesicle are protonated, \ncreating a source of releasable protons. Thus, when synaptic vesicles fuse with the \npresynaptic membrane, free protons and protonated acids are released into the \nsynaptic cleft (5). At the release site, pH probably falls very quickly, but the \n \n1 Department of Psychiatry, Neuroscience Program, and Department of Veterans Affairs \nMedical Center, Iowa City, IA,USA, john-wemmie@uiowa.edu \n2 Department of Internal Medicine and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Iowa City,  \nIA 52242, USA, xiangming-zha@uiowa.edu \n3 Departments of Internal Medicine and Molecular Physiology, and Howard Hughes  \nMedical Institute, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA, michael-welsh@uiowa.edu \nJohn A.

{"text": "===== Page 3 =====\nAcid-Sensing Ion Channels (ASICs) and pH in Synapse Physiology\n663\n \n \n \n \nFig. 1. Model of pH fluctuations at the synapse. (a) Synaptic vesicles release protons and \nneurotransmitter (NT) into the synaptic cleft during neurotransmission, which may lower pH \nin the synaptic cleft and modulate pH sensitive channels and other proteins in the pre- and \npost-synaptic membrane. Illustrated are voltage-gated Ca2+-channels (VGCC), NMDA \nreceptors, and ASICs, although other pH sensitive proteins may also be present. Glia, \nmetabolism, and disease processes lower interstitial pH and may also affect synaptic pH and \nphysiology. (b) At lease three transient pH fluctuations may occur at the synapse in response \nto neural activity. Rapid acidification of the cleft (green) may occur with vesicle release and \nprobably lasts milliseconds (ms) or less. A slower alkalosis (blue) has been detected in the \ninterstitial space within tens of milliseconds. An even slower acidosis (red) can follow intense \nneural activity and last for seconds. Improved techniques are needed to better characterize the \ndegree and duration of these pH fluctuations at the synapse. \n2.3 Intense Neural Activity Causes Acidosis \nOn an even slower timescale, intense neural activity produces a wave of acidification \n(Fig. 1b, red waveform)(17). The acidosis occurs within seconds to minutes of \nstimulation and can last for minutes or longer. The degree of acidification and its \nduration appear to depend on the magnitude of neural and metabolic activity. With \nextreme activity, such as during a seizure, interstitial pH can fall well below 7.0; \nraising the chance of both synaptic and extra-synaptic consequences. Metabolic \nmechanisms may contribute to the acidification. Mitochondria take up Ca2+ and \nextrude H+, which in turn can be transported out of the cell (22–24). Lactate is also \nproduced and extruded from cells (17). Glia move acid across the cell membrane (28, \n29), and glial extrusion of lactate may provide an important energy source for active"}
{"text": "===== Page 4 =====\n664 \n \nneurons (30). Increased metabolic activity also produces more CO2, which can be \nrapidly hydrated to HCO3\n– and H+ (31). The physiological consequences of this \nslower acid transient on synaptic transmission are not clear, although the effects are \nlikely to be mainly inhibitory because prolonged acidosis reduces the excitability of \nmost central neurons (26). \n2.4 Neurological Disease can Produce Acidosis  \nExtracellular acidosis is also associated with several neurological diseases. For \nexample, seizures and ischemia are well known to reduce extracellular pH (32–35). \nInflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, and neurodegenerative diseases, \nsuch as Huntington’s disease, impair energy metabolism (36, 37). A resulting \naccumulation of lactate may contribute to acidosis. Interestingly, lactic acid is a \nparticularly potent activator of some ASIC channels (38, 39). Cortical spreading \ndepression, which has been linked to migraine, is also associated with acidosis (32, \n40–42). The acidosis associated with these diseases could readily influence synaptic \nsignaling and neuron function. Future challenges include better elucidating the \nmechanisms underlying the pH alterations, and better understanding of the \nphysiological and pathophysiological consequences of low pH. At the molecular \nlevel, pH-sensitive ion channels may mediate, in large part, the physiological effects \nof acidosis and alkalosis at the synapse. \n3 Acid Sensing Ion Channels (ASICs) \n3.1 ASICs are Well Suited to Respond to Synaptic pH \nJ.A. Wemmie et al. \nA number of synaptic channels are sensitive to pH modulation; including glutamate \nreceptors, GABA-receptors, and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (9–15, 43). These ion \nchannels likely contribute to the physiological effects of fluctuating extracellular pH \n(9, 44). Unlike these other channels, in which pH modulates the response to a ligand \nor voltage, extracellular protons directly gate acid sensing ion channels (ASICs). \nASICs are members of the DEG/ENaC family located at synapses where they may \nplay an important role in synaptic signaling. They are preferentially permeable to \nNa+, but to a lesser extent can conduct other cations (Ca2+, K+, Li+, H+). Thus, ASICs \nmay be well suited to mediate effects of acute pH changes at the synapse.  \n3.2 ASICs are Comprised of Multiple Subunits \nFive ASIC subunits have been identified in mammalian neurons: ASIC1a, -1b, -2a, -\n2b, and -3, (a and b refer to alternatively spliced isoforms). The ASIC subunits \ncombine to form both homomultimeric and heteromultimeric channel complexes \n(45–47). ASIC2b by itself does not form an acid-activated channel, but modifies \ncurrents from other acid-activated subunits (45). The related proteins, ASIC4 and \nBLINaC, share sequence homology with ASICs, but these mammalian proteins have \nnot been shown to produce or modify acid-activated currents (48, 49), although an \nASIC4 homolog in zebrafish is acid-activated (50). The recently determined crystal"}

(b) Trimeric assembly of ASIC/DEG/ENaC family proteins based on the recently \ndetermined crystal structure of chicken ASIC1a minus portions of the amino- and carboxy-\ntermini (55). Individual ASIC1a subunits separated by color. \n3.3 Subunit Composition Dictates Channel Properties \nHomomultimeric ASIC channels vary in activation and desensitization kinetics, and in \npH sensitivity (Fig. 3a). For example, one study reported the half-maximal activation \n(pH0.5) of mouse ASIC subunits as 6.8 (ASIC1a), 6.2 (ASIC1b), 4.9 (ASIC2a), and 6.6 \n(ASIC3) (46). Slightly different values have also been reported (47), which may to \nsome degree reflect differences between species, for example rat ASIC1a may be less \nsensitive (pH0.5 = 6.2–5.8) (47, 56) than mouse ASIC1a (46). Properties can also vary \nconsiderably when subunits are co-expressed to form heteromultimers. For example, \n \nstructure of ASIC1a indicates a unique trimeric assembly (Fig. 2b), which suggests \nthat three subunits are required to form a channel (55). Interestingly, previous studies \nusing electrophysiological, biochemical, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer \napproaches had suggested that 4–9 subunits may combine to form a channel (51–54). \nAlthough the explanation for this difference is unknown, understanding the reason \nfor the discrepancy may give the field insight into the structure and function of these \nchannels."}
{"text": "===== Page 6 =====\n666 \n \nASIC1a homomultimers are permeable to Ca2+, whereas when ASIC1a \nheteromultimerizes with ASIC2a the channel loses Ca2+ permeability (57). Also \nASIC1a, -2a, and -3 heteromultimers desensitize faster than any of the individual \nsubunits alone (Fig. 3) (46, 47). This result indicates that the properties of \nheteromultimeric channels are not simply the sum of properties from the individual \nsubunits. Instead, subunits combine to confer new properties on channels.  \n \n \nFig. 3. Representative acid-evoked currents.

Adapted from (62) \nwith permission. \n3.4 ASIC1a is Critical for Acid-Evoked Currents in the Brain \nIn the brain, ASIC1a, -2a, and -2b are the most prominently expressed subunits (58–61). \nOf these, ASIC1a plays a critical role. Disrupting the ASIC1a gene eliminates \ncurrent evoked by lowering extracellular pH to 5.0 in cultured hippocampal, cortical, \nand amygdala neurons (Fig. 3b). Conversely, disrupting ASIC2 slightly increased pH \n5-evoked current (Fig. 3b) (61) (65–67). In addition, an antagonist specific for \nASIC1a homomultimers (PcTx1, from tarantula venom) inhibited a significant \nproportion of the acid-activated current in cultured hippocampal and cortical neurons \n(60, 67, 68). Thus, much of the acid-activated current in the brain is mediated by \nASIC1a homomultimers and ASIC1a-containing heteromultimers. Consequently, \nrelative to the other ASICs, we currently know the most about ASIC1a in the brain. \nJ.A. Wemmie et al."}
{"text": "===== Page 7 =====\nAcid-Sensing Ion Channels (ASICs) and pH in Synapse Physiology\n667\n \n \n3.5 Fluctuating Brain pH Could Activate or Desensitize ASIC1a \nASIC1a homomultimeric channels are activated as pH falls below 7.2, with a pH0.5 of \nabout 6.8–6.2 (46), (56). This pH sensitivity indicates that ASIC1a is well within the \nrange of acidosis recorded during both physiological and pathophysiological states. \nBecause ASIC currents are largely transient and densensitize quickly, some have \nconsidered them best suited to respond to rapid, transient pH fluctuations such as \nthose thought to occur at the synapse. However, ASICs can also manifest a persistent \ncurrent (45, 46, 69), particularly when activated in the presence of modulatory \nneuropeptides such as NPFF or FMRFamide (70). Moreover, it is possible that ASIC \nactivation could produce sustained effects in second messenger pathways, by raising \nintracellular Ca2+, for example (57, 67, 71). \n \nAnother way that pH regulates ASICs is by desensitization; sustained exposure to \nextracellular protons inactivates the channels. Desensitization begins at pH < 8.0 in \ncultured sensory neurons, with half-maximal desensitization occurring at ~pH 7.2 \n(Fig. 4) (72). Thus, similar to the NMDA receptor, when extracellular pH is held at \n \nFig. 4. Extracellular pH regulates ASIC activation and steady-state inactivation (desensiti-\nzation).

Desensitization curve represents the effects of variations in sustained pH on \nthe subsequent pH 5-evoked current (protocol illustrated in b). Activation curve illustrates \ncurrent evoked by stepping from pH 8 to lower pH levels. Depending on the rate of recovery \nfrom inactivation, the overlapping area beneath the two curves (blue) could provide a window \nof steady state current; evidence from sensory neurons supports this possibility (68). (b) \nDesensitization protocol. Due to channel desensitization, stepping from pH 7 to pH 5 evokes \nsmaller current than stepping from pH 7.4 to pH 5. Similarly, stepping from pH 8 to pH 5 \nevokes larger ASIC current. Adapted from (72) with permission."}
{"text": "===== Page 8 =====\n668 \n \n7.35, a significant proportion of ASIC channels are tonically desensitized. As \nsustained pH becomes more alkaline, desensitization is reduced and transient \nacidosis evokes greater ASIC current. Similarly, as sustained pH falls, \ndesensitization increases and transient acidosis evokes smaller ASIC current. These \ndynamic effects of pH raise the possibility that both acid and alkaline pH could \nregulate ASIC activity in vivo. Moreover, the effects of pH on channel activation and \ndesensitization could generate seemingly paradoxical effects. For example, a \ngeneralized alkaline pH might increase the effect of a transient pH drop during \nneurotransmission. The degree of channel activity may also depend on the speed of \nonset, magnitude, and duration of the pH change, as well as the presence of \nmodulators in the extracellular milieu (such as FMRFamide (70), Zn2+ (73, 74), \nlactate (38), arachidonic acid (75) and others (62)). However, because of this \ncomplexity, it is difficult to precisely predict the amount of ASIC channel activity in \nvivo. \n4 ASIC1a Modulates Synapse Physiology \n4.1 ASIC1a is Localized to Central Synapses \nData from multiple experimental approaches place ASIC1a in dendritic spines. By \nsubcellular fractionation, several studies found that ASIC1a is enriched in the \nsynaptosome-containing brain fraction, suggesting a synaptic distribution (65, 76, \n77). In cultured neurons, immunohistochemistry also detected endogenous and \noverexpressed ASIC1a protein in dendritic spines (65, 71, 76, 77). These studies also \nrevealed ASIC1a to be present at puncta along the dendritic shaft and in the cell body \n(Fig. 5). The improved signal-to-noise ratio obtained from biolistically transfecting \nASIC1a into organotypic hippocampal slices revealed a clearer picture of the \nprotein’s distribution (Fig. 5) (71). Using this method, ASIC1a was visualized in \nalmost all dendritic spines, and was clustered in many spine heads. This localization \npattern places ASIC1a at the postsynaptic membrane, making it a good candidate for \nsensing protons there. \n4.2 ASIC1a is Not Abundant in Axons \nUnlike the somatodendritic distribution of ASIC1a, there is controversy about its \npresence in axons. One study reported ASIC1a immunostaining in axon-like \nbranches of cultured CNS neurons (77). In contrast, others failed to detect \nendogenous ASIC1a in axons (65). In addition, those studies failed to detect \noverexpressed ASIC1a in tau-positive branches of cultured neurons. Moreover, no \ndetectable ASIC1a immunofluorescence was seen in axons from biolistically \ntransfected slice neurons co-labeled with an axonal marker, VAMP2/synaptobrevin \n(71). Together, these data do not rule out the presence of ASIC1a in axons, but \nsuggest it is probably not abundant there. The subcellular distribution of other ASIC \nsubunits in brain neurons remains unclear, although ASIC2 has been suggested to \nlocalize to synapses in the cerebellum (78) and the retina (79). \nJ.A.

Both PICK1 and AKAP150 interact with ASIC1a \nbiochemically and colocalize with ASIC1a in neurons. In addition to these \ninteractions, ASIC1a co-localizes with PSD-95 in dendritic spines (65, 76). This \nobservation is intriguing, although there is currently no biochemical evidence for a \ndirect interaction between ASIC1a and PSD-95. However, other ASIC family \nmembers interact with PSD-95 (83), raising the possibility of an indirect association \nbetween ASIC1a and PSD-95. Functionally, ASIC1a associates with several other \nsynaptic signaling molecules including calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II \n(CaMKII), protein kinase A (PKA) and NMDA receptors (71, 82, 84, 85). In mice, \ndisrupting ASIC1a reduced CaMKII phosphorylation, and overexpressing ASIC1a"}
{"text": "===== Page 10 =====\n670 \n \nincreased CaMKII phosphorylation (71). Similarly, CaMKII-dependent phosphory-\nlation affected ASIC1a function; in response to NMDA receptor activation, CaMKII \nphosphorylated the intracellular C-terminus of human ASIC1a at serines 478 and \n479, which potentiated proton-elicited current and acid-induced neuron damage (84). \nHippocampal slice recordings also suggest a functional interaction between ASIC1a \nand the NMDA receptor (Section 4.5). PKA also phosphorylates mouse ASIC1a at \nserine 478 and disrupts its interaction and co-localization with PICK1 in \nheterologous cells (85). This event is likely to be functionally important, because \nPKA binding with AKAP150 reduced ASIC1a current in heterologous cells and in \ncultured neurons (82). Together, these studies implicate ASIC1a in synaptic \nsignaling networks.  \n \n \nFig. 6. Model of ASICs and interacting molecules at the synapse. ASICs are activated by \nprotons, possibly from pre-synaptic release or other sources. Additional molecules can modify \nacid-evoked ASIC currents, suggesting the possibility of other ligands not yet identified (62). \nUpon activation, ASIC1a increases intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i, largely through voltage-gated \ncalcium channels (VGCCs) and the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores (71). The resulting rise \nin [Ca2+]i initiates downstream signaling events, including CaMKII activation. ASIC1a \nchannel activity may be regulated by interactions with CaMKII, PKA, AKAP150, calcineurin, \nPICK1 and possibly other PDZ-domain proteins (81–85). \n4.4 ASIC1a Confers Acid Sensitivity to Dendritic Spines \nThe presence of ASIC1a at dendritic spines raised the question about its \nphysiological effects there.

(a) Image on left shows a segment \nof an apical dendrite from a neuron cotransfected with ASIC1a and cameleon. Two images on \nthe right show the YFP/CFP fluorescence ratio (blue indicates a low ratio and red indicates a \nhigh ratio) obtained at baseline (pH 7.4) and during acid stimulation (pH 6). Note that pH 6 \nincreased Ca2+ levels in most spines. (b) Acid-induced calcium increase in spines was \nASIC1a-dependent.

{"text": "===== Page 12 =====\n672 \n \n4.5 Disrupting ASIC1a Impairs Synaptic Transmission and Plasticity \nThe pH changes at the synapse, the subcellular distribution of ASIC1a, and its effects \non dendritic [Ca2+], hinted that ASIC1a may play an important role in synaptic \nphysiology and plasticity. Results from ASIC1a knockout mice support this \npossibility. An analysis of synaptic function in hippocampal slices found that long \nterm potentiation (LTP) evoked by Schaffer collateral fiber stimulation, was \nimpaired by the loss of ASIC1a (65). High frequency stimulation (HFS-100 Hz) \nproduced potentiation in wild-type mice lasting beyond 40 minutes. However, within \nthis time frame, potentiation of excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSP) decayed to \nbaseline in ASIC1a knockout slices. Prior to LTP induction, paired-pulse facilitation \nand single evoked EPSPs were normal, suggesting ASIC1a disruption did not impair \npresynaptic vesicle release. However, loss of ASIC1a attenuated the summation of \nEPSPs during the HFS. Interestingly, the NMDA receptor antagonist D-APV \ninhibited EPSP summation in wild-type slices but not in ASIC1a-null slices \nsuggesting that the loss of ASIC1a impaired NMDA-receptor function. These data \nsupport the possible connection between ASIC1a and the NMDA receptor, however \nthe mechanism for the suggested crosstalk remains uncertain. \n4.6 ASICs at Retinal Synapses \nGlutamate release at retinal ribbon synapses is accompanied by acidosis, raising the \npossibility that ASICs could affect neurotransmission in the retina. Recent studies \ninvestigated this possibility and found ASIC1a protein located in the retina near the \nsynaptic cleft in bipolar cells. ASIC1a-antisense RNA and PcTx1 significantly \ndecreased a- and b-electroretinogram measurements, supporting the idea that \nASIC1a contributes to synaptic signaling in the retina (86). While ASIC1a inhibition \ndecreased electroretinogram waves, knocking out ASIC2 increased the a- and b-\nelectroretinogram waves and caused light-induced retinal degeneration (79). Thus, \ndisrupting ASIC2 produced an effect essentially opposite to that of disrupting \nASIC1a. Further studies are needed to better understand the roles of ASIC1a and \nASIC2 at the retinal synapse. However, the retina may be an excellent location for \nstudying synaptic ASICs because of large size of retinal synapses and the proton \nrelease recorded there (6–8). \n4.7 Model of ASIC1a Function at the Synapse \nThe available data support a model of ASIC1a at the synapse (Figs. 1 and 6). In the \npost-synaptic membrane, ASICs seem well positioned to respond to protons released \nfrom presynaptic neurotransmitter (NT)-containing vesicles and also from other \nsources. In this model, various extracellular modulators and intracellular ASIC-\ninteracting proteins might influence the response, which would be expected to \ndepolarize the membrane potential and raise intracellular Ca2+ concentration, perhaps \ninfluencing other receptors and signaling proteins. An important prediction from this \nmodel is that ASIC currents will be activated during neurotransmission. However, \nthus far, studies in brain slices (65) and cultured neurons (77) have not detected \nJ.A. Wemmie et al."}

There are many possible explanations for these negative results, but they hint \nthat the story could be more complex. Perhaps the appropriate experimental \nconditions have not been identified. Interestingly however, a recent study discovered \nspontaneous ASIC activation in HEK293 cells (87). Presumably, protons released by \nvesicles evoked the ASIC current, because blocking vesicle acidification with \nbafilomycin prevented the spontaneous currents. This finding represents a potentially \nimportant step in identifying how endogenous ASICs may be activated. \n4.8 ASIC1a Affects Synaptic Spine Density \nRegardless of how ASIC1a acts at the synapse, evidence for some potentially \nimportant consequences has been obtained. For example, it was recently found that \nknocking down ASIC1a expression with RNAi in hippocampal slice neurons \nreduced the number of dendritic spines (71). An ASIC1a dominant-negative \nconstruct had a similar effect. In contrast, overexpressing ASIC1a in CA1 neurons \nhad the opposite effect and increased the number of dendritic spines. Possibly, the \nability of ASIC1a to affect spine number is related to its effects on synaptic [Ca2+] \n(57, 67, 71, 84) and LTP (65), although the precise mechanisms have not yet been \nestablished. Nevertheless, these observations suggest ASICs may influence spine \nremodeling in disease. Unlike the effects of acutely changing ASIC1a expression, \ndisrupting ASIC1a throughout development in the knockout mice did not change \nspine number, suggesting developmental mechanisms might compensate for some \neffects of ASIC1a disruption (71). Together, these functional effects on synaptic \nphysiology suggest that genetically or pharmacologically altering ASIC1a might \nhave important physiological and behavioral consequences. \n5 ASIC1a Regulates Behavior and May Contribute  \nto Neurological disease \n5.1 Disrupting ASIC1a Impaired Cerebellum-Dependent Learning \nThe location of ASIC1a in mouse brain provided important clues about the potential \ncontribution of the channel to behavior. By immunohistochemistry and protein \nblotting, it was found that ASIC1a protein was enriched in gray matter and in brain \nregions with high synaptic density (65, 66, 88). One region where ASIC1a was \nabundant was the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex (Fig. 8a) (65, 66). In \naddition, Purkinje cells which populate this layer of the cerebellum have large acid-\nevoked currents (75). Consistent with a role in cerebellum-dependent learning, the \nloss of ASIC1a significantly impaired classical delay eyeblink conditioning (Fig. 8b) \n(65). Mice normally learn that a tone predicts a periorbital shock and acquire the \nability to defensively blink before the shock occurs (i.e. a conditioned response). \nAfter 10 days of training, wild-type mice produced conditioned responses in more \nthan 80% of trials, whereas the ASIC1a-null mice produced a conditioned response \nin only 40% of trials. Disrupting ASIC1a did not alter shock sensitivity (65), hearing \n(88), or the blink reflex (65), suggesting a learning-related deficit. Although the"}
{"text": "===== Page 14 =====\n674 \n \nmechanism has not been determined, the loss of ASIC1a may have impaired \nplasticity in the cerebellar cortex. \n \n \nFig. 8  Localization of ASIC1a in brain structures underlying Pavlovian conditioning. (a) \nImmunofluorescent labeling of ASIC1a protein in ASIC1a+/+ relative to ASIC1a–/– mice \nrevealed abundant ASIC1a expression in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex \n(arrowheads). (b) Consistent with a role in cerebellum-dependent learning, loss of ASIC1a \nsignificantly impaired delay eyeblink conditioning. When the tone and shock were not paired \n(control), neither group developed conditioned responses. (c) In the forebrain, ASIC1a \nimmunolabeling was particularly abundant in the basolateral amygdala of wild-type mice \n(arrowheads). (d) Suggesting a role in amygdala-dependent learning, ASIC1a–/– disruption \nseverely impaired single-shock context fear conditioning. Twenty-four hours after receiving a \nsingle 0.5 mA footshock, wild-type mice froze when returned to the training chamber. In \ncontrast, ASIC1a-null mice froze very little. Mice not receiving a footshock during training \n(control) froze little or none during testing. Panels (a), (b), and (c) reproduced with permission \nfrom (65, 66, 88). \n5.2 ASIC1a Contributes to Pavlovian Fear Conditioning \nOutside of the cerebellum, ASIC1a is particularly abundant in structures that \nunderlie fear behaviors including the amygdala complex, bed nucleus of the stria \nterminalis, lateral hypothalamus, habenula, cingulate cortex, and periacqueductal \ngray (56, 59, 66, 77, 88, 89). In the amygdala, multiple nuclei express ASIC1a \nincluding the lateral, central, and medial nuclei, although ASIC1a immuno-labeling \nwas especially pronounced in the basolateral amygdala (88, 89). \nJ.A. Wemmie et al. \n."}
{"text": "===== Page 15 =====\nAcid-Sensing Ion Channels (ASICs) and pH in Synapse Physiology\n675\n \n \n \n \nThe distribution of ASIC1a in fear circuit structures and the effects of ASIC1a on \nsynaptic function, led to the question of whether ASIC1a influences Pavlovian fear \nconditioning. Wild-type and ASIC1a-null mice were tested in their ability to learn \nthe association between a fear-producing footshock and either the environmental \ncontext or an audible tone (66). Disrupting ASIC1a significantly impaired both \ncontext fear conditioning (Fig. 8d) and tone conditioning (66). Conversely, \noverexpressing ASIC1a in the mouse brain increased fear conditioning (76). The \neffects were not due to sensory dysfunction because both hearing (88) and footshock \nsensitivity (66) were unaffected by ASIC1a gene disruption. \n5.3 Interrupting ASIC1a Reduces Unconditioned Fear \nEffects of ASIC1a on unconditioned fear responses have also been tested (67). The \nloss of ASIC1a reduced unconditioned fear in the open field test, during acoustic \nstartle, and in response to predator odor. Curiously, the loss of ASIC1a did not \nreduce undonditioned fear in the elevated plus maze, suggesting that this fear \nbehavior is not ASIC1a-dependent (65). The effects of ASIC1a disruption on \nunconditioned fear are probably not due to developmental abnormalities, because \nacutely inhibiting ASIC1a in the brain post-developmentally with PcTx1 venom \nreduced TMT-evoked fear in wild-type mice, but not in ASIC1a-null mice (67).  \n \nThe observation that ASIC1a contributes to fear learning, suggests that ASIC1a \ncontributes to plasticity in the fear circuit. In addition, the finding that ASIC1a \naffects unconditioned fear suggests that ASIC1a can regulate fear circuit activity \nindependent of long-lasting plasticity. These effects of ASIC1a resemble those of \nAMPA and NMDA receptors, the inhibition of which reduces both fear learning and \nthe expression of learned fear. However, further studies are needed to better \nundestand how ASIC1a affects neurotransmission in the amygdala and elsewhere in \nthe fear circuit. Nevertheless, the ability of ASIC1a inhibition to reduce multiple fear \nbehaviors, raises the possibility that ASIC1a antagonists could reduce anxiety in \nhumans and might benefit other psychiatric diseases. Anti-anxiety medications with \nnovel mechanisms of action could offer advantages over current medications, which \ncan cause a number of unwanted side effects. \n5.4 Ischemic Stroke \nCentral acidosis exacerbates neurodegenerative diseases including ischemic stroke. \nBecause Ca2+ overload causes toxicity in the ischemic brain, and because ASIC1a \nactivation raises intracellular Ca2+, it was hypothesized that ASIC1a activation might \nincrease ischemic cell death. Enhancement of ASIC1a function by activation of \nNMDA receptors (84), lack of oxygen or glucose (67), or accumulation of lactate or \narachidonic acid (75) might further exacerbate ASIC1a-mediated neurotoxicity. A \npossible role for ASIC1a in ischemic toxicity was initially supported by experiments \nin cells heterologously expressing ASIC1a and in cultured hippocampal neurons \n(57). Neurons lacking ASIC1a and cells treated with amiloride or PcTx1 resisted \nacidosis-induced injury (57, 67). Moreover, PcTx1 diminished the effects of NMDA-\ninduced cell death (67). Establishing a strong case for a role in ischemic disease,"}
{"text": "===== Page 16 =====\n676 \n \ndisrupting ASIC1a in mice reduced infarct volume by 60% following experimental \nstroke due to middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion (67). Interestingly, pH remains \nlow for hours after a stroke, thus opening a window of therapeutic opportunity. Even \nadministering PcTx1 five hours after MCA occlusion reduced infarct volume by \n>50% (90). These encouraging results endorse ASIC1a inhibitors as a potential new \ntreatment for stroke. \n5.5 Central Pain Regulation \nIn peripheral neurons, ASICs contribute to acid-evoked nociception (reviewed in \n(62)). Recently, ASICs in the central nervous system (CNS) were also implicated in \npain control (91). Inhibiting ASIC1a in the CNS by injecting PcTx1 or ASIC1a anti-\nsense RNA into the cerebrospinal fluid reduced inflammatory and neuropathic pain. \nThe analgesic effects were linked to elevated met-enkephalin levels. The possible \nrelationship between ASIC1a function at the synapse and met-enkephalin expression \nis not yet clear, although it is interesting to speculate that blocking ASIC1a could \nattenuate previously observed anti-opiod effects of FMRFamide related peptides \n(92). Thexse observations suggest a promising opportunity for targeting ASICs in \npain control. \n6 Concluding Remarks \nThe identification of ASIC1a as synaptic proton receptors and an increasing \nappreciation of pH dynamics in the CNS suggest new possibilities for proton \nmediated cellular signaling. Although much remains to be learned about the ASICs, \nthe available data indicate an intriguing role in synapse function. Perhaps like a \nneurotransmitter, protons cross the synapse to activate or modulate ASICs and other \nproteins. In addition, at the cell surface and at synapses, ASICs may be readily \naccessible to pharmacological modification, suggesting fertile ground for novel drug \ndiscovery. Studies in mice point to possible therapeutic benefits of ASIC1a \nantagonists in psychiatric disease, neurodegeneration, and pain. \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank Theresa Mayhew and Ashley Small for assistance preparing the \nmanuscript, and Kelsey Coulter for help preparing the figures.

{"text": "===== Page 22 =====\n \n \n1 Introduction \nLong before the discovery of green fluorescent protein (GFP), Ramon y Cajal recog-\nnized glia’s intimate association with synapses in the brain. Though their function \nwas at that time a mystery, he predicted that glia must be doing more than simply \nfilling the spaces between neurons. Not surprisingly, Cajal was correct. Although \nincapable of firing action potentials, glia are highly excitable cells, communicating \nwith neurons and other glia primarily through chemical signals. While it is well \nestablished that glia have many important support functions in the nervous system, \nemerging evidence reveals a far more dynamic role for glial cells at the synapse.  \n \nWe now appreciate that glia express many of the same voltage-gated ion channels \nand neurotransmitter receptors that neurons do and are thus well equipped to receive \nand transmit neuroactive signals. Through these mechanisms, glia can signal to pre \nand postsynaptic neurons and affect synaptic excitability and plasticity. Glia also \nactively communicate with one another in the form of calcium waves. The realiza-\ntion that dynamic bi-directional signaling between neurons and glia modulates syn-\naptic transmission has led to re-definition of the synapse. The “tripartite synapse” is \na term that was recently coined to incorporate glia as the third participant at the syn-\napse, actively communicating with both the pre- and the post-synaptic neuron (2) \n(Fig. 1c).  \n \nGlia also play an important role in the development and maintenance of synapses. \nTheir appearance at synapses in the postnatal brain and developing neuromuscular \njunction coincides with periods of developmental plasticity. A growing body of \nresearch indicates a pivotal role for glial-derived signals in the formation of struc-\ntural and functional synapses.

{"text": "===== Page 3 =====\nGlia as Active Participants in the Development and Function of Synapses\n685\n \n \n \n2 Types of Glial Cells Associated with Synapses \nIn the human brain, glial cells outnumber neurons by a factor of ten, and numerous \nglial subtypes are easily identified based on their unique morphological, physiologi-\ncal, and biochemical features. Major types of glia in the nervous system include: \nmyelinating glia (oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells), astrocytes, and microglia. In \nthe CNS, glia that communicate with synapses include astrocytes, oligodendrocyte \nprogenitor cells and possibly microglia. In the PNS, perisynaptic Schwann cells \n(PSCs) ensheath synapses at the neuromuscular junction. \n \nClassical neurohistologists divided astrocytes into two main classes, which are \ndistinguished by morphology and location, and perhaps function as well. Protoplas-\nmic astrocytes are found in grey matter and their processes are closely associated \nwith synapses as well as blood vessels. Fibrillary (or fibrous) astrocytes in white \nmatter contact nodes of Ranvier. In addition, there are specialized astrocytes includ-\ning Müller glia in the retina and Bergmann glia in the cerebellum. \n \n Although most roles of protoplasmic astrocytes remain a great mystery, there is \nlittle doubt that they buffer ions and neurotransmitters in the extracellular space. \nAstrocytic processes intimately contact and ensheath pre- and postsynaptic terminals \n(115). Until recently, our understanding of astrocyte morphology was based on clas-\nsical immunostaining for a widely used astrocytic marker GFAP, (glial fibrillary \nacidic protein), which grossly underestimates the complexity of astrocytes and their \ninteractions with neurons and other cells (Fig. 1b). Recent in vivo imaging and three \ndimensional reconstructions of dye filled astrocytes revealed that adjacent astrocytes \nextend thousands of dense spongiform processes and are organized into large, non-\noverlapping anatomical domains. In fact, it has been estimated that a single astrocyte \ncan associate with an average of four neurons (40), and contact over 100,000 syn-\napses (14) (Fig. 1). Astrocytes express receptors for most neurotransmitters, and can \nrelease a variety of neuroactive, synaptogenic and trophic factors. Together these \nfindings place astrocytes in an important position to actively exchange signals with \nneurons and other glial cells to coordinate synaptic networks. \n \nRecent research has revealed a surprising new role for oligodendrocyte precursor \ncells (OPCs) at the synapse. These cells represent a third class of glia in the adult \nCNS and have morphological and physiological features distinct from oligodendro-\ncytes and astrocytes (19, 49). These small, stellate shaped glial cells express the \nchondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, NG2. Based on their anatomical and physiological \nproperties, it is likely that many of the cells originally classified as “complex cells” \nor “immature astrocytes” are actually NG2+ OPCs (NG2 cells). While the function \nof this new class of glial cells is still unknown, recent electrophysiological and ana-\ntomical studies revealed that NG2 cells express an array of voltage gated channels, \nas well as receptors for neurotransmitters. However unlike ensheathing perisynaptic \nglia, which respond to “spillover” of chemical transmitters from presynaptic termi-\nnals, NG2 cells receive direct synaptic inputs from neurons (81). These findings \nchallenge current dogma that functional synapses are a unique feature of neurons. \n \nMicroglia comprise about 10% of CNS glia, and exist in multiple morphological \nstates in the healthy and damaged brain. Like other glial cell types, much of their \nfunction remains mysterious. They act as internal “sensors” of the extracellular"}

Recent in vivo time-\nlapse imaging has revealed dynamic interactions between microglia and neurons in \nthe brain following lesion or injury (23, 73). Much like immune cells, microglia can \nelicit inflammatory responses and phagocytose cellular debris in response to injury, \nbut new research indicates that microglia may also play a role in synapse develop-\nment in the healthy brain. \n3 Role of Glia in Synapse Formation and Development \nThe traditional assumption that the ability of neurons to form synapses is intrinsic led \nearly studies on synaptic development to focus on neuronal signals and surface \nmolecules. However, in the last decade, mounting evidence from a variety of studies \nhas demonstrated a role for glia in the formation of both the central and peripheral \nnervous system synapses. In this section we will discuss these studies and their influ-\nence on our current perception of glia as an active partner in the development of the \nnervous system. \n3.1 Role of Astrocytes in Synapse Formation in the Central Nervous \nSystem \nAstrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the brain. Through their intricate proc-\nesses, astrocytes ensheath synapses and are known to listen and respond to synaptic \nsignals. Do they also play a role in the establishment of the synaptic contacts in the \ndeveloping brain? Interestingly, there is a strong correlation between the timing of \nthe birth and maturation of astrocytes and the formation of synapses in the CNS. For \nexample, in the visual system, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) reach their thalamic \ntargets in the superior colliculus beginning around embryonic day 16 and most RGC \naxons innervate the colliculus by the day of birth, postnatal day 0 (54). Despite the \narrival of axons in their target area, there is a one week delay before the majority of \nsynapses are formed in the superior colliculus. Coincident with this delay, the birth \nand proliferation of astrocytes in the superior colliculus also occurs during the first \npostnatal week. This spatiotemporal correlation between synaptogenesis and astro-\ncyte development strongly suggests that signals from astrocytes might regulate the \ninitiation of synapse formation (114). The presence of this additional regulatory step \nin the timing of synaptogenesis might be necessary to ensure that all axons reach \ntheir targets before the competition for synaptic territory begins.  \n \nDo astrocytes regulate the formation of synapses? Evidence supporting the hy-\npothesis that astrocytes secrete extracellular signals that induce synapse formation \nhas emerged from in vi tr o studies with purified RGCs. RGCs can be purified from \n \nIn the peripheral nervous system (PNS), perisynaptic Schwann cells are special-\nized non-myelinating Schwann cells that ensheath the synaptic junction between \nmotor neuron and muscle fibers PSCs are important for the formation, function and \nmaintenance of neuromuscular junctions and play a pivotal role in synaptic repair \nafter injury."}

Under these conditions, \nRGCs have equally high rates of survival and neurite outgrowth, regardless of \nwhether or not they are cultured in the presence of astrocytes (62). Using these cells \nPfrieger and Barres found that RGCs cultured in the absence of astrocytes exhibited \nvery little spontaneous synaptic activity when excitatory postsynaptic currents were \nmeasured by patch-clamp. In contrast, the RGCs exhibited high levels of synaptic \nactivity when they were cultured in the presence of a feeding layer of astrocytes or \nastrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) (86) (Fig. 2). They have concluded that the \n \n \n \nFig. 2. Astrocytes promote synapse formation via the release of secreted factors. \n(a) RGCs require astrocyte-secreted factors to form synapses. Immunostaining of RGCs for \ncolocalization of presynaptic Synaptotagmin (red) and postsynaptic PSD-95 (green) shows \nfew co-localized synaptic puncta in the absence of astrocytes indicating that RGCs alone did \nnot form many synapses. Many synapses (colocalized puncta) were present in RGCs cultured \nwith a feeding layer of astrocytes or with purified TSP. (b) Astrocytes induce synapse forma-\ntion in two steps. First TSP and/or other synaptogenic factors induce formation of structural \nsynapses that have pre and post synaptic specializations and presynaptically active but post-\nsynaptically silent as no significant action potentials can be recorded. A second factor(s) acti-\nvates these postsynaptically silent synapses by facilitating insertion of AMPARs to the postsy-\nnaptic site."}
{"text": "===== Page 6 =====\n688 \nC. Eroglu et al. \n \nThe TSP-induced synapses are ultrastructurally normal with pre- and postsynap-\ntic specializations similar to those in RGC cultures grown with an astrocyte feeding \nlayer. TSP treatment did not affect the total levels of synaptic proteins but instead \ninduced synapse formation by promoting the localization of synaptic proteins to \nsynapses and the alignment of pre and postsynaptic sites (20). Interestingly, while \nthe TSP-induced synapses are structurally normal and presynaptically active, they \nare postsynaptically silent, due to the lack of surface AMPA receptors at postsynap-\ntic sites (20). In contrast, astrocyte feeding layers and ACM can each induce both \npre- and postsynaptic activity (Fig. 2). These data suggest that the regulation of syn-\naptogenesis by astrocytes occurs in at least two steps (112). Astrocytes provide TSPs \n \n \n \n \n \nability of astrocytes to enhance synaptic activity depends on astrocyte-secreted pro-\nteins. This activity was mimicked by Schwann cells, and oligodendrocytes, but not \nby fibroblasts or microglia (86, 112). Similar to RGCs, purified spinal motor neurons \nexhibited little synaptic activity unless astrocytes or Schwann cells were present \n(113). Taken together, these findings reveal that astrocytes and other perisynaptic \nglia, such as Schwann cells, release soluble signals that profoundly enhance synaptic \nactivity by nearly 100-fold. \n \nTo determine whether this increase in synaptic activity could be attributed to an \nincrease in either synapse number or synaptic efficacy, Ullian and colleagues exam-\nined the effects of astrocytes on the number of synapses that formed between RGCs \nin vitro. They found that astrocytes induce a 7-fold increase in synapse number be-\ntween RGCs, as measured by immunostaining with pre- and postsynaptic markers, as \nwell as by electron microscopy (114). These synapses were ultrastructurally normal \nand they were both pre- and postsynaptically functional. Patch-clamp recordings \nfrom neurons that have been grown at clonal density and allowed to synapse upon \nthemselves (a.k.a. autaptic neurons), showed a close correlation between the number \nof synapses observed by immunostaining and the number of synapses estimated by \nmeasuring the quantal content of the evoked response. Taken together, these findings \nshow that astrocytes profoundly increase the number of synapses that form between \nCNS neurons in vitro. This was the first evidence that the number of synapses a \nneuron can form is not solely determined by the intrinsic properties of that neuron \nbut instead can be powerfully controlled by extracellular signals. The 7-fold increase \nin synapse number, however, is not as large as the nearly 100-fold increase in synap-\ntic activity induced by astrocytes suggesting that astrocytes can also enhance synap-\ntic function. \n \nWhat are the astrocyte-secreted factors that induce synapse formation? Interest-\ningly, Christopherson and colleagues identified Thrombospondins (TSP) as the sig-\nnals coming from astrocytes that can induce an increase in synapse number (20). \nThey showed that purified TSP1 can increase synapse number in RGC cultures to a \nsimilar degree to ACM (Fig. 2). TSPs are a family of very large (450kDa) oligomeric \nextracellular matrix proteins and they are normally expressed in brain by glia and are \npresent in ACM. TSP2, a closely related TSP family member, was also found to \ninduce synapse formation at levels similar to TSP1, and was the major TSP type in \nthe ACM. Immunodepletion of TSPs from ACM decreased its synaptogenic effect \ndown to control levels showing that TSPs are the key synaptogenic component of \nACM (20)."}

Astrocytes also secrete a second \nsignal that converts these silent synapses into functional units (Fig. 2B, right panel). \nThis silent to active synapse conversion through the activation of AMPA receptor-\nmediated responses resembles the AMPA receptor-dependent enhancement of synap-\ntic strength observed following the induction of long-term potentiation (32) suggest-\ning that astrocytes also secrete signals that play important roles in synaptic plasticity.  \n \nHow do TSPs promote synapse formation? Most likely TSPs provide a permis-\nsive signal for synapse formation within the developing brain. However, if TSPs are \npermissive and are required for synapse maintenance, they should also be present in \nthe adult CNS where synapses are stably maintained. Infact there are five TSP iso-\nforms in mammals and recent developmental gene expression analysis of astrocytes \nin rodent brain revealed an interesting spatial and temporal expression pattern for \nTSPs (25). All TSP isoforms except TSP5 are expressed by astrocytes. In agreement \nwith previous observations, TSP1 and 2 are expressed by young astrocytes in devel-\noping brain during the first two postnatal weeks, when the bulk of synaptogenesis \ntakes place. As the animal matures their expression goes down. In contrast, TSP4 \nexpression is only detected in mature astrocytes (after postnatal day 17). These re-\nsults suggest that TSP4 is the adult form of TSP in the CNS and might play a role in \nsynaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the adult brain.  \n \nRecent data indicate that all TSP isoforms are synaptogenic, but that they differ \nin their effects on neurite outgrowth. TSP1 promotes RGC neurite extension, while \nTSP4 inhibits outgrowth and branching in vitro (25). This differential effect on neu-\nrite outgrowth might explain the reason for this developmental isoform switch. Early \nin development neurons are required to both extend their neurites and form new \nsynapses. Correspondingly TSP1 and TSP2, which promote both of these processes, \nare expressed. As the animal matures, the major neural circuits are established and \nthe formation of new synapses does not require extensive outgrowth; thus synapse \nformation and maintenance function is taken over by TSP4 in the adult brain. Sur-\nprising recent work comparing gene expression patterns in brains of humans and \nother nonhuman primates reveals that in humans TSP4 and TSP2 expression levels \nare dramatically increased (15). Does this mean that humans, because of TSPs, have \na greater capacity to form synapses, and that this capability underlies our increased \nbrain function?  \n \nIs TSP the only synaptogenic signal secreted by astrocytes or just the tip of the \niceberg? Further study of astrocyte-secreted proteins and their role in synapse  \n \nDo TSPs promote synapse formation in vivo? Interestingly, TSP1 and TSP2 are \nexpressed in the brain during the early postnatal stages when the majority of syn-\napses are forming, and both proteins are significantly down-regulated in the adult \nwhen rate of synaptogenesis is significantly reduced (20). In agreement with the in \nvitro data, TSP1/TSP2 double mutant mice exhibited a 25–30% reduction in the \nnumber of synapses formed during first and third postnatal weeks (20). In conclu-\nsion, TSPs are the key synaptogenic signal in ACM, TSP1 and TSP2 expression \ncoincides with synaptogenesis in vivo, and loss of TSP1/2 function significantly \ndecreases synapse formation."}
{"text": "===== Page 8 =====\n690 \nC. Eroglu et al. \n \nformation is necessary to answer this question. Astrocytes might secrete other signals \nthat are capable of inducing formation of structural synapses similar to TSPs or they \nmay also secrete signals that inhibit synapse formation. Secretion of both positive \nand negative regulators of synapse formation would give astrocytes the ability to \nregulate the timing and location of synapse formation with greater precision. Addi-\ntionally, while identification of TSP significantly improved our understanding of the \nrole of astrocytes in synapse formation, discovery and characterization of the neu-\nronal TSP receptor will help clarify the cellular mechanism by which TSP estab-\nlishes synaptic contact and might help us to better understand molecular basis of \nsynapse formation in the CNS.  \n \nIn addition to astrocyte-secreted proteins, Mauch et al. identified cholesterol in \nApolipoprotein E (ApoE) particles coming from astrocytes as a potential signal that \ninduces the formation of functional synapses between RGCs in culture (58). They \nobserved that cholesterol enhances synaptic activity by increasing the quantal con-\ntent of evoked responses in autoptic RGCs. This increase can be explained by an \nincrease in the number of release sites (36). In addition, cholesterol is a limiting \nfactor in synaptic vesicle formation and is required for vesicle turn-over events due \nto its regulation of vesicle curvature (109). Cholesterol is also necessary for lipid raft \nformation, and its membrane concentration can be critical for correct function of \nsignaling processes as well as the activity of postsynaptic glutamate receptors that \nregulate synaptic function (43). One caveat is that most of these experiments were \nperformed on autaptic neurons cultured at clonal density and thus these neurons were \npossibly in highly cholesterol-starved condition. Thus, future studies are necessary to \ndetermine the importance of astrocyte-derived cholesterol for synaptogenesis in vivo. \nInterestingly, in higher density cultures, cholesterol enhanced presynaptic function \nwhile it had no effect on postsynaptic function, and its effects in increasing synapse \nnumber were negligible (20). \n \nAstrocytes also regulate the formation of inhibitory synapses between hippocam-\npal neurons in vitro (24). When hippocampal neurons were either co-cultured with \nastrocytes or treated with astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM), Elmariah et al. \nobserved a significant increase in the number of inhibitory pre- and postsynaptic \nterminals, as well as an increase in the frequency of miniature IPSCs . They further \nexplored whether the neurotrophin, Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and \nits receptor Tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB), which are potent modulators of in-\nhibitory synaptic structure and function, mediate the effects of astrocytes on inhibi-\ntory synapses. Astrocytes deficient in either BDNF or TrkB maintained the ability to \nincrease the number of inhibitory pre- and postsynaptic specializations in wild type \nneurons. However when neurons from these knockout mice were treated with wild \ntype ACM, no increase was observed in the number of postsynaptic GABA (A) \nreceptor clusters even though the increase in the number of inhibitory presynaptic \nterminals persisted. These results suggest that astrocytes may modulate inhibitory \npostsynaptic development by stimulating Trk signaling between neurons, but that the \nneurons themselves are the source of TrkB ligand BDNF. It is noteworthy that astro-\ncytes modulate inhibitory synapse formation via distinct pre- and postsynaptic \nmechanisms, quite similar to the two step model of astrocytes regulation of excita-\ntory synaptogenesis."}

Two consequent studies by Song et al. on neuronal stem \ncells elegantly show that astrocytes indeed play an active role in synaptogenesis in \nadult brain. Stem cells from the adult hippocampus require a signal to differentiate \ninto neurons. One source of this signal is hippocampal astrocytes (102). Once the \nstem cells have differentiated into their appropriate neuronal cell types, however, the \nneurons need an additional signal from astrocytes in order to integrate into synaptic \ncircuits (102, 103). The second astrocyte signal appears to be necessary to promote \nan increase in synapse number in fully differentiated neurons. This work suggests \nthat astrocytes continue to play a role in synaptogenesis in the adult brain and are \ninvolved in integration of newly born neurons into already existing circuits in the \nhippocampus. Whether TSPs or other known astrocyte derived signals are involved \nin this process remains to be discovered. \n \nBesides astrocyte-secreted factors that induce synapse formation, astrocytes \nmight also regulate synapse formation through contact mediated mechanisms. A \nstudy by Hama et al. provided evidence that astrocytes affect neuronal synaptogene-\nsis by the process of adhesion (41). They showed that local contact with astrocytes \nvia integrin receptors activates protein kinase C (PKC) in individual dissociated \nneurons. They observed that PKC activation, while initially focal, eventually spread \nthroughout the entire neuron and facilitated excitatory synaptogenesis. Thus, they \nconclude that propagation of PKC signaling represents an underlying mechanism for \nglobal neuronal maturation following local astrocyte adhesion (41). One interesting \ndifference between this clonal density hippocampal neuron culture system and RGCs \nis that treatment with ACM alone is able to induce RGC synapse formation, while \nhippocampal neurons require astrocytic contact. One possible reason for this discrep-\nancy could be the age difference between the hippocampal neurons (isolated from \nembryonic day 17 brains) and RGCs (isolated from postnatal day 5 retinas). There \nmight be an age dependent switch in neurons in which their ability to respond to \nsoluble synaptogenic signals from astrocytes is induced by another environmental \ncue, such as contact with astrocytes themselves. Indeed, Ullian et al., found that \nastrocyte contact induced embryonic (E17) RGCs to become receptive to synapto-\ngenic signals secreted from astrocytes (E. Ullian and B. Barres, in preparation). \n3.2 Role of Perisynaptic Schwann Cells in Synapse Formation in the PNS \nParallel to astrocytes’ role in CNS synapse formation, Schwann cells (SCs), the \nperisynaptic glia at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), also actively participate in \nPNS synaptogenesis and synaptic function.  \n \nThe classical doctrine of NMJ formation states that motor neuron derived factors \nsuch as Agrin induce the clustering of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) \n(60). Is there also a SC component to NMJ formation? Indeed early studies on the \nformation of NMJ pointed to the presence of a factor that was able to induce upregu-\nlation of postsynaptic AChR subunits. This factor was then cloned and identified as \nNeuregulin, also known as AChR inducing activity (ARIA). Interestingly, \nNeuregulins are growth/differentiation factors essential for SC lineage differentiation \nand survival. In addition to their effects on SCs, Neuregulins have been associated"}
{"text": "===== Page 10 =====\n692 \nC. Eroglu et al. \n \nwith NMJ formation. A decade ago Trachtenberg and Thompson (111) found that the \naddition of the Neuregulin to developing NMJs resulted in SC process extension and \nmigration away from the synapse. Coinciding with SC migration, the nerve terminals \nretracted from the synapse and regrew along with the SCs away from postsynaptic \nsites. The motor neuron (MN) axons were unable to make synapses onto muscle until \nthe Neuregulin was removed. They suggested that SCs directly instruct the synaptic \nremodeling that occurs in vivo and they concluded that SCs play an important role in \nthe formation of the NMJ synapse. However, it is been hard to pinpoint the cellular \norigin of Neuregulin function as both SCs and MNs express the receptors for \nNeuregulin. It was suggested that either Neuregulin independently induces both the \nSCs and MN axons to leave the synapse and reenter a plastic growth state, or \nNeuregulin affects only SCs by inducing them to become synaptogenic. \n \nRecently Cao and Ko characterized SC-CM’s effect on synaptic function (16). \nThey found that SC-CM increased the frequency of spontaneous synaptic currents \n \nIf SCs regulate synaptogenesis at the NMJ then lack of SCs should affect NMJ \nformation and function. A conditional knockdown of Neuregulin1 in motor and sen-\nsory neurons led to the total loss of Schwann cells in the peripheral nerves. However \nthere were no significant changes in the AChR gene expression (120). On the other \nhand mice deficient in ErbB2, a Neuregulin receptor, also failed to develop the \nSchwann cell lineage, a defect that was accompanied by impaired development of \nthe junctional folds of NMJ synapses (52). Similarly, an elegant study by Reddy and \ncolleagues showed that when perisynaptic Schwann cells were ablated by comple-\nment lysis in live frog muscles, formation of synapses was dramatically reduced and \nexisting synapses underwent retraction (90).  \n \nSCs strongly induce the formation of functional synapses between spinal MNs \n(113) or between Xenopus MNs and muscle cells in culture (82). SC-conditioned \nmedium (SC-CM) mimics these effects, indicating the presence of soluble SC-\nsecreted factors that promote synapse formation in PNS. How do SCs increase syn-\napse number in MN-muscle co-cultures? Peng and colleagues proposed that SCs \npromote synaptogenesis by instructing neurons to synthesize a factor necessary for \nNMJ formation and showed that SC-CM induced an increase in Agrin expression by \ncultured MNs. This way SCs may mediate a switch in MNs from a growth state to a \nsynaptogenic state (82). This is quite reminiscent of the permissive role of TSPs in \nthe CNS. It is possible to postulate that glia act as switches both in PNS and CNS, \nconverting axons from growth state to synaptogenic state. Feng and Ko identified \ntransforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) as a component of SC-CM that is able to \ninduce formation of synapses in Xenopus nerve-muscle cultures (26). They showed \nthat TGF-β1 protein was present in SC-CM and that treatment of nerve-muscle cul-\ntures with purified TGF-β1, in the presence of trophic stimulation, induced neuronal \nAgrin expression and synaptogenesis along nerve-muscle contacts. Immunodepletion \nof TGF-β1 with a specific antibody abolished the synaptogenic effect of SC-CM. \nLatency-associated protein (LAP), which binds to TGF-β1 and prevents it from bind-\ning to TGF-β1 receptors, also blocked the effect of SC-CM (26). Taken together, \nthese results indicate that TGF-β1 in SC-CM may be the glial signal that instructs \nneurons to switch from a “growth state” to a “synaptogenic state”."}

This was a presynaptic effect inde-\npendent of neuronal excitability and required the influx of Ca2+, most likely through \nL and N-type voltage gated calcium channels potentiating spontaneous transmitter \nrelease. In contrast, SC-CM suppressed the evoked transmitter release. The molecu-\nlar weight of functional factor(s) in SC-CM was within 500 and 5000 Da range and \nthe SC-CM effect was not attributable to currently known factors that modulate \nsynaptic efficacy, such as neurotrophins, glutamate, or ATP (16). These results sug-\ngest that SCs release small molecules that enhance spontaneous synaptic activity \nacutely and potently at developing neuromuscular synapses; however it is not yet \nclear whether this small factor also contributes to the increase in synapse number \nobserved by Ullian et al. and Peng et al. Taken together, these studies show that SCs, \nlike astrocytes, secrete synapse-promoting factors that can increase the number of \nMN synapses in vitro and profoundly affect NMJ formation and function.\n \n3.3 Role of Glia in Synapse Elimination and Refinement of Neural \nCircuits \nDuring development, the formation of mature neural circuits requires the selective \nelimination or pruning of inappropriate synaptic connections. The specific molecular \nmechanisms that drive synapse elimination remain a mystery but it is has been hy-\npothesized that synapses are removed by either the retraction of presynaptic axons or \nthe degeneration of axons and their subsequent phagocytosis by glial cells. Recent \nevidence suggests that glia may not only be engulfing axonal debris, but may also be \nactively involved in the process of developmental pruning.  \n \nIn the Drosophila nervous system, larval mushroom body (MB) γ neurons ini-\ntially extend axon branches into the dorsal and medial MB axon lobes that later un-\ndergo fragmentation and pruning. Awasaki and colleagues recently used a combina-\ntion of high resolution imaging and molecular approaches to label MB axons to show \nthat glial cells are recruited to MB axon lobes before axonal fragmentation and that \nthey engulf MB axonal varicosities prior to their degeneration. Importantly, glial \ninvasion and axon pruning was significantly impaired when the ability of glia to \nphagocytose was perturbed by inhibitors of glial endocytosis (5). In addition, Watts \net al. showed that MB γ neuron terminals were incorporated within the lysosomal \ncompartments of neighboring glial cells, further suggesting a role for phagocytosis in \naxon pruning (119). It was later shown that glial cells recognize and engulf degener-\nating MB axons through the function of Draper, the glial engulfment receptor (6, 33). \nTogether these findings strongly suggest that glia actively contribute to developmen-\ntal pruning in Drosophila.  \n \nA similar process of axon removal by SCs, termed “axosome shedding”, occurs \nduring synapse elimination at the mammalian NMJ junction. Postsynaptic muscle \ncells are initially innervated by multiple motor axons, but by the second postnatal \nweek, a process of activity-dependent competition promotes the permanent elimina-\ntion of the majority of these immature inputs, allowing only one input to be main-\ntained and strengthened (95). As the losing axon withdraws, its distal ends form a \nretraction bulb (34, 92). Until recently, it was not known how these retraction bulbs \nformed or how retracted axons were eliminated. A combination of time-lapse"}
{"text": "===== Page 12 =====\n694 \nC. Eroglu et al. \n \n \nMoreover, a recent study has provided evidence that the classical complement \ncascade, part of the innate immune system, helps to mediate synapse elimination in \nthe developing CNS. In the developing mammalian visual system, astrocytes induce \nneuronal expression of C1q, the initiating protein of this cascade. C1q’s best known \nrole in the innate immune system is to opsonize or “tag” unwanted cells or debris for \nelimination. Recent work shows that C1q is expressed by postnatal retinal ganglion \nneurons in response to immature astrocytes and is then localized to synapses \nthroughout the postnatal brain and retina (105).  Mice deficient in complement pro-\ntein C1q or the downstream complement cascade protein C3 exhibit large sustained \ndefects in CNS synapse elimination, as shown by the failure of anatomical refine-\nment of retinogeniculate connections and the retention of excess retinal innervation \nby lateral geniculate neurons. Microglia, the resident phagocytes of the brain, ex-\npress receptors for C1q and C3, and have been shown to phagoctose synaptic termi-\nnals of motor neurons following injury, in a process known as synaptic stripping. \nTogether these findings add to the growing evidence that immune system molecules \nare crucial for patterning of neural circuits (11, 45), and support a model in which \nunwanted synapses are tagged by complement proteins for elimination by phagocytic \ncells.  As C1q levels become highly elevated in the adult brain in the setting of neu-\nrodegenerative disease, these findings also raise the interesting possibility that the \nclassical complement cascade mediates synapse loss in diseases such as Alzheimer’s \ndisease, ALS, and glaucoma. \n3.4 Role of Glia in Synaptic Maintenance and Structural Plasticity \n3.4.1 Glia in Synaptic Maintenance  \nGlia have traditionally been viewed as the support cells that provide trophic support \nto neurons and maintain the homeostatic environment necessary for proper synaptic \nfunction. Are glia also necessary for the maintenance of the synaptic adhesions? To \nfind out, Ullian and colleagues (114) examined whether the glial-induced synapses \nwould be maintained in culture if the glial cells were removed. First synapses were \nallowed to form by co-culturing purified RGCs with a feeder layer of astrocytes \ncultured on a removable insert. After 1 week, as expected many synapses had \nformed. They then removed the astrocyte insert and cultured RGCs alone for an \nadditional week. When they examined the synapses formed by these RGC neurons  \n \n \n \nimaging and serial electron microscopy (EM) demonstrated that as inappropriate \naxons disappeared, they shed small membrane bound particles termed “axosomes” \nthat contain intact synaptic vesicles and organelles. Importantly, axosomes were \nformed by the engulfment of the tips of retreating axons by neighboring SCs (10). It \nwas suggested that this phagocytic process is a novel means of transferring synaptic  \ninformation between the cytoplasmic compartments of neurons and glial cells. While \nit is not known what molecules drive this phagocytic process, this study raises the \nintriguing possibility that glia actively contribute to synapse elimination in  \nmammals."}
{"text": "===== Page 13 =====\nGlia as Active Participants in the Development and Function of Synapses\n695\n \nby immunostaining and patch clamp recording, they found that the majority of syn-\napses were lost when the astrocytes were removed (114). These findings provide \nevidence that astrocytes are required for synapse stability, ensuring synaptic mainte-\nnance. This also raises the possibility that astrocytes may increase synapse number \nby enhancing synapse stability. However, dissection of synapse maintenance from \nother possible mechanisms such as enhancement of the rate of formation of synapses \nby astrocytes is difficult. The relative contribution of astrocytes to synapse formation \nand stabilization need to be investigated further. \n \nAre perisynaptic Schwann cells also required for synaptic maintenance and func-\ntion? Reddy et al. showed that in addition to their role in the establishment of the \nNMJ, SCs play a very important role in the maintenance of synaptic adhesion and \nsynaptic function in mature NMJ (90). Using the frog NMJ as a model system, they \ninvestigated the effects of removing synaptic glia from a mature synaptic contact. \nPerisynaptic SCs in an intact adult frog were selectively labeled with a monoclonal \nantibody that specifically recognizes these cells. Once the antibody labeled cells \nwere exposed to complement and lysed via the complement cascade, the presynaptic \nMN terminals and the postsynaptic muscle cell were intact but “naked”, lacking their \nsynaptic partner the perisynaptic SC. Interestingly, one week post ablation the pre-\nsynaptic function at the naked synapses decreased by half and there was a ten-fold \nincrease in the retraction of presynaptic terminals from the muscle. Taken together \nthese studies suggest that SCs in PNS and astrocytes in CNS play important roles in \nstabilizing mature synaptic contacts. \nSo far we have reviewed the function of glia in the formation and maintenance of \nsynapses as well as the elimination of unwanted ones. Capability of astrocytes and \nSchwann cells to control the establishment and breakdown of synapses gives them \nthe ability to sculpt our nervous system, begging the question of whether glial signals \nalso regulate structural plasticity in the brain. \n \nDendritic spines are small protrusions visible on dendrites of neurons that serve \nas postsynaptic sites for excitatory inputs. They are highly dynamic structures and a \nlarge body of research has linked changes in spine number and morphology to \nchanges in neuronal activity and experience (53). During development spines are \nhighly dynamic whereas in the adult brain they become more stable; hence a correla-\ntion exists between age dependent spine dynamics and the plasticity of the brain. The \ndecrease in spine motility in adult could also be attributed to the close association of \nastrocytes with synapses. Astrocytes might provide both physical constraints that \ninhibit spine movement as well as molecular interactions that stabilize spines. Indeed \nan exciting study by Murai et al. showed that astrocytes help to control dendritic \nspine morphology in vivo through bi-directional Ephrin/EphA signaling (68). They \nobserved that in the hippocampus, astrocytes and their processes express Ephrin A3, \nwhile neurons express the Ephrin receptor EphA4. Interestingly, soluble Ephrin A3 \nwas sufficient to cause spine retraction in hippocampal slice cultures and transfecting \nneurons with a kinase inactive EphA4 resulted in longer spine extension. Together, \nthese experiments imply that this receptor-ligand interaction regulates spine shape by \n3.4.2 Glia Regulates Structural Plasticity in the Developing and Mature Nervous \nSystem"}

An ephA4 knockout mouse showed extension of spines in \nhippocampal slice cultures similar to dominant negative EphA4 transfected neurons, \nindicating that this receptor is required to maintain spine morphology (68). This \nwork suggests that, in addition to soluble factors released by astrocytes, there might \nbe bi-directional, contact-mediated, signaling between astrocytes and neurons that is \nimportant for maintenance of synaptic structure and number. Recently, timelapse \nimaging in mature hippocampal slices has shown that astrocyte processes and their \nneigbouring spines move cooperatively, further signifying a direct link between these \ntwo structures (39). In addition, a similar study using two-photon time-lapse imaging \nof astrocytic and dendritic processes revealed that dendritic protrusions with astro-\ncytic contacts had longer lifetime and were morphological more mature (75). They \nshowed that both motility of astrocytic processes and the Ephrin/EphA4 signaling \nbetween spines and astrocytes were necessary for astrocyte-dependent stabilization \nof newly generated dendritic protrusions. They proposed a model in which astrocytic \nprocesses are key local regulators of both the stabilization of individual dendritic \nprotrusions and their subsequent maturation into spines. \n \nA classical study supporting an active role for glia in developmental synaptic \nplasticity investigated the role of astrocytes in ocular dominance plasticity in the \nprimary visual cortex (66). During visual system development in animals with bin-\nocular vision such as cats or humans, inputs corresponding to each eye converge and \nestablish permanent connections in segregated columns in the visual cortex. This \ndivision of cortex into ocular dominance columns is an activity-dependent event, \nrequiring active inputs from both eyes. If the input from one eye is prevented by \neither lid suture (monocular deprivation) or tetrodotoxin injection, the columns from \nthe open eye expand extensively into the territory of the closed eye. This plasticity of \nsynaptic inputs, termed ocular dominance plasticity, occurs only during the first 4–7 \nweeks after birth in cat visual cortex. In addition, if the deprived eye is reopened \nanytime after 7 weeks after birth, the deprived eye can no longer regain its lost terri-\ntory; in contrast, if the eye is reopened before the end of this critical period, it can. \nThese events are known to depend on neuronal activity, NMDA receptors, and in-\nhibitory input (42). \n \nSeveral lines of evidence suggest that astrocytes may also play a role in ocular \ndominance plasticity. First, there is a temporal correlation between the critical win-\ndow for ocular dominance plasticity and the immature state of astrocytes in the cor-\ntex. In addition, dark rearing that is known to prolong ocular dominance plasticity \nalso prolongs astrocyte immaturity, as assessed by delay of expression of GFAP, a \nmarker of older astrocytes (65). Amazingly, when Muller and Best injected immature \nastrocytes from newborn kitten into the visual cortex of adult cats after the termina-\ntion of the critical period, ocular dominance plasticity period was reopened (66). The \nimplication of these results is that astrocytes play two roles in ocular dominance \nplasticity: immature astrocytes are instructive for synaptic plasticity, while mature \nastrocytes may help limit synaptic plasticity. \n \nCould maturation of astrocytes be a general signal for the end of critical period \nplasticity in the CNS? A study by Pizzorusso et al. suggests that chondroitan sulfate \nproteoglycan (CSPG), an extracellular matrix (ECM) molecule that is secreted by \nmature astrocytes, might be involved in the regulation of plasticity in the mature"}
{"text": "===== Page 15 =====\nGlia as Active Participants in the Development and Function of Synapses\n697\n \n \n \nvisual cortex (88). They found that the appearance of CSPGs in the visual cortex is \ntemporally correlated with the end of the critical period and that, like astrocyte matu-\nration, their appearance can be delayed by dark rearing. Could immature astrocytes \nbreakdown the limiting CSPG matrix thus reopen critical period plasticity? Indeed \nwhen Pizzorusso et al. dissolved the CSPG network in the brain enzymatically, the \ncritical period was reopened, mimicking the effect of immature astrocyte transplanta-\ntion observed by Muller and Best. This work implies that astrocytes can use secreted \nmolecules to signal the end of the critical period and alter synaptic plasticity. Are \nthere other molecules involved in astrocyte-regulation of synaptic plasticity? And \nwhat are the changes that astrocytes go through as they mature? Answering these \nquestions will surely broaden our understanding of CNS development. \n \nThere is also evidence that myelination may help signal the end of critical period \nplasticity in the brain (30). Myelin proteins, such as Nogo, myelin associated glyco-\nprotein (MAG) and oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMgp), are strong inhibi-\ntors of axon outgrowth and regeneration after injury. In part, they have been found to \ninhibit axon growth through their interaction with the Nogo-66 receptor (NgR), \nwhich is expressed by neurons. Interestingly, the period of ocular dominance plastic-\nity is dramatically prolonged in mice deficient in NgR (59). These findings suggest \nthat physiological NgR signaling is involved in ending the critical period, however \nthey fall short of demonstrating a role for myelin-associated NgR ligands as there is \nemerging evidence that these ligands are also localized to developing synapses. \n \nIn addition to their role in developmental plasticity, astrocytes have also been \nlinked to regulation of synaptic plasticity of the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus in \nthe adult. Activation of this system by release of oxytocin due to physiological con-\nditions such as parturition or lactation leads to a fast coordinated withdrawal of as-\ntrocytic processes that normally lie between neuronal cell bodies and innervating \ndendrites and the somatodendritic synapses (4\na significant increase in the number of GABAergic, glutamatergic, and noradrenergic \nsynapses as postsynaptic target sites, which were previously shielded by astrocytes, \nbecome available (107). In addition since the astrocytes have withdrawn from synap-\ntic sites, glutamate concentration at the synapse increases, leading to a dramatic \nincrease in neuronal excitability (87). It is possible that astrocyte-secreted ECM \nmolecules that regulate cell adhesion such as PSA-NCAM and Tenascin-C are in-\nvolved in these structural changes at the synapse (108). These studies also suggest \nthat astrocytes, most likely through their blood vessel-associated end-feet, can detect \nand respond to somatic stimuli that may be critical for the initiation of important \nstructural and functional plasticity in the adult CNS.  \n2). After astrocyte withdrawal there is \n \nIn conclusion, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes can regulate developmental struc-\ntural plasticity of the CNS through modulation of dendritic spine dynamics, ECM \nand myelination. Whether the inability of the CNS to regenerate after injury is actu-\nally a side effect of the glial regulation of plasticity remains an intriguing and impor-\ntant question."}

Role of Glia in Synaptic Transmission in the Mature Nervous \nSystem \n4.1 Activity-Dependent Neuron-Glia Communication at the Synapse \nThere is little question that glia perform several regulatory roles essential for normal \nneurotransmission and that there are many mechanisms by which glia indirectly \nregulate synaptic function. Astrocytic processes surround pre- and postsynaptic ter-\nminals where they rapidly clear and recycle ions and neurotransmitters from the \nsynaptic cleft. Astrocytes express high levels of glutamate transporters, GLAST \n(glutamate/aspartate transporter) and GLT1 (glutamate transporter1), which actively \nclear the synapse of excess transmitter. During neurotransmission, glutamate is taken \nup by astrocytes, converted into glutamine, and then released into the extracellular \nspace. Glutamine uptake by neurons is subsequently used to synthesize glutamate \nand GABA, the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Importantly, astrocytes \nalso protect neurons from excessive glutamate and other forms of excitotoxicity by \nboth regulating pH and buffering potassium and other ions released during neuro-\ntransmission.  \n \nIt is becoming increasingly clear, however, that glia also play a more direct role \nin modulating synaptic transmission. The notion that glial cells are active, excitable \ncells emerged with the advent of new techniques with which to study glia. The first \nclue that the close structural relationship between glia and synapses played an impor-\ntant role in modulating synaptic transmission came from the realization that peri-\nsynaptic glia, like their neuronal partners, express membrane receptors for most \nneurotransmitters (43). Although incapable of firing action potentials, glia can re-\nspond to neuronal activity via the activation of metabotropic neurotransmitter recep-\ntors. When activated, these neurotransmitter receptors promote the production of \nsecond messengers and the release of calcium from intracellular stores. Glial calcium \nsignaling is thus a measurable indicator of cell excitability, providing a powerful tool \nto study the activity of glial cells in action.  \n \nDo glia signal back to synapses? Activity-dependent activation of glial receptors \ncan induce the synthesis and release of several neuroactive substances, including \nATP (and its byproduct, adenosine), glutamate, and D-serine. Activity-dependent \nrelease of “gliotransmitters” affects synaptic activity in neurons and modulate synap-\ntic efficacy and plasticity. Time-lapse calcium imaging has demonstrated that glia \nsurrounding synapses respond to neuronal activity with increases in intracellular \ncalcium and that activity-dependent communication between glia and neurons is bi-\ndirectional. Chemical or mechanical stimulation of glia can in turn elicit calcium \nresponses in nearby neurons. Glia also actively communicate with each other \nthrough intercellular calcium waves. Stimulation of a single astrocyte can trigger a \nlocal elevation in astrocytic calcium that can subsequently spread to neighboring \nastrocytes in the form of a calcium wave. This section highlights examples of activ-\nity-dependent intercellular communication between neurons and glial cells in the \nCNS and PNS (Fig. 3)."}

Elegant electrophysiogical and \nimaging studies performed at the intact frog and mouse NMJ have demonstrated that \nperisynaptic SCs (PSCs) respond to high frequency stimulation of motor nerves with \nincreases in intracellular calcium (91, 94). Nerve-evoked calcium responses in PSCs \nare mediated the by the activation of purinergic and muscarinic receptors following \nthe release of ATP and acetylcholine from the presynaptic terminal (94). In addition, \nclassic neuromodulators such as neuropeptides and nitric oxide (NO) can fine-tune \nneurotransmitter-evoked calcium signaling in PSCs just as they do in neurons.

As we’ll discuss later, activation of \nPSCs by synaptic activity also leads to the regulated release of gliotransmitters that \ncan act presynaptically to modulate synaptic transmission and short term synaptic \nplasticity. \n \nThe retina has proven to be a valuable model system in which to study activity-\ndependent neuron glia communication in intact CNS tissue. Müller cells, specialized \nradial glia that expand almost the entire depth of the retina, actively communicate \nwith both astrocytes and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Müller glia express mem-\nbrane receptors for ATP and other transmitters and are responsive to mechanical, \nchemical and electrical stimulation. Importantly, natural stimulation of RGCs by \nrepetitive flashes of light elicited rapid calcium transients in Müller cells that were \nblocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX)(69). This activity-dependent response in Müller glia \nwas shown to be mediated by presynaptic release of ATP by neurons (69).  \n \nIt appears that synaptic control of glial excitation is widespread in the brain. \nElectrophysiological studies using acute brain slices have revealed active communi-\ncation between neurons and astrocytes following stimulation of neurons and their \nsubsequent release of transmitters (28, 116). A classic study by Porter and McCarthy \n(1996) demonstrated for the first time that astrocytes in acute brain slices respond to \nglutamate released directly from nerve terminals in an activity-dependent manner \n(89). Subsequent studies from a number of laboratories have shown that glial cal-\ncium increases are mediated by the synaptic release of transmitters that act on a \nvariety of astrocytic receptors including muscarinic receptors (1) and GABA recep-\ntors (47). Importantly, activity-dependent neuron-glial synaptic signaling also occurs \nin vivo under physiological conditions.  A recent study by Wang et al. provided \ncompelling evidence that astrocytes respond to sensory input in vivo. Two photon \nimaging in anesthetized mice showed that whisker stimulation evoked increases in \nastrocyte calcium levels within layer 2 of barrel cortex of adult mice (117). Sensory-\nevoked increases in astrocytic calcium were frequency-dependent and were mediated \nin part by ectopic glutamate release, which is in agreement with previous ex-vivo \nstudies.  \n \nBergmann glia, the specialized astrocytes of the cerebellum, are exquisitely sensi-\ntive to synaptic activity. Stimulation of cerebellar granule cells in acute slices in-\nduced rapid calcium transients in associated Bergmann glia (48). Similarly, electrical \nstimulation of parallel fibers elicited calcium signaling in Bergmann glia that was \nmediated by nitric oxide release (37, 57). Interestingly, Bergmann glia have hun-\ndreds of subcellular compartments termed ‘microdomains’ that wrap around syn-\napses and respond with increases in intracellular calcium following electrical stimu-\nlation (37). Bergmann glia, like neurons, are sensitive to the pattern and frequency of \nneuronal activity. Single pulse stimulation of parallel fibers evoked local calcium \nfluxes in microdomains, whereas multiple trains of pulses evoked much larger and \nsustained calcium increases in Bergman glia cell bodies and processes. Frequency-\ndependent neuron-glia signaling has also been demonstrated in hippocampal slices \n(80) and at the NMJ (46, 91, 93). That glia are sensitive to the pattern of neuronal \nfiring suggests that glia are capable of sensing and integrating information from \nneurons according to functional requirements of neural circuits."}

Direct activity-dependent neuron-glia communication \nwas recently demonstrated between NG2- positive oligodendrocyte progenitor cells \n(NG2 cells) and neurons. These small stellate-shaped cells are the newest subtype of \nCNS glia and they have attracted significant attention due to their widespread distribu-\ntion in the brain and their persistence in the developing and mature nervous system.  \n \nIn contrast to perisynaptic astrocytes and Schwann cells, which ensheath syn-\napses and respond to the ectopic release of chemical transmitters, electrophysiologi-\ncal and anatomical evidence indicates that NG2 cells form direct synaptic junctions \nwith both glutamatergic and GABAeric neurons. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings \nof NG2 cells in acute hippocampal slices revealed that NG2 cells responded to affer-\nent stimulation with the extremely rapid kinetics traditionally associated with neu-\nron-neuron synaptic communication. In addition to activating calcium signaling in \nNG2 cells, quantal release of neurotransmitter from neurons triggered rapid activa-\ntion of AMPA receptors and evoked postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in NG2 cells \n(8). These findings suggested that fusion of synaptic vesicles in neurons induced the \nbinding of glutamate to AMPA receptors on NG2 cells. Indeed, single NG2 cells \nprocesses were often located in direct contact with synaptic junctions (8). Although it \nis possible that ionotropic receptors on NG2 cells were activated by ectopic release \nof transmitter, electron microscopy analysis revealed that nerve terminals containing \nsynaptic vesicles formed synaptic junctions with the processes of NG2 cells. NG2 \ncells also express ionotropic GABA (A) receptors and direct GABAergic signaling \nbetween neurons and NG2 cells has also been observed (50). \n \nDirect rapid synaptic communication between NG2 cells and neurons is not lim-\nited to the hippocampus. NG2 cells are found in both grey and white matter through-\nout the developing and adult CNS (19, 49). In the molecular layer of the adult cere-\nbellum, climbing fibers from the inferior olive form direct synaptic connections with \nNG2 cells, in addition to Purkinje cells. In fact, it has been estimated that NG2 cells \ncan receive up to 70 inputs from a single climbing fiber. In addition, unlike Purkinje \nneurons, NG2 cells are often innervated by multiple climbing fibers, which suggests \na major role for NG2 cells in cerebellar circuitry. Indeed, activation of climbing fiber \ninputs resulted in excitatory AMPA synaptic currents in NG2 cells (51). Given their \nwidespread distribution, it is likely that direct signaling between NG2 cells and neu-\nrons is a general phenomenon. What is the functional significance of this rapid neu-\nron-glia signaling? This remains an important and open question. It may enable neu-\nrons to rapidly regulate gene expression in NG2 cells according to functional \nrequirements. Neurons could also rapidly signal NG2 cells to release gliotransmitters \nand signal back to pre- and postsynaptic neurons, as has been described for astro-\ncytes and perisynaptic Schwann cells. \n4.3 Glia to Glia Signaling \nActive communication between glial cells contributes an additional layer of com-\nplexity to synaptic signaling in the CNS.

Eroglu et al. \n \nneurons not only evoke local calcium oscillations in nearby glial cells, but can also \ntrigger calcium waves through glial networks, which might allow for the transmis-\nsion of synaptic signals over extensive cortical areas. \n \nIn culture, stimulation of a single astrocyte can trigger a local elevation of astro-\ncytic calcium that can subsequently spread to neighboring astrocytes in the form of a \ncalcium wave. Calcium waves can propagate at a rate of 100 μm/sec (18) and over a \ndistance of hundreds of micrometers (96, 28). Intracellular and intercellular calcium \nwaves involve the activation of G-coupled receptors, activation of phospholipase C, \nand the production of the second messenger IP3, which triggers calcium release from \nintracellular ER stores. Although these waves can occur spontaneously, the fre-\nquency and extent of calcium signaling can also be potentiated by mechanical, elec-\ntrical and chemical stimulation. \n \nWhat mechanisms underlie the propagation of calcium waves? Waves can be \ntransmitted to neighboring astrocytes via either the local diffusion of second messen-\ngers through gap junction channels or the release of “gliotransmitters” such as ATP \nalong astrocytic networks. Recent evidence suggests that these two mechanisms are \nlikely to work together to coordinate signaling between glial cells. Gap junction \nmediated propagation of calcium waves was the first such mechanism described in \nastrocytes (31), and there is now convincing evidence from a number of groups that \ndisruption of gap junction channels impairs the propagation of calcium waves in \nvitro and in vivo (83, 96). In addition, extracellular ATP released from stimulated \nastrocytes has been shown to propagate long-range calcium signaling via the activa-\ntion purinergic receptors (P2Y) on neighboring astrocytes (38). There is also evi-\ndence for a “point source ATP release” mechanism in which calcium waves are \npropagated via the release and diffusion of ATP from the stimulated cell and the \nactivation of purinergic receptors on neighboring astrocytes (4). The mechanism of \nATP release from astrocytes is still not clear. Possible mechanisms include calcium-\ndependent exocytosis and ATP release through connexin hemichannels (116). \n \nAn important question is whether propagating calcium waves through glia nor-\nmally occur in vivo. Currently there is little evidence that intercellular astrocytic \ncalicium waves occur under conditions considered to be physiological. Spontaneous \nand evoked calcium waves occur between Müller glia and astrocytes in the intact \nretina and other systems (28, 71), but there are clear differences in the extent and \nmagnitude of waves in different tissue preparations, which has led to confusion in \nthe field. Curiously, electrical stimulation generally fail to elicit large propagating \nastrocytic waves in most brain slice preparations (37, 48, 89) or in vivo (44, 74). \nInstead, calcium increases are typically observed in a few neighboring astrocytes in \nresponse to local stimulation. This, together with the realization that astrocytes are \norganized into distinct non-overlapping domains, suggests the existence of local \nastrocytic circuits (14, 106).  \n \nAre calcium waves physiological or pathological? It is clear that intercellular \nwaves can be induced in culture and in situ under more pathological conditions. \nPropagating waves have been observed in corpus collosum glia (99) and rat cortical \nslices (85) in association with spreading depression associated with ischemia and \ninjury. Schipke and colleagues demonstrated that ATP and activity- induced astro-\ncytic calcium waves can propagate over hundreds of micrometers in situ and can"}
{"text": "===== Page 21 =====\nGlia as Active Participants in the Development and Function of Synapses\n703\n \n \n \ntrigger responses in microglial cells (99). Recent advances in high resolution imaging \nand molecular approaches to study neuron-glia communication in anesthetized and \nawake behaving animals will hopefully shed light on these important issues (73, 74). \n \nAn important function of rapid intercellular communication among groups of \nastrocytes could be to modulate and coordinate the activity of neural circuits. Retinal \nganglion cells actively respond to waves of calcium that ripple through neighboring \nMüller glia (72) in situ. Increases in neuronal spontaneous and evoked activity occur \nin response to calcium waves in neuron-astrocyte co-cultures (3) and in intact tissue \nslices (28). Astrocytic calcium signaling also have important consequences for the \ncerebral vasculature. In addition to ensheathing thousands of synapses, astrocytic end \nfeet are also in direct contact with blood vessels. Recent time-lapse imaging experi-\nments provide convincing evidence that calcium increases in astrocytic endfeet can \nregulate blood flow in associated blood vessels (67, 122). In the retina, stimulation of \nglia in the intact retina can evoke dilation or constriction of arterioles (61). Although \nthe mechanisms underlying astrocyte-vessel signaling are still unclear, these recent \nfindings point toward a possible role for astrocytes in controlling vasculature func-\ntion and possibly dysfunction in pathophysiological conditions and disease. \n4.4 Glia-Neuronal Signaling at the Synapse \nGlia rapidly respond to synaptic activity, but can glia signal back to the synaptic \nterminal to influence synaptic function? This question has been investigated exten-\nsively over the past decade in several model systems and more recently in vivo. It is \nnow well established that activated glia can release neuroactive molecules including \nATP (21, 70, 118), glutamate (77), inflammatory cytokines (9), vasoactive molecules \n(123) and D-Serine (64) that could signal back to pre- and postsynaptic terminals to \nmodulate synaptic activity and function. \n \nPerhaps the best example of glial modulation of synaptic transmission in vivo \noccurs at the mammalian NMJ. Perisynaptic SCs at the mammalian and amphibian \nNMJs respond to the release of Acetylcholine and ATP from the presynaptic termi-\nnal with robust increases in intracellular calcium (91, 46). It is well established that \nrepetitive stimulation of motor neurons induces synaptic depression by decreasing \npresynaptic transmitter release. Recent research implicates the perisynaptic Schwann \ncell (PSC) as a major player in this form of synaptic depression. Activation of PSCs \ninduced release of a chemical signal from PSCs that stimulated nitric oxide produc-\ntion at the NMJ. This glial induced NO release mediates synaptic depression by \ndecreasing the probability of presynaptic acetylcholine release (110). \n \nWhat is the functional consequence of this activity-dependent neuron-glia com-\nmunication? Perisynaptic Schwann cells can both positively and negatively influence \nsynaptic transmission, depending on the types of glial signaling pathways activated \nduring synaptic transmission. Sustained IP3- dependent calcium influxes in peri-\nsynaptic Schwann cells can regulate synaptic strength (17); conversely, synaptic \nactivation of G-protein coupled signaling cascades in Schwann cells can affect synaptic \ndepression as described above. Together these findings suggest that activity-dependent \nactivation of specific signaling cascades in terminal Schwann cells can integrate synap-\ntic activity and directly influence neuronal activity and synaptic efficacy."}
{"text": "===== Page 22 =====\n704 \nC. Eroglu et al. \n \n \nThe first evidence that astrocytes can directly modulate the activity of adjacent \nneurons came from studies using neuron-glial co-cultures. Araque and colleagues \nfound that elevations in intracellular calcium in astrocytes (by electrical or mechani-\ncal stimulation) resulted in a corresponding slow inward current in hippocampal \nneurons. They went on to show that calcium-dependent release of glutamate from \nastrocytes enhanced the frequency of postsynaptic currents in neurons by acting on \nextrasynaptic NMDA receptors (3, 77). Glutamate was later shown to mediate astro-\ncyte-neuron signaling in acute brain slices. Fiacco and McCarthy (27) recorded from \nCA1 pyramidal cells in acute brain slices while evoking Ca2+ increases in the adja-\ncent stratum radiatum astrocytes. They used whole-cell patch clamping to deliver \ncaged IP3 and a Ca2+ indicator dye to astrocytes. Uncaging IP3 in astrocytes pro-\nduced a propagating calcium wave that spread into fine distal astrocytic processes \nthat perfectly coincided with a significant increase in the frequency of AMPA spon-\ntaneous excitatory post synaptic currents (sEPSCs) in CA1 neurons. Recent evidence \nalso suggests that astrocytes may be a necessary mediator in activity-dependent \nmodulation of inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus. Stimulation of interneurons \nelicited a GABA(B)-receptor-mediated elevation of calcium in surrounding astro-\ncytes, which in turn potentiated inhibitory transmission (47).  \n \nATP is a key signal mediating the propagation of astrocytic calcium waves, rais-\ning the question of whether astrocytic ATP release might regulate synaptic transmis-\nsion. In the retina, electrical activity of retinal ganglion neurons (RGCs) is depressed \nin response to glial calcium waves that propagate through the retinal ganglion cell \nlayer (72). It turned out that Müller glia inhibited RGC firing via the release of ATP, \nwhich was converted to adenosine by ectotidonucleases and activated adenosine \nreceptors on RGCs (70). A very similar process has been recently demonstrated in \nacute hippocampal slices. Glial-derived adenosine acts on presynaptic A1 receptors \nin neurons leading to inhibition of calcium channels, a decreased probability of ve-\nsicular release and reduced frequency of sEPSCs (79). Glial mediated synaptic de-\npression has also been demonstrated in cerebellar slices in the case of depression of \nPurkinje neurons by Bergmann glia (12). Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated \nthat ATP release from glia can also positively regulate synaptic transmission. ATP \nactivation of postsynaptic ionotropic P2X receptors increases postsynaptic intracellu-\nlar calcium levels, which is thought to regulate insertion of AMPA receptors, thereby \nincreasing excitatory synaptic transmission (35). \n \nIt has been proposed that astrocytes may normally release vesicle-stored gluta-\nmate in vivo at synapse like contacts onto neurons, but recent studies suggest that this \nis unlikely. Regulated glutamate release by astrocytes has been measured in culture \nand several mechanisms of release have been proposed including: calcium-dependent \nexocytosis, volume-sensitive ion channels, gap junction hemichannels, and the large \npore of the ionotropic P2X7 ATP receptor (78). There is little evidence, however, \nthat glutamate can normally accumulate in astrocytes in vivo. To directly address the \nquestion of whether stimulation of calcium waves in astrocytes induces them to \nsecrete signals that are sufficient to activate nearby neurons, Fiacco et al., (2007) \nconstructed transgenic mice that express a Gq-coupled receptor specifically in astro-\ncytes (29). This enabled them to use an agonist that would activate calcium waves \nspecifically in astrocytes. Despite widespread calcium elevations in astrocytes,"}
{"text": "===== Page 23 =====\nGlia as Active Participants in the Development and Function of Synapses\n705\n \n \n \nnearby neuronal activation could not be detected. These new findings call into ques-\ntion the popular notion that calcium-dependent release of glutamate or other glio-\ntransmitters by astrocytes directly affects neuronal synaptic activity in vivo.  \n5. Role of Glia in Synaptic Plasticity \nAs we discussed in the previous section, glia have the ability signal to neurons \nthrough neuromodulators and neurotransmitters that affect pre- and/or postsynaptic \nfunction. This signaling between glia and synapses establishes glia as a major player \nin the regulation of the functional plasticity at the synapse. Indeed, recent literature \nshows that several factors secreted by glia play an active role in activity-dependent \nmodulation of synaptic efficacy, a process that is known to contribute to neural cir-\ncuit development and experience-dependent plasticity. \n \nThe most well known forms of synaptic plasticity are long-term potentiation \n(LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which involve rapid adjustments in the \nstrength of individual synapses in response to specific patterns of correlated synaptic \nactivity. The postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors, AMPA receptors \n(AMPAR) and NMDA receptors (NMDAR), are thought to be central players in \nthese plasticity processes through the regulation of their surface delivery, retention \nand calcium channel properties (22, 100). NMDARs contain a glutamate binding site \nas well as a site for glycine, a coagonist that is required for the opening of the cal-\ncium channel. In the past decade an unlikely amino acid D-serine emerged as a po-\ntent agonist for this site. Interestingly, D-serine is exclusively produced by the glial \nenzyme serine racemase, which converts L-serine to D-serine (63). D-serine is se-\ncreted by astrocytes through a vesicular release process that is dependent on \nAMPAR activation in glial cells. This indicates that the glutamate, which is released \nonto perisynaptic astrocyte processes by neurons during synaptic transmission, could \nbe a signal that induces D-serine secretion by astrocytes (97, 98).  \n \nInterestingly, neuronal activity-dependent release of D-serine might be necessary \nfor hippocampal LTP (121). When Yang and colleagues cultured hippocampal neu-\nrons in contact with astrocytes, the neurons were capable of undergoing LTP; how-\never neurons grown in ACM without direct astrocytic contact were not. The addition \nof exogenous D-serine restored the ability of neurons grown in ACM to undergo \nLTP. These data suggest that astrocytes are actively involved in synaptic plasticity \nby regulating the availability of D-serine, released at perisynaptic astrocyte proc-\nesses. Recently Panatier and colleagues looked at the function of D-serine mediated \nNMDAR signaling in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (76), a system in which \nstructural changes in astrocyte association with synapses are known to be important \nfor the oxytocin-mediated responses at synapses. They provided compelling evi-\ndence that in this hypothalamic structure the endogenous co-agonist of NMDA re-\nceptors is D-serine rather than glycine. Therefore, the degree of astrocytic coverage \nof neurons governs the level of glycine site occupancy on the NMDA receptor, \nthereby affecting their availability for activation and thus the activity dependence of \nLTP/LTD (76). In conclusion, D-serine released by astrocytes is a major regulator of \nNMDA function thus a potent regulator of synaptic plasticity."}
{"text": "===== Page 24 =====\n706 \nC. Eroglu et al. \n \n \nIn addition to regulation of NMDAR function, surface delivery of AMPARs is \nthought to be an important mechanism in the regulation of LTP and LTD. Beattie et \nal. showed that the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha released by glia enhanced \nsynaptic efficacy by increasing surface expression of AMPA receptors (7). Blocking \nTNF-alpha signaling had opposite effects. The authors suggested that the continuous \npresence of TNF-alpha is crucial for the preservation of synaptic strength at excita-\ntory synapses. Interestingly, even though TNF-alpha increased surface AMPAR \nexpression, LTP and LTD were not affected in its absence (104). \n \nHomeostatic synaptic scaling, a second form of synaptic plasticity, involves uni-\nform adjustments in the strength of all synapses on a cell in response to prolonged \nchanges in the cell's synaptic activity such as blockade of synaptic function. This \nregulation might be critical for preventing neural networks from becoming unstable \nand dysfunctional (13). The mechanisms responsible for synaptic scaling have gen-\nerally remained a mystery, with the exception of evidence that regulation of receptor \ncontent at synapses might be involved (84). Stellwagen and Malenka showed that \nTNF-alpha mediates synaptic scaling in response to prolonged activity blockade \n(104). Using mixtures of wild-type and TNF-alpha-deficient neurons and glia, they \nwere able to illustrate that glia are the source of the TNF-alpha involved in this synap-\ntic scaling. Since TNF alpha is secreted by microglia in response to injury, TNF-alpha \nmediated synaptic plasticity might modulate neural responses to injury and neurode-\ngeneration such as Alzheimer disease. Further studies will be necessary to address \nwhether such TNF-alpha signaling is present in vivo under normal developmental \nconditions or whether it is an injury mediated adaptation mechanism. Characterization \nof the underlying molecular mechanisms through which TNF-alpha can induce \nAMPAR surface expression will also improve our understanding of this phenomenon.  \n \nAnother synaptic plasticity mechanism that requires coordinated regulation of \nsynaptic function is heterosynaptic depression. This phenomenon was first noticed in \nthe retina and was later shown to be mediated by the ability of an active synaptic \npathway to laterally regulate the relative strength of neighboring synapses (55). Such \na mechanism is also present in hippocampus and it entails the specific depression of \nan unstimulated pathway in the presence of another independent pathway in which \nLTP is induced (56). This inter-synaptic communication is regulated by adenosine \nthrough A1 receptors (56). Recently, vesicular release by astrocytes was reported to \nbe crucial for heterosynaptic depression (79). To do so they created a transgenic \nmouse line in which a dominant negative SNARE domain that is known to inhibit \nvesicular exocytosis was specifically expressed in astrocytes using a GFAP pro-\nmoter. Heterosynaptic depression was prevented in these mice despite the fact that \nLTP could still be potentiated. They also showed that this effect was mediated by \nsecreted ATP, which is converted to adenosine and accumulates at the synapse to \nmediate its inhibitory function through A1 receptors. These results provide evidence \nthat ATP released by astrocytes is required for heterosynaptic depression. An impor-\ntant caveat is that the conclusion that the vesicular ATP derives from astrocytes \ndepends on the absolute specificity of dominant negative SNARE expression in \nastrocytes. This specificity might be difficult to achieve with the GFAP promoter, as \nGFAP is expressed in some neural stem cells, which could thus give rise to neurons \nthat also express the dominant negative SNARE construct."}
{"text": "===== Page 25 =====\nGlia as Active Participants in the Development and Function of Synapses\n707\n \n \n \n \nTo investigate the trigger of glial ATP release, Serrano and colleagues tested \nwhether Ca2+ activation of glial cells was necessary for heterosynaptic depression \n(101). Indeed, a rise of intracellular Ca2+ in glial cells, induced by activation of glial \nGABA (B) receptors, was required for heterosynaptic depression. This effect could \nbe inhibited by blocking ATP degradation, indicating that ATP-adenosine signaling \nwas downstream of Ca2+ signaling in glia (101). Taken together these results indicate \nthat GABA released by inhibitory neurons activates Ca2+ signaling in astrocytes, \nwhich leads to secretion of ATP. This ATP is then converted to adenosine in the \nextracellular space, where it activates A1 receptors on the post-synaptic excitatory \nneuron, inducing synaptic depression. The presence of this regulatory network \nmodulating heterosynaptic depression is an elegant example of how neuron-glia/glia-\nneuron interactions mediate complex plasticity processes in the brain.  \nIn conclusion, there is overwhelming evidence that glia use their ability to respond to \nneurotransmitters and secrete neuromodulators to actively regulate a number of \nprocesses involving synaptic plasticity. \n6. Concluding Remarks \nIt is becoming increasingly clear that glia play a crucial and dynamic role at the \nsynapse and influence functions that have long been thought to be strictly under \nneuronal control. The inclusion of glial cells as active participants at the synapse is \ngradually shifting long-standing neurocentric perspectives on how the brain works. \nGlial signals help promote both the formation and elimination of synapses as the \nbrain wires up during development. Once the appropriate synaptic connections are \nformed, glial cells then influence their maintenance and stabilization in the mature \nCNS and PNS. We now appreciate that glia are well equipped to actively communi-\ncate with pre and postsynaptic neurons at the tripartite synapse. This dynamic two-\nway dialogue can directly influence synaptic transmission and several well studied \nmechanisms of synaptic plasticity, including LTP and synaptic scaling. Over the past \ndecade, an exciting new field has emerged, and neuroscientists are gradually begin-\nning to appreciate a more “gliocentric” view of the synapse (Fig. 4).  \n \nThe recent work reviewed here lays a strong foundation for understanding the \nmany roles that glia play in synapse development and function, and paves the way \nfor many future studies. Several important and open questions remain including:  Do \nastrocytes (and other glia) control the location and timing of critical period plastic-\nity? What are NG2+ progenitor cells doing in the adult brain and what is the function \nof their direct synaptic contacts with neurons? Why are astrocytes organized into \nnon-overlapping anatomical domains? Could glia actively influence neural circuits to \ncontrol information processing? Do glia release gliotransmitters and directly control \nsynaptic function in vivo? As glia are crucial for the normal structure and function of \nsynapses, it has been difficult to dissect out their normal role in synapse function and \nbehavior in vivo. Recent advances in the power of live imaging has allowed us to \nobserve glia in action, but there is still a need for better molecular tools to study and \nmanipulate specific types of glial cells at the right place and time in vivo. Regardless, \nthe exciting new findings highlighted here lay a strong foundation in new area of \nneuroscience, in which there is much to explore and re-explore."}

McNamara et al. \n \nThe mechanisms underlying the plasticity of the mossy fiber synapses with CA3 \npyramids contrast sharply with mechanisms of plasticity of the Schaffer collateral \nsynapse with CA1 pyramids and most other cortical synapses. Whereas induction of \nLTP of the Schaffer collateral synapse with a CA1 pyramid requires NMDA recep-\ntors, induction of LTP of the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramid synapse is not dependent \nupon NMDA receptors. Moreover, whereas expression of NMDA receptor-\ndependent LTP is mediated by insertion of AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic \nmembrane of the CA1 pyramids (31), the expression of NMDA receptor-independent \nLTP at the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramid synapse is mediated by increased release of \nglutamate from the mossy fiber terminals (37).   \nAt least two distinct mechanisms underlie LTD of the mossy fiber synapses with \ninterneurons in stratum lucidum. Common to each mechanism of LTD is the re-\nquirement for elevation of calcium postsynaptically (27). At synapses containing \ncalcium-permeable AMPA receptors, expression of LTD resides presynaptically, \nmediated by a reduction of glutamate release. At synapses containing calcium-\nimpermeable AMPA receptors, expression is mediated by removal of AMPA recep-\ntors from the postsynaptic membrane as occurs in LTD of Schaffer collateral syn-\napses with CA1 pyramidal cells (27).  \nThe striking divergence of HFS-induced plasticity at distinct terminals of the \nmossy fiber axons implies remarkable compartmentalization of the molecular signal-\ning events underlying these plasticities.

That is, field potential recordings reveal that the \ndentate granule cells fire synchronously at high frequency during a seizure in vivo \n(25), a firing pattern predicted to result in LTP of the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramid \nsynapse as well as LTD of the mossy fiber-interneuron synapses.   \nAnalyses of mossy fiber-CA3 pyramid synapses in hippocampal slices isolated \nseveral weeks after chemoconvulsant (kainic acid) induced status epilepticus provide \nevidence that the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramid synapse had indeed undergone LTP in \nvivo (16).

Interestingly, interneurons in stratum lucidum are among the \nmost, if not the most, sensitive CNS neurons to death induced by either status epilep-\nticus or global ischemia (30, 5). Thus these neurons may have been absent from the \nhippocampal slices isolated from kainic acid treated animals in which LTP of the \nmossy fiber-CA3 pyramid synapse was identified (16).

To-\ngether with in vitro studies of the effects of high frequency stimulation of mossy \nfibers, it seems likely that the high frequency firing of the granule cells and their \nmossy fiber axons during status epilepticus induced LTP of the mossy fiber-CA3 \npyramid synapse.  \nThe question arises as to whether signaling through TrkB might contribute to LTP of \nthe mossy fiber-CA3 pyramid synapse during limbic epileptogenesis. As noted \nabove, evidence of enhanced activation of TrkB has been identified in the mossy \nfiber pathway in multiple models of limbic epileptogenesis (9, 19). Among potential \ncellular consequences of TrkB activation that might promote limbic epileptogenesis, \nLTP of excitatory synapses on principal neurons is an attractive possibility. We \ntherefore asked whether TrkB activation may be required for LTP of the mossy fiber-\nCA3 pyramid synapse. To address this question, we analyzed the mossy fiber-CA3 \npyramid synapse in hippocampal slices acutely isolated from WT and TrkB condi-\ntional null mutant mice (22). Analyses of the mf-CA3 pyramid synapse in slices \nfrom TrkB conditional null mutants revealed paired pulse facilitation (PPF) of the \nfEPSP similar to that found in slices of WT mice. By contrast, the increase of the \nfEPSP induced by high frequency stimulation of the mossy fibers was reduced by \napproximately 60% in slices from TrkB conditional null mutant mice compared to \nWT littermate controls, thereby demonstrating a requirement for TrkB in LTP of the \nmossy fiber-CA3 pyramid synapse. Preventing LTP of the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramid \nsynapse may be one mechanism by which the conditional deletion of TrkB prevents \nepileptogenesis in the kindling model (18)."}

McNamara et al. \n \n6 Perspective and Questions Arising \nIt seems likely that the “gatekeeper” function assigned to the dentate granule cells of \nhippocampal formation does serve to limit seizure propagation through the normal \nentorhinal-hippocampal circuitry. It further seems plausible that plasticity of the \ngranule cell synapses contributes to the impaired gatekeeper function evident in \nepilepsy models. We suspect that the enhanced functional connectivity involves LTP \nof the mossy fiber synapse with CA3 pyramids as well as a compromise of the mossy \nfiber-evoked feedforward inhibition of the CA3 pyramids. With respect to the latter, \nthe compromise of the feedforward inhibition is likely mediated by death of the \nspiny interneurons in stratum lucidum in some models of epilepsy (e.g. status epilep-\nticus models). In other models of limbic epilepsy where these interneurons survive, \nwe suspect that LTD of the mossy fiber synapse with these interneurons may con-\ntribute. \nThat said, the perspective advanced above raises a series of important questions. \nStarting with plasticity of these synapses, what is the signaling cascade triggered by \nTrkB activation that leads to LTP of the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal cell synapse? \nWhat is the cellular locale at which the TrkB must be activated, a mossy fiber bouton \nor CA3 dendritic spine? Is BDNF the key ligand activating TrkB? How does TrkB \nsignaling interact with identified molecules required for LTP of the mossy fiber-CA3 \npyramid synapse including GluR6, EphB2 receptor, Rab3a, PKA, RIM1α, and other \nsignaling proteins (37)? Also unclear is whether TrkB signaling is required for LTD \nof the mossy fiber synapses with interneurons in stratum lucidum. With respect to \nthe gatekeeper function and its proposed defects, the in vitro studies provide a strong \nrationale for testing the integrity of the “dentate gate” in vivo in animal models of \nlimbic epilepsy. Addressing this question is entirely feasible using multiple elec-\ntrodes recording local field potentials and single unit activity in entorhinal cortex and \nvarious hippocampal regions in chronic models. This will permit testing not only the \nintegrity or lack thereof of the dentate gate but also the potential role of temporoam-\nmonic projections directly to CA1 in propagation of seizure from entorhinal cortex \n(4). Finally, developing causal inference as to the role of the granule cells and their \nsynapses in epileptogenesis in vivo will be facilitated by engineering mice in which \ngene expression can be selectively and conditionally regulated in the dentate granule \ncells of the mature animal. This will permit a determination of how regulating activ-\nity of granule cells as well as plasticity of their synapses impacts epileptogenesis in \nvivo. \nAcknowledgments \nThis work was supported by NS056217 from the National Institute of Neurological \nDisease and Stroke (J.O.M.) and an Epilepsy Foundation postdoctoral fellowship \n(Y.Z.H)."}

This is a so-called “clot-busting \ndrug”, which will aid the dissolution of a clot. This treatment is counter indicated in \nhemorrhagic stroke. No neuroprotective drugs to preserve or protect brain \nparenchyma are currently available and approved by the FDA. Unfortunately with \nthe recent failure of the SAINT II trial (Stroke Acute Ischemic NXY-059 Treatment), \ninterest in spin trap reagents (free radical scavengers) has been reduced (101, 102). \nGiven the increasing prevalence of stroke in the community, which may be related to \nthe increasing population age, it seems imperative that additional therapeutic options \nbe identified.  \n2.4 Experimental Models to Study Stroke and Ischemia – In vivo Models \nof Stroke \nThere are multiple experimental models used to study stroke, because of this caution \nis needed in interpreting sometimes conflicting results from different models. \nDifferent studies may employ different techniques of inducing ischemia, different \nspecies or strain of experimental animals, different brain regions for study and \ndiffering techniques to determine infarction area/volume and functional effects. \nExperimental ischemia can be permanent, or transient (temporary) whereby the cause \nof reduced perfusion is removed, i.e. withdrawal of an occluding filament. \nFocal ischemic models attempt to recapitulate the situation of disrupted local \nblood flow to a specific area of the brain. Probably the most common model is the \nfilament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. While commonly used, due to the \nease of controlling the reperfusion of the tissue, filament insertion may exacerbate \ninjury following ischemia due to damage to the vascular endothelium (25). Other \nfocal models include electro-coagulation and chemical-coagulation of blood vessels \n(112) on the surface of the brain. While similar to human stroke the duration of \nischemia is more variable in these models, and distal thrombosis may induce \nsecondary infarctions. As an alternative, endothelin-1 has been used to induce \nconstriction in the cerebral blood vessels, which can be reversed by an antagonist, \nThe nature of damage following focal and global ischemia, as well as the \ndevelopment of damage (progressive vs. completed) is determined by the choice of \nmodel used to study ischemia. Global ischemia models are performed to reduce \nblood flow to the entire brain. Common models are the 2-vessel occlusion (whereby \nthe bilateral carotid arteries are clamped and systemic blood pressure reduced) or 4-\nvessel occlusion (most commonly used in rat) whereby the vertebral arteries are \npermanently occluded by ligature or cauterizing and then the carotid arteries are \ntransiently occluded by aneurysm clips (95, 113). Some studies have employed a \ncardiac arrest model whereby the heart is stopped for a varing duration (by KCl \ninjection), and then resuscitated (chest compressions, intravenous epinephrine, and \nventilation with 100% O2)."}

(For a review \nof ischemia models see (14, 113)). \n2.5 Experimental Models to Study Stroke and Ischemia – In vitro \nModels of Ischemia \nMost studies of in vitro ischemia utilize primary cultures of cortical or hippocampal \ncells (18), although immortalized neuronal and neuronal like cells have been used \n(55, 56). These cultures however vary between study groups, regarding age of \ncultures, growth media, species (mouse vs. rat) and date of tissue preparation \n(embryonic vs. post-natal). Most studies focus on the effects of ischemia on neuronal \ncell populations, however in vitro systems can be used to study astrocyte and \noligodendrocyte responses (4, 40). Of note while in general astrocytes tend to show \nhigher resilience to ischemia than neurons, protoplasmic astrocytes may have a \nsimilar vulnerability to ischemia as neurons (40). Organotypic slices have also been \nused for the study of ischemia. \nThere are a number of methods to mimic ischemic conditions. Hypoxia/anoxia \ncan be induced by placing cells in a solution where oxygen is removed or lowered by \nbubbling the solution with an anaerobic gas mixture or by placing cells into a \nhypobaric/anoxic chamber (80). Hypoglycemia can be modeled by the removal of \nglucose, or its replacement with a non-metabolized variant (2-deoxy glucose) (115). \nMitochondrial inhibitors, for example potassium cyanide or 3-nitopropionic acid \n(115, 117), have been used to model the metabolic inhibition that occurs following \nischemia,. Ischemia also induces glutamate release and excitotoxicity, hence many \nstudies have focused on the effects of high concentrations of glutamate or the \nselective agonist N- methyl-D Aspartate (NMDA).  \n2.6 Physiology and Biochemistry of Brain Ischemia \nIschemic conditions in the brain rapidly deplete neurons, and to a lesser extent \nastrocytes, of the metabolites oxygen and glucose that are necessary for energy \nproduction. Energy loss results in a rundown of the electrochemical gradients of ions \nacross membranes, notably Ca2+ and K+, leading to depolarization of cells and \nneurotransmitter release (59). The rapid rise in intracellular calcium, via influx from \nvoltage and ligand-gated calcium ion channels can activate calcium sensitive \nproteases such as calpain and cathepsin resulting in protein degradation. \nThe brain, when subject to focal ischemia, can be divided into two regions. The \nportion of the brain subject to the most extreme ischemic conditions exhibits rapid \ncell death and is termed the ischemic core. The region surrounding the ischemic core \nis termed the penumbra. The penumbra is also vulnerable to ischemia-induced cell \ndamage but cell death evolves over a slower time course. The slower progression of \ncell death enables the penumbra to be salvaged by attenuating neurochemical cell \ndeath processes. In this regard, ischemia activates a complex series of biochemical \nand molecular processes in the core and penumbra, which have been covered \nextensively in a number of reviews (28, 34, 45, 69, 76); the following is a brief \noverview."}
{"text": "===== Page 5 =====\nStroke-A Synaptic Perspective \n735\n \n \n \nIn the ischemic core, the combined loss of energy and ion gradients results in \ncell swelling, compromising the cell membrane and leading to the release of cell \nconstituents and cell death. The mitochondria of cells in the ischemic core show \nswelling and rupture of contents. Associated with this rapid passive cell death is an \naccompanying inflammatory response. Released cell constituents (K+ and glutamate) \nmay then cause a cascade effect resulting in further damage to adjacent cells. Raised \nextracellular K+ can also induce the release of glutamate from astrocytes via reversal \nof uptake transporters (24). Extracellular glutamate may evoke calcium mediated \nglutamate release from astrocytes (104). Hence once these conditions of high \nextracellular glutamate and potassium are obtained, they can overwhelm \ncompensatory mechanisms leading to excitotoxic “necrotic” cell death.  \n \n \nFig. 2.

Caspase 3 also cleaves ICAD (inhibitor of CAD), \nresulting in the activation of CAD (caspase activated deoxynuclease), which cleaves \nDNA into regular sized packages (50–300-kb). These biochemical cascades and \nsubsequent DNA damage render the cells committed to die. The complex nature of \nthis cell death cascade reveals many potential therapeutic targets, although to date \nnone have been used successfully in clinical trials (76).  \n3 Evidence Implicating the Synapse in Mediating Ischemia-\nInduced Brain Damage \n3.1 Synaptically Released Glutamate Mediates Excitotoxicity Following \nIschemia \nEarly work on the retina showed that excessive levels of the excitatory amino acid \naspartate resulted in brain damage and neurodegeneration termed excitotoxicity (87). \nExcitotoxicity due to excessive brain glutamate levels was suggested as a potential \nmechanism of injury in stroke and other acute/chronic neurological disorders (77). \nTwo pieces of evidence strongly support the role of the synapse in mediating the \neffect of ischemia. First, it was shown that cutting the pre-synaptic inputs to the CA1 \nregion of the hippocampus blocks global ischemia induced neurodegeneration (11) \nand that ischemia induced cell death in vitro is attenuated by blocking synaptic \nrelease of glutamate with tetanus toxin (85) Second, glutamate receptor antagonists \nattenuate ischemia-induced brain damage in animal models of global ischemia and \nstroke (78). Indeed, this latter observation initiated the large interest in NMDA and \nglutamate receptor acting drugs as potential therapeutics for stroke.  \n3.2 NMDA Receptor Antagonists as a Therapy for Stroke: Potential and \nPitfalls \nSince these initial experiments, glutamate receptor blocking agents have been shown \nto be effective in reducing ischemia induced brain damage in a variety of species \n(rat, mouse, hamster, gerbil, cat, primate) and ischemia models (focal, global \ntemporary permanent and in vitro models). However, it should be noted that some of \nthe neuroprotective effects of MK801 may be due to its ability to reduce body \ntemperature (61). Yet it is of note that even though it is over thirty years since the \ninitial experiments proving that blockade of excitatory amino acid receptors blocks \nischemia induced brain damage, not a single compound has to date been successful"}

Furthermore some NMDA \nblocking compounds show unacceptable side effects such a psychosis (ketamine) or \nvacuolation of the brain (MK801: dizocilpine) (51). One significant issue is the that \ntime window for therapeutic NMDAR blockade, at least in rodents is slender, up to \none hour following the ischemic event (97). Such a short therapeutic time window \nmakes it unlikely that a patient presenting with stroke symptoms will be given an \nNMDA blocking compound within the effective time range. Indeed this may also be \na reason for the failure of the SAINT II trial of free radical blocking agents in stroke \n(101). However, one potential solution is to identify therapeutic combinations that \nextend the therapeutic time window of NMDA receptor antagonists. It has recently \nbeen shown that combination of an ASIC1 receptor blocker PcTX (see previous \nchapter) with the NMDA antagonist memantine enhanced the therapeutic time \nwindow of the NMDA blocker following ischemia (92). This suggests that \ncombinations of neuroprotective agents may provide more effective therapeutic \noptions for treating stroke than a single compound alone. Indeed this approach has \nproved effective in cancer therapy, whereby multiple cytotoxic compounds are \ncombined.  \nThe failure in clinical trials of NMDA receptor antagonists and the SAINT trial \nalso highlight some of the limitations of studies assessing neuroprotective potential \nof an agents using in vivo models of stroke. For example, in in vivo models the test \nagent is frequently administered at the time of ischemia induction, rather than at time \npoints more equivalent to clinical response times (3–6 hours post ischemia). As such, \nnumerous recommendations have been made from the review of failed clinical trials \nof neuroprotective agents with recommendations for future studies (27, 35, 101, \n102).  \n3.3 Physiological and Pathological NMDA Receptor Signaling: Cell Fate \nin the Balance \nAnother compelling reason for the apparent failure of NMDA antagonists concerns \nthe apparent Yin/Yang effects of NMDA receptor signaling. On the one hand, \nactivation of NMDA receptors has been shown to mediate pro-survival physiological \neffects, such as CREB transcription factor activation and BDNF expression (50, \n116). \nHowever, \nexcessive \nactivation \nof \nNMDA \nreceptors \npromotes \nneurodegeneration and cell death. In a series of experiments, Biegnon showed that \nthe prolonged blockade of NMDA receptors is detrimental if administered hours \nfollowing traumatic brain injury. Indeed, administration of a low dose of NMDA \nagonist (NMDA) results in less brain damage than the administration of the NMDA \nantagonist MK801 in the TBI-injured mice (6)."}
{"text": "===== Page 8 =====\n738 \nR. Meller and R.P. Simon \n \nThe results of the Beignon study leads to two intriguing suggestions. First, that a \nweak partial agonist of NMDA receptors may actually be a more therapeutically \neffective therapy. A weak partial agonist would antagonize excessive endogenous \nactivation of a given receptor, yet maintain a low level of tonic activation of the \nreceptor if endogenous activation falters. This approach is currently in clinical trials; \nthe NMDA antagonist memantine may be a weak partial agonist.  \nThe second suggestion regards the nature of NMDA receptors and their \ncontribution to physiological and pathological signaling. Hardingham showed that \nfollowing blockade of synaptic receptors on neurons, further NMDA stimulation \nresulted in toxicity, which was attributed to the activation of extra-synaptic receptors \n(49, 50). Other groups have shown that NMDA toxicity is not blocked by loss of \nspines (100), e.g. following the removal of dendritic spines with latrunculin (an actin \nde-stabilizing agent). These data suggest that toxic NMDA signaling exists when \neither synaptic NMDA receptors are blocked or following removal of dendritic \nspines (and presumably the synaptic receptors). This implies that toxic NMDA \nsignaling is mediated through extra-synaptic NMDA receptors.   \nHowever, ischemia induced excitotoxicity may exert its toxic signaling effects \nthrough synaptic NMDA receptors, and not extrasynaptic receptors. For example, \nremoval of dendritic spine heads, following exposure of neurons to the actin \ndepolymerizing agent latrunculin, blocks ischemia-induced cell death in vitro (100). \nThis suggests that ischemia induced cell death may be reliant on synaptic signaling \nmechanisms and synaptic NMDA receptors that are activated by endogenous \nsynaptic glutamate that is released during energy failure. This concept is supported \nby the observation that cutting pre-synaptic inputs to the CA1 neurons of the \nhippocampus blocks ischemia-induced neurodegeneration (11). Furthermore \nblocking synaptically released glutamate with tetrodotoxin blocks oxygen glucose \nmodeled ischemia induced cell death in vitro (85). However what is not clear from \nthe experiments of Sattler et al. (100) is what happens to synaptic NMDA receptor \nsubunits following latrunculin treatment, and whether latrunculin induces changes to \nall NMDA receptors, or whether its effects are subtype specific (NR2A vs. NR2B).  \nIn a recent study it was suggested that blockade of NR2B subunits, irrespective \nof synaptic location mediates neurotoxic NMDA-receptor mediated signaling, but \nNR2A subunits were pro-survival. This suggests that selective enhancement of \nNR2A, but reduction of NR2B mediated signaling may offer a new therapeutic \nmechanism for stroke. Unfortunatly, the polyamine site NR2B glutamate receptor \nsubunit selective antagonist Eliprodil was withdrawn from clinical trials in 1997, \nreducing the enthusiasm of NR2B subunit selective NMDA receptor antagonists as a \ntherapeutic option for stroke (see (120)). Hence the challenge for one future direction \nof neurprotective stroke research is to devise a mechanism whereby physiological \nsignaling can be maintained, but toxic NMDA signaling can be selectively \nattenuated. Interestingly, endogenous protective mechanisms may indeed mimic this \nsituation, and are considered later on in the chapter.  \nTaken together the role of the synapse in mediating ischemia induced damage to \nneurons is implicated by a number of studies, but ischemia can also result in \nprofound changes to the synapse. These mechanisms may be part of a \nneuroprotective response to the ischemia, or a result of excitotoxic signaling."}

However, synaptic changes are evident in areas subject to \nnon-harmful ischemic where the loss of function can be temporary or reversible. The \nform and function of the synapse are intertwined, for simplicity we consider the \neffect of ischemia on synaptic morphological and then the effect of ischemia on \nsynaptic function.  \n4.1 Methods to Study Synaptic Structure Following Ischemia \nStructural studies have been performed using both in vitro and in vivo stroke models \nto determine the morphological effects of ischemia. In vitro studies have allowed the \n“real time” assessment of dendritic structures through the application of fluorescence \nand confocal microscopy. Typically immunocytochemistry, fluorescent proteins, \ntagged actin or lipophilic fluorescent membrane dyes are used in these studies.

The spine loss is recoverable if the \nischemia is transient and non-harmful, but is persistent when toxic levels of ischemia \noccur (88, 124). It should be noted however that neurons in the penumbral region \nthat recover spines may yet be lost at a later time point. The recovery of spines takes \napproximately 2–4 hours (88). Interestingly the recovery of the spines occurs at the \nsame location on the dendrites that the spines were originally lost both in vitro (52) \nand in vivo (124). Spine loss is similar when toxic and non-toxic ischemia or \nexcitotoxic stimuli are used, leading to the suggestion that spine loss may be a \nprotective phenotype (see later).  \n \n \nFig. 4.

{"text": "===== Page 11 =====\nStroke-A Synaptic Perspective \n741\n \n \n \nThe mechanisms regulating spine loss following ischemia have not been \nthoroughly studied, rather many studies have focused on the mechanisms of NMDA-\ninduced morphological changes. NMDA activates protein phosphatase 2B, \ncalcineurin, which causes actin depolymerization and may be responsible in part for \nspine loss. However, actin depolymerization alone is insufficient to remove spines \nfrom dendrites. Latrunculin treatment of hippocampal cells results in a loss of the \nspine head, but the shaft is still evident (100). In contrast, incubation of hippocampal \ncells with NMDA results in loss of the entire spine (44, 52, 53). This suggests \nadditional mechanisms are responsible for the spine loss and rather than just actin \nremodeling. Interestingly, latrunculin treatment does prevent spine recovery \nfollowing NMDA treatment (52).  \nNMDA may regulate spines via the activation of proteolytic enzymes. NMDA-\nmediated activation of the proteolytic enzyme cathepsin D degrades MARCKS: a \nprotein, which is responsible for anchoring the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma \nmembrane (44). Calpain however does not regulate spine loss, but calpain blockers \nslow the recovery of spines following NMDA treatment (32). The ubiquitin-\nproteasome system may also play a role in the loss of MARCKs following brief \nischemia, and contribute to synaptic remodeling (Meller: unpublished results). This \nsuggests that brief ischemia may remodel the synapse via the selective degradation \nof actin-associated elements.   \n4.3 Varicosity Formation in Neuronal Dendrites Following Ischemia \nA second feature following ischemia is the appearance of beaded varicosities along \nthe dendrites. These varicosities have been reported in response to excitotoxic \nstimuli and were originally considered cell death indicators resulting from \nexcitotoxicity (86). The varicosities occur in the same time period as spine loss is \nobserved (88). Interestingly, more varicosities are observed on proximal dendrites \nfollowing ischemia, than those in close proximity to the cell soma (Meller; \nunpublished observations). Microtubule associated proteins (MAP2A/MAP2B etc.) \nhave been shown to be cleaved following ischemia, and they accumulate into the \nvaricosites (12). The formation of varicosities following ischemia is not inhibited by \na calpain inhibtor, MDL 28, 170, however the recovery of varicosities following \nNMDA treatment was slowed in the presence of MDL28,170(32). More recent data \nshow that varicosity formation and excitotoxic cell death occur through independent \nmechanisms; death is Ca+2 mediated while varicosities are mediated by Na+2 flux and \nAMPA internalization (64). The functional consequence of varicosity formation is \nnot clear, but may also serve as a protective function, as they may help \ncompartmentalize calcium to reduce calcium overload (64). Indeed, varicosity \nformation by NMDA induces a transient, reversible neuroprotective state by \nattenuating excitatory neurotransmission (64). Thus the varicosity formation as well \nas spine loss following ischemia may be part of a protective response."}

Simon \n \n5 Ultrastructural Changes in the Brain Following Ischemia \nA number of ultrastructural studies have helped to shed light on the effect of global \nischemia on selectively vulnerable neurons, especially damage to the CA1 pyramidal \nneurons of the hippocampus. Most of these studies involve observations made on \nbrain sections prepared for electron microscopy.  \n5.1 Presynaptic Membranes are Tolerant of Ischemia \nPre-synaptic membranes are not as affected by global ischemia as the post synaptic \nsurface. The pre-synaptic membrane and glia show temporary swelling, which is \nreversible within one hour (31, 57). This is consistent with the lack of permanent cell \ndamage to astrocytes and pre-synaptic neurons in global ischemia models (67, 82). \nOne common observation is that astrocyte end feet are swollen, and appear to reduce \nthe extracellular space (31), which may have implications for synaptic transmission. \nFollowing ischemia, vesicle aggregation is observed in pre-synaptic terminals, and \nsome synaptic boutons show a reduction in vesicle number (31, 118). This may \ncorrelate to ischemia/reperfusion induced vesicular release of glutamate, and other \ntransmitters. The morphological changes to the pre-synaptic terminal and astrocytes \nappear temporary and return to relatively normal levels within one to three hours \nfollowing the ischemic insult.  \nFurther support for the robustness of the pre-synaptic neurons in global ischemia \ncomes from multiple experiments, and not just ultra-structural studies. Global \nischemia induces cell death in the CA1 field of the hippocampus but not the \ninnervating cells. Following global ischemia, potassium evoked glutamate release \ncan still be measured using microdialysis a few days after the ischemic insult (82). \nHistological analysis of these brains show that the post-synaptic cells were lost, but \nthe pre-synaptic axons appear to withstand the ischemic shock. In a study by \nHasbani, the pre-synaptic labeled cells appear relatively stable, following exposure \nto NMDA (52). In comparison the post synaptic dendritic spine shrinks, but \nreappears following wash out of the NMDA. This apparent robustness of pre-\nsynaptic boutons to ischemia may also serve to guide dendritic spines back to their \noriginal contacts. However, one week following global ischemia pre-synaptic bouton \nnumbers are reduced, which may be due to a lack of target sites in fields where \nneurons have degenerated (58).  \n5.2 Postsynaptic Membranes are Vulnerable to Ischemia \nIschemia induces more morphological defects in the post-synaptic region, compared \nto the pre-synaptic terminal. Following ischemia, modifications of the post-synaptic \ndensity (PSD) have been reported, including projections of electron dense material \n(the consequence of this is as yet unclear). The PSD becomes irregular following the \nischemic insult. The PSD is thicker and discontinuous 20–60 minutes following \nreperfusion (31). Apparent breaks in the PSD correspond to the breaks in the post-\nsynaptic membrane at 1 hour. A disruption or compromise of the post-synaptic \nmembrane is consistent with the observation that post-synaptic sites take up"}
{"text": "===== Page 13 =====\nStroke-A Synaptic Perspective \n743\n \n \n \nexogenous HRP (horse radish peroxidase) following ischemia (although the HRP is \nassociated with cell membranes and so may be due to endocytotic mechanisms rather \nthan cell lysis) (26). The potential of post fixation to induce the membrane breaks \nshould also be considered. One unusual observation (albeit with unknown \nsignificance) is the formation of pockets in the post-synaptic membrane, which are \nfilled by the pre-synaptic membrane, but no PSD is present in the “buckets “ (31).  \nOne hour following ischemia, many studies report the swelling of post-synaptic \nmembranes and changes in the morphology of internal organelles: mitochondria \nappear swollen with a loss of the cristae, the endoplasmic reticulum appears swollen, \nvacuoles form in the cytoplasm and poly-ribosomes are disintegrated into single \nunits (31, 57, 118). Some cells also start to show signs of chromatin clumping \nfollowing ischemia. Microtubules in axons and dendrites also appear to show \nkinking and breaks following ischemia, which may correspond to the formation of \nvaricosities (see above).  \nThe thickening of the post synaptic density in ischemic-vulnerable CA1 \nhippocampal neurons can last 4–24 hours following global ischemia, where as in the \ndentate gyrus (which is less vulnerable to ischemia) changes in the PSD thickness \nreverse 24 hours following the ischemic insult (74). This thickening of the PSD may \ncorrespond to an enhanced NMDA receptor mediated facilitation (signaling) \nfollowing ischemia in CA1 neurons or be associated with ischemic damage to the \npost-synaptic region. Hence the persistent modification of the PSD may be a marker \nor a cause of the delayed cell loss in the CA1 following global ischemia.  \nThe thickening of the PSD following ischemia may also involve the denaturation \nof proteins. Ubiquitinated protein aggregates have been reported to occur following \nischemia, especially in synaptic preparations (70). If proteins are present but \ndenatured (62), this may lead to a decrease in signaling function of synaptic proteins. \nSince multiple proteins in the post-synaptic density are targets for ubiquitination \n(30), this may affect post synaptic receptor signaling following ischemia. \nFewer studies have investigated long term changes to the structure of the brain \nfollowing harmful ischemia. There is evidence to support reinnervation of some \nareas lost following an ischemic insult. One week following ischemia there is a \npersistent decrease in synaptic number in the hippocampus. In particular there is a \nreduced number of asymmetrical synapses, which correlate with excitatory synapses \n(58). However there is an increase in glutamate in the remaining synaptic boutons of \nthe hippocampus, which may be a compensatory mechanism for the initial loss of \ncells following ischemia (58). In the short-term, presynaptic markers levels (GAP43) \ndo not change following ischemia, but at 2 weeks changes were apparent (increased \nprotein expression) (47, 71). This may coincide with reinnervation of damaged areas \nor a recovery in function. Recently, realtime in vivo two-photon imaging has \ndemonstrated up to 5-fold higher rates of spine formation in neurons near the infarct \nborders (10). It is notable that the brain is capable of recovering function following \nthe loss of discrete brain regions due to ischemia."}
{"text": "===== Page 14 =====\n744 \nR. Meller and R.P. Simon \n \n6 Functional Effects of Ischemia on Synaptic Transmission  \nMany studies have been performed using global ischemia to determine the effects of \nharmful ischemia on synaptic transmission (123). Such studies are performed using \nthe global model of ischemia, where the maturation of injury in the vulnerable CA1 \nregion of the can be compared to dentate gyrus or CA3 cells, which are resistant to \nthe effects of ischemia. While it is assumed that regions of the brain exposed to \nhypoxic conditions will show greatest functional deficits following ischemia, it is of \nnote that in a receptor study Zhang and Murphy showed that functional deficits \nextended on average up to 400 µm from areas with damaged dendrites indicating \nsynaptic function may even be compromised in the structurally intact penumbra \n(125). \n6.1 Rapid Onset of Synaptic Depression During Ischemia \nWhen cells are subject to hypoxia there is an initial depression or failure of synaptic \ntransmission (108). This may be due to the rapid energy deletion in the cells \nfollowing the onset of ischemic conditions. The synaptic depression is reversible if \nthe duration of ischemia is short. The CA1 cells of the hippocampus show a rapid \ndecrease in population spike response to stimulation following ischemia, compared \nto dentate gyrus cells.  \n6.2 Anoxia-Induced Spreading Depression \nIf ischemia is prolonged the cells suffer a spreading depression type event, which has \nsome similarities to normoxic spreading depression (108). Interestingly while some \ndrugs are able to delay the time of onset of spreading depression in brain slices, no \ndrugs have been shown to produce blockade (108). The consequence of this period \nof depolarization is not fully understood but may play a role in the post ischemic \nenhancement of synaptic transmission. The ability of the brain to recover from this \ndepolarization is inversely proportional to the time exposed to spreading depression \n(108). The timing of the spreading depression may contribute to two features of post \nischemic responses. First the spreading depression may result in excessive release of \nthe excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, which may activate NMDA receptors \nleading to enhanced intracellular calcium levels. Second, the spreading depression \nmay also account for some of the post-ischemic abnormalities in synaptic \ntransmission. \nFollowing recovery from ischemia the neuronal responses may appear normal or \nenhanced, but drop off between 8 and 24 hours following ischemia, a time interval \nthat corresponds to that of CA1 neuronal loss. It must be noted that this mechanism \nof cells dieing off after a period of re-perfusion in global ischemic models is distinct \nfrom the cell death following irreversible immediate hypoxic damage usually \nobserved in the core of a focal ischemic infarct (commonly referred to apoptosis vs. \nnecrosis, but see (106)). Following global ischemia, there is a temporary decrease in \ninhibitory synaptic transmission, but this is not as prolonged as the enhancement of \nexcitatory transmission (15)."}
{"text": "===== Page 15 =====\nStroke-A Synaptic Perspective \n745\n \n \n \n6.3 Enhanced Postsynaptic Responses Following Ischemia \nProlonged post-synaptic glutamate receptor activation may result in an apparent \nincrease in EPSP amplitude up to 12 hours following an ischemic episode (21, 22, \n37, 38, 83). Enhanced NMDA responses have been termed post ischemic long term \npotentiation, in that it shows some similarities to long term potentiation induced by a \ntetanic stimulation under normoxic conditions. The potentiation is due to the \nincreased synaptic efficiency in post ischemic hippocampal CA1 neurons following \nischemia. Post ischemic LTP can be blocked by NMDA receptor antagonists, which \nmay account for the ability of some glutamate antagonist studies to show a reduction \nin cell damage when administered following global ischemia (84). Calcium chelating \nagents can also block post ischemic LTP, but unlike tetanic LTP AMPA antagonists \nare not effective (21).  \nA number of mechanisms may account for the enhanced response of NMDA \nreceptors following ischemia. Ischemia decreases ATP, changes pH, increases \nglycine release, activates protein kinases (PKC) and results in reducing conditions, \nall of which have been shown to enhance NMDA receptor currents (21). Some \nstudies suggest that the increased expression of the NMDA receptor 2C subunit \n(NR2C) following ischemia may account for enhanced NMDA responses (66, 107). \nNR2C subunits have a reduced magnesium blockade of the channel resulting in \nenhanced calcium influx and prolonged opening of the channel. Hypoxic LTP \nrequires a strong depolarizing event to be induced, and one potential candidate could \nbe anoxic spreading depression, which is observed following ischemia.  \nThe enhanced NMDA response in CA1 regions may also lead to additional \ncomplications in the brain following stroke. Following ischemia there is an increased \noccurrence of epileptic seizures. NMDA receptors regulate burst firing in the CA1 \npost ischemic, but in some recent studies the CA3 was shown to have a lowered \nseizure threshold following global ischemia (19). Enhanced seizure susceptibility \noccurs 2–3 weeks following the primary ischemic insult. \n6.4 Changes in NMDA Receptors Following Ischemia \nFollowing global ischemia there is a reduced expression of NMDA receptor subunits \n(123) which probably correlates with the loss of cells from the CA1 following injury. \nThese decreases are blocked by administration of NMDA receptor antagonists at the \ntime of ischemia (again supporting the view that ischemia induced cell death \ninvolves excitotoxicity). Following ischemia there is also a calpain sensitive \ncleavage of the NR2A and NR2B receptor subunit C termini (39, 121), which may \nalso enhance receptor signaling. Interestingly the post ischemic induction of LTP, \ncell death and reduction of NR2B subunits is blocked by the NMDA receptor 2B \nsubunit selective antagonist ifenprodil (91). Other studies have reported that NR2B \nmediated signaling is toxic (50).  \nThe interaction of the NMDA receptor with the postsynaptic scaffold may also \nresult in enhanced NMDA function. Following ischemia there is an increased \nphosphorylation of NMDA receptor subunits by the tyrosine kinases Src Fyn, and \nPyk (17). The phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B receptor subunits has been"}
{"text": "===== Page 16 =====\n746 \nR. Meller and R.P. Simon \n \nlinked to hyper-excitability of the cell and cell death. Disruption of PSD-95 \ninteractions with NMDA receptors, or reduction in its expression by antisense \noligonucleotides reduced NMDA receptor subunit phosphorylation and ischemia \ninduced cell death (2, 60). Hence the downstream intracellular signaling components \nof the NMDA receptor scaffold may offer new targets for anti-stroke therapies \n7 Role of the Synapse in Ischemic Tolerance \nTolerance is the biological phenomenon whereby a brief sub toxic exposure to a \nstimuli (preconditioning) renders the cell, organ or organism protected against a \nnormal toxic exposure to the same stimuli. In ischemic tolerance, brief exposure to \nsubtoxic ischemia (albeit sufficient to elicit a response in the tissue) renders the brain \n(or heart) tolerant to subsequent normally injurious levels of ischemia (29). The \nprotection induced by preconditioning can render the system protected from other \nharmful stimuli as well, for example endotoxin (lipo-poly saccharide¨LPS) can \ninduce tolerance to ischemia, and seizures or spreading depression can also induce \nischemic tolerance (29). Tolerance to ischemia can occur over two time frames, rapid \ntolerance occurs within minutes and lasts approximately one hour, delayed tolerance \nrequire 24–72 hours to be maximal and is lost after 7 days (29).  \n7.1 Multiple Intracellular Mechanisms Regulate Ischemic Tolerance \nStudies of neuroprotection in ischemic tolerance usually revolve around the study of \nan induced protective gene following preconditioning. Central to this is the \nobservation that long term ischemic tolerance is blocked by protein synthesis \ninhibitors, which suggests that it requires de-novo protein synthesis (5, 79, 80). \nLong-term ischemic tolerance is also blocked by RNA synthesis inhibitor \nactinomycin D (Meller, unpublished observation). Ischemic tolerance following \npreconditioning with ischemia is inhibited by NMDA receptor antagonists (7, 111), \nbut this may be specific to the nature of ischemic preconditioning (i.e. requiring a \nsynaptic event).  \nIschemic tolerance induced by ischemic preconditioning is blocked by \npharmacological and genomic inhibition of Protein Kinase A (PKA), p42/44 \nmitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), calcium/calmodulin activated protein \nkinase (CAMK) and AKT (42, 80). Each of these protein kinases have been shown \nto be activated following synaptic activation of NMDA receptors, although the exact \nmechanism linking these protein kinases remains to be determined. Activation of \nthese protein kinases has been shown to drive multiple transcription factors and \nCREB activation has been shown by a number of groups to regulate ischemic \ntolerance. Blocking CREB phosphorylation, interaction with CBP or CRE promoters \nhas been shown to block ischemic tolerance (48, 80). Interestingly, the prosurvival \nprotein bcl-2 contains a CRE promoter (36, 94, 119) and blocking CREB function \nblocks bcl-2 expression and ischemic tolerance (48, 72, 80).  \nHowever, apart from bcl-2, numerous genes and proteins have been touted as \nmediating protection in tolerance paradigms, including heat shock proteins, other"}
{"text": "===== Page 17 =====\nStroke-A Synaptic Perspective \n747\n \n \n \nanti-apoptotic proteins e.g. Bcl-w, changes in expression of glutamate transport \nproteins EAAT2/3 and erythropoietin (23, 75, 81, 98, 99). When one considers a \nmechanism for ischemic tolerance, one must take into account the nature of the \npreconditioning agent as well the nature of the harmful event, as this may have lead \nto misleading generalizations regarding common mechanisms of ischemic tolerance. \nFor example, induction of heat shock proteins have been shown as a potential \nmechanism of ischemic tolerance (16, 122), but ischemic tolerance is induced at a \nlower insult threashold than required to induce HSP expression (3). This does not \nrule out heat shock proteins as a relevant mechanism of inducing tolerance to \nischemia, but suggests other mechanisms may be more relevant for spreading \ndepression induced protection.  \nMany agents may induce long term (protein synthesis dependent) tolerance, \nhowever the mechanisms by which this tolerance is acquired may be quite different. \nComparison of the genomic profile of ischemic preconditioning is quite different \nfrom other preconditioning agents, and no one common mechanism appears to result \nin protection. One potential explanation for this is not that preconditioning agents \ncause the same induction of protective genes, but rather they cause a reprogramming \nin the genomic response to normally harmful ischemia, thereby changing the cells \nfate. This has indeed been shown in ischemic tolerance using microarray profiling. \nStenzel Poore et al. showed that the genomic overlap of infarcted cortex and tolerant \ncortex subject to harmful ischemia show no common regulated genes (110). Thus the \ngenomic response to ischemia was “reprogrammed” by preconditioning the brain by \nbrief ischemia and that this reprogramming produced protection. What remains to be \ndetermined is whether the different preconditioning agents also induce the same \nreprogramming effect or whether each stimuli not only induces its own pattern of \nprotective gene expression but also its own re-programming effect, based of the \ngenes expressed by the preconditioning agent. Stenzel-Poore has suggested that the \ntolerizing agent (ischemia, LPS) dictates the mechanism of protection to subsequent \nischemia (109). Ischemic preconditioning induces a hibernation-like phenotype, the \ndown regulation of high energy utilizers such as transporters and channels (110). In \ncontract LPS down regulated inflammatory mediators and upregulates anti \ninflammatory mediators (109).  \n7.2 Is Synaptic Function Changed in Delayed Ischemic Tolerance? \nSince ischemia tolerance induced by ischemic preconditioning can be blocked by \nNMDA receptor antagonists (43, 111), this would suggest that tolerance pathways \nare activated following ischemia-induced activation of NMDA receptors. However, \nno clear pattern of expression of synaptic proteins is induced by preconditioning or \nthe tolerant state in microarray studies (110).  \nHowever, preconditioning ischemia may induce changes to synaptic \ntransmission via indirect mechanisms. Microinjection of Bcl-XL into pre-synaptic \nterminals enhances post-synaptic responses and the rate of recovery from synaptic \ndepression (65). In contrast an N-terminal cleaved Bcl-XL, which is pro-apoptotic, \nreduced post-synaptic responses. The effect of bcl-2 family proteins on the cell may \ndepend on the developmental stage of the neuron. Loss of Bak results in reduced"}

Simon \n \nGABA-ergic inhibition and enhanced seizure-like activity in young mice exposed to \nthe excitatory amino acid analogue, kainite (33). However, in mature mice, loss of \nBak renders cells protected against ischemia (33). Therefore in the case if ischemic \ntolerance, where Bcl-2 expression is increased (8, 80, 105), a change in the balance \nof pro-survival vs. pro cell death proteins may result in changes in mitochondrial \nfunction and therefore synaptic function.  \nIschemic preconditioning may induce long-term changes to the synapse. A \nrecent study reported that 3–30 days following preconditioning ischemia there is a \nhigher number of dendritic spines compared to control (20). Increased spine number \nis usually associated with an increase in vulnerability to ischemia and other \nexcitotoxic stimuli. This suggests that long-term changes occur in the brain \nfollowing preconditioning, out lasting the neuroprotective period.  \n7.3 Rapid Ischemic Tolerance  \nNeurons also become tolerant to harmful ischemia one hour following \npreconditioning ischemia: a process termed rapid ischemic tolerance (79, 89, 90, 96). \nThis form of tolerance is mediated by biochemical mechanisms in the brain. \nBlocking protein synthesis does not block rapid ischemic tolerance (79), suggesting \nit is not dependent on new protein synthesis. A complement of protein kinases \nappear to mediate rapid ischemic tolerance including p42/44 mitogen-activated \nprotein kinase (MAPK), protein kinase C (PKC) and AKT (79, 96), but not protein \nkinase A (PKA) or calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase (CAMK) (Meller \nunpublished results).  \n7.4 Proteasomal Degradation of Structural Proteins in Rapid Ischemic \nTolerance Leads to Dendritic Spine Remodeling \nRapid ischemic tolerance is blocked by inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome \nsystem (79), which is implicated in the regulation of synaptic signaling (30). Our \nrecent studies have identified a number of proteins implicated in post-synaptic \ndensity regulation and signaling as being ubiquitinated, and potentially degraded one \nhour following preconditioning ischemia. Of particular focus, we identified the actin \nbinding proteins MARCKS and fascin as being ubiquitinated and degraded. The loss \nof these proteins appears to result in re-organization of the actin cytoskeleton, \nalthough rapid acting calcium mediated processes following NMDA receptor \nactivation, such as calpain, may also account for some of the rapid re-organization of \nactin.  \nA direct consequence of actin reorganization is the loss of dendritic spines on the \nneurons, which are therefore unable to make synaptic contacts. The loss of dendritic \nspines following ischemia has been reported in neurons in vitro following ischemia \n(53), but the role of the ubiquitin proteasome system has not yet been investigated. \nWe showed that the proteasome inhibitor reduces the number of spines lost at one \nhour. Whether the proteasome directly mediates spine loss or speeds up the spine \nrecovery is currently under investigation."}

A reduction in dendritic spine number has been \nassociated with the ischemia tolerant effect of hibernation in artic ground squirrels \nand European hamsters (73, 93, 114). Hence the remodeling of dendritic spines \nfollowing transient sub-toxic ischemia appears to be a protective mechanism.  \n7.5 Reduced Excitotoxicity of NMDA in Rapid Ischemic Tolerance \nThe remodeling of the post-synaptic membrane may not just be mediated by changes \nto the actin cytoskeleton. The loss of dendritic spines one hour following \npreconditioning ischemia, would no doubt have an effect on synaptic transmission. \nWe have also discovered that at the time of spine loss in preconditioned cells, \nNMDA-mediated cell death is reduced. The tolerance to NMDA excitotoxicity is \nblocked by a proteasome inhibitor, which also blocks the reduction in spine number \nat one hour following preconditioning ischemia (See Fig. 5). This suggest that \npreconditioning ischemia results in a selective inhibition of post-synaptic toxic \nglutamate signaling in cells, via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, yet NMDA \nfunction (CREB phosphorylation) and receptor subunit expression levels were not \neffected by the preconditioning ischemia (not shown).  \nThe loss of NMDA toxicity following preconditioning ischemia, suggest a \nselective loss in pathological NMDA signaling that may account for the tolerance to \nischemia. These studies agree with that of Aarts, who showed that disruption of the \ninteraction of PSD-95 with NMDA2A/2B receptors blocks ischemia induced cell \ndeath, but not NMDA electrophysiological responses (2). Further this result agrees \nwith Sattler whereby remodeling of dendritic spines results in protection to ischemia \n(100). However in that study, dendritic remodeling using latrunculin (an actin \ndepolymerizing agent) only protected against ischemia and not NMDA toxicity. In \ncontrast ischemic preconditioning protects against toxicity induced by both ischemia \nand NMDA. Our data suggest that preconditioning induced protection, involves \nmore than just actin re-organization, rather the ubiquitination of post-synaptic \ndensity associated proteins results in a protective phenotype. Hence preconditioning \ncells with ischemia results in protection to toxic NMDA signaling from extra-\nsynaptic sites as well as synaptically derived ischemia – induced neurotoxicity.  \nSummary and Concluding Remarks \nIschemia induces profound changes to the synapse, both in terms of mediating the \ndeath of cells following toxic ischemia, and the remodeling of synapses in response \n   \nFig. 5. (Continued) ischemia a reduction in dendritic spine number (arrow heads) and \nincreases in varicosity (*) formation is observed (d). Compared to control cells (e), varicosity \nformation (*) is highlighted by an accumulation of MAP2 following preconditioning ischemia \n(f). (g) The loss of spines and the formation of varicosities is blocked by a proteasome \ninhibitor MG132. (h) NMDA tolerance induced by preconditioning (PC) is also blocked by \nthe proteasome inhibitor MG132. Taken together we suggest that following preconditioning \nischemia the protein degradation mediated by the proteasome results in morphological \nchanges in the spines, resulting in endogenous protection to excitotoxicity."}

{"text": "===== Page 2 =====\n112 \nP.S. McPherson et al. \n \n \n2 Models of SV Fate \n2.1 Maintenance of SV Integrity in the Plasma Membrane \nFollowing exocytosis SVs may maintain their unique character within the presynap-\ntic plasma membrane (Fig. 1, left). In support of this notion, Willig et al. (174) used \nSTED (stimulated emission depletion) microscopy to follow the fate of synaptotag-\nmin I, an integral protein of the SV membrane. STED microscopy reduces the focal \nspot of a light microscope to an order of magnitude below the diffraction limit, \nthereby allowing the analysis of individual SVs. Intriguingly, synaptotagmin I re-\nmained clustered in isolated patches on the plasma membrane whether SV fusion \nwas triggered by mild or intense stimulation, suggesting that SVs maintain their \nintegrity in the plasma membrane (174). A recent proteomic and lipidomic analysis \nof purified SVs revealed an extremely high protein packing density such that trans-\nmembrane helicies may occupy more than a quarter of the entire SV membrane vol-\nume (153). Because lateral diffusion of proteins within the plasma membrane is \ndecreased at high protein density (43), it is possible that SVs could retain their iden-\ntity as a lipid and protein microdomain that does not diffuse laterally in the plasma \nmembrane. Moreover, clustering of SV proteins within the presynaptic membrane \ncould be aided by cholesterol, which represents approximately 40% of the total lipid \ncontent of SVs (103). A proteomic analysis reveals that many components of SVs \nand the endocytic machinery are enriched in cholesterol-rich domains of synaptic \nmembranes (71). The integrity of the SV microdomain need only be maintained for a \nfew seconds before the endocytic machinery could form a clathrin coat to stabilize \nthe cargo for CME. Maintaining the integrity of SVs within the plasma membrane  \n \nclathrin (4, 8, 49, 58). Such clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) at the synapse can \nbe viewed as a specialized form of the “house-keeping” process that mediates inter-\nnalization of receptors and other protein and lipid cargo in all cell types (115).  \n \nIt is widely thought that the major endocytic mechanism for retrieval of SV pro-\nteins and the recycling of functional SVs following exocytosis is based on the protein \n \n \nThe main purpose of this chapter is to review the molecular mechanisms involved \nin CME of SVs. However, to understand the task faced by this synaptic endocytic \nmachinery, it is first important to understand the fate of SV membranes and mem-\nbrane proteins once they are transiently incorporated in the plasma membrane. At \nleast three different scenarios are possible (Fig. 1): SV membranes and membrane \nproteins retain their unique identity within the plasma membrane; SV proteins dif-\nfuse but are captured by an endocytic scaffold that is organized around the active \nzone, the site of SV fusion; SV proteins diffuse broadly throughout the plasma mem-\nbrane. We will discuss each model in turn."}

{"text": "===== Page 4 =====\n114 \nP.S. McPherson et al. \n \nwould greatly simplify the task of reformation of SVs as the endocytic machinery, in \ntheory, would need to target only one key protein in order to selectively retrieve all \nSV components. \n2.2 Diffusion with Capture in an Endocytic Active Zone \nA second model proposes that SV proteins diffuse within the plasma membrane \nfollowing SV exocytosis, but are then captured in an endocytic active zone that sur-\nrounds the exocytic active zone (Fig. 1, center). One candidate scaffold protein for \nthe organization of such a functional endocytic microdomain is dynamin-associated \nprotein of 160 kDa (Dap160) (139). Dap160 is the Drosophila homologue of inter-\nsectin-short (intersectin-s), an endocytic protein of mammalian cells composed of \ntwo Eps15 homology (EH) domains, a coiled-coil region, and five tandem Src ho-\nmology 3 (SH3) domains (176). Intersectin-s localizes to clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) \nand interacts with numerous components of the machinery for CME including the \nlipid phosphatase synaptojanin and the GTPase dynamin (63). In the neuromuscular \nsynapse of Drosophila, Dap160/intersectin-s is concentrated in a peri-active zone \nregion, which is also enriched in the adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) (47). As described \nbelow, AP-2 is a central factor in the nucleation of clathrin coats and the organiza-\ntion of the endocytic machinery. In Drosophila, loss-of-function mutants for Dap-\n160/intersectin-s have impaired SV endocytosis and are unable to sustain high-\nfrequency neurotransmitter release (81, 94). Further, essential endocytic proteins are \nlost from the synapse in Dap-160 null Drosophila. Thus, the organization of the \nendocytic machinery around the active zone may provide a barrier to diffusion of SV \nproteins, such that the proteins would incorporate into nascent, perhaps preformed, \nCCPs followed by CME and SV reformation. \n2.3 Broad Diffusion in the Plasma Membrane \nAn alternative model regarding the fate of SV proteins is that they diffuse broadly \nwithin the plasma membrane following exocytosis (Fig. 1, right). This would create \nthe challenge of sorting and retrieving a large number of proteins at low concentra-\ntions. One possible mechanism to partially overcome this difficulty has been recently \nreported (39, 172). Using antibodies against the luminal domain of synaptotagmin I \nor tagged versions of synaptotagmin I and vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 \n(VAMP-2; also called synaptobrevin 2), it was demonstrated that significant pools of \nthese integral SV proteins reside in the synaptic and axonal plasma membrane at rest \nand thus provide a reservoir of SV proteins that can be tapped during stimulation and \nCME (39, 152, 172) (Fig. 1). The surface reservoir would lessen the demands on the \nendocytic machinery by providing a high concentration of proteins for selection and \ninclusion in endocytic vesicles."}

In fact, until as late as the early 1990s, the activities of clathrin and AP-2 \nseemed sufficient to explain how cargo-laden CCVs were generated, at least in non-\nneuronal systems. We now recognize that clathrin and AP-2 are only two compo-\nnents of a large, complex and interconnected protein network that is necessary for \nCME. However, clathrin and AP-2 are key players as the globular ear (appendage) \ndomains found at the C-terminal ends of the α- and β2-adaptin subunits of AP-2 (α-\near and β2-ear) and the globular N-terminal domain (TD) of the clathrin-heavy chain \n(CHC) are major hubs for the organization of the machinery. The components of the \nmachinery work together to nucleate new CCPs, to recruit cargo, to stimulate and \ndrive membrane curvature and eventually to mediate membrane fission and CCV \nuncoating. Much of the work that has led to the identification of the protein compo-\nnents of this machinery has stemmed from biochemical studies in the nervous sys-\ntem. This approach has been particularly fruitful because the proteins that regulate \nSV endocytosis are expressed in brain at much higher levels than are their counter-\nparts that function in housekeeping forms of CME in non-neuronal cells. There are \ncurrently approximately 30 proteins implicated in CME of SVs (Fig. 2). \nThe endocytic machinery must select not only the appropriate proteins for inclusion \nin SVs, but it must select them at the correct molar ratios. It appears that clathrin-\ncoated vesicles (CCVs) are the main organelles responsible for such protein recy-\ncling during endocytosis. A recent proteomic analysis of CCVs isolated from rat \nbrain revealed SV proteins as the major cargo (8). In fact, 87% of the proteins from \nthe CCV proteome assigned to the categories of SV and membrane trafficking were \ndetected in a subsequent proteomic analysis of SVs; in sharp contrast, only 35% of \nthe clathrin trafficking proteins from the CCVs were identified in SVs (8, 153). \nThese data support an important role for CCVs in the recycling of SV components. \nIncluded in the CCV proteome were VAMP-1 and -2, which are v-SNARES and \nsyntaxin 1A/B and synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25), which are \nt-SNAREs. The pairing of these v- and t-SNAREs is crucial for SV exocytosis. The \nrelative levels of the SNARE proteins were determined by quantitative peptide \ncounting (8) revealing that their molar ratios were the same as previously reported \nfor SVs (168). This suggests that CCVs directly recycle SVs without sorting out \nplasma membrane-derived t-SNAREs and other proteins via endosomes, consistent \nwith physiological studies in neurons (49, 114). Thus, CCVs are critical players in \nSV endocytosis. In this chapter, we will provide a detailed description of the endo-\ncytic clathrin machinery of the presynaptic terminal and describe the role of this \nmachinery in SV recycling."}
{"text": "===== Page 9 =====\nThe Molecular Machinery for Synaptic Vesicle Endocytosis\n119\n \n \nAs identification and characterization of the protein components of the synaptic \nendocytic machinery have proceeded, several general lessons regarding CME have \nemerged. One is that the endocytic protein network is highly interconnected. In gen-\neral, the proteins contain one or more of a variety of independently folded protein \nmodules and additional, loosely structured or unstructured regions that may be re-\nferred to as peptide motif domains (Figs. 2 and 3). Examples of protein modules \nfound in endocytic proteins include; PH (pleckstrin homology), PTB (protein tyro-\nsine phosphate binding), SH3 (src homology 3), DNAJ, EH (Eps15 homology), \nE/ANTH (epsin/AP180 N-terminal homology), BAR (Bin1/amphiphysin/Rvs167), \nN-BAR and F-BAR, DENN (differentially expressed in normal versus neoplastic \ncells) and THATCH (talin-HIP1/R-Actin-Tethering C-terminal Homology) domains. \nSeveral of these domains mediate interactions with other proteins in the endocytic \nmachinery through short, consensus peptide motifs found in the peptide motif do-\nmains (Fig. 3). These interactions are generally of low affinity. However, as the \nnetworks form, interconnections between the various components stabilize the over-\nall network in a Velcro-like arrangement. \n \nFig. 3.

Most notable in this \nregard is phosphatidylinositol(4,5)P2 [PtdIns(4,5)P2], a key lipid in CME that is gen-\nerated primarily on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. The interaction of the \nmodules with phospholipids, which are of low affinity, help to anchor the protein \nnetwork to membranes. This arrangement of multiple sites of low affinity contacts is \nideally suited to the biology of CCVs in that the machinery needs to assemble"}

The specific sites of low affinity are readily subject to \nregulation by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins and lipids. \n \nIn addition to the formation of endocytic networks, the protein modules have \nother roles. For example, they bind to cargo and thus function in cargo recruitment to \nnascent CCPs. They interact with components of the cytoskeleton, notably actin \nlinking CME to actin function. They also interact with signaling molecules allowing \nfor the formation of signaling pathways on endocytic vesicles. Finally, the modules \ncan directly modify membranes, critical to the formation of membrane curvature and \nvesicle formation. \n4 Mechanisms of Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis  \nThe rest of this chapter describes the various components of the endocytic machinery \nwith a focus on those involved in CME in presynaptic terminals. We will define what \nis currently known regarding their function and how these components integrate to \nform the overall endocytic machinery. Our discussion will be organized according to \nthe postulated temporal sequence of the events involved in CME. \n4.1 Nucleation of Clathrin-Coated Pits: Roles of Clathrin,  \nAP-2 and AP180 \nThe assembly unit of the clathrin coat is the triskelion, composed of three copies of \nCHC linked through a C-terminal trimerization domain (12) (Fig. 4). Clathrin light \nchains (CLCs) are associated with CHCs but their function is poorly understood. \nCHCs radiate from the trimerization domain with a characteristic curl such that the \nprotein is divided into segments, the proximal leg, the knee, the distal leg and the \nankle, ending in the globular TD (Fig. 4). As triskelia assemble into a clathrin coat or \ncage, the proximal leg segments interdigitate through numerous weak contacts to \nform a lattice of open hexagonal and pentagonal faces with a trimerization domain at \neach vertex (167). The inherent curvature of the CHC and thus, the triskelion means \nthat when assembled, clathrin takes the form of a cage or basket. Electron cryomi-\ncroscopy of purified clathrin cages reveals that in the assembled coat, the C-terminal \nends of the CHCs at the trimerization domain project inward (towards the mem-\nbrane) and make contacts with the ankle regions of three additional triskelia, each \ncentered two vertices away (42). These contacts appear to be invariant and likely \nprovide stability to the lattice. \n \nClathrin triskelia do not bind directly to membranes. Thus, other proteins are \nneeded to recruit clathrin and to mediate its membrane association and in fact nu \nmerous proteins, collectively known as adaptors or clathrin-associated proteins have \nbeen identified that fulfill this role (161). These adaptors bind to both CHCs and \nphospholipids. In the case of SV endocytosis, a key clathrin adaptor is AP180 (Fig. 2), \nwhich was originally identified as a component of CCVs (1) and is enriched in pre-\nsynaptic nerve terminals (179, 184). At its N-terminus, AP180 contains a globular"}
{"text": "===== Page 11 =====\nThe Molecular Machinery for Synaptic Vesicle Endocytosis\n121\n \n \n \nANTH domain that binds to PtdIns(4,5)P2 (40). Through its weakly structured C-\nterminal peptide motif domain (74), AP180 binds to the TD of the CHC (110) and \npurified AP180 is sufficient in vitro to recruit CHC to PtdIns(4,5)P2-enriched lipid \ntubules (40). In addition, AP180 stimulates clathrin assembly and inhibition of the \nassembly activity in squid giant presynaptic nerve terminals disrupts formation of \nCCPs and SV endocytosis (110). Mutation of the AP180 gene of Drosophila (182) \nand C. elegans (119) also results in defects in synaptic vesicle trafficking. Thus, \nAP180 is a critical clathrin adaptor for SV endocytosis. Fig. 4.

Upon fusion of SVs with \nthe plasma membrane synaptotagmin I could coordinate SV endocytosis by recruiting stonin 2 \nand AP-2 through its C2 domains.

{"text": "===== Page 12 =====\n122 \nP.S. McPherson et al. \n \n \nAnother key player in SV endocytosis is AP-2 (Figs. 2 and 4). AP-2 is enriched \nin nerve terminals (13, 178) and consists of a multi-subunit complex composed of \ntwo large subunits, α- and β2-adaptin and two smaller subunits, μ2- and σ2-adaptin \n(136) (Figs. 2 and 4). The large N-terminal regions of α- and β2-adaptin, along with \nthe μ2 and σ2 subunits form the core of the AP-2 complex. The C-terminal regions \nof α and β2 contain the globular ear domains. The ear domains are in fact bi-lobed \nstructures, composed of sandwich and platform subdomains that attach to the core \nvia flexible linkers (122). Given the flexible nature of the linkers, it is thought that \nthe α- and β2-ears project into the cytosol to bind to accessory proteins that function \nat different stages of CCV formation, recruiting them to sites of CME. In addition, \nclathrin triskelia bind through the TD to a consensus motif, the clathrin box, found in \nthe linker region of β2-adaptin and through a region outside the TD to the β2-ear, \nand simultaneous engagement of both sites is required for full binding efficiency (30, \n121, 130, 143, 159) (Fig. 4). Through CHC binding, AP-2 recruits triskelia to mem-\nbranes. In addition, AP-2 stimulates assembly of triskelia into clathrin cages. This \nability to assemble clathrin into cages is enhanced by AP180, which interacts directly \nwith AP-2 in a complex that cooperatively assembles clathrin (51). \n \nThere is some functional evidence that AP-2 participates in SV recycling. In \nDrosophila, SV recycling is impaired in weak AP-2 mutants and is blocked in AP-2-\ndeficient embryos (47). However, it should be pointed out that no loss of function \nexperiments have yet been performed in mammalian neurons. AP-2 knock out mice \ndie very early in development, which prevents reliable assessment of SV endocytosis \n(106). \n4.2 Nucleation of Clathrin-Coated Pits: Recruitment of AP-2 to Synaptic \nVesicle Membranes \nBecause clathrin recruitment requires the joint participation of AP-2 and AP180, the \nmechanisms that allow these adaptors to associate with synaptic membranes are \nfundamental to SV recycling. It appears that PtdIns(4,5)P2 is crucial for the recruit-\nment of AP-2 and AP180 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4). In non-neuronal systems, \ntransient increases in PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels on the surface may be sufficient to initiate \nCCP formation at essentially random sites (31). However, in neurons, SV endocyto-\nsis must be tightly coupled to exocytosis – both in space and in time – in order to \nprevent depletion of SVs and the expansion of the synaptic plasma membrane. Thus, \nfactors in addition to PtdIns(4,5)P2 are needed to initiate CCP formation at specific \nsites on the presynaptic plasma membrane and at a time that follows exocytosis.  \n \nIf SV proteins maintain their integrity within the plasma membrane, then a single \nSV protein could be sufficient to act as “the cargo” for AP-2 attachment, allowing \nthis membrane-associated adaptor to concentrate and assemble clathrin on the SV \nmembrane. Synaptotagmin I, a SV protein that serves as the Ca2+ sensor for exocyto-\nsis, is a strong candidate to play this role. A model for the mechanism by which \nPtdIns(4,5)P2 and synaptotagmin may function co-operatively in nucleation of CCPs \non SV membranes is presented in Fig. 4 and is described below. \n \nGeneration of PtdIns(4,5)P2 mainly involves phosphorylation of another mem-\nbrane lipid, PtdIns(4)P, by the type I PtdIns(4)P kinase (PIP kinase) (Fig. 2). PIP"}
{"text": "===== Page 13 =====\nThe Molecular Machinery for Synaptic Vesicle Endocytosis\n123\n \n \n \nkinase type Iγ is the major PIP kinase in the synapse and knock out of this enzyme \nleads to decreased levels of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and synaptic defects including delayed \nCME and slowing of SV recycling (28). GTP-bound Arf6 recruits PIP kinase type Iγ \nto the synaptic plasma membrane and stimulates its kinase activity leading to the \nformation of CCPs via increased PtdIns(4,5)P2 (83). These results implicate GTP-\nArf6 as an important upstream regulator of CCP nucleation. However, the mecha-\nnisms that localize Arf6 and switch it to the active, GTP-bound form during endocy-\ntosis remain unknown. \n \nGiven the high concentration of AP-2 in the synapse (8, 13), it is likely that this \nadaptor protein is constantly sampling the plasma membrane through kinetic action. \nTransient increases in PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels – through activation of PIP kinase type Iγ \n– would then be detected by AP-2 through the low affinity (5–10 μM) PtdIns(4,5)P2-\nbinding site present in the α-adaptin subunit (62). The μ2-adaptin subunit of AP-2 \nalso contains a PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding site, but this site is conformationally hidden \nunder steady-state conditions. Subsequent to membrane interaction, μ2 undergoes a \nconformational change that exposes the second site; having two PtdIns(4,5)P2-\nbinding sites in a single AP-2 complex greatly stabilizes its association with the \nmembrane (62). Phosphorylation of a key μ2 residue, Thr156, by the AP-2-\nassociated kinase (AAK1) that is associated with brain CCVs (19, 170) (Fig. 2) fa-\nvors the open conformation of AP-2 (62). It is not yet known whether AAK1 activity \nhas any functional role in SV endocytosis. \n \nPtdIns(4,5)P2 provides the mechanism for recruitment of AP-2/clathrin com-\nplexes to membranes. A recent study in yeast provides direct evidence that \nPtdIns(4,5)P2 levels rise in conjunction with clathrin coat assembly and fall during \ndisassembly (151). Moreover, in this system, PtdIns(4,5)P2 is detected in patches on \nthe plasma membrane that correlate precisely with sites of endocytosis (151). How-\never, there is little evidence that PtdIns(4,5)P2 within the presynaptic nerve terminal \nprovides enough spatial information to guide clathrin cages specifically to SV mem-\nbranes within the plasma membrane. Instead, this role may be played by synapto-\ntagmin I. The first indication that synaptotagmin functions as a cargo for endocytic \nadaptors came with the observation that it binds to AP-2 (183), suggesting that syn-\naptotagmin could mark SV membranes within the plasma membrane as the site to \nrecruit clathrin coats. In fact functional studies in C. elegans, Drosophila, squid and \nhippocampal neurons have all demonstrated that synaptotagmin function is crucial \nfor SV endocytosis (44, 72, 118, 126). The major binding site for synaptotagmin I \nwithin the AP-2 complex is the μ2 subunit (54), which is also involved in cargo \nrecognition in non-neuronal cells. In fibroblasts, nascent CCPs will often collapse \nunless they incorporate cargo (31). This may occur because binding to cargo is \nneeded to synergize with PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding to provide sufficient stability to keep \nAP-2 attached to the membrane. Interestingly, cargo binding to AP-2 μ2 has also \nbeen reported to stimulate type I PIPKs, leading to increased production of \nPtdIns(4,5)P2 (84). This could provide a positive feedback mechanism for CCP nu-\ncleation. Thus, synaptotagmin interactions with μ2 may stabilize AP-2 on mem-\nbranes and in particular, at patches of SV membranes. \n \nAlthough synaptotagmin I participates in SV endocytosis, synaptotagmin does \nnot undergo endocytosis when transfected into fibroblasts (69). This suggests that"}
{"text": "===== Page 14 =====\n124 \nP.S. McPherson et al. \n \nneurons possess an endocytic adaptor that functions along with synaptotagmin. \nStonin 1 and 2 may serve this role (Figs. 2 and 4). These proteins are mammalian \nhomologues of the stoned proteins of Drosophila. Stoned proteins are located at the \nsynapse and are essential for the recycling of SVs through direct interactions with \nsynaptotagmin (37, 125). Stonin 2 binds to synaptotagmin I through a μ2-homology \ndomain (29) and also binds to the α-ear of AP-2 through a WXXF-acidic motif (134, \n135, 169), providing an additional bridge between synaptotagmin and clathrin coats. \nThus, two individual synaptotagmin molecules (or a synaptotagmin dimer) could \ninteract simultaneously with stonin 2 and with AP-2, which are bound to each other \n(Fig. 4). These interactions would provide the affinity needed for the formation of a \nstable clathrin coat on synaptotagmin-containing SV membranes. Consistent with \nthis model, stonin 2/AP-2 endocytic complexes interact with synaptotagmin on the \npresynaptic plasma membrane face but not on intracellular SVs (77). However, it is \nnot yet clear how the properties of synaptotagmin change when this protein resides \non the plasma membrane. It also is not clear how these changes selectively allow \nrecruitment of the endocytic coat. These and many related issues require further \nstudy. \n4.3 Nucleation of Clathrin-Coated Pits: NECAPs at Work with AP-2 \nA proteomic analysis of highly enriched CCVs from brain revealed eight novel pro-\nteins (8, 170), seven of which have been subsequently linked to clathrin-mediated \ntrafficking (19, 20, 132, 134, 170, our unpublished data). Two of these proteins were \noriginally recognized as homologs but that apparently shared no homology or com-\nmon domains with any previously characterized proteins. The proteins, which were \nnamed NECAP (adaptin ear binding coat associated protein) 1 and 2, are highly \nenriched on the coats of CCVs (134). NECAP 2 is ubiquitously distributed, while \nNECAP 1 is expressed predominantly in brain. Both NECAP proteins bind to the α-\near of AP-2 via their C-terminal regions (134) (Figs. 2 and 3). Within brain, NECAP \n1 is present in the presynaptic compartment and overexpression of constructs that \ninterfere with the interaction of NECAP 1 with AP-2 blocks CME of SVs (113). \nThus, NECAP 1 may be a new component of the SV endocytic machinery. \n \nThe identification of the α-ear as a site for NECAP binding (134) was surprising: \neven though the α-ear is a key hub for organization of the endocytic machinery, \nNECAPs do not contain DPF/W or FXDXF motifs, which until recently were the \nonly motifs known to bind to the α-ear (10, 120, 160). Through deletion analysis, the \nC-terminal sequence WVQF-COO– of the NECAPs was identified as a novel AP-2 \nα-ear-binding motif (134). Interestingly, unlike DPF/W and FXDXF motifs, which \nbind to the platform subdomain of the α-ear, structural studies demonstrated that \nWVQF-COO– binds to the sandwich subdomain (135). Subsequent database searches \nhave identified a number of endocytic proteins that contain WVQF-like motifs, in-\ncluding a splice variant of synaptojanin and stonin 2, and the motifs within these \nproteins do indeed confer AP-2 binding (70, 169). Sequence alignment reveals a \nconsensus motif of WXXF-acidic (where the acidic is provided by the free carboxy \nterminus or by one or more internal aspartic acid or glutamic acid residues) (135)."}
{"text": "===== Page 15 =====\nThe Molecular Machinery for Synaptic Vesicle Endocytosis\n125\n \n \n \nThese results thus reveal a greater potential for the α-ear to function as a recruitment \nscaffold during CME. \n \nThe exact function of NECAP 1 in SV endocytosis is unknown. However, a \nrecent structural study has revealed that the conserved N-terminal region of the pro-\ntein forms a PH-like domain called the PHear domain (137) (Fig. 2). Remarkably, \nthis domain binds to FXDXF motifs, which as described previously are binding \nmotifs for the platform subdomain of the α-ear. In fact, the PHear domain function-\nally mimics the platform subdomain of the α-ear, hence the name (PH fold with ear-\nlike function) (137). Thus, when NECAP is bound to the sandwich subdomain \nthrough the C-terminal WXXF-acidic motif, its N-terminal PHear domain would be \npositioned near the platform subdomain. Given that the α-ear is attached to the AP-2 \ncore via a flexible linker region, the linker apparently acts as a “fishing line” with the \nα-ear serving as the “hook” needed to snare accessory proteins from the cytosol. \nWith NECAP in place, this hook would have two barbs for interacting with FXDXF \nmotif-bearing proteins. Because FXDXF interactions with the α-ear platform domain \nare of low affinity, in the 50 μM range, the combination of two domains should \nincrease FXDXF protein binding. In summary, NECAPs appear to function coopera-\ntively with AP-2 in the formation of CCPs. \n4.4 Membrane Curvature: Eps15 and Epsin, EH and ENTH Domains \nAP-2 and AP180 are responsible for recruiting clathrin triskelia to the synaptic \nplasma membrane and for stimulating their assembly into a lattice. The inherent \ncurvature of triskelia leads to a curved lattice and eventually a spherical cage as the \ntriskelia are assembled. In fact, assembly of purified triskelia in vitro leads to a \nclathrin cage with a diameter similar to that of a CCV in vivo. Thus, it was long \nthought that assembly of clathrin was sufficient to drive membrane budding and \ncurvature in cells and some evidence in support of this idea has been reported by \nHinrichsen et al. (60). However, it is now thought that, under normal physiological \nconditions, clathrin assembly is not the major mechanism to drive membrane bud-\nding. Instead, it appears that various components of the clathrin machinery act di-\nrectly on lipid bilayers to stimulate and maintain curvature (98). A common theme is \nthat the endocytic proteins stimulate curvature by insertion of amphipathic helices \ninto membranes. Inserting such helices into the cytosolic leaflet of a membrane dis-\nplaces lipid headgroups and thereby creates an asymmetry between the bilayer leaf-\nlets. Such leaflet asymmetry causes spontaneous membrane curvature toward the \ncytosolic side as predicted by the bilayer couple hypothesis (146).  \n \nThe first example of such a mechanism for producing membrane curvature was \nprovided by studies on the ENTH domain of the endocytic protein epsin (Fig. 2). \nEpsin (Eps15-interacting protein) was originally identified because of its ability to \nbind to the EH domains of Eps15 (16). Eps15 (EGFR pathway substrate clone no. \n15) itself (Fig. 2) had been previously identified as a substrate for the EGFR kinase \n(36). Subsequent studies demonstrated that Eps15 binds to the α-ear of AP-2 (and \nthe NECAP PHear domain via 15 DPF and 1 FXDXF motifs) and is a component of \nCCPs and CCVs, implicating Eps15 in CME (5, 6, 137, 158). At its N-terminus, \nEps15 contains three copies of the EH domain (Fig. 2), which is found in other endo-"}
{"text": "===== Page 16 =====\n126 \nP.S. McPherson et al. \n \ncytic proteins including intersectin (109, 175). EH domains interact with a NPF \ntripeptide (Fig. 3) and epsin contains three copies of this motif (16). Both epsin and \nEps15 are enriched in presynaptic terminals (16, 180). Disruption of interactions \nbetween EH domain proteins and their substrates in squid giant presynaptic nerve \nterminals inhibit the formation of CCPs and CCVs during SV endocytosis (112). \nMoreover, genetic studies have demonstrated that both the C. elegans and Droso-\nphila homologues of Eps15 have crucial roles in SV recycling (92, 142). Together, \nthese studies demonstrate the importance of EH domain/NPF-mediated networks for \nSV recycling (109). \n \nIn addition to the NPF motifs that interact with Eps15 and intersectin, the weakly \nstructured C-terminal peptide motif domain of epsin (74) also contains eight copies \nof the DPW tripeptide that mediates binding to the α-ear of AP-2 (120, 160) and two \ndistinct clathrin box motifs for binding the CHC TD (63, 140) (Figs. 2 and 3). At its \nN-terminus, epsin contains an ENTH domain, an approximately 150-residue region \n(76, 140) that has a globular structure composed of eight α-helices (40, 65, 67). A \nbreakthrough in the understanding of epsin function and the role of endocytic regula-\ntory proteins in membrane curvature came with the observation that the ENTH do-\nmain binds to PtdIns(4,5)P2 through basic residues in helices 1, 3 and 4 and the loop \nbetween helix 1 and 2 (40, 67). More fundamentally, Ford et al. (41) demonstrated \nthat binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2 causes unstructured residues at the N-terminus of the \nENTH domain to form a new α-helix with a series of hydrophobic residues on its \nouter surface. This new helix inserts into PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing monolayers and \nthis can be directly measured by assessing changes in membrane surface pressure \n(149). Interestingly, mutation of specific hydrophobic residues within the helix that \nprevented membrane insertion blocked the development of membrane curvature \n(41). Thus, epsin appears to serve a key role in the initial development of membrane \ncurvature that is critical for the formation of CCPs and CCVs during SV recycling. \n \nInterestingly, mutations in epsin that disrupt the ability of the ENTH domain to \nstimulate curvature block the progression of curvature even under conditions where \nclathrin has been recruited to membranes and has assembled into a lattice (41). This \nprovided a key piece of evidence that clathrin assembly on its own is unlikely to be \nsufficient for the generation of curvature. Instead, clathrin may simply form a scaf-\nfold upon which the curvature machinery (ENTH domain and BAR domain proteins, \nsee below) is organized. Additionally, the clathrin lattice may contribute to curvature \nby the formation of a mold into which the deformed membrane can be structured into \na highly curved vesicle. Regardless of the precise mechanism, it has become appar-\nent that generating a highly curved SV from an essentially flat synaptic plasma \nmembrane is complex and likely involves a series of proteins working in concert.  \n4.5 Membrane Curvature: Endophilin and Amphiphysin, N-BAR  \nand BAR Domains \nEndophilin was originally identified in biochemical and yeast two-hybrid screens as \na binding partner for the endocytic enzyme synaptojanin (25, 133). Endophilin is \ncomposed of an N-terminal BAR domain, a central domain and a C-terminal SH3 \ndomain (Fig. 2). The SH3 domain mediates interactions with proline-rich sequences"}
{"text": "===== Page 17 =====\nThe Molecular Machinery for Synaptic Vesicle Endocytosis\n127\n \n \n \nin the peptide motif domains of synaptojanin and dynamin (104, 133) (Fig. 3) and it \nis the ability to bind to these key endocytic regulatory enzymes that gave endophilin \nits name (104). Disruption of these interactions through injection of peptides and \nantibodies into the lamprey reticulospinal synapse impairs SV endocytosis, demon-\nstrating a role for endophilin in SV recycling (45). Subsequent studies in Drosophila \nand C. elegans have revealed that endophilin mutants and synaptojanin mutants have \nnearly identical phenotypes: both have accumulations of CCVs in the synapse and an \nabnormal, clustered distribution of SVs away from the active zone (144, 164). More-\nover, defects observed in synaptojanin and endophilin double mutants closely resem-\nble those seen in either single mutant, demonstrating that the two proteins function \non the same pathway (144, 164) as predicted from earlier biochemical studies (25, \n133). Finally, synaptojanin was lost from the nerve terminals of endophilin mutants \n(144, 164), thus indicating that endophilin serves to recruit synaptojanin to nerve \nterminals during SV endocytosis. There also are indications that endophilin may play \nadditional roles during endocytosis (26, 165) \n \nAmphiphysin 1 and 2 are two proteins that have domain structures similar to that \nof endophilin. These proteins have an N-terminal BAR domain, a variable central \ndomain and a C-terminal SH3 domain (Fig. 2). As is the case for endophilin, the SH3 \ndomains of the amphiphysins bind to synaptojanin and dynamin (23, 99, 129). Am-\nphiphysin 1 is expressed predominantly in brain, while amphiphysin 2, which is \nexpressed as alternatively spliced isoforms, is more widely distributed (14, 23, 24, \n129, 130). The predominant neuronal isoform of amphiphysin 2 forms heterodimers \nwith amphiphysin 1 and this amphiphysin heterodimer is concentrated in presynaptic \nnerve terminals (129, 173). Both components of this heterodimer interact, via their \ncentral domain, with clathrin, NECAP and AP-2 (97, 129, 130, 137). Thus, amphi-\nphysins are well positioned to function in the recruitment of synaptojanin and dy-\nnamin to sites of CCV formation during SV endocytosis. In fact, presynaptic micro-\ninjection of peptides that compete with the binding partners of the SH3 domains of \nthe amphiphysins impairs SV endocytosis (148). Moreover, knock out of the amphi-\nphysin 1 gene of mice leads to a concomitant loss of amphiphysin 2 and defects in \nSV recycling (27). Thus, the amphiphysins are key players in SV endocytosis. \n \nMost recently, much of the focus on endophilin and amphiphysin has been on the \nBAR domain. The function of BAR domains was first suggested from the observa-\ntion that the N-terminus of amphiphysin I, which mediates dimerization (131, 173) \ncould bind to liposomes and cause them to form tubules (155). It was subsequently \ndemonstrated that the N-terminus of endophilin, which is weakly homologous to the \nN-terminus of amphiphysin, also binds to membranes and converts lipid bilayers into \nnarrow tubules (35). Structural studies of the BAR domain from arfaptin (157) and \namphiphysin (124) revealed a dimer, with each monomer composed of three kinked \nα-helices that together form a six helix bundle. The BAR domain dimer has an elon-\ngated crescent structure, with positive charge along a concave surface that permits \nelectrostatic interactions with negatively charged membranes (124). More recently, \nseveral groups have solved the structure of the BAR domain of endophilin (46, 96, \n171). The structure is very similar to that of amphiphysin, except for the presence of \nan N-terminal amphipathic helix and two largely disordered domains that are in-\nserted into helix 1, projecting from the concave face of the dimer. When the BAR"}
{"text": "===== Page 18 =====\n128 \nP.S. McPherson et al. \n \ndomain engages the membrane, the N-terminal helix folds and is peripherally bound \nin the plane of the membrane, ideally situated to affect membrane curvature (46, 96). \nThe combination of the N-terminal helix with the BAR domain has led to the desig-\nnation of the N-BAR domain. \n \nThus, BAR domains are thought to have two distinct but overlapping functions. \nFirst, they can act as molecular switches. Different BAR domains can have different \ndegrees of curvature on their concave faces and will thus best interact with mem-\nbranes of a defined degree of curvature (98). They could thus serve to recruit pro-\nteins to newly formed vesicles only after a certain degree of curvature has been \nreached. For example, the amphiphysin BAR domain would best recognize a bilayer \nwith curvature similar to the neck of a deeply invaginated CCP and could thus recruit \ndynamin specifically to this site. A second function for BAR domains, and in par-\nticular for N-BAR domains, is to contribute to the induction of curvature by forcing \nmembranes to conform to the concave face of the module (98). In addition, insertion \nof the N-terminal helix of an N-BAR domain into the cytosolic leaflet stimulates \ncurvature as descried for ENTH domains. In summary, amphiphysins and endophilin \nboth recruit endocytic proteins, such as dynamin and synaptojanin, and contribute to \ncurving of membranes during CCV formation. \n4.6 Transition to Fission: F-BAR Domains Link Curvature to Fission \nVia Actin \nThe FCH (Fes/CIP4 homology) domain is a protein module found in a wide variety \nof proteins. Many of these proteins have been linked to regulation of the actin cy-\ntoskeleton while others have been implicated in CME, due to their SH3 domain-\ndependent binding to dynamin (68, 162). For example, the syndapin/PACSIN family \nof proteins (Fig. 2) functions in CME via interactions with dynamin and synaptojanin \nand also contributes to regulation of actin via binding to N-WASP (108, 127). Recent \nexamination of sequences downstream of the FCH domain revealed a coiled-coil \ndomain that, when considered as part of the FCH domain, is homologous to BAR \ndomains. The extended module was thus renamed the extended FCH (EFC) or F-\nBAR domain (68, 162). Like BAR domains, the F-BAR domain tubulates lipid \nmembranes both in liposomes and in cells. However, the tubules formed by F-BAR \ndomains are larger in diameter than those produced by N-BAR domains (68, 162). \nMost recently, two groups have solved the crystal structure of the F-BAR domain \n(55, 147). The structures reveal a gently curving helical-bundle dimer with a distant \nrelationship to BAR domains. The curved domain best fits a tubular membrane with \na diameter of approximately 60 nm and generates tubules as large as 130 nm in di-\nameter (55, 147). The module forms filaments through end-to-end interactions, lead-\ning to striations on tubular membranes after addition of the F-BAR domain (147). \nThus, F-BAR domains may sense initial states of curvature of CCPs and then assem-\nble into filaments around the invaginated membrane to drive further CCP invagina-\ntion (147). \n \nIt thus appears that the membrane curvature needed for CCV formation is gener-\nated through the coordinated action of several lipid-binding protein modules. Ini-\ntially, ENTH domains and N-BAR domains insert amphipathic helicies into mem-"}
{"text": "===== Page 19 =====\nThe Molecular Machinery for Synaptic Vesicle Endocytosis\n129\n \n \n \nbranes to create bilayer asymmetry and initiate curvature. This low degree of curva-\nture of the membrane would then be sensed by F-BAR domain proteins, which \nwould form filaments to further induce invagination. Once the membrane reaches a \ndeeply invaginated state, BAR domain proteins would recognize the highly curved, \nsmall diameter membrane at the neck of the vesicle and recruit dynamin to drive \nmembrane fission. In addition, many F-BAR domain proteins interact with regula-\ntory proteins of the actin cytoskeleton, most notably N-WASP. Thus, as these pro-\nteins drive later stages of curvature they could also recruit N-WASP to endocytic \nsites. N-WASP stimulates actin assembly, which has been proposed to apply tension \non the invaginated membrane for the function of dynamin (141). Through formation \nof such protein networks, which initiate, stabilize and resolve membrane curvature-\ndependent processes, early events and late events in the formation of CCPs and \nCCVs could be linked. \n4.7 Transition to Fission: HIPs and Intersectin-l Provide Additional \nLinks to Actin \nAnother link between the clathrin machinery and the actin cyoskeleton is provided \nby the huntingtin-interacting proteins (HIPs) (Fig. 2). HIP1 was initially identified in \na yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with huntingtin, the protein prod-\nuct of the Huntington's disease gene (73). Another HIP1-related protein \n(HIP1R/HIP12) was identified by its sequence similarity to HIP1, although HIP1R \ndoes not bind directly to huntingtin (18). HIP1 and HIP1R have similar domain \nstructures, with an N-terminal ANTH domain for phospholipid interaction (66), a \nhelical domain that mediates dimerization and binding to CLCs, and a C-terminal \nTHATCH domain (7, 11, 33, 56, 87) (Fig. 2). The interaction of HIPs with CLCs \ntargets these proteins to clathrin-coated structures (17, 88), causing HIP1 and HIP1R \nto be major components of the coats of CCPs and CCVs (32, 33, 102, 105, 166). \n \nThe C-terminal THATCH domain allows HIP1R (but not HIP1) to bind to actin \n(11, 33, 87). Moreover, a proline-rich sequence of HIP1R binds to the SH3 domain \nof cortactin (85). While cortactin stimulates actin assembly via activation of N-\nWASP, interaction of cortactin with HIP1R inhibits actin assembly (85). Thus, \nknock down of HIP1R with small inhibitory RNA leads to over-assembly of actin \nand defects in CME (34, 85). HIP1R therefore appears to be necessary for the appro-\npriate interaction of clathrin-coated structures with the actin cytoskeleton. Under \nnormal physiological circumstances, HIP1R, perhaps in heterodimers with HIP1, \ncould link actin to clathrin coats on deeply invaginated CCPs, providing the invagi-\nnating endocytic structure with the tension that is needed for dynamin to drive mem-\nbrane fission (141).  \n \nAnother actin regulatory protein that is also involved in CME is intersectin-\nlong (intersectin-l). Intersectin-l, a splice variant of intersectin-s, has a C-terminal \nextension with a Dbl homology (DH), pleckstrin homology (PH) and C2 domain \n(63) (Fig. 2). The combination of DH and PH domains is characteristic of guanine-\nnucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and allows intersectin-l to act as a Cdc42-\nspecific GEF (64, 75, 181). The GEF activity of intersectin-l is stimulated by N-\nWASP binding to intersectin-l. This increases the amount of GTP-bound Cdc42,"}
{"text": "===== Page 20 =====\n130 \nP.S. McPherson et al. \n \nwhich in turn activates N-WASP and stimulates actin assembly (64). In addition, \nintersectin-l binds to dynamin (176). Thus, intersectin-l is ideally situated to stimu-\nlate actin assembly in proximity to CCPs and CCVs, particularly in the presence of \ndynamin, although whether or not intersectin-1 functions in CME of SVs has never \nbeen tested.  \n4.8 Fission of CCVs: Dynamin Drives Membrane Fission \nDynamin was one of the first endocytic accessory proteins to be identified and re-\nmains a central feature of all current models of endocytosis. Dynamin contains an N-\nterminal GTPase domain, a GED (GTPase effector domain), which acts as an in-\ntramolecular GTPase activating protein (GAP) (145), and a proline-rich domain that \nbinds various SH3 domain-bearing proteins (48) (Fig. 2). A role for dynamin in \nCME was originally suggested by its identification as the product of the Drosophila \nshibire gene (163). Temperature-sensitive Shibire mutants display rapid paralysis at \nthe restrictive temperature, due to impairment of SV recycling and subsequent block \nof synaptic transmission (80). This block of SV recycling at the non-permissive \ntemperature is due to inhibition of membrane fission during endocytosis, evident as the \nappearance of endocytic vesicles that remain attached to the plasma membrane by \nnarrow membrane stalks (82). Dynamin was subsequently demonstrated to oligomerize \ninto rings with an inner diameter similar to that of the membrane stalks seen in shibire \nflies (61). Treatment of synaptosomes with GTPγS, which locks dynamin into a GTP-\nbound state and inhibits SV endocytosis (57, 177), leads to production of CCVs that \nremained attached to the plasma membrane via extended membrane necks (154). The \nnecks are coated with dynamin spirals, leading to the hypothesis that dynamin func-\ntions in vesicle fission as a mechanochemical enzyme that utilizes GTP hydrolysis to \nprovide a twisting force that severs the membrane tube (154). \n \nVarious models have been proposed to explain how dynamin functions in vesicle \nfission. In the GTP-bound form, dynamin appears as tightly packed rings on lipid \nnanotubes, with GTP hydrolysis increasing the space between the rings. This sug-\ngests that a spring-like expansion (conformational change) drives vesicle fission \n(150). The main alternative model is that dynamin does not function as a mechano-\nchemical enzyme but – by analogy to other GTPases – functions in the recruitment \nof other factors required for fission (145). This model arose from the study of dy-\nnamin with mutations in the GED domain that inhibited the intramolecular GAP \nactivity and thus held dynamin in the active, GTP-bound state. These mutants in fact \nstimulated CME, suggesting that GTP-bound dynamin recruits other (unidentified) \nproteins that produce fission (145). Thus, the exact mechanism of dynamin function \nhas remained elusive.  \n \nA recent paper has provided support for the role of dynamin as a mechanochemi-\ncal enzyme that drives fission (141). Specifically, the addition of GTP to dynamin-\ncoated lipid tubules resulted in twisting of the tubules: this twisting motion was ob-\nserved by using streptavidin beads conjugated to biotinylated dynamin, in which the \nbeads were seen to swing around the tubules. Moreover, when lipid tubules were \ngenerated by the motor activity of kinesin on microtubules, and were thus subjected \nto longtitudinal tension, dynamin/GTP could drive fission, while no fission was"}
{"text": "===== Page 21 =====\nThe Molecular Machinery for Synaptic Vesicle Endocytosis\n131\n \n \n \nobserved in the absence of tension (141). Thus, the twisting force of dynamin ap-\npears to lead to constriction that causes fission on membranes under tension. In cells, \nit is likely that tension on the deeply invaginated CCPs is provided by the assembly \nof actin. \n \nWork with the shibire mutant of Drosophila leaves no doubt that dynamin plays \na crucial role in SV endocytosis. The function of dynamin in SV endocytosis in \nmammalian presynaptic terminals was recently clarified through the use of dynamin \n1 knock out mice (38). Mammals express three dynamin genes: dynamin 1, which is \nbrain specific and is the most abundant form, dynamin 2 that is expressed ubiqui-\ntously, and dynamin 3, which is expressed in brain and testis (15). In dynamin 1 null \nanimals, SV endocytosis is highly compromised during strong exogenous stimula-\ntion. Somewhat surprisingly however, SV endocytosis is normal after strong stimula-\ntion stops (38). Expressing any of the three dynamin isoforms in knock-out neurons \ncould compensate for the dynamin 1 phenotype, though dynamin 3 was more effec-\ntive than dynamin 2. Thus, whereas dynamin 1 functions during high levels of neu-\nronal activity, other mechanisms drive membrane fission during low levels of activ-\nity, with dynamin 3 being the most likely candidate for the fission that does not \ndepend upon dynamin 1. \n \nThe proline-rich peptide motif domain of dynamin 1 has multiple sites for SH3 \ndomain binding (Fig. 2), with endophilin, amphiphysin and syndapin/PACSIN \nbeing the three key interacting proteins. Each of these proteins contains an N-\nterminal domain that can sense membrane curvature: endophilin (N-BAR domain), \namphiphysin (BAR domain) and syndapin (F-BAR domain). Interestingly, the \ndegree of curvature that is best suited for each domain is unique (55, 124, 147). \nThus, it is possible that these proteins contribute to the recruitment of dynamin 1 to \nthe membrane at different stages of CCV formation. Although it is clear that dy-\nnamin functions late in CME, this protein also appears to function at earlier steps \n(91). For example, the F-BAR domain appears to best fit membrane curvatures \nconsistent with a shallow CCP whereas the amphiphysin BAR domain recognizes \nhighly curved membranes such as those at the neck of a deeply invaginated CCP \n(55, 124, 147).  \n \nInterestingly, the ability of dynamin 1 to interact with its SH3 domain partners is \nregulated by phosphorylation. In fact, dynamin 1 is one of a group of at least eight \ndephosphins, proteins that undergo a coordinated dephosphorylation reaction in \nnerve terminals during SV endocytosis (21). It is thought that the dephosphorylation \npromotes the assembly of protein complexes needed for SV endocytosis. The subse-\nquent rephosphorylation of the proteins is necessary for maintaining the continuity of \nSV recycling (21). To date, only one dephosphin kinase has been identified, cyclin-\ndependent protein kinase 5 (Cdk5); disruption of its activity blocks CME of SVs \n(156). Careful analysis of the phosphorylation of dynamin 1 by Cdk5 has revealed \nthat the major phosphorylation-regulated dynamin 1 partner is syndapin (3). Thus, \nalthough the functional role of the dynamin 1/syndapin interaction is unknown, it \nappears clear that these proteins form a highly regulated partnership that is critical \nfor SV endocytosis and recycling."}

McPherson et al. \n \n4.9 Uncoating CCVs: Synaptojanin and Stability of Coats \nOnce CCVs have been liberated from the membrane by dynamin-dependent fission, \nthey must rapidly uncoat before they can be reloaded with neurotransmitter and re-\nenter the recycling pool of SVs. At least two types of proteins have been implicated \nin this process, synaptojanin and the uncoating ATPase Hsc70. \n \nSynaptojanin was originally identified as a 145 kDa protein that bound to SH3 \ndomains, was expressed predominantly in brain, and was enriched on endocytic \nintermediates of the synapse (99, 100). Subsequent cloning of the protein, which was \nlater renamed synaptojanin 1-145, revealed a N-terminal Sac1 homology domain \nfollowed by a central inositol 5-phosphatase domain and a proline-rich C-terminus \n(101) (Fig. 2). The Sac1 domain dephosphorylates PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(4)P and the \n5-phosphatase domain dephosphorylates PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 at the 5′ \nposition (50, 101). The identification of synaptojanin 1-145 was in fact instrumental \nin the early development of the idea that PtdIns(4,5)P2 functions in SV endocytosis. \nThe C-terminal peptide motif domain of synaptojanin 1-145 is primarily a protein \ninteraction domain that binds to a variety of SH3 domain-containing proteins that are \nthought to be involved in targeting the protein to sites of CME. Through an alterna-\ntive splice in the C-terminus, a second, longer synaptojanin 1 isoform, synaptojanin \n1-170, is generated. This isoform is expressed in brain but has a much broader tissue \ndistribution than synaptojanin 1-145 (128). Synaptojanin 1-170 contains additional \npeptide motifs for binding to clathrin, AP-2 and EH domains (Figs. 2 and 3). Inter-\nestingly, multicolor TIRF (total internal reflection fluorescence) microscopy has \nrecently revealed that synaptojanin 1-145 is recruited to membranes as a burst at a \nlate stage of CCP formation, whereas synaptojanin 1-170 is present at CCPs \nthroughout their formation (123). Thus, dynamic phosphoinositide metabolism is \nlikely to be important at all stages of CCP/CCV formation. \n \nIn neurons, synaptojanin 1 knock-out mice have increased overall levels of \nPtdIns(4,5)P2 and an accumulation of uncoated CCVs in their presynaptic terminals \n(22). Moreover, mutations in unc-26, the C. elegans homologue of synaptojanin, also \nlead to defects in the budding of SVs from the plasma membrane and in the uncoat-\ning of CCVs (53). Thus, synaptojanin-dependent dephosphorylation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 \nis likely important as a trigger to destabilize clathrin coats following SV endocytosis, \nallowing the coat to come off and the SV to re-enter the release pool. In yeast, \npatches of PtdIns(4,5)P2 that form on the plasma membrane are rapidly lost co-\nincident with the arrival of synaptojanin and disassembly of the clathrin coat (151). \nIndeed, synaptojanin knock-out mice show a delay in the reentry of recycling vesi-\ncles into the fusion-competent pool although SV recycling is not abolished (78). A \nsecond gene product, synaptojanin 2, has also been identified and at least one synap-\ntojanin 2 splice variant is expressed in nerve terminals (116). The function of synap-\ntojanin 2 in SV endocytosis has not been directly assessed but it is possible that it is \nfunctionally redundant with synaptojanin 1 and accounts for the residual SV endocy-\ntosis seen in synaptojanin 1 null animals."}
{"text": "===== Page 23 =====\nThe Molecular Machinery for Synaptic Vesicle Endocytosis\n133\n \n \n \n4.10 Uncoating CCVs: Auxilin and Hsc70 \nWhile dephosphorylation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 contributes to destabilization of the coat of \nCCVs, it is not sufficient to disassemble the clathrin lattice. In vitro, the assembly of \nclathrin triskelia into clathrin cages can proceed spontaneously, indicating that an \nenergy-dependent step is necessary to dissociate the clathrin cage. The energy re-\nquired for disassembly of clathrin cages appears to come from an ATPase, the heat \nshock cognate 70 (Hsc70) protein. Hsc70 is a critical factor in CCV uncoating in \nvitro, with the hydrolysis of three ATP molecules necessary for the release of one \ntriskelia (9, 79) and dominant-negative forms of Hsc70 disrupt clathrin uncoating \nand multiple stages of clathrin-mediated trafficking in cells (117). Essential co-\nfactors for Hsc70 are the auxilins. Auxilin 1, which is brain specific, contains an N-\nterminal region with sequence similarity to the phosphatase and C2 domains of \nPTEN (a PtdIns(3)-phosphatase), a central region containing motifs that bind to \nclathrin and AP-2, and a DNAJ domain at the C-terminus (Fig. 2). Auxilin 2, which \nis also known as cyclin G-associated kinase or GAK, has a ubiquitous tissue distribu-\ntion and a similar domain structure as auxilin 1 but with an additional N-terminal \nser/thr kinase domain (79). Auxilins bind directly to clathrin and AP-2 and through \nthe DNAJ domain they bind Hsc70 in the ATP-bound form. Injection into presynap-\ntic nerve terminals of auxilin 1 with a mutation in the conserved HPD motif of the \nDNAJ domain, which prevents auxilin 1 interaction with Hsc70, disrupts CCV un-\ncoating and synaptic transmission (111). Thus, a key function for auxilin is to recruit \nHsc70 to newly formed CCVs for uncoating and SV recycling. \n \nBecause auxilins should be able to bind to partially assembled lattices, it is im-\nportant to understand what prevents Hsc70 from uncoating CCVs prematurely. One \npotential mechanism is that auxilin may be recruited to CCVs only late in their life \ncycle. Alternatively, Hsc70 could be recruited at any time but with the ATPase activ-\nity regulated to only activate uncoating at specific times. Two recent studies have \nexamined the recruitment of auxilin over the life cycle of CCVs in non-neuronal \nsystems (86, 95). Auxilin was found to be present at sites of CCV formation at early \npoints, however, there is a major burst of auxilin recruitment following the peak of \ndynamin recruitment late in the CCV life cycle. Interestingly, the late recruitment of \nauxilin depends upon the PTEN-like domain. This domain binds specifically to \ninostiol phospholipids, most notably to PtdIns(3)P (86, 95). This result suggests that \na switch in the levels of specific inositol phospholipid levels late in CCV formation \nmay act as a trigger to recruit auxilin/Hsc70 for CCV uncoating. This is perhaps not \nsurprising given the key role of inositol phospholipids in the nucleation of CCPs and \nthe observation that knock out of synaptojanin leads to an accumulation of CCVs in \nnerve terminals (22). \n \nHsc70 has recently been identified as a binding partner of CHL1, a cell adhesion \nmolecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily (89). Ablation of the CHL1 gene re-\nduced the levels of Hsc70 in the presynaptic compartment and CHL1 deficiency or \ndisruption of CHL1/Hsc70 interactions led to the accumulation of CCVs at synapses \n(89). Thus, CHL1 appears to function as a synapse-targeting factor for Hsc70. How-\never, CHL1 was also found to undergo CME in an activity dependent manner and to \ninteract with Hsc70 on CCVs in the synapse. Thus, CHL1 may represent an addi-"}

McPherson et al. \n \ntional mechanism to recruit Hsc70 for CCV uncoating during SV recycling, which \nmay be needed to meet the high demands placed on this specialized form of CME. \n4.11 Post-Uncoating: Connecdenn and DENN Domains, a Late Function \nin Endocytosis? \nIdentification of the consensus WXXF-acidic α-ear-binding motif in the NECAP \nproteins led to a bioinformatics analysis that revealed a novel protein containing the \nC-terminal sequence WETFE-COO– (2). At its N-terminus, the protein contains a \nmodule referred to as the DENN (differentially expressed in normal versus neoplas-\ntic cells) domain, leading to the name connecdenn for this protein (2) (Fig. 2). Con-\nnecdenn is highly enriched on CCVs and, as expected, binds to the α-ear of AP-2. \nThe protein is expressed predominantly in brain where it is enriched in presynaptic \nnerve terminals (2). In addition to the WXXF-acidic motif, connecdenn also contains \nsingle DPF and FXDXF motifs; all three of these motifs contribute to α-ear binding, \nalthough the WXXF-acidic motif is the strongest of the three. Disruption of the in-\nteraction of connecdenn with AP-2, through overexpression of C-terminal con-\nnecdenn fragments, blocks SV endocytosis in hippocampal neurons, as does con-\nnecdenn knock down using lentiviral delivery of connecdenn-specific shRNA (2). \nThese experiments suggest that connecdenn is a component of the machinery for SV \nendocytosis.  \n \nDENN domains are composed of upstream (u)DENN and downstream (d)DENN \nmodules flanking a DENN module, forming a unit that is readily detected using the \nconserved domain search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (93). \nThe domain is well conserved throughout evolution and is found in multiple proteins \nfrom diverse species including humans, C. elegans and S. pombe. Prominent DENN \ndomain-containing proteins include myotubular myopathy related (MTMR) 5 and \n13, which are homologues of the myotubularin lipid phosphatases that function at \nendosomes (138) and DENN/MADD, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for the \nSV protein Rab3 (107). However, the majority of DENN domain-containing proteins \nare uncharacterized and there is essentially no information regarding DENN domain \nstructure or the biological context of DENN domain function (90). Connecdenn is \nthus important because it links DENN domain proteins to the process of SV endocy-\ntosis and introduces a new module into the endocytic machinery (Fig. 3). \n \nConnecdenn has a unique association with CCVs in that it remains associated \nwith the vesicles following CCV uncoating (2). In fact, the protein is tightly associ-\nated with the membranes and resists extraction even in the presence of high salt (2). \nPreliminary evidence demonstrates that the C-terminus of connecdenn guides the \nprotein to CCVs but the DENN domain is responsible for the stable membrane asso-\nciation. It is likely that the stable association of connecdenn with CCV membranes \nensures a post-uncoating function for the protein, likely in endosomal trafficking or \nmorphology. Interestingly, knock-out of DENN/MADD leads to mice that have \nreduced numbers of SVs, suggesting a possible defect in SV reformation (107). \nThus, DENN domain proteins may be involved generally in endocytic membrane \ntrafficking and SV endocytosis/reformation."}
{"text": "===== Page 25 =====\nThe Molecular Machinery for Synaptic Vesicle Endocytosis\n135\n \n \n \n5 Conclusions \nAlthough it has been known for more than 30 years that endocytosis via CCVs is \nrequired for SV recycling, for most of these years our understanding of the molecular \nmechanisms involved in SV endocytosis has lagged far behind our appreciation of \nthe molecular mechanisms of SV exocytosis. Fortunately, a surge in studies of CCVs \nand their molecular constituents has led to tremendous recent advances in our appre-\nciation of the molecular underpinnings of SV endocytosis. One tangible result is that \nnearly 30 proteins now have been implicated in SV endocytosis (Fig. 2), though \nmore endocytic proteins undoubtedly await discovery. \n \nTo date, the main conclusion is that the sequence of events that leads to removal \nof SV components from the plasma membrane and the recycling of SVs requires a \ncomplex web of interactions between proteins and lipids. This web is based on the \ninteraction domains that are depicted in Fig. 3. This web of interactions must be \nregulated, both in time and in space, to yield a vectorial progression of CCVs \nthrough many molecular states. \n \nThe actual sequence of molecular events involved in endocytosis is not yet clear. \nThus far, multiple proteins and protein-protein interactions have been implicated in \neach of the many partial reactions involved in endocytic retrieval of SVs. While the \ninformation presented in Section 4 can be assembled into a rudimentary model of SV \nendocytosis, further experimental work will be needed to turn these preliminary \nhypotheses into conclusive definitions of functional roles. An important step toward \nthis goal will be to define the precise times at which each of these interactions occurs \nduring SV endocytosis. Such work eventually will lead to a comprehensive and \nquantitative description of protein and lipid dynamics involved in SV endoytosis.  \nReferences \n1. \nAhle, S. and Ungewickell. E.

L-type Ca2+ currents typically require a \nstrong depolarization for activation, have slow voltage-dependent inactivation, and \nare blocked by the organic L-type Ca2+ channel antagonists, including \ndihydropyridines, phenylalkylamines, and benzothiazepines (79).

Multiple mechanisms directly or indirectly modulate the function \nof these presynaptic Ca2+ channels and thereby regulate synaptic transmission (66, \n17, 7). Ca2+ channels that have been characterized biochemically are complexes of a \npore-forming α1 subunit of approximately 250 kDa with auxiliary β, α2δ, and γ \nsubunits (77, 7, 18). Ten α1 subunits are known in vertebrates, which fall into three \nstructurally and functionally distinct subfamilies (18). The CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 \nchannels are the primary Ca2+ entry pathways at conventional fast synapses, whereas \nribbon synapses in specialized sensory cells have CaV1.3 or CaV1.4 channels (17, 7, \n51). Neuromodulators affect the ability of Cav channels to open, close, or inactivate \nin response to membrane depolarization, and alter the response of these channels to \nrepetitive stimuli (7).

The auxiliary subunits of Ca2+ channels have an \nimportant influence on their function (28, 16). CaVβ subunits greatly enhance cell \nsurface expression of α1 subunits and shift their kinetics and voltage dependence of \nactivation and inactivation. Most CaVβ subunits accelerate activation and voltage-\ndependent inactivation and shift the voltage dependence of gating to more negative \nmembrane potentials, but the CaVβ2a subunit has the opposite effect in most cases. \nThe α2δ subunits also enhance cell surface expression of α1 subunits, but have \nsmaller and less consistent effects on the kinetics and voltage dependence of gating \n(13). The γ subunits do not increase cell surface expression of CaV channels, and in \nsome cases reduce it substantially. The functional role of these subunits of Ca2+ \nchannels is the least well-defined. Although these four auxiliary subunits modulate \nthe functional properties of the Ca2+ channel complex, the pharmacological and \nphysiological diversity of Ca2+ channels arises primarily from the existence of \nmultiple α1 subunits. \n4 Physiological Roles of Calcium Channels in Neurons \nCa2+ channels convert depolarization of the cell surface membrane during the action \npotential into a transient, local increase in intracellular Ca2+, which serves as a \nsecond messenger to initiate many physiological events. In neurons, three of the key \nphysiological events initiated by Ca2+ channels are synaptic integration, synaptic \ntransmission, and gene regulation. All three subfamilies of Ca2+ channels participate \nin Ca2+ signaling in dendrites and cell bodies and in integration of synaptic signals. \nIn contrast, CaV1 and CaV2 channels are specialized for synaptic transmission at \nribbon synapses and fast conventional synapses, respectively (66, 17, 55, 7, 51). Ca2+ \nentering neurons through CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 channels is primarily responsible for \ninitiating synaptic transmission at fast conventional synapses in the peripheral and \ncentral nervous systems (17, 47). CaV2.2 channels, which conduct N-type Ca2+ \ncurrent, are most important at synapses formed by neurons of the peripheral nervous \nsystem. In contrast, CaV2.1 channels, which conduct P/Q-type Ca2+ currents, play the \nmajor role at most synapses formed by neurons of the mammalian central nervous \nsystem. Both CaV2.2 channels and CaV2.3 channels also have a significant role in \ninitiating transmitter release at central synapses. In some neurons, including a subset \nCa2+ channel α1 subunits are encoded by ten distinct genes in mammals (66, 7, \n18). The CaV1 subfamily of channels (CaV1.1 to CaV1.4) conduct L-type Ca2+ \ncurrents. The CaV2 subfamily members (CaV2.1 to CaV2.3) conduct P/Q-type, N-\ntype, and R-type Ca2+ currents, respectively. The CaV3 subfamily members \n(CaV3.1 to CaV3.3) conduct T-type Ca2+ currents. The amino acid sequences of \nthese α1 subunits are more than 70% identical within a subfamily but less than \n40% identical among the three subfamilies. Division of Ca2+ channels into these \nthree subfamilies is phylogenetically ancient, as single representatives of each are \nfound in the C. elegans genome. Evidently, the molecular properties of these three \ndifferent channel families enable them to participate in distinct physiological \npathways."}

On the other hand, CaV2.3 channels \nseem always to play a secondary role at central synapses compared to CaV2.1 and/or \nCaV2.2 channels. The molecular basis for the prominent role of CaV2 channels in \nneurotransmission is not completely understood, but one factor is their direct \ninteractions with the neurotransmitter release machinery in Ca2+ channel signaling \ncomplexes. \n5 Calcium Channel Signaling Complexes \nCa2+ entering neurons through Ca2+ channels forms a transient microdomain of \nhigh Ca2+ concentration in the presynaptic nerve terminal (44, 65, 71). Intracellular \nproteins that must bind Ca2+ to initiate or regulate essential physiological processes \nmust be located near Ca2+ channels in order to receive the Ca2+ signal. In many \ncases, this close localization is achieved by direct interaction with the intracellular \ndomains of Ca2+ channels, which serve as signal transduction platforms for \ncytosolic Ca2+ signaling (7). Similarly, proteins that regulate Ca2+ channels in \nresponse to second messenger signaling are also often directly associated with Ca2+ \nchannels (7). The signaling complexes of presynaptic Ca2+ channels include \ninteractions with the SNARE proteins involved in exocytosis and many Ca2+-\nbinding proteins involved in regulation of channel activity and initiation of Ca2+-\ndependent responses. \n6 Presynaptic Calcium Channels and SNARE Proteins \n6.1 Tight Spatial Co-Localization of Presynaptic Ca2+ Channels and the \nSynaptic Vesicle Release Machinery  \nSynaptic transmission relies on local Ca2+ transients generated near the mouth of \npresynaptic Ca2+ channels, and even Ca2+ entry through a single Ca2+ channel can \ntrigger vesicular release (70). Ca2+-triggered synaptic vesicle exocytosis depends on \nthe assembly of the SNARE complex, the basic fusion machinery, in which the \nvesicle-associated v-SNARE protein synaptobrevin (VAMP) interacts with two \nplasma membrane-associated t-SNARE proteins, SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1 (67, 1, \n75). Maturation into a release-ready synaptic vesicle requires synaptotagmin, an \nintegral Ca2+-binding protein of the synaptic vesicle membrane that provides the \nCa2+-dependent regulation of the fusion machinery. Ca2+ influx into the presynaptic \nterminal triggers the Ca2+ sensor of the fusion machinery, upon which the SNARE \ncomplex binding progresses from a trans- to a cis-state, resulting in the fusion of \napposing membranes and the release of neurotransmitter. \nNeurotransmitter release is initiated within 200 µs after the arrival of the action \npotential and critically depends on Ca2+ influx through high-voltage-activated Ca2+ \nchannels. Exocytosis of synaptic vesicles requires high Ca2+ concentration, with a"}
{"text": "===== Page 6 =====\n152 \nZ.-H. Sheng et al. \n \nthreshold of 10–50 μM and near maximal activation at 200 μM (59). Given that the \nintracellular Ca2+ concentration falls off steeply as a function of the distance away \nfrom the Ca2+ channels, the brief rise in the Ca2+ concentration to the level \nnecessary for exocytosis is thought to occur only in close proximity to the \npresynaptic Ca2+ channels (44) (Fig. 2). Thus, the tightly localized rise in \nintracellular Ca2+ and the subsequent activation of synaptic vesicle fusion suggests \na direct physical link between the Ca2+-channels and the synaptic vesicle release \nmachinery (70, 62) (Fig. 2). \nBiochemical and immunocytochemical studies of brain neurons indicate \nassociation of syntaxin and synaptotagmin with Cav2 channels. Both CaV2.1 and \nCaV2.2 channels localize densely with syntaxin-1 at the presynaptic nerve terminals \nof many neurons and are crucial components in neuronal excitation-secretion \ncoupling (11, 85, 86). Furthermore, these channels can be isolated as a complex with \nSNARE proteins from brain homogenates, suggesting that both types of Cav2 \nchannels are part of the synaptic vesicle fusion complexes (2, 94, 41). These findings \nsparked investigation into what molecular determinants allow these channels to bind \nSNARE proteins and how this interaction regulates synaptic transmission and \nchannel function. \n \n \nFig. 2.

Sheng et al. \n \nsignificance of this biphasic Ca2+–dependent interaction is not yet known, the \nreduction in binding affinity at high Ca2+ levels suggests sequential steps of \nassociation and dissociation of CaV2 channels with the SNARE complex as a \nfunction of Ca2+ concentration in order for fusion to proceed (62). \nFurther structure-function studies defined the molecular determinants of the \nsynprint site responsible for binding to syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25 more completely \n(92). Two different peptide segments, Cav2.2(773–786) and Cav2.2(872–901), are \nindependently required to bind syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25 to two halves of the \nsynprint site, which are separated by a linker sequence that contains a collagen-like \nstrand with repeated proline and glycine residues (Fig. 3b). This structural motif is \npredicted to form an extended, flexible linker connecting the two SNARE-binding \nsegments. Furthermore, the synprint sequence exhibits a high charge density with a \ncharged residue found every 2.5 residues on average and repeated arginine-histidine-\nrich sequences. This hydrophilic structure of the synprint site may hold it near the \nintracellular surface membrane to facilitate interactions with the hydrophilic surface \nof the amphipathic alpha helices of SNARE proteins and provide points of contact \nwith phospholipids in the plasma membrane or in the docked synaptic vesicles, thus \ncontributing to structural tethering of synaptic vesicles near presynaptic Cav2.2 \nchannels. \nCav2.1 channels, which conduct P/Q-type Ca2+ currents, also contain a synprint \nsite in their LII-III. Two isoforms of the α12.1 subunit of Cav2.1 channels, initially \nnamed BI and rbA, have different patterns of interactions with the SNARE proteins \nand exhibit different Ca2+-dependence (58, 34). The BI isoform interacts with both \nsyntaxin-1A and SNAP-25, while the rbA isoform interacts with SNAP-25 but not \nwith syntaxin-1. Given that these Ca2+ channels are differentially distributed in \nsynapses in the central nervous system, the observed differences in the interactions \nbetween the channels and the SNARE proteins may produce subtle variations in the \nefficacy of the initiation of transmitter release in response to Ca2+ influx through \nthese different channels and may confer specialized regulatory properties that \ncontribute to synaptic modulation. \nThe synprint site may be unique to Cav2.1 and Cav2.2 channels, because Cav1 \nchannels lack a similar synprint motif in the corresponding intracellular LII-III region \n(50). However, functional interactions of CaV1.2 channels with SNARE proteins \nhave been reported, suggesting additional interaction mechanisms that do not involve \nthe synprint site (89). \nBoth Cav2.1 and Cav2.2 channels interact with the C-terminal coiled-coil domain \nor H3 helix of syntaxin-1A (181–288), suggesting that Ca2+ channels bind to \nsyntaxin-1 at a C-terminal site near the intracellular surface of the plasma membrane \n(Fig. 3b (61)). The N-terminal sequence (1–69) of syntaxin-1A also binds the \nsynprint site in vitro (31), though it is not clear whether this binding contributes to \nfunctional coupling between the SNARE proteins and Ca2+ channels at nerve \nterminals."}
{"text": "===== Page 9 =====\nInitiation and Regulation of Synaptic Transmission \n155\n \n6.3 Synaptotagmin Binds to Presynaptic Ca2+ Channels \nSynaptotagmin has been widely accepted as the Ca2+-sensor for the SNARE-based \nrelease machinery (21, 74), with synaptotagmins-1, -2, and -9 playing the major role at \nfast synapses (90). Synaptotagmin-1 contains two homologous C2 domains, which \nbind Ca2+ to initiate synchronous transmitter release (74). Biochemical studies have \nrevealed a complex of synaptotagmin-1 and both CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 channels in brain \nhomogenates (63). The synprint site directly binds to the same region in the C2B \ndomain of synaptotagmin-I required for synaptotagmin oligomerization and for AP-2 \nbinding. Two adjacent lysine residues (K326 and K327) within this region are critical \nfor synaptotagmin oligomerization, AP-2, and synprint binding (10). Moreover, \nsyntaxin interacts exclusively with either synprint or synaptotagmin in a Ca2+-\ndependent manner, such that at low Ca2+ concentrations syntaxin-1 binds synprint \nwhereas at higher concentrations (>30 µM) its association with synaptotagmin \nincreases, providing a potential biochemical correlate for the sequential events \noccurring at the synprint site of presynaptic Ca2+ channels during synaptic vesicle \nexocytosis (60). Collectively, these studies suggest a versatile physical link of the \nneuronal CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 channels with the synaptic vesicle fusion machinery, \nenabling tight structural and functional coupling of the sites for Ca2+ entry and \nneurotransmitter release through sequential protein-protein interactions (62). \n6.4 Ca2+ Channel-SNARE Interaction Through the Synprint Site  \nis Important for Efficient Release of Neurotransmitters \nThe Ca2+ concentration at the nerve terminal drops steeply as a function of the \ndistance from Ca2+ entry sites, requiring close association between presynaptic Ca2+ \nchannels and the Ca2+ sensor of the release machinery for efficient initiation of \nexocytosis (72). Maintenance of such a critical intermolecular distance must involve \nanchoring of the release machinery to the source of the Ca2+ influx. Thus, the \nsynprint-mediated interaction of Ca2+ channels and SNARE proteins provides an \nattractive model for interaction with the docked synaptic vesicles spatially localized \nwithin Ca2+ microdomains. \nPeptides derived from the synprint site competitively inhibit interactions between \nSNARE proteins and CaV2 channels in vitro, and therefore provide a potential test of \nthe physiological significance of these interactions. Injection of synprint peptides \nfrom Cav2.2 channels into presynaptic superior cervical ganglion neurons (SCGNs) \nin culture significantly reduced the excitatory postsynaptic response by competitive \nuncoupling of the endogenous Ca2+ channel-SNARE interaction at nerve terminals \n(48). Rapid, synchronous synaptic transmission was selectively inhibited following \nthe injection, while late asynchronous release and paired-pulse facilitation were \nincreased. This is consistent with the assumption that synaptic vesicles are shifted \nfrom an optimally positioned pool for synchronous release to a more distant pool \nlocated too far away for rapid Ca2+ sensor response. Evidently, CaV2.2 channels have \ntwo distinct functional roles in neurotransmitter release: conducting Ca2+ entry and \nserving as a signaling platform for SNARE proteins and docked synaptic vesicles to \nbind and receive the local Ca2+ signal and initiate exocytosis (48)."}
{"text": "===== Page 10 =====\n156 \nZ.-H. Sheng et al. \n \nThe hypothesis that the inhibition of neurotransmitter release by the synprint \npeptides is due to the detachment of CaV2.2 channels from release sites was further \ntested in Xenopus nerve-muscle co-cultures (57). Injection of the synprint peptides \ninto embryonic Xenopus spinal neurons reduced transmitter release by approximately \n50% when cells were stimulated in an extracellular solution containing physiological \nCa2+ concentration. Increasing the external Ca2+ concentrations effectively rescued \nthis inhibition, implying that the Ca2+ channels are competitively displaced away \nfrom docked synaptic vesicles by the injected synprint peptides and this effect can be \novercome by flooding the presynaptic terminal with Ca2+ from the higher \nconcentration in the extracellular pool. \n6.5 Additional Interactions that may Localize the Exocytotic Machinery \nNear Ca2+ Channels \nWhile the studies above indicate that interaction of the synprint site of presynaptic \nCa2+ channels with SNARE proteins enhances the efficiency of neurotransmitter \nrelease in vertebrate neurons, several lines of evidence suggest that this interaction is \nnot absolutely required for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. First, inhibition of synprint \ninteraction or deletion of the synprint site on both Cav2.1 and Cav2.2 channels \nreduces the efficiency of synaptic transmission but does not completely abolish \nsynaptic transmission and vesicle exocytosis (48, 57, 50, 25). Second, although \ninvertebrate Cav2 channels effectively initiate synaptic transmission, they lack a \nsynprint site (68). In invertebrates, other protein-protein interactions may substitute \nfor interaction with the synprint site of Ca2+ channels in spatial organization of the \nexocytosis process (68), or neurotransmitter release may be less dependent on local \norganization than in vertebrates. Splice variants of the human CaV2.2 channels \nlacking the synprint region have been identified, but their localization in nerve \nterminals and their physiological relevance in supporting synaptic transmission are not \nDeletion of the synprint site in the Cav2.1 and Cav2.2 channels also affects \nsynaptic vesicle release at nerve terminals and exocytosis in secretory cells. Deletion \nof the synprint site on the Cav2.1 P/Q-type channel results in a substantial reduction \nin neurotransmitter release in transfected SCG neurons, correlated with reduced \nlocalization of the mutant channels to presynaptic terminals (49, 50). Transfer of the \nsynprint sequence from Cav2.1 to Cav1.2 channels, which conduct L-type Ca2+ \ncurrents and are ineffective in supporting synaptic transmission, is sufficient to allow \nthese channels to initiate synaptic transmission. A related study addressed this issue \nusing mouse pheochromocytoma (MPC) 9/3L cells, which lack voltage-gated Ca2+ \nchannels (25). Compared to cells transiently expressing wild-type Cav2.2 channels, \ncells expressing the synprint deletion mutant showed a substantial reduction in rate \nof secretion determined by capacitance measurements, even though Ca2+ currents \nwere similar regardless of whether synprint is deleted. In addition, in transfected \nneurons in cell culture, localization of CaV2 channels to nerve terminals is \nsubstantially reduced when the synprint site is partially or completely deleted (76). \nThese studies further support the concept that the synprint site is necessary for \nefficient presynaptic localization and functional coupling of Cav2.1 and Cav2.2 \nchannels to vesicle exocytosis (Figs. 2 and 3)."}

These findings raise the question of whether these splice variants couple \nto the synaptic vesicle fusion machinery or have other physiological roles (69). \nThe SNARE proteins are not selectively localized at nerve terminals. Therefore, \nwhile interaction with SNARE proteins may be required for efficient presynaptic \nlocalization, it seems unlikely that interactions with SNARE proteins can serve as a \nprimary targeting mechanism for CaV2 channels. Consistent with this idea, the active \nzone scaffolding proteins Mint and CASK also play critical roles in the presynaptic \ntargeting of CaV2.2 channels via direct interactions with the C-terminal tail of the \nchannels (46). Moreover, in invertebrate Ca2+ channels that lack a synprint site, Mint \nand CASK are required for targeting of presynaptic Ca2+ channels to the synapse (68, \n69). Interactions with Mint and CASK, and perhaps with other unidentified targeting \nproteins, may represent the primary targeting signals required for the localization of \nthe presynaptic Ca2+ channels in the nerve terminals. \n7 Regulation of Presynaptic Ca2+ Channels by SNARE Proteins \n7.1 Biphasic Regulation of Calcium Channel Inactivation by SNARE \nProteins \nIn addition to linking presynaptic Ca2+ channels to the vesicle release machinery, \nsyntaxin-1A and SNAP-25 also regulate channel function. This retrograde regulation \nserves as a negative feedback mechanism for the modulation of synaptic \ntransmission. Co-expression of syntaxin-1A and/or SNAP-25 with Cav2.1 or Cav2.2 \nchannels reduces the availability of the channels to open and shifts the voltage \ndependence of steady-state inactivation towards more negative membrane potentials \n(3, 87, 95). These inhibitory effects of syntaxin on CaV2.2 channels can be reversed \nby co-expressing SNAP-25 (87, 31), and the inhibitory effects of SNAP-25 on \nCaV2.1 channels can be relieved by co-expressing synaptotagmin-1 (88, 95). These \nphysiological data correlate with biochemical observations that syntaxin interacts \nexclusively with either synprint or synaptotagmin in a Ca2+-dependent manner (63). \nThis relief of inhibition of Ca2+ channels by formation of a complete \nsynaptotagmin/SNARE complex favors Ca2+ influx through CaV2 channels near \ndocked synaptic vesicles that are ready for release. Thus, this regulatory mechanism \ncan provide selective Ca2+ entry through CaV2 channels with associated docked \nvesicles, whereas channels associated with only one t-SNARE protein would remain \nrelatively inactive. This regulatory mechanism also allows the modulatory \ninteraction of the channels to be switched on and off at appropriate stages of \nformation of nearby complexes of the SNARE proteins and synaptic vesicles. The \ninhibitory role of syntaxin-1 on channel opening is also abolished in the presence of \nnSec-1, a protein that blocks the assembly of the SNARE complex by locking \nsyntaxin-1 in a closed conformation (31). Altogether, these findings support a \nbiphasic model for the SNARE-mediated modulation of presynaptic Ca2+ channels \nbased on the availability of docked synaptic vesicles nearby that are ready for rapid \nrelease."}
{"text": "===== Page 12 =====\n158 \nZ.-H. Sheng et al. \n \n7.2 Separate Anchoring and Regulatory Sites on Syntaxin-1  \nBy combining site-directed mutagenesis with functional expression in Xenopus \noocytes, Bezprozvanny et al. (4) further addressed whether the anchoring and \nmodulatory interactions between syntaxin-1 and Ca2+ channels are mediated by the \nsame molecular determinants. Their studies showed that the transmembrane region \nand a short segment within the H3 helical cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin-1A are \ncritical for channel modulation but not for binding to the synprint site of the N-\ntype Ca2+ channels. Given that this short segment is buried within the core of the \nfour-helix structure of the SNARE complex, the modulatory action of syntaxin-1A \ncan be enabled only after disassembly of the SNARE complex following synaptic \nvesicle exocytosis. The synprint site binds to the whole H3 region of syntaxin-1A \n(4), in agreement with the previous biochemical findings (61, 60). Deletion of the \nsynprint site weakened the modulation of the channels by syntaxin-1A, but did not \nabolish it, arguing that the synprint sequence acts as an important anchor in \nfacilitating channel modulation but is not absolutely essential for the modulatory \naction. Identification of partially separate anchoring and modulation sites on CaV2 \nchannels provides a means to test the relative roles of these synprint functions in \nsynaptic transmission. \n7.3 Functional Roles of Vesicle Tethering and CaV2 Channel Regulation \nVia the Synprint Site in Synaptic Transmission in vivo \nAt first glance, it seems that interactions of CaV2 channels with SNARE proteins \nhave two opposing effects: tethering synaptic vesicles near the point of Ca2+ entry \nwould increase synaptic transmission whereas enhancing CaV2 channel \ninactivation would reduce synaptic transmission. These effects were dissected by \nuse of competing synprint peptides and mutant syntaxin in Xenopus neuromuscular \njunctions in vivo (33). Injection of competing synprint peptides into developing \nneuromuscular junctions reduced the basal efficiency of synaptic transmission, as \nreflected in increased paired-pulse facilitation and reduced quantal content of \nsynaptic transmission. Evidently, the effect of the synprint peptide to reduce \nlinkage of docked synaptic vesicles to CaV2 channels is predominant, because its \neffect to relieve inhibition of Ca2+ channels by individual plasma membrane \nSNARE proteins would primarily affect channels with no docked vesicles that do \nnot effectively initiate transmitter release. In contrast, over-expression of a \nsyntaxin mutant that is unable to regulate CaV2.2 channels but still binds to them \nincreased the efficiency of synaptic transmission, as reflected in reduced paired-\npulse facilitation and increased quantal content (33). In this case, the syntaxin \nmutant relieves enhanced inactivation of CaV2.2 channels caused by endogenous \nsyntaxin, thereby increasing Ca2+ entry and synaptic transmission, but does not \nalter linkage of docked synaptic vesicles to CaV2.2 channels. These results \ndemonstrate a bidirectional regulation of synaptic transmission in vivo by \ninteractions of SNARE proteins with CaV2.2 channels."}

However, a \nmultitude of presynaptic proteins have been identified that directly participate in \nexocytosis or regulate the synaptic vesicle cycle via interactions with the SNARE \nproteins. These interactions have a potential impact on the modulation of the \nSNARE-CaV2 channel complex. RIM (Rab-Interacting Molecule), an active zone \nprotein that is required for synaptic transmission and is implicated in short- and long-\nterm synaptic plasticity, has also been reported to interact with the synprint region in \nvitro (12). In addition, RIM interacts with CaVβ subunits and shifts the voltage \ndependence of inactivation to more positive membrane potentials, increasing Ca2+ \nchannel activity (35). In the neuroendocrine cell line PC12, interaction of RIM with \nCaV2.2 channels increases docking of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles (35). \nCysteine string protein (CSP) was identified as a synaptic vesicle-associated protein \nwith the ability to modify Ca2+ influx in Drosophila and Torpedo (82). Subsequent \nstudies demonstrated that CSP interacts with the synprint site of CaV2 channels and \nthat this interaction results in a robust tonic inhibition of channel activity by G-\nprotein βγ-subunits (42). Regulation of presynaptic Ca2+ channel function and vesicle \ndocking by RIM and CSP provides additional pathways for control of Ca2+ channel \nactivity in response to the state of nearby docked synaptic vesicles. \n8 Modulation of the SNARE-Synprint Interaction by Protein \nPhosphorylation \nSecond messenger-activated regulation of neurotransmitter release via modulation of \nprotein interactions within the exocytotic apparatus has a potentially important role \nin synaptic plasticity. Several protein kinases, including PKA, PKC, PKG, and \nFurther regulation of the Cav2.2 channels involves the interplay between the synprint \nsite interactions and the second messenger modulation of calcium channels by  \nG-proteins. Stanley and Mirotznik (73) revealed that syntaxin-1A is required for  \nG-protein inhibition of presynaptic calcium channels in intact nerve terminals. \nBotulinum toxin, which cleaves syntaxin-1A, prevents G-protein modulation of \npresynaptic Ca2+ channels in chick calyx synapses, suggesting a crosstalk mechanism \nbetween syntaxin-1A and the G-protein effects on the N-type Ca2+ channels. Further \nstudies by Jarvis et al. (30) showed that the synprint site and Gβ subunit bind to \ndistinct portions of syntaxin-1A and that expression of syntaxin-1A appears to be a \nprerequisite for tonic G-protein inhibition of the N-type Ca2+ channels. These results \nsupport the hypothesis that syntaxin-1A acts as a chaperone by tethering Gβ  to \nCaV2.2 channels in synapses, thus facilitating G-protein regulation."}

Phosphorylation of the synprint peptide by PKC and CaMKII \nin vitro strongly inhibits its binding to recombinant syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25 and \nprevents its association with the native SNARE complex isolated from rat brain \nhomogenates (93). Moreover, PKC phosphorylation blocks the negative shift of \nsteady-state inactivation of Cav2.2 channels, possibly by reducing binding of \nsyntaxin-1 to the synprint site (31). A more detailed analysis of these \nphosphorylation sites reveals a bipartite mode of regulation of SNARE protein \nbinding, in which the two separate domains of the synprint site that each bind \nsyntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 in vitro are regulated by PKC phosphorylation at serines \n774 and 898 and by CaMKII phosphorylation at serines 784 and 896 (92) (Fig. 3b). \nEach phosphorylation site can control syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 binding to half of the \nsynprint site. However, phosphorylation of the intact Cav2.2 channels before \nexposure to syntaxin-1A reduces the binding affinity to syntaxin-1A, but does not \ncompletely prevent binding (92). These observations are consistent with functional \nstudies, in which PKC activation in transfected tsA-201 cells does not completely \ndissociate syntaxin-1A from the channels but does completely reverse the negative \nshift of the voltage dependence of inactivation caused by syntaxin-1A (92). These \nstudies suggest that phosphorylation of the synprint site by PKC or CaMKII may \nserve as a biochemical switch for the SNARE-synprint interaction and regulation of \nchannel function. \n9 Ca2+-Dependent Regulation of Presynaptic Ca2+ Channels \nCa2+ entering presynaptic nerve terminals through Ca2+ channels forms a local micro-\ndomain of high concentration near the intracellular mouth of the channel (44, 65, \n71). In order to respond to this local Ca2+ signal, Ca2+-dependent signaling proteins \nmust be located near the Ca2+ channel in order to sense this Ca2+ transient. Therefore, \nmany proteins that respond to local Ca2+ transients in presynaptic terminals in order \nto initiate or regulate neurotransmission bind directly to the intracellular domains of \nCaV2 channels. \n9.1 Ca2+-dependent Regulation of CaV1 and CaV2 Channels \nAlthough all Cav channels readily conduct both Ca2+ and Ba2+ ions, L-type and P/Q-\ntype Ca2+ currents inactivate strikingly faster than Ba2+ currents (7). This process, \nCa2+-dependent inactivation, prevents Ca2+ overload and refines activity-dependent \nCa2+ signals in excitable cells.

For Cav1.2 channels, calmodulin binds to a consensus \nsite (IQ-domain) in the C-terminal domain of α11.2 ((99). Ca2+ ions permeating the \nchannel bind EF-hand motifs in the N- and C-terminal lobes of calmodulin, causing \nconformational changes that favor inactivation.

During trains of \ndepolarizations, P/Q-type Ca2+ currents increase in size during the first pulses due to \nfacilitation and then inactivate faster during repeated pulses than Ba2+ currents (37) \n(Fig. 4c). Inactivation, but not facilitation, is prevented by a high intracellular \nconcentration of EGTA (10 mM) (37). These results indicate that the facilitation \nprocess has higher affinity and/or more rapid binding of Ca2+ than the inactivation \nprocess. This dual feedback regulation may permit activity-dependent sharpening of \npresynaptic Ca2+ signals underlying synaptic plasticity, providing a boost of synaptic \nefficiency during short trains of impulses and then reduction of synaptic efficacy \nduring long trains. With low concentrations of EGTA (0.5 mM), Ca2+-dependent \ninactivation is also observed for Cav2.2 and Cav2.3 channels (43).

Since the C-terminal lobe \nof calmodulin binds Ca2+ with higher affinity than the N-terminal lobe, the \ndependence of Ca2+-dependent facilitation of CaV2.1 channels on the C-terminal of \ncalmodulin may be responsible for its ability to respond to local increases in Ca2+ in \nthe presence of a high concentration of EGTA. Similarly, the increased Ca2+-buffer \nsensitivity of Ca2+-dependent inactivation for Cav2.1 channels compared to Cav1.2 \nchannels may reflect Ca2+ binding to the lower affinity N-terminal lobe for \ninactivation of CaV2.1 channels versus the higher affinity C-terminal lobe for CaV2.1 \nchannels."}

Like calmodulin, CaBP1 binds to the CBD of α12.1, but its binding is Ca2+-\nindependent (38). It causes rapid inactivation that is independent of Ca2+, and it does \nnot support Ca2+-dependent facilitation (38) (Fig. 4c).

At least one of the N-terminal EF-hands of the \nnCaBPs is nonfunctional in Ca2+ binding due to changes in amino acid sequence, and \nsome of the nCaBPs are myristolyated at their N-terminus (5). nCaBPs are similar \nenough to displace calmodulin from shared binding sites in the α1 subunits of CaV \nchannels, but different enough to confer distinct forms of regulation."}

When \ncotransfected with Cav2.1 channels in mammalian cells, VILIP-2 does not affect \nCa2+-dependent facilitation, but inhibits Ca2+-dependent and voltage-dependent \ninactivation (36) (Fig. 4c). These effects of VILIP-2 may involve displacement of \ncalmodulin from the CBD, because both the CBD and IQ-like motifs of α12.1 are \nrequired for binding of VILIP-2. Thus, CaBP-1 and VILIP-2 bind to the same site as \ncalmodulin but have differential effects on CaV2.1 channel activity. In a presynaptic \nterminal, these differential effects on facilitation and inactivation of the P/Q-type \nCa2+ current would substantially change the encoding properties of the synapse in \nresponse to trains of action potentials (97). \nHow can VILIP-2 and CaBP1 have such opposing effects on Cav2.1 function? \nThe mechanism for these effects is not yet clear, but both proteins must be \nmyristolyated on the N-termini to have their distinctive regulatory effects (19). \nBecause calmodulin is not myristoylated at its N-terminal and does not have an \ninactive N-terminal EF-hand, it is tempting to think that differential interactions of \nthe inactive EF-hands in the N-terminal domains of these Ca2+-binding proteins with \nthe IQ-like domain and CBD of CaV2.1 channels are responsible for their differences \nin action. The divergent actions of nCaBPs on Cav2.1 channels may fine-tune the \nfunction and regulatory properties of presynaptic P/Q-type Ca2+ currents, allowing a \ngreater range of input-output relationships and short-term plasticity at different \nsynapses. \nCav2.1 channels also interact with other CaBPs, including neuronal Ca2+ sensor-1 \n(NCS-1), which has inhibitory effects on the amplitude of P/Q-type Ca2+ currents in \nadrenal chromaffin cells that are mediated by a tyrosine kinase signaling pathway \n(83, 5, 84). However, injection of purified NCS-1 protein into presynaptic nerve \nterminals at the calyx of Held synapse promotes facilitation of P/Q-type currents, and \nactivity-dependent facilitation of P/Q-type currents at this synapse can be prevented \nby injection of NCS-1-inhibitor peptides (81). Similarly, NCS-1 can enhance \nfacilitation of synaptic transmission in cultured hippocampal neurons (64). \nTherefore, the effects of NCS-1 on Cav2.1 channels may depend on the cellular \ncontext in which they are co-expressed, but in synapses it appears to act as an \nenhancer of Ca2+ channel activity and synaptic transmission. \n10.2 Regulation of Cav1 Channels by CaBP \nThe Cav1 family of Ca2+ channels are also differentially regulated by CaBPs (96). \nUnlike its inhibitory effects on Cav2.1 channels, CaBP1 prolongs Cav1.2 Ca2+ \ncurrents and completely abolishes Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent inactivation. The \nopposing actions of calmodulin and CaBP1 on Cav1.2 depend on differences in how \nthe two interact with the channel (96). CaBP1 binds to the IQ-domain as well as to a \nsite in the N-terminal domain of the α11.2 subunit. Deletion of the N-terminal site \nprevents the effects of CaBP1 but not calmodulin on Cav1.2 inactivation. In contrast, \nIQ-EE substitutions in the IQ-domain prevent calmodulin-dependent inactivation, \nbut partially spare the effects of CaBP1. Interestingly, a CaBP1 variant, caldendrin, \ncauses more modest suppression of Cav1.2 Ca2+-dependent inactivation than CaBP1 \nthrough interactions solely with the IQ-domain and not the N-terminal site in α11.2"}
{"text": "===== Page 19 =====\nInitiation and Regulation of Synaptic Transmission \n165\n \n(78). CaBP1 and caldendrin associate and colocalize with Cav1.2 in somatodendritic \ndomains of neurons, and so may help fine-tune and boost postsynaptic Ca2+ signals \nconducted by Cav2.1, which regulate gene transcription and neuronal excitability. \n11 Regulation of CaV2 Channels and Synaptic Plasticity \nCaV1.4 channels conduct L-type Ca2+ currents that initiate transmitter release at \nspecialized ribbon synapses in sensory cells in the retinal photoreceptors and bipolar \ncells (26). CaV1.4 channels interact with the calmodulin-like Ca2+ binding protein \nCaBP4, which is essential for normal formation and function of the photoreceptor \nsynapse. Interaction with CaBP-4 increases CaV1.4 channel activity by negatively \nshifting its voltage dependence of activation. This regulatory effect of CaBP4 may \nregulate synaptic transmission at the ribbon synapses of photoreceptor cells (22). \nShort-term synaptic plasticity of neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals \nshapes the response of postsynaptic neurons to bursts of impulses and is crucial for \nfine-grained encoding of information in the nervous system (97). This form of \nsynaptic plasticity is thought to be mediated by residual Ca2+ in the cytosol of the \npresynaptic terminal remaining from previous stimuli, but the molecular mechanisms \nresponsible for this form of synaptic plasticity are unknown. During trains of stimuli \nat many synapses, facilitation of neurotransmitter release increases the postsynaptic \nresponse, and subsequent depression of neurotransmitter release reduces it. Activity-\ndependent regulation of presynaptic calcium channels is predicted to have profound \neffects on short-term synaptic plasticity because the amount of neurotransmitter \nreleased at a synapse is steeply dependent on calcium entry, approximately \nproportional to n3.5 of extracellular Ca2+ (15). In order to critically test the role of \nactivity-dependent regulation of presynaptic calcium channels via calmodulin and \nnCaBPs in short-term synaptic plasticity, it is necessary to compare synaptic \ntransmission initiated by wild-type CaV2.1 channels and by mutant channels with \nimpaired activity-dependent regulation. This is a challenging experiment because \nendogenous Ca2+ channels are present in high concentration in presynaptic active \nzones, and replacement of them with exogenously expressed mutant Ca2+ channels is \ndifficult. Cultured superior cervical ganglion neurons can be transfected successfully \nwith cDNA encoding CaV2.1 channels by microinjection, and these transfected \nneurons then express functional CaV2.1 channels in their cell bodies and synapses \n(49). Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings of transfected CaV2.1 channels at the cell \nbody show that they undergo Ca2+-dependent facilitation like CaV2.1 channels \nexpressed in non-neuronal cells (50a). The contribution of these transfected CaV2.1 \nchannels to initiation of synaptic transmission can then be determined by blocking \nthe endogenous N-type calcium current specifically with ω-conotoxin GVIA. \nExcitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) recorded in the postsynaptic neurons in \nresponse to action potentials elicited in the presynaptic neuron are approximately 30–\n40% of the size of those initiated by endogenous N-type Ca2+ currents (49). In \ncontrast, transfected CaV1.2 channels and CaV2.3 channels are much less effective \n(49). Recent studies using this model synaptic system show that activity-dependent \nfacilitation and inactivation of transfected CaV2.1 channels mediated by nCaBPs"}

First, the presynaptic Ca2+ channel provides the rapid, spatially focused \nCa2+ entry that initiates synaptic transmission. Second, through specific protein-\nprotein interactions with SNARE proteins and scaffolding proteins, the presynaptic \nCa2+ channels bring docked synaptic vesicles close to the source of Ca2+ entry, allow \nthem to respond efficiently to the micordomain of high Ca2+ concentration, and \nmediate regulatory effects that serve to focus Ca2+ entry on sites with docked \nsynaptic vesicles. Third, through specific protein-protein interactions with Ca2+-\nbinding proteins, the presynaptic Ca2+ channels respond to residual Ca2+ in nerve \nterminals and mediate important aspects of short-term synaptic plasticity, including \npaired-pulse facilitation and depression, and facilitation and depression during trains \nof stimuli. \nReferences \n1. \nBajjalieh, S.M. and Scheller, R.H.

Presynaptic expression of the pore-forming α12.1 subunit containing a \nmutation in the IQ-like motif in the C-terminal domain that blocks Ca2+/calmodulin-\ndependent facilitation of P/Q-type calcium currents prevented paired-pulse \nfacilitation and markedly reduced synaptic facilitation and augmentation during \ntrains of stimuli (50a). Deletion of the nearby calmodulin-binding domain (CBD), \nwhich reduces Ca2+-dependent inactivation in heterologous expression systems, \nprevented paired-pulse depression and also substantially reduced depression of \nEPSPs during trains of action potentials (50a). These results establish a new \nmolecular mechanism for the action for residual Ca2+ in presynaptic terminals, long \nknown to be important in short-term synaptic plasticity. Residual Ca2+ induces \nsynaptic \nfacilitation \nand \naugmentation \nthrough \nCa2+/calmodulin-dependent \nfacilitation of the activity of presynaptic CaV2.1 channels. Furthermore, \nCa2+/calmodulin-dependent inactivation of presynaptic calcium channels, not vesicle \ndepletion, is the primary cause of the rapid phase of synaptic depression at this \nmodel synapse. These results point to activity-dependent dual regulation of \npresynaptic Ca2+ channels by calmodulin and nCaBP proteins as a primary \ndeterminant of short-term synaptic plasticity and information-processing in the \nnervous system."}

Communication between neurons is mediated mainly by chemical synapses, at \nwhich neurotransmitters are released by the presynaptic neuron, diffuse across the narrow \ncleft, and activate receptors located on postsynaptic neurons. Synapses provide the structural \nand functional basis for the formation and maintenance of the complex neural networks that \nexist in the brain. This process is governed by the number, type, and location of synapses \ncontrol synapse maturation, specificity and function. Thus, disruption of the adhesive proper-\nties of these molecules not only compromises synaptic transmission, but also many aspects of \nbrain function that control memory formation and behavior. Here, I will describe the various \nstages of synaptogenesis, with focus on adhesion molecules that regulate contact initiation, \nsynapse maturation/stabilization or elimination, and synaptic plasticity. Emphasis will be on \nthe potential mechanisms that regulate adhesion molecule recruitment and function at the \nsynapse. I will also discuss how dysfunction in specific adhesive systems may contribute to \nsynaptic imbalance and the development of brain disorders. \n1 Introduction \n1.1 Mechanisms That Govern Synapse Development \nSynapses form when axons reach their target cells and establish stable contacts \nwith them. This process requires spatially and temporally controlled changes in \ncontact structure as well as recruitment of specific proteins to contact sites (18, 26, \n39, 45, 74, 75, 154, 191, 197). The axon terminal, the so-called presynaptic side, is \nengorged with synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters, the chemical basis \nof neuron to neuron communication. These vesicles are docked on the presynaptic \nmembrane, attached by a complex cytomatrix of proteins, primed for the proper \nsignal for release. At postsynaptic sites, neurotransmitter receptors and a wide \nformed. Therefore, specialized molecular machinery must exist to ensure assembly of appro-\npriate synaptic partners. There is considerable evidence that synaptic contact formation and \nremodeling is regulated by adhesion molecules that modulate the stabilization and mainte-\nnance of initial contacts between neuronal cells, as well as recruitment of other molecules that \nJ.W.

The hallmark of CLAMs distinguishing \nthem from cholinesterases is the lack of various residues in the catalytic triad of the \nextracellular cholinesterase-like domain, rendering these proteins enzymatically \ninactive. Four genes encoding neuroligin family members have been identified in \nrodents, with at least five genes coding for neuroligins in humans (12). Neuroligins \nare type I transmembrane proteins containing three major domains that regulate their \nfunction: a cholinesterase-like domain (CLD), an O-glycosylation cassette, and a \nSynGAP, as well as the excitatory neurotransmitter receptor subunit NR1. Some of the mole-\ncules thought to regulate neuroligin actions in excitatory synapse maturation as well as mole-\ncules involved in modulating synaptic strength, retrograde signaling and plasticity are \nindicated.

The extracellular \nregion of neuroligins is thought to mediate receptor/ligand-like interaction implicated \nin cell–cell adhesion. Comparison of rat sequences revealed that the intracellular \nregions are the least conserved, with only 31% identity. As such, this divergence \nmay underlie the differential localizations and/or functions of neuroligin family \nmembers. Neuroligin-1, the most characterized member of the family, was first puri-\nfied from brain lysates by affinity chromatography on immobilized neurexin 1β \nlacking an insert in the alternatively spliced G domain, also referred as splice site 4 \n(90). Additional neuroligin family members have subsequently been identified as \nsplice-site specific ligands for β-neurexins (91). \nNeurexins are the products of three genes, from which two classes of mRNAs \nare generated: long mRNAs encoding the α-neurexins, and short mRNAs which \nencode the β-neurexins. Thus, at least 6 principal neurexin isoforms are expressed in \nthe brain; three α-neurexins (Iα, IIα, IIIα) and three β-neurexins (Iβ, IIβ, IIIβ) (180, \n181). Both α- and β-neurexins are single transmembrane proteins, with distinct N-\nterminal sequences that contain the LNS domain, named after repeated sequences of \nLaminin A, Neurexin, and Sex hormone-binding protein. LNS domains are also \nreferred to as G domains, in reference to domain repeats present in laminin A, agrin, \nand slit, proteins implicated in cell recognition processes during development of the \nnervous system (182, 148). In α-neurexin, the LNS domains are part of a three-\nrepeat cassette, each repeat containing 2 LNS domains (A and B) separated by an \nepidermal growth factor-like (EGF) sequence. In comparison, β-neurexins contain \nonly the last LNS unit, which is preceded by a β-neurexin-specific sequence result-\ning from the N-terminal truncation of a long, atypical signal peptide (181, 182). In all \nneurexins, the last LNS unit is followed by a carbohydrate attachment sequence, a \nsingle transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic tail containing a type II PDZ \nrecognition motif. Neurexins also have multiple alternatively spliced regions making \nthem highly polymorphic. Neuroligins can bind to both α- and β-neurexins, depend-\ning on alternative splicing of neuroligins at splice site B (13). \n2.3 Balancing Excitation and Inhibition by Neuroligins and Neurexins \nAn important finding emerging from recent studies on the effects of neuroligins on \nsynapse induction, is their ability to influence not only excitatory synapse develop-\nment, but also inhibitory synapse differentiation and function (31, 33, 119, 143, 184). \nThe first evidence for a role for neuroligins in driving maturation of inhibitory syn-\napses came from work performed by Prange et al. (143), showing that neuroligin-1 \nnot only induces excitatory presynaptic contact formation, but also the maturation of \nGABAergic synapses when overexpressed in hippocampal neurons (143). Later, it \nwas discovered that these effects can be reproduced to varying extents by all mem-\nbers of the neuroligin family (30, 80, 117). Endogenously however, neuroligin-1 and \n-3 are enriched at excitatory synapses, whereas neuroligin-2 is found mainly at in-\nhibitory synapses (31, 117, 166, 185). \nThe effects on excitatory and inhibitory contacts seem to require coupling to \nneurexin, since application of soluble β-neurexin extracellular domain reduced"}
{"text": "===== Page 8 =====\n180 \nA. El-Husseini \n \nfrequency of excitatory and inhibitory currents (118). Other studies showed that β-\nneurexin has the ability to induce the clustering of neuroligins and other postsynaptic \nproteins normally present at both types of synapses. Moreover, while neuroligin-1, -\n3, and –4 co-aggregated mainly with PSD-95, neuroligin-2 co-aggregated signifi-\ncantly more with gephyrin, a scaffolding protein found mainly at inhibitory postsy-\nnaptic sites (80). Studies of a similar design showed that coexpression of neuroligin-\nfunctional GABAergic synapses (53). Interestingly, while presentation of β-neurexin \ninduces clustering of both PSD-95 and NMDA receptors, no clustering of AMPA \ntype glutamate receptors was observed (80, 131). Additional experiments demon-\nstrated that AMPA receptors are recruited upon application of glutamate or overex-\nto resemble silent synapses which become functional at later stages of synapse de-\nvelopment, via recruitment of AMPA receptors. However, despite the ability of \nneuroligins to induce recruitment of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins to \ncontact sites, their physiological role seems to be more to exert specific effects on \nsynaptic activity. For example, neuroligin-1 expressed in both non-neuronal and \nneuronal cells enhances excitatory synaptic activity, while expression of neuroligin-2 \nenhances inhibitory synaptic currents (33, 53, 70, 131, 165). Further work must be \ncarried out to clarify mechanisms that control targeting and function of specific neu-\nroligins at different synapse types. \nIn addition to modulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapse maturation, \nrecent evidence indicates that neuroligins also enhance nicotinic synapse maturation \n(36). Namely, overexpression of neuroligins in neurons induces presynaptic speciali-\nzations in adjacent cholinergic neurons. In addition, manipulation of endogenous \nneuroligin function with dominant negative constructs and siRNA compromises \nnicotinic synaptic function. How neuroligins are able to drive the maturation of het-\nerogeneous types of synapses using the same presynaptic partner remains unclear. \nSecondary presynaptic binding partners or crosstalk with other adhesion systems \nmay account for this phenomenon, but this remains to be determined. \n2.4 Regulation of Neuroligin/Neurexin Trafficking and Assembly \nRecent studies revealed that neuroligins and neurexins have the inherent ability to \naffect both excitatory and inhibitory synapse maturation. The question then arises, if \nneuroligins and neurexins have the ability to modulate both types of contacts, what \naccounts for their proper sorting to a particular synapse in vivo? One potential \nmechanism that influences the recruitment of neuroligins to particular synapse types, \nis alternative splicing (90, 91). Although the N-terminal regions of neuroligins share \na relatively high degree of sequence similarity, the splice sites found within these \nregions provide differing sequences which may be used to direct targeting of these \nmolecules to excitatory versus inhibitory synapses (13, 79, 80). Indeed, a recent \nstudy has shown that neuroligins lacking insert at splice site B target more efficiently \nto inhibitory synapses, while those containing an insert at this splice site localize \nmainly to excitatory synapses. Thus, this splice code guides the specific binding of \nparticular neuroligin and neurexin variants (39, 122). A 30-residue insert at splice \n2 and GABAA receptors in non-neuronal cells is sufficient for reconstitution of \npression of CaMKII in neurons (131). Thus, synapses induced by neuroligins seem"}
{"text": "===== Page 9 =====\nAdhesion Molecules at the Synapse\n181\n \n \n \nsite 4 of β-neurexins reduces the affinity of interaction specifically with neuroligin-1 \nthat contains an insert at splice site B, and promotes GABAergic synapse develop-\nment. In contrast, the presence of an insert at site B of neuroligin-1, which is the \npredominantly expressed neuroligin-1 protein, promotes targeting to glutamatergic \nsynapses (32). The basis for the binding affinity of alternatively spliced neuroligin \nfor neurexins appears to be protein glycosylation. N-glycosylation at Asn 303 lo-\ncated in splice site B containing insert hinders binding of neuroligin-1 to neurexin \n1β. In contrast, neuroligin-1 lacking the insert at splice site B binds both β- and α-\nneurexins (13). These results suggest that differential combinations of neuroligin and \nneurexin isoforms at contact sites activate distinct signaling codes that specify par-\nticular synaptic properties. Whether the spatial and temporal expression of these \nsplice variants control synapse specificity remains an open question. \nIntracellular binding partners of neuroligins and neurexins also influence the dif-\nferential targeting of specific neuroligin family members, which would direct the \neffects of a particular neuroligin to one synapse type over another. In addition to \npossessing PDZ-binding motifs, the C-termini of neuroligins show the highest degree \nof sequence divergence, and may therefore provide a basis for different family mem-\nbers trafficking to distinct synapse types. For instance, coexpression of neuroligin-1 \nor -2 with the excitatory scaffold protein, PSD-95, restricts the presynaptic-inducing \neffects of neuroligins to excitatory contacts (117, 143). By assembling a core com-\nplex containing stargazin, AMPA receptors, and cell adhesion molecules, PSD-95 \nand other scaffolding proteins found in the PSD may therefore determine excitatory \nsynapse identity, whereas other unidentified adaptor proteins may control sorting and \nstabilization of cell adhesion molecules at inhibitory postsynaptic sites (16, 59). \nOther molecules that potentially contribute to differential retention of neuroligins \nat excitatory and inhibitory synapses include shank, GRIP, gephyrin and dystrogly-\ncan (39, 75, 115, 116, 122, 124). Shank is a PDZ protein enriched at glutamatergic \nsynapses, and has been shown to influence spine morphology and presynaptic func-\ntion (76, 145, 152, 153, 163). The GRIP proteins (GRIP1 and GRIP2, also known as \nABP; AMPA receptor binding protein) represents another important family of scaf-\nfolding molecules, whose members contain up to seven PDZ domains and have been \nimplicated in clustering of glutamate receptors (22, 28, 44, 49, 52, 87, 99, 120, 135, \n136). GRIP family members were initially identified by their association with the \nGluR2/GluR3 subunits of the AMPA receptor, which bind to the fourth and fifth \nPDZ domains of GRIP. Disruption of the GluR2-GRIP interaction inhibits accumula-\ntion of AMPA receptors at the synapse. In addition, other studies have shown that \nGRIP is also present at inhibitory synapses. Thus, members of the GRIP family \ncomprise another class of proteins potentially involved in sequestration of neu-\nroligins to excitatory and inhibitory contacts. Gephyrin is a molecule concentrated \nwithin the postsynaptic domain of GABAergic synapses, that has been implicated in \n108, 114, 116). A direct interaction between gephyrin and neuroligins has not been \nassessed, and thus it remains a possibility that gephyrin directly influences neuroligin \ntrafficking, or does so indirectly, through other factors that influence the function of \nneuroligins at inhibitory synapses. Another molecule enriched at inhibitory synapses is \ndystroglycan, a protein composed of an extracellular α subunit and a transmembrane \nclustering of GABAA receptor subunits in hippocampal neurons (19, 42, 65, 107,"}
{"text": "===== Page 10 =====\n182 \nA. El-Husseini \n \nβ subunit. β-Dystroglycan binds dystrophin and utrophin intracellularly, while α-\ndystroglycan binds several matrix molecules including agrin, laminin, and perlecan \nextracellularly (115). The binding of dystroglycan to neurexin makes it a good can-\ndidate for modulating the effects of neuroligin/neurexin on synapse development \n(172). Thus, interplay between these molecules influences assembly of neuroligins at \nboth excitatory and inhibitory synapses. \nMechanisms that control early sorting and delivery of individual neuroligin \nmolecules to nascent neuronal contacts are less understood. To address this issue, we \nhave monitored the mobility of neuroligin molecules at synaptic sites (Fig. 4). \n \n \nFig. 4. Differential mobility of neuroligins at synaptic sites.

Recent data also show that the assembly of a complex of \nscaffold proteins containing neuroligin-1 may precede the recruitment of presynaptic \nvesicle proteins and the machinery required for active recycling of neurotransmitter. \nIn this case, the presence of postsynaptic proteins such as neuroligins may facilitate \nrecruitment of presynaptic molecules important for vesicular release (76). Previous \nstudies, however, demonstrated that recruitment of PSD-95 can also occur after the \nestablishment of an active presynaptic terminal (1, 17, 69). Although the role of \nadhesion complexes was not examined in these studies, the presumed role of neu-\nroligin would be to recruit PSD-95 to these sites. Another study looking at nascent \ncontacts made by axonal filopodia highlighted the rapid recruitment of NMDA-type \nglutamate receptors independently of PSD-95, before the establishment of an active \npresynaptic terminal (190). Thus, it will be important to distinguish between traffick-\ning of newly synthesized neuroligin molecules and retention of pre-existing protein \nat the cell surface and synaptic sites. Perhaps the role of PSD-95 relates more to the \nformer at earlier stages of synaptic development during the assembly of postsynaptic \nproteins. At mature synapses, PSD-95 may restrict the mobility of neuroligins at the \nsynapse and thus modulate their retention at particular contact sites. \nLess is known about binding partners that influence neurexin targeting and func-\ntion at presynaptic sites. The interaction between α-neurexins and neurexophilins, a \nfamily of secreted glycoproteins, has been suggested to mediate cell signaling (126, \n140). Another extracellular ligand of both α- and β-neurexins is dystroglycan (172). \nAlthough the functional relevance of this interaction is uncertain, it has been sug-\ngested that it may regulate cell adhesion at inhibitory contacts. Intracellularly, neur-\nexins are coupled to CASK, which forms a stoichiometric complex with Mint-1 (also \ncalled X11 or Lin-10) and Velis (also called MALS or Lin-7) potentially involved in \norganizing presynaptic vesicle release machinery (5, 23). In CASK-deficient neu-\nrons, glutamatergic spontaneous synaptic release events are increased, and GABAer-\ngic synaptic release events are decreased, indicating that coupling of neurexins to \nthese scaffolding molecules may modulate presynaptic release. \n2.5 Other Mechanisms that Regulate Neuroligin/Neurexin Assembly  \nand Function \nOther mechanisms that control neuroligin/neurexin interaction and function include \ncalcium binding, glycosylation, and oligomerization (13, 32, 34, 35, 90, 181). Neu-\nroligin/β-neurexin binding requires only low Ca2+ concentrations, and thus under \nphysiological conditions, changes in Ca2+ levels at the synaptic cleft following syn-\naptic activation may not influence association of these molecules at the synapse. \nNeuronal depolarization, however, may modulate splicing of specific isoforms of α-\nneurexins, particularly at splice sites 1 and 3 (146). Another mechanism that poten-\ntially modulates the function of neuroligins is protein oligomerization. Neuroligin-1 \nmutants which fail to cluster neurexins and induce presynaptic differentiation also \nshow disrupted formation of neuroligin-1 homo-oligomers (47). These results high-"}

It is possible that intermolecular binding occurs \nbetween different neuroligin family members, resulting in the formation of neu-\nroligin hetero-oligomers. This may have implications in modulating neuroligin-\ndirected recruitment of specific molecules at the synapse. \nRecent evidence shows that postsynaptically localized β-neurexin inhibits trans-\nbinding of neuroligin-1 to presynaptic neurexins, blocking synaptogenic activity \n(177). These results suggest that postsynaptic interactions between neuroligins and \nneurexins provide a mechanism for silencing the activity of this adhesion complex. \nThis finding presents yet further insight into mechanisms potentially involved in \nmodulating excitation and inhibition via neuroligin-neurexin interaction. Other stud-\nies showed that retrograde signaling through the neuroligin/neurexin protein complex \nmodulates the release probability of synaptic transmitter vesicles due to alterations in \npresynaptic short-term plasticity (72). \n2.6 In Vivo Assessment of the Function of Neurexins and Neuroligins \nneurexins in Ca2+-regulated neurotransmitter release, potentially through coupling N- \nand P/Q-type calcium channels to the presynaptic exocytotic machinery (54, 55, 125, \n128, 167, 200). Mice lacking all three α-neurexins show reduced neurotransmitter \nrelease at excitatory and inhibitory synapses and die at early postnatal stages. How-\never, no gross anatomical defects or changes in the distribution of synaptic proteins \nor axonal projections were observed. Structural alterations observed include a 20% \nreduction of neuropil area in many brain regions, due to shortened distal dendritic \nbranches and fewer spines. A moderate decrease (30%) in inhibitory synapse number \nin the neocortex was also observed, indicating that neurexin function is likely more \ncritical for inhibitory synapse maturation. Overall, these studies illustrate that α-\nneurexins are not essential for the formation of the majority of synapses in vivo. \nHowever, it is possible that the expression of β-neurexins or other adhesion systems \nmay have compensated for the loss of α-neurexins in these mice. In contrast, studies \non flies mutant for α-neurexin show that this adhesion molecule is required for syn-\napse formation and associative learning (199). Neurexin-1 mutant flies are viable and \nfertile, but exhibit a decrease in synapse number and have shortened lifespan. Similar \ninvestigations on mice lacking neuroligins show that neuroligins are essential for \nsurvival but not for CNS synapse formation (184). Despite a significant reduction in \nthe expression of many presynaptic proteins, there were no obvious changes in syn-\napse number or morphology in many brain areas examined. Interestingly, mice lack-\ning neuroligins 1–3 die shortly after birth due to respiratory failure (184). In these \nmutant animals, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission is impaired in the \nbrainstem respiratory center. A shift in the balance between excitation and inhibition \nmost likely accounts for the defects in the respiratory control system, indicating that \nneuroligins and neurexins are not necessary for synapse induction, but rather for \nsurvival and for the regulation of specific aspects of synapse maturation that control \nsynaptic strength, signaling and function.

After contact formation between pre- and postsynaptic \nneurons, recruitment of neuroligin and neurexin may trigger coordinated recruitment of pre-\nsynaptic protein packets and postsynaptic scaffold complexes to control synapse stabilization \nand maturation (middle panel).

Enhanced association of \nneuroligin/neurexin by increased protein delivery to/retention at the synapse will strengthen \ntrans-synaptic signaling (right panel). In contrast, uncoupling of the neuroligin/neurexin com-\nplex may result in reduced synaptic strength. \n2.7 Potential Link to Neurodevelopmental Disorders \nRecent studies indicate that altered synapse formation and maturation is the leading \ncause of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia (202). \nDefects in spine maturation have been implicated in many forms of mental retarda-\ntion and memory impairment. Autism and Asperger syndrome are classified as per-\nvasive developmental disorders, also referred to as autism-spectrum disorders \n(ASD). These syndromes are characterized by varying degrees of abnormality in \ncommunication ability and social interactions, as well as repetitive and stereotyped \npatterns of behavior. A number of twin and other family studies have supported a \nstrong genetic component in autism. Although intensive genetic research in recent \nyears has identified a number of genes that may be involved in the pathology of \nautism, the biological mechanisms underlying neurological deficits remain poorly \nunderstood. It has been hypothesized that the behavioral and cognitive deficits found \nin autistic patients may result from alterations in neuronal circuitry implicated in \nsensory, mnemonic, social and emotional information processing. Neuroimaging and \nneuropathological studies of these circuits in autistic patients have provided impor-\ntant insights into the etiology of autism, leading to a model that could explain the"}

This model postulates that an increase in the ratio of excita-\ntion/inhibition in neural circuits involved in information processing may underlie the \ndysfunctions characteristic of autism (147). Considering the role of neuroligins in \ncontrolling the function of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, these proteins are \ngood candidate genes for being affected in these disorders. Indeed, rearrangement of \nchromosomal regions harboring neuroligin-1, -2 and PSD-95 genes have been asso-\nciated with autism (6, 111, 202). Two mutations in the X-chromosomal neuroligin \ngenes, neuroligin-3 and -4, have also been linked to some forms of autism, including \nAsperger syndrome (94). The associated mutation in neuroligin-3 consisted of a \nsubstitution of Arg451 for Cys (R451C), resulting in a missense mutation. In the case \nof neuroligin-4, a novel insertion at position 396 (D396X) resulted in a frame shift \nand premature termination of the transcript. Support for the involvement of neu-\nroligin-4 in autism was provided by another genetic study of a large French family \nwith members affected by non-specific X-linked mental retardation with or without \nautism or pervasive developmental disorders. In the latter study, another frame-shift \nmutation in neuroligin-4 was identified (113). In this case, a 2-base-pair deletion was \nfound to generate a stop codon in the middle of the protein, leading to the formation \nof a truncated protein lacking sequences crucial for neuroligin dimerization required \nfor binding to β-neurexins, as well as the transmembrane and intracellular domains. \nThe fact that this mutation was found in both autistic and non-autistic mentally re-\ntarded patients indicates that neuroligin-4 may be implicated in both autism and \nmental retardation. Since neuroligin-associated disorders seem to include both au-\ntism and mental retardation, it suggests these two syndromes may share a common \nsynaptically modulated mechanism (63). \nRecent linkage and copy number variation analyses also implicate chromosome \n11p12–p13 and neurexins, respectively, among other candidate associated with \n3 Synapse Induction by Members of the IgG Superfamily \nSimilar to neuroligins, SynCAM1 (Synaptic Cell Adhesion Molecule) has been \nshown to promote presynaptic differentiation at contacts between axons and het-\nerologous cells, and to drive the recruitment of synaptic proteins at sites of contact \n(10, 47, 157).

There are three other genes encoding SynCAM, and heterophilic \nadhesion between the various SynCAM isoforms has been demonstrated (164). \nHowever, the function of other SynCAM isoforms and the consequences of hetero-\nphilic binding between them have not been studied in neurons. At the presynaptic \nterminal, the known protein interaction motifs in the cytosolic tails of SynCAM1 and \nβ-neurexins are highly conserved. They therefore presumably bind the same adaptor \nproteins. Although SynCAMs and neuroligins are strong inducers of synapses, it \nappears that synapses induced by these adhesion molecules are functionally distinct \n(156). The artificial presynaptic terminals induced by these molecules on heterolo-\ngous cells are identical in all parameters measured, and to true synapses. Overex-\npression in neurons however, produced different effects. SynCAM1 specifically \npromotes excitatory synaptic transmission. Moreover, only expression of SynCAM1 \nincreased synaptic function by electrophysiological measures, whereas morphologi-\ncal analysis revealed the opposite, only neuroligin increased synapse number (156). \nIn contrast, other studies have used electrophysiology to show increased synaptic \nfunction in neuroligin overexpressing neurons (117, 143), and that knockdown of \nneuroligin diminishes synaptic function and activity (30). The differences between \nthese observations may be explained by variations in levels of protein overexpression \n3.2 NGLs and SALMS \nNeuronal proteins containing leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), such as the Nogo-66 re-\nceptor, Slit, AMIGO, LINGO, NGL, and NLRR, have been implicated in neurite \noutgrowth and cell migration (102, 109). However, recent studies revealed that par-\nticular members of LRR containing proteins regulate synaptogenesis. Examples \ninclude the netrin G ligands (NGLs) and synaptic adhesion-like molecules (SALMs), \nmolecules that belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins (109, 110, \n189). NGLs and SALMs have similar domain structure and share the ability to bind \nat higher levels in postnatal brains than in embryonic tissue, supporting an important \nrole for NGLs in synapse development. Recent studies have shown that NGL2, ex-\npressed in nonneuronal cells, induces the formation of functional presynaptic termi-\nnals in contacting axons of co-cultured neurons. Moreover, overexpression of NGL2 \nin neurons increases the number of excitatory synapses and clustering of postsynap-\ntic proteins such as PSD-95 and NMDA receptors. These results suggest that NGL2 \nmodulates excitatory synapse development through its association with PSD-95. The \nSALM family includes five members, each contain six LRRs, an Ig domain, and a \nfibronectin III domain, followed by a transmembrane domain and a C-terminal PDZ-\nbinding motif. When overexpressed in neurons, SALMs promote neurite outgrowth,  \n \nand neuronal culture preparation. Despite the fact that SynCAM and neuroligin are \npotent synapse inducers in vitro, neither has been shown to be absolutely required for \nsynapse induction in vivo. Mice lacking SynCAM1 are viable and do not exhibit \nmajor synapse abnormalities. It remains unclear whether synaptogenesis in mice \nlacking SynCAM1 is not altered due to functional compensation by other members \nof the SynCAM family (71). \nPSD-95.

However, unlike \nNGLs, SALMs expression in non-neuronal cells is not sufficient for synapse induc-\ntion. \n4 Other Adhesion Molecules Involved in Synapse Maturation \n4.1 Cadherins, Catenins, and Protocadherins \nMembers of cadherins and protocadherins have been implicated in controlling spe-\ncific stages of synaptogenesis that involve target recognition. Due to their wide ex-\npression in the brain and the existence of multiple isoforms, matching cadherins in \naxons and dendrites is believed to promote selective adhesion between appropriate \npartners. All three major subtypes of cadherins are expressed in the brain: classical \ncadherins, cadherin-related proteins, and protocadherins. The expression and subcel-\nlular distribution of classical cadherins, and their intracellular binding partners, cat-\nenins, varies with neuronal type and developmental stage. This distinct distribution \nof each of these adhesive molecules potentially provides the molecular basis for \nspecificity of synapse connectivity (161). \nAt individual synapses, classical cadherins are detected at pre- and postsynaptic \nsites (9, 95, 178). In development, N-cadherin and β-catenin are localized diffusely \nin motile dendritic filopodia. Upon contact with an axon, the cadherin complex ac-\ncumulates at the tip of filopodia at points of contact (95, 178). Cadherins signal via \ncatenins to regulate dendritic spine morphology and motility. In addition, in vivo \nstudies revealed that the loss of particular catenin molecules results in abnormal \nsynapse formation and/or maturation. Studies using a dominant negative approach \n(N-cadherin lacking ectodomain), demonstrates that blockade of N-cadherin function \nresults in a conversion of mature spines to filopodia-like spines and loss of β-catenin \n(178). These effects are more dramatic in younger neurons, further emphasizing the \nThe cadherin complex mediates profound changes in the actin cytoskeleton \nthrough several effectors including cortactin, Arp1/3, formin-1, and the Rho family \nof GTPases (27, 85).

Interfering with cadherin \nfunction suggests that these molecules are more likely involved in the regulation of \ntarget specificity, rather than induction. For example, initial synaptic assembly is \ndelayed, but not blocked, in neurons that are transfected with dominant-negative \ncadherin (15). Studies in the retinotectal system show that the addition of antibodies \nthat block N-cadherin function causes retinal ganglion cells to overshoot their target \nand form exuberant synapses (92). Thus, evidence indicates that cadherins are \nimportant for target recognition, but they are not essential for synapse differentiation. \nBlocking N-cadherin adhesion causes the formation of widely separated synaptic \nclefts in the chick retinotectal tract (196). Mislocalization of β-catenin, through \ndisruption of its interaction with cadherin, alters synapsin and PSD-95 localization \nand affects presynaptic vesicle release (7, 130). Thus, the recruitment of the \ncadherin-catenin complex appears to modulate maturation of pre- and postsynaptic \nsites."}

Also, \ninteraction between adhesion molecules with the extracellular matrix is believed to \nregulate spine maturation. Two integrin ligands have been demonstrated to affect \ndendritic spines: laminin increases spine density, whereas reelin promotes spine \nstability (61). In addition, the transmembrane proteoglycan syndecan has been shown \nto induce early transformation of filopodia protrusions into mature mushroom-\nshaped spines (60). \nThe large sequence diversity of protocadherins has also led to the suggestion of \ntheir role in target selection and specifying neuronal circuits. About 70 protocadher-\nins are known in mouse and human, and many of these are expressed in the nervous \nsystem in largely overlapping patterns, with some regional and cell-type differences \nin strength of expression (67, 68). Further analysis revealed that protocadherin-γ \nlacking neurons form significantly fewer synapses than wild type neurons (192). \nCorrelating expression pattern of certain protocadherin isoforms, to neuronal subsets \nfor which the pattern of connectivity is known, may help us determine how synapse \nspecificity is controlled. \n4.2 Sidekick \nThe expression pattern and the consequences of its mis-expression on connectivity \nhave also been demonstrated for the adhesion molecule sidekick.

Cells expressing sidekick-1 and -2 form separate aggregates. Deletion \nof the domains required for homophilic association abolishes adhesion. Moreover, \nthe generation of chimeras reverses adhesion specificity (84). Since sidekick is en-\nriched at synapses in narrow sub-laminae of the inner plexiform layer, this suggests \n4.3 Ephrins and Ephrin Receptors \nEphrin receptors (Eph’s) are a large family of 14 receptors and 8 ligands known as \nephrins. Eph receptors and ephrin ligands are expressed through out the developing \nand mature nervous system and were initially characterized based on their ability to \nguide axons to their proper targets, and later determined to be present at synapses \n(20, 66, 179). Eph receptors are divided into two classes: EphA and EphB, which \nbind ephrin A and ephrin B respectively. Ephrins must be clustered to bind and acti-\nvate their cognate receptor (43). EphB receptor tyrosine kinases have been shown to \nregulate excitatory synaptogenesis, including the clustering of NMDARs and AM-\nPARs, dendritic spine formation, and presynaptic differentiation (60, 97).

{"text": "===== Page 18 =====\n190 \nA. El-Husseini \n \n4.4 NCAM and L1-CAM \nThe neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) has been shown to regulate synapse \nmaturation through homo- and heterophilic interactions with recognition molecules \n(21, 40, 48, 50, 51, 133, 149, 160, 171, 174, 183). In particular, NCAM is thought to \nregulate the early events that control contact formation, and fasciculation of axons to \nform bundles, such as the retinotectal and mossy fiber projections (40, 149). NCAM \nis encoded by a single gene located on chromosome 11, and as a result of alternative \nsplicing, is synthesized in three main membrane-bound isoforms (NCAM-120, \nNCAM-140, and NCAM-180) which differ in their C-terminals. NCAM-180 and -\n140 are transmembrane proteins, with different length intracellular domains, whereas \nNCAM-120 is attached to the membrane by a glycosylphosphalitdylinositol (GPI) \nanchor. All three isoforms have a conserved extracellular domain consisting of 5 Ig \ndomains followed by 2 fibronectin type III repeats. All three isoforms of NCAM can \nbe released from primary hippocampal neurons in culture (89). The significance of \nproteolytic processing of membrane-bound NCAM is not well known, however, \nsoluble NCAM forms have been implicated in synaptic plasticity, including long-\nterm potentiation (LTP) (62, 101). Live imaging studies have shown that NCAM \ntranslocates to contact sites within minutes after initial contact formation (174). \nThus, NCAM is potentially involved in early synaptogenesis and in synaptic matura-\ntion. At later stages, the relative levels of post-, but not presynaptic, NCAM expres-\nsion regulates the strength of excitatory synapses in a NMDA receptor-dependent \nmanner (50). This mechanism involves the interaction between the polysialylated \nform of NCAM and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and requires fibroblast growth \nfactor receptor (FGFR)-mediated signaling. The importance of mammalian NCAM \nfor synapse dynamics is further supported by activity-dependent expression of \nNCAM (159) and impaired LTP in mice deficient in NCAM (21, 57, 129). \nThe repertoire of molecules that influence synapse induction and maturation is \ninvolved in glutamatergic and GABAergic synapse development. A survey of 22 \ncadherin family members demonstrated distinct roles for cadherin-11 and cadherin-\n13 in synapse development. This screen also revealed roles for the class 4 Sema-\nphorins, Sema4B and Sema4D, in the development of glutamatergic and GABAergic \nsynapses. Sema4D influences GABAergic, but not glutamatergic synapse develop-\nment. These experiments identify new components that influence the genetic pro-\ngram that regulate synapse formation and/or maintenance. \nL1-CAMs are expressed by almost all post-mitotic neurons in the CNS at the onset \nof differentiation, but not by glia. During development L1-CAM has been shown to \nregulate neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth, fasciculation and guidance, survival, \nand myelination, and some of their roles in the CNS, particularly at synapses, have \nrecently been elucidated.

Dystroglycan \nwas the first identified adhesive macromolecule at mature GABA synapses, cluster-\n115). Dystroglycan is composed of an extracellular α-subunit and a transmembrane \nβ-subunit derived from proteolytic cleavage and glycosylation of a single precursor \nprotein, and binds several extracellular matrix molecules such as agrin, laminin and \nperlecan. In addition, dystroglycan binds to the intracellular proteins, dystrophin and \nutrophin (193). Importantly, dystroglycan also binds to two cell surface proteins \ninvolved in synaptogenesis, namely agrin and β-neurexin (172, 173). Despite the \npotential of dystroglycan as an inhibitory synaptic adhesion protein, studies on neu-\nrons obtained from mice mutant for dystroglycan indicate that this protein is not \nessential, since clustering of many proteins that localize to inhibitory synapses is not \naffected in these mice (115). These findings suggest that dystroglycans may play a \nmore prominent role in the maturation of inhibitory contacts. \nA clue for one of the functions of L1-CAM in inhibitory synapse development \ncomes from a study on a member of the family known as neurofascin186 (3). The \nprecise localization of neurofascin186 by the membrane adaptor protein ankyrin G is \nresponsible for establishment of a gradient of this adhesion molecule at the initial \naxon segment of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Disruption of this gradient results in dis-\nruption of the subcellular localization of GABAergic synapses on the axonal initial \nsegment (3). These data suggest that L1 may be important in directing formation of \ninhibitory synapses to specific sites on the target neurons. Protocadherins also appear \nto be important for inhibitory synapse development in the spinal cord. Spinal cord \nneurons prepared from protocadherin mutant mice show a decrease in the number of \nGABAergic terminals. Moreover, electrophysiological recordings revealed a de-\ncrease in both spontaneous and evoked inhibitory currents (192). Whether protocad-\nherins are important for inhibitory synapse development in other areas of the brain \nremains to be explored. \n6 Role for Adhesion Molecules in Synaptic Plasticity \nExpression of many adhesion molecules persists into adulthood, and as such, these \nmolecules are thought to play a role in the activity-dependent remodeling of synaptic \ncontacts, a process associated with learning and memory paradigms.

Blocking integrin function in the adult rat \nhippocampus with an RGD sequence peptide, which interferes with integrin binding \nto its endogenous ligands in the extracellular matrix, causes a decay of LTP, an en-\nduring enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission (170, 195). Furthermore, \nchronic blockade by RGD peptides or by functional antibodies against the β3 in-\ntegrin subunit prevents activity-dependent reduction in the probability of glutamate \nrelease (29). Members of the Ig superfamily, in particular NCAM and L1, also con-\ntrol synaptic plasticity. Antibodies against L1 or NCAM infused into the hippocam-\npus of rats decreases efficiency of spatial learning tasks such as the Morris water \nmaze (4). L1 knockout mice show similar learning impairments (96). In vitro, L1 \nantibodies and soluble oligomannosides that disrupt interaction with NCAM, signifi-\ncantly reduce LTP induced by theta-burst stimulation (123). \nSeveral adhesion complexes regulate retrograde signaling between pre- and \npostsynaptic compartments. The EphB-ephrinB receptor-ligand pair is of particular \ninterest due to its capacity for bidirectional signaling (66), which is thought to coor-\ndinate changes in both sides of the synapse during LTP. On the postsynaptic mem-\nbrane, addition of ephrinB induces interaction between EphB and NMDA-type glu-\ntamate receptors, an increase in NMDA-mediated calcium influx and gene \nexpression (41, 176). Disruption of Eph/ephrin signaling by interfering peptides \ninhibits retrograde signaling through ephrinB, blocking LTP at mossy fibers in the \ncerebellum (37). Thus, multiple adhesion systems exist to modulate communication \n7 Conclusions and Future Directions \nNumerous studies indicate that several of the recently identified adhesion molecules \ncan modulate synaptic contact number, morphology and function. However, strong \nevidence that any of these molecules are indispensable for synapse formation in vivo \nis lacking, suggesting functional redundancy. Thus, one can envisage that synapse \nformation and maturation rely on the collective action of these adhesive systems. \nMost likely, crosstalk between the different adhesive systems ensures proper connec-\ntivity and recruitment of appropriate neurotransmitter receptors and associated pro-\ntein complexes. Whether these adhesion molecules act in parallel or in a hierarchical \nmanner remains unknown. Future studies are needed to determine how these various \nadhesion systems orchestrate the establishment and function of synapses. Time-lapse \nimaging studies monitoring the behavior of several molecules implicated in synapse \ndevelopment will help address some of these issues.

Both LTP and LTD have been reported at inhibitory synapses in a variety of \nbrain regions, including the hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum and brain stem (24, 25, \n73, 81). However, it remains to be determined whether changes in plasticity of in-\nhibitory synapses are controlled by similar mechanisms that involve retrograde sig-\nnaling through adhesive complexes."}

Ehlers \nHoward Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Neurobiology, Duke University Medical\nCenter, Durham, NC 27710, USA, ehlers@neuro.duke.edu \n \nAbstract. The development, maintenance, and plasticity of synapses require the trafficking of \nmolecular components to postsynaptic specializations distributed across elaborate dendritic \narbors. The large size and geometric complexity of dendrites necessitate specialized mecha-\nnisms that can both deliver postsynaptic cargo over extended distances and regulate dendritic \ncomposition on a submicron scale. Despite the fundamental importance of membrane traffick-\ning in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity, the cellular rules governing postsynaptic \ntrafficking are only now emerging. We review here current knowledge on the organization of \ndendritic organelles, and describe cell biological mechanisms that allow long-range transport \nof postsynaptic components that are then locally processed at individual synapses. \n1 Introduction \nWhile inhibitory synapses are typically localized on the dendritic shaft (190), \nmost excitatory synapses in the brain are localized on micron-sized membranous \nprotrusions present along the entire length of dendrites (85). These dendritic spines \ncontact one or more presynaptic terminals, and the sites of contact contain a dense \narray of receptors, scaffold proteins, and signaling molecules at the postsynaptic \ndensity (PSD) (96).

{"text": "===== Page 6 =====\n210 \nC. Hanus and M.D. Ehlers \nIn addition to a role as a Ca2+ reservoir important for postsynaptic signaling \n(236), spine SER may also be involved in lipid and protein secretion to the spine \nsurface. A specialized SER-like derivative composed of stacked cisternae, termed the \nspine apparatus, is found in some dendritic spines (Fig. 2a) (84–86, 268). The pres-\nence of vesicles near the tip of the spine apparatus raises the possibility that it could \nsupply membrane for spine growth, and possibly traffic important synaptic proteins, \nsuch as AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors, which can be localized to this or-\nganelle (200, 227, 268). Though defined largely on morphological criteria, the pre-\ncise compartmental identity of the spine apparatus has yet to be determined. Notably, \nthe spine apparatus is absent in mice lacking synaptopodin (55). These mice display \ndeficits in LTP and spatial learning, indicating a potential link between the spine \napparatus and mechanisms of synaptic plasticity (55). \nThe organization of the GA in neurons is quite different from what is observed in \nmost non-neuronal cells. Immunofluorescence labeling shows that the neuronal GA \nconsists not only of the perinuclear membrane array found in most cell types, but \nalso of discrete structures dispersed in dendrites, termed Golgi outposts (Fig. 2b) (52, \n75, 105, 108, 168, 285). This organization has been confirmed by EM, where minia-\nture Golgi-stacks and intracellular membranes immuno-reactive for Golgi mem-\nbranes markers such as α-mannosidase II, giantin, GM130, and Rab6, have been \nobserved in dendrites (75, 108, 220). Dendritic Golgi membranes can be found close \nto synapses but seem to be only localized to the dendritic shaft. Moreover, not all \ndendrites contain morphological or molecular markers of the GA (108), suggesting \ndendrite-specific compartmentalization of secretory trafficking. \nThe dendritic localization of RER, ERES and Golgi membranes suggests that \n“satellite” secretory systems exist in some dendrites that could locally synthesize and \nprocess secretory proteins at sites remote from the cell body. Numerous mRNA \nspecies are found in dendrites, including mRNAs encoding postsynaptic receptors \nsuch as NMDA receptors, AMPA receptors and glycine receptors (272). Although \nthe local translation of membrane proteins in dendrites is still not as clearly deline-\nated as that of cytoplasmic proteins, protein synthesis and enzymatic activities asso-\nciated with the secretory pathway, such as glycosylation, persist in hippocampal \ndendrites isolated from the soma (284, 285). The capacity of isolated dendrites to \nIn addition to its function in lipid biogenesis (21), the SER plays a crucial role in \nneuronal calcium homeostasis. The SER sequesters calcium by the action of the ER-\nassociated Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) and releases it in the cytoplasm upon activation of \ninositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) or ryanodine receptors (236, 240). The den-\ndritic SER often extends into the neck of mature spines, providing a conduit to the \nsynapse (Fig. 2a). \nSpine SER membranes occasionally extend to the periphery of the PSD (288). \nThis tight association of intracellular calcium stores and the PSD may depend on the \ndirect binding of inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) in the ER to the postsynap-\ntic scaffold molecule Homer (242). SER membranes are absent from Purkinje neuron \nspines in dilute mice, which lack functional myosin Va (276). Parallel fiber synapses \nonto Purkine neurons in dilute mice have impaired long-term depression, supporting \na requirement of spine SER calcium in cerebellar LTD (188)."}
{"text": "===== Page 7 =====\nDendritic Organelles for Postsynaptic Trafficking\n211\nThe involvement of dendritic Golgi ouposts in post-ER membrane trafficking \nwas recently established by imaging hippocampal neurons expressing the ts045 \nthermosensitive mutant of the vesicular stomatitis viral glycoprotein (VSVG-ts) \n(105). VSVG-ts is retained in the ER at 39.5°C, but is rapidly released by reducing \nthe temperature to 32°C, allowing control and monitoring of the synchronous pro-\ngression of cargo through the secretory pathway (16). Upon release from the ER, a \nfraction of pre-Golgi carriers containing VSVG-ts merge with dendritic compart-\nments immunoreactive for the Golgi markers galactosyltransferase and GM130, \ndemonstrating that dendritic Golgi outposts are functional trafficking platforms \n(105). Golgi outposts also engage in the local dendritic trafficking of BDNF, con-\nfirming their role in processing endogenous proteins (105). The neural cell adhesion \nmolecule (NCAM) promotes the accumulation of TGN-derived vesicles at neuron \ncontact sites (275), indicating that post-Golgi compartments can be directed by inter-\ncellular signaling. \nAlthough dendritic Golgi outposts are present in some dendrites of hippocampal \nand cortical neurons, not all neurons possess detectable dendritic Golgi membranes \n(105, 108). Moreover, even in those dendrites containing Golgi outposts, the major-\nity of ER-to-Golgi carriers originating in the dendrite are trafficked all the way back \nto the somatic Golgi in the cell body (105). Thus, dual modes of early secretory \ntrafficking exist in dendrites. The major mode of ER-to-Golgi trafficking is directed \nlong distances to the somatic Golgi apparatus and likely represents the exclusive \nmode of early secretory trafficking in those dendrites lacking Golgi outposts. A sec-\nond mode of ER-to-Golgi trafficking occurs locally in dendrites containing Golgi \noutposts, and may be specialized for the processing of specific cargo or the control of \ndendritic secretion. \n2.2 Dendritic Endosomes \nSpines or dendritic segments need to regulate the surface expression of neurotrans-\nmitter receptors, adhesion molecules, and ion channels. Often separated by only a \nfew microns, adjacent spines on a dendrite can have strikingly different steady-state \nlevels of synaptic proteins (13, 64, 95, 183), requiring different rates of insertion, \nremoval, and subsequent recycling. The endosomal system provides a primary \nmechanism for highly localized regulation of spine membrane composition. \nThe endosomal system is an interconnected and dynamic network of membrane \nbound structures that receive endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). \nNewly internalized vesicles formed by means of clathrin-dependent or clathrin-\nindependent endocytosis fuse to form early/sorting endosomes (185). In much the \nsynthesize exogenously expressed integral membrane proteins (e.g., glutamate recep-\ntors) and deliver them to the plasma membrane has been reported (127, 128). \nInterestingly, at 20°C, a temperature which blocks vesicle budding from the TGN \n(181), newly released VSVG-ts frequently accumulates at Golgi outposts located at \ndendritic branch points (Fig. 2b) (105). These outposts engage in ongoing post-Golgi \ntrafficking after release from TGN-exit blockade (105), and appear ideally positioned \nto regulate the identity or quantity of cargo that is trafficked to each branch, a possi-\nbility that awaits further investigation."}
{"text": "===== Page 8 =====\n212 \nC. Hanus and M.D. Ehlers \nThe observation of an intracellular accumulation of various plasma proteins in \nPurkinje neuron dendrites was some of the first evidence for dendritic endocytosis \n(72). As shown by immunofluorescent labeling of a broad cast of endosome associ-\nated proteins, virtually all elements of the endosomal network are present in hippo-\ncampal neurons dendrites, including early endosomes, recycling endosomes, late \nendosomes, and lysosomes (17, 63), although spatial variations in endosome abun-\ndance in different dendrites or different neuronal classes has not been thoroughly \ninvestigated. \nBy combining three-dimensional electron microscopy reconstruction of dendrites \nin vivo with the tracking of internalized gold-conjugated endocytic cargo in acute \nhippocampal slices, Harris and colleagues have provided important insight into the \nfundamental organization of the dendritic endosomal network (47). Internal en-\ndosomal structures are present in dendrites, including coated and uncoated vesicles, \ntubular structures and multi-vesicular bodies (Fig. 3a) (47). Interestingly, nearly two \nthirds of dendritic endosomal structures are situated within or at the base of spines \n(213), suggesting a direct involvement in subsynaptic membrane trafficking. En-\ndosome-like structures generally extend over stretches of dendrite encompassing one \nto three spines, suggesting that multiple spines share the same endocytic organelles \n(47). Clathrin-like coats are present at the tip of some tubular protrusions emerging \nfrom these structures, indicating that they may generate smaller trafficking interme-\ndiates within the dendritic endosomal pathway (47). \nOther studies showed that syntaxin 13, a SNARE protein enriched in early and \nrecycling endosomes, is found in dendritic tubulo-vesicular structures containing \ntransferrin receptors, which are known to be recycled through the endosomal path-\nway (225). Consistent with local endosomal trafficking, the transferrin receptor con-\ntinuously cycles back and forth between the dendritic surface and internal structures \n \nsame way that the TGN functions for secretory proteins, sorting endosomes act as a \nstation from which internalized cargo can be targeted for degradation, transport to \nthe TGN, or recycling back to the cell surface, either directly or via recycling en-\ndosomes (Fig. 1) (19). Sorting endosomes display a characteristic tubulo-vesicular \nmorphology directly related to their function. Molecules destined for reinsertion into \nthe plasma membrane or to the TGN exit the sorting endosome on vesicles pinched \noff from small-diameter tubules (19). Cargo targeted for degradation remains in \nsorting endosomes which become progressively more acidic as they mature into late \nendosomes, with degradative cargo budding intraluminally to form multivesicular \nbodies (MVBs) prior to fusion with lysosomes where cargo degradation is completed \nwithin minutes (185). Endocytic organelles exhibit a complex morphological organi-\nzation in the form of membrane vacuoles, cisternae, tubules, and multilamellar or \nmultivesicular bodies, and differ in their biochemical composition and localization \nwithin the cell. In most non-neuronal cells, early endosomes are localized close to \nthe cell periphery while recycling endosomes (REs) are generally found in the  \nperi-centriolar area (Fig. 1) (185). This spatial segregation is likely crucial for the \nsequential processing of molecules as they progress from one compartment to the \nother (187). In neurons however, both early and REs are localized in dendrites re-\nmote from cell body, potentially facilitating local processing of internalized cargo \n(63)."}

Interestingly, both measurements of transferrin uptake and immu-\nnolabeling of hippocampal neuron dendrites indicate that REs are often localized at \nthe base of the spine neck and occasionally in the spine head (Fig. 3b,c) (212, 213). \nNotably, REs translocate into spines upon LTP-inducing stimuli where they contrib-\nute exocytic membrane for spine growth during synapse potentiation (213).

{"text": "===== Page 10 =====\n214 \nC. Hanus and M.D. Ehlers \n \n2.3 Dendritic Mitochondria \nSynaptic remodeling requires membrane fission, fusion, protein degradation and local \nprotein synthesis, all of which are ATP-dependent processes. Indeed mitochondria, \nstrongly impregnated by common contrast agents used in electron microscopy, were \none of the first dendritic organelles to be identified (217). Dendrite mitochondria are \nmainly located in the dendritic shaft, but can occasionally be found associated with \nspines (1, 31). Although dendritic mitochondria usually appear as individual units, \nthree-dimensional EM reconstructions have documented the existence of continuous \nmitochondrial networks extending over 10–30 μm in dendrites of the CA1 region of \nrodent hippocampus (222). \nDendritic mitochondria are quite dynamic. In addition to fusion and fission, mi-\ntochondria can move over long distances in dendrites in an activity-dependent man-\nner (161). Synaptic stimulation decreases the mobility of mitochondria and induces \ntheir translocation into spines (161). Decreased mitochondrial mobility near active \nsynapses and increased mobility in the absence of neural activity would be predicted \nto distribute mitochondria near highly active, high ATP-utilizing, dendritic regions. \nConsistent with this notion, reducing the number of dendritic mitochondria by domi-\nnant-negative overexpression of the GTPase Drp1, a dynamin-like protein involved \nin mitochondrial fission, decreased the number of synapses. Conversely, increasing \nthe number of dendritic mitochondria by overexpressing wild type Drp1 or increas-\ning mitochondrial function by treating cells with creatine, nearly doubled synapse \nnumber, demonstrating that synapse formation or maintenance is normally limited by \nmitochondrial activity (161). \n3 Polarized Trafficking and Long-Range Targeting to Synapses \nThe maintenance of synaptic structures with distinct compositions and properties \nrequires continuous and accurate targeting of newly synthesized proteins to their \nfinal destination. Like any polarized cell, but amplified due to their morphological \ncomplexity, neurons require sorting and targeting mechanisms to ensure the delivery \nof molecular components to the appropriate compartment. Cell compartmentalization \nis often most obvious at the plasma membrane where diffusion barriers prevent inte-\ngral proteins from being freely exchanged from one compartment to another. In \nneurons, such barriers are present at the axon initial segment, preventing mixing of \ncomponents of the axonal and somatodendritic membranes (145, 197, 301, 302). On \na finer (and possibly more impressive) scale, the thousands of synaptic inputs that a \ngiven neuron receives further segment the somatodendritic membrane into an array \nof postsynaptic microdomains, each with specific compositions. This raises funda-\nmental questions on how such an extreme degree of compartmentalization can be \nmaintained."}
{"text": "===== Page 11 =====\nDendritic Organelles for Postsynaptic Trafficking\n215\n \n3.1 Asymmetric Protein Trafficking in Neurons \nMuch of what is known about protein trafficking in polarized cells comes from stud-\nies in epithelial cells, most prominently the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) \ncell-line, which differentiates in vitro into mono-layered epithelia with a well-\ndefined apical/basolateral asymmetry (235). Various modes of polarized trafficking \nhave been described in this system, including selective sorting of cargo into special-\nized post-Golgi carriers directly targeted to specific cellular domains, and non-\nspecific delivery to the plasma membrane followed by endocytosis and transport to \nthe appropriate destination (235, 289). \nStudies in MDCK cells have demonstrated that cargo sorting into distinct post-\nGolgi carriers relies on intrinsic sequence determinants, with basolateral sorting \nsequences generally located in the cytoplasmic tail, and apical sorting sequences \nfound frequently in the transmembrane domain (134, 235). Sorting into apical carri-\ners can also result from post-translational modifications, such as N- or O- glycosyla-\ntion, or addition of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (235). When ex-\npressed in neurons, several basolateral and apical proteins are sorted preferentially to \nthe somatodendritic compartment and axon respectively, including VSVG and LDL \nreceptor (basolateral/somatodendritic), and influenza HA protein (apical/axonal) (60, \n61, 123). However, more recent experiments suggest that neurons do not recognize \nsome dihydrophobic motifs directing cargo to the basolateral domain in epithelial \ncells (260). Additionally, the sequence determinant that directs transferrin receptor to \nthe basolateral domain in epithelial cells overlaps only partially with the somatoden-\ndritic targeting motif (300). Therefore, while many of the general principles of pro-\ntein sorting established in epithelial cells apply to neurons, neurons have many of \ntheir own rules for establishing protein asymmetry. \nIn addition to direct delivery of proteins to their final membrane destination, a \nmore circuitous mode of polarized trafficking is observed in certain epithelial and \nendothelial cells, where cargo destined for the apical plasma membrane is first exo-\ncytosed to the basolateral membrane and then endocytosed and transported to the \napical membrane (289). Such transcytosis is also observed in neurons and accounts \nfor the trafficking of certain proteins (e.g. VAMP2 and NgCAM/L1), which are \ninitially delivered to the somatodendritic surface but ultimately localize to the pre-\nsynaptic terminal or axonal membrane (243, 303). Mutations disrupting VAMP2 \ninternalization leave VAMP2 stranded at the somatodendritic surface, indicating that \nits proper localization requires a redistribution occurring after endocytosis. While \nNgCAM is enriched in the axonal plasma membrane, intracellular NgCAM contain-\ning vesicles are found in both dendrites and axons (30), indicating that the steady \nstate distribution of the molecule does not result from a vectorial targeting of post-\nGolgi carriers. Monitoring NgCAM insertion in the cell-surface following a syn-\nchronous release from the ER revealed that this protein first appears at the somato-\ndendritic plasma membrane, and is subsequently internalized to be trafficked to the \naxon (243, 303). Interestingly, a single tyrosine point mutation (Y33A) results in \ndirect axonal targeting of NgCAM (303), demonstrating that NgCAM can follow \ndifferent routes to reach the same final destination. The direct targeting to the axon \nthus likely represents a default route for some axonal integral proteins."}
{"text": "===== Page 12 =====\n216 \nC. Hanus and M.D. Ehlers \n \nAnother example of polarized trafficking is neuronal potassium channels. Neu-\nrons express a wide array of potassium channels, which regulate crucial aspects of \ncellular ion homeostasis and excitability. Although displaying very similar primary \nstructures within particular subclasses, given channel isoforms can have distinct \ndistribution in the neuronal plasma membrane as well as specific trafficking itinerar-\nies (101, 171). For example, while voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels Kv1.2, \nKv1.3 and Kv1.4 are primarily found in the axonal plasma membrane, Kv4.2 is se-\nlectively expressed at the somato-dendritic surface (256). The conserved structure \nand specific surface expression patterns of Kv channels allowed the identification of \nmolecular determinants of asymmetric protein trafficking in neurons. Analysis of \nchimeric molecules led to the identification of a C-terminal 16 amino acid di-leucine \nmotif required for the proper targeting of Kv4.2 and sufficient to target the axonally \nlocalized channels Kv1.3 and Kv1.4 to dendrites (233). Conversely, interaction of \nthe cytoplasmic N-terminal T1 tetramerization domain of Kv1 channels with Kvβ \nsubunits is required for Kv1 expression at the axonal membrane and is sufficient to \ntarget dendritic molecules such as the transferrin receptor to the axonal surface (91). \nSimilar approaches led to the characterization of the molecular address targeting \nthe AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit to the somatodendritic compartment. This deter-\nminant resides in the proximal segment of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of GluR1 \nand is sufficient to redirect otherwise axonally expressed proteins such as influenza \nvirus hemagglutinin to the somatodendritic membrane (239). \n3.2 Polarized Secretory Trafficking for Asymmetric Dendrite Outgrowth \nIn addition to membrane protein processing, the ER and the Golgi are the primary \nsite of lipid biosynthesis (163), a metabolic function subject to considerable chal-\nlenge during the massive expansion of the plasma membrane that occurs during \nneurite outgrowth. Consistent with an immediate requirement for membrane traffick-\ning through the secretory pathway in dendrite growth, disrupting Golgi function with \nbrefeldin A in developing hippocampal or cortical pyramidal neurons dramatically \nreduces dendritic growth and branching (108). Perhaps more surprisingly, in mature \ncortical pyramidal neurons the same treatment causes a dramatic simplification of \ndendrite morphology, demonstrating the importance of an ongoing membrane flux \nthrough the secretory pathway for the maintenance of dendritic arbors (108). \nThe site of membrane insertion in growing dendrites is uncertain, but the spatial \norganization of the neuronal secretory pathway provides some clues. Somatic Golgi \nis nearly always oriented toward the apical dendrite in hippocampal pyramidal cells \nin vivo, and toward the longest and most branched dendrite of hippocampal neurons \nFinally, of particular interest is the tendency of certain receptors and ion channels \nto have unusual reverse gradient concentration along dendrites, with distal dendrites \ndisplaying a higher concentration of receptors/channels than proximal ones. This is \nnotably the case of AMPA receptors (7, 262) and HCN1 channels (167), whose  \ndistance-dependent enrichment along apical dendrites is important for the scaling of \ndendritic currents and their integration in the soma of hippocampal pyramidal neu-\nrons (73). This suggests differential regulation of protein trafficking or stability as a \nfunction of dendritic distance, a possibility that still awaits further investigation."}
{"text": "===== Page 13 =====\nDendritic Organelles for Postsynaptic Trafficking\n217\n \nin culture (Fig. 2b) (108). As a consequence, most post-Golgi flux originating from \nthe somatic Golgi is directed toward the apical dendrite. Disrupting the polarization \nof the somatic Golgi by overexpressing GRASP65, a Golgi matrix protein required \nfor cisternal stacking (6), blocks the specification of the apical dendrite without di-\nminishing the overall rate and extent of total dendrite growth (108), demonstrating \nthat polarized post-Golgi trafficking sustains asymmetric dendritic growth. \nIn another study, the centrosome and associated organelles were found to cluster \nat sites opposite of the plane of final mitotic division of neural progenitors at a loca-\ntion where the first neurite emerges and becomes the axon (51). However, at slightly \nlater developmental stages after initial neurite outgrowth but before either polarized \ngrowth or the appearance of spatially restricted axonal markers (hippocampal neuron \npolarity stage 1 in the scheme of Banker) (62), the somatic Golgi shows no polariza-\ntion towards the axon (108). One possibility is that post-Golgi trafficking is redi-\nrected from axons to dendrites at different developmental stages, during migration, \nor in different in vivo contexts. Interestingly, disrupting the secretory pathway by \noverexpressing a kinase-dead form of protein kinase D1 that prevents cargo budding \nfrom the TGN (14), results in cessation of dendritic growth while axonal growth \npersists over days (108), indicating that distinct mechanisms govern membrane addi-\ntion to the growing axon. Thus, akin to what occurs during polarization of non-\nneuronal cell architecture (69, 148), reorganization of the secretory pathway is essen-\ntial for the asymmetric growth of dendrites. In this context, it is interesting to note \nthat several molecules implicated in neurite polarization and outgrowth, such as \nPI3K, LIMK1, and Cdk5, are localized to the Golgi apparatus (6, 208, 238), suggest-\ning close coordination between dendritic compartmentalization, polarized cell \ngrowth, and directed membrane trafficking through the neuronal Golgi. \n3.3 Microtubule Transport \nThe cytoskeleton provides anchoring points for the stabilization and transport of \ncellular structures, and is a major determinant of cell architecture. The microtubule \nnetwork provides tracks along which cargo including organelles, vesicles, and \nmRNA granules is transported over long distances. In some instances, stabilization \nof microtubule plus ends allows direct vectorial delivery of cargo to subcompart-\nments of the plasma membrane, as observed for the targeting of gap junction compo-\nnents to epithelial cell adherens junctions (255). In a comparable manner, the estab-\nlishment of a subsynaptic secretory pathway at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) or \nin Torpedo electrocytes also involves a local reorganization of microtubules (33, \n124–126, 229). \nThe organization of neuronal microtubules presents interesting specializations. In \nmodel non-neuronal cell types, most microtubules share the same polarity and are \narranged in a radial manner with their minus end anchored at the microtubule orga-\nnizing center (MTOC) and their plus end radiating towards the cell periphery (280). \nIn contrast, neuronal microtubules in proximal dendrites adopt both plus end-out and \nplus end-in orientations while axons and distal dendrites contain microtubules with \ntheir plus ends pointing away from the cell body (12). Although the bidirectional"}
{"text": "===== Page 14 =====\n218 \nC. Hanus and M.D. Ehlers \n \norganization of microtubules predicts significant complexity for dendritic membrane \ntrafficking, the precise physiological consequences remain largely unknown. \nActive movement of cargo along microtubules requires two classes of motor pro-\nteins – the large family of kinesins and cytoplasmic dynein. These microtubule mo-\ntors move, in most cases, towards the plus and minus ends of microtubules, respec-\ntively (293). Indeed, the first kinesin to be described was characterized as the \nmolecular motor responsible for fast axonal transport (23, 294). Subsequently, at \nleast 45 members of the kinesin family have been discovered in mammals (102). \nSome of these kinesins play distinct roles in dendrites. For example, KIFC2 and \nKIF5 (the conventional kinesin, also known as kinesin1), localize to the somatoden-\ndritic compartment, where they are required for trafficking multivesicular bodies and \nmRNA granules (137, 241). \nIn a recent study, Banker and colleagues showed that the behavior of specific \nkinesins changes during early stages of neuronal morphogenesis. Whereas truncated \nkinesin 3 accumulates at the tip of all neurites throughout development, truncated \nkinesin 1 localizes to only a subset of neurites and rapidly redistributes in the emerg-\ning axon (119). This event represents one of the earliest molecular readouts of axon \nspecification, and demonstrates that neurite differentiation involves a tight control of \nthe microtubule network and associated kinesin-based transport. \n3.4 Synaptic Targeting: Postsynaptic Receptors as Model Cargo \nPostsynaptic receptors are highly enriched at synapses, where they form microdo-\nmains apposed to presynaptic active zones releasing cognate neurotransmitters. This \naccumulation depends on postsynaptic scaffolds, which stabilize receptors and con-\nnect them to downstream signaling effectors (see Chapter by Kennedy et al., this \nvolume). Time-lapse imaging and photobleaching of GFP-tagged receptors (10, 11, \n147, 254, 258) as well as real-time imaging of single fluorescent probes bound to \nIn the last ten years, biochemical characterization established that postsynaptic \nreceptors are found with their interacting partners in large protein complexes con-\ntaining an unexpectedly broad cast of molecular motors, especially kinesins, indicat-\ning that receptor microtubule transport is a fundamental aspect of postsynaptic recep-\ntor biology (138). This notion has been directly demonstrated for KIF17 which is \nrequired for the delivery of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors to synapses (92, \n251). Interestingly, interaction with different cargo can “steer” kinesins to specific \ncellular domains. For example, the glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1), \nwhich binds the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2, directs KIF5 primarily to the soma-\ntodendritic domain, while a different kinesin binding protein, JSAP1, routes KIF5 to \nthe axon (252). In addition to participating in AMPA receptor trafficking, the \nGRIP1/KIF5 interaction has important functions in dendrite development and main-\ntenance. Decreasing GRIP1 expression by RNA interference (RNAi) causes a loss of \ndendrites which can be rescued by overexpression of EphB2 (104), a receptor tyro-\nsine kinase known to affect spine development and synaptic plasticity (117). Con-\nversely, disrupting the GRIP1/KIF5 interaction impairs EphB2 trafficking to den-\ndrites and inhibits dendritic growth, supporting a model where GRIP1 acts as a \nkinesin adaptor important for dendritic trafficking (104, 252)."}

These latter experimental approaches highlight the \nhighly dynamic and probabilistic nature of receptor stabilization at synapses, empha-\nsizing the importance of lateral diffusion (287). Indeed, upon expressing recombi-\nnant glycine receptor subunits under conditions where receptor exocytosis was de-\ntected only in the soma, it was found that lateral diffusion is sufficient for receptor \naccumulation at synapses on distal dendrites (237). \nThe relative contribution of vesicular trafficking and lateral diffusion to the traf-\nficking of postsynaptic receptors remains a topic of active investigation. In some \ninstances, both modes of trafficking have been found to contribute for a given recep-\ntor or membrane cargo. For example, while immunogold labeling and biochemical \ndata suggest that microtubule dependent transport is a major mode of NMDA recep-\ntor targeting to synapses, live cell imaging indicates that synapses either receive \nquantal “packets” of NMDA receptors (299), or can gradually acquire NMDA recep-\ntors (25). While the latter study supports a “diffusional” accumulation of NMDA \nreceptors, the former supports a direct delivery by discrete intracellular carriers. \nMonitoring the recovery of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents following \nirreversible inactivation with the open-channel blocker MK801 demonstrated that \nsynaptic NMDA receptors exchange with their extrasynaptic counterparts (286). \nComparable approaches applied to GABAA receptors (281) and AMPA receptors (2) \nsupport the same general conclusion. \nIn the case of AMPA receptors, local activity at single synapses reduces the lat-\neral mobility of GluR1, leading to accumulation of receptors by a diffusional trap \n(64), while local exocytosis from recycling endosomes supplies receptors for LTP \n(147, 212). Exocytosis and lateral diffusion are thus likely subject to distinct forms \nof regulation for different classes of receptors and membrane cargo (38, 203). Rec-\nonciliation of these two modes of synaptic trafficking (lateral diffusion versus vecto-\nrial vesicular targeting) awaits further investigation. Yet, the architecture of the den-\ndritic membrane provides some interesting clues. \nMost central excitatory synapses are localized on dendritic spines, and are thus \nisolated from the dendrite proper by the narrow spine neck, which limits exchange \nof cytoplasmic and integral membrane proteins between the spine head and the \ndendritic shaft (10, 11, 18, 232). Local diffusible pools of membrane cargo inside \nspines would thus provide a reserve pool for synaptic exchange (103). Utilization \nof vesicular traffic locally within spines, in turn, requires the positioning or mobi-\nlization of vesicle budding and trafficking machinery. The combination of a lim-\nited local pool of reserve cargo together with spine-localized membrane trafficking \nAlthough lateral diffusion in the plasma membrane is a major aspect of receptor \nmovement and exchange, endocytosis and exocytosis are also crucial for rapid varia-\ntions of receptor amount at synapses (see Chapters by Esteban, Wenthold et al., \nLorena Arancibia-Carcamo et al., and Lisman and Hell, this volume). However, if \nexo- and endocytosis can occur locally in close proximity to excitatory synapses, \nmembrane fusion and budding have not been demonstrated directly at the PSD (see \nSection 4 below), implying that lateral diffusion is an obligatory step for receptors to \nenter or exit synapses (287)."}

On the \nother hand, synapses onto dendritic shafts, including most GABAergic synapses, \nhave direct access to a much larger surface pool of extrasynaptic receptors and are \nlikely less affected by short term changes in the balance between exo- and endocy-\ntosis. Such constraints of geometry might help explain the distinct mechanisms for \ntargeting and maintaining postsynaptic membrane components at excitatory spine \nsynapses versus inhibitory shaft synapses (see Chapter by Lorena Arancibia-\nCarcamo et al., this volume). \n3.5 Pre-assembly of Postsynaptic Membranes in the Secretory Pathway \nThe function of the ER and the Golgi apparatus in membrane trafficking extends \nbeyond transmembrane protein processing. These organelles also direct the traffick-\ning of cytoplasmic proteins modified by acylation. Indeed, acyltransferases, the core \nenzymes mediating protein palmitoylation localize to the Golgi apparatus (231, 263). \nThe addition of a lipid moiety to proteins increases their hydrophobicity and facili-\ntates their incorporation in lipid rafts (263), which participate in the nano-\norganization of cellular membranes by stabilizing multi-protein complexes (57, 115). \nInterestingly, numerous synaptic proteins, including cytoplasmic molecules, are \npalmitoylated. As shown directly for GRIP, PSD-95, AMPA receptors (GluR1-\nGluR4), ACh receptors, and GABAA receptors, palmitoylation regulates synaptic \ntargeting and stabilization (56, 66, 67, 71, 97). PSD-95, the major postsynaptic scaf-\nfold protein at glutamateric synapses, is palmitoylated by HIP14, while specific \nAMPA receptor and GABAA receptor subunits are palmitoylated by GODZ, two \npalmitoylating enzymes primarily localized to the Golgi (71, 74, 113, 133, 230, 261). \nAs described at central synapses (56, 66, 67, 94, 172, 245), and in Torpedo \nelectrocytes (175, 176), several postsynaptic scaffold proteins are localized to \nintracellular membranes containing receptors that likely correspond to compart-\nments of the secretory pathway. Live cell imaging experiments have revealed the \nappearance and transport of PSD scaffold proteins such as PSD-95 as discrete \nclusters in dendrites (78, 177, 204). In the case of PSD-95, dendritic transport \noccurs through the secretory pathway (66) and can be stimulated by BDNF (307). \nThe origin of these “pre-packaged” secretory carriers and the adaptor molecules or \ncoat proteins involved in cargo sorting from earlier stages in the secretory pathway \nare not yet clear. However, many of these transported scaffold proteins are lipid \nmodified, suggesting that acylation at the Golgi apparatus is an important step in \nscaffold protein targeting, and may direct the pre-assembly of postsynaptic mem-\nbranes in the secretory patway. PSD95 is particularly interesting in this regard \nsince its palmitoylation is regulated by synaptic activity (67), and is essential for \nits co-trafficking with AMPA receptors (66), its targeting to synapses (49, 66), and \nits ability to cluster transmembrane proteins (41)."}
{"text": "===== Page 17 =====\nDendritic Organelles for Postsynaptic Trafficking\n221\n \n4 Local Trafficking of Postsynaptic Components \n4.1 Dendritic Exocytosis \n4.1.1 Regulated Exocytosis Near the Postsynaptic Membrane  \nMembrane fusion requires the concerted action of numerous factors to first tether a \nvesicle to the membrane, prime it for release, and finally to fuse the separate lipid \nbilayers into a contiguous membrane (120). The eukaryotic membrane fusion ma-\nchinery has been conserved during evolution, and consists of a core complex of the \nsoluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) \nfamily of proteins. As elucidated in detail for exocytosis in presynaptic nerve termi-\nnals (see Chapter by Atasoy and Kavalali, this volume), vesicle-bound SNARES (v-\nSNARES) form a complex with target membrane associated SNARES (t-SNARES) \nthrough coiled-coil motifs in a process facilitated by members of the Rab family of \nsmall GTPases (120). Accessory proteins superimposed on this core machinery allow \nfor regulation of exocytosis by coupling membrane fusion to diverse signaling path-\nways. Many of the principles governing regulated exocytosis have been established \nby studies on the Ca2+-dependent release of synaptic vesicles (see Chapter by Atasoy \nand Kavalali, this volume). \nAlthough less well understood than synaptic vesicle release, dendritic exocytosis \nhas emerged as a key mechanism for regulating synaptic physiology. Among the first \nindications of regulated exocytosis in dendrites came from experiments demonstrat-\ning that the styryl dye FM1-43 accumulates in dendritic TGN-derived compartments \nand can be rapidly unloaded in response to Ca2 influx (174). The finding that this \nactivity-dependent dendritic exocytosis required CaMKII (173) pointed towards a \ndirect link between postsynaptic exocytosis and synaptic plasticity signaling path-\nways. Additional evidence for such a link came from observations that brefeldin A, \nwhich disrupts the secretory pathway, impairs synaptic potentiation in hippocampal \nslices, as does postsynaptic loading of N-ethylmaleimide or botulinum toxin B, two \ninhibitors of membrane fusion (28, 166). In conjunction with the discovery of silent \nsynapses lacking AMPA receptors (see Chapters by Esteban and Lisman and Hell, \nthis volume), these observations suggested that the rapid insertion of AMPA recep-\ntors in the postsynaptic membrane accounted for an early component of the expres-\nsion of LTP. Subsequent imaging studies demonstrated that AMPA receptors rapidly \nappear and accumulate near the postsynaptic plasma membrane and are incorporated \ninto synapses in response to stimuli triggering synapse potentiation (45, 147, 212). \nHowever, the core machinery for postsynaptic exocytosis and the mechanisms cou-\npling NMDA receptor-induced Ca2+ influx to dendritic membrane fusion remain \npoorly understood. Moreover, the exact location of receptor insertion in the dendritic \nmembrane is unclear, although NMDA receptor-induced exocytic events have re-\ncently been visualized in spines (213). For AMPA receptors, either the site of exocy-\ntosis or the location of rapid receptor accumulation after exocytosis, depends on \nsubunit composition, since newly inserted GluR2 receptors accumulate more rapidly \nat synapses than do GluR1 receptors (214, 257). This suggests that a subclass of exo-\ncytic vesicles containing distinct populations of receptors may be inserted in close"}

Genetic ap-\nproaches in this system have provided important clues to the molecular mechanisms"}
{"text": "===== Page 19 =====\nDendritic Organelles for Postsynaptic Trafficking\n223\n \naccounting for postsynaptic exocytosis. For example, the SNARE protein Gtaxin \ninteracts with the postsynaptic scaffolding protein Dlg and is required for the tar-\ngeted delivery of membranes to the postsynapse (82). In addition, synaptotagmin 4 \nserves as a Ca2+ sensor for postsynaptic exocytosis at the fly neuromuscular synapse \n(306), suggesting that mechanisms responsible for regulated postsynaptic exocytosis \nmay be very similar to those operating at presynaptic terminals (see Chapter by \nAtasoy and Kavalali, this volume). Despite these initial clues, many questions re-\nmain, such as the identity and requirement for specific molecules that tether postsy-\nnaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane, and the nature of machinery linking postsy-\nnaptic exocytosis to neural activity. \n4.1.2 Rab Proteins and Dendritic Exocytosis  \nIn addition to SNARE proteins, Rab family GTPases are major regulators of mem-\nbrane trafficking and vesicular fusion. Rab proteins localize to distinct cellular com-\npartments and control trafficking specificity by facilitating interactions between \ndonor and acceptor membranes (90). In general, Rab proteins bind to donor mem-\nbranes in their GTP-bound state and recruit accessory factors that interact with pro-\nteins on the target membrane. When the appropriate combination of vesicle and \ntarget membrane proteins is assembled, Rab proteins hydrolyze their bound GTP, \nlocking the vesicle in place for subsequent fusion (90). \nTwo Rab proteins with well-defined function in non-neuronal cells have been \nshown to regulate postsynaptic receptor exocytosis. Rab11a controls trafficking \nthrough recycling endosomes (291) and is required for NMDA receptor-dependent \nsynapse potentiation including LTP (212). Rab8 is involved in trafficking from the \nTGN to the cell surface (114) and is also required for the postsynaptic delivery of \nAMPA receptor subunits (76). Rab11 resides in recycling endosomes, a compart-\nment through which trafficking is mediated by vesicular fusion involving syntaxin 13 \n(226). Acute disruption of syntaxin 13-dependent trafficking abolishes stimulus-\ndependent insertion of AMPA receptors and accompanying LTP within minutes \n(212), suggesting that this membrane trafficking pathway is immediately proximal to \nNMDA receptor-induced dendritic exocytosis. Still to be determined are the molecu-\nlar mechanisms underlying synaptic activity-dependent regulation of Rab8 and \nRab11. Rab-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase acti-\nvating proteins (GAPs) orchestrate Rab protein function by controlling their activa-\ntion and inactivation (79, 250), and are themselves controlled by numerous signaling \npathways (250), making them particularly attractive candidates for coupling neural \nactivity to postsynaptic exocytosis. \n4.1.3 Myosin Motors and Micron-Range Trafficking of Spine Cargo  \nIn non-neuronal cells, post-TGN transport of secretory cargo to the plasma mem-\nbrane occurs in two general stages. Vesicles are first transported along microtubules \ntowards the cell-periphery by kinesins, and are then transferred to myosin motors, \nmost prominently class V myosins, which translocate vesicles through the F-actin \nnetwork of the cell cortex to bring them close to the plasma membrane (152). Myosins"}
{"text": "===== Page 20 =====\n224 \nC. Hanus and M.D. Ehlers \n \nare multisubunit motor molecules that move cargo along F-actin in a unidirectional \nmanner. Myosin motors have diverse functions in vesicle trafficking. At the plasma \nmembrane, myosins control movements of vesicles during exocytosis and endocyto-\nsis (152). Many types of myosins are expressed in neurons, and although their indi-\nvidual roles are only beginning to emerge, they seem to be especially important for \nsynaptic receptor recycling (26) (Fig. 4). This is particularly true for class V and \nclass VI myosins, which are enriched in dendritic spines (165, 196, 206). While \nmyosin VI regulates AMPA receptor endocytosis by virtue of its ability to move \nvesicles inward toward the pointed or minus-ends of actin filaments (206), members \nof the myosin V family facilitate delivery of AMPA receptors to the dendritic mem-\nbrane (165). \nInterestingly, a light chain common to myosin V and dynein indirectly interacts \nwith AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors via GKAP/PSD95 (196), and class V \nmyosins also associate with specific kinesins (152). Glutamate receptors are thus part \nof multi-protein complexes containing both microtubule and actin motors, a feature \nthat is likely important for the transfer of receptor containing vesicles from the \nmicrotubule-rich dendritic shaft to spines, whose cytoskeleton primarily consists of \nactin. Recent in vitro experiments demonstrated that myosin Va can traverse fila-\nmentous junctions and displays diffusive “scanning” along microtubules (4), empha-\nsizing the ability of this motor to navigate complex cytoskeletal structures. \n4.1.4 The Exocyst  \nClass V myosins are calmodulin-binding molecules and are regulated by cal-\ncium-dependent conformational changes (279). Increasing calcium triggers a con-\nformational change of myosin Va from a closed, inactive, conformation to an open \nconformation that exposes the cargo binding domain. Although not yet fully charac-\nterized in neurons, this calcium-dependent regulation of class V myosins could play \na role in activity-dependent trafficking of cargo to dendritic spines. Indeed myosin \nVa is highly enriched in the PSD (196, 297). However, dilute mutant mice lacking \nmyosin Va have no defects in basal synaptic transmission or LTP at CA1 hippocam-\npal synapses (248) and exhibit no quantitative difference in AMPA receptor abun-\ndance at synapses when assessed by immungold electron microscopy (218). \nGenetic studies of targeted membrane trafficking in S. cerevisiae led to the identifi-\ncation of conserved proteins important for the late processing of post-Golgi vesicles. \nAmong these proteins were components of the exocyst, an octameric protein com-\nplex whose subunits (Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo 70 and Exo84) are \nrequired for tethering vesicles to distinct cellular domains (164). \nIn Drosophila, Sec5 and Sec6 mutants display defective neurite outgrowth re-\nsulting from impaired exocytosis (192, 193). However, synaptic vesicle exocytosis \nat the neuromuscular junction is normal in Sec5 mutants, indicating that the exo-\ncyst is not involved in all forms of exocytosis (192). Other studies in flies revealed \na specific role for Sec15 in axon outgrowth and delivery of a subset of surface \nproteins to the plasma membrane (e.g. fasciclin II and chaoptin) (186), suggesting \nthat particular components of the exocyst complex play distinct roles in neuronal \ntrafficking."}
{"text": "===== Page 21 =====\nDendritic Organelles for Postsynaptic Trafficking\n225\n \nComponents of the exocyst complex are expressed in the mammalian nervous \nsystem (112), and notably in the developing brain where Sec6/8 is present in layers \ndisplaying ongoing synaptogenesis (98). At later stages, the exocyst is broadly ex-\npressed in the adult brain and is enriched in synaptic membranes (112, 244). Consis-\ntent with a role in directing exocytosis to discrete domains, Sec6/8 is located at sites \nof membrane addition, including neurites, filopodia, and growth cones in cultured \nhippocampal neurons (98, 296). More recently, the exocyst has been shown to par-\nticipate in the trafficking of glutamate receptors to the synapse. Specifically, Sec8 \ncontains a PDZ-binding motif that interacts with the synaptic scaffolding proteins \nPSD-95 and SAP102 (244). This interaction thus connects the exocyst complex to \nNMDA receptors and potentially AMPA receptor/TARP complexes, and is required \nfor NMDA receptor trafficking to the cell surface (244). \nThe exocyst also plays an important role during late stages of receptor delivery to \nthe plasma membrane, including in the spine head itself. Overexpression of truncated \nforms of Sec8 and Exo70 uncovered two successive exocyst-dependent steps of \nAMPA receptor exocytosis required for the turnover of synaptic receptors. Whereas \nimpairment of Sec8 leads to the accumulation of AMPA receptor-containing vesicles \nin the dendritic shaft, overexpression of Exo70 mutant results in an accumulation of \nthese vesicles in the spine head, leaving them stranded very close to the PSD (77). \nThese data support the notion that AMPA receptor exocytosis can occur directly in \nspines, and that exocyst subunits play distinct and synergistic functions in the local \ntargeting or tethering of receptor-laden vesicles. \n4.2 Dendritic Endocytosis and Post-Endocytic Sorting \nEukaryotic cells continuously invaginate and internalize portions of their plasma \nmembrane to take up extracellular nutrients, trophic factors, and pathogens, as well \nas to regulate their surface area and control surface levels of membrane proteins. \nClathrin-dependent endocytosis is the best characterized mechanism of membrane \nprotein internalization (139), and has been widely studied in presynaptic terminals \nwhere it mediates the retrieval of synaptic vesicles (see Chapter by McPherson et al., \nthis volume). Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is initiated by adaptor proteins, such as \nAP-2, AP-180, and epsin, which associate with phosphoinositides and membrane \nprotein cargo and nucleate the oligomerization of clathrin into a lattice, or coat, ap-\nposed to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane (215). Upon acquisition of \nmembrane curvature and invagination, clathrin-coated pits bud from the membrane \nto form clathrin-coated vesicles (118, 215). The fission reaction is mediated by \nmembers of the dynamin family of large GTPases, which assemble into oligomeric \nrings or spirals around the necks of coated pits (223). All three dynamin family \nmembers (dynamins 1–3) are expressed in neurons. While dynamin 2 is ubiquitious \nand mediates membrane fission in all cells of the body, dynamin 1 is specialized for \nmembrane recycling of synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic terminal following  \nexocytosis (273). Like dynamin 1, dynamin 3 is enriched in brain, but also localizes \npostsynaptically to dendritic spine heads and may play a role in postsynaptic mem-\nbrane trafficking (87, 292)."}
{"text": "===== Page 22 =====\n226 \nC. Hanus and M.D. Ehlers \n \nExocytosis, endocytosis and post-endocytic sorting represent important check-\npoints for controlling cell-surface signaling. Although relying on the same basic \nmachinery, turnover rates of surface proteins vary greatly, with internalization time \nconstants ranging from seconds for membrane retrival at presynaptic terminals (273), \nto minutes in the case of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (267) and postsynap-\ntic receptors (63, 141, 162). In addition to simply controlling the number of cell-\nsurface receptors, endocytosis is intimately coupled to receptor signaling. A classic \nexample of this is provided by GPCRs and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), whose \nendocytosis is stimulated by agonist binding, and desensitizes the cell toward the \nreceptor ligand (267). In some cases, endocytosis itself is required for signaling since \nsome receptors initiate signal transduction from internal endosomes (54, 99, 110, \n305). \nEndocytosis and endosomal sorting of postsynaptic receptors have emerged as \nkey mechanisms for tuning synaptic responses rapidly within minutes, or more \nslowly during homeostatic scaling and synapse development (45, 290). It is now \nclear that postsynaptic compartments possess an exquisite degree of specialization \nfor receptor internalization and post-endocytic trafficking (Fig. 4). This specializa-\ntion is reflected by the diverse stimuli that trigger postsynaptic endocytosis, the com-\nplex biochemical interactions that link synaptic receptors to endocytic effectors, and \nthe organization of the spine membrane itself. \n4.2.1 Activity-Dependent Regulation of Endocytosis and Post-endocytic Sorting  \nOne indication of an intimate relationship between postsynaptic proteins and endo-\ncytic machinery comes from biochemical data showing that postsynaptic receptors \nand scaffolds directly interact with the endocytic machinery. For example, Homer \nand mGluR5 interact with dynamin 3 (87), and both the AMPA receptor subunit \nGluR2 and the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B interact with the AP-2 clathrin adap-\ntor complex (130, 155, 158, 234). The GABAA receptor subunits β1-3 and γ2 also \nbind AP-2, indicating that similar mechanisms operate at inhibitory synapses (141). \nConsistently, interfering with receptor internalization leads to modifications of both \nexcitatory and inhibitory synaptic responses, sometime within minutes (45). Indeed, \nthe regulation of postsynaptic receptor endocytosis is a key set-point for various \nform of synaptic plasticity. \nAs initially established for AMPA receptors, internalization rates and post-\nendocytic sorting are directly modulated by synaptic activity (63, 159, 162). Various \nmechanisms account for the regulation of AMPA receptor endocytosis, and endocy-\ntosis can be triggered either directly by agonist binding, or indirectly by Ca2+- and \nphosphatase-dependent signaling cascades. Control of postsynaptic receptor inter-\nnalization involves a broad cast of proteins, including hippocalcin (211), Rab5 (29), \nCPG2 (48), Arc/Arg3.1. (40), and a significant array of receptor binding partners \n(45) (see Chapters by Esteban, Wenthold et al., and Lorena Arancibia-Carcamo et \nal., this volume). \nThe actin cytoskeleton is a critical determinant of the local dynamics of mem-\nbrane proteins (150), and actin dynamics are tightly controlled at all steps of endocy-\ntosis (68). Accordingly, actin polymerization and depolymerization are required for"}
{"text": "===== Page 23 =====\nDendritic Organelles for Postsynaptic Trafficking\n227\n \nstimulus-dependent endocytosis of AMPA receptors (309), and actin plays a critical \nrole in the structural maintenance and plasticity of dendritic spines. It is thus not \nsurprising that spines contain numerous actin regulatory proteins (58). Some of these \nproteins, notably cortactin (88, 195, 228), Arc/Arg3.1 (40, 170) and myosin VI (206) \nparticipate in AMPA receptor endocytosis. In the case of NMDA receptors, the en-\ndocytic adaptor PACSIN-1/syndapin-1, which interacts with dynamin and N-WASP \nand thereby couples actin dynamics to endocytosis (136), directly binds the noncan-\nonical subunit NR3A and drives receptor internalization (216). That actin dynamics \nis itself regulated by synaptic activity (43, 205, 269) suggests that cytoskeletal re-\nmodeling links activity-dependent signaling to the endocytic machinery. \nFollowing endocytosis, the fate of internalized postsynaptic cargo is governed by \nextrinsic factors such as synaptic activity or metabotropic receptors. For example, \nwhile AMPA receptors internalized in response to AMPA stimulation are trafficked \nto dendritic lysosomes and degraded, receptors internalized in response to NMDA \nstimulation are sorted into recycling endosomes in a PKA-dependent manner (63). \nThis endosomal sorting is regulated by the duration of the stimulus (265) and can in \nturn be altered by long-term changes in network activity (159, 201). In a comparable \nmanner, synaptic activity also determines the fate of internalized kainate receptors \n(178). The subunit composition within a given receptor subtype also modifies the \nbehavior of internalized receptors. In the case of NMDA receptors, NR2A and NR2B \nsubunits contain distinct post-endocytic sorting motifs, which direct them along \ndegradative and recycling pathways, respectively (154). In addition, both NR1 and \nNR2 subunits contain conserved membrane proximal motifs, which direct internal-\nized receptors for degradation by default if not counteracted by the C-terminal recy-\ncling motifs present in NR2B (249). \n4.2.2 The Spine Endocytic Zone  \nBy directly visualizing clathrin coats, Blanpied et al. (2002) showed that clathrin \npuncta localize to most hippocampal dendritic spines in close proximity to the PSD \n(Fig. 5ab) (17). Live cell imaging together with fluorescence recovery after photo-\nbleaching (FRAP) indicated that clathrin repeatedly assembles and disassembles at \nspecific endocytic sites in dendrites and spines (17). The concentration and internali-\nzation of labeled transferrin at these spine clathrin puncta established that they are \nfunctional, thus demonstrating the existence of stable endocytic zones in close asso-\nciation with the PSD at glutamatergic synapses (17). Ultrastructural analysis con-\nfirmed the presence of coated structures in spines in vivo recapitulating all the early \nstages of the endocytic process (Fig. 5c) (219, 228). Immunogold labeling of its core \ncomponents revealed an exquisite level of spatial organization of the clathrin endo-\ncytic machinery in spines, where AP-2, clathrin and dynamin are localized on the \nlateral side of the spine surface, with AP-2 closest and dynamin furthest from the \nPSD (228) (Fig. 5d). In some cases, clathrin and AP-2 are detected at the spine \nplasma membrane in the absence of a morphologically identified coated pit (228) \n(Fig. 5d), suggesting a pre-organization of endocytic molecules at the lateral spine \nmembrane."}

Rab5 overexpression does not alter the spine/shaft ratio \nof total (internal and surface) AMPA receptors, but rather selectively decreases the \nnumber of receptors at the spine surface (29). This indicates that some internalized \nreceptors remain in the spine, supporting a model where receptors internalized at endo-\ncytic zones on the spine surface are retained in a local endosomal pool (Fig. 4). \nWhile the presence of endocytic zones at inhibitory synapses has not been exten-\nsively studied, immunolabeling of newly endocytosed GABAA receptors docu-\nmented the presence of a stable pool of internalized receptors in close proximity to \ninhibitory synapses (295). Although the identity of these compartments awaits fur-\nther investigation, these findings suggest that specialized endocytic machinery may \nalso exist at inhibitory synapses.

Inter-\nnalization of cell-surface AMPA receptors occurs with a time constant of approxi-\nmately 10 min under basal conditions, and reaches a steady state that plateaus after \n15–20 min, a time point at which approximately 15–20% of initially labeled recep-\ntors are internalized (63, 162). This apparent rate represents a balance between endo-\ncytosis itself and cycling of molecules (initially labeled when at the cell-surface) \nbetween endosomes and the plasma membrane. \nFocusing selectively on the exocytosis of internalized molecules, it was shown \nthat almost 90% of internalized receptors are reinserted in the cell-surface within 60 \nmin under basal conditions, with a similar time constant of 10 min (63). As with \ninternalization, the rate or reinsertion is directly modulated by neuronal activity. This \ndemonstrates that both endocytosis and reinsertion are controlled by activity, and \nalso indicates that the kinetics of reinsertion to the cell-surface can determine the \nspeed and timing of receptor turnover. Adding to this rather complex regulation of \ntrafficking kinetics, selective activation of synaptic AMPA receptors and NMDA \nreceptors can change the compartmental itinerary of internalized cargo by differen-\ntially routing internalized AMPA receptors for lysosomal degradation, which in turn \nleads to changes in the number of receptors in the recycling pool (63, 159, 162). Alto-\ngether, these data strongly suggest that recycling endosomes function as a kinetic trap \nwhereby activity-dependent tuning of receptor recycling kinetics and endosomal sort-\ning controls the abundance of postsynaptic receptors in an online fashion (Fig. 4). \nAs previously mentioned, morphological studies have demonstrated the presence \nof an endosomal network throughout dendrites, and have specifically shown that \nrecycling endosomes (REs) reside at the base of, and in some instance within, den-\ndritic spines (Fig. 3) (47, 63, 213). This spatial distribution of REs is particularly \nsurprising given that these compartments are usually found in the peri-nuclear area in \nnon-neuronal cells (Fig. 1) (187), and suggests that dendritic REs may play a general \nrole in a local trafficking of postsynaptic cargo. Indeed, whereas some dendritic \nAMPA receptors are transported to the cell body after endocytosis, an important \nfraction of internalized receptors remain in dendrites (63, 159, 162). Mechanisms by \nwhich different classes of endosomes are positioned in dendrites and spines, and the \nmachinery that determines whether internalized postsynaptic cargo molecules are de-\ngraded or locally recycled back to the dendritic surface are only beginning to emerge. \nThe neuron-enriched endosomal protein of 21 kDa (Neep21) localizes to early \nendosomes and facilitates recycling of surface receptors (53, 271). In hippocampal \nneurons Neep21 loss of function decreases recycling of internalized GluR1 and \nGluR2 (271). This effect is mediated, at least for GluR2, by an activity-dependent \ninteraction between Neep21 and GRIP1, since disrupting this interaction causes \nGluR2, but not GluR1 or transferrin receptor, to accumulate in early endosomes and \nlysosomes (270). Consistent with a function of Neep21 in activity-dependent recy-\ncling of AMPA receptor, disrupting Neep21 expression in hippocampal slices im-\npairs LTP (3). The activity dependence of the Neep21/GRIP1 interaction suggests"}
{"text": "===== Page 26 =====\n230 \nC. Hanus and M.D. Ehlers \n \nthat synaptic activity defines the fraction of internalized receptor that is sorted for \nrecycling at a given synapse, and conversely that this sorting step might tune the \namount of receptor available for activity-dependent synaptic potentiation. \nOverexpressing dominant-inhibitory mutants of Rab11a, Rme1/EHD1, or syn-\ntaxin-13, three molecules required form endocytic recycling, Park et al. (2004) (212) \ndirectly tested the role of REs in excitatory receptor trafficking (Fig. 6a). An impor-\ntant finding of this study was that blocking post-endocytic recycling not only de-\ncreases the basal level of surface AMPA receptors, but also prevents the rapid \nNMDA receptor-dependent insertion of GluR1 at hippocampal synapses, as well as \nLTP expression at Schaffer collateral/CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices. Finally, \nby selectively tagging or masking those receptors originally at the plasma membrane \nor those receptors cycling between the cell-surface and endocytic structures, this \nstudy established that AMPA receptors rapidly recruited at synapses are mobilized \nfrom a pool of internalized molecules, demonstrating the fundamental importance of \nREs in synapse plasticity. \n4.2.4 Endosomal Recycling as a Cellular Basis for Spine Structural Plasticity  \nWhile mature neurons maintain their overall size and architecture over years, den-\ndritic spines can be highly dynamic, growing and shrinking over minutes (184, 198). \nAt the scale of the entire cell, endocytosis and exocytosis balance each other to main-\ntain cellular surface area. However, the continuous appearance and disappearance of \nsome dendritic spines necessarily requires increases or decreases in local membrane \narea. One attractive mechanism for refining spine morphology is local addition or \nremoval of membrane by exocytosis and endocytosis. Indeed, the observation that \nspine volume correlates with the size of the PSD, the number of postsynaptic AMPA \nreceptors and the abundance of spine endomembranes (100, 169, 182, 283) suggests \na quantitative coupling between membrane trafficking, synaptic strength, and spine \nsize. Consistent with this notion, LTP- and LTD-inducing stimuli trigger an increase \nor decrease in spine size, respectively (151, 183, 194, 207, 308). \nThe source of membrane for local spine growth has been a matter of debate since \nthe dendritic shaft, and in some cases the spine head itself, house a wide array of \nendomembranes (135), and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton alone can expand \ncellular membranes (70). The recently recognized contribution of endosomal recy-\ncling in glutamatergic synapse maintenance and plasticity prompted experiments to \ntest whether REs contribute to spine growth. Combining three-dimensional serial \nreconstruction electron microscopy and high resolution fluorescence timelapse imag-\ning, Park et al. (2006) (213) showed that spine growth is correlated with both the \ntranslocation of endosomal compartments in growing spines and the local exocytosis \nof RE cargo, occurring in some instances directly in the spine head (Fig. 6b). Fur-\nthermore, Rab11a and syntaxin 13 mutants that block endosomal recycling impair \nstimulus-induced spine growth, thus demonstrating that recycling endosomes con-\ntribute membrane material for spine growth (213). By supplying both AMPA recep-\ntors (212) and membrane material (213) during LTP, activity-induced cargo transport \nfrom recycling endosomes provides an attractive mechanism for coupling functional \nand structural plasticity at glutamatergic synapses."}

{"text": "===== Page 28 =====\n232 \nC. Hanus and M.D. Ehlers \n \nIntriguingly, the importance of Rab11-dependent membrane recycling in the con-\ntrol of cell geometry seems to extend beyond plastic changes of spine morphology, \nas indicated by the recent characterization of protrudin, a mammalian Rab11-GDP \nbinding protein which promotes and controls neurite formation (259). Spatially di-\nrected membrane trafficking from recycling endosomes may thus be a general \nmechanism for neuronal growth and structural plasticity during the elaboration and \nremodeling of diverse neural circuits.\n5 Concluding Remarks \nThe discovery that membrane trafficking underlies diverse forms of neuronal plastic-\nity represents a major advance, providing a focal point for experiments addressing \nthe basic mechanisms of learning and memory. Many core issues of neuronal devel-\nopment and circuit plasticity can now be framed as cell biological problems, raising \nfundamental questions as to how conserved cellular machinery (Fig. 1) has evolved \nand adapted to serve specialized functions in the mammalian brain. Though far from \ncomplete, a picture is emerging of a previously unanticipated and remarkable degree \nof molecular dynamics at synapses orchestrated by conserved trafficking machinery \nand diverse dendritic organelles which are regulated by synaptic activity. These \nmolecular dynamics function to maintain reliable, but still exquisitely plastic, com-\nmunication between highly interconnected cells (Fig. 4). While general rules cou-\npling changes of synaptic strength to membrane trafficking are becoming clarified, \nour understanding of how cell biological events coordinate neuronal physiology is \nstill constrained by unresolved questions. What controls the organization and distri-\nbution of dendritic organelles themselves? To what extent are changes in synaptic \nstrength confined to specific synapses, and under which circumstances? What is the \nmolecular machinery that couples neural activity to dendritic membrane trafficking? \nWhile much recent work has focused on the trafficking of postsynaptic receptors \nto and from the synapse, it is clear that the trafficking of other synaptic proteins, such \nas adhesion molecules (83, 224, 247), CaMKII (80), PSD-95 (44, 65, 78, 254), and \ngephyrin (94, 172) is equally important in tuning synaptic properties (116). A de-\ntailed description of the fundamental organization of neuronal organelles will be \nessential to understand how the regulation of multiprotein complexes produces the \nrequisite integration of diverse signals for coordinating functional and structural \nplasticity. The relative contribution of long-range versus local trafficking in the de-\nvelopment, maintenance, and plasticity of single synapses is not established. Within \na given cell, mechanisms accounting for the turnover and plastic changes of synapses \nvary with synapse localization. For example, recent data suggest that endosomal \ntrafficking and lateral diffusion may differentially contribute to postsynaptic recep-\ntors at synapses localized near the soma and those localized to distal dendrites (2). In \npyramidal neurons, Golgi outposts are present primarily in apical dendrites (108), \nsuggesting distinct mechanisms in apical versus basolateral dendrites. Indeed syn-\napses onto these dendritic compartments contain different subclasses of NMDA \nreceptors (131), and perhaps other molecules. One possibility is that a heterogeneous \nspatial restriction of neuronal organelles such as the Golgi apparatus, post-Golgi"}
{"text": "===== Page 29 =====\nDendritic Organelles for Postsynaptic Trafficking\n233\n \ncompartments, or various classes of endosomes contributes to spatial variation in \nsynapse composition. \nAt the level of single spines, the actin cytoskeleton is a central effector that cou-\nples morphological and functional synaptic plasticity. Although actin can directly \naffect the organization of the PSD itself (5, 37, 43, 149), its contribution to local \nspine membrane trafficking is only beginning to emerge. An intriguing observation \nis that while synaptic activity triggers the recruitment of membrane bound structures \nin the spine head (213, 282, 283), the diffusional coupling between the spine head \nand the dendritic shaft is simultaneously decreased (18). A detailed description of \nspine neck properties will be crucial to understand how calcium signaling, actin \ndynamics, and membrane trafficking are coordinated to control spine size and mo-\nlecular composition. \nFinally, from a clinical perspective, recent findings illustrate how core issues of \ndendritic membrane trafficking open new perspectives for therapeutic strategies. For \nexample, the Huntington’s disease protein huntingtin binds to proteins such as HIP \n(huntingtin interacting protein) 1 and HIP14 which participate in the control of in-\nhibitory (142, 143, 156, 209) and excitatory receptor (113) turnover, respectively. \nThe role of postsynaptic trafficking in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is particularly inter-\nesting. It has been known for some time that the processing of the amyloid precursor \nprotein during β-amyloid (Aβ) production occurs during trafficking through secre-\ntory and endocytic compartments (93), and swollen neuronal endosomes correlate \nwith disease in late-onset AD (34–36, 89, 199). Recent data indicate that Aβ release \nis activity-dependent, and liberated Aβ in turn attenuates synaptic strength (129) \nthrough mechanisms that share similarities with LTD, including increased endocyto-\nsis of postsynaptic glutamate receptors (111, 129, 202, 253, 264). Conversely, Aβ \noligomers block LTP (298) and presumably AMPA receptor insertion. Thus, it is \ntempting to speculate that at its early stages, AD is a disorder of postsynaptic traf-\nficking and synapse dysfunction. Beyond neurodegenerative diseases, alterations in \nglutamate receptor trafficking and defects in synaptic properties have been reported \nin animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders including addiction (22, 304) and \nschizophrenia (153), as well as in models of congenital mental retardation (8, 15, \n109, 146). Autism has been associated with mutations in specific neuroligin isoforms \n(121). These mutations impair the expression of these adhesion molecules at the \nplasma membrane (42, 46), and are likely to have important consequences on synap-\ntic properties given the importance of neuroligins in the clustering of postsynaptic \nproteins (83, 247). Regulation of dendritic organelles and trafficking machinery is \nthus requisite for modifying neural circuits during development and plasticity, and \nprovides a novel venue for restoring neuronal function in injury and disease. \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank Morgan Sheng for insightful comments on the manuscript.

Bioinformantic studies played \na key role in this work by revealing that iGluRs were modular proteins in which the \nindividual domains showed sequence, and thus most likely structural homology with \na series of bacterial proteins (20, 26, 40). Such approaches revealed that the ion \nchannel of iGluRs has a pore loop motif like that in cyclic nucleotide and voltage-\ngated ion channels (21), and that its structure must closely resemble that of KcsA, \nthe first ion channel protein to be crystallized (10).

This initially made no sense when the \nmembrane topology of iGluRs was thought to be similar to that of the cys-loop \nfamily of ligand gated ion channels, since one half of the putative ligand binding \ndomain was on the extracellular side of the post synaptic membrane, while the \nsecond half was on the intracellular side. Assignment of the correct membrane \ntopology resolved this problem, but raised the question as to how the ligand binding \ndomain could function when split into two halves by the membrane embedded ion \nchannel segment. The answer to this question lies at the heart of how iGluRs use the \nconformational change induced by the binding of glutamate to gate the ion channel, \nand reveal a beautiful example of molecular evolution. The solution to the problem \ncame from the combination of crystallography, patch clamp recording, and \nbiophysical chemistry, and as a result we now have substantial insight into the \nmechanisms underlying iGluR activation, desensitization, allosteric modulation, and \npartial agonist activity. As important, we can now explain in atomic detail the \nselective binding properties of all of the major iGluR families, and several groups are \nusing this information for the development subtype selective ligands, the availability \nof which will allow unprecedented functional studies to address the role of iGluRs in \nsynaptic function. \n3 Mechanism of Activation by Glutamate \nThe ligand binding domains of iGluRs are evolutionarily related to bacterial \nperiplasmic binding proteins, the structures of numerous examples of which had \nbeen solved prior to the beginning of similar work on iGluRs. Thus, the idea that the \nindividual ligand binding cores of iGluRs use a ‘Venus fly trap’ mechanism to bind \nglutamate had precedent from prior structural studies on bacterial periplasmic \nproteins, which crystallize in an ‘open’ conformation in the absence of substrate, and \na ‘closed’ conformation when substrate is bound (34). The extent of domain closure \nin iGluRs, while not as large as observed in the fly trap of insectivorous plants, is \nnonetheless substantial, between 20–30°, and differs for individual ligands and \niGluR subtypes. The ‘fly trap’ has two domains (D1 and D2) which are connected by \na flexible hinge formed by antiparallel beta strands. The first crystal structure of an \niGluR ligand binding domain revealed that insertion of the ion channel segment does \nnot destroy its function because the linkers leading to the ion channel proper all \nemerge from the bottom surface of D2 (5). \n \nFrom a mechanistic perspective the most striking observation to emerge from \nstructural studies was the discovery that the isolated ligand binding cores assemble \nas dimers (2), since this immediately suggested experimentally testable models for \nactivation (Fig. 1b). Also important was the discovery that agonists, partial agonists, \nand competitive antagonists stabilize the ligand binding domain in different \nconformations. The dimers are formed by a back to back assembly, in which the \nintermolecular contacts stabilizing the dimer assembly are made exclusively by the \nrear surface of domain 1, so that the entrance to the ligand binding site faces \noutwards, and is accessible to the extracellular solution in the postsynaptic"}

Ion channel activation occurs because, \nfollowing the binding of glutamate, D2 in the pair of subunits in a dimer assembly \nmoves in a scissors-like motion (Fig. 1b). This exerts strain on the ion channel, \n‘pulling’ it into the open conformation because the outward movement of D2 and its \nassociated linkers applies force to the TM helices, which favors the open channel \nconformation. This model is bolstered by crystallographic studies on potassium \nchannels, which reveal that in the closed conformation the channel has a teepee like \nstructure (10), and that in the open conformation the smoke hole opens (17). \n \nAlthough this model for iGluR gating was developed using crystal structures of \nthe isolated ligand binding domain, which constitutes roughly 25% of the mass of an \nintact iGluR, there is essentially no doubt that its is correct, although important \ndetails will only be resolved when we have crystal structures of full length iGluRs. \nSeveral experimental results give us confidence in this model. First, deletion of the \nATD, which removes approximately 40% of the mass of an iGluR, leaves activation \nand desensitization intact, and in both AMPA and kainate receptors gating occurs \nwith essentially wild type kinetics (15, 31, 33). Second, structural studies on \npotassium channels, some of which share a related gating mechanism, provide clear \nprecedent for a mechanical linkage between the ion channel pore and the ligand \nbinding domain. Third, iGluR dimers, chemically cross-linked via introduction of \nintermolecular disulfide bridges to trap them in the permissive conformation for \nactivation by glutamate, continue to show normal ion channel activation (46). Key \ndetails missing from this picture include the lack of any real understanding of how \nthe pair of dimers in a tetrameric iGluR assembly are packed with respect to each \nother, and knowledge of the extent of movement that occurs in the ion channel \nduring the transition from the resting to open conformation. Although \ncrystallographic studies with agonists and antagonists clearly reveal that the ligand \nbinding domains can move large distances, it is by no means certain that the ion \nchannel moves as much. The extent of movement will be determined by the structure \nof the linkers which connect the ion channel proper with D2; rigid linkers would \nimpose large movements on the ion channel TM domains; flexible, perhaps \ndisordered linkers, would absorb large movements, and impose much less force on \nthe ion channel. \n \nAn understanding of the structure of the dimer of dimers assembly that must \noccur in the extracellular segments of a tetrameric iGluR is critical to several issues. \nFirst, we have no real understanding of the extent of cross talk, if any, between the \ndimers; this will of course have a large impact on the cooperativity of ion channel \nactivation. Second, lack of information about the connectivity between the ATD \ndimers and the ligand binding domain dimers prevents us from understanding how \nallosteric modulators act on the ATD to modulate ion channel gating. This is \nparticularly important in the case of NMDA receptors (see chapter by Yuan et al.) \nThird, the transition from a dimer of dimers assembly to the ion channel segment, \nwhich must contain elements of 4-fold symmetry, presents the conundrum that, at \nleast in homomeric iGluR assemblies, chemically identical peptide chains will need \nto assume different conformations to accommodate the symmetry mismatch. \nHowever, it is possible that in iGluRs the ion channel does not show perfect 4-fold"}

The dimer assembly observed in AMPA \nreceptor crystal structures provided an explanation for these results, and suggested \nthat a pivoting motion of the pair of subunits in a dimer assembly, around an axis \nrunning close to the boundary between domains 1 and 2, would allow the ion channel \nlinkers to relax back towards their resting position, shutting the ion channel, even \nthough the individual ligand binding cores remained in their active closed cleft \nconformation (42). Direct support for this model came from combining the results of \nmeasurement of the affinity for dimer formation by a series of mutants of the isolated \nligand binding cores, using analytical centrifugation, with functional measurements \nof the extent of desensitization measured in intact receptors, using rapid perfusion \ntechniques and outside-out patch recording (42). This revealed that the rate of onset \nof desensitization was inversely correlated with the Kd for dimer formation by the \nisolated ligand binding cores: mutations that disrupted dimer formation accelerated \ndesensitization, and mutations that stabilized the dimer slowed desensitization. \nConsistent with this, allosteric modulators that attenuate desensitization were found \nto stabilize dimer assemblies. Moreover, crystal structures of AMPA receptor \ncomplexes with cyclothiazide and aniracetam revealed that the modulators bind at \nthe base of the dimer assembly, forming cross-links between each subunit, and \nsterically obstructing the rotation required to allow each of the subunits in a dimer \npair to pivot into the desensitized state (19, 42). One key aspect of this model is that \nit implies that desensitization is a process that occurs within a dimer, and is not the \nresult of a conformational change in individual iGluR subunits. This was further \nreinforced by disulfide cross linking experiments in which pairs of cysteine residues \nengineered into the dimer interface, to covalently trap the dimer in a conformation \npermissive for activation by glutamate, were shown to abolish desensitization (46). \nThis result unambiguously establishes the dimer model for desensitization, and raises \nthe question of how much cross talk, if any, occurs between dimer partners in AMPA \nand kainate receptors. \n \nHints about the structure of the desensitized state came from a clever series of \nexperiments in which the pair of subunits in a glutamate bound GluR2 dimer were \nindividually docked onto the domain 2 coordinates of the GluR2 apo crystal structure \nto generate a 1st approximation of the conformation of the desensitized state. The \nresulting model structure suggested the location of positions at which cysteine \nresidues could be introduced to trap the receptor in the desensitized state (3). These \nmutants were then tested in functional assays using intact receptors, searching for \npositions at which reducing agents produced a large potentiation of glutamate \nresponses following the introduction of cysteine residues. Once these sites were \nidentified, the corresponding cross-linked dimer was crystallized to reveal the \nconformation of the desensitized state (Fig. 2b). As expected, both ligand binding \ncores remain in their closed cleft glutamate bound conformation, but due to pivoting \naround an axis parallel to the dimer interface, the separation of the domain 2 linkers \nthat lead to the ion channel, decreases by nearly 14Å, which is sufficient to allow the \nion channel to enter a non-conducting state, which however is not necessarily the \nsame as the resting closed state (3). Further support for a partial collapse of the dimer \ninterface during entry into the desensitized state came from measuring the state"}

These positions mapped to structures that are buried in the \nresting and active conformations, but which become solvent exposed when the dimer \ncollapses into its desensitized conformation. \n \nThe conformational changes underlying activation and desensitization described \nin above sections are likely to apply in broad detail to all subtype of iGluRs, \nincluding NMDA receptors, although the extent of the allosteric coupling between \nthe ligand binding domain and the ion channel clearly differs between receptor \nfamilies. The basis for this is not well understood at present, and will likely only be \nrevealed when structures are solved for intact receptors from members of several \niGluR subtypes. Thus, despite the spectacular advances which have revealed the \ngeneral mechanisms by which iGluRs work, our understanding of how individual \nreceptor subtypes gain their unique functional properties is still quite vague. \n5 The Agonist Binding Site \nThe ligand binding cores have been the subject of substantial structural work, and \ncrystal structures have been solved for GluR2, GluR5, GluR6, NR1, NR2A, NR3A \nand NR3B, delta 2, as well as for GluR0, a prokaryotic glutamate receptor ion \nchannel that plausibly represents an ancestral precursor to the large family of diverse \niGluRs that have evolved in eukaryotes. At the time of writing the only missing \nmembers are the KA subtype kainate receptors. Strikingly different from the cys-\nloop family of ligand gated ion channels, in which agonists bind at the interface \nbetween subunits, in iGluRs the agonist binding site is a self contained structure, four \ncopies of which are present in each subunit. Thus, for AMPA and kainate receptors \nthere are four glutamate binding sites per receptor, while for NMDA receptors there \nare two glycine and two glutamate binding sites (see chapter by Yuan et al.) \n \nThe neurotransmitter L-glutamate is a bifunctional molecule in which the alpha \ncarboxylate and ammonium groups interact principally with domain 1, while the \ngamma carboxylate group interacts exclusively with domain 2 (Fig. 3). A conserved \narginine side chain forms a salt bridge with the agonist alpha carboxylate group, \nwhile main chain amide and carbonyl groups form hydrogen bonds with the alpha \ncarboxylate and ammonium groups respectively. Coordination of the alpha \nammonium group is in addition mediated via a salt bridge with a conserved \nglutamate or aspartate side chain (Glu707 in Fig. 3), but this interaction is \nconformation specific, occurs only in the closed cleft active conformation, and is not \npossible in the apo state because the acidic side chain is blocked by formation of a \nsalt bridge with a lysine side chain that projects up from one of the interdomain beta \nstrands that form the base of the ligand binding domain (2). Thus, during the initial \nencounter of glutamate with the receptor, the ligand alpha carbon carboxylate and \namino groups most likely dock with the domain 1 binding site, displacing bound \nwater molecules, and only after this complex is formed does cleft closure and \nglutamate interaction with domain 2 occur (1, 4).

The stability of the closed cleft glutamate bound conformation is \ndetermined in part by residues at the lip of the clam shell, which differ in GluR2 and \nGluR6. Exchange of these tunes the kinetics of deactivation and recovery from \ndesensitization (45). Such experiments produced both AMPA receptor gain of \nfunction mutants, in which the time constant of recovery from desensitization for \nGluR2 was slowed 5-fold, by introducing pairs of aspartate residues from kainate \nreceptors in place of the alanine and serine residues in wild type GluR2, as well as \nkainate receptor loss of function mutants in which the time constant of recovery from \ndesensitization was increased up to six-fold by breaking interdomain contacts in \nGluR6 (45). \n \nAt the time of writing only two iGluR apo structures have been solved, those for \nGluR2 and delta 2 and these give us our sole view of the resting state of an iGluR \nligand binding domain dimer assembly. For other receptor subtypes we have a series of \ncompetitive antagonist structures, which might be considered equivalent to the apo \nstate, and indeed clearly define the mechanism of action of competitive antagonists as \ndue to steric occlusion via a foot in the door effect, which prevents the domain closure \nnecessary to trigger ion channel activation. These structures reveal a surprisingly large \nrange of differences in domain closure relative to the GluR2 apo structure, and indicate \nthat in order to be able to bind antagonists of different structure the iGluR ligand \nbinding cores must be extremely flexible proteins which can sample a wide range of \nconformations in solution, and also in the intact protein. Without additional apo \nstructures it is not possible to determine if some of these antagonist structures are \nhyper-extended compared to the apo conformation, and even when this information \nbecomes available, we will need to consider that the conformation of the apo state \nobserved in crystal structures is likely to some unknown degree to be influenced by \ncontacts with the crystal lattice and/or NCS related molecules. One solution to this \nproblem would be to obtain high resolution NMR structures of the isolated ligand \nbinding domain, but even this leaves unaddressed a second concern that excision from \nthe ion channel frees the ligand binding domain from steric constraints which might \nlimit its range of motion in an intact receptor. Even with all of these caveats in mind, it \nis remarkable how much insight has been gained into iGluR function from study of the \nisolated ligand binding domains. \n6 Chemistry of Ligand Binding and Subtype Pharmacology \nBecause the structure of the domain 1 binding site is highly conserved in different \niGluRs (Fig. 3), virtually all of the selectivity for drugs which bind to the discrete \nsubtypes of iGluRs arises from amino acid sequence variations in the domain 2 \nsurface of the ligand binding site. Thus, with crystal structures in hand, the structural \nbasis for the rich pharmacology of iGluRs can now be understood and exploited for \ndrug design. There is a surprisingly large variation in volume of the ligand binding \ncavity in individual iGluRs, which ranges from about 50Å3 in the NR1, NR3A and \nNR3B subunits, to 218 Å3 for GluR2, 255 Å3 for GluR6 and 305Å3 for GluR5. In all \nof these structures agonists are buried in the interior of the protein and are \ncompletely desolvated with respect to bulk solvent. In the case of AMPA and kainate"}

Thus, although glutamate interacts with \nhighly conserved structures in the ligand binding domains of the 9 AMPA and \nkainate receptor genes, in the surrounding protein landscape there exist cavities and \nprotrusions, with unique chemical profiles. These permit the high affinity binding of \nAMPA to GluR1-4, but absolutely exclude AMPA binding to GluR6 by steric \nocclusion (23). Similar steric exclusion mechanisms underlie the selective binding of \n5-substituted willardiine agonists to GluR5 but not GluR6 subtype kainate receptors, \nand the high selectivity of the competitive antagonist UBP310 for GluR5 versus \nAMPA receptors, and other subtypes of kainate receptor (24). As discussed later, \nsteric effects also play a key role in the mechanism of action of partial agonists. In \nthe case of the NR1, NR3A and NR3B subunits, which bind glycine, the small size \nof the ligand binding cavity cannot accommodate glutamate due to steric clash with \nthe gamma carboxylate group, and this simple fact explains the exquisite \ndiscrimination by these subunits between glutamate and glycine. \n \nThe chemistry of ligand interaction with iGluRs is enormously rich, and much \nmore complex than we can explain. That is, in most cases we are unable to predict \nthe affinity of ligand binding with any degree of accuracy. The reasons for this are \ncomplex, but include the complex electrostatic environment of the ligand binding \nsite; the need to model solvent structure in the ligand binding site and how this is \naltered upon ligand binding; the need to describe the change in entropy of ligands \nwith highly mobile groups on transfer from solution to the conformation adopted \nwhen bound to the protein; the change in solvation energy of ligand upon transfer \nfrom solution into the ligand binding site; and of course the energy difference \nbetween the apo and ligand bound conformational states of the protein. As a ‘simple’ \nexample it is interesting to consider the case of 2S,4R-4-methylglutamate, a potent \nkainate receptor agonist that has been widely used in radioligand binding assays \nbecause of its high affinity compared to glutamate. The addition of a single methyl \ngroup to the Cγ atom of glutamate, to yield 2S,4R-4-methylglutamate, increases \naffinity for GluR6 by 40-fold, from a Kd of 1.4 µM to 36 nM, but decreases affinity \nfor GluR2 by 33-fold, from a Kd of 0.8 µM to 27 µM. How does addition of a single \nmethyl group to glutamate have such a dramatic and selective effect? Crystal \nstructures of the GluR6 ligand complexes reveal that the mechanism of binding of \n2S,4R-4-methylglutamate to GluR6 is identical to that for glutamate, with the \nexception that the 4-methyl group makes additional van der Waals contacts with \nTyrosine 457 and Valine 654. Least squares superposition of Cα positions for the \nGluR6 glutamate and 2S,4R-4-methylglutamate structures gave rmsds of 0.12 Å \nindicating essentially identical structures. The extent of domain closure in the 2S,4R-\n4-methylglutamate and glutamate structures, 26.4° and 26.6° is also identical within \nthe limits of experimental error (23). \n \nThe following three differences between glutamate and its 4-methyl derivative \nare sufficient to explain with quite good accuracy the difference in binding energy of \nthe two compounds. First, addition of the methyl group to give the 4R enantiomer \nintroduces a steric barrier that favors the conformation glutamate adopts when bound \nto GluR6; this gives about a 1.34 kcal per mole increase in binding energy. Second,"}
{"text": "===== Page 11 =====\nStructure and Mechanism of Action of AMPA and Kainate Receptors\n261\n \nthe methyl group is shielded from bulk solvent in the GluR6 complex, and this \ntransfer from an aqueous environment to a hydrophobic cavity yields about 1.2 kcal \nper mole; third, van der Waals contacts of the ligand methyl group with the greasy \nmethylene atoms of the Tyrosine 457 and Valine 654 side chains gives a boost in \naffinity of somewhat less than a kcal per mole. In contrast, for AMPA receptors, the \nsubstitution of a larger leucine side chain at the position equivalent to valine 654, \nintroduces a steric clash with the 4-methyl group, which requires the receptor \nbinding site to expand to relieve the steric constraint, explaining why glutamate \nbinds with higher affinity than its 4-methyl derivative. From this example one begins \nto see that computational docking experiments that ignore the complex chemistry of \nligand binding are unlikely to accurately predict ligand affinity, although of course \nthey are still very valuable tools for drug design, since they can eliminate many poor \ncandidates, and aid in the design of new drugs that can be tested experimentally with \nincreased anticipation of a successful outcome as a result of rational drug design.  \n7 Mechanism of Partial Agonist Activity \nA large number of AMPA and kainate receptor agonist complexes have been solved \nfor GluR2, GluR5, GluR6 and these revealed the striking observation that for a given \nreceptor species and crystal system, the extent of domain closure differed by less \nthan 1° for most agonists. In contrast, there is a much greater extent of variation in \nthe range of domain closure observed for competitive antagonists, even though the \nnumber of antagonist structures solved is substantially less. This difference in extent \nof domain closure for antagonists clearly results from steric effects, and suggests that \nthe ligand binding cores can expand and contract to bind antagonists of different size \nand shape without activation of ion channel gating. Thus, the ligand binding domains \ndo not switch between single open and closed conformations, as required by the \nsimplest Monod Wyman Changeux models of allostery, and instead exhibit induced \nfit to accommodate a range of ligands sizes. This naturally raises the question of \nwhether there is a threshold for domain closure, the crossing of which triggers ion \nchannel gating. This is indeed true and in fact is one of the major mechanisms which \nunderlies the action of AMPA and kainate receptor partial agonists. Most work has \nbeen done for AMPA receptors, and the results suggest that even the 12° domain \nclosure produced by the partial agonist kainate produces at most a few percent of the \nactivation produced by the full agonists glutamate, AMPA, and quisqualate (4). \n \nTwo sets of experiments provide unequivocal support for a mechanism by which \nthe extent of domain closure directly controls the extent of receptor activation by \npartial agonists. The first involved measurement of both the extent of domain closure \nfor a series of 5-substituted willardiines, for which crystal structures were solved for \nthe hydro-, fluoro-, bromo-, and iodo-derivatives, as well as measurement of the \nextent of activation of GluR2 by these agonists in the presence and absence of the \nallosteric modulator cyclothiazide (18). When desensitization was blocked the results \nrevealed a strong correlation between domain closure and efficacy. Due to steric \nconstraints, the extent of domain closure was determined by size of the 5-substituent, \nand followed the sequence H > F > Br > I, with the same sequence for peak current \namplitudes. Conversely, when desensitization was intact, there was an inverse"}
{"text": "===== Page 12 =====\n262 \nMark L. Mayer \n \ncorrelation between domain closure and the amplitude of equilibrium responses; this \noccurs because the least efficacious agonists also produce the smallest extent of \ndesensitization. The logical continuation of this sequence extends to competitive \nantagonists, which of course produce neither activation nor desensitization. Studies \nwith additional compounds confirm and extend this model for partial agonist activity \nand reveal that it is common to both AMPA and kainate receptors (12, 23, 27). \nAdditional support for this mechanism came from protein engineering studies in \nwhich steric interactions with the ligand isopropenyl group were reduced by \nreplacing the wild type Leu650 side chain with the smaller threonine residue (4). As \nexpected this increased the efficacy of kainate, from 2% to 24% relative to the \nresponse to glutamate without altering the maximum response to quisqualate. \nCrystallization of the L650T mutant complex with kainate revealed a 3° increase in \ndomain closure relative to the wild type complex, but this small change in domain \nclosure has large effects on the efficiency of ion channel activation. \n \nA surprising result of these studies is the extreme sensitivity of receptor \nactivation to very small changes in domain closure, which reinforces two ideas \ndiscussed above. First, there is a threshold extent of domain closure required to \ntrigger ion channel gating, and this requires quite large movements, about a 10° \ndomain closure for AMPA receptors. Second, it is likely that the ion channel linkers \nare not rigid structures, and instead can absorb large movements of the ligand \nbinding domain without disturbing the closed conformation of the ion channel. A \nsurprising advantage come from this seemingly inefficient design: domain closure \ndue to thermal vibration of the ligand binding domains, which could cause \nspontaneous ion channel activation, and degrade the fidelity of synaptic \ntransmission, would be substantially reduced. This view presupposes that the \nmembrane embedded ion channel domain is quite rigid, but this is consistent with the \nview that has emerged from crystallographic studies on potassium channels (16). \nStructural studies on intact iGluRs are required to test these ideas. \n \nThe above picture leaves unaddressed some very important issues, which \ncomplicate any analysis of iGluR gating mechanisms. The first is that measurements of \nmacroscopic current amplitudes, which average out the activity of single ion channels, \nhide the fact that for AMPA receptors the ion channel opens to a number of substates \nvaries with concentration of glutamate (36, 38). This behavior has been successfully \nincorporated into a kinetic model for partial agonist activity in which a coupling \nconstant, which varies with domain closure, was used to describe substate occupancy \nas a function of ligand concentration (18). This model builds on prior work suggesting \nthat each ligand binding core can act somewhat independently to activate ion channel \ngating, but obtaining a realistic kinetic model of the single channel activity of AMPA \nreceptors remains a formidable goal. Surprisingly, it is less clear that the same general \nmodel can be used to describe kainate receptor gating, since the available evidence \nsuggests that concentration dependent ion channel substates may not occur (38). If true \nthis would further complicate our limited understanding of partial agonist activity, \nsince crystal structures for GluR6 reveal that as for AMPA receptors, kainic and \ndomoic acid produce intermediate degrees of domain closure consistent with their \naction as kainate receptor partial agonists. \nof lower conductance, and that the relative substate occupancy and life time of these"}
{"text": "===== Page 13 =====\nStructure and Mechanism of Action of AMPA and Kainate Receptors\n263\n \n \nA second major issue largely ignored by current models for iGluR gating arises \nfrom the fact that following the binding of glutamate, the ion channel oscillates \nbetween open and closed states, producing bursts of openings while the agonist \nremains bound. The molecular identity of the glutamate bound state when the ion \nchannel is closed is not known, but it seems unlikely that it reflects transitions \nbetween the open and closed cleft conformations observed in crystal structures for \nthe apo and glutamate bound structures. It is possible that the clam shell partially \nopens, to an extent sufficient to permit ion channel closure, perhaps to a \nconformation like that observed in the AMPA bound complex of the GluR2 L650T \nmutant (4). The extremely short open times, and relatively low conductance of \nAMPA receptor substates, complicates the experiments needed to explore these \nissues, and as discussed in the chapter by Yuan et al., much better data is starting to \nemerge for NMDA receptors, which open for longer times, and to fewer \nsubconductance states, than AMPA and kainate receptors. \n \nAlthough to a first approximation the domain closure model accounts for partial \nagonist action quite well, additional details are required to accurately describe iGluR \ngating. It is clear from the results of FTIR spectroscopy that the energy of interaction \nof the alpha carbon amine group with the receptor differs for individual ligands, and \nalthough steric mechanisms dictate the extent of domain closure possible for many \nAMPA and kainate receptor agonists, binding energy is also an important \ndeterminant of agonist efficacy (22). Recent work showing that mutations of amino \nacids in the ligand binding core of AMPA receptors that contribute to stabilization of \nthe closed cleft conformation alter agonist efficacy illustrates another example of \nhow receptor activity can be controlled (35). \n \nAny discussion of AMPA receptor gating is now incomplete without description \nof the modulatory effect of a recently discovered family of proteins named TARPs, \nshort for transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (44). There is a \ngrowing body of evidence, including studies with single particle electron microscopy \n(25), which indicate that TARPs are integral components of native AMPA receptors \nin at least some cell types. Whether this is true for all AMPA receptors is not yet \nestablished. The issue is complicated by the fact that TARPs have two distinct \nfunctions. First, in some cell types, and especially cerebellar granule cells where \ntheir biological role was first discovered (8), association of AMPA receptors with \nTARPs is essential for both cell surface expression and targeting to synapses. \nHowever, in addition to this, coexpression with TARPs modulates AMPA receptor \ngating, increasing the efficacy of activation by agonists, and slowing deactivation \nand desensitization (43). At the time of writing no TARP-like partners have been \nfound for other iGluR subtypes, but the extreme mismatch in kinetics for \nsynaptically activated kainate receptor responses with those for kainate receptors \nexpressed in heterologous systems such as HEK cells is striking, and might be \nresolved if such proteins were discovered. \n8 Modulation by Extracellular Ions \nAMPA and kainate receptors are cation permeable ion channels which under \nphysiological conditions use the transmembrane sodium ion concentration gradient"}

The extracellular and intracellular \nconcentrations of the major biological cations and anions, Na+, K+ and Cl–, are quite \ntightly regulated, albeit subject to transient changes during intense bursts of synaptic \nactivity or during spreading depression. It is thus surprising that kainate receptors in \nparticular, and AMPA receptors to a lesser extent, show profound modulation by \nchanges in monovalent ion concentration and species (6, 32). Recent structural work \nhas identified the site and mechanism of action of anions on kainate receptors, and \nreveals, unexpectedly that chloride ions are integral components of a kainate receptor \ndimer in its active conformation (33). The anion binding site shows exquisite \nselectivity, and strongly prefers chloride and bromide over fluoride and iodide; larger \norganic anions, like nitrate, methanesulfonate and sulfate also do not substitute for \nCl–. All kainate receptor subunits, i.e. GluR5, GluR6 and GluR7, expressed either \nalone or in combination with the KA1 or KA2 subunits, require chloride for normal \n \nCrystal structures of the chloride and bromide bound complexes reveal in detail \nthe mechanism of anion binding (Fig. 4). The Cl– ion shows six-fold coordination by \nthe ammonium groups of Lys516 (3.67 Å), the guanidinium groups of Arg760 (3.4 \nÅ), and a pair of equatorial water molecules (2.81 Å) which form hydrogen bonds \nwith the side chain hydroxyl groups of Thr764. The bound anion is located on the \nmolecular two-fold axis of symmetry at the dimer interface, 10 Å below the top \nsurface of domain 1, defined by the ridge of methyl groups formed by Pro758. A \nsingle Cl– or Br– ion together with two water molecules is trapped in a cavity of \nvolume 70 Å3 located between the pair of subunits in a dimer assembly. The lid of \nthe cavity is formed by a pair of intermolecular salt bridges between the side chains \nof Arg760 and Asp761. The carboxyl group of Asp761 is only 4.4 Å from the Cl– \nion, and is presumably shielded by formation of bidentate intermolecular salt bridges \nwith Arg760 of the dimer partner (2.84 and 2.91 Å) and hydrogen bond formation \nwith the trapped water molecules (2.66 Å) and solvent outside the anion binding \ncavity. The base of the cavity is formed by another pair of salt bridges formed \nbetween the side chains of Glu509 and Lys516. The structure is remarkable for the \nclose apposition of multiple charged side chains which, to a first approximation, \nform counterbalanced rings of charge around the top of the dimer interface.  \n \n \ngating. Crystallographic studies reveal that the anion binding site is formed at the D1 \ninterface between a pair of subunits in a dimer assembly, and that chloride acts as a \ncounter ion to a positively charged cavity, and thus provides electrostatic glue which \ncontributes binding energy to dimer stabilization. Consistent with this, in functional \nexperiments removal of chloride has two effects. First it accelerates the rate of onset \nof desensitization, reflecting reduced stability of the dimer assembly. Second, it \nreduces the peak current amplitude, by lowering open channel probability and the \nnumber of receptors competent for activation by glutamate. This effect was \ninterpreted as a consequence of binding of glutamate to anion free receptors resulting \nin the triggering of either of two events: dimer rearrangement before the ion channel \nopens, or normal activation, but with a reduced stability of the active conformation."}
{"text": "===== Page 15 =====\nStructure and Mechanism of Action of AMPA and Kainate Receptors\n265\n \n \n \n \nAlthough these structural results are compelling, kainate receptor crystals grown \nin different conditions did not consistently exhibit the mode of anion binding \ndescribed above. For crystals grown in the presence of high concentrations of sulfate, \nthe structural data make sense and the χ4 dihedral angle of the pair of Arg760 \nresidues in the dimer complex is rotated by 94° compared to the Cl– complex, so that \nthe guanidinium groups point upwards towards the solvent exposed SO4\n2– ion, thus \nbreaking the intermolecular salt bridges with Asp761. This is consistent with our \nfunctional studies, for which substitution of 150 mM NaCl by either 75 or 150 mM \nNa2SO4 increased the rate of onset of desensitization for GluR6 and reduced the peak \namplitude of responses to glutamate.

Esteban \nUniversity of Michigan, Department of Pharmacology, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA, \nestebanj@umich.edu \n \n1 Introduction \nIntracellular membrane trafficking is an essential process in all eukaryotic cells, but \nit is particularly critical at synaptic terminals, where a large number of specific ion \nchannels, scaffolding molecules and multiple signal transduction regulators have to \nbe precisely targeted to ensure proper synaptic function (80, 126). At the level of the \npostsynaptic terminal, local membrane trafficking is now appreciated as major factor \ncontrolling synaptic function (58). In particular, the regulation of neurotransmitter \nreceptor transport and targeting is crucial for the maintenance of synaptic strength, \nand for the activity-dependent changes associated to synaptic plasticity (19). \nMost excitatory transmission in the central nervous system is mediated by two \ntypes of glutamate receptors: γ-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic \nacid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. These two types of \nreceptors have very different roles in synaptic function (22, 51). AMPA receptors \n(AMPARs) mediate most excitatory (depolarizing) currents in conditions of basal \nneuronal activity. Hence, they have a major influence in the strength of the synaptic \nresponse. NMDA receptors (NMDARs), on the other hand, remain silent at resting \nmembrane potential (85), but they are crucial for the induction of specific forms of \nsynaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression \n(LTD) (6). Although AMPARs and NMDARs reside at the same synapses in most \nbrain regions, they traffic to the synaptic membrane through quite different pro-\ngrams. In the brain, soon after birth, most excitatory synapses in the hippocampus \nand other brain regions contain only NMDARs, whereas the prevalence of AMPARs \nincreases gradually over development (24, 53, 55, 73, 92). In fact, the delivery of \nAMPARs into synapses is a regulated process that depends on NMDAR activation \nand underlies some forms of synaptic plasticity (78). \nJ.W.
